40|$|Massive MIMO {{has been}} shown to greatly improve {{spectral}} and transmit-energy efficiency. When implementing a massive MIMO system, one challenge is high hardware complexity. A solution is {{to reduce the number of}} radio frequency (RF) transceiver chains by performing antenna selection. However, a <b>full</b> RF <b>switch</b> that connects the antennas and RF chains can be highly complex and incurs significant loss in output signal quality, especially when the number of antennas and RF chains are large. We therefore propose a simpler solution - binary switching architecture, which is sub-optimal but provides better signal quality, as compared to the <b>full</b> <b>switching</b> network. To evaluate the proposed technique, we compare the sum-rate capacity when using several different configurations of binary switching with the performance of the <b>full</b> <b>switching.</b> <b>Full</b> MIMO performance obtained without antenna selection is also presented as a reference. The investigations in this paper are all based on measured channel data at 2. 6 GHz, using a uniform linear array and a cylindrical array, both having 128 antenna elements. It is found that the proposed binary switching gives very competitive performance that are close to the <b>full</b> <b>switching,</b> for the measured channels. The results indicate a potential to simplify massive MIMO hardware by reducing the number of RF chains, and performing antenna selection with simple binary switching architecture...|$|R

5000|$|Under {{the auspices}} of Nicolas de Pigage, the garden's plan was {{thoroughly}} updated and substantially expanded, all the while preserving most of its original features.

Most of the designs he prepared for Schwetzingen, spanning a period of more than twenty years, have to be considered progressive and up-to-date. However, not all of them were carried out, and as time progressed, the prince's (and possibly also the architect's) reluctance to make a <b>full</b> <b>switch</b> towards the [...] "English" [...] style also provoked critical scorn (most notably from the garden-design theorist Christian Cay Lorenz Hirschfeld).

On the newer, more fully developed landscaped portions, Pigage collaborated closely with the up-and-coming garden designer Friedrich Ludwig von Sckell.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{decision}} of ABC TV to continue such an emphasis on screening the series during 1979, the club's membership increase continued. This was accelerated by Tom Baker's visit to Australia for an ABC TV promotional tour in February 1979. The ABC also began to give out the club's address. All {{of which was a}} stimulus to the magazine, apparently doubling sales {{by the end of the}} year. The ABC allowed the club a lengthy interview with Baker, which was the centrepiece of a Special Issue (#10/11) devoted to the Fourth Doctor's visit Down Under, with fan reports from around the country, and many photos supplied by ABC publicity, which removed any copyright difficulties. It was largely edited by Howe's mother, Rosemary, and marked the first <b>full</b> <b>switch</b> to commercial printing and double-quarto format with centrefolds of photographs. The completion of Andrew Szabo's Pyramids of Mars comic, Zerinza #12, saw a return to using the old machine as Howe became the S.U.S.F.A.'s printer on Ikin's departure to work inter-state. Howe took over the now repaired machine and used the opportunity to reprint most of the early issues in late 1979 and into 1980, which explains some dating discrepancies as reprints had the correct publication dates, since some original dates had earlier been in error due to hold ups after their date had been printed.|$|E

[...] They signed with managers, Bill Sone and Ozzie Schmidt, who were familiar with surf and the West Coast scene.

40|$|AbstractTo {{delineate}} {{the role of}} the cytoplasmic tail in the distinct binding and coupling properties of human dopamine D 1 -like receptors, chimeric receptors were generated in which the entire tail region of wild-type human D 1 A (or D 1) and D 1 B (or D 5) receptors was exchanged. The hD 1 A-D 1 BT, but not hD 1 B-D 1 AT, receptor expression was dramatically reduced compared with wild-type receptor expression. Swapping the cytoplasmic tail resulted in a <b>full</b> <b>switch</b> of dopamine binding affinity and constitutive activity, while dopamine potency decreased and agonist-mediated maximal activation of adenylyl cyclase increased for both chimeras. Hence, the cytoplasmic tail plays a crucial role in D 1 -like receptor expression, agonist binding affinity and constitutive activation but regulates in a distinct fashion the formation of D 1 A and D 1 B receptor active states upon dopamine binding...|$|E

40|$|Many {{diseases}} affect pre-mRNA splicing, {{and alternative}} splicing {{is a major}} source of proteome diversity and an important mechanism for modulating gene expression. The ability to regulate a specific splicing event is therefore desirable; for example, to understand splicing-associated pathologies. We have developed methods based on modified U 7 snRNAs, which allow us to induce efficient skipping or inclusion of selected exons. Here, we have adapted these U 7 tools to a regulatable system that relies on a doxycycline-sensitive version of the Kruppel-associated box (KRAB) /KAP 1 transcriptional silencing. Co-transduction of target cells with two lentiviral vectors, one carrying the KRAB protein and the other the regulatable U 7 cassette, allows a tight regulation of the modified U 7 snRNA. No leakage is observed in the repressed state, whereas full induction can be obtained with doxycycline in ng ml(- 1) concentrations. Only a few days are necessary for a <b>full</b> <b>switch,</b> and the induction/repression can be repeated over several cycles without noticeable loss of control. Importantly, the U 7 expression correlates with splicing correction, as shown for the skipping of an aberrant beta-globin exon created by a thalassaemic mutation and the promotion of exon 7 inclusion in the human SMN 2 gene, an important therapeutic target for spinal muscular atrophy...|$|E
40|$|Rearrangements of the {{hydrogen}} bond network of liquid water are believed to involve rapid and concerted hydrogen bond switching events, during which a hydrogen bond donor molecule undergoes large angle molecular reorientation as it exchanges hydrogen bonding partners. To test this picture of hydrogen bond dynamics, we have performed ultrafast 2 D IR spectral anisotropy measurements on the OH stretching vibration of HOD in D[subscript 2]O to directly track the reorientation of water molecules as they change hydrogen bonding environments. Interpretation of the experimental data is assisted by modeling drawn from molecular dynamics simulations, and we quantify the degree of molecular rotation on changing local hydrogen bonding environment using restricted rotation models. From the inertial 2 D anisotropy decay, we find that water molecules initiating from a strained configuration and relaxing to a stable configuration are characterized by a distribution of angles, with an average reorientation half-angle of 10 °, implying an average reorientation for a <b>full</b> <b>switch</b> of ≥ 20 °. These results provide evidence that water hydrogen bond network connectivity switches through concerted motions involving large angle molecular reorientation. United States.

40|$|Signal {{transduction}} specificity in the transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) {{system is}} determined by ligand activation of a receptor complex which then recruits and phosphorylates a subset of SMAD proteins including Smads 1 and 2. These then associate with Smad 4 and move into the nucleus where they regulate transcription. We have identified a discrete surface structure in Smads 1 and 2 that mediates and specifies their receptor interactions. This structure is the L 3 loop, a 17 amino acid region that protrudes from {{the core of the}} conserved SMAD C-terminal domain. The L 3 loop sequence is invariant among TGF-beta- and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) -activated SMADS, but differs at two positions between these two groups. Swapping these two amino acids in Smads 1 and 2 induces a gain or loss, respectively, in their ability to associate with the TGF-beta receptor complex and causes a switch in the phosphorylation of Smads 1 and 2 by the BMP and TGF-beta receptors, respectively. A <b>full</b> <b>switch</b> in phosphorylation and activation of Smads 1 and 2 is obtained by swapping both these two amino acids and four amino acids near the C-terminal receptor phosphorylation sites. These studies identify the L 3 loop as a determinant of specific SMAD-receptor interactions, and indicate that the L 3 loop, together with the C-terminal tail, specifies SMAD activation...|$|E
