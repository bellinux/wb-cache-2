Stereotyping of others, which is defined as the attribution of traits to individuals based on group membership, is often used to justify exclusion of others in social group contexts.

40|$|The Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) in British Columbia (BC), Canada, is {{a provincial}} zoning scheme {{designed}} to protect agricultural land from development. Since 1973, landowners have not been permitted to use ALR land for nonagricultural purposes, prompting some to seek recovery of development option value by applying for exclusion from the ALR. Using Geographic Information System (GIS) technology and a binary choice (logit) model, this study examines factors that impact the acceptance of ALR exclusion applications. With data from two regions in southwestern BC, we find that applications {{are more likely to}} be approved when the land is closer to the major highway, has a smaller parcel size, consists of a smaller portion of the total parcel area, or has poorer quality soils. Therefore, as intended by public policy, agricultural capability is a key determinant in <b>exclusion</b> <b>decisions,</b> retaining properties of greater agricultural value in the ALR.

40|$|We {{make the}} simple {{observation}} that, the deeper a data item {{is within the}} tree, the higher the probability of that item being excluded from a search. Assuming a fixed and independent probability p of any subtree being excluded at query time, the probability of an individual data item being accessed is (1 -p) d for a node at depth d. In a balanced binary tree half of the data {{will be at the}} maximum depth of the tree so this effect should be significant and observable. We test this hypothesis with two experiments on partition trees. First, we force a balance by adjusting the partition/exclusion criteria, and compare this with unbalanced trees where the mean data depth is greater. Second, we compare a generic hyperplane tree with a monotone hyperplane tree, where also the mean depth is greater. In both cases the tree with the greater mean data depth performs better in high-dimensional spaces. We then experiment with increasing the mean depth of nodes by using a small, fixed set of reference points to make <b>exclusion</b> <b>decisions</b> over the whole tree, so that almost all of the data resides at the maximum depth. Again this can be seen to reduce the overall cost of indexing. Furthermore, we observe that having already calculated reference point distances for all data, a final filtering can be applied if the distance table is retained. This reduces further the number of distance calculations required, whilst retaining scalability. The final structure can in fact be viewed as a hybrid between a generic hyperplane tree and a LAESA search structure...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAlthough {{already used}} in USA in the Positive Train Control (PTC) system, in China {{for the high}} {{velocity}} and low capacity lines and in Russia, the GNSS technology is still not used in the European Train Control System (ETCS). ETCS will progressively replace the different systems {{that are used in}} Europe for an improved interoperability. In ETCS level 2 and 3, the train has to self-estimate its position by propagating the position of reference given by Eurobalises with wheel speed sensors (WSS). A large amount of balise must be settled on the rail tracks in order to bound the error on the position estimation that is growing {{as a function of the}} distance travelled since the last Eurobalise due to the WSS scale factor error and sliding effects. The current trend adopted by the rail community would consist in using the GNSS as a virtual balise. The first main challenge for the introduction of the GNSS in ETCS is the very low Tolerable Hazard Risk (THR), which, for the whole signaling system, shall not be over 2. 10 - 9 /h to fulfill the Safety Integrity Level (SIL) 4 requirement [1]. Therefore, the tolerable uncertainty on the GNSS sensor shall be even lower. Depending on the risk allocation in the ETCS fault tree, the integrity risk allowed for GNSS can reach 1. 10 - 11 /h. Because the requirements are key in the design of the virtual balise platform, a proposition of accuracy and alert limit requirements is discussed in the paper. The second main challenge for the introduction of the GNSS in ETCS is related to the operational environment of the vehicle. Indeed the trains are likely to operate in suburban and in dense urban environments, where the GNSS satellites can be masked by the buildings, or where the GNSS receiver can be affected by large multipath errors, interference or Non Line-Of-Sight signals (NLOS). This paper proposes a complete positioning module that is designed to fulfill the tight integrity requirements for a virtual balise in ETCS. The navigation solution proposed is based on a combination of GNSS, Inertial Navigation Sensor (INS) and a track database that are tightly coupled through an extended Kalman filter (EKF). The widely used WSS that are present onboard are purposely not used to avoid safety issues related to the joint dependency of the odometry function and virtual balise with respect to the same sensor. Together with the positioning algorithm, it is necessary to design an integrity monitoring algorithm that will ensure that the positioning requirements are fulfilled. This paper proposes such an algorithm, which can be seen as an adaptation of Aircraft Autonomous Integrity Monitoring (AAIM) techniques that were developed for tightly coupled GPS/IRS systems in civil aviation. The considered nominal case and fault modes are described in the paper, including the presence of a major (GNSS) service failure, the presence of large multipath errors and the reception of NLOS signals. The problem caused by large multipath errors and NLOS signals on the integrity monitoring is lightened by the use of an a priori exclusion of some GNSS measurements that are likely to be faulty. The <b>exclusion</b> <b>decision</b> is based on different criteria including GNSS signal quality indicators based on the assessment of the distortion of the correlation function, the estimated C/N 0 or the satellite elevation. The proposed integrity monitoring algorithm assumes that all sensors are fault free. It is thus necessary to ensure that this condition is met. Considering this, and since the Mean Time Between Failure (MTBF) of the considered MEMS IMU is not sufficiently high to neglect the probability of failure of the IMU, a fault detection algorithm based on the redundancy of the IMUs is proposed in the paper. This algorithm, which can detect sensor failures before any use of the sensor in the position computation, is based on Kalman filtering and on a hypothesis test based on Weighted Sum of Squared Residuals (WSSR). The fault modes of the sensors are also detailed in the paper. The next step is to prove that the proposed positioning system will be able to meet an integrity risk of 1. 10 - 11 /h. In a usual system, this means that it is necessary to characterize the nominal error model of each error sources using an extremely large amount of data (to know the error model down to an extremely low percentile). To overcome this issue, the paper proposes to divide the problem in two independent ones. It thus proposed to use two different GPS/Galileo dual constellation receivers. The idea consists in dividing the available satellites into two independent subsets of satellites. The measurements from each subset are integrated with two independent IMUs. Due to the division into two separate subsets, it is likely to have less than 4 satellites available which reinforce the interest of using tight integration. The two EKF are monitored by two AAIM algorithms that provide protection levels in real time. A new estimated position and protection level is formed from the two independent positions and protection levels. As shown in the paper, this separation of the whole system into two independent sub-systems reduces the integrity risk of each subsystem down to ? 10 - 11 /h, which appears much more manageable based on the current knowledge of the GNSS error sources. Finally, this paper assesses the nominal accuracy and integrity performances of the proposed architecture by realistic simulations. Starting from a typical rail trajectory and velocity profile, ideal inertial sensor, GNSS and track database outputs are generated. Typical error models are then added based on the manufacturer specifications for the IMU and on realistic values for the GNSS. Performances of the proposed solution are finally assessed on a real measurement campaign in urban environment. The reference trajectory is given by a NovAtel SPAN equipment hybridizing a tactical-grade IMU with a high accuracy GNSS solution. The outline of this paper is the following: • The first chapter focuses on the operational requirements that must be fulfilled by the studied solution • The second chapter discusses the architecture of the hybridized solution and on the integration approach by EKF. • The third chapter addresses the failures modes and the fault detection algorithm proposed to detect them before integration of the measurements in the filter. • The fourth chapter addresses the failure modes of the GNSS. The way to lighten the burden of the integrity monitoring algorithm by using signal quality indicators and external information is discussed. The method that is used to set the integrity requirement to ? 10 - 11 /h instead of 10 - 11 /h is discussed. • The fifth chapter provides nominal fault free performances of the system in terms of accuracy and integrity based on realistic simulations. The error models of each sensors are detailed. • The last chapter assesses the performances of the solution on a real measurement campaign...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{contributes}} to the {{growing body of research}} on socially responsible investing (SRI) and institutional investment. Throughout the three main chapters of the thesis, I empirically investigate how institutional investors incorporate environmental, social and ethical considerations into their investment practices. First, I assess the impact of different political dimensions on the equity holdings of 31 U. S. state pension funds. I provide evidence that pension funds with Democratic leaning members tend to tilt their portfolios more strongly towards companies with higher environmental and social performance and that pressures by Democratic state politicians intensify this tendency. Additionally, I show that the sample funds neither under- nor outperform on their politically motivated SRI holdings, implying that their SRI preferences are unlikely financially-driven. Next, I investigate how Scandinavian public asset owners balance their financial and ethical objectives through exclusionary screening. I empirically analyse the performance effect of the exclusion of “unethical” companies from the portfolios of two leading Nordic investors, Norway’s Government Pension Fund-Global (GPFG) and Sweden’s AP-funds. I show that the portfolios of excluded companies do not generate an abnormal return relative to the funds’ benchmark indices, indicating that the <b>exclusion</b> <b>decisions</b> generally did not harm fund performance. Finally, I evaluate the extent to which investors account for the financial materiality of environmental and social factors in their shareholder activism. I find that a considerable amount of investor resources is spent on advancing immaterial issues through shareholder proposals. While certain “dedicated” investors such as public pension funds, endowments, religious institutions and asset managers are better at targeting financially material issues, the overall shareholder base does not differentiate between the financial materiality, or otherwise, of a proposal. Material proposals neither receive greater vote support nor does the market react more positively to learning that a company has been targeted by a material proposal...|$|R

40|$|Key Words Agriculture-environment interactions, {{economic}} modelling, sage grouse, yellow starthistle, urban-rural fringe, Geographic Information Systems (GIS), farmland conservation, {{direct marketing}} Agricultural land uses are frequently challenged by competing land demands for urban uses and for nature. Decisions made by private operators at the natural (extensive) and urban (intensive) margins {{of land use}} may not be socially desirable due to the externalities and public goods associated with agricultural land use and production. The objective {{of this research is}} to inform and determine the economic implications of land use policies and decisions in two agricultural systems – (1) rangeland of the arid U. S. west, and (2) the urban fringe of British Columbia, Canada – where competition for land use and associated spillovers threaten long-term agricultural sustainability. This research uses econometric methods and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to accomplish this goal. At the extensive margin, we address an issue where wildlife conservation interests challenge agricultural range uses in Nevada and another where invasive weeds reduce grazing productivity in California. We investigate the factors influencing the decline of greater sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus) populations and, using regression analysis, find that annual weather variations are dominant. Still {{there is some evidence that}} cattle grazing negatively affects sage grouse populations. We assess agricultural losses and damages due to yellow starthistle (Centaurea solstitialis L.) by using a survey administered to ranchers. Data collected included infestation rates, loss of forage quality and control efforts. Total state-wide losses of livestock forage value are calculated at 6 - 7 % of the annual harvested pasture value. Further, at the intensive margin, this research explores the economic implications of the Agricultural Land Reserve (ALR) in southwestern British Columbia. GIS technology is used to assemble spatial data of farmland near the city of Victoria. Hedonic models determine spatial, farm type and ALR protection impacts on farmland prices from 1974 through 2008, incorporating a total of 2211 parcel sales into the analysis. We find that ALR zoning reduced protected land prices over time, even though prices were impacted more by urban than agricultural production factors. Next, we analyze ALR exclusion applications from 1974 through 2006 using a logit regression model of re-zoning decisions, and find that, although approvals became more likely over time, agricultural capability is a key determinant in <b>exclusion</b> <b>decisions.</b> Finally, we explore the impact of niche- and direct-marketing on farm economic sustainability. Among farms surveyed, the majority (> 80 %) of farm area was devoted to vegetable and berry production, and more than 50 % of total sales took place on-farm. Production intensity (gross revenue per unit of land) is positively related to recent farm investments, crop diversity, and greenhouse or nursery operations; and negatively related to university education, female operators, farm area and agri-tourism.

Twelve (48 %) fathers of formula fed infants were unaware that breastfeeding was healthier for the baby. Most fathers (80. 6 %) felt that breastfeeding was the mother's decision and most (82. 1 %) felt that antenatal information was aimed at mothers only. Irish fathers remain relatively uninformed regarding the benefits of breastfeeding. This may contribute to their <b>exclusion</b> from the <b>decision</b> to breastfeed. Antenatal education should incorporate fathers more, and this may result in an improvement in our breastfeeding rates...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The life and career of Leo Amery are examined with respect to the subject of Imperial Preference. The paper explores Amery's intellectual development and the motivations behind his life-long championing of greater economic unity for the British Empire. Attention focuses on Amery's ministerial career in the 1920 s and his efforts to get the United Kingdom to adopt a protective tariff in a bid to stimulate the domestic economy while providing preferential rates to the British colonies and Dominions. The events surrounding the 1932 Ottawa Accords, Amery's <b>exclusion</b> from the <b>decision</b> making process, and the reasons for his political isolation in the 1930 s form the conclusion of the work...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is limited to the exclusionary effects of poor {{decision}} making power on children. A total of 500 children from both genders were selected by systematic sampling technique and interviewed, from seven shopping streets and seven high schools of the District Peshawar. Likert scale was used as measurement tool besides, using Chi-square test and Kendall’s Tau-b tests to check the strength and direction of association between social <b>exclusion</b> and <b>decision</b> making power. Relationship of social exclusion was significant and negative with feeling one’s self influential in molding family level decision, having membership of any organization, liberty in choice of sport, liberty in choice of dress/shoes and people listen to child’s views. At multivariate level the association of social exclusion in male and female children varied by means of power of decision making. Likewise, results of groups based on religious affiliations indicated a spurious relationship between power of making decision in children and their social exclusion. However, result of groups based on joint and nuclear family affiliation indicated a non-spurious relationship between power of making decision in children and their social exclusion; conversely, single parent family group had a spurious relationship with above two groups. Contrariwise, result of groups based on sufficiency of family income indicated a non-spurious relationship between power of making decision in children and their social exclusion. A welfare state while safeguarding employment to all income segments, ensuring child’s constructive social participation at family and community level activities, reintegration of family role in child’s physical, social and psychological care and socialization, and overcoming gender and religion based disparities in the society were some of the policy recommendations in light of the study...|$|R
40|$|First made {{available}} online in May 2015. It {{has long been}} established that pay formulas containing an element of profit-sharing have non-inflationary employment promotion properties (Vanek, 1965), except in self-managed enterprises (e. g. Vanek, 1970). In recent literature economy-wide profit-sharing combined with workers' strict <b>exclusion</b> from employment <b>decisions</b> is being promoted as a scheme guaranteeing the achievement of a blissful state of non-inflationary excess demand for labour, absorbing {{all or part of}} possible deflationary shocks (Weitzman, 1983, 1984, 1985 a, 1985 b, 1986). Weitzman's proposal is reminiscent of the set-up in Catch- 22, where a wheeler-dealer retrades and speculates with army supplies originally meant for the soldiers, who are supposed instead to benefit from their share in the profit of his operations; everybody has a share, nobody has a say, and the main beneficiary of the scheme is its proposer. The {{purpose of this paper is}} that of separating the beneficial effects of profit-sharing which are neither new nor controversial from the new propositions put forward by Weitzman which I shall argue to be overclaims...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Our aim in {{this study}} was to examine the {{competing}} interest policies and procedures of organisations who develop and maintain patient decision aids. DESIGN: Descriptive and thematic analysis of data collected from a cross-sectional survey of patient decision aid developer's competing interest policies and disclosure forms. RESULTS: We contacted 25 organisations likely to meet the inclusion criteria. 12 eligible organisations provided data. 11 organisations did not reply and 2 declined to participate. Most patient decision aid developers recognise the need to consider the issue of competing interests. Assessment processes vary widely and, for the most part, are insufficiently robust to minimise the risk of competing interests. Only half of the 12 organisations had competing interest policies. Some considered disclosure to be sufficient, while others imposed differing levels of <b>exclusion.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Patient <b>decision</b> aid developers do not have a consistent approach to managing competing interests. Some have developed policies and procedures, while others pay no attention to the issue. As is the case for clinical practice guidelines, increasing attention will need to be given to how the competing interests of contributors of evidence-based publications may influence materials, especially if they are designed for patient use...|$|R
40|$|Audy Magazine, {{a monthly}} {{magazine}} {{for women in}} Chad, worked in collaboration with two local NGOs, the Centre d’Etude, de Formation et d’Appui aux Initiatives de Développement (CEFAID) and the community radio station of the Bureau d’Etudes et de Liaison des Activités Caritatives de Développement (BELACD) to help women's associations {{in the province of}} East Logone organize and facilitate community radio listening groups. In {{the first phase of the}} project, more than 60 women, representing 18 women's associations, were trained as facilitators. These associations are active in various fields, including supporting women entrepreneurs, setting up mutual aid, savings and credit schemes, and carrying out community work and literacy campaigns. During the training, the participants discussed many issues, such as the role of women in society, women and agriculture, opportunities for the development of women, and the need to encourage women entrepreneurs. All of these issues were discussed in a spirit of change. The women openly discussed their lives and the many challenges they face, in particular their <b>exclusion</b> from <b>decision</b> making and the heavy burden of working in the fields. Journalists from the BELACD radio station attended the training sessions to record the discussions. In the second phase, the project helped the newly trained facilitators to set up listening groups among members of their associations. Thanks to the GenARDIS grant, Audy Magazine was able to provide each group with a radio, enabling them to listen to the recorded discussions, which were broadcast three times week. After each broadcast, the facilitators encouraged the group members to reflect on the discussions and to suggest new topics for discussion. As women are often prevented from using the radio at home by their husbands, the listening groups offer many of them an unprecedented opportunity to listen to the radio and to discuss issues that are important to their lives. Grâce Agouna is Publishing Director of Audy Magazine. Grâce Agouna describes how radio listening groups help women in the province of East Logone to improve their lives...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper investigates ways {{in which}} context can be enriched, {{permitting}} identification of new resources and pathways for innovative decision making in situations where the restricted languages of conventional decision analysis offer only social <b>exclusion</b> to the <b>decision</b> makers. It describes how young decision makers in “socially excluded” communities authored and exchanged multimedia communications including audio-visual strata founded in rich language and contexts (which can support innovative conceptualisation and generate new possibilities for exploration) as well as strata employing restricted language and contexts (appropriate in assessment and monitoring these possibilities and in making tradeoffs and deciding between alternatives – a necessary precondition for turning fantasy into real action). It illustrates how the language of each stratum not only provided {{a different way of}} generating stories about what is, what could be, and what could be done about it, but also generated a different way of understanding the context in which such observations and potential actions are situated. Communicating in this way empowered the decision makes to discover new resources and implement new pathways through exploring enriched context. Their decision situations were no longer flat but integrated as strata in an arena founded on their own preferences and communications in extended language. ...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the central}} {{questions}} in free speech jurisprudence is what activities the First Amendment encompasses. This Article considers that question {{in the context of}} an area of increasing importance – algorithm-based decisions. I begin by looking to broadly accepted legal sources, which for the First Amendment means primarily Supreme Court jurisprudence. That jurisprudence provides for very broad First Amendment coverage, and the Court has reinforced that breadth in recent cases. Under the Court’s jurisprudence the First Amendment (and the heightened scrutiny it entails) would apply to many algorithm-based decisions, specifically those entailing substantive communications. We could of course adopt a limiting conception of the First Amendment, but any nonarbitrary <b>exclusion</b> of algorithm-based <b>decisions</b> would require major changes in the Court’s jurisprudence. I believe that First Amendment coverage of algorithm-based decisions is too small a step to justify such changes. But insofar as we are concerned about the expansiveness of First Amendment coverage, we may want to limit it in two areas of genuine uncertainty: editorial decisions that are neither obvious nor communicated to the reader, and laws that single out speakers but do not regulate their speech. Even with those limitations, however, an enormous and growing amount of activity will be subject to heightened scrutiny absent a fundamental reorientation of First Amendment jurisprudence...|$|R
