5|$|Between 1793 and 1795, Saint Lucian Tower and its battery were {{strengthened}} with a {{ditch and}} an entrenchment-like enclosure, and the complex was renamed Fort Rohan after the reigning Grand Master, Emmanuel de Rohan-Polduc. Most of the fortifications, {{with the exception}} of the tower itself, were dismantled and rebuilt by the British later on in the 19th century and the name Fort Rohan fell into <b>disuse.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cambridge Castle, locally {{also known}} as Castle Mound, is located in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England. Originally built after the Norman conquest to control the {{strategically}} important route {{to the north of}} England, it {{played a role in the}} conflicts of the Anarchy, the First and Second Barons' Wars. Hugely expanded by Edward I, the castle then fell rapidly into <b>disuse</b> in the late medieval era, its stonework recycled for building purposes in the surrounding colleges. Cambridge Castle was refortified during the English Civil War but once again fell into <b>disuse,</b> used primarily as the county gaol. The castle gaol was finally demolished in 1842, with a new prison built in the castle bailey. This prison was demolished in 1932, replaced with the modern Shire Hall, and only the castle motte and limited earthworks still stand. The site is open to the public daily and offers views over the historic buildings of the city.|$|E
5|$|Certain astronomical objects {{known as}} spiral nebulae such as M31 {{would later be}} {{recognized}} as conglomerations of stars when the true distance to these objects began to be discovered, {{and they would be}} deemed island universes. However, the word Universe was later understood to mean the entirety of existence, so this expression fell into <b>disuse</b> and the objects instead became known as galaxies.|$|E

5|$|Historically, {{the term}} great {{hurricane}} {{was used to}} describe storms that possessed winds of at least 110kn (125mph; 200km/h), large radii (over 160km / 100mi) and that caused large amounts of destruction. This term fell into <b>disuse</b> after {{the introduction of the}} Saffir–Simpson scale in the early 1970s.|$|E
5|$|In 1064, {{following}} the Seljuk conquest of Ani, the cathedral was {{converted into a}} mosque. It later returned to being used as an Armenian church. It eventually suffered damage in a 1319 earthquake when its conical dome collapsed. Subsequently, Ani was gradually abandoned and the church fell into <b>disuse.</b> The north-western corner of the church was heavily damaged by a 1988 earthquake.|$|E
5|$|St Mary's Church, Rhodogeidio {{is a small}} medieval church, {{dating from}} the 15th century, near Llannerch-y-medd, in Anglesey, north Wales.

5|$|The {{area and}} the {{surrounding}} chase were subject to forest law, as a Royal forest. In the early period, this would have meant harsh punishments for residents that poached livestock or encroached on other Royal entitlements. By Tudor times, royal lands had become used as commons and forest law had fallen into <b>disuse.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{noble gases}} are colorless, odorless, tasteless, and {{nonflammable}} under standard conditions. They were once labeled group0 in {{the periodic table}} because it was believed they had a valence of zero, meaning their atoms cannot combine {{with those of other}} elements to form compounds. However, it was later discovered some do indeed form compounds, causing this label to fall into <b>disuse.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{transfer}} of {{the headquarters of the}} Company's power to Bombay largely eliminated the need for a Deputy Governor. In spite of the change, the title continued to be borne by the second member of the Executive Council of the Governor. It fell into <b>disuse</b> sometime between 1720 and 1758.|$|E

5|$|They {{believe it}} is a Christianity {{that is in the}} New Testament; that it has always been there, that in the drift of ages it was lost through <b>disuse</b> and neglect, and that this benefactor has found it and given it back to men, turning the night of life into day, its terrors into myths, its lamentations into songs of {{emancipation}} and rejoicing.|$|E
5|$|A Bronze Age {{cemetery}} and {{the remains of}} an Iron Age settlement have been discovered in the village. Historians also believe Navenby was a significant staging point on the Roman Ermine Street, as the Romans are reported to have maintained a small base or garrison in the village. Navenby became a market town after receiving a charter from Edward the Confessor in the 11th century. The charter was later renewed by William Rufus, Edward III and Richard II. When the market fell into <b>disuse</b> in the early 19th century, Navenby returned to being a village.|$|E
5|$|After it {{fell into}} <b>disuse</b> during the Bronze Age, Maeshowe was re-opened and used centuries later by Vikings from about the 9th to the 12th centuries AD. The Norsemen left {{a series of}} runic {{inscriptions}} on the stone walls of the chamber, {{some of which were}} left by a group of crusaders in the winter of 115354. Over thirty individual inscriptions remain, one of the largest such collections in Europe.|$|E

5|$|After the Roman Empire {{collapsed}} and the aqueduct fell into <b>disuse,</b> the Pont du Gard remained largely intact, {{due to the}} importance of its secondary function, as a toll bridge. For centuries the local lords and bishops were responsible for its upkeep, in exchange for the right to levy tolls on travellers using it to cross the river, although some of its stones were looted and serious damage was inflicted on it in the 17th century. It attracted increasing attention starting in the 18th century, and became an important tourist destination.|$|E
5|$|Although {{some work}} was done to {{strengthen}} the structure in the 1960s, the complex was allowed to fall into disrepair. Also during the 1960s, some sections of the complex began to be left unoccupied and others burned down including an engine block. During this period, parts of the complex were used for light industrial use before they too fell into <b>disuse.</b> In the 1990s, the buildings fell victim to vandalism and arson that threatened to destroy {{what remained of the}} site.|$|E
5|$|Bristol sent three {{ships to}} the Royal Navy fleet against the Spanish Armada in 1588, and also {{supplied}} two levies {{of men to}} the defending land forces. Despite appeals to the Privy Council no reimbursement was made for these supplies. The corporation also had to repair the walls and gates of the city. The castle had fallen into <b>disuse</b> in the late Tudor era, but the City authorities {{had no control over}} royal property and the precincts became a refuge for lawbreakers.|$|E
