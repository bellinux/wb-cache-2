5|$|In towns, the Cape sparrow {{competes with}} both the native {{southern}} <b>grey-headed</b> <b>sparrow</b> and house sparrow, which was introduced to southern Africa in the 19thcentury. Since it is more established around humans in its range than either, it successfully competes with both species, though they may exclude it from nesting in holes. A survey by birdwatchers completed in 2000 found the Cape sparrow increasing in abundance in some suburban areas of South Africa (the northern Johannesburg area, and Pietermaritzburg) and decreasing in others (the southern Cape Town area). The house sparrow was reported decreasing in several urban areas, {{as it has in}} parts of Europe, declines which are attributed to factors including the increasing density of garden plantings and increases in predation.|$|E
5|$|Cape sparrows {{primarily}} eat seeds, {{and also}} eat soft plant parts and insects. They typically breed in colonies, and when not breeding they gather in large nomadic flocks {{to move around}} in search of food. The nest can be constructed in a tree, a bush, a cavity, or a disused nest of another species. A typical clutch contains three or four eggs, and both parents are involved in breeding, from nest building to feeding young. The Cape sparrow is common in most of its range and coexists successfully in urban habitats with two of its relatives, the native southern <b>grey-headed</b> <b>sparrow</b> and the house sparrow, an introduced species. The Cape sparrow's population has not been recorded decreasing significantly, {{and it is not}} seriously threatened by human activities, so it is assessed as a species of least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).|$|E
5|$|The Cape sparrow {{was first}} {{described}} by Philipp Ludwig Statius Müller in 1776, as Loxia melanura. Some other earlier biologists described the Cape sparrow in Loxia or Fringilla, {{but it has}} otherwise been regarded {{as a member of}} the genus Passer along with the house sparrow and other sparrows of the Old World. Within this genus, morphological comparisons and geography were insufficient to elucidate to which species the Cape sparrow is most closely related. Mitochondrial DNA phylogenies have strongly suggested that the Cape sparrow is among the most basal members of its genus, having diverged from the rest of the genus during the late Miocene, over 5million years ago. It is genetically closest to the southern <b>grey-headed</b> <b>sparrow</b> and the other grey-headed sparrows of Africa and the saxaul sparrow of Central Asia, so these species may be sibling species of the Cape sparrow or similarly early offshoots.|$|E
5|$|The {{courtship}} {{display is}} poorly recorded. Ornithologist J.

In the house sparrow a similar display exists, in which a female who is not ready to copulate is chased by her mate, who is joined by other males. It is not known if the display in the Cape sparrow has a similar significance. When ready to mate, the female crouches in solicitation and is mounted by the male. Instances of hybridisation with the house sparrow, the southern <b>grey-headed</b> <b>sparrow,</b> and captives or escapees of the Sudan golden sparrow have been reported.|$|E
500|$|Premaxillae, {{the only}} bones from which Passer predomesticus is known, are {{generally}} {{relatively easy to}} determine in birds. Tchernov found that the two premaxillae of P.predomesticus most closely resembled the house and Spanish sparrows, but were distinct from either. In P.predomesticus, there is a central, longitudinal groove with raised margins running along the lower (ventral) side of the premaxilla. In contrast, the house and Spanish sparrows have a narrow crest in this position, which is more prominent in the house sparrow. In the great sparrow, Cape sparrow (Passer melanurus), and southern <b>grey-headed</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Passer diffusus), this crest is more poorly developed, and they may even have a shallow groove {{at the front of}} the premaxilla, not nearly as well-developed as the groove in P.predomesticus.

500|$|The saxaul sparrow's {{relations}} {{within the}} genus Passer are unclear, although with its black throat feathering it has usually been {{considered part of}} the [...] "Palaearctic black-bibbed sparrow" [...] group related to the house sparrow. J. Denis Summers-Smith considered that the Palaearctic Passer sparrows evolved about 25,000 to 15,000 years ago, during the last glacial period. During this time, sparrows would have been isolated in ice-free refugia, such as a certain steppe region in Central Asia, where Summers-Smith suggested the saxaul sparrow evolved. Genetic and fossil evidence suggest a much earlier origin for the Passer species, perhaps in the Miocene and Pliocene, as suggested by Luis Allende and colleagues in their 2001 phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA. This analysis also suggested that the saxaul sparrow may be an early offshoot or basal species in its genus, a relative of certain African sparrows such as the northern <b>grey-headed</b> <b>sparrow.</b> If the saxaul sparrow is related to these species, either the saxaul sparrow formerly occurred in the deserts of Africa and Arabia, or each of the groups of Passer sparrows are of African origin.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>grey-headed</b> <b>sparrow</b> (Passer griseus), {{also known}} as the grey-headed or common <b>grey-headed</b> <b>sparrow,</b> is a species of bird in the sparrow family Passeridae, which is resident in much of tropical Africa.

50|$|Passer sparrows are {{primarily}} ground-feeding seed-eaters, though they also consume small insects especially when breeding.

40|$|The House Sparrow Passer domesticus, an {{introduced}} species, and the <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>Sparrow</b> Passer griseus, {{an indigenous}} species, are sympatric in Malawi. Their {{distribution in the}} country and any possible interactions were studied, principally in southern Malawi. A morphological analysis of museum specimens confirmed that grey-headed sparrows in Malawi belong to the Northern <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>Sparrow</b> Passer griseus as distinct from the Southern <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>Sparrow</b> Passer diffusus. This species was widely distributed in the, country in association with human dwellings, both in rural areas as well as urban centres. In the northern region Greyheaded Sparrows were more abundant in the urban centres than rural areas, but in the central and southern regions numbers in the rural and urban areas were more or less the same. In Blantyre City, where they are in sympatry with the House Sparrow, they were found in the low density and industrial areas and were absent from the high density areas. The House Sparrow, arrived in Malawi in 1967 at Chileka in the southern region. Since then it has spread northwards, moving from the southern to the central and northern regions. House Sparrow numbers were found to be progressively larger in the southern region and lowest in the northern region. House Sparrows were found at sites where food was readily available, as in the immediate vicinity of houses. In the central and northern regions they were restricted mainly to urban areas. In the southern region, they occur both in rural and urban areas, probably as a reflection of the larger period of colonization in the south. In the northern region their movement has apparently been restricted by geographical barriers. In Blantyre City Grey-headed Sparrows preferred areas where tree density was high and house density was low, while House Sparrows preferred areas where house density was high and tree density was low. There was a positive correlation between Greyheaded Sparrow numbers and tree density and a negative correlation with house density. House Sparrow abundance was negatively correlated with tree density and positively correlated with house density. Grey-headed Sparrows bred in the rainy season, whereas House Sparrows bred throughout the year. There were differences in nest site selection: Grey-headed Sparrows used artificial structures such as fencing poles, and wooden telephone or electricity poles. The House Sparrow used mostly buildings and nested in crevices, holes in walls and between the walls and rafters. Nest height also differed- Grey-headed Sparrows nested at heights ranging from 1 - 8 m while House Sparrow nests were at heights of 1 - 5 m. Moult data suggests that although the House Sparrows breed throughout the year, they moult at a particular time of the year when breeding is less common. Grey-headed Sparrows were found to moult mainly from May to September in southern Africa and from June to September in central Africa. In both cases the breeding season extends over a similar period from about October to April/May of the following year. Peak moult periods differed between the House Sparrows and Grey-headed Sparrows. House Sparrows moulted mainly {{in the first half of}} the year, and Greyheaded Sparrows in the second six months. The clutch sizes of the two species were similar (mean 3. 9 eggs for the House Sparrow and 3. 4 for the <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>Sparrow).</b> The clutch size of the House Sparrow varied seasonally and was larger from November to May. The average incubation period for the House Sparrow was 11. 5 days and the fledging period 15. 4 days. The <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>Sparrow</b> fledging period was 14. 7 days. Chick mortality of the House Sparrow at Chikunda farm was attributed to starvation resulting from brood reduction, abandonment, predation, low birth weight, accidental deaths and parasitism by fly larvae. Both Grey-headed and House Sparrows fed their young on insect food. Male House Sparrows fed actively initially, but their contribution declined from about day five onwards. In the <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>Sparrow,</b> both parents fed their young equally throughout the nestling period. House Sparrows fed on the ground near houses; Grey-headed Sparrows fed both on the ground away from houses and in tree canopies. The <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>Sparrow</b> walked as it fed on the ground as opposed to the House sparrow which hopped. Grey-headed Sparrows fed mainly as pairs and singletons while House Sparrows fed as family groups. Larger feeding groups of Grey-headed Sparrows were seen in the northern region at areas where food was plentiful. Where the two sparrows were seen feeding together, there was no direct competition for food. Where individual distance was violated; male House Sparrows displaced Grey-headed Sparrows which landed too close to them. Overall it appears that the distribution of the two species is determined more by their responses to habitat conditions than by interspecific interactions...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} diet {{composition}} of Northern <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>Sparrow</b> Passer griseus and Southern Red Bishop Euplectes orix in four localities of the Rusizi Plain, northwest Burundi. We analyzed crop contents of 100 adults {{from each of}} the two species and the composition of food brought by parents to nestlings of the sparrow at ten nests. In all four sites, the sparrow’s diet consisted primarily of rice. The bishop also fed mostly on rice grains but also ate Lepidoptera caterpillars, some other insects and wild grass seeds such as Panicum sp. and Brachiaria sp. For adults of both bird species, there was no significant variation in diet throughout the year. However, the diet of young sparrows was much more diverse and changed from the day of hatching until fledging. On the day of hatching, chicks ate mainly caterpillars but by the tenth day, food items comprised one third caterpillars, one third Orthoptera and the rest of other insects including Odonata, Dictyoptera, Isoptera and adult Lepidoptera. After this and until fledging, the chicks were fed increasingly on rice seeds. Simultaneously, the proportion of caterpillars taken gradually decreased until none was fed to the nestlings {{at the end of the}} nestling period. The items brought by parents also varied with time of day, with caterpillars and grasshoppers in higher proportions in the morning, decreasing around mid-day and then increasing in the evening.

40|$|A {{total of}} 117 bird species has been {{recorded}} in Sehlabathebe National Park, south-east Lesotho, consisting of 29 vagrants, 18 visitors and 70 breeding and probable breeding residents. For each species status was determined and abundance roughly estimated. Quantitative studies on breeding bird communities were carried out {{by means of the}} line transect method on four transects with the total length ca 30 km in the park and on two transects with the total length of ca 20 km outside the park. In the park, dominant species were represented by the Stonechat Saxicola torquata, Ayres ’ Cisticola Cisticola ayresii, Yellow-rumped Widow Euplectes capensis and Wailing Cisticola Cisticola lais. Outside the park dominants were represented by Cape Weaver Ploceus capensis, Cape Sparrow Passer melanurus, Cape Canary Serinus canicollis, Common Quail Coturnix coturnix, Stonechat, Cape Bunting Emberiza capensis and Drakensberg Siskin Pseudochloroptila symonsi. Characteristic, high-altitude species in the park included Drakensberg Siskin, Mountain Pipit Anthus hoeschi, Orange-breasted Rockjumper Chaetops auriantius, Banded Martin Riparia cincta and Sentinel Rock Thrush Monticola explorator. Species such as the Laughing Dove Streptopelia senegalensis, Sicklewinged Chat Cercomela sinuata, Mountain Chat Oenanthe monticola, Thick-billed Lark Galerida magnirostris, Red-winged Starling Onychognathus morio, Alpine Swift Apus melba Cape Sparrow, <b>Grey-headed</b> <b>Sparrow</b> Passer diffusus, Red Bishop Euplectes orix and Golden Bishop Euplectes afer were absent or occurred in very low densities in the park, although they are widespread and common in the Maluti/Drakensberg grasslands (including areas neighbouring to the park). The lack of trees and shrubs for nesting, the lack of cultivated fields as feeding places and competition with related species both for food and nesting sites, may partly play a role in this regard...|$|E
40|$|Introduced {{species are}} the {{greatest}} threat to biodiversity after habitat loss. Understanding the processes that permit organisms to become successful invaders may provide opportunities to prevent or limit their dispersal and establishment and thereby alleviate some of their harmful effects. The goal of my dissertation research has been to investigate whether invasive species have distinctive interactions with parasites, and some of the mechanisms that may underlie that variation. I used one of the world 2 ̆ 7 s most successful vertebrate invaders as a case study: the house sparrow (Passer domesticus; Introduction). Previous research in the house sparrow suggested that loss of parasite diversity may contribute to invasion success. However, my work demonstrates that infection with common avian malaria parasites is primarily a function of environmental heterogeneity and is not a predictor of time since introduction for house sparrows that are currently expanding their range in Kenya (Chapter 1). Interestingly, in spite of {{a large proportion of the}} population being infected with avian malaria, a state that should reduce competitive ability of house sparrow populations, this species is still able to establish themselves among native competitors. Though there are a number of potential mechanisms that could explain this pattern, one of the most convincing explanations is that house sparrows, and perhaps other introduced species, have adaptive differences in immunity. As such, the findings of Chapter 1 inspired two studies in which my collaborators and I showed that house sparrows from two non-native populations seem capable of maintaining normal health, performance and behavior during immune challenge, a response often referred to as parasite tolerance. Specifically, in Chapter 2, we found that when Floridian house sparrows, established since 1870, were challenged with synthetic pathogens that mimicked infection with a fungi, an RNA virus or Gram-negative bacteria, only individuals challenged by the synthetic bacteria showed measurable sickness behaviors and secretion of an inflammatory protein. In Chapter 3, we compared parasite tolerance in Kenyan house sparrows (introduced in 2000) and a native congener, the <b>grey-headed</b> <b>sparrow</b> (P. griseus) to a common intestinal parasite of songbirds. We found that both species were tolerant in that they were able to maintain fat reserves, protein reserves and vertical flight ability during infection. However, house sparrows maintained burdens that were, on average, more than 10 x those of grey-headed sparrows. Moreover, when examining nutrient allocation in the two species, house sparrows appeared to assimilate nutrients more efficiently than grey-headed sparrows and did not change how nutrients were allocated among immune and reproductive organs during experimental infection. Grey-headed sparrows, however, did shift nutrient allocation among immune and reproductive organs during experimental infection. Together, the larger nutrient pool and maintenance of nutrient allocation patterns in challenged house sparrows suggests that no physiological trade-offs occurred and that house sparrows experienced a lower cost of parasite exposure. In the fourth Chapter, I explored why house sparrows had such high coccidia burdens in comparison to their congeners. We suspected burden was a function of the frequency of exposure to coccidia. Consequently, we explored heterogeneity in foraging preferences and other behaviors in Floridian house sparrows and their role in coccidia burden. As expected, we found that house sparrows did not avoid contaminated food. In fact, they ate contaminated and uncontaminated foods indiscriminately. What was surprising was a lack of correlation between burden and consumption of contaminated foods and all of the behaviors we monitored (i. e., aggression, activity, feeding rates and defecation frequency). Overall, these data suggest that house sparrows do not benefit from typical parasite-avoidance behaviors. In sum, this dissertation research implies that house sparrows respond to parasite infection differently than many other known vertebrates, most likely in an effort to maximize efficient use of resources and, in so doing, augment competitive ability and invasion success...|$|E
