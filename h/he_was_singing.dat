500|$|Yankovic later {{noted that}} {{recording}} the song's vocals was particularly difficult, because <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> [...] "for eight to 12 hours a day", which caused strain on his vocal cords. For the verse where Yankovic mumbles {{the lyrics to}} the song, he placed several cookies in his mouth to achieve the garbled effect. During the parody's musical interlude, Yankovic gargled water {{to the tune of}} the original's guitar solo. The solo also features kazoos and a tuba, with the latter being played by Tommy Johnson.|$|E

Mutual's Chicago affiliate [...] WGN radio threatened to stop carrying the Weems broadcasts from Chicago's Palmer House if Weems's new singer did not improve. Weems had recordings of some previous radio programs; one evening he and Como listened to them after the show. From listening to them, Como was shocked to realize that no one could make out the words to the songs <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing.</b> Weems told Como {{there was no need for}} him to resort to vocal tricks; what was necessary was to sing from the heart.|$|E
500|$|Alongside the [...] "cheating" [...] rumors, {{the public}} {{inferred}} from the lyrics that Usher had impregnated a mistress in real life. Usher, however, emphasized {{that he was}} not in a relationship and [...] "got another girl pregnant" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> a [...] "character". The similarity of situations he faced before and experiences of his friends collectively inspired him to write the song. In the middle of rumors, Dupri admitted that the stories behind the songs in the album are his.

Cobain was still working on the album's lyrics well into the recording of Nevermind. Additionally, Cobain's phrasing on the album {{is often difficult to}} understand. Vig asserted that clarity of Cobain's singing was not paramount. Vig said, [...] "Even though you couldn't quite tell what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> about, you knew it was intense as hell." [...] Cobain would later complain when rock journalists attempted to decipher his singing and extract meaning from his lyrics, writing [...] "Why in the hell do journalists insist on coming up with a second-rate Freudian evaluation of my lyrics, when 90 percent of the time they've transcribed them incorrectly?" ...|$|E

500|$|Apple Records {{released}} [...] "Photograph", {{backed by}} [...] "Down and Out", on 24 September 1973 in America, and on 19 October in Britain. Starr made a promotional film for [...] "Photograph", {{in which he}} mimed to the song while walking through the grounds of Tittenhurst Park, the Berkshire estate that he had recently purchased from former bandmate John Lennon. To circumvent the BBC's ban on lip-synching, Starr placed {{his hand over his}} mouth for part of the song, thereby making it impossible to tell whether <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> or merely miming. The single's picture sleeve consisted of a photo by Barry Feinstein that showed Starr's head poking through a large star made of silver foil. The same image, which author Bruce Spizer terms [...] "the Ringo starfish", appeared on the single's face labels and on those of the Ringo album.|$|E

Individually, when still young, they developed a fascination with music; both listened to the radio and were taken with rock and roll as it emerged, particularly the Everly Brothers. When Simon first noticed Garfunkel, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>singing</b> in a fourth grade talent show, and Simon thought that was a good way to attract girls; he hoped for a friendship which eventually started in 1953 when they were in the sixth grade and appeared on stage together in a school play adaptation of Alice in Wonderland. That first stage appearance was followed by the duo forming a street-corner doo-wop group, the Peptones, with three other friends, and learning to harmonize together. [...] They began performing {{for the first time as}} a duo at school dances.|$|E
