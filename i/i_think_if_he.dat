500|$|Following pleas from Brown {{to resurrect}} Nick, John Altman {{returned}} to the serial again in December 2008, in a storyline that saw Nick attempt to con Dot again, this time aided by a previously unheard of daughter, Dotty (Molly Conlin). [...] Altman explained: [...] "Nick needed something, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn’t have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, she would just have treated him as a complete outcast." [...] As the storyline progressed, {{it was revealed that}} Nick and Dotty had intentions to kill Dot for her inheritance; they concocted a plan to make her think she had developed dementia then overdose her with sleeping pills, which fails when Dotty has a change of heart and Nick flees once again after causing an explosion and being disowned by Dot.|$|E
2500|$|On Jean Renoir, he said: [...] "I think Renoir is {{the only}} filmmaker who's {{practically}} infallible, who has never made a mistake on film. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> never made mistakes, it's because he always found solutions based on simplicity—human solutions. He's one film director who never pretended. He never tried to have a style, and if you know his work—which is very comprehensive, since he dealt {{with all sorts of}} subjects—when you get stuck, especially as a young filmmaker, you can think of how Renoir would have handled the situation, and you generally find a solution".|$|E
2500|$|On 2 October 2008 it was {{reported}} that Nick would return to EastEnders on Christmas Day that year after more than seven years away. Executive producer Diederick Santer spoke of his excitement at Nick's return, hailing the character as an [...] "EastEnders legend" [...] and [...] "one of the show's best-remembered and best-loved villains". Altman stated: [...] "After an absence of seven years, I am thrilled to return to Albert Square. The BBC have always given me great storylines as Nick Cotton and I look forward to seeing if Nick will once again spread fear and loathing throughout the Square!" [...] June Brown revealed that she had been asking producers to bring Altman back to the soap for 6 or 7 years, as the two of them share such a good working relationship. After spending time in Walsall, Cotton returns; walking normally again, and he is accompanied by his seven-year-old daughter, Dotty. He explained that he had met Dotty's mother Sandy while living in a squat, and that she was an alcoholic who had recently died, leaving him with custody of Dotty. Altman explained: [...] "Nick needed something, because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> didn’t have little Dotty, for him to walk through that door, she would just have treated him as a complete outcast." [...] The actor described other changes to his character since his last appearance, detailing how he had become a plumber, begun dressing more smartly, stopped gelling his hair back and no longer wore an earring.|$|E

2500|$|Kevin Harvick {{dominated}} {{the race to}} score the victory. [...] "Wow. I guess that's {{what it feels like}} to hit a walkoff in extra innings. I mean this thing -- both races here -- has been bad to the bone," [...] Harvick said after winning his fourth race at this 1-mile oval in the last five tries. Harvick would not have made the final four to race for the title without a win. I could tell that we were going to have to win because everybody was running in the front of the pack that we were racing against. I think this says a lot about our team. We had our backs against the wall. We're in victory lane and we get to go on." [...] In the final turn, Ryan Newman sent Kyle Larson into the wall to secure his place in the championship race. “I just gave it my all,” Newman said. “I wasn’t proud of it but did what I had to get to this next round. That little boy has got a lot of things coming in this sport and he used me up like that in a truck at Eldora a couple years ago. From my standpoint, I call it even but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was in my position, he’d have done the same thing.” [...] "Coming to the finish, there were a lot of cars racing really hard,” said Larson today. “I knew (Newman) was right around me and knew he needed to gain some spots to keep from getting eliminated from the Chase. It's a little upsetting he pushed me up to the wall, but I completely understand the situation he was in,” said Larson, “(I) can't fault him for being aggressive there. I think a lot of drivers out here would have done something similar if they were in that position." [...] Kevin Harvick (with the much-needed win), Joey Logano, Denny Hamlin, and Ryan Newman were the four drivers who will race for the championship, which also meant that NASCAR will be having a new Sprint Cup Series champion. Jeff Gordon, Carl Edwards, Brad Keselowski, and Matt Kenseth were the four drivers eliminated.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't care to hear," [...] said Kenton. [...] "All I {{want is for}} him to {{keep away}} from me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> spoke to me I should kill him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not very, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{makes us}} sit down thirteen, and leaves Miss Eden {{with no one}} to take her in. But you can judge for yourself, for here he is--I am so glad!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You’ll soon know <b>if</b> <b>he</b> comes out," [...] {{said the}} mate. [...] "He’s the worst-tempered man afloat, <b>I</b> should <b>think.</b> <b>If</b> <b>he</b> {{comes out and}} finds you here, I don’t know what he’ll do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Such {{a lot of}} old colours. There {{are only}} three vacancies, and Henfrey got one of those a week ago. I expect they'll give one of the other two to a bowler, Neville-Smith, <b>I</b> should <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> does well against Geddington. Then there'll be only the last place left." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> he {{was going}} to hunt {{elephants}} with it, because I know, from remarks dropped by him, that he has hunted large game in India and Africa, and likes it. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> tries to hunt elephants with it, {{he is going to be}} disappointed.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{knew you}} were somewhere in this vicinity, {{but he did not}} know that the camps were so close to each other. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had {{imagined}} such to be the case he would have steered clear of this vicinity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; but I suspect he's still shy, at heart. He {{used to be}} very sentimental, and {{was always}} talking Ruskin. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> hadn't talked Ruskin so much, Jenny Milbury might have treated him better. It was very priggish in him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall assuredly {{say what}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{questions}} me," [...] Beric said quietly; [...] "but if he values me as a guard, he will scarce question {{me when he}} knows that I should express an opinion contrary to his own." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With submission, sir," [...] said he, [...] "yesterday I was {{thinking}} about Bartleby here, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would but prefer to take a quart of good ale every day, it would do much towards mending him, and enabling him to assist in examining his papers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Almost eight o'clock! By Jove, {{that old}} Pat is taking his time, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> Wonder <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has got into trouble?

6000|$|... "I {{have him}} turned out, mamma? God forbid! I'd sooner {{he should be}} here than anywhere, for here he must be out of harm's way; but still <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> comes to a house of mourning, he might, for a short time, submit {{to put up with}} its decent tranquillity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Phoo! phoo!" [...] replied Charles, [...] "what's {{an evening}} party? Never worth remembering. Your father might have {{asked us to}} dinner, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had wanted to see us. You may do as you like, but I shall go to the play." ...|$|E
6000|$|Greythorpe smiled. [...] "That Sedgwick is a dashing and intrepid soldier? Yes. But {{there are}} other points to take into account, and the matter does not entirely rest with me. Still, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> serves us well, we may find some use for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did he?" [...] asked Mary, with pleased surprise, {{anxious to}} believe what the Colonel suggested. [...] "Oh, he must see that I love him! Perhaps he finds me unresponsive.... How could I help caring for him? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> ceased to love me, I should die." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{he should}} take warning, sir, and use {{precautions}} too," [...] interposed Mr. Sweeting; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> would <b>if</b> <b>he</b> heard what I heard the other day." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a bolt out. I didn't {{notice it}} when I drove up," [...] he grumbled. [...] "It's three-eighths by the hole, <b>I</b> <b>think.</b> Ask Bill <b>if</b> <b>he's</b> got {{anything}} of the kind in the stable." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was not {{considerate}} of him," [...] Mr. Bentham agreed--"not at all considerate. Your {{brother had}} {{the command of}} considerable sums of money. In fact, Mr. Barnes, I may tell you, without any breach of confidence, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had kept his appointment {{with me on the}} night when he was murdered, I was prepared, on behalf of my client, to hand him a cheque for ten thousand pounds!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘And I {{can tell}} you he {{is to go to}} no such a place,’ replied the aunt. ‘Hen-house, indeed! If a guest he is to be, he shall sleep in no mortal hen-house. Your room is the most fit, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> will consent to occupy it on so great a suddenty. And as for you, Flora, you shall sleep with me.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't quite {{see what}} age {{has got to}} do with it," [...] he {{answered}} gloomily. [...] "As regards Fothergill, I don't feel particularly sweet on him just now, as you may imagine; but it wasn't his fault at all. I made him go on, and, you know, the winner is a great deal {{in the hands of the}} loser in a case of that sort. He kept on wanting to go and he went at last. I should have gone on playing till now, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> hadn't." ...|$|E
6000|$|Leading the way upstairs, Miss Helena {{apologized for}} taking me into her father's bedroom. [...] "He {{is able to}} sit up in an armchair," [...] she said; [...] "and he might do more, as <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would exert himself. He won't exert himself. Very sad. Would you {{like to look at}} your room, before you see my father? It is quite ready for you. We hope"--she favored me with a {{fascinating}} smile, devoted to winning my heart when her interests required it--"we hope you will pay us a long visit; we look on you as one of ourselves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father, {{let them}} go, {{and let me}} go with them," [...] he said. [...] "You know what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of Sam. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> is in trouble, I want to aid him if it can {{possibly}} be done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! dear, no, ma'am, <b>I</b> rather <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> knew <b>I</b> {{had come}} here, {{he would not}} await my return, for the young gentleman does not seem quite willing to come home. Indeed he is not quite fit; excuse me." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} him deliberately. He was wearing English clothes--a dark tweed suit, ill-cut, and {{apparently}} ready-made; but the foreigner was written large all over him, from the tie of his bow to his narrow patent boots. His eyes were fixed anxiously upon me--large black eyes with long, feminine eyelashes. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had not been under the shelter of my own roof, I must have laid violent hands upon him.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{very kind}} of you," [...] she {{answered}} doubtfully; [...] "but please, no. Somehow, I {{think that it would}} spoil everything if I accepted that sort of help from you. If you have any money of Arthur's, keep it for a time and I think when you write him--I do not want to seem grasping--but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has any to spare you might suggest that he does give me just a little. I have never had anything from him at all. Perhaps he does not quite understand how hard it is for me.|$|E
60|$|It didn't seem worth {{while to}} say {{anything}} more after that. We sat there in stony silence and the time dragged by. I was hot, hungry, thirsty, cross; and besides, I felt that I was in a ridiculous position, which was worse than all the rest. We could see Isaac sitting {{in the shade of}} one of his apple trees in the front orchard comfortably reading a newspaper. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> hadn't aggravated me by doing that I'd have given in sooner. But as it was, I was determined to be as stubborn as everybody else. We were four obstinate creatures--Isaac and Melissa and Julius Caesar and I.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I do,' said she; 'but I {{leave the}} {{development}} to chance. There {{will be a}} scene. I neither invite it nor fear it; only, you must be present, for I am inexpressibly tired of facing him solus. I don't {{like to see him}} in a rage. He then puts off all his fine proprieties and conventional disguises, and the real human being below is what you would call commun, plat, bas--vilain et un peu méchant. His ideas are not clean, Mr. Moore; they want scouring with soft soap and fuller's earth. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could add his imagination to the contents of Mrs. Gill's bucking-basket, and let her boil it in her copper, with rain-water and bleaching-powder (I hope you think me a tolerable laundress), it would do him incalculable good.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, no! That {{would not}} be at all proper. The letter is {{addressed}} to me, Miss Edith Jones. And as it has come from such a very dashing young man, and pays me particular compliments as to my courage, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>I</b> shall let anybody else see it. It doesn't say anything special about beauty, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> uncivil. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> had been writing to you, it would all have been about feminine loveliness of course." ...|$|R
2500|$|To help mankind {{to fight}} violence, he has studied Buddhism and Hinduism {{and is now}} a Roman Catholic priest of the Franciscan Brothers of the Poor. However, Darius {{believes}} more in the spirit than in the letter of dogmas. MacLeod says of him, [...] "I don't think Darius believes in religion or a set of rules, [...] being your brother's keeper. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> Darius, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> has to help mankind, he has to honor their codes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But the {{extraordinary}} mode {{of life of}} this man," [...] said Miss Vere; [...] "his seclusion--his figure--the deepness of mis-anthropy which {{he is said to}} express in his language--Mr. Ratcliffe, what can <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of him <b>if</b> <b>he</b> really possesses the powers you ascribe to him?" ...|$|R
