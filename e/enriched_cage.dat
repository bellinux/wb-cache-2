40|$|We {{tested the}} general {{assumption}} that enrichment {{of the housing}} environment is rewarding to laboratory rats, Rattus norvegicus. We used the behavioural response {{in anticipation of a}} forthcoming reward as a measure of the rewarding property of a simple <b>enriched</b> <b>cage.</b> For this, a Pavlovian conditioning schedule was applied to announce the oncoming transfer to an <b>enriched</b> <b>cage.</b> The response of rats in anticipation of this transfer was compared with that of rats that expected sexual contact, transfer to a standard cage or forced swimming. We also characterized the behavioural profile of the anticipatory response, because until now only general descriptions of this behaviour have been available. The strong increase in activity in anticipation of both an <b>enriched</b> <b>cage</b> and sexual contact and the similar response in terms of the behavioural elements analysed indicate that the appraisal of access to an <b>enriched</b> <b>cage</b> shares a common denominator with the perception of sexual contact. Because sexual contact is generally accepted to have highly rewarding properties to rats, we concluded that the <b>enriched</b> <b>cage</b> is highly rewarding as well. The anticipatory response for sexual contact or an <b>enriched</b> <b>cage</b> was clearly different from the anticipation for access to a standard cage or a forced swim session, indicating that the anticipatory response is related to the positive nature of the stimulus. In general, anticipation appears to be quantifiable by the level of activity measured by the total frequency of behavioural elements displayed. Some behavioural elements, such as exploration, locomotion, arousal and grooming, seem to be more specifically related {{to the nature of the}} forthcoming stimulus.

40|$|Housing {{systems for}} laying hens {{have changed over}} the years due to {{increased}} public concern regarding animal welfare. In terms of sustainability, animal welfare is just one aspect that needs to be considered. Social aspects as well as environmental and economic factors need to be included as well. In this study, we assessed the sustainability of <b>enriched</b> <b>cage,</b> barn, free-range, and organic egg production systems following a predefined protocol. Indicators were selected within the social, environmental, and economic dimensions, after which parameter values and sustainability limits were set for the core indicators in order to quantify sustainability. Uncertainty in the parameter values as well as assigned weights and compensabilities of the indicators influenced the outcome of the sustainability assessment. Using equal weights for the indicators showed that, for the Dutch situation, <b>enriched</b> <b>cage</b> egg production was most sustainable, having the highest score on the environmental dimension, whereas free-range egg production gave the highest score in the social dimension (covering food safety, animal welfare, and human welfare). In the economic dimension both <b>enriched</b> <b>cage</b> egg and organic egg production had the highest sustainability score. When weights were attributed according to stakeholder outputs, individual differences were seen, but the overall scores were comparable to the sustainability scores based on equal weights. The provided method enabled a quantification of sustainability using input from stakeholders to include societal preferences in the overall assessment. Allowing for different weights and compensabilities helps policymakers in communicating with stakeholders involved and provides a weighted decision regarding future housing systems for laying hens...|$|E

40|$|Chronic stress causes {{insensitivity}} to rewards (anhedonia) in rats, {{reflected by}} the absence of anticipatory behavior for a sucrose-reward, which can be reversed by antidepressant treatment or repeated announced transfer to an <b>enriched</b> <b>cage.</b> It was, however, not clear whether the highly rewarding properties of the <b>enriched</b> <b>cage</b> alone caused this reversal or whether the anticipation of this reward as such had an additional effect. Therefore, the present study compared the consequences of the announcement of a reward to the mere effect of a reward alone with respect to their efficacy to counteract the consequences of chronic stress. Two forms of synaptic plasticity, long-term potentiation and long-term depression were investigated in area CA 1 of the hippocampus. This was done in socially stressed rats (induced by defeat and subsequent long-term individual housing), socially stressed rats that received a reward (short-term enriched housing) and socially stressed rats to which this reward was announced by means of a stimulus that was repeatedly paired to the reward. The results were compared to corresponding control rats. We show that announcement of enriched housing appeared to have had an additional effect compared to the enriched housing per se as indicated by a significant higher amount of LTP. In conclusion, announced short-term enriched housing has a high and long-lasting counteracting efficacy on stress-induced alterations of hippocampal synaptic plasticity.

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{move from}} {{conventional}} cages to either an <b>enriched</b> <b>cage</b> or a noncage system {{may affect the}} safety or quality, or both, of the eggs laid by hens raised in this new environment. The safety of the eggs may be altered either microbiologically through contamination of internal contents with Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis (Salmonella Enteritidis) or other pathogens, or both, or chemically due to contamination of internal contents with dioxins, pesticides, or heavy metals. Qual-ity may be affected through changes in {{the integrity of the}} shell, yolk, or albumen along with changes in func-tion, composition, or nutrition. Season, hen breed, flock age, and flock disease-vaccination status also interact to affect egg safety and quality and must be taken into account.

40|$|AbstractConventional ‘battery’ cages for {{laying hens}} without perches, nests and litter {{areas have been}} banned by law {{throughout}} the European Union since 1 January 2012. As an alternative solution, <b>enriched</b> <b>cage</b> systems were introduced. Our aim was to investigate how many applications of litter substrate per day are necessary to motivate laying hens to perform dust bathing behaviour, {{and to what extent}} the hens use these offered litter areas in a species-appropriate manner. Each of the two consecutive experiments was conducted for 12 months, during which 20 (experiment 1) and 40 (experiment 2) laying hens of the strains Lohmann Selected Leghorn (LSL) and Lohmann Brown Classic (LB) were housed in 10 units of the <b>enriched</b> <b>cage</b> system HÜK 125 / 80 (2 hens/unit [(experiment 1], 4 hens/unit [experiment 2], same strain per unit). In defined daily application frequencies from one to four times (11 : 00 a. m., 1 : 00 p. m., 3 : 00 p. m. and 5 : 00 p. m.) over the laying period, 50 g conventional feed per application were applied as litter substrate onto each 925 cm 2 sized mat. The hens were recorded weekly by digital video systems. Results showed that the mean duration of dust bathing behaviour lasted 05 : 58 min in experiment 1 and 04 : 59 min in experiment 2. Litter application frequency had a significant effect on the dust bathing duration as well in experiment 1 (P< 0. 05) as experiment 2 (P< 0. 01). For both experiments the number of dust baths increased with the maximum number of litter applications per day and this linear trend is significant for experiment 2 (P< 0. 001). A high percentage of interrupted and early terminated dust bathing bouts were observed, mostly induced by a conspecific. The mean interruption duration was 00 : 18 min for experiment 1 and 00 : 45 min for experiment 2. The daily litter application frequency had no significant effect on the duration of interruptions for neither experiment but on the number of interruptions. According to the results of this study, litter applications at least twice a day can be recommended, and sufficiently sized dust bathing mats should be offered to laying hens housed in cage systems.

The Department of Agricultural Science and Environment, University of Udine, in the frame of a research project co-financed by the Ministry of University and Research, carried out several experimental trials in alternative houses with deep-litter system in order to assess the environmental impact.

40|$|Laying hen housing systems {{must provide}} feed, water, light, air quality, space and {{sanitation}} that promote {{good health and}} welfare for the hens. Housing systems should provide for expression of important natural behaviors, protect the hens from disease, injury and predation, and promote food safety. Cages for laying hens were developed in the United States during the 1920 s and 30 s to reduce disease, (e. g., coccidiosis and roundworms) and injuries due to pecking. In addition, the conventional cage simplified husbandry by increasing efficiency and required less real estate.

This study was conducted to compare indices of production and welfare in birds housed in 2 different caging systems. Shaver White hens were housed from 21 to 61 wk in either conventional battery cages (n = 500; 10 cages; 5 hens/cage; floor space = 561. 9 cm(2) /hen) or <b>enriched</b> <b>cages</b> (n = 480; 2 cages; 24 hens/cage; floor space = 642. 6 cm(2) /hen) and were replicated 10 times. <b>Enriched</b> <b>cages</b> provided hens with a curtained nesting area, scratch pad, and perches. Production parameters and egg quality measures were recorded throughout the experiment. Plumage condition was evaluated at 37 and 61 wk. Bone quality traits and immunological response parameters were measured at 61 wk, and 59 and 61 wk, respectively. Hen-day egg production, feed consumption, egg weight, and percentage of cumulative mortality of laying hens were not affected by the cage designs. Specific gravity and the percentage of cracked and soft-shelled eggs were also similar between the 2 housing systems. The incidence of dirty eggs was, however, significantly higher (P < 0. 0001) in <b>enriched</b> <b>cages</b> than in conventional cages.

This study compared the laying hen welfare, based on the 5 animal freedoms, in the following housing systems: conventional cage, <b>enriched</b> <b>cage,</b> barn, free-range and organic. These housing systems each represent a different EU-egg code, which should represent a certain level of welfare for the consumer (in which conventional cage hens have the worst and organic hens the best welfare). Literature review showed that each system had its pros and cons. Natural behaviour was impaired in the conventional cage system, but cage-hens had less diseases and bone-fractures.

In addition, rats housed in Marlau™ cages exhibited better performances in learning and memory, decreased anxiety-associated behaviors, and better recovery of basal plasma corticosterone level after acute restraint stress. Marlau™ cages also insure inter-experiment reproducibility in spatial learning and brain gene expression assays. Finally, housing rats in Marlau™ cages after severe status epilepticus at weaning prevents the cognitive impairment observed in rats subjected to the same insult and then housed in conventional cages.

40|$|Environmental enrichment, {{defined as}} housing {{conditions}} {{that include a}} combination of complex inanimate and social stimulation, has strong positive effects on brain and behaviour in various species. We extended previous studies to evaluate how enrichment affects mating success. In a series of experiments, we found that male fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster, reared in an enriched environment were twice as successful in acquiring mates as were males from standard rearing conditions. The dominant factor increasing mating success was the larger space available per fly. Flies from enriched and standard environments showed no significant behavioural differences, leading us to suggest that different social environments at high and low per capita spaces are associated, on average, with either subtle behavioural differences or distinct pheromonal profiles to which females are sensitive while choosing mates. © 2003 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour.

Environmental enrichment refers to laboratory housing conditions that include a combination of complex inanimate and social stimulation (van Praag et al. 2000).

The fur quality differed between groups with the poorest quality in the group of four animals housed in an <b>enriched</b> <b>cage.</b> No general difference between males and females was found. No difference between groups was found in the distribution of the pelts into the size categories. The size category and the quality of the fur were the main factors determining the selling price of the pelt. The selling price was higher in pelts of males than in those of females. This difference between males and females appeared only in the Finnraccoons housed in pairs, and not in those housed in groups. When only the auction where the majority of pelts were sold was considered, the selling price of the pelt was higher in females when housed in larger cages instead of small cages and in enriched cages instead of barren cages. In conclusion, the larger cage size and increased complexity of the cage may increase the selling price of pelts in juvenile Finnraccoons, especially in females. Although, the increased cage complexity impairs the quality of the fur, this does not finally affect the selling price of the pelt...|$|E
40|$|As {{part of a}} {{systemic}} assessment toward social sustainability of egg production, we have reviewed current knowledge about {{the environmental impacts of}} egg production systems and identified topics requiring further research. Currently, we know that 1) high-rise cage houses generally have poorer air quality and emit more ammonia than manure belt (MB) cage houses; 2) manure removal frequency in MB houses greatly affects ammonia emissions; 3) emissions from manure storage are largely affected by storage conditions, including ventilation rate, manure moisture content, air temperature, and stacking profile; 4) more baseline data on air emissions from high-rise and MB houses are being collected in the United States to complement earlier measurements; 5) noncage houses generally have poorer air quality (ammonia and dust levels) than cage houses; 6) noncage houses tend to be colder during cold weather due to a lower stocking density than caged houses, leading to greater feed and fuel energy use; 7) hens in noncage houses are less efficient in resource (feed, energy, and land) utilization, leading to a greater carbon footprint; 8) excessive application of hen manure to cropland can lead to nutrient runoff to water bodies; 9) hen manure on open (free) range may be subject to runoff during rainfall, although quantitative data are lacking; 10) mitigation technologies exist to reduce generation and emission of noxious gases and dust; however, work is needed to evaluate their economic feasibility and optimize design; and 11) dietary modification shows promise for mitigating emissions. Further research is needed on 1) indoor air quality, barn emissions, thermal conditions, and energy use in alternative hen housing systems (1 -story floor, aviary, and <b>enriched</b> <b>cage</b> systems), along with conventional housing systems under different production conditions; 2) environmental footprint for different US egg production systems through life cycle assessment; 3) practical means to mitigate air emissions from different production systems; 4) process-based models for predicting air emissions and their fate; and 5) the interactions between air quality, housing system, worker health, and animal health and welfare...|$|E
40|$|Maternal {{behaviour}} {{is crucial}} {{for the development of}} the rat pups’ behaviour and stress responses later in life. There are numerous studies evaluating the effects of the dams’ behaviours on the pups, but not many addressing what can be made for wellbeing of the rat dams when breeding. Few studies have addressed the question of how the commonly used rearing environment effects the dams’ behaviour and in the long run how it effect the rats reared to become our research models. In this study, rats were therefore reared in two different cage systems; one cage type with elevated top and enriched by a shelf and climbable netting (RT) was compared to the type of cage most commonly used today, the makrolon type IV cage (M IV). Dams were equipped with telemetrical devices to measure activity, blood pressure and heart rate, and direct observations of their maternal behaviour were made. Urine corticosterone/creatinine quote was measured and behavioural tests (defensive withdrawal test, elevated plus maze test and open field with novel object) were performed in both dams and pups. The dams in the RT cages showed more activity and a transient increase in blood pressure, and a tendency towards less urine corticosterone levels. They also spent less time licking/grooming and arched back nursing their young. The pups showed differences in urine corticosterone levels as well as in the behavioural tests, where the RT pups had significantly less corticosterone excretion, and showed less fearful and anxiety-like behaviours in the behavioural tests. There were greater differences between the groups of female pups than between the male ones, pointing to the female pups being more sensitive to improvements of the environment. We have shown that the rat dams’ activity increases and stress decreases in the RT <b>enriched</b> <b>cage,</b> and that the rat pups from the RT cages show less stress response, less fearful and less anxiety-like behaviours even though the dams spend less time licking/grooming and arched back nursing them. These findings support the argument that an enriched optimised environment and voluntary maternal separation give mentally healthier rats, possibly better as a model for mentally healthy humans...|$|E
40|$|When kept in barren and {{restrictive}} cages, animals frequently develop stereotypic behaviour {{patterns that}} {{are characterized by}} high repetition rates, conspicuous invariance and an apparent lack of function. Although millions of animals are affected, the underlying causes and mechanisms are still unclear. Growing evidence suggests that cage-induced stereotypies may reflect pathological dysfunction within basal ganglia circuitry expressed by perseverative behaviour. In order to assess whether variation in stereotypy performance and variation in perseverative behaviour may have a common cause in ICR CD- 1 mice, we assessed the effects of environmental enrichment on both phenomena. We raised 48 female ICR CD- 1 mice in standard or <b>enriched</b> <b>cages</b> from three weeks to either 6 or 11 months of age and measured stereotypy level in the home cage and perseveration on an extinction task. We further examined whether enriched rearing conditions (early enrichment) protect mice from the developing stereotypies later in life and whether stereotypies developed in barren cages would persist in an enriched environment (late enrichment) by transferring standard mice to <b>enriched</b> <b>cages</b> and vice versa for 14 weeks after completion of the extinction task. We found no evidence for a causal relation between stereotypy and perseveration in mice. However, transfer to <b>enriched</b> <b>cages</b> reduced stereotypy levels significantly both at 6 and 11 months of age indicating that stereotypies had not become established yet. Finally, we found that removing enrichments at both ages did not induce higher stereotypy levels, thereby confirming earlier reports of a neuroprotective effect of early enrichment...|$|R

40|$|The Author(s) 2016. Proposition 2, which {{requires}} that egg-laying hens be confined only {{in ways that}} allow these animals to lie down, stand up, fully extend their limbs and turn around freely, {{was passed by the}} voters of California in 2008. These new housing requirements were introduced in the USA and European Union without considering the potential impact of changes in layer hen housing on the health of poultry workers in the new facilities. Particles were collected from ambient air inside a large layer hen complex featuring separate barns with conventional battery <b>caging,</b> <b>enriched</b> <b>caging,</b> or 'free range' (aviary) housing during winter, spring, and summer seasons over one year. Toxicity of the particles was evaluated by analysis of inflammatory cell influx into lung lavage fluid after intratracheal instillation into mice. Capacity of the particles to elicit oxidative stress was evaluated using a macrophage cell line engineered with a reporter gene sensitive to nuclear factor kB activation. We observed similar pro-inflammatory and pro-oxidant effects of the particles collected from different types of barns and over different seasons, suggesting that standard industrial hygiene techniques for evaluating respirable particles in ambient air can adequately monitor worker risk. Based on particle concentrations found in ambient air in the barns, we can rank the facilities for worker exposure to particles as conventional caging (now banned) approximately equal to <b>enriched</b> <b>caging</b> (permitted under Proposition 2). Aviary housing is associated with increased exposure of workers to particulate matter and, therefore, to greater risk of allergic reactions and/or decreased respiratory function...|$|R
