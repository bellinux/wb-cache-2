5000|$|This was on {{the grounds}} above the Braunschweig East station (Ostbahnhof, also called St. Leonhard station, {{marshalling}} yard or freight yard). [...] The <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks</b> for the future station began {{as early as the}} 1930s. The final location was a compromise, with the cost and area to be demolished to be kept as low as possible.|$|R
50|$|Visual {{operation}} (OZ) utilizes electro-optical {{sights on}} the gun mounts, this allows the <b>direct</b> <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> the guns by their crews; this mode of operation limits the system to daylight/good weather conditions. Radar target assignment (ZZR) requires an oral radio or telephone transmission to the Parallaxcomputer operator, who inputs the search data into the device. Under the control of this analog computer the fire-control radar tracks the target, the computer continuously calculates a firing solution, and lays and fires the guns by remote control.|$|R
50|$|Verner {{is located}} on the Veuve River (Rivière Veuve), at the western {{junction}} of highways 17 and 64, approximately 16 km west of Sturgeon Falls. The largely francophone community serves as an agricultural hub for the surrounding area and offers a consumers' cooperative and farm equipment dealers. The town was named for the wife of Canadian Pacific Railway superintendent Archer Baker, who oversaw the <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> <b>track</b> through the West Nipissing area in the 1880s.|$|R
5000|$|From Sunday 8 January 2017, {{vehicular}} {{access to}} the railway station changed, with access now via Corn Hill. This change coincided {{with the opening of}} the extended car park.

[...] The railroad was completed, to great fanfare, in 1873; and the wooden bridge and sand road was finally replaced by a formal roadway in 1877. The railroad terminated at Railroad Wharf, known today as MacMillan Pier. It provided an easy means for fishermen to offload their vessels and ship their catch to the cities by rail.|$|R
2500|$|Coal miners {{increasingly}} agitated {{for improved}} wages {{and working conditions}} after 1900. Miners demanded an eight-hour day and wages equal to those paid in the nearby Pittsburgh coal basin. Since miners were paid by the ton, workers also wanted to standardize the size of coal wagons to ensure they were paid fairly. Miners also sought {{to be paid for}} mining [...] "slack" [...] (very fine coal), and for [...] "dead work" [...] (<b>laying</b> <b>of</b> <b>track,</b> shoring up tunnels, pumping out water, and removing slate and clay).|$|R
5000|$|The work of {{building}} the first railway line in Uruguay began on April 25, 1867, with the openning of a branch between Paso del Molino and Cerro which consisted of a horse-drawn train. The national [...] "Ferrocarril Central" [...] had obtained the concession for the <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks</b> to Durazno, 205 km from Montevideo. However, {{for more than a}} decade they had submitted projects to no avail. The first 18 km branch between Bella Vista and Las Piedras, was inaugurated on 1 January 1869.|$|R

500|$|Construction on the line's second part, from Levanger to Sunnan, {{started in}} 1901. Part {{of the reason}} for the early start was to help employ older navvies who were working on the {{southern}} section during the summer. By early 1904, the right-of-way to Fleskhus was completed and the <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks</b> could begin. The bridge over Verdalselva was built using [...] of stone, which had to be transported [...] from Bagloåsen in Levanger. The superstructure was built by Vulkan of Oslo and was installed between 9 September and 27 November 1903.|$|R
50|$|Spreading car {{ownership}} {{led to a}} rapid {{decline of}} passenger traffic in Devon and Cornwall from about 1960 {{to the end of}} that decade so short mid-distance-from-London branches and the remote peninsular sections of route closed under the Beeching Report, except the line to Penzance from Exeter which had since the very outset been the main preserve of the Great Western Railway, chiefly due to that company's initial <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> <b>track</b> there and doing so on broad gauge and encouraging Devon and Cornish companies to do so under the 'Gauge War'.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> <b>tracks</b> borders {{along the}} Iguazu River and runs at speeds {{of no more}} than 20 {{kilometres}} per hour (12 mph) and stops when animals cross the railway lines, the journey takes about 20 minutes, with a [...] "stop" [...] at the Cataratas (Waterfalls) Station and then to the terminus Garganta del Diablo (Devil's Gorge) Station. Here you can go down and access the foot bridge, which goes to the balcony built {{on the edge of the}} huge waterfall 90 metres high called Garganta del Diablo.|$|R
2500|$|Even the D {{model was}} not {{accurate}} enough for <b>direct</b> <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> guns. In {{order to provide}} the system with much greater accuracy, the FuMG 65 Würzburg-Riese ("Giant Würzburg") was developed. Based on the same circuitry as the D model, the new version featured a much larger [...] antenna and a more powerful transmitter {{with a range of}} up to [...] Azimuth and elevation accuracy was 0.1-0.2degrees, which was more than enough for direct gun-laying. The system was too large to be carried on a truck trailer and was adapted for operation from a railway carriage as the Würzburg-Riese-E, of which 1,500 were produced during the war. The Würzburg-Riese Gigant was a very large version with a 160kW transmitter, which never entered production.|$|R
50|$|The <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> {{a second}} <b>track</b> on the {{original}} section between Staffel and Limburg was completed on 10 December 1888.|$|R
25|$|The {{work was}} carried out {{primarily}} by the Ministry of Works, who {{were responsible for the}} drilling of the tunnel. Various other related jobs were handled by private contractors, including the tunnel approaches and the <b>laying</b> <b>of</b> the <b>track</b> bed in the tunnel.|$|R

[...] As of 2017, about 4.25 mi of rail, in three unconnected sections (described in the table below), has been laid between Port Morris and Lake Lackawanna. Most of the right-of-way between Port Morris Junction and the lake has been cleared of trees and debris. Currently, a short section from Port Morris Junction on the Cut-Off is being used by NJ Transit for storage of retired rail locomotives.|$|R
