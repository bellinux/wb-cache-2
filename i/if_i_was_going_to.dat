5|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Robert Canning of IGN about how she felt about being asked to come on to Angel after previously being killed off, Benz commented: I was shocked. I just thought once you poof'd, you poof'd! I thought that was it. So when they threw it out to me that I was coming back... They didn't tell me they were bringing her back to life. They just sent me the script for the season finale for season one of Angel, when they rose me from the dead. I was reading the script, and half way through, Darla still hadn't shown up. Benz went on to add, I was like, 'Alright...' I get three quarters of the way through and I think, 'Maybe they sent me the wrong script...?' And then I get to the last page, and I was like, 'Oh my god! I can't believe this! This is so cool!' At that time I'd been committed to another project too. We didn't even know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be available or not. But it all ended up working out.|$|E
25|$|I {{think in}} casual {{conversation}} I {{would have told}} anybody I wanted to direct. At the same time I knew Hollywood was a closed off place... It was much harder to get in. To be an older director was a very positive thing. It meant you had survived, knew your way, could make things and make them meet your economic responsibilities. It was always paramount in studio minds, especially in those days... <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> direct I was going to write my way in. No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E
500|$|Gillard's {{mother told}} ABC TV's Australian Story program that Gillard had spoken {{from a young}} age of never wanting children. Gillard herself told the program that while she admired women who could balance child rearing with a career, [...] "I'm not sure I could have. There's {{something}} in me that's focused and single-minded and <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do that, I'm not sure I could have done this." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Love the Way You Lie" [...] and [...] "Love the Way You Lie (Part II)" [...] {{were based}} on a demo written and {{recorded}} in late 2009 by Grey. Grey told PopEater [...] "I wrote the demo initially for myself because I thought, ‘Oh, I have this big song, and now I {{have a little bit of}} a launching pad to put out my own stuff." [...] Grey continued to discuss how the song was ultimately included on Loud, saying [...] "As soon as Rihanna and her team heard my demo, they were like, ‘Oh we want it for Rihanna’s album,’ so I had to make the decision <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let them have it or not. But I did and so it was on Rihanna’s album, too." [...] The demo track by Grey is on her extended play The Buried Sessions of Skylar Grey, which was released on January 17, 2012.|$|E
500|$|I was hit [...] by flak as I {{was pulling}} out of a dive-strafing pass on an {{airfield}} called Tarnewitz, up on the Baltic. Five P-51s made a pass on the airdrome that April day. I {{was the only one}} to return home...When I tested the stall characteristics of my wounded bird over our home airfield, I found it quit flying at a little over [...] indicated and rolled violently into the dead wing (note: the right flap had been blown away and two large holes knocked in the same wing). What to do? Bailout seemed the logical response, but here's where sentiment {{got in the way of}} reason. That airplane (note: [...] "Scat VI") had taken me through a lot and I was damned <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> give up on her...why the bird and I survived the careening, bouncing and juttering ride down the length of the field, I guess I'll never know.|$|E
500|$|In December 1978, Genesis began {{a period}} of {{inactivity}} as Collins's marriage was at risk of collapse after touring had made him frequently absent from his wife and children. Following a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and Smith, Collins went to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada to try and rebuild the family. He explained: [...] "I {{was never going to}} leave the band. It was just that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be living in Vancouver then we'd have had to organise ourselves differently." [...] Banks and Rutherford decided to put Genesis on an extended break and make their respective debut solo albums, A Curious Feeling and Smallcreep's Day, at Polar Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. In April 1979, Collins returned to the UK after his attempt to save his marriage failed. With time to spare before working on a new Genesis album, Collins performed with Brand X and started writing his first solo album, Face Value, at his home in Shalford, Surrey.|$|E

But listen. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> arrested on a charge of {{abduction}} and manslaughter, as seems exceedingly probable, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not <b>going</b> to leave my job half done. An English jury may call it murder <b>if</b> <b>I</b> shoot you two as you sit. I'll risk that. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to get into trouble for one of you, I'll make sure of the lot." ...|$|R

500|$|The group's touring {{schedule}} had put particular {{pressure on}} Collins, whose marriage was {{at risk of}} collapse due to him being away from home frequently. His wife, Andrea, had warned {{him that if he}} committed himself to the full ...And Then There Were Three... Tour, she would not be there when he returned. Collins, however, was convinced that Genesis {{were on the verge of}} an international breakthrough and that his work with the band would pay dividends in the future. By the end of 1978, Andrea had decided to move to Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with their children. Realising that his marriage was more important than the band, Collins held a meeting with Banks, Rutherford and manager Tony Smith. He said he was moving to Vancouver and try and re-build the family, and that the group would have to accommodate this. In an interview for Sounds, Collins said, [...] "I went off for two months to try and sort things out ... I was never going to leave the band. It was just that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be living in Vancouver then we'd have had to organise ourselves differently." [...] He also noted that the individual members of his side project Brand X were geographically dispersed.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} {{originally}} drew {{her to the}} role of Terri in an interview with TheTVChick, Gilsig said: [...] "Well, first of all, Ryan Murphy. Because I had worked with him on Nip/Tuck. And {{that was one of the}} best experiences as an actor I’ve ever had in my career. He really challenges you as an actor, and he really pushes you, and he really puts a lot of faith in actors to be able to — I think go further than they’ve ever gone before. Certainly for me on Nip/Tuck. You know, for obvious reasons…things I never thought I’d do. (laughs) But also just emotionally and character-wise and comedically. Every script was just this amazing emotional gymnastics. So that first of all: I was like great, I’d love to work with Ryan. And for me, the opportunity to do a comedy is something that I’ve been itching to do for many years now and also <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do that–which is kind of a big risk for me–to be able to do that with Ryan, who I know so well, and then so much of the crew that I was familiar with from Nip/Tuck was kind of a dream scenario I would say." ...|$|E
500|$|Following her {{departure}} from Hole in November 1999, Melissa Auf der Maur was recruited as the replacement bassist for D'arcy Wretzky in The Smashing Pumpkins in early 2000. Auf der Maur toured {{with the band}} for the Sacred and Profane tour in support of Machina/The Machines of God (2000) and appeared in the music videos accompanying its release. In May 2000, The Smashing Pumpkins disbanded and Auf der Maur did not have plans to continue her music career. In an interview with Jam!, Auf der Maur said: [...] "one {{of the reasons why}} I took 2001 off is I didn't even know what I was going to do with music. Maybe I was going to play in a cover band the rest of my life" [...] and that her [...] "relationship to music had become very army-oriented. I was a soldier, a hard worker who never got enough satisfaction from the music. I didn't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make my own record." [...] In late 2001, Auf der Maur discovered [...] "old demos" [...] in her Montréal residence and [...] "realized [...] had an entire album's worth of material that had been sitting there for years." [...] Among the demos was [...] "Real a Lie", a song written with frequent collaborator Steve Durand, that was released as a single by the duo's former band Tinker in 1994. Auf der Maur said that the decision to record an album [...] "happened very naturally." ...|$|E

6000|$|... [Briskly.] Well, at {{all events}} that's some comfort. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to <b>be</b> done {{out of my}} night's rest, I should like {{to take it out}} of some one.|$|R
500|$|Friends was Aniston's sixth sitcom; {{each of her}} {{previous}} ventures had been canceled prematurely. Feeling vulnerable, Aniston had begun to doubt herself as an actress and personally approached Littlefield for reassurance on her career, who encouraged her to audition for Friends, which was being referred to as Friends Like These at the time. Crane and Kauffman had worked with Aniston prior to this. However, casting her as Rachel posed a challenge for the network because, at the time, Aniston was simultaneously starring in a developing CBS sitcom called Muddling Through, in which she plays a young woman whose mother is returning home from jail after two years. CBS was initially reluctant to release Aniston from her contract, which required the actress to balance both roles simultaneously, traveling back-and-forth between Muddling Through and Friends for two weeks. Meanwhile, NBC risked having to recast the role of Rachel, replace Aniston, and reshoot several episodes if CBS' series proved successful, which would have potentially cost the network millions of dollars. However, Littlefield remained confident that Muddling Through would fail. Essentially, the producers of Friends hoped that Muddling Through would be canceled before Friends premiered, while Aniston feared that Muddling Through would be the more successful of the two sitcoms {{in spite of her}} preference towards Friends. During this time of uncertainty, Aniston was forced not to participate in several Friends-related promotions and photo shoots; the network excluded her from these in case she would be replaced. Aniston explained, [...] "When we were shooting the first grouping of cast photos ... I was asked to step out of a bunch because they didn't know <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be still playing Rachel." [...] Director James Burrows admitted that Aniston had been cast in second position. The producers had already begun auditioning other actresses for the part, while Aniston also received phone calls from her own friends warning her, [...] "I'm auditioning for your part in Friends." [...] Ultimately, Muddling Through was canceled after only three months and ten episodes, two weeks before the pilot of Friends aired, thus allowing Aniston to keep her role on the show, becoming its second youngest cast member at the age of 25. Crane appreciated Aniston's interpretation of Rachel because [...] "in the wrong hands Rachel is kind of annoying and spoiled and unlikable," [...] commending the actress for [...] "breathing life into a difficult character." ...|$|E

2500|$|On October 31, 2008, Ellison's {{mother died}} of {{complications}} from diabetes, twenty-one months after his great-aunt Alice Coltrane's death. Ellison said, [...] "I decided that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> speak after that experience , it better be something honest, and deeper than a record that was just made for the times. I {{wanted to do something}} that made her proud." ...|$|E

2500|$|... about {{claiming}} the passionate aspect of womanhood {{that the church}} teaches is wrong, [...] "the idea of speaking my truth, no censorship, {{in a place that}} did not honor anyone's truth unless it was the church's truth," [...] "so I figured <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> claim my womanhood, my passion, and sing this record - which, for me, was claiming fragments that I had suppressed for a long time - then I was {{going to go back to}} a church, back to the old world, to do it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Orr {{conceived}} {{the idea of}} writing a cookbook in December 1985, the one month after his wife's election. He had begun cooking, which he described [...] "as my secret passion," [...] after his wife entered politics, likening the recipes he found to the [...] "Dead Sea Scrolls." [...] In an interview Orr noted, [...] "Recipes were like the Dead Sea Scrolls...Kay's a great cook, but I realized with her involvement in politics that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have home cooking, I {{was going to have}} to do it myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beck's {{previous}} album, Modern Guilt, {{was released}} in 2008, and was the final album released under his Interscope Records contract. In the interim between album releases, Beck worked {{on a wide variety}} of projects, including new studio material, most of which went unreleased for several years. In October 2012, bassist and frequent collaborator Justin Meldal-Johnsen commented: [...] "I would estimate that there are currently about three or four albums’ worth of material floating around," [...] and Beck himself said that [...] "I wasn't sure <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> put out a record – or if I should put out a record. It felt like I was standing still, while everything else was in such flux." ...|$|E

2500|$|After having earned {{only one}} win {{in her last}} seven starts, Winx was dropped in class for the Group 3 Sunshine Coast Guineas on 16 May. She trailed the large field as they turned for home but finally found racing room and drew off to win by one and three quarter lengths from the colt Ulmann. [...] "At the 1000m I thought 'This is not good.' At the 600m it was even worse. I was in an {{impossible}} position," [...] said jockey Larry Cassidy. [...] "I just {{made the decision to}} come to the outside. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get beat, I didn't want it to be because I was on the inside behind horses.

2500|$|That same day, Wurzelbacher also {{appeared}} on Good Morning America. Diane Sawyer {{asked him if}} he was taking home $250,000 now, Wurzelbacher said with a laugh [...] "No, not even close." [...] Sawyer asked Wurzelbacher, [...] "And the McCain camp, some people have said did they contact you and tell you {{that you were going to}} be a major part of this, and had they contacted you before that encounter with Senator Obama?" [...] Wurzelbacher answered, [...] "Oh no, no, no one's contacted me as far as <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be on the debate or as far as my name being used. No. I have been contacted by them and asked to show up at a rally. But, other than that, no. I just happened to be here and Barack Obama happened to show up." ...|$|E
2500|$|While Gardiner {{was only}} {{allowed to vote}} in Metro Council to break ties, he was a voting member of all four policy {{committees}}. The committees would do the early work of working through proposals preparing them for Council. Gardiner prided himself on his work ethic, the same style he had used since his days at high school. [...] "I {{was not going to}} change my way of proceeding. It was more necessary than ever. My diagnosis was that <b>if</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get anywhere I had to know more about any given subject than any individual councillor, and more about metropolitan business as than all the members of council combined." [...] Gardiner would wait to speak on important resolutions after others had spoken. When a close vote was anticipated, Gardiner went around the council table, rebutting objections one by one.|$|E
