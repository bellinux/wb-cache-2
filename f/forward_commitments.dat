The model provides a link between no-arbitrage models and expectation oriented models. It highlights the role of inventories for the identification of different pricing regimes. In an empirical study the hedging performance of our model is compared with five other one- and two-factor pricing models.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the role of}} <b>forward</b> <b>commitments</b> and option contracts between a seller (supplier) and a buyer (retailer) {{in the presence of}} asymmetric information. In our case, both parties face price and demand uncertainty but the retailer, being closer to the market, has additional information about the true demand and price. The supplier, aware of this asymmetry, and acting as a Stackelberg leader, designs a contracting arrangement that best meet his interest. We contrast the role of forward and option contracts in this environment and identify cases where combinations of the two are dominant. Finally, we investigate how alternative contracting arrangements alter the expected value of obtaining information that eliminates asymmetric information. Supply chain management Gaming...|$|E

If convergence does not occur, it raises fundamental questions related to the sustainability of heterogeneous competitive strategies. This paper examines the prices submitted to the British wholesale electricity market by four coal-fired plants, separately owned, approximately of the same age, size and efficiency, and located in the same transmission network zone. Due to the repetitive nature of the spot market, one would expect convergence in strategies. Yet, we find evidence of persistent price dispersion and heterogeneous strategies. We consider several propositions for these effects including market power, company size, <b>forward</b> <b>commitments,</b> vertical integration and the management of interrelated assets...|$|E

The workshop is described below, along with some of what we learned. Participants were asked to decide whether they wanted to purchase CRC multi-peril crop insurance and how much corn they wanted to cash forward contract from early April to late July for harvest-time delivery. For workshops in predominately irrigated areas, participants were given past corn yields for a 500 -acre farm with a 10 - year average yield of 165 bushels per acre based on actual yields from a University of Nebraska farm near Clay Center. Corn production that wasn 2 ̆ 7 t forward priced would be sold at harvest and any shortfall of contracted production would have to be purchased at 5 cents above the harvest cash price. Cash forward prices were announced to participants two weeks at a time up to the end of July. Cash <b>forward</b> <b>commitments</b> were collected before the next price was announced.

40|$|This book explores Australia’s {{prospective}} cyber-warfare {{requirements and}} challenges. It describes {{the current state}} of planning and thinking within the Australian Defence Force with respect to Network Centric Warfare, and discusses the vulnerabilities that accompany the use by Defence of the National Information Infrastructure (NII), as well as Defence’s responsibility {{for the protection of the}} NII. It notes the multitude of agencies concerned in various ways with information security, and argues that mechanisms are required to enhance coordination between them. It also argues that Australia has been laggard with respect to the development of offensive cyber-warfare plans and capabilities. Finally, it proposes the establishment of an Australian Cyber-warfare Centre responsible for the planning and conduct of both the defensive and offensive dimensions of cyber-warfare, for developing doctrine and operational concepts, and for identifying new capability requirements. It argues that the matter is urgent in order to ensure that Australia will have the necessary capabilities for conducting technically and strategically sophisticated cyber-warfare activities by the 2020 s. The Foreword has been contributed by Professor Kim C. Beazley, former Minister for Defence (1984 – 90), who describes it as ‘a timely book which transcends old debates on priorities for the defence of Australia or <b>forward</b> <b>commitments,</b> [and] debates about globalism and regionalism’, and as ‘an invaluable compendium’ to the current process of refining the strategic guidance for Australia’s future defence policies and capabilities...|$|E
40|$|The {{focus of}} this case is a Canadian company with mostly US dollar sales and Canadian dollar costs {{operating}} in a flexible exchange rate environment. It is also undergoing a major expansion of its facilities. The operating and foreign exchange risk induce the firm to sell forward almost US$ 1 billion in order to hedge anticipated US revenues. The company also engages in extensive US dollar debt financing. Subsequently, Great Lakes' revenues are affected by both price effects and very large volume effects that effectively both reverse its exposure and call into question {{whether or not there}} would be sufficient foreign revenues to fulfil the contracted forward sales of foreign currency. The pedagogic value of the case is to lead the student through the critical issues involved in ‘hedge’ accounting. The company actually deferred all gains and losses on its medium-term forward contracts, even though its revenue decline called into question its ability to meet its <b>forward</b> <b>commitments</b> from actual sales. The student is thus brought {{face to face with the}} critical question of ‘when is a hedge a hedge?’, and 'when should hedge accounting be used?' The case also includes enough material on the company and the hedging instruments to enable the student to understand the business situation that generates the accounting problems. The case is appropriate for any instructor who wishes to bring out the issues involved in hedge accounting. For Great Lakes, hedge accounting was the most important accounting principle, so the underlying issues are easy to motivate. However, the issues are broader than the actual case context; they are important for any firm where hedging instruments are available to manage the price exposure in its revenues. For example, the case can also be used to discuss a gas or oil produced who hedges price risk by selling oil and gas futures. The critical accounting issues is the definition and treatment of a hedge. Foreign exchange risk, hedge accounting, financial risk management, exposure management, revenue hedge,...|$|E

40|$|The authors {{show that}} the {{potential}} benefit to a host country of forward markets or of foreign exchange guarantees depend on the investor's country of origin and on specific characteristics of investment. They show {{this in terms of}} the effects on foreign-exchange risks and on the amount of foreign direct investment taking place. Their main lessons for foreign investors: (a) the benefits of hedging exchange risks through forward markets vary substantially, depending on the investor, the type of investment, and, for foreign direct investment (FDI), the direction of the market supplied; (b) for short lived investment or FDI targeted to the host country market, the potential for gain from forward contracts is substantial because in the short run, nominal exchange rate fluctuations tend to be larger than real exchange rate fluctuations; (c) for long-lived investments or export oriented FDI, the gains from forward contracts will be much smaller. Firms investing in long lived assets or in activities targeted to exports net natural insurance from the correlation between the nominal exchange rate and the firm's earnings in host-country currency; and (d) the evidence on exchange rate and price fluctuations between 1975 and 1991 suggests that the demand for coverage is likely to be stronger in South Asia than in Latin America. In East Asia, the evidence is mixed. Their main lessons for host country governments: (a) in the short run, if there are no private forward markets, the optimal policy for a risk-neutral host country is to provide the firm with forward contracts at the expected spot exchange rate. This government insurance has the same effects as allowing trading in forward markets. But these contracts can have fiscal consequences, as they did in Latin America; (b) forward markets do not discriminate against host country firms. Those engaged in international trade can also benefit from the presence of forward markets; and (c) in the medium run, as exchange controls are being liberalized, forward markets may be slow to develop because of participants'uncertainty about their ability to get foreign currency to cover <b>forward</b> <b>commitments.</b> In this transitional period, contracts offered by the government are likely to be the most efficient means of reassuring foreign investors. These contracts should also be make available to host-country firms during the transitional period, in order not to discriminate against domestic investors.
