Methods. Fifty-one patients with chronic apical periodontitis were randomly allocated {{in one of the}} following groups according to the <b>intracanal</b> medicament used: CH, CH-GP and CHX-GP group. Bacterial samples were taken upon access (S 1), after chemomechanical instrumentation (S 2) and after 15 -day medication (S 3). PCR assay was used to detect the presence of selected bacteria. Results. E. faecalis was detected in 49 % (25 / 51) and P. gingivalis in 17. 6 % (9 / 51) of the samples. Samples which showed no bacterial presence at S 1 were excluded from further analysis. Overall analysis of all 29 samples revealed significant differences between S 1 and S 2 (p< 0. 001), S 2 and S 3 (p< 0. 05), and S 1 and S 3 (p< 0. 001).

It may be implicated that the <b>intracanal</b> medicaments used for pulp therapy may be the probable etiologic factor for the occurrence of these cysts as has been enumerated in the literature. This does not implicate that <b>intracanal</b> medicaments should not be used, but it is prudent to imply that pulpotomy treated primary molars should receive periodic postoperative radiographic examination and absence of clinical symptoms {{does not mean that}} a pulpotomy treated tooth is healthy emphasizing the role of regular follow up of such treated cases...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} whether intracoronal delivery of an apical barrier of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) placed ultrasonically, non-ultrasonically, or ultrasonically with the addi-tion of an <b>intracanal</b> composite resin provided a better seal against bacterial leakage. A second purpose was to determine whether <b>intracanal</b> composite resin or gutta-percha and sealer placed against an apical barrier of MTA provided greater resistance to root fracture. In a standardized in vitro open apex model, MTA was placed as an apical barrier at a thickness of 4 mm, with and without ultrasonic vibration. The barriers were challenged with bacteria exposure within a leak-age model, and fracture resistance was assesse...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the coronal microleakage of endodontically treated teeth prepared to receive an <b>intracanal</b> post and teeth with an <b>intracanal</b> post but without a prosthetic crown and exposed to contamination by fresh human saliva. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A mechanical-chemical preparation following the step-back technique was carried out in 35 extracted single-rooted human teeth. The teeth were randomly divided into five groups: G 1 =root canals instrumented, obturated, and prepared to receive an <b>intracanal</b> post (N= 10); G 2 =root canals with cemented posts but without coronal sealing (N= 10); PC 1 =positive control root canals instrumented and open (N= 5); PC 2 =positive control 2 root canals without instrumentation and open (N= 5); and NC=negative control healthy teeth (N= 5). The crowns were removed except for the control group of intact teeth. The root canals were obturated and sterilized with cobalt 60 gamma irradiation and were then adapted in an apparatus using a Brain Heart Infusion (BHI) medium and fresh human saliva for contamination. Microbial growth was indicated by the presence of turbidity in the BHI liquid medium. RESULTS: Data were submitted to the Kaplan-Meier Survival Analysis and the Holm-Sidak statistic method, which observed an index of 90 % of microleakage in root canals after 24 hours for G 1 and 70 % of microleakage in samples at the end of 40 days for G 2. CONCLUSION: The results show that root canals with an <b>intracanal</b> post but without a prosthetic crown can be recontaminated when exposed to fresh human saliva in a short period...|$|E
40|$|Abstract This {{clinical}} {{study investigated the}} effects of endodontic treatment by using different irrigants (limewater + NaOCl and polymyxin B + NaOCl) and <b>intracanal</b> medication on endotoxins in teeth with primary endodontic infection and radiographically visible apical periodontitis. Thirty-three teeth with necrotic pulp and periapical lesions from different patients were selected for this study. Samples were collected after the coronal opening (S 1) and after instrumentation (S 2). Root canals were divided in 3 groups (n = 11) according to the irrigant combination used: NaOCl + LW: 2. 5 % NaOCl + calcium hydroxide solution (0. 14 %, limewater); NaOCl + PmB: 2. 5 % NaOCl + 10. 000 UI/mL polymyxin B; 2. 5 % NaOCl (control). The third sampling (S 3) was performed after ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and the fourth (S 4) after samples got 14 days with <b>intracanal</b> medication with 2 % chlorhexidine gel + calcium hydroxide. Endotoxins (lipopolysaccharide) were quantified by chromogenic Limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL). Endotoxins were detected in all root canals after the coronal opening (S 1). NaOCl + PmB group presented the greatest endotoxin reduction after instrumentation (76. 17 %), similar to NaOCl + LW group (67. 64 %, p< 0. 05) and different from NaOCl group (42. 17 %, p< 0. 05). After <b>intracanal</b> medication period (S 4), there was significant increase of endotoxins neutralization. It was concluded that NaOCl + PmB promoted the greatest reduction of endotoxin levels, followed by NaOCl + LW. <b>Intracanal</b> medications had no significant complementary role in the reduction of endotoxins {{at the end of}} the treatmen...|$|E
