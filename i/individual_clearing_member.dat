40|$|A <b>clearing</b> <b>member</b> of a Central Counterparty (CCP) {{is exposed}} to losses on their default fund and initial margin contributions. Such losses can be {{incurred}} whenever the CCP has insufficient funds to unwind the portfolio of a defaulting <b>clearing</b> <b>member.</b> This does not necessarily require the default of the CCP itself. In this note we aim to quantify the risk a financial institution has when facing a CCP. We show that a <b>clearing</b> <b>member’s</b> CCP risk is given by a sum of exposures {{to each of the}} other <b>clearing</b> <b>members.</b> This arises because of the implicit default insurance that each member has provided in the form of mutualised, loss sharing collateral. We calculate the exposures by explicitly modeling the capital structure of a CCP as well as the loss distributions of the individual member portfolios. An important consideration in designing the model is the limited transparency with respect to the portfolio composition and collateral levels of <b>individual</b> <b>clearing</b> <b>members.</b> To overcome this we leverage the fact that, for a typical CCP, margin levels are risk-based. In particular, we parameterise the portfolio loss tail as a Pareto distribution and we calibrate this to the CCP defined probability of losses exceeding the posted initial margin levels. A key aspect of the model is that we explicitly take into account wrong-way risk, i. e. the fact that member defaults are more likely to occur in stressed market conditions, as well as potential contagion between a member’s default and the losses on his portfolio. Opinions expressed in this paper are those of the author, and do not necessarily reflect the view of JP Morgan. We would like to thank Andrew Abrahams for originating the project on CCP risk and for shaping many of the key ideas. We also thank Regis Guichard, Joe Holderness, Mitchell Smith, Marnie Rosenberg and Rajalakshmi Ramanath for valuable discussions. a...|$|R

Central counterparties may call for intraday margin {{on a routine}} basis, but also in case of extreme price volatility or large changes in positions of <b>clearing</b> <b>members.</b> An increase {{in the use of}} a routine intraday margin call can be seen at central counterparties in the EU. Three central counterparties have recently introduced a routine intraday margin call and two central counterparties intend to do so.

In addition, an overview is given of the benefits, cost and side effects of intraday margining to the central counterparty, its <b>clearing</b> <b>members</b> and the capital market in general.

40|$|The G 20 OTC (over-the-counter) {{derivatives}} reforms impose large collateral/liquidity {{demands on}} <b>clearing</b> <b>members</b> of Central Counterparty (CCP) clearing platforms {{in the form}} of initial margins, variation margins and contributions to the default fund.

The authors extend this analysis to include the European Market Infrastructure Regulation (EMIR) skin-in-the-game requirements for CCPs, which aim to ameliorate the contributions to the default fund by <b>clearing</b> <b>members</b> and also to prevent moral hazard problems associated with the too-interconnected-to-fail (TITF) status of CCPs as more and more derivatives are centrally cleared.

40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{increasing}} {{efforts have been}} put into the development of effective stress tests to quantify the resilience of financial institutions. Here we propose a stress test methodology for central counterparties based on a network characterization of <b>clearing</b> <b>members,</b> whose links correspond to direct credits and debits. This network constitutes the ground for the propagation of financial distress: equity losses caused by an initial shock with both exogenous and endogenous components reverberate within the network and are amplified through credit and liquidity contagion channels. At {{the end of the}} dynamics, we determine the vulnerability of each <b>clearing</b> <b>member,</b> which represents its potential equity loss. We apply the proposed framework to the Fixed Income asset class of CC&G, the central counterparty operating in Italy whose main cleared securities are Italian Government Bonds. We consider two different scenarios: a distributed, plausible initial shock, as well as a shock corresponding to the cover 2 regulatory requirement (the simultaneous default of the two most exposed <b>clearing</b> <b>members).</b> Although the two situations lead to similar results after an unlimited reverberation of shocks on the network, the distress propagation is much more hasty in the latter case, with a large number of additional defaults triggered at early stages of the dynamics. Our results thus show that setting a default fund to cover insolvencies only on a cover 2 basis may not be adequate for taming systemic events, and only very conservative default funds, such as CC&G's one, can face total losses due to the shock propagation. Overall, our network-based stress test represents a refined tool for calibrating default fund amounts...|$|R
