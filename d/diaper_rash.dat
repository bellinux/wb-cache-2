40|$|Barrier creams and barrier creams with {{antifungal}} agents {{both are}} effective treatments of diaper dermatitis. Fungal yeast {{is present in}} over 90 % of <b>diaper</b> <b>rashes,</b> but {{is not necessarily the}} causative agent. In mild cases, antifungal agents may not perform better than barrier creams alone. In moderate to severe cases, patients will likely benefit from using an antifungal agent. For patients at increased risk for diaper dermatitis, such as those with diarrhea, taking oral antibiotics, wearing low-absorbance diaper material, better prevention may be possible using barrier cream with antifungal. In all cases, diaper dermatitis is best dealt with by following the ABCDEs: Air exposure –allow the diapered area to air dry, don’t over-tighten the diaper, allow naked nap time on a towel when possible Barrier cream – zinc oxide or petroleum, reapply with every diaper change, creams with antifungal agents may be better in severe rashes or when yeast infection is suspected Cleanliness – frequent diaper changes and baths, pat dry with a towel or air dry, avoid wipes with alcohol or scent Diaper changes – frequent changes, the less time spent in a dirty diaper the betterespecially with loose stools or low-absorbance diapers Education – teach caregivers about care of diapered chil...|$|R
25|$|Wool pants, or, once available, rubber pants, were {{sometimes}} used over the cloth diaper to prevent leakage. Doctors believed that rubber pants were harmful {{because they thought}} the rubber acted as a poultice and damaged the skin of infants. The constant problem to be overcome was <b>diaper</b> <b>rash,</b> and the infection thereof. The concern was that lack of air circulation would worsen this condition. While lack of air circulation is a factor, it was later found that poor hygiene involving inefficiently washed diapers and infrequent changes of diapers, along with allowing the baby to lie for prolonged periods of time with fecal matter {{in contact with the}} skin, were the two main causes of these problems.|$|E

Diapering may possibly serve as a good bonding experience for parent and child. Children who wear diapers may experience skin irritation, {{commonly referred to as}} <b>diaper</b> <b>rash,</b> due to continual contact with fecal matter, as feces contains urease which catalyzes the conversion of the urea in urine to ammonia which can irritate the skin and can cause painful redness.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Fertilisation of {{land with}} {{processed}} sewage sludges, which often contain {{low levels of}} pathogens, endotoxins, and trace amounts of industrial and household chemicals, has become common practice in Western Europe, the US, and Canada. Local governments, however, are increasingly restricting or banning the practice in response to residents reporting adverse health effects. These self-reported illnesses have not been studied and methods for assessing exposures of residential communities to contaminants from processed sewage sludges need to be developed. Methods To describe and document adverse effects reported by residents, 48 individuals at ten sites in the US and Canada were questioned about their environmental exposures and symptoms. Information was obtained on five additional cases where an outbreak of staphylococcal infections occurred near a land application site in Robesonia, PA. Medical records were reviewed in cases involving hospitalisation or other medical treatment. Since most complaints were associated with airborne contaminants, an air dispersion model {{was used as a}} means for potentially ruling out exposure to sludge as the cause of adverse effects. Results Affected residents lived within approximately 1 km of land application sites and generally complained of irritation (e. g., skin rashes and burning of the eyes, throat, and lungs) after exposure to winds blowing from treated fields. A prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus infections of the skin and respiratory tract was found. Approximately 1 in 4 of 54 individuals were infected, including 2 mortalities (septicaemia, pneumonia). This result was consistent with the prevalence of S. aureus infections accompanying <b>diaper</b> <b>rashes</b> in which the organism, which is commonly found in the lower human colon, tends to invade irritated or inflamed tissue. Conclusions When assessing public health risks from applying sewage sludges in residential areas, potential interactions of chemical contaminants with low levels of pathogens should be considered. An increased risk of infection may occur when allergic and non-allergic reactions to endotoxins and other chemical components irritate skin and mucus membranes and thereby compromise normal barriers to infection. </p...|$|R
40|$|<b>Diaper</b> dermatitis(Diaper <b>rash)</b> is {{the most}} common {{cutaneous}} disorder of infancy and childhood. Although the etiology of this condition remains unknown, an amalgam of various causes (mechanical friction, moisture, contact with urine and feces, variation of skin pH, fungal infection) bring about this common dermatitis. Because most diaper dermatitis is treated conservatively at home, the frequency is unknown, but from 7 %- 35 % up to 50 % has been reported. Therefore the frequency of diaper dermatitis and related aggravating factors in 1 - 2 years old children was studied at nursing home of Hamadan at year 2000 - 2001. The study was cross-sectional, descriptive on 385 children using randomized selection and data was collected by questionnaire and completed by direct observation. In this study 79 (20. 5 %) subjects had diaper dermatitis, there was meaningful association with” educational level of mother, age of child and use of disposable diaper(p< 0. 05) ”. There was no meaningful relation with sex. The most prominent region of involvement was combination of perineum –genitalia-buttock-thighs. For better controlling of diaper dermatitis we should consider the proper health education for mother and nursing home instructors, and using of super absorbent diapers...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} the {{treatment}} of geriatric patients in a home environment {{is due to the}} more current demographic trends. The treatment of these patients is not easy and brings a number of problematic situations. Therefore, it is necessary to think, what the quality of care is in a home environment and how the family of geriatric patients on changes in his health will adapt. It is also important the education and the support of the lay family caregivers in the theoretical and practical knowledge and skills necessary to provide high-quality care. In the theoretical part of the outlined the division of age, characteristics of the geriatric patient, problems that can affect the patients and the carings and the home care. For geriatric patients are mainly the geriatric syndromes and the geriatric frailty. The carings and health professionals talk often about burnout. The main objective of the Bachelor thesis was to map the treatment of the infirm geriatric patients in a home environment. The singular targets have been set as follows: The experience of the non professional caregivers care of geriatric patients infirm in the domestic environment. To find out the problem situation in connection with the care of geriatric patients infirm in the domestic environment. Find out ways to resolve problem situations in the care of geriatric patients infirm in the domestic environment. To find out the needs of non professional carers in care of geriatric infirm patients in a home environment. To find out, how is the cooperation between doctors, nurses and lay carers to ensure the care of geriatric patients in a home environment. Research file was consisted of the geriatric infirm patients older 65 years in home care of the non professional lay carers, their family members and the professional nurses of the home care agencies. For the Bachelor thesis was used qualitative research strategy. To obtain the requisite information has been used polling method, technique of data collection was a free interview. The obtained data was processed by the technique of open coding, method of pencil and paper. Subsequently, the reduction was carried out with the data organized into categories and subcategories. There were created seven categories and sixteen subcategories. Some caregivers suffer from economic, social, psychological and health problems. It was found that the caregivers were forced to do in their lives many fundamental changes. They all had to adjust the housing, in some cases they had to move or even leave their jobs. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} family is not whole in all patients, and therefore in two cases, there is nobody who could who rotates in the care of the infirm member of the family. Many of the problems were turned out as well for example, that many patients suffer from the <b>diaper</b> <b>rashes,</b> problems with defecation, obesity, depression, and other. Lay caregivers do not have enough information about the care or compensatory utilities. Often they suffer from health problems, such as back pain, depression, burnout, insomnia and other. The work can be used as a source of information for students of nursing and professional nurses. Many of the shortcomings are evident after charting nursing home care. The most alarming is the lack of information. Therefore it is necessary to develop care and ensure that most patients could be treated at home. The economic and psychological support of the non professional caregivers and especially the prevention of burnout are highly important. Home care can lead to the better medical outcomes and the lower costs for care...|$|R
50|$|The {{interaction}} between fecal enzyme activity and IDD explains {{the observation that}} infant diet and <b>diaper</b> <b>rash</b> are linked because fecal enzymes are in turn affected by diet. Breast-fed babies, for example, have a lower incidence of <b>diaper</b> <b>rash,</b> possibly because their stools have higher pH and lower enzymatic activity. <b>Diaper</b> <b>rash</b> is also {{most likely to be}} diagnosed in infants 8 - 12 months old, perhaps in response to an increase in eating solid foods and dietary changes around that age that affect fecal composition.

40|$|M. Tech. <b>Diaper</b> {{dermatitis}} (Nappy <b>Rash)</b> is {{an acute}} {{inflammation of the}} skin in the diaper area and is the most common cutaneous disease among infants and children (Concannon et al., 2001). It is estimated that 7 % - 35 % of diaper wearing infants are affected by Diaper dermatitis during the period of wearing diapers (Barkin and Rosen, 2003). The exact prevalence is not known as many cases are selfmedicated by parents or guardians (Wolf et al., 2000). Diaper dermatitis causes severe discomfort to the infants as well as anxiety and worry for the parents. Diaper dermatitis is characterised by redness, inflammation, dryness, scaling, itching, irritability, pain, satellite lesions, papulovesicular or pustular eruptions, and in severe cases ulceration of the skin (Visscher and Hoath, 2006). This study aimed to assess the efficacy of a Homoeopathic complex cream as a topical treatment for Diaper dermatitis. The complex consisted of Atropa belladonna 6 cH, Calendula officinalis D 1 and Sulphuricum acidum 6 cH. Madaji milking cream was used as a base which contained: chlorhexidene; vitamin E; and lanolin. The treatment group received the medicated Madaji milking cream whereas the control group received the unmedicated Madaji milking cream. The Diaper dermatitis was evaluated using a 4 -Point Grading Scale (Appendix D) and The Modified Lund and Browder Chart (Appendix E). Forty participants who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria were recruited to participate in this double blind control study by means of advertisements (Appendix A) that were placed on notice boards at the various campuses of the University of Johannesburg, nursery schools and hospitals, with relevant permission given. Participants were also recruited via word of mouth. Once participants were accepted into the study they were allocated to either Group A or Group B using matched pairs according to severity in order to ensure equal v distribution in both groups. There were 20 participants in each group. Group A was the treatment group which received the medicated Madaji milking cream. Group B was the control group which received the unmedicated Madaji cream. The study was completed over a seven day period. The ten areas most commonly affected by Diaper dermatitis were evaluated on the initial visit, day two, day four and day seven...|$|R
