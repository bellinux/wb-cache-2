25|$|Upon {{returning}} to Kenya, Maathai dropped her forename, preferring {{to be known}} by her birth name, Wangari Muta. When {{she arrived at the}} university to start her new job, she was informed that it had been given to someone else. Maathai believed this was because of gender and tribal bias. After a two-month job search, Professor Reinhold Hofmann, from the University of Giessen in Germany, offered her a job as a research assistant in the microanatomy section of the newly established Department of Veterinary Anatomy in the School of Veterinary Medicine at University College of Nairobi. In April 1966, she met Mwangi Maathai, another Kenyan who had studied <b>in</b> <b>America,</b> <b>who</b> would later become her husband. She also rented a small shop in the city, and established a general store, at which her sisters worked. In 1967, at the urging of Professor Hofmann, she traveled to the University of Giessen in Germany in pursuit of a doctorate. She studied both at Giessen and the University of Munich.|$|E

500|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, logical positivists fled Germany and Austria for Britain and America. [...] By then, many had {{replaced}} Mach's phenomenalism with Otto Neurath's physicalism, and Rudolf Carnap {{had sought to}} replace verification with simply confirmation. [...] With World War II's close in 1945, logical positivism became milder, logical empiricism, led largely by Carl Hempel, <b>in</b> <b>America,</b> <b>who</b> expounded the covering law model of scientific explanation {{as a way of}} identifying the logical form of explanations without any reference to the suspect notion of [...] "causation". [...] The logical positivist movement became a major underpinning of analytic philosophy, and dominated Anglosphere philosophy, including philosophy of science, while influencing sciences, into the 1960s. [...] Yet the movement failed to resolve its central problems, and its doctrines were increasingly assaulted. Nevertheless, it brought about the establishment of philosophy of science as a distinct subdiscipline of philosophy, with Carl Hempel playing a key role.|$|E
500|$|Breckinridge's three-hour {{speech was}} {{primarily}} defensive; his moderate tone {{was designed to}} win votes in the north but risked losing Southern support to Bell. He denied charges that he had supported Zachary Taylor over Lewis Cass in 1848, that he had sided with abolitionists in 1849, {{and that he had}} sought John Brown's pardon for the Harpers Ferry raid. Reminding the audience that Douglas wanted the Supreme Court to decide the issue of slavery in the territories, he pointed out that Douglas then denounced the Dred Scott ruling and laid out a means for territorial legislatures to circumvent it. Breckinridge supported the legitimacy of secession but insisted it was not the solution to the country's sectional disagreements. In answer to Douglas's charge that there was not [...] "a disunionist <b>in</b> <b>America</b> <b>who</b> is not a Breckinridge man", he challenged the assembled crowd [...] "to point out an act, to disclose an utterance, to reveal a thought of mine hostile to the constitution and union of the States". He warned that Lincoln's insistence on emancipation made him the real disunionist.|$|E

500|$|After {{staying in}} Limpsfield, Surrey, {{for a few}} days, Crane and Taylor settled in Ravensbrook, a plain brick villa in Oxted. [...] Referring to {{themselves}} as Mr. and Mrs. Crane, the couple lived openly in England, but Crane concealed the relationship from {{his friends and family}} in the United States. [...] Admired in England, Crane thought himself attacked back home: [...] "There seem so many of them <b>in</b> <b>America</b> <b>who</b> want to kill, bury and forget me purely out of unkindness and envy and—my unworthiness, if you choose", he wrote. [...] Velestino the dog sickened and died soon after their arrival in England, on August 1. [...] Crane, who had a great love for dogs, wrote an emotional letter to a friend an hour after the dog's death, stating that [...] "for eleven days we fought death for him, thinking nothing of anything but his life." [...] The Limpsfield-Oxted area was home to members of the socialist Fabian Society and a magnet for writers such as Edmund Gosse, Ford Madox Ford and Edward Garnett. [...] Crane also met the Polish-born novelist Joseph Conrad in October 1897, with whom he would have what Crane called a [...] "warm and endless friendship".|$|E
500|$|In the four-way contest, Breckinridge came {{in third}} in the popular vote, with 18.1%, but second in the Electoral College. The final electoral vote was 180 for Lincoln, 72 for Breckinridge, 39 for Bell, and 12 for Douglas. Although Breckinridge won {{the states of the}} Deep South, his support in those states came mostly from rural areas with low slave populations; the urban areas with higher slave populations {{generally}} went for Bell or Douglas. Breckinridge also carried the border states of Maryland and Delaware. Historian James C. Klotter points out in light of these results that, while Douglas maintained that there was [...] "not a disunionist <b>in</b> <b>America</b> <b>who</b> is not a Breckinridge man", {{it is more likely that}} party loyalty and economic status played a more prominent role in Breckinridge's support than did issues of slavery and secession. He lost to Douglas in Missouri and Bell in Virginia and Tennessee. Bell also captured Breckinridge's home state, Kentucky. Lincoln swept most of the northern states, although New Jersey split its electoral votes, giving four to Lincoln and three to Douglas. As the candidate of the Buchanan faction, Breckinridge outpolled Douglas in Pennsylvania and received support comparable to Douglas in Connecticut, although he received very little support elsewhere in the North. It was Breckinridge's duty as vice-president to announce Lincoln as the winner of the electoral college vote on February 13, 1861.|$|E

500|$|Following Terry-Thomas's death, Lionel Jeffries {{called him}} [...] "the {{last of the}} great gentlemen of the cinema", while the {{director}} Michael Winner commented that [...] "no matter what your position was in relation to his, as the star he was always terribly nice.

Not to put too serious a point on it, his portrayal of crass stupidity and blatant deviousness struck a chord with British audiences during the fifties as they experienced the clumsy dismemberment of the Empire and the 'never had it so good' ethos of the Macmillan era. During the sixties he became a glorious anachronism, much in demand <b>in</b> <b>America,</b> <b>who</b> saw in him the irrelevant pageantry of Britain"; {{he also said that}} Terry-Thomas was [...] "a national treasure". Gilbert Adair, writing in The Independent, considered that [...] "for three decades, and in literally scores of films, he personified the Englishman as amiable bounder"; Adair wrote that [...] "the characterisation he was to assume represented the very essence of patrician, double-barrelled caddishness". Terry-Thomas's friend Jack Lemmon called him [...] "a consummate professional... he was a gentleman, a delight to be with personally, let alone professionally, and above all as an actor he had one of the qualities that I admire so much—he made it look simple".|$|E
