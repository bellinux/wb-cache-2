Regarding the film Big Trouble in Little China, Tobias wrote that although this movie [...] "kind of Americanized my obsession for supernatural kung fu films from China, it was not my biggest influence. My biggest influences came from Tsui Hark films -- Zu Warriors & The Swordsman. We had to get them from bootleggers in Chicago's Chinatown." [...] Tobias' writing and artistic input on the series ended in 1997. Fifteen years later, he said: [...] "I knew exactly what I was going to do with a future story. A <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>I</b> [...] a sort of sequel to the first MK film and an advancement to the game's mythological roots. The goal was to not runaway from what came before with a retelling, but to move the themes forward. I did it for fun as an exercise in screenwriting, but it felt good to get that out of my system." ...|$|E

[...] The {{subsequent}} gamettes, in building on that start, only complicated matters by attempting to patch that foundation rather than replace it altogether....here's how I rationalize it. [...] A <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> ...<b>I</b> was so enamored by (video cassette recorders) that I just had to have one. [...] Two years later they were selling models for half the price with twice the features which mine had. [...] Sometimes I regret buying that VCR so soon, but then I recall all the fun I had with it when it was new and eventually concluded that my money was well spent after all.|$|E
2500|$|William Holden and Stanwyck {{were friends}} of long standing. [...] When Stanwyck and Holden were {{presenting}} the Best Sound Oscar for 1977, Holden paused {{to pay a}} special tribute to her for saving his career when Holden was cast in the lead for Golden Boy (1939). After a series of unsteady daily performances, {{he was about to}} be fired, but Stanwyck staunchly defended him, successfully standing up to the film producers. Shortly after Holden's death, Stanwyck recalled the moment when receiving her honorary Oscar: [...] "A <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago</b> <b>I</b> stood on this stage with William Holden as a presenter. I loved him very much, and I miss him. He always wished that I would get an Oscar. And so tonight, my golden boy, you got your wish." ...|$|E

Says Gray, [...] "Well, a <b>few</b> <b>years</b> <b>ago,</b> <b>I</b> submitted a story to an editor who wrote back and said it was the sickest thing she ever read, but then she said it was [...] "sick in the best sense of the word". I may be warped, but knowing that the editor had seen a lot of bizarre stuff in her career, I took her comment as a huge compliment, especially since the story was as psychological as it was gritty-physical. I went on to sell it elsewhere (twice!), and it received a Stoker recommendation, so I guess others thought it [...] "sick" [...] as well." ...|$|E

5000|$|I {{would always}} be {{frustrated}} with all those relationships even when I was engaged.
