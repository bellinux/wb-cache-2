Mossadegh is remembered in Iran for having been voted into power through a democratic election, nationalizing Iran's British-owned oil fields, and being deposed in a military coup d'état organized by an American CIA operative and aided by the British MI6.

40|$|The Massachusetts Military Reservation <b>Installation</b> and <b>Restoration</b> Program (MMRIRP) {{regularly}} approves pump-and-treat {{systems to}} contain migrating plumes at the MMR.

Materials and Methods: In the first chapter, 28 metal free restorations were installed, being 15 with Rely X Veneer (RV), 13 with Variolink Veneer (VV), cemented according to a Split-mouth design clinical trial model.

40|$|This {{research}} quantified {{the effectiveness}} of agricultural riparian buffers to protect stream health in Maryland's Coastal Plain and Piedmont physiographic regions. Easily-obtainable data were used to develop scientific guidance for buffer management strategies. Three data sets were used: the 1998 University of Maryland Agricultural Buffer Survey, the 1996 Smithsonian Environmental Research Center Water Quality Survey, and the 1995 - 1997 Maryland Biological Stream Survey. Collectively, these data were used to represent baseflow water quality and landscape conditions in agricultural catchments. A set of landscape characteristics describing the agricultural riparian landscape was developed, from which a classification system for agricultural riparian landscapes was developed. The Agricultural Riparian Classification System can identify a subset of sites for targeted research. Additionally, the distribution of agricultural riparian buffers was characterized. Although over 70 % of sites were buffered, because the statewide average buffer width was approximately 49 meters, almost 50 % of buffers could not be detected by remotely sensed data with a resolution of 30 meters. Models were developed to predict measures of stream health at a site. Buffers acted differently on instream nitrate concentration, fish IBI (FIBI), benthic IBI (BIBI), and instream physical habitat (PHI). All models indicated that nitrate source terms overshadowed any on-site buffer effects and that Confined Animal Feeding Operations and pastures acted as point sources, overwhelming non-point-source effects. Therefore, livestock best managements practices are critical for the reduction of nitrate to streams. Fish IBI, benthic IBI and physical habitat index (PHI) in the Piedmont region were unaffected by buffer presence, but benthic IBI and PHI in the Coastal Plain were affected by buffer presence, type and width. Regression tree modeling was able to delineate a range of minimum effective buffer width between 22 - 38 meters. All measures of stream health in Piedmont systems were controlled by hydrology and geomorphology. Therefore, insofar as buffers can mediate hydrologic effects on flow conditions in a stream, they may indirectly affect FIBI, and BIBI and PHI in Piedmont systems. Use of fish IBI to measure success of buffer <b>installation</b> or <b>restoration</b> would give false results...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{transfer}} the provisional restoration emergence profile to the final implant-supported restoration and to buccal gingival margin (BGM) stability after 2 years of function. Materials and Methods: A total of 33 patients were recruited for treatment of single gaps by means of 33 implant-supported restorations. Fixed provisional crowns were screwed to the fixture and adjusted until the complete peri-implant soft tissue maturation was achieved. After 12 weeks, a second fixture impression was taken by means of a pick-up customization technique in order to transfer the clinical aspect of the peri-implant soft tissues to the master cast. A definitive restoration was delivered. A standardized method from digital photographs was used to assess the gingival margin modification (BGM) from the provisional (P) to the definitive prosthesis installation at baseline (D 0), and after 1 (D 1) and 2 years (D 2) of function. Also, marginal bone loss (MBL) was calculated after 1 (D 1) and 2 years (D 2) of definitive restoration function. Results: The BGM index at the time of the final <b>restoration</b> <b>installation</b> (D 0) was 0. 12 +/- 0. 33 mm if compared with the BGM position of the provisional restoration (P); it was of 0. 12 +/- 0. 46 mm after 1 -year of follow-up (D 1) and of 0. 31 +/- 0. 21 after 2 years of function (D 2). No significant difference was calculated between measurements in different follow-up visits (p > 0. 05). No significant MBL was measured between the baseline (D 0) and the 1 -year follow-up (p = 0. 816) with a mean MBL value of 0. 2 +/- 0. 1 mm. Similar result was calculated after 2 years (p = 0. 684) with a mean MBL value of 0. 3 +/- 0. 2. Conclusion: A modified impression pick-up may be helpful to reproduce the gingival margin position from the provisional to the definitive restoration.
