40|$|Energy {{efficiency}} and conservation are considered key means for reducing {{greenhouse gas emissions}} and achieving other energy policy goals, but associated market behavior and policy responses have engendered debates in the economic literature. We review economic concepts underlying consumer decision making in energy {{efficiency and}} conservation and examine related empirical literature. In particular, we provide an economic perspective on the range of market barriers, market failures, and behavioral failures that have been cited in the energy efficiency context. We assess {{the extent to which}} these conditions provide a motivation for policy intervention in <b>energy-using</b> <b>product</b> markets, including an examination of the evidence on policy effectiveness and cost.

40|$|In many regions, {{renewable}} energy targets are a primary decarbonization policy.

With multiple market failures (emissions externality and imperfect competition), renewable market share targets as the binding climate policy, and international trade in equipment, {{the stage is set}} to examine rationales for green industrial policy. Subsidies may be provided downstream to energy suppliers and/or upstream to technology suppliers; each has tradeoffs. Subsidies can offset underprovision upstream, but they allow dirty generation to expand when the portfolio standard becomes less binding. Downstream subsidies raise all upstream profits and crowd out foreign emissions. Upstream subsidies increase domestic upstream market share but expand emissions globally. In our two-region model, strategic subsidies chosen noncooperatively can be optimal from a global perspective, if both regions value emissions at the global cost of carbon.

There is currently no standardised approach to resolving this conflict. The article describes an original method for environmentally assessing the durability of <b>energy-using</b> <b>products</b> in order to identify if and to what extent the potential extension of the product's lifetime could have life-cycle benefits. The method is based on the comparison, within a life-cycle perspective, of two scenarios of different lifetimes of a target product and its potential substitution with better performing alternatives. The method considers some key parameters of durability, including the product's lifetime, energy consumptions, impacts of lifetime extension and characteristics of the replacement product. The method can be used for ecodesign purposes by manufacturers or by policy makers. The applicability and robustness of the method are discussed, including limitations, difficulties and possible improvement. A general index and a simplified index have been introduced. The applicability and relevance of the simplified durability index is shown in two case-studies (of washing machines). The article shows that some life-cycle environmental benefits can be gained by extending the lifetime of the products.

40|$|Does {{technological}} innovation {{to improve the}} efficiency of <b>energy-using</b> <b>products</b> and systems lead to lower energy consumption and hence reduced environmental impacts? The answer given by economists since the mid nineteenth century is â€˜noâ€™. This is because there are direct â€˜reboundâ€™ or â€˜take-backâ€™ effects caused by energy efficiency improvements that lower the implicit price of energy, often leading to greater consumption. Also there are secondary or indirect effects of reducing energy costs through efficiency in that consumers may buy more products and/or choose, larger, more powerful, more feature laden models. Thus just promoting technical innovation to increase energy efficiency is unlikely to lead to reduced energy consumption and emissions. Other policies such as taxation or regulation are required. As well as setting the theoretical arguments concerning innovation and energy efficiency the paper outlines results from an empirical research project, â€˜People-centred eco-designâ€™, which seeks to identify the key influencing factors on consumer adoption and effective use of energy efficient products and systems. In particular it aims to identify how consumers may avoid (or mitigate) rebound effects and how manufacturers, service providers and government might design and promote such products to achieve their optimal environmental benefits...|$|R

The established design process consists of a sequence of decisions to be made, mainly based on technological and economic aspects, but in general not considering the environmental consequences.

After a brief review of the policy history surrounding SCP, we organize our discussion and the subsequent collection of articles into two groups.

This work confirms and refines several insights that have been developing over the past several years, namely that food and beverages, mobility, housing, and <b>energy-using</b> <b>products</b> are the most critical consumption domains from the standpoint of environmental sustainability and that higher household income leads to greater (but less than proportional) impacts. The second subset of articles analyzes the potential for mitigating these impacts through behavioral changes and innovation strategies.

Previous studies have shown that the variable-flow fluid motion applications (pumps, fans, and compressors) have the largest savings potential. In this paper, an ecodesign analysis of two different technologies for the flow regulation in pumping systemsâ€”constant-speed pump with an output throttle valve (motor directly fed from the line) and variable-speed pump without an output throttle valve (motor fed by a variable-speed drive) â€”is presented. A European standard methodology for the ecodesign analysis of <b>energy-using</b> <b>products</b> is used in this paper. This paper includes a comparative analysis of the environmental impacts and life-cycle costs.
