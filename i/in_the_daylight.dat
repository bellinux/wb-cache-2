This movement was not completed until 23March, and a general attack began after sundown with shelling and skirmishes prior {{to a series of}} assaults through the low ground. This proved the final element of the Japanese counterattack. Forewarned by captured plans, the US troops had been expecting the attack. A heavy American artillery barrage fell on the main Japanese assault forces as they formed up, and disrupted their advance with heavy casualties. Nevertheless, the Japanese succeeded in capturing a number of forward positions. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>daylight</b> on 24March, US troops launched a heavy counterattack as large numbers of reserves were poured in to the sector, supported by seven artillery battalions, halting the Japanese offensive for good. Finally, Hyakutake called an end to the operation. As the attackers withdrew, Fijian troops and US soldiers from Griswold's reserve pursued them on 25March.|$|E
25|$|The Romans {{regarded}} Jupiter as {{the equivalent}} of the Greek Zeus, and in Latin literature and Roman art, the myths and iconography of Zeus are adapted under the name Iuppiter. In the Greek-influenced tradition, Jupiter was the brother of Neptune and Pluto, the Roman equivalents of Poseidon and Hades respectively. Each presided over one of the three realms of the universe: sky, the waters, and the underworld.

25|$|In 1936 a {{fragment}} of a similar Temple warning inscription was found. After 1967, archaeologists found that the wall extended {{all the way around}} the Temple Mount and is part of the city wall near the Lions' Gate. Thus, the Western Wall is not the only remaining part of the Temple Mount. Currently, Robinson's Arch (named after American Edward Robinson) remains as the beginning of an arch that spanned the gap between the top of the platform and the higher ground farther away. This had been used by the priests as an entrance. Commoners had entered through the still-extant, but now plugged, gates on the southern side which led through colonnades to the top of the platform. One of these colonnades is still extant and reachable through the Temple Mount. The Southern wall was designed as a grand entrance. Recent archeological digs have found thousands of mikvehs (ceremonial bathtubs) for the ritual purification of the worshipers, as well as a grand stairway leading to the now blocked entrance. Inside the walls, the platform was supported by a series of vaulted archways, now called Solomon's Stables, which still exist and whose current renovation by the Waqf is extremely controversial. The temple itself was constructed of imported white marble that gleamed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>daylight.</b>|$|E

40|$|The ® rst step <b>in</b> {{evaluating}} <b>the</b> {{visual performance}} and energy ef ® ciency provided by daylight requires an accurate estimation of <b>the</b> amount of <b>daylight</b> entering a building. Traditionally, <b>the</b> <b>daylight</b> {{performance of a}} building is often evaluated in terms of <b>daylight</b> factors with <b>the</b> calculations being based on the CIE overcast sky. <b>In</b> general, <b>the</b> <b>daylight</b> factor approach is quite simple to use but it cannot predict <b>the</b> dynamic variations <b>in</b> interior illuminance as sky conditions and the sun’s position change. The recently introduced concept of <b>the</b> <b>daylight</b> coef ® cient, which needs sky luminance data, provides an alternative approach.

Virgil, in compliment to his patron Augustus and the gens Julia, embellished an existing connection between Venus, whom Julius Caesar had adopted as his protectress, and Aeneas. Vergil's Aeneas is guided to Latium by Venus in her heavenly form, the morning star, shining brightly before him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>daylight</b> sky; much later, she lifts Caesar's soul to heaven.
