ABC News' chief medical correspondent <b>Dr.</b> <b>Tim</b> <b>Johnson</b> commented, [...] "the trend isn't restricted to Minnesota", and has [...] "gotten out of control" [...] as per Dr. Scott Wheeler. Dr. Wheeler, a urologist in Minnesota, has seen an increase of hospitalization caused by [...] "sack tapping" [...] incidents, and commented that criminal charges could be filed against the attacker {{as a result of}} the one instance. The casualty survived the surgery and can function normally with one testicle. The casualty's mother saw [...] "what he went through every day" [...] and withdrew his enrollment from school. [...] "Sack tapping" [...] has grown into a more dangerous game that can result in greater injuries. Dr. Wheeler recommend that parents warn their children of the dangers of [...] "sack tapping".|$|E
