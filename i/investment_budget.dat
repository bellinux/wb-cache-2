However, the airport lacks sufficient apron, duel storage, fire service and other safety measures which were required by the helicopter operators. In 1988, the county's chief of transport recommended that the county municipality give the airport top priority in its <b>investment</b> <b>budget.</b> He argued that the airport should be financed by the state, and that the state should give a grant to the airport the cost of building the runway, and that the airport company use the grants {{to extend the}} runway.|$|E

The private sector makes a limited contribution to finance, mostly through a single BOT that has so far been awarded for a US$160 million wastewater treatment plant. Between 2005 and 2010 Egypt received more than 1bn Euro in external aid for water supply and sanitation, out of which 30% were grants and the remainder soft loans with an average interest rate of 1%. This corresponds to EUR 200 million per year, corresponding to only about 10% of the government's <b>investment</b> <b>budget</b> for the sector in 2009/10. According to the Ministry of Housing, government subsidies to water and wastewater utilities amounted to more than 15 billion Egyptian pounds (USD 2.5bn) in 2009/10, including EP 13.4bn (USD 2.2bn) investment subsidies, EP 0.66 bn (USD 0.1bn) operating subsidies and EP 1 bn (USD 0.2bn) repair and rehabilitation subsidies.|$|E

Reportedly, the two most likely engines are the Pratt & Whitney PW9000 engine, which uses a combination of Pratt & Whitney F135 and commercial turbofan technology, and a derivative of the General Electric/Rolls-Royce F136. In May 2011, Air Force Undersecretary Erin Conaton announced that a program office was being {{set up for the}} bomber. The USAF asked for $292 million for the program in its 2013 budget request. The program has also been referred to as [...] "Long-Range Strike-B" [...] (LRS-B). In 2012, former Pentagon weapons tester Thomas P.

40|$|The {{markets for}} medical {{equipment}} are highly regulated. Innovative technologies must be tested extensively before receiving official authorisation, hospitals' <b>investment</b> <b>budgets</b> are restricted because of cost reductions in health systems, {{and the application}} of medical technologies requires a doctoral admission. These frame conditions set specific barriers and triggers for the servitization of medical technology manufacturers. Hence, in this chapter, {{the state of the art}} of servitization in the German medical technology industry is illustrated. The results from three empirical studies provide the basis for this summary. The findings indicate that specific patterns of servitization can be observed, partially in spite of and partially induced from regulations. Advanced services have reached a remarkable level and serve predominantly as openers for introducing innovative technology into markets, characterised by the small <b>investment</b> <b>budgets</b> of customers. The potential for stimulating process improvements through advanced services is limited because the operation of medical equipment necessarily remains assigned to customers' physicians...|$|R

Consequently, enterprises invest annually substantial financial capital in fixed assets. These investments influence the situation of a firm over many years.
