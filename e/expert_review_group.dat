40|$|Environmental {{health risk}} {{assessment}} is increasingly {{being used in}} the development of environmental health policies, public health decision making, the establishment of environmental regulations, and research planning. The credibility of risk assessment depends, to a large extent, on the strength of the scientific evidence on which it is based. It is, therefore, imperative that the processes and methods used to evaluate the evidence and estimate health risks are clear, explicit, and based on valid epidemiological theory and practice. Epidemiological Evidence for Environmental Health Risk Assessment is a World Health Organization (WHO) guideline document. The primary target audiences of the guidelines are <b>expert</b> <b>review</b> <b>groups</b> that WHO (or other organizations) might convene in the future to evaluate epidemiological evidence on the health effects of environmental factors. These guidelines identify a set of processes and general approaches to assess available epidemiological information in a clear, consistent, and explicit manner. The guidelines should also help in the evaluation of epidemiological studies with respect to their ability to support risk assessment and, consequently, risk management. Conducting <b>expert</b> <b>reviews</b> according to such explicit guidelines would make health risk assessment and subsequent risk management and risk communication processes more readily understood and likely to be accepted by policymakers and the public. It would also make the conclusions reached by reviews more readily acceptable as a basis for future WHO guidelines and other recommendations, and would provide a more rational basis for setting priorities for future research.

40|$|One Health {{is defined}} as the {{intersection}} and integration of knowledge regarding humans, animals, and the environment, yet as the One Health scientific literature expands, there is considerable heterogeneity of approach and quality of reporting in One Health studies. In addition, many researchers who publish such studies do not include or integrate data from all three domains of human, animal, and environmental health. This points to a critical need to unify guidelines for One Health studies. This report details the Checklist for One Health Epidemiological Reporting of Evidence (COHERE) to guide the design and publication format of future One Health studies. COHERE was developed by a core writing team and international <b>expert</b> <b>review</b> <b>group</b> that represents multiple disciplines, including human medicine, veterinary medicine, public health, allied professionals, clinical laboratory science, epidemiology, the social sciences, ecohealth and environmental health. The twin aims of the COHERE standards are to 1) improve the quality of reporting of observational or interventional epidemiological studies that collect and integrate data from humans, animals and/or vectors, and their environments; and 2) promote the concept that One Health studies should integrate knowledge from these three domains.

40|$|Background The {{approach}} to the diagnosis of severe combined immunodeficiency disease (SCID) and related disorders varies among institutions and countries. Objectives The Primary Immune Deficiency Treatment Consortium attempted to develop a uniform set of criteria for diagnosing SCID and related disorders and has evaluated the results {{as part of a}} retrospective study of SCID in North America. Methods Clinical records from 2000 through 2009 at 27 centers in North America were collected on 332 children treated with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HCT), enzyme replacement therapy, or gene therapy for SCID and related disorders. Eligibility for inclusion in the study and classification into disease groups were established by using set criteria and applied by an <b>expert</b> <b>review</b> <b>group.</b> Results Two hundred eighty-five (86 %) of the patients were determined to be eligible, and 47 (14 %) were not eligible. Of the 285 eligible patients, 84 % were classified as having typical SCID; 13 % were classified as having leaky SCID, Omenn syndrome, or reticular dysgenesis; and 3 % had a history of enzyme replacement or gene therapy. Detection of a genotype predicting an SCID phenotype was accepted for eligibility. Reasons for noneligibility were failure to demonstrate either impaired lymphocyte proliferation or maternal T-cell engraftment. Overall (n = 332) rates of testing were as follows: proliferation to PHA, 77 %; maternal engraftment, 35 %; and genotype, 79 % (mutation identified in 62 %). Conclusion Lack of complete laboratory evaluation of patients before HCT presents a significant barrier to definitive diagnosis of SCID and related disorders and prevented inclusion of subjects in our observational HCT study. This lesson is critical for patient care, as well as the design of future prospective treatment studies for such children because a well-defined and consistent study population is important for precision in outcomes analysis. © 2013 American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology...|$|E
40|$|In {{response}} to the growing demand for a test of cognitive ability for South African adults, the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) adapted the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scales, third edition (WAIS-III) for English-speaking South Africans. However, {{since the publication of}} the South African adaptation in 2001, there has been some concern whether some bias may not still be present in the measure. Consequently, this study aimed to qualitatively explore the item content of the South African adaptation of the WAIS-III in order to identify items that might still be potentially biased with specific reference to cultural and linguistic issues. The researcher employed purposive sampling, a non-probability technique, to select psychology professionals to act as expert reviewers. The sample consisted of 20 registered psychologists, psychology lecturers and psychology interns from the predominant culture and language groups of the Eastern and Western Cape. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected by means of a Bias Review Questionnaire which consisted of fixed-choice questions, as well as sections in which specific comments could be indicated. The questionnaire was distributed to 20 selected participants who were qualified to administer psychometric measures and were registered with the Health Professionals Council of South Africa (HPCSA). Qualitative data was analysed using Tesch’s model of thematic content analysis, and five main themes relating to potential bias were identified, namely: Culture, Language, Education, Socio-economic status, and Format. The qualitative data was re-submitted to the <b>expert</b> <b>review</b> <b>group</b> for approval and further comment. Quantitative data obtained from the Bias Review Questionnaire was analysed by obtaining frequency counts, which were converted to percentages, per subtest and aspect reviewed. The major findings of the study were as follows: 1. Cultural bias is evident in the South African adaptation of the WAIS-III. The differential meanings ascribed to concepts, terms, phrases and words by diverse cultures impact on test performance, as does familiarity with stimulus materials used in the measure. 2. Language bias was detected against groups with English as their second or third language owing to the unfamiliar, and sometimes archaic, terms and vocabulary used in the measure. The intended meanings of the translated items are unclear and confusing for test-takers. 3. South African test-takers have experienced vastly divergent educational opportunities which impact on intelligence test performance. The measure contains potential bias against individuals from disadvantaged educational backgrounds. 4. The content of the items is not relevant to test-takers from deprived socioeconomic backgrounds that have been unable to access good-quality education. 5. Format bias was found to exist with respect to the timed tests. Cultural groups who do not value speededness are disadvantaged by the structure and format of the measure. Based on the findings of this study, certain recommendations were made. These include: 1. Additional qualitative investigation of the WAIS-III, with a view to further adaptation in an effort to eradicate bias on cultural or linguistic grounds, and 2. Conducting further Differential Item Functioning (DIF) analyses and establishing construct equivalence across cultural and linguistic groups to promote this objective. Among the contributions believed to have been made by this study are the identification of potentially biased subtests and items on the grounds of culture and language, which will facilitate possible further revision and adaptation of the measure. Additionally, the variables that were considered important influencing factors of cognitive test performance have been documented and are accessible for future research that will supplement the present study...|$|E
