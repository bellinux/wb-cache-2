50|$|This type is superficially {{very similar}} to a {{resonance}} absorption isolator, but the magnetic biassing differs, and the energy from the backward travelling signal is absorbed in a resistive film or card on one face of the ferrite block rather than within the ferrite itself. The bias field is weaker than that necessary to cause resonance at the operating frequency, but is instead designed to give the ferrite zero permeability for one sense of rotation of the microwave signal field. The bias polarity is such that this special condition arises for the <b>forward</b> <b>signal,</b> while the backward signal sees the ferrite as an ordinary permeable material. Consequently, the electromagnetic field of the <b>forward</b> <b>signal</b> tends to be excluded from the ferrite while the field of the backward wave is concentrated within it. This results in a null of the electric field of the <b>forward</b> <b>signal</b> {{on the surface of}} the ferrite where the resistive film is placed.

5000|$|Ephrins {{are divided}} into 2 classes: Ephrin-As are bound to the {{membrane}} through GPI (glycosylphosphatidylinositol) linkage and Ephrin-Bs have a transmembrane domain and a short cytoplasmic domain; they interact with their respective receptors Eph-A and Eph-B which {{are members of the}} tyrosine kinase family. One unusual feature about Ephrins is their ability to bidirectionally signal (...) they can participate in both forward (ligand to receptor) and reverse signaling (receptor to ligand). Eph/Ephrin binding induces conformational changes in the Ephrin transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, activating the signaling pathway. Eph/Ephrin <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> regulates actin dynamics via small GTPases of the Rho family; reverse signaling occurs when the Ephrin-B cytoplasmic tail gets phosphorylated at tyrosine residues. Ephrin-B also contains a PDZ binding motif important in axon guidance regulation via G-protein signaling. Reverse signaling can also occur when Ephrin-A is activated by Eph-A3 binding; this is regulated by metalloprotease-dependent cleavage of Ephrin-A. [...] Eph/Ephrin bidirectional signaling is important for axon guidance and target selection; mapping of retinal axons along anterior-posterior axis in the visual system is regulated by Ephrin-A/Eph-A mediated repulsion. In the tectum, the transcription factor Engrailed creates an Ephrin-A concentration gradient along the anterior-posterior axis; this results in different signaling cues to the growth cones which also express graded levels of the receptor. Interestingly, the topographic location of retinal axons along dorsal-ventral axis requires both forward and reverse signaling by Ephrin-B/Eph-B gradient mediated attraction.|$|E

In this period, time delay of a jammer’s <b>forwarding</b> <b>signal</b> is gradually extended to increase distance between the interference signal and target signal in a range dimension.

40|$|SummaryIn vertebrates, β {{cells are}} {{aggregated}} in the form of pancreatic islets. Within these islets, communication between β cells inhibits basal insulin secretion and enhances glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, thus contributing to glucose homeostasis during fasting and feeding. In {{the search for}} the underlying molecular mechanism, we have discovered that β cells communicate via ephrin-As and EphAs. We provide evidence that ephrin-A 5 is required for glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. We further show that EphA-ephrin-A-mediated β cell communication is bidirectional: EphA <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> inhibits insulin secretion, whereas ephrin-A reverse signaling stimulates insulin secretion. EphA <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> is downregulated in response to glucose, which indicates that, under basal conditions, β cells use EphA <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> to suppress insulin secretion and that, under stimulatory conditions, they shift to ephrin-A reverse signaling to enhance insulin secretion. Thus, we explain how β cell communication in pancreatic islets conversely affects basal and glucose-stimulated insulin secretion to improve glucose homeostasis...|$|E

However, not all axons are myelinated, and the molecular mechanisms involved in guiding the oligodendrocyte processes toward the axons to be myelinated are not well understood. Only a few negative or positive guidance clues {{that are involved in}} regulating axo-glia interaction prior to myelination have been identified. One example is laminin, known to be required for early axo-glia interaction, which functions through a 6 b 1 integrin. Here, we identify the Eph-ephrin family of guidance receptors as novel regulators of the initial axo-glia interaction, preceding myelination. We demonstrate that so-called forward and reverse signaling, mediated by members of both Eph and ephrin subfamilies, has distinct and opposing effects on processes extension and myelin sheet formation. EphA <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> inhibits oligodendrocyte process exten-sion and myelin sheet formation, and blocking of bidirectional signaling through this receptor enhances myelination. Similarly, EphB <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> also reduces myelin membrane formation, but in contrast to EphA <b>forward</b> <b>signaling,</b> this occurs in an integrin-dependent manner, which can be reversed by overexpression of a constitutive active b 1 -integrin. Furthermore, ephrin-B reverse signaling induced by EphA 4 or EphB 1 enhances myelin sheet formation. Combined, this suggests that the Eph-ephrin receptors are important mediators of bidirectional signaling between axons and oligodendrocytes. It further implies that balancing Eph-ephrin forward and reverse signaling is important in the selection process of axons to be myelinated...|$|E

40|$|EphB 4 and its {{cognitive}} ligand ephrinB 2 play {{an important}} role in embryonic vessel development and vascular remodeling. In addition, several reports suggest that this receptor ligand pair is also involved in pathologic vessel formation in adults including tumor angiogenesis. Eph/ephrin signaling is a complex phenomena characterized by receptor <b>forward</b> <b>signaling</b> through the tyrosine kinase of the receptor and ephrin reverse signaling through various protein–protein interaction domains and phosphorylation motifs of the ephrin ligands. Therefore, interfering with EphR/ephrin signaling by the means of targeted gene ablation, soluble receptors, dominant negative mutants or antisense molecules often does not allow to discriminate between inhibition of Eph/ephrin forward and reverse signaling. We developed a specific small molecular weight kinase inhibitor of the EphB 4 kinase, NVP-BHG 712, which inhibits EphB 4 kinase activity in the low nanomolar range in cellular assays showed high selectivity for targeting the EphB 4 kinase when profiled against other kinases in biochemical as well as in cell based assays. Furthermore, NVP-BHG 712 shows excellent pharmacokinetic properties and potently inhibits EphB 4 autophosphorylation in tissues after oral administration. In vivo, NVP-BHG 712 inhibits VEGF driven vessel formation, while it has only little effects on VEGF receptor (VEGFR) activity in vitro or in cellular assays. The data shown here suggest a close cross talk between the VEGFR and EphR signaling during vessel formation.

In this study, forced expression of EphA 5 diminished the expression of osteoblast phenotypic markers.

Based on the transmission protocol performed at relays, we can classify them into two main categories: repetition-based and distributed space-time code-based (DSTC-based) cooperative relay techniques[1]. In repetition-based cooperative relay techniques, each relay, after receiving signal from the source, will consecutively <b>forward</b> the <b>signal</b> to destination. Each transmitted signal (including the original one transmitted from source to destination) is passed through multiple independent paths, and thus, the probability that the signal fails to reach the destination is significantly reduced. In contrast to repetition-based cooperative relay techniques, in DSTC-based cooperative relay techniques, the relays will take advantage of DSTC techniques to simultaneously <b>forward</b> the <b>signal</b> to the destination, and hence, the spectral efficiency of the system is increased. The initial work on using DSTC protocols over relay channel is considered in[1 – 4]. We denote them as the conventional DSTC protocols, in which the whole communication consists of only two phases. Firstly, the source transmits signals to relays and destination. Secondly, the non-regenerative or regenerative relays (NR-relays or R-relays, respectively) use the DSTC protocol to <b>forward</b> <b>signals</b> to the destination.|$|R
