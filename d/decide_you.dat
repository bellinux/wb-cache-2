[...] On 20 November 1887, during a general audience with Leo XIII, Thérèse, in her turn, approached the Pope, knelt, and asked him to allow her to enter Carmel at 15. The Pope said: [...] "Well, my child, do what the superiors <b>decide....</b> <b>You</b> will enter if it is God's Will" [...] and he blessed Thérèse. [...] She refused to leave his feet, and the Swiss Guard had to carry her out of the room.|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{he said at}} length, [...] "the matter seems {{difficult}} to <b>decide.</b> <b>You</b> have two men of excellent character, whom I know something about, and a third who has shown ability in a subordinate post." ...|$|E

I'll turn it over while you are prospecting, and hand it back when you are ready to invest, shall I?' asked Mr Laurie, who had learned wisdom since the days of his own extravagant youth.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Well,' I said to him, 'there's {{no hurry}} about it. Take {{your time and}} think it over. Ata has a very nice room in the annexe. Live with her for a month, and see how you like her. You can have your meals here. And {{at the end of}} a month, if you <b>decide</b> <b>you</b> want to marry her, you can just go and settle down on her property.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, well, I suppose {{what must}} be must be. Not that I have the least {{authority}} to say anything, but I could not help telling the poor fellow thus much--that if he went on steadily {{for a year or}} so, and continued in the same mind, I did not see why he should not ask my brother and Cecily to reconsider it. Then it will be for them to <b>decide,</b> <b>you</b> know.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Perhaps {{the best}} way of meeting the situation,” the captain said curtly, “would be for you to voluntarily leave the ship at Vancouver. You can let me know what <b>you</b> <b>decide</b> when <b>you</b> come off watch.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{said the}} Master; [...] "but {{to do so}} I must find men and carriage. The way is long and rough, and the country infested with wild Indians. Advance me {{only so much as}} shall be needful: either as a lump sum, in lieu of my allowance; or, if you prefer it, as a loan, which I shall repay on my return. And then, if you so <b>decide,</b> <b>you</b> may have seen the last of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For {{the first}} time," [...] I repeated; [...] "and I find them both most {{delightful}} companions. As to how far our acquaintance may progress, that is entirely {{a matter for}} chance to <b>decide.</b> <b>You</b> have doubtless come here with very good motives, but I {{see no reason why}} I should accept your statements concerning Mr. Parker and his daughter. You understand? My suggestion is that you are mistaken. Until I have proved them to be other than they represent themselves to be," [...] I added with infinite subtlety, [...] "I shall continue to derive pleasure from their society." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You r {{good name}} will be {{restored}} to you," [...] he said, [...] "on the day when I make you my wife. The worst enemy you have cannot associate my name with a suspicion of theft. Remember that and think a little before you <b>decide.</b> <b>You</b> see those people there. If you don't change your mind {{by the time they}} have got to the cottage, it's good-by between us, and good-by forever. I refuse to wait for you; I refuse to accept a conditional engagement. Wait, and think. They're walking slowly; you have got some minutes more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then it is <b>decided</b> <b>you</b> {{will return}} to General Herkimer," [...] Colonel Gansevoort said, quickly, as if fearing lest we might repent of our decision. [...] "Tell him that within five minutes after giving the signal we will make a sortie from the main gate in the {{direction}} of Oriskany." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said his}} mother, [...] "I {{think it will}} be best. But lately I <b>decided</b> <b>you</b> had made up your mind to have her, so I said nothing, and should have said nothing. But I say as I have always said, I DON'T think she is suited to you." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It may be {{a couple}} of months before the place is relieved. Of course the {{question}} is, Shall we stay here or go? I don't think we should be of much use here; indeed, I don't see that cavalry would be any good at all, whereas if a portion of the Boers push south we may be very useful in our own line of scouting. Still, this is a question for you to <b>decide.</b> <b>You</b> chose to make me your commander when at work, but we should all have an equal voice in a matter of this sort." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will think}} of it," [...] said he. [...] "I'll see if I can think of any {{conditions}} on which I can allow you to go, and I will {{tell you about it}} at the hotel. And now, in regard to going up to Glasgow. I'll leave it to you and Waldron to <b>decide.</b> <b>You</b> must go and ascertain all the facts--such as how soon the train leaves after we arrive, and how much sooner we shall get up there, if we go in it. Then you must take charge of all the baggage, too, and see that it goes across safe from the steamer to the station, and attend to the whole business." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is, then, {{for you to}} <b>decide.</b> <b>You</b> {{know that}} I wish well to you, and hold you in great esteem, deeming that your visit here will give prosperity, as well as honor, to Tabasco. But there are those among my people who are foolish and headstrong, and who view your coming with suspicion. The priests, too, are unfavorably {{disposed}} towards you, and have long urged that you would make a most acceptable sacrifice to the gods. So far I have withstood them, but I am old and cannot look to live long, and after I have gone your enemies would assuredly have their way. Therefore I think it is for your good that you should go with these merchants." ...|$|E

You know not whether Cortez will retire to the coast and take ship there; or whether he will remain at Tlascala, till {{reinforcements}} arrive from across the sea, and then again advance.

"Now, Miss Asher," [...] {{continued}} Locker, [...] "I have tried, very imperfectly, I know, to {{make you}} see me as I really am, and I do hope you can {{put an end to}} this suspense which is keeping me in a nervous tingle. I can not sleep at night, and all day I am thinking what you will say when you do <b>decide.</b> <b>You</b> need not be afraid to speak out before Miss Raleigh. She is in with us now, and she can't get out. I would not press you for an answer at this moment, but there are reasons which I can not say anything about without meddling with other people's business. But my business with you is the happiness of my life, and I feel that I can not longer endure having it momentarily jeopardized." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And now," [...] said he, [...] "to settle what remains. Will you be wise? {{will you}} be guided? will you suffer me to take this glass {{in my hand and}} to go forth from your house without further parley? or has the greed of curiosity too much command of you?

As you <b>decide,</b> <b>you</b> shall be left as you were before, and neither richer nor wiser, unless the sense of service {{rendered}} to a man in mortal distress may be counted as a kind of riches of the soul. Or, if you shall so prefer to choose, a new province of knowledge and new avenues to fame and power shall be laid open to you, here, in this room, upon the instant; and your sight shall be blasted by a prodigy to stagger the unbelief of Satan." ...|$|E

"If {{you will}} come down," [...] Chigron said, [...] "as soon as it is dark, I will give you {{provisions}} for some days, together with the peasants' dresses I have prepared {{for you and the}} money Ameres committed to my charge. It is not likely that anything will occur to <b>decide</b> <b>you</b> to make a move suddenly, but it is best that you should have everything in readiness for so doing should the occasion possibly arise. I will come up myself to-morrow night if all is well, an hour after sunset. I name the time exactly in order that if you sleep at any distance away you can be here at that hour to meet me; and now I leave you to the protection of the gods. This evening I shall dismantle the chamber you have used and remove all signs of its having been inhabited." ...|$|E
