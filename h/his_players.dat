5|$|Chance was a disciplinarian. He preached {{moderation}} in socializing, including avoiding alcohol, to <b>his</b> <b>players.</b> Chance fined <b>his</b> <b>players</b> for {{shaking hands}} {{with members of the}} opposing team and forced Solly Hofman to delay his wedding until after the baseball season, lest marriage impair his abilities on the playing field. In August 1911, Chance suspended Tinker {{for the remainder of the}} season for using profanity, though he reinstated Tinker two days later.|$|E
5|$|During the half-time interval, a row erupted {{between the}} Birmingham manager {{and some of}} <b>his</b> <b>players</b> about their fitness; in the Manchester City {{dressing}} room, a heated exchange took place between Barnes and Revie. Barnes had played defensively {{in the first half}} to counter the threat of Peter Murphy, but Revie urged him to play further forward. Meanwhile, manager Les McDowall exhorted <b>his</b> <b>players</b> to keep possession and make their opponents chase the ball.|$|E
5|$|Although Woodfull was {{a devout}} Methodist, {{he would show}} a deep concern in the {{personal}} welfare of all players, which extended to finding {{the location of the}} nearest Catholic Church for those teammates who followed the religion. At the time, Australian society at large was divided along Catholic-Protestant lines, and while O'Reilly and McCabe were full of praise for Woodfull, they were later accused of leading a Catholic revolt against the leadership of the Protestant Bradman during a divisive period in the late-1930s. While Woodfull himself never touched alcohol due to his strict adherence to his religious principles, he did not impose his beliefs on his team. He would buy drinks for <b>his</b> <b>players,</b> and ask administrators to provide more alcohol for his teammates when they were exhausted. At the time, cricketers widely regarded beer as a highly effective means of rehydration, and on one occasion Woodfull threatened to halt play when administrators refused <b>his</b> <b>players</b> more ale {{on the grounds that they}} had already consumed their quota.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the team}} was {{considered}} successful, {{in spite of the}} failure to recapture The Ashes, the problems between the players and the administrators continued. Before the team departed Australia, the players arbitrarily replaced one of the selected players without recourse to the ACC. After the final match in England, Trott and <b>his</b> <b>players</b> broke an agreement to return home in time for the 1896–97 Australian season. Instead, they organised matches in North America and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Brown sat <b>his</b> <b>players</b> down in {{classrooms}} and relentlessly tested {{them on their}} knowledge of the playbook, requiring them to copy down every play in a separate notebook for better retention. He was a terse man, and his criticisms of players were often withering and ruthless. He prohibited players from drinking, told them not to smoke in public and made coats and ties mandatory on road trips. They were not to have sex after Tuesday night during the season.|$|E
5|$|By June 1999 and in {{the midst}} of their investigation, the {{university}} had negotiated a buyout of the remainder of Haskins' contract, worth $1.5 million over three years. It also withdrew from postseason consideration in the 1999–2000 season and docked itself 11 scholarships over four years. In the summer of 2000, Haskins came forward and admitted that he had paid Gangelhoff $3,000 for her services; this revelation came to light after Haskins turned his financial records over to the NCAA. In addition, more details were emerging in which Haskins was also accused of mail fraud in an incident regarding a recruit's transcript, giving players cash, dismissing sexual harassment concerns against <b>his</b> <b>players,</b> as well as his staff trying to persuade professors to give <b>his</b> <b>players</b> inflated grades they had not earned.|$|E

5|$|Despite his fierce nature, Auerbach {{was popular}} among <b>his</b> <b>players.</b> He {{recalled}} that on his 75th birthday party, 45 {{of his former}} players showed up; and when he turned 80, his perennial 1960s victim Wilt Chamberlain showed up, a gesture which Auerbach dearly appreciated.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson died in Brooklyn of {{apoplexy}} {{at the age}} of 49. Initially {{buried in}} the Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, he was later reinterred in Cypress Hills Cemetery, also in the borough of Brooklyn. Despite his career that was filled with incidents of turmoil between him and <b>his</b> <b>players</b> and other baseball people, his funeral, which was held at his home, was quickly crowded, as was the front stoop. Eventually, they had to turn people away.|$|E
5|$|In 1967, Ward {{returned}} to his alma mater to take the head coaching position. Before the season, 12 players failed to academically qualify {{to play on the}} team. During that first season, the team lost all nine of their games {{for the first time in}} the modern era. Ward's second year saw slight improvement, recording eight losses but with wins over North Carolina and South Carolina. However, many of <b>his</b> <b>players</b> were growing increasingly disgruntled with his coaching style.|$|E

5|$|In the season's final game, Tech {{defeated}} the Auburn Tigers 68–7. Coach Mike Donahue's Tigers had lost only to Davidson in an upset, and held undefeated Big Ten champion Ohio State to a scoreless tie {{less than a}} week before the Tech game. Ohio State, led by Chic Harley, had been favored 4 or 5 to 1. Coach Heisman (who previously coached at Auburn) and <b>his</b> <b>players</b> were at the game, rooting for the Tigers.|$|E
5|$|Initially, coach Simpson was not informed; when {{he found}} out, he was angry that the ACB had not trusted him enough {{to tell him what}} <b>his</b> <b>players</b> had done. Captain Mark Taylor was also aware of the issue by the time he took the team to the West Indies, as were vice-captain Ian Healy and Waugh's brother Steve.|$|E
5|$|Muntz {{attempted}} {{to establish a}} modern, trendy image for <b>his</b> <b>players</b> and cartridges. His print advertisements often showed the player installed in an appealing sports car and usually incorporated a young, attractive model with a suggestive tagline.

In response, Tech head coach Frank Beamer ushered Short to the local Greyhound bus depot and put the player on a bus {{to his home in}} Richmond. The move was part of Beamer's attempt to keep <b>his</b> <b>players</b> focused on the {{upcoming}} game and not be distracted by the attractions of New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the cup final, Napoli were {{in third}} place in Serie A and {{therefore}} in the last position {{to qualify for the}} Champions League, eight points ahead of Fiorentina with nine points left to play for. Fiorentina manager Vincenzo Montella said before the game that his priority was to finish fourth and win the Coppa Italia. His Napoli counterpart, Rafael Benítez, warned <b>his</b> <b>players</b> not to expect to win solely based on their league position.|$|E
5|$|The family {{atmosphere}} Revie instilled at Elland Road {{ensured that}} many Leeds United players remained firm friends and fiercely loyal to Revie long after their playing days had ended; <b>his</b> <b>players</b> also generally avoided financial, addiction or family problems, enjoying largely stable lives even after retirement. In May 2012, {{a statue of}} Revie was unveiled outside Elland Road. The North Stand of Elland Road is formally known as the Revie Stand.|$|E

United manager Sir Alex Ferguson, on the other hand, believed the defeat highlighted <b>his</b> <b>players</b> needed more game time.|$|E
5|$|With professionalism legalised, Preston flourished. Keen to {{make use}} of tactics, Sudell {{was the first person to}} use a {{blackboard}} to dictate positions and strategy to <b>his</b> <b>players.</b> In 1887, Preston recorded the biggest win in the history of the FA Cup, beating Hyde 26–0 in the first round. The club progressed to the final having amassed a run of 42 consecutive wins in all competitions, but were beaten in the FA Cup Final by West Bromwich Albion.|$|E
5|$|After the 1913 season, Evers {{was offered}} $100,000 ($ in current dollar terms) {{to jump to}} the Federal League, but he opted to take less money to remain with the Cubs. In February 1914, after Evers signed <b>his</b> <b>players</b> to contracts, Murphy fired Evers as manager and traded him to the Boston Braves for Bill Sweeney and Hub Perdue. Murphy insisted that Evers had {{resigned}} as manager, which Evers denied. Evers insisted he was a free agent, but the league assigned him to the Braves. He signed a four-year contract at $10,000 per season ($ in current dollar terms), with a $20,000 signing bonus.|$|E
