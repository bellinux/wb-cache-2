500|$|According to Kubrick's {{brother-in-law}} Jan Harlan, {{the director}} was adamant the trims were {{never to be}} seen, and that he burned the negatives, which he had kept in his garage, shortly before his death. This was confirmed by former Kubrick assistant Leon Vitali: [...] "I'll tell you right now, okay, on Clockwork Orange, The Shining, Barry Lyndon, some little parts of 2001, we had thousands of cans of negative outtakes and print, which we had stored in an area at his house where we worked out of, which he personally supervised the loading of it to a truck and then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> a big industrial waste lot and burned it. That's what he wanted." ...|$|E

2500|$|Soon {{afterward}} I {{resolved to}} visit my town of Taal; nothing was left of it except {{the walls of the}} church and convento. All the rest, the government house, the walks of the rope factory, the warehouse, everything was buried beneath a layer of stones, mud, and ashes more than 10 spans [...] thick; only here and there could be seen an upright post, the only remnant of a comfortable dwelling. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> the river and found it completely filled up, with a boat belonging to the alcalde and many of private persons buried in the mud. After incredible efforts I finally succeeded in unearthing in what had once been the church and sacristy, the chests which contained the sacred vestments and vessels. Nearly all of them were demolished by the rocks and beams which had fallen upon them, and filled with foul-smelling mud that had ruined or disfigured their contents. With the aid of some natives of Bauang, I likewise recovered some property from among the ruins of the convento.|$|E

Clanton testified later that he saw Virgil take his six-shooter out of his lap and stick it in his pants when the game ended. Not having rented a room, McLaury and Clanton {{had no place to}} go. Shortly after 8:00 am barkeeper E. F. Boyle spoke to Clanton, who had been {{drinking}} all night, in front of the telegraph office. Boyle encouraged him to get some sleep, but Clanton insisted he would not go to bed. Boyle later testified he noticed Clanton was armed and covered his gun for him, recalling that Clanton told him [...] "'As soon as the Earps and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street, the ball would open—that they would have to fight'... <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> Wyatt Earp's house and told him that Ike Clanton had threatened that when him and his brothers and Doc Holliday showed themselves on the street that the ball would open."
