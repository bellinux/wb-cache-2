40|$|AbstractThe {{pros and}} cons of various types of biomass dryers have been {{documented}} in this paper. Using dry biomass significantly reduces the cost of handling, transportation and pyrolysis. The main choices for drying biomass are rotary <b>dryers,</b> <b>flash</b> <b>dryers,</b> stationery bed dryers and fluidised bed dryers. The drying medium can be hot air, hot air mixed with steam, and/or superheated steam. A typical example for wood chip drying using a financial model is described, including the environmental performance. The energy requirements and greenhouse gas emissions have been estimated for drying biomass. From this study, it is evident that increasing temperature will decrease drying time and increase throughput but not necessarily decrease the drying cost. This is due to higher energy use and higher cost of capital inputs such as loading/unloading and heat plant. Thus, low drying temperature can be used if throughput is not a key issue for an operation. The global warming potential of the biomass drying process 9. 2 kg CO 2 -e/t of oven-dry biomass. This assumes that wood waste is used as fuel and drying is on a moving belt dryer. If this dry biomass is used in a power station as fuel for steam boiler, there is a significant reduction potential of CO 2 emission from a typical black coal-fired power plant due to fuel switching. This assumes that trees are planted to produce this biomass sustainably. Environmental impacts of any dryer type should be considered for selection in addition to its traditional techno-economic performance...|$|R

For members of the rice {{industry}} this wet season harvest poses a problem: grain cannot be dried reliably using traditional sundrying methods. Poor drying results in quality reductions and hence farmers receive lower returns. To address this situation the Philippines Government introduced locally manufactured mechanical dryers. This study was undertaken to examine variables which enhance or limit the continued use of the mobile <b>flash</b> <b>dryers</b> in farmers' co-operatives in Nueva Ecija, the Philippines. Two case studies, each consisting of three farmers' co-operatives were investigated using semi-structured interviews. One case comprised co-operatives that continue to use the dryer while the other comprised those that have stopped using it. Results showed that a combination of factors influenced the adoption decisions of the co-operatives. Economic factors, especially the volume of rice handled by the co-operative appeared to be most important. Furthermore, the way that the dryer fitted with the other postharvest systems in the co-operatives was a determinant of adoption decisions. In particular, the co-operatives with rice milling operations or with inadequate alternative drying options utilised the mechanical dryers. The leadership and management of the co- operative appeared also to be a factor. These results indicate that both organisational factors and the characteristics of a technology need to be considered in the development and extension of innovation. Overall the results of this work support the individual and organisational adoption literature. Further work could explore this issue on a wider basis across more co-operatives within the region and across more regions in the country.

40|$|Cogeneration in the Australian sugar {{industry}} {{has the potential}} to provide significant environmental and economic benefits. Central to increasing cogenerated energy output is the use of bagasse drying to improve boiler efficiency. In a previous numerical study, pre-drying of bagasse from 50 % moisture to 30 % moisture using waste flue gas was shown to deliver up to 16 % reduction in bagasse usage and up to 24 % increase in specific steam production. Across the world both flighted rotary <b>dryers</b> and <b>flash</b> <b>dryers</b> have been used to dry bagasse fibre for enhanced boiler operation. In this paper, the design and preliminary costing of a flighted rotary dryer processing 50 t/h of Burdekin bagasse fibre from 50 % moisture to 38 % moisture using waste flue gas is described. Operational scenarios, such as the effect of varying flue gas temperature on dryer design, are evaluated. Key design data such as the drying rate and bagasse angle of repose were determined by experiments using a Spencer oven and pilot scale rotary dryer, respectively. The development and use of a multi-scale compartment model for sizing the dryer is described. In this model, the impact of flight and drum geometry on dryer loading and dryer design were directly accounted for. The results of this investigation showed that both energy and material costs of a dryer are highly dependent on the loading state and material properties such as angle of repose and bulk density. A new design methodology which used simulated trails with variable dryer loading states showed a distinct minimum in costs occurring {{at the point where the}} particular dryer was operating closest to its design loading. The optimum flighted rotary bagasse dryer design was found by minimising total cost (electrical energy and raw material requirements), and was shown to occur at design loading. Although the results presented in this work relate to a fixed set of operating conditions, it is likely that the methodology used and conclusions drawn can be applied to the general design and operation of flighted rotary dryers...|$|R

The process to obtain powder or corn flour from NCK was as follows: (i) the NCK with different STs were wet-milled in a stone mill, (ii) dehydrated by a <b>Flash</b> type <b>dryer,</b> and (iii) pulverized with a hammer mill and sieved with a 20 mesh. The powder was characterized by measuring the PSD percentage, calcium percentage (CP), peak viscosity at 90 °C (PV), and crystallinity percentage (CP). The PSD of the powder as a function of ST was determined by sieving in Ro-TAP equipment. By sieving, five fractions of powder were obtained employing meshes 30, 40, 60, 80, and 100. The final weight of the PSD obtained from the sieving process follows a Gaussian profile with the maximum corresponding to the average particle obtained with mesh 60. The calcium percentage as a function of ST follows a behavior similar to the weight of the PSD. The study of crystallinity versus the mesh number shows that it decreases for smaller mesh number. A similar behavior is observed as steeping time increases, except around ST = 8 [*]h where the gelatinization of starch is observed. The trend of increasing viscosity values of the powder samples occurs when increasing ST and decreasing particle size. The ST significantly changes the crystallinity and viscosity values of the powder and, in both cases, a minimum value is observed in the region 7 – 9 [*]h.

Soymilk residue, also known as okara, was provided by a Brazilian soymilk factory. RSM showed that for a 120 second drying cycle, the lower the residue moisture contents (y) obtained, the higher the recirculation rates (x 1), regardless of the air drying temperature (x 2), and it could be expressed by the equation y = 7. 072 - 7. 92 x 1, with R² = 92, 92 %.

A pilot scale <b>flash</b> <b>dryer</b> was designed and fabricated to examine the effect of hot air temperature and velocity on the drying behavior of coir pith. Hot air drying was carried out to examine the drying kinetics by allowing the coir pith particles to fluidize and circulate inside the drying chamber. The physico-chemical properties of volume expansion ratio (VE), water retention capacity (WRC), bulk density, pH and electrical conductivity (EC) of compressed coir pith discs were measured. Scanning electron microscopy was used to analyze the microstructures of dried coir pith. The results were compared with the two other drying techniques namely sun drying and oven drying. The effect of time duration for retting and the method of retting the coconut husk were also examined. The optimum temperature for coir pith drying was found to be 140 C. The most suitable range of particle size and the range of moisture content in dried coir pith were identified as 0. 5 – 6. 3 mm and 12 - 23 % (w/w, dry basis) respectively. The VE, WRC, pH and EC of coir pith dried in the <b>flash</b> <b>dryer</b> at the optimum temperature of 140 C was found to be 5. 01 ± 0. 21, 4. 02 ± 0. 10 (w/w), 5. 95 ± 0. 08 and 330 ± 16 μs/cm respectively. These values were comparable with those of the sundried coir pith. Oven drying caused rupturing the cells and case hardening of coir pith. Similar effect was observed with temperatures > 140 C for hot air drying and flash drying. VE and WRC of coco discs were found to increase significantly, pH to change marginally and EC to drop significantly with the increase of retting time. The effective moisture diffusivity was found to increase from 1. 18 × 10 - 8 to 1. 37 × 10 - 8 m 2 /s with the increase of hot air velocity from 1. 4 to 2. 5 m/s respectively.

40|$|Abstract – The Nkana smelter was {{initially}} commissioned in 1931, with two reverberatory furnaces, two Peirce-Smith converters, and blister copper casting facilities. Reverberatory furnaces were {{the mainstay of}} production up until 1994, when an El Teniente Converter (CT) was installed to upgrade reverberatory furnace matte to white metal, prior to converting in conventional Peirce-Smith (PS) converters. In 2000, a decision was taken to increase the proportion of concentrate smelted in the CT by introduction of bone-dry concentrate injection through the tuyeres. A <b>flash</b> <b>dryer</b> with a nominal capacity of 1 200 metric tons per day of dry product, and associated tuyere injection system was commissioned in March 2004. Based on the projected concentrate arisings from the KCM mines into the future, as seen in 2004, {{it was decided to}} develop the CT to be the primary smelting vessel at Nkana, to handle a minimum of 1 250 tons per day of concentrate, and to operate only one reverberatory furnace in slag-cleaning mode pending a full evaluation of alternative slag-cleaning technologies. The anticipated cathode production from Nkana was to be in the range 140 to 150 000 tons per annum. This paper details the outcomes from trials that were carried out in August and September 2004, using two reverberatory furnaces for slag cleaning. The results of these trials, plus further work in October and November, provided confidence to move to one reverberatory furnace for slag cleaning in December 2004. With the advent of Vedanta as the majority shareholder in KCM at the end of 2004, the approach has been to maximize the available smelting capacity. Currently, two reverberatory furnaces and the CT are on-line, with the higher silica concentrates going to the reverberatory furnaces with an appropriate amount of pyrite, and the cleaner concentrates going to the CT.

40|$|By {{replacing}} coal with renewable fuels, such as wood, {{the consumption}} of coal {{and the amount of}} fossil fuel emissions can be reduced. The wood fuels need however processing before combustion in pulverized fuel firing boilers. The aim of this work is to study the applicability of the DustComb-process as a pretreatment method for wood fuels. The principle of the DustComb-process is to defibrate the woody feedstock with a mechanical defibrator, and the produced fines are dried with a <b>flash</b> <b>dryer</b> integrated into the process. The dried fines are either fed into a pulverized fuel burner or stored for later use. In this work, the co-firing of biomass in a pulverized coal boiler is discussed, and the principles of mechanical defibration and flash drying are explained. In the experimental part of this study, the influence of the disc clearance on the defibrator’s specific energy consumption is determined. The disc clearance in the defibration tests are varied between 0. 60 and 1. 80 mm. Also the effect of the particle size on the drying rate is studied. In the calculations part, the costs of producing the DustComb-fuel are estimated and their dependence on the market price of electricity, the price of heat, and the price of the feedstock are evaluated. The costs are further compared with the market prices of coal and wood pellets. The experimental results show that the energy consumption of the defibration starts to increase rapidly when the disc clearance is narrowed from 1. 00 mm. According to the test results, the studied particle size changes do not have any remarkable effect on the drying rate of the material. A significant observation is that a great amount of the wa-ter in the wood is evaporated already during the defibration (16 – 25 % of the initial moisture). The calculation results show that the production of the DustComb-fuel is economically viable when compared to the price of coal, and especially when com-pared to the price of wood pellets. The results also show that the costs of the energy needed for the DustComb-process are low compared to the price of the raw material...|$|E
40|$|Given that {{fossil fuel}} fired power plants {{are among the}} largest and most {{concentrated}} producers of CO{sub 2 } emissions, recovery and sequestration of CO{sub 2 } from the flue gas of such plants has been identified as one of the primary means for reducing anthropogenic (i. e., man-made) CO{sub 2 } emissions. In 2001, ALSTOM Power Inc. (ALSTOM) began a two-phase program to investigate the feasibility of various carbon capture technologies. This program was sponsored under a Cooperative Agreement from the US Department of Energy's National Energy Technology Laboratory (DOE). The first phase entailed a comprehensive study evaluating the technical feasibility and economics of alternate CO{sub 2 } capture technologies applied to Greenfield US coal-fired electric generation power plants. Thirteen cases, representing various levels of technology development, were evaluated. Seven cases represented coal combustion in CFB type equipment. Four cases represented Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) systems. Two cases represented advanced Chemical Looping Combined Cycle systems. Marion, et al. reported the details of this work in 2003. One of the thirteen cases studied utilized an oxygen-fired circulating fluidized bed (CFB) boiler. In this concept, the fuel is fired with a mixture of oxygen and recirculated flue gas (mainly CO{sub 2 }). This combustion process yields a flue gas containing over 80 percent (by volume) CO{sub 2 }. This flue gas can be processed relatively easily to enrich the CO{sub 2 } content to over 96 percent for use in enhanced oil or gas recovery (EOR or EGR) or simply dried for sequestration. The Phase I study identified the O{sub 2 }-fired CFB as having a near term development potential, because it uses conventional commercial CFB technology and commercially available CO{sub 2 } capture enabling technologies such as cryogenic air separation and simple rectification or distillation gas processing systems. In the long term, air separation technology advancements offer significant reductions in power requirements, which would improve plant efficiency and economics for the oxygen-fired technology. The second phase consisted of pilot-scale testing followed by a refined performance and economic evaluation of the O{sub 2 } fired CFB concept. As a part of this workscope, ALSTOM modified its 3 MW{sub th} (9. 9 MMBtu/hr) Multiuse Test Facility (MTF) pilot plant to operate with O{sub 2 }/CO{sub 2 } mixtures of up to 70 percent O{sub 2 } by volume. Tests were conducted with coal and petroleum coke. The test objectives were to determine the impacts of oxygen firing on heat transfer, bed dynamics, potential agglomeration, and gaseous and particulate emissions. The test data results were used to refine the design, performance, costs, and economic models developed in Phase-I for the O{sub 2 }-fired CFB with CO{sub 2 } capture. Nsakala, Liljedahl, and Turek reported results from this study in 2004. ALSTOM identified several items needing further investigation in preparation for large scale demonstration of the oxygen-fired CFB concept, namely: (1) Operation and performance of the moving bed heat exchanger (MBHE) to avoid recarbonation and also for cost savings compared to the standard bubbling fluid bed heat exchanger (FBHE); (2) Performance of the back-end <b>flash</b> <b>dryer</b> absorber (FDA) for sulfur capture under high CO{sub 2 }/high moisture flue gas environment using calcined limestone in the fly ash and using fresh commercial lime directly in the FDA; (3) Determination of the effect of recarbonation on fouling in the convective pass; (4) Assessment of the impact of oxygen firing on the mercury, other trace elements, and volatile organic compound (VOC) emissions; and (5) Develop a proposal-level oxygen-fired retrofit design for a relatively small existing CFB steam power plant in preparation for a large-scale demonstration of the O{sub 2 } fired CFB concept. Hence, ALSTOM responded to a DOE Solicitation to address all these issues with further O{sub 2 } fired MTF pilot testing and a subsequent retrofit design study of oxygen firing and CO{sub 2 } capture on an existing air-fired CFB plant. ALSTOM received a contract award from the DOE to conduct a project entitled 'Commercialization Development of Oxygen Fired CFB for Greenhouse Gas Control', under Cooperative Agreement DE-FC 26 - 04 NT 42205 {{that is the subject of}} this topical report...|$|E
