40|$|Abstract- Optical fibers are {{structures}} that are typically designed to transmit energy along a specified trajectory with minimal attenuation and single distortion. Optical fibers with small losses appeared in 1970. This event has {{laid the foundation}} for modern optical communication industry. However Si waveguides have some nonlinearity which occurs when electromagnetic waves interact with core ofthe waveguide. To do away with this problem it was begun to use Optical fibers with <b>helical</b> <b>winding</b> known as complex optical waveguides. Also in conventional waveguide modes are mixed with adjacent mode if V number is greater than 2. 405. The use of <b>helical</b> <b>winding</b> in optical fibers makes the analysis much accurate. As the number of propagating modes depends on the helix pitch angle, so <b>helical</b> <b>winding</b> at core-cladding interface can control the dispersion or propagation characteristics ofthe optical waveguide. The model dispersion characteristics of circular optical waveguide with <b>helical</b> <b>winding</b> at core-cladding interface are obtained for different pitch angle. This paper gives the idea to obtain dispersion characteristics, and comparison of dispersion characteristics at different pitch angles. We obtained the dispersion characteristics by using boundary condition and this condition have been utilized to get the model Eigen values equation. From these Eigen value equations dispersion curve are obtained and plotted for five particular values of the pitch angle of the winding. Also fractional power flow in core and cladding has been calculated and the result has been compared.

40|$|Helical {{windings}} (or zig-zag windings) {{are used}} {{in a number of}} applications, however in electrical machines mainly employed in low-power, high-speed PM brushless DC machines due to the cost-effectiveness of the winding type while maintaining reasonable performance. Typically, <b>helical</b> <b>winding</b> are used for low voltage applications due to their spiral form, which makes them most suitable for a small number of turns. In high-speed electrical machines such a low number of turns is applicable. It is apparent that high-speed PM machines suffer from rotor eddy-current losses, which in some cases may lead to PM demagnetization due to overheating.

40|$|INTRODUCTION Left {{ventricular}} (LV) microstructure is unique, {{composed of}} a <b>winding</b> <b>helical</b> pattern of myocytes and rotating aggregations of myocytes called sheetlets. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a cardiovascular disease characterised by left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), however the link between LVH and underlying microstructural aberration is poorly understood. In vivo cardiovascular diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) is a novel cardiovascular MRI (CMR) technique, capable of characterising LV microstructural dynamics non-invasively. In vivo cDTI may therefore improve our understanding microstructural-functional relationships in health and disease. METHODS AND RESULTS The monopolar diffusion weighted stimulated echo acquisition mode (DW-STEAM) sequence was evaluated for in vivo cDTI acquisitions at 3 Tesla, in healthy volunteers (HV), patients with hypertensive LVH, and HCM patients. Results were contextualised in relation to extensively explored technical limitations. cDTI parameters demonstrated good intra-centre reproducibility in HCM, and good inter-centre reproducibility in HV. In all subjects, cDTI was able to depict the <b>winding</b> <b>helical</b> pattern of myocyte orientation known from histology, and the transmural rate of change in myocyte orientation was dependent on LV size and thickness. In HV, comparison of cDTI parameters between systole and diastole revealed an increase in transmural gradient, combined with a significant re-orientation of sheetlet angle. In contrast, in HCM, myocyte gradient increased between phases, however sheetlet angulation retained a systolic-like orientation in both phases. Combined analysis with hypertensive patients revealed a proportional decrease in sheetlet mobility with increasing LVH. CONCLUSION In vivo DW-STEAM cDTI can characterise LV microstructural dynamics non-invasively. The transmural rate of change in myocyte angulation is dependent on LV size and wall thickness, however inter phase changes in myocyte orientation are unaffected by LVH. In contrast, sheetlet dynamics demonstrate increasing dysfunction, {{in proportion to the}} degree of LVH. Resolving technical limitations is key to advancing this technique, and improving the understanding of the role of microstructural abnormalities in cardiovascular disease expression.
