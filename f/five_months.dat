40|$|Background: Reporting {{templates}} {{are increasingly}} common in all fields of pathology. In this paper, we present {{an assessment of}} the impact of a thyroid fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) template on diagnostic classification and cytohistologic concordance. Materials and Methods: A thyroid FNAC reporting template was developed and introduced at a university teaching hospital. We examined FNAC reports for a five-month period before introduction of the template and compared these to the <b>five</b> <b>month</b> period after the template introduction. We recorded diagnostic categorization as well as cytohistologic correlation. Results: A total of 168 cases were identified in the <b>five</b> <b>month</b> period prior to the introduction of the reporting template and 172 cases in the <b>five</b> <b>month</b> period after the introduction of the reporting template. The template appeared to improve the diagnostic precision of benign conditions without altering the proportion of cases classified as unsatisfactory, benign or abnormal. There {{was no significant difference in}} the rate of cytohistologic concordance before and after the template introduction. Conclusions: The introduction of a reporting template for thyroid FNAC improved diagnostic precision of benign conditions and did not alter the general diagnostic classification or cytohistologic concordance...|$|R
