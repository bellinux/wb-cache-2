5|$|Many of the {{arguments}} proposed in favor of non-violence to animals refer to the bliss one feels, the rewards <b>it</b> <b>entails</b> before or after death, the danger and harm it prevents, {{as well as to}} the karmic consequences of violence.|$|E
5|$|O'Regan {{said that}} Australian players were not {{prepared}} for playing cricket in Asia, as they {{were not aware of}} the dangers of bookmakers and betting on the Indian subcontinent. He recommended that every new player should be warned of the dangers of becoming involved with bookmakers, and the penalties that <b>it</b> <b>entails.</b> The ICC announced that no further action would be taken against Waugh and Warne as they could not be tried twice for the same offence.|$|E
5|$|Hirschman {{believed}} that Nurkse's balanced growth theory wasn't {{in fact a}} theory of growth. Growth implies the gradual transformation of an economy from one stage to the chronologically next stage. <b>It</b> <b>entails</b> the series of actions which leads the economy from a stage of infancy to that of maturity. However, the balanced growth theory involves {{the creation of a}} brand new, self-sufficient modern industrial economy being laid over a stagnant, self-sufficient traditional economy. Thus, there is no transformation. In reality, a dual economy will come into existence, where two separate economic sectors will begin to coexist in one country. They will differ on levels of development, technology and demand patterns. This may create inequality in the country.|$|E

50|$|The {{first major}} study of Adventists begun in 1960, {{has become known}} as the Adventist Mortality Study. Consisting of 22,940 California Adventists, <b>it</b> <b>entailed</b> an {{intensive}} 5-year follow-up and a more informal 25-year follow-up.|$|R
5|$|In {{his paper}} The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories, philosopher Michael Stocker {{challenges}} Kantian ethics (and all modern ethical theories) {{by arguing that}} actions from duty lack certain moral value. He gives the example of Smith, who visits his friend in hospital out of duty, rather than because of the friendship; he argues that this visit seems morally lacking because it is motivated by the wrong thing. Marcia Baron has attempted to defend Kantian ethics on this point. After presenting {{a number of reasons}} that we might find acting out of duty objectionable, she argues that these problems only arise when people misconstrue what their duty is. Acting out of duty is not intrinsically wrong, but immoral consequences can occur when people misunderstand what they are duty-bound to do. Duty need not be seen as cold and impersonal: one may have a duty to cultivate their character or improve their personal relationships. Baron further argues that duty should be construed as a secondary motive—that is, a motive that regulates and sets conditions on what may be done, rather than prompt specific actions. She argues that, seen this way, duty neither reveals a deficiency in one's natural inclinations to act, nor undermines the motives and feelings that are essential to friendship. For Baron, being governed by duty does not mean that duty is always the primary motivation to act; rather, <b>it</b> <b>entails</b> that considerations of duty are always action-guiding. A responsible moral agent should take an interest in moral questions, such as questions of character. These should guide moral agents to act from duty.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>entails</b> a {{recognition}} {{and support of}} the co-existence of multiple languages within society.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>entails</b> the {{adoption}} of a non-indigenous language as an official language. The Singapore government adopted a non-indigenous language, English, to exist alongside the indigenous languages of Singapore.|$|E
50|$|Sound-sample extraction: a hand-controlled {{method that}} {{required}} delicate manipulation {{to get a}} clean sample of sound. <b>It</b> <b>entailed</b> letting the stylus read a small segment of a record. Used in the Symphonie pour un homme seul.|$|R
60|$|In {{all this}} Julius II was most fully justified. The odious matter in his conduct, however, is the abominable treachery <b>it</b> <b>entailed,</b> {{following}} as <b>it</b> did upon the undertaking {{by virtue of}} which he gained the tiara.|$|R
60|$|It {{was not a}} {{pleasant}} task to Alison, for <b>it</b> <b>entailed</b> the mention of her father's death and {{an account of the}} difficulties that had followed, but she spoke for a few minutes, and her companion casually expressed her sympathy.|$|R
25|$|Many of the {{arguments}} proposed in favor of non-violence to animals refer to the bliss one feels, the rewards <b>it</b> <b>entails</b> before or after death, the danger and harm it prevents, {{as well as to}} the karmic consequences of violence.|$|E
25|$|RHR {{opposes the}} {{construction}} of the Israeli West Bank barrier in any place where <b>it</b> <b>entails</b> the expropriation of Arab-owned land, the division of villages, or cutting farmers off from their fields. RHR achieved a major victory in 2006 when it won a lawsuit to prevent the division by the fence of the village of Sheikh Sa'ad.|$|E
25|$|In February 2007, ENEE {{initiated}} {{program to}} reduce arrears and commercial losses {{under the heading}} Operación Tijera (Operation “Scissor”). <b>It</b> <b>entails</b> coordinated action from all Ministries and government agencies aiming to cut service (a) to delinquent clients, and (b) to any users detected during the operation with irregular service connections or with meters that had been tampered with. According to press reports, the operation {{has led to an}} instantaneous increase in collections.|$|E
30|$|The {{synthesis}} of analogues of natural compounds {{was the next}} step in the development of new materials for the dyeing industry. Alizarin was the first dye whose structure was determined, thus enabling its synthesis in 1868. The first {{synthesis of}} alizarin was patented by Graebe and Liebermann and was a milestone in the industrial production of dyes and pigments [8, 9]. <b>It</b> <b>entailed</b> the di-bromination of anthraquinone, followed by fusion with sodium hydroxide. The second, much cheaper, synthetic path was developed in 1869 by Graebe, Liebermann and Caro and independently by Perkin in the same year. <b>It</b> <b>entailed</b> the treatment of anthraquinone with fuming sulphuric acid, followed by a treatment with sodium hydroxide and potassium chlorate.|$|R
50|$|The Free Breakfast Table was {{the demand}} of British working-class Liberalism from the 1860s {{to the early}} twentieth-century. <b>It</b> <b>entailed</b> abolishing duties on basic {{foodstuffs}} as these were indirect taxes and therefore regressive. It was {{as a result of}} the abolition of Protectionism.|$|R
60|$|As {{the full}} {{possibilities}} of his devilish scheme unfolded before his mind's eye a grim smile curled his straight, thin lips {{at the thought}} of the fate which <b>it</b> <b>entailed</b> for the creator of the hideous monsters of the court of mystery.|$|R
25|$|A {{defining}} {{feature of}} the venues Rabinow has called for and worked on is collaboration. Understood {{as a mode of}} work, Rabinow defines collaboration in distinction to cooperation. A cooperative mode of work consists in “demarcated tasking on distinct problems and objects, with occasional if regular exchange.” Cooperation does not entail either a common definition of problems or shared techniques of remediation. A collaborative mode of work, by contrast, proceeds from an interdependent division of labor on shared problems. <b>It</b> <b>entails</b> a common definition of problems (or acceptance of a problem-space).|$|E
25|$|The {{phenomenon}} of spirit possession {{has been documented}} in modern Rajasthan. Some of the spirits that are claimed to possess Rajasthanis are seen as good and beneficial while others are seen as malevolent. The good spirits include murdered royalty, the underworld god Bhaironji, and Muslim saints. Bad spirits include perpetual debtors who die in debt, stillborn infants, deceased widows, and foreign tourists. The possessed individual {{is referred to as}} a ghorala ("mount"). Possession, even if it is by a benign spirit, is regarded as undesirable, as <b>it</b> <b>entails</b> loss of self-control and violent emotional outbursts.|$|E
25|$|Likewise Isenkrahe's {{violation}} of the energy conservation law is unacceptable, and Kelvin's application of Clausius' theorem leads (as noted by Kelvin himself) {{to some sort of}} perpetual motion mechanism. The suggestion of a secondary re-radiation mechanism for wave models attracted the interest of JJ Thomson, but was not taken very seriously by either Maxwell or Poincaré, because <b>it</b> <b>entails</b> a gross {{violation of}} the second law of thermodynamics (huge amounts of energy spontaneously being converted from a colder to a hotter form), {{which is one of the}} most solidly established of all physical laws.|$|E
40|$|Technological advances, e. g., smartphones, facial recognition, clickstream analyses, etc. are {{delivering}} unprecedented conveniences and revolutionizing {{the way we}} shop. What does <b>it</b> <b>entail</b> {{to deliver}} these technology-driven shopping wonders? Should we be worried about retailers probably knowing more about us than we know about ourselves...|$|R
5000|$|Mass {{immigration}} {{is a relatively}} recent phenomenon in Norway, starting for real with the influx of Pakistani migrant workers in the 1970s. The Intercultural Museum was established {{as a response to}} the immigration and the cultural changes <b>it</b> <b>entailed.</b> <b>It</b> has received much attention for its pioneer work with the new minority groups in Norway. In 2006, it was selected as [...] "Museum of the Year" [...] by the Norwegian Museums Association.|$|R
2500|$|When Frondizi {{implemented}} a proposed World Bank project endorsed by Alsogaray, <b>it</b> <b>entailed</b> {{the closure of}} {{a third of the}} nation's 47,000km (29,000mi) of track, the disposal of 70,000 train cars/wagons, and laying off many workers. (This resulted in a six-week strike in the critical sector in 1961.) ...|$|R
25|$|The {{evolution}} {{of different types}} of sleep patterns is influenced by a number of selective pressures, including body size, relative metabolic rate, predation, type and location of food sources, and immune function. Sleep (especially deep SWS and REM) is tricky behavior because it steeply increases predation risk. This means that, for sleep to have evolved, the functions of sleep should have provided a substantial advantage over the risk <b>it</b> <b>entails.</b> In fact, studying sleep in different organisms shows how they have balanced this risk by evolving partial sleep mechanisms or by having protective habitats. Thus, studying the {{evolution of}} sleep might give a clue not only to the developmental aspects and mechanisms, but also to an adaptive justification for sleep.|$|E
25|$|Although asado is eaten {{all over}} the country, its origin may {{be traced back to}} the Pampas. <b>It</b> <b>entails</b> {{manifold}} types of meat, which are generally eaten as follows: achuras (offal, or the cow's inner parts), morcilla (blood sausage), and sometimes also a provoleta (a piece of provolone cheese cooked on the grill with oregano) are eaten first. Then comes the choripán (a kind of spiced sausage made with pork or lamb and placed between two slices of bread), and lastly meat such as asado de tira, vacío (flank steak), lomo (tenderloin), colita de cuadril (rump), matambre (rolled stuffed steak cut into slices and served cold), entraña (innards); the list is never-ending. It is quite common to eat and enjoy a dish known as cabrito al asador (roast kid or goat) in the province of Córdoba.|$|E
500|$|Political {{abuse of}} {{psychiatry}} is {{the misuse of}} psychiatric diagnosis, detention and treatment {{for the purposes of}} obstructing the fundamental human rights of certain groups and individuals in a society. <b>It</b> <b>entails</b> the exculpation and committal of citizens to psychiatric facilities based upon political rather than mental health-based criteria. Many authors, including psychiatrists, also use the terms [...] "Soviet political psychiatry" [...] or [...] "punitive psychiatry" [...] to refer to this phenomenon.|$|E
5000|$|Aryanization (Arisierung) {{is a term}} coined during Nazism {{referring}} to the forced expulsion of so-called [...] "non-Aryans", mainly Jews, from business life in Nazi Germany and the territories <b>it</b> controlled. <b>It</b> <b>entailed</b> the transfer of Jewish property into [...] "Aryan" [...] hands in order to [...] "de-Jew the economy".|$|R
5000|$|Very low {{flash point}} fuels like naphtha, butane, and propane {{can create a}} {{condensed}} vapor build-up in the oral cavity leading to internal combustion, damaging the mouth or lungs. Naphtha is also quite carcinogenic, and performance careers built on using <b>it</b> <b>entail</b> {{a high risk of}} mouth cancer.|$|R
50|$|In 1925 Thompson {{discovered}} a tholos tomb {{that proved to}} be the burial place of the king and queen of Midea. She completed her Ph.D. at Bryn Mawr College in 1931; <b>it</b> <b>entailed</b> a study of the 117 Hellenistic terracotta figures from Myrina in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston.|$|R
500|$|Restricting speech inevitably {{prevents}} ascertainment {{and publication}} of true facts and accurate judgments – <b>it</b> <b>entails</b> an unwarranted [...] "assumption of infallibility" [...] {{on the part}} of the government. As argued by John Stuart Mill and analysed by Eric Barendt, allowing freedom of speech ensures that the government's policies are right and appropriate to legislate; even the possibility of false speech should not prevent genuine expression of true beliefs. Nevertheless, since inflammatory speech that may provoke disorder must be prevented, a government should be entitled to prioritize public order considerations over permitting individuals to express their personal opinions. Balancing the risk of damage and disorder against long-term benefits of uninhibited debate is imperative.|$|E
500|$|It was {{reported}} that Ocean was really stretching {{the limits of the}} term “song” on [...] "Pyramids", and that there are [...] "more ideas on this track than on most albums". The single runs the gamut of Ocean’s various influences, pulling from European electronic dance music and Prince's early 80s discography, notably Purple Rain. The moody tune finds Ocean moaning over ethereal swirls and pulses while cooing about [...] "working at the pyramid" [...] and finding [...] "my Black queen Cleopatra." [...] <b>It</b> <b>entails</b> a multitude of [...] "suites and a kaleidoscope of moods and tones" [...] from [...] "vainglorious to melancholic" [...] and has been called the [...] "Paranoid Android" [...] of R Although Ocean is often labeled as an R artist, he has [...] "entirely steered clear of confining himself to one genre" [...] with the song.|$|E
500|$|Mereka Bilang, Saya Monyet! {{deals with}} the after effects of child molestation {{in a way that}} the Indonesian {{magazine}} Tempo describes as an [...] "interesting time control experiment", replete with flashbacks which clearly establish the time frame in which scenes happen. According to Wicaksono Adi, in his review for Kompas, Adjeng's writing is her therapy, as <b>it</b> <b>entails</b> constant reconstruction and deconstruction of her troubled past; he posits that this ultimately allows Adjeng to fight back against the authority figures who had troubled her since she was young. In a making-of documentary on the film, Ayu said that she had no moral message or social criticism in mind when creating the film, considering it instead a form of self-exploration. Admitting that the film could be read as a critique of violence against women and children, she said that she could empathise as a woman.|$|E
50|$|When the {{domestic}} Environmental Protection Administration’s (EPA) Taiwan Air Quality Monitoring Network (TAQMN) {{was established in}} 1990, <b>it</b> <b>entailed</b> nineteen air quality monitoring stations, having increased to sixty-six in 1993 and to seventy-two in 1998. In 2003, the pollutants which it monitored included NO2, CO, PM, O3, SO2 and HCs.|$|R
5000|$|... "Stock watering" [...] was {{originally}} a method used {{to increase the}} weight of livestock before sale. <b>It</b> <b>entailed</b> tricking cattle to bloat itself with water before it was weighed during a sale transaction. Its introduction to the New York financial district is popularly credited to Daniel Drew, a cattle driver turned financier.|$|R
5000|$|The {{original}} Dojeon {{was published}} in Korean on October 25, 1992 for the 122nd commemoration of Sangjenim’s birth, and <b>it</b> <b>entailed</b> twenty years of extensive research and fieldwork by Jeung San Do practitioners as they compiled the written and oral testimonies of Sangjenim’s and Taemonim’s disciples, the disciples’ descendants, and the disciples’ students.|$|R
