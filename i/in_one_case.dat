5|$|Fishers {{have had}} a long history of contact with humans, but most of it has been to the {{detriment}} of fisher populations. Unprovoked attacks on humans are extremely rare, but fishers will attack if they feel threatened or cornered. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>case,</b> a fisher was blamed for an attack on a six-year-old boy. In another case, a fisher is believed to be responsible for an attack on a twelve-year-old boy.|$|E
5|$|Gravel was in {{the next}} several debates, <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>case</b> after CNN {{reversed}} a decision to exclude him. Gravel, as with some of the other second-tier candidates, did not get as much time as the leaders; during the June 2, 2007, New Hampshire debate, which lasted two hours, he was asked 10 questions and allowed to speak for five minutes and 37 seconds.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 the Hungarian {{newspaper}} Life and Literature {{revealed that}} Szabó {{had been an}} informant of the Communist regime's secret police. Between 1957 and 1961, he submitted forty-eight reports on seventy-two people, mostly classmates and teachers at the Academy of Theatrical and Cinematic Arts. According to historian Istvan Deak, only <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>case</b> did Szabó's informing cause significant damage, when an individual was denied a passport.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we enumerate {{essentially}} all non-symmetric association schemes with three classes, less than 96 vertices {{and with a}} regular group of automorphisms. The enumeration {{is based on a}} computer search in Schur rings. The most interesting cases have 64 vertices. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> primitive <b>case</b> and <b>in</b> <b>one</b> imprimitive <b>case</b> where no association scheme was previously known we find several new association schemes. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> other imprimitive <b>case</b> with 64 vertices we find association schemes with an automorphism group of rank 4, which was previously assumed not to be possible...|$|R

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>case,</b> after Roy Goldfinger, {{author of}} the COMTRAN manual and intermediate-range {{committee}} member, attended a subcommittee meeting to support his language and {{encourage the use of}} algebraic expressions, Grace Hopper sent a memo to the short-range committee reiterating Sperry Rand's efforts to create a language based on English.|$|E
5|$|In other instances, {{managers}} deliberately {{used the}} reforms {{as an opportunity}} to cut wages, exaggerating wage cuts made by the ministries so that {{they would be able to}} cut back on overall expenditure. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>case,</b> a manager of a concrete factory was sentenced to eight months corrective labour after being found guilty of using the reforms as a pretext to extract unpaid overtime from workers.|$|E
5|$|In some cases, {{rather than}} being predatory, tiger attacks on human seem to be {{territorial}} in nature. At least <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>case,</b> a tigress with cubs killed eight people entering her territory without consuming them at all.|$|E

5|$|Littleton {{incorporated}} {{optical lens}} blanks manufactured by Corning {{with his own}} hot-worked glass. In each case he sandblasted and cut the optical disc, draping, and <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>case</b> piercing, the disc with fluid, cased glass forms. These were followed, in 1978, by Littleton’s Solid Geometry series, in which heavy cased glass forms were cut into trapezoidal, spheroid and ovoid shapes and highly polished.|$|E
5|$|Saint Michael the Archangel appears {{often in}} heraldic settings. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>case,</b> the device from the shield of the Trinity {{is placed on}} a blue field and {{attributed}} to St. Michael (Dennys, 95). More usually, he is shown in armour with a red cross on a white shield, slaying the devil depicted as a dragon. These attributed arms were later transferred to Saint George (Dennys, 109).|$|E
5|$|Similar events {{occurred}} across southern Vietnam, and <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>case</b> in Bến Tre, another self-proclaimed mystic {{launched an}} uprising that {{was similar to}} Long's 1913 effort. In all, riots or uprisings broke out in 13 of the 20 provinces of Cochinchina. The French {{declared a state of}} emergency and continued their crackdown against Long's followers and other rebels, making a further 1,660 arrests, which resulted in 261 incarcerations.|$|E

5|$|The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle is a {{collection}} of annals in Old English chronicling the history of the Anglo-Saxons. The original manuscript of the Chronicle was created late in the 9th century, probably in Wessex, during the reign of Alfred the Great. Multiple copies were made of that one original and then distributed to monasteries across England, where they were independently updated. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>case,</b> the Chronicle was still being actively updated in 1154.|$|E
5|$|The new depot at Temple Mills, to {{the north}} of Stratford, {{replaced}} the North Pole depot in the west of London. In testing, the first Eurostar train ran in St Pancras on 6 March 2007. All CTRL connections are fully grade-separated. This is achieved through use of viaducts, bridges, cuttings and <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>case,</b> the tunnel portal itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{transition}} to a more radical form of poetry {{seems to have taken}} place in 1913-1915, during the periods when Tzara and Vinea were vacationing together. The pieces share a number of characteristics and subjects, and the two poets even use them to allude to one another (or, <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>case,</b> to Tzara's sister).|$|E

5|$|Townships {{were given}} {{authority}} to construct roads {{under the supervision}} of county commissioners in 1817. This supervision was difficult since <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>case,</b> one county covered all of the Upper Peninsula and several of today's counties in the Lower Peninsula. Direct supervision over construction was granted to the townships in 1827, and federal involvement in road building ended with the 1837 grant of statehood.|$|E
5|$|A Book of the Dead papyrus was {{produced}} to order by scribes. They were commissioned {{by people in}} preparation for their own funeral, or by the relatives of someone recently deceased. They were expensive items; one source gives {{the price of a}} Book of the Dead scroll as one deben of silver, perhaps half the annual pay of a labourer. Papyrus itself was evidently costly, as there are many instances of its re-use in everyday documents, creating palimpsests. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>case,</b> a Book of the Dead was written on second-hand papyrus.|$|E
5|$|A second method {{involves}} artificially inseminating {{an elephant}} egg cell with sperm cells from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass. The resulting offspring {{would be an}} elephant–mammoth hybrid, and the process {{would have to be}} repeated so more hybrids could be used in breeding. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing is a hindrance to this method. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>case,</b> an Asian elephant and an African elephant produced a live calf named Motty, but it died of defects at less than two weeks old.|$|E

5|$|Also, {{there have}} been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar urticaria. For those {{susceptible}} to visible light, white T-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>case,</b> doctors found that the white T-shirt absorbed UVA radiation from the sun and transformed it into visible light which caused the reaction. Another patient was being treated with the antibiotic tetracycline for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, the first case to implicate tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{licensed}} to practise {{medicine in the}} United States, he began testing the boxes on human beings diagnosed with cancer and schizophrenia. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>case</b> the test had to be stopped prematurely because the subject heard a rumour that Reich was insane; there were stories, which were false, {{that he had been}} hospitalized in the Utica State Mental Hospital. In another case the father of an eight-year-old girl with cancer approached him for help, then complained to the American Medical Association that he was practising without a licence. He asked his supporters to stick with him through the criticism, believing that he had developed a grand unified theory of physical and mental health.|$|E
5|$|Anecdotally {{injection}} of alprazolam has been reported, causing dangerous damage to blood vessels, closure {{of blood vessels}} (embolization) and decay of muscle tissue (rhabdomyolysis). Alprazolam is not very soluble in water—when crushed in water it does not fully dissolve (40µg/ml of H2O at pH 7). There have also been anecdotal reports of alprazolam being snorted. Due to the low weight of a dose, alprazolam, <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>case,</b> was distributed on blotter paper {{in a manner similar}} to LSD.|$|E
