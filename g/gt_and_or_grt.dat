40|$|The {{ability of}} guinea pigs to make immune {{responses}} to GA, a linear random copolymer of L-glutamic acid <b>and</b> L-alanine, <b>GT,</b> a random linear copolymer of L-glutamic acid and L-tyrosine, and PLL, a linear homopolymer of L-lysine, {{is controlled by}} different autosomal dominant genes specific for each of those polymers. We have investigated {{the relationship between the}} PLL gene and the GA <b>and</b> <b>GT</b> immune response genes by simultaneously immunizing random-bred Hartley strain guinea pigs with GA <b>and</b> PLL, <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> PLL, <b>or</b> GA <b>and</b> <b>GT.</b> In most Hartley guinea pigs the ability to respond immunologically to GA and to PLL is inherited together; that is, most animals responding to GA respond to PLL and vice versa. However, a few animals respond to either GA or to PLL but not both, demonstrating that the GA and PLL immune response genes are not identical but linked in most Hartley animals. Conversely, when simultaneously immunized with <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> PLL, most Hartley guinea pigs respond to either PLL or GT but not both, indicating that <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> PLL responsiveness tends to segregate away from each other. Thus, the <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> PLL immune response genes also are not inherited independently but, rather, behave as alleles or pseudoalleles. Similar results are observed when Hartley guinea pigs are simultaneously immunized with GA <b>and</b> <b>GT.</b> The ability to respond to GA segregates away from the ability to respond to GT. Our studies demonstrated that the specific immune response genes thus far identified in guinea pigs controlling the ability to respond to GA, <b>GT,</b> <b>and</b> PLL, respectively, are found on the same chromosome. In most Hartley animals, the GA and PLL immune response genes are often linked, i. e. occur on the same chromosome strand, and tend to behave as alleles or pseudoalleles to the GT immune response gene...|$|R

40|$|Higher {{plants can}} produce {{a wide variety of}} {{anthocyanin}} molecules through modification of the six common anthocyanin aglycons that they present. Thus, hydrophilic anthocyanin molecules can be formed and stabilized by glycosylation and acylation. Two types of glycosyltransferase (<b>GT)</b> <b>and</b> acyltransferase (AT) have been identified, namely cytoplasmic <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> AT <b>and</b> vacuolar <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> AT. Cytoplasmic <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> AT utilize UDP-sugar and acyl-CoA as donor molecules, respectively, whereas both vacuolar <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> AT use acyl-glucoses as donor molecules. In carnation plants, vacuolar GT uses aromatic acyl-glucoses as the glucose donor in vivo; independently, vacuolar AT uses malylglucose, an aliphatic acyl-glucose, as the acyl-donor. In delphinium and Arabidopsis, p-hydroxybenzoylglucose and sinapoylglucose are used in vivo as bi-functional donor molecules by vacuolar <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> AT, respectively. The evolution of these enzymes has allowed delphinium and Arabidopsis to utilize unique donor molecules for production of highly modified anthocyanins...|$|R

40|$|An {{affinity}} {{between the}} Gospel of Thomas (<b>GT)</b> <b>and</b> the Gospel of John (GJ), noticed already when only the Greek fragments of GT were available, {{has become more}} apparent since {{the recovery of the}} Coptic GT. Explanations for this kinship thus far support the thesis that <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> GJ interpret a tradition of Jesus 2 ̆ 7 sayings in relationship to each other, focusing on which was earlier and adapted by the other. This dissertation presents an alternative: <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> GJ are roughly contemporary texts that independently and distinctively interpret a tradition of Jesus 2 ̆ 7 sayings. I attempt to recover these sayings, investigate how each gospel interprets them, and compare these interpretations for their areas of similarity and divergence. In the introduction I first review current research on the questions of <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> GJ 2 ̆ 7 s relationship to the Synoptics, <b>and</b> of <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> GJ 2 ̆ 7 s relationship to one another. Secondly, I propose a three-part thesis: (1) <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> GJ independently interpret a collection of sayings attributed to Jesus; (2) this tradition of sayings and these gospels witness to an early Christian wisdom theology; (3) this wisdom tendency is the matrix for both <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> GJ. Thirdly, I present a reading of <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> GJ that compares them to Jewish wisdom literature as a preface to the detailed analysis that follows. Lastly, I describe the method used in this study. In Chapter One I suggest that GT uses a variety of interpretive techniques to develop a wisdom commentary and that GJ creates a mythic story of Jesus as Wisdom. These heuristic macro-structures {{set the stage for the}} subsequent investigations. Each of Chapters Two through Six follows three steps: (1) the recovery of a traditional saying shared by <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> GJ through their formulations of it; (2) an examination of the saying 2 ̆ 7 s interpretation in <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> in GJ; (3) a comparison of these interpretations to measure the extent of their similarity and divergence. This dissertation has three major results: (1) the recovery of a sayings tradition; (2) its influence on GT 2 ̆ 7 s wisdom commentary and on GJ 2 ̆ 7 s story of Jesus as Wisdom; (3) a reading of <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> GJ as distinctive but compatible gospels of Christian wisdom...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Plasma {{efavirenz}} {{concentrations in}} HIV-infected patients with tuberculosis (TB) {{may be affected}} by cytochrome P 450 (CYP) 2 B 6 single-nucleotide polymorphisms and concurrent rifampicin use. We aimed to investigate the effects of CYP 2 B 6 G 516 T polymorphisms and concomitant rifampicin use on the plasma efavirenz concentrations in HIV-infected Taiwanese. METHODS: HIV-infected patients with or without TB who had received combination antiretroviral therapy containing efavirenz (600 mg daily) for two weeks or greater were enrolled for determinations of CYP 2 B 6 G 516 T polymorphism and plasma efavirenz concentrations {{with the use of}} polymerase-chain-reaction restriction fragment-length polymorphism and high-performance liquid chromatography, respectively. RESULTS: From October 2009 to August 2012, 171 HIV-infected patients, including 18 with TB, were enrolled 113 (66. 1 %) with CYP 2 B 6 G 516 G, 55 (32. 2 %) <b>GT,</b> <b>and</b> 3 (1. 8 %) TT genotype. Patients receiving rifampicin had a significantly lower median plasma efavirenz concentration than the control group (2. 16 vs 2. 92 mg/L, P =  0. 003); however, all patients achieved target plasma concentration (> 1 mg/L). Patients with GT or TT genotype had a significantly higher plasma concentration than those with GG genotype (2. 50 vs 3. 47 mg/L for <b>GT</b> genotype <b>and</b> 8. 78 mg/L for TT genotype, P 4 mg/L was noted in 38 (22. 2 %) patients, which was associated with a lower weight (per 10 -kg increase, odds ratio, 0. 52; 95 % confidence interval, 0. 33 - 0. 83) <b>and</b> <b>GT</b> <b>or</b> TT genotype (odds ratio, 4. 35; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 97 - 9. 59) in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Despite combination with rifampicin, sufficient plasma efavirenz concentrations can be achieved in HIV-infected Taiwanese with TB who receive efavirenz 600 mg daily. Carriage of CYP 2 B 6 516 <b>GT</b> <b>and</b> TT genotypes and a lower weight are associated with higher plasma efavirenz concentrations...|$|R

40|$|The interconversion {{equation}} of linear viscoelasticity defines implicitly the interrelations between the relaxation <b>and</b> creep functions <b>G(t)</b> <b>and</b> J(t). It is widely utilised in rheology to estimate J(t) from measurements of <b>G(t)</b> <b>and</b> conversely. Because different molecular details can be recovered from <b>G(t)</b> <b>and</b> J(t), {{it is necessary}} to work with both. This leads naturally to the need to identify whether it is better to first measure <b>G(t)</b> <b>and</b> then determine J(t) or conversely. This requires an understanding of the stability (sensitivity) of the recovery of J(t) from G(t) compared with that of G(t) from J(t). Although algorithms are available that work adequately in both directions, numerical experimentation strongly suggests that the recovery of J(t) from G(t) measurements is the more stable. An elementary theoretical rationale has been given recently by Anderssen et al. (ANZIAM J 48 :C 346 –C 363, 2007) for single exponential models of <b>G(t)</b> <b>and</b> J(t). It explicitly exploits the simple algebra of such functions. In this paper, corresponding bounds are derived that hold for arbitrary sums of exponentials. The paper concludes with a discussion, from a practical rheological perspective, about the implications and implementations of the results...|$|R
