He persisted and succeeded in recruiting her for the Avex label in the following year. Hamasaki started vocal training, but skipped most of <b>her</b> <b>classes</b> after finding her instructors to be too rigid and the classes dull. When she confessed this to Matsuura, he sent her to New York to train her vocals under another method. During her foreign sojourn, Hamasaki frequently corresponded with Matsuura and impressed him with her style of writing. On her return to Japan, he suggested that she try writing her own lyrics.|$|E

Through her, Fudge gradually gains power over Hogwarts and Dumbledore, who he fears is building an under-age wizard army to overthrow the Ministry. Umbridge forbids practical defence practice in <b>her</b> <b>classes,</b> forcing Harry, Ron, and Hermione to form Dumbledore's Army (a defence group led by Harry) with fellow friends. It is when the Ministry discovers the D.A. that Dumbledore, choosing to accept the responsibility, falsely claims that the organisation was his own subversive creation, and allows himself to be removed as headmaster (for the second time) rather than allow Harry to be expelled.|$|E

25|$|In the 1930s, {{she began}} {{studying}} modern art through learning {{the components of}} composition, technique, and theory. This initial investigation into modern art formed her work {{throughout the rest of}} her career. She began taking classes from Hans Hofmann in 1937, which modernized her approach to the nude and still life. He emphasized the two-dimensional nature of the picture plane and usage of color to create spatial illusion that was not representative of reality through his lessons. Throughout <b>her</b> <b>classes</b> with Hofmann, Krasner worked in an advanced style of cubism, also known as neo-cubism. During the class, a human nude or a still life setting would be the model from which Krasner and other students would have to work. She typically created charcoal drawings of the human models and oil on paper color studies of the still life settings. She typically illustrated female nudes in a cubist manner with tension achieved through the fragmentation of forms and the opposition of light and dark colors. The still lifes illustrated her interest in fauvism since she suspended brightly colored pigment on white backgrounds.|$|E
500|$|Ferrari {{enrolled}} at the Normal School Nº 1 of Buenos Aires, receiving her teaching certificate in 1903. For a woman of Ferrari's social class, paid work was unusual at the time. It was understood that in cases of financial necessity poor women might nurse or teach, because both were considered charitable, but upper class women {{were expected to be}} no more than wives and mothers. Ignoring convention, she embarked on a career in medicine, but also began teaching. Ferrari taught at the Colegio William Morris and the Escuela Nº 3 Bernardino Rivadavia. She had studied psychology in a cutting-edge field known as [...] "experimental psychology" [...] and applied it to <b>her</b> <b>classes,</b> which caused the authorities to launch an investigation into her teaching methods. She was allowed to continue teaching, as her techniques of motivating students and encouraging them to learn proved effective.|$|E
500|$|Lynn was {{a center}} of the shoe {{industry}} and most of Eddy's students were factory workers or artisans. She charged $100, raised {{a few weeks later}} to $300, for a three-week course of 12 lessons (reduced in 1888 to seven). Eddy based the lessons on a revised version of Quimby's [...] "Questions and Answers" [...] manuscript, now called [...] "The Science of Man, by which the sick are healed, Embracing Questions and Answers in Moral Science," [...] and on three shorter manuscripts, [...] "The Soul's Inquiry of Man," [...] "Spiritualism" [...] and [...] "Individuality," [...] which she had written for <b>her</b> <b>classes.</b> [...] "Questions and Answers" [...] began: [...] "What is God?" [...] The answer: [...] "Principle, wisdom, love, and truth." [...] Two books on mental healing appeared around that time that may have influenced Eddy's thinking: The Mental Cure (1869) and Mental Medicine (1872), both by Warren Felt Evans, another former patient of Quimby's.|$|E

[...] "Release" [...] was originally going to be written by Shiban alone, but he later turned the script over to Amann because he was needed elsewhere at the time. Shiban had been desiring {{to write a story}} like [...] "Release" [...] for a while. The character of Hayes was crafted as an ambitious character, inspired by the works of Arthur Conan Doyle: he was written to be either a [...] "brilliant guy who's solving crimes with his amazing intuition", comparable to Sherlock Holmes, or [...] "a guy who's actually doing those crimes and playing a game", like Professor Moriarty. Shiban and Amman came up with a story wherein Scully encounters a [...] "genius" [...] from <b>her</b> <b>classes</b> at the FBI Academy at Quantico.
