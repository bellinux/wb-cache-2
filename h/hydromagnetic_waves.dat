40|$|<b>Hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> {{characteristics}} at ionospheric altitude {{have been}} statistically {{detected in the}} MAGSAT magnetic field data by a cross-spectral analysis. The region where the averaged phase shift between the north-south and the east-west components has some finite value appeared systematically around the auroral oval, indicating an existence of the <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> component of comparable magnitude with the magnetic fluctuation generated by small-scale field-aligned currents. The low frequency waves (0. 125 - 0. 25 Hz) showed left-handed polarization (L-mode) and the amplitude was around 5 - 10 nT. On the other hand, the R-mode waves dominated in 1. 0 - 2. 0 Hz range and the amplitude {{was estimated to be}} about 1 nT...|$|R
40|$|The {{feasibility}} {{of using a}} <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> sensor on the space shuttles was investigated. It was found that although existing sensors are inadequate in terms of resolution, dynamic range, and frequency range, they can be modified {{to make the necessary}} measurements. It is shown that since the sensor cannot be mounted on the shuttle itself because of high levels of magnetic noise, a free subsatellite that can be positioned and stabilized may be used for locating the <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> sensor. Other results show that studies of long period waves would require either an array of sensors in shuttle orbit or a long-term mapping of the crustal anomalies, and that effective wave studies would require at least two variably spaced sensors in shuttle orbit and one ground station...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the limit}} of low {{magnetic}} field (vA&rarr;0), the wave turns into an ordinary ion acoustic wave. In {{the limit of}} low temperature (vs&rarr;0), the wave becomes a modified Alfvén wave. Because the phase velocity of the magnetosonic mode is almost always larger than vA, the magnetosonic wave is often called the [...] "fast" [...] <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave.</b>|$|R

50|$|In the {{presence}} of the ionospheric plasma and the geomagnetic field, electromagnetic waves exist for frequencies which are larger than the gyrofrequency of the ions (about 1 Hz). Waves with frequencies smaller than the gyrofrequency are called <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves.</b> The geomagnetic pulsations with periods of seconds to minutes as well as Alfvén waves belong to that type of waves.|$|E
50|$|Proof of Birkeland's {{theory of}} the aurora only came in 1967 after a probe was sent into space. The crucial results were {{obtained}} from U.S. Navy satellite 1963-38C, launched in 1963 and carrying a magnetometer above the ionosphere. Magnetic disturbances were observed on nearly every pass over the high-latitude regions of the Earth. These were originally interpreted as <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves,</b> but on later analysis it was {{realized that they were}} due to field-aligned or Birkeland currents.|$|E

Prof. Trehan has done significant work on stability of force-free magnetic fields, stability ofjets and cylinders {{and stability of}} inhomogeneous plasmas. His work on the mathematical treatment of gaseous polytropes {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field is a breakthrough in this area. He has also done important work on <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> and rotating gaseousmasses.|$|E
30|$|We {{consider}} that the westward drift is a manifestation of hydromagnetic process near {{the surface of the}} core, where the dipole field is dominant. From a nature of the drifting field, we assume that the surface layer of the core is rotating westwards as a whole. The uniform drift rate, one of the characteristic features of the drifting field, implies that the drift velocity is nondispersive. It has long been a matter of controversy whether the westward drift is due to a material flow or a <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> (Bullard et al. 1950; Hide 1966; Holme 2015). The uniform drift rate seems to favor the material flow, in which the field is generated and conveyed together. Because the <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> is a dispersive wave in general, the wave velocity is highly dependent on harmonics. We assume here that the surface layer is rotating westwards, in which the sectorial type field is produced by interaction of fluid flow with the dipole field.|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} from quasilinear theory that an {{initially}} isotropic magnetized plasma {{will be forced}} into an anisotropic state in ion-cyclotron resonance heating. Strong heating of perpendicular ion temperature and strong cooling of longitudinal temperature should occur simultaneously. The maximum temperature ratio predicted by quasilinear theory is in exact agreement with that predicted from basic thermodynamic arguments by Busnardo [...] Neto, Dawson, Kamimura and Lin. Heating by fast <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> is also examined. (auth...|$|R

40|$|The two-fluid solar-wind {{model is}} {{extended}} by including the collisionless dissipation of <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> originating at the sun.

40|$|Hydromagnetic heating in {{the solar}} wind was {{investigated}} using the heating model in which fast-mode <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> propagate outward from below the base and deposit energy by collisionless damping. Ray paths were found by solving Hamilton's equations. As the ray propagates along its path, it will damp, supplying thermal energy to the solar wind gas. The strong agreement of these results with observations is clear indication that the primary nonthermal heat source {{in the solar}} wind is the collisionless damping of <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves...</b>|$|E
40|$|Two {{different}} {{observations of}} Comet Kohoutek (1973 f) {{seem to suggest}} the existence of substantial magnetic fields (not less than 100 gammas) in its coma and tail. The effects of the currents and <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> associated with these magnetic fields are considered. It is shown that while the currents closing through the inner coma may represent {{an important source of}} ionization in that region, the dissipation of <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> may also be a significant, if not dominant, source of heating there...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have covered}} {{a wide range}} of {{problems}} in the space environment, such as the problems of the dynamical behavior of the thermosphere, <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> propagation in the ionosphere, and interplanetary space environment. The theories used to analyze these problems range from a continuum theory of magnetohydrodynamics to the kinetic theory of free molecular flow. This is because the problems encountered covered the entire range of the Knudsen number (i. e., the ratio of mean free path to the characteristic length). Significant results are summarized...|$|R
40|$|A {{propulsion}} {{concept was}} developed {{based on a}} proposed resonance between coherent, pulsed electromagnetic wave forms, and gravitational wave forms (or space-time metrics). Using this concept a spacecraft propulsion system potentially capable of galactic and intergalactic travel without prohibitive travel times was designed. The propulsion system utilizes recent research associated with magnetic field line merging, <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> effects, free-electron lasers, laser generation of megagauss fields, and special structural and containment metals.

40|$|A brief {{review of}} {{time-dependent}} theories of resonant mode coupling of Alfven waves in space plasmas is presented. A well behaved solution of the <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> equation for a general class of initial conditions is then discussed to understand the ringing, phase-mixing and variable eigenperiods of the field line oscillations in the magnetosphere. This solution is further exploited to discuss the initial transient amplification of Alfven waves in sheared magnetospheric plasma. The features of free oscillations of field lines studied are shown to compare well with previous numerical studies and observations made for particular types of impulse excitations of the magnetosphere...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{energetic}} ion and low-frequency wave {{experiments on}} ISEE 1, 2, and 3, have established {{correlations between the}} types of ion populations and waves observed {{to exist in the}} earth's foreshock region. The present calculation has the objective to quantitatively test the picture obtained for the earth's foreshock region. An analysis is conducted of the coupled spatial and temporal evolution of upstream protons and <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> by means of a simple model in which the protons are represented by counterstreaming beams which resonate with <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves,</b> exciting the outward propagating modes and damping the inward propagating modes at a single wave number...|$|E
30|$|This {{equation}} {{was first}} derived to describe an approximation for surface long waves in nonlinear dispersive media. It can also characterize the <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> {{in a cold}} plasma, acoustic waves in harmonic crystals, and acoustic gravity waves in compressible fluids.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the propagation of}} <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> generated by a compact turbulent source in low ionized plasmas, applying the Lighthill theory. We assume the plasma to be isothermal, and adopt a uniform, stationary medium thread by ordered magnetic fields as an initial condition. Then, the distinct properties of the <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> originating from a source oscillating with a fixed frequency are studied in the linear regime. As is well known, in low ionized plasmas, the generated waves dissipate due to ion–neutral damping. In this paper, the dependence of the dissipation rate on {{the frequency of the}} oscillating source is investigated. The larger the frequency becomes, the more substantial is the wave dissipation. Implications of our results on the energy source in molecular clouds are also discussed. Interestingly, since the outflow lobes associated with young stellar objects act as compact turbulent sources, <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>waves</b> are generated by them. From our order-estimations, about 70 % of the energy of the outflow itself propagates as waves or turbulences, while the remaining 30 % dissipates and heats the neutrals via ion– neutral damping. Then, we confirm that the outflows are significant energy sources in molecular clouds {{in the context of the}} Lighthill theory...|$|E

In all, thirteen solar wind quantities previously found important in driving terrestrial magnetospheric substorms and other auroral processes were examined for evidence of correlations with the Saturn radio emission. The {{results are consistent with}} <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> or eddy diffusion processes driven by large scale solar wind pressure changes at Saturn's dayside magnetopause.

40|$|The {{propagation}} of axisymmetric disturbances on a twisted magnetic flux tube in an inviscid, incompressible, unstratified atmosphere of infinite electrical conductivity is considered. Dispersion effects due to twist appear quickly only on highly twisted flux tubes for a superposition {{of the lowest}} radial eigenmodes and wavelengths comparable to the flux tube radius. These radial profiles become distorted and show focusing effects after propagating {{on the order of}} ten flux tube radii. This suggests twist effects on <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> propagation may be important where the flux tubes come up through the surface and expand into the tenuous atmosphere...|$|R

An energy flux of about 10 to the - 6 th W/sq m was observed propagating upward with a left-handed polarization within the arc, and a flux 6 times greater was observed propagating downward with a right-handed polarization on the arc boundary.

All interplanetary fluctuations whose time scale is observed to be greater than 1 sec can be regarded as hydromagnetic fluctuations.

The event is a transient <b>hydromagnetic</b> <b>wave</b> of two cycles duration with a six minute period. Large amplitude compressional and transverse magnetic components were present. Particle and magnetic pressure oscillations were in strict antiphase, but did not balance. When combined with the plasma velocity data these properties show that substantial Earthward field-aligned flows of electromagnetic energy and heat flux occurred during the vortex. The net energy flow perpendicular to B was in the antisolar direction. This event possesses hydromagnetic features unique to a hot plasma environment...|$|R
