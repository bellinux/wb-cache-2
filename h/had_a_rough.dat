5|$|As the {{university}} president, Middleton was constantly involved in personnel decisions, {{some of them}} making national news. One such ordeal occurred in February 1955 when the Board of Supervisors {{decided that it was}} time for the head football coach, Gaynell Tinsley, to be relieved following a break-even record in seven years. His successor, Paul Dietzel, was a 29-year-old assistant coach at the United States Military Academy. Dietzel <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>rough</b> beginning at LSU with three losing seasons, and calls for his removal became louder. Middleton supported Dietzel, however, and in his fourth season as coach the LSU Tigers not only had an undefeated season, but also won the Sugar Bowl and were declared the national champions.|$|E
