50|$|In 2004, BBC's {{motoring}} show Top Gear {{set up a}} {{race between}} two Espaces, a Toyota Previa, a Toyota MasterAce, a Mitsubishi Space Wagon, and a Nissan Serena. The <b>Espaces</b> came <b>first</b> and second.|$|R

50|$|The Chrysler minivans {{launched}} {{a few months}} ahead of the Renault <b>Espace</b> (the <b>first</b> MPV/minivan in Europe, initially presented to executives as a Talbot (which {{was made up of}} Chrysler Europe's disposed assets) in 1979, but not launched until 1984), making them the first of their kind — effectively creating the modern minivan segment in the US.|$|R
5000|$|... 1974: The <b>first</b> <b>Espace</b> Musical goes on {{exhibition}} at the Kunstverein in Hanover. - First Sculptures Erotiques. - Takis composes the music for Costas Gavras' film Section spéciale.|$|R
50|$|Concerts {{started at}} 7 p.m. {{on the great}} stage of the <b>Espace</b> Julien. The <b>first</b> three groups to perform that night were Milska, Rom Buddy Band and Solat', bands {{originated}} in southern French cities of Marseille and Montpellier.|$|R
50|$|The {{most obvious}} {{cosmetic}} exterior difference, between the very <b>first</b> <b>Espaces</b> and the revamped post 1988 models, were the changed headlights: the forward slanting lights with orange indicator casing {{of the original}} Espace were replaced with backward slanting lights, with a clear indicator casing.|$|R
50|$|Claude Goumy, the Managing Director of Matra <b>Espace</b> was the <b>first</b> Managing Director. The first deputy Managing Director was Richard Wignall, {{the former}} Managing Director of Marconi Space Systems. The space {{industry}} {{was important to}} France - almost half {{the budget of the}} European Space Agency (ESA) came from the French government.|$|R
5000|$|Designed by Antonis Volanis, the Rancho {{was based}} on the pick-up version of Simca's popular supermini, the Simca 1100, using its front {{structure}} and a stretched chassis. The rest of the body was made by Matra from fibreglass and polyester, including the mouldings adorning the body, which made it look more [...] "sturdy". This technology would later be used on the Renault <b>Espace,</b> Europe's <b>first</b> MPV, which was manufactured by Matra. The ground clearance was also increased. Unlike most off-roaders, it was not fitted with all-wheel drive, retaining the 1100's front-wheel drive layout. Other elements retained from the 1100 included the dashboard and front seats (identical to the ones found in the Simca 1100 GLS). The Rancho was powered by the 1,442 cc, 80 bhp version of the [...] "Poissy engine" [...] straight-four engine.|$|R
5000|$|... 1983 - Peugeot {{launches}} the new 205 supermini, {{styled by}} Italian designer Pininfarina. Renault {{has a new}} competitor in the mid-sized hatchback sector with the new 11. French production of the Peugeot 504 ends after 15 years. At {{the end of the}} year, Renault replaces its 20/30 flagship models with the R25.1984 - Renault launches the <b>Espace</b> - Europe's <b>first</b> volume multi purpose vehicle. The R5 receives a complete redesign but its styling is still recognisable as an update of the 1972 original.|$|R
50|$|The Rancho spawned an {{unlikely}} successor: the Renault Espace. Matra wanted {{to replace the}} Rancho with their prototype of the Espace known as the “dessin orange”, which translates to “the orange drawing” in English - both the prototype and the background it was drawn on were orange. It predicted the basic shape of the <b>first</b> <b>Espace</b> but only had three doors instead of five. Peugeot (who controlled Matra at the time) deemed the project too expensive and not promising enough. Determined to take its design to production Matra knocked on Renault’s door and they quickly adopted the project, one that upon its launch in 1984 arguably became the first European minivan.|$|R
5000|$|Lee Iacocca and Hal Sperlich had {{conceived}} {{their idea}} for a modern minivan during their earlier tenure at Ford Motor Company. Henry Ford II had rejected Iaccoca's and Sperlich's idea (and a prototype) of a minivan in 1974, then rumored to carry the name [...] "Maxivan". Iaccoca followed Sperlich to Chrysler Corporation, and together they created the T115 minivan — a prototype that was to become the Caravan and Voyager, known in initial marketing as the Magic-wagons. The vans used Chrysler' new S platform, derived from the Chrysler K-platform. The vans shared components with the Dodge Aires including portions of the interior, e.g., the Aries' instrument cluster and dashboard controls, along with the K-platform front-wheel drive layout and low floor, giving the vans car-like driving characteristics and driving positions. Chrysler introduced the Dodge Caravan and the Plymouth Voyager in November 1983 for the 1984 model year; The Chrysler minivans launched a few months ahead of the Renault <b>Espace</b> (the <b>first</b> MPV/minivan in Europe, initially presented to executives as a Talbot, which {{was made up of}} Chrysler Europe's disposed assets) in 1979, but not launched until 1984), making them the first of their kind — effectively creating the modern minivan segment in the US.|$|R
