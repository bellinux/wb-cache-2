5|$|According to the Miami Herald the <b>financing</b> <b>structure</b> of {{the plan}} is notable {{for the amount of}} {{financial}} risk taken by the builders in return for the long term concession on the tunnel. Opposition to the project states that it is a waste of taxpayer money, and may become Miami's Big Dig, the nickname of a tunnel megaproject in Boston, which was a $4 billion project that ended up costing $22 billion in cost overruns. Many believe that the Port of Miami Tunnel Project will be likely to have similar cost overruns, even though the Secretary of the Florida Department of Transportation (FDOT) promised that the project would finish on time and without overruns.

One {{of the more interesting}} notes to the Allco proposal was the nature of the financing arrangements it was proposing. At the time of the proposed financing deal, interest rates in Australia were around 16-17%, placing a significant burden on companies in their business dealings. To work around this, Allco proposed a <b>financing</b> <b>structure</b> that involved a cross-border financing arrangement in Japan. It also required the establishment of a special purposes lessor company, incorporated in the Cayman Islands, to minimise withholding tax liabilities from the Japanese and Australian taxation agencies. Allco refused to release specific information on the proposed structure, due to its policy prohibiting the release of specific details of this financing arrangement until it had secured a mandate for their services.|$|E

2500|$|Leveraged buyouts {{involve a}} {{financial}} sponsor agreeing to an acquisition without itself committing all the capital {{required for the}} acquisition. [...] To do this, the financial sponsor will raise acquisition debt which ultimately looks to the cash flows of the acquisition target to make interest and principal payments. [...] Acquisition debt in an LBO is often non-recourse to the financial sponsor and has no claim on other investments managed by the financial sponsor. [...] Therefore, an LBO transaction's financial structure is particularly attractive to a fund's limited partners, allowing them the benefits of leverage but greatly limiting the degree of recourse of that leverage. [...] This kind of <b>financing</b> <b>structure</b> leverage benefits an LBO's financial sponsor in two ways: (1) the investor itself only needs to provide {{a fraction of the}} capital for the acquisition, and (2) the returns to the investor will be enhanced (as long as the return on assets exceeds the cost of the debt).|$|E

2500|$|Rural areas In {{terms of}} rural and small town infrastructure, {{channeling}} {{funds to the}} final users through the various layers of local government remains a challenge. According to the World Bank, China differs from many other developing countries in {{that there is not}} a history of the central government providing large subsidies for the financing of rural water supply and sanitation. Instead, there is greater emphasis on self-reliance with rural people using their own contributions and resources to improve their water supply. This <b>financing</b> <b>structure</b> causes poor rural areas to [...] "accurately match their ability to pay with the proper type of systems and level of service", i.e. to choose sanitation solutions that they can afford. According to the World Bank, as a result, [...] "China is held up as a model for other developing countries". Support for capital costs for water supply is partially provided by the local and/or provincial government. Beneficiaries have to provide upfront capital contributions. Through World Bank financing and central government counterpart financing these upfront capital contributions were reduced, thus making sanitation more affordable to the poor. According to The Economist magazine, [...] "some provinces are now bypassing both the prefectural- and township-level governments in order to get funds more directly to rural areas." ...|$|E
