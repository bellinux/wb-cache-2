50|$|<b>Fail-passive</b> autopilot: {{in case of}} failure, the {{aircraft}} stays in a controllable position and the pilot can take control of it to go around or finish landing. It is usually a dual-channel system.|$|E
50|$|CAT IIIa -This {{category}} permits {{pilots to}} land {{with a decision}} height as low as 50 ft (15 m) and a RVR of 200 m. It needs a <b>fail-passive</b> autopilot. There must be only a 10âˆ’6 probability of landing outside the prescribed area.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Fail-Passive</b> systems {{continue}} {{to operate in the}} event of a system failure. An example includes an aircraft autopilot. In the event of a failure, the aircraft would remain in a controllable state and allow the pilot to take over and complete the journey and perform a safe landing.|$|E
50|$|CAT IIIb - As IIIa {{but with}} the {{addition}} of automatic roll out after touchdown incorporated with the pilot taking control some distance along the runway. This category permits pilots to land with a decision height less than 50 feet or no decision height and a forward visibility of 250 ft (76 m, compare this to aircraft size, some of which are now over 70 m long) or 300 ft (91 m) in the United States. For a landing-without-decision aid, a fail-operational autopilot is needed. For this category some form of runway guidance system is needed: at least <b>fail-passive</b> but it needs to be fail-operational for landing without decision height or for RVR below 100 m.|$|E
