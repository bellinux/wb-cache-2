The methods used for detecting the <b>embryotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> of substances are the classic when laboratory mammals are used and the alternative which use in vitro and in ovo systems. The main {{difference between these two}} is that the alternative methods lack metabolism of maternal organism. The metabolism of maternal organism brings a high variability of results to systems of the classic methods. We used two alternative methods in this thesis, both using chicken embryo. The first of them was in ovo method called CHEST (Jelínek, 1977). CHEST method can be used for administration of tested substances from ED 2 to ED 6.

Thus, if functions of the separate trace metals are studied well enough, the physiological role of such ultramicroelements as gold is still poorly studied especially in the field of its interaction with other metals. The aim of the research was an experimental study of peculiarities of gold aquananocitrate and lead acetate interaction and their impact on rats’ embryogenesis under condition of combined administration. There were used solutions of lead acetate and citrate gold in experimental models obtained by aquananotehnology.

40|$|A {{survey of}} the {{literature}} indicates that several chemicals whose reduced metabolites are capable of undergoing redox cycling in biological systems also possess significant teratogenic properties when tested in vivo. We have initiated investigations {{to determine whether the}} <b>embryotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of such chemicals could result from their redox cycling properties and whether redox cycling could be an important mechanism in chemical teratogenesis. In order to obviate the potentially confounding influences of maternal factors, our initial studies have been performed with a whole embryo culture system with redox cycling agents added directly to the culture medium. Several representative redox cycling agents including doxorubicin, paraquat, a series of nitroheterocycles, nitrosofluorene, and diethylstilbestrol (converted metabolically to redox cycling quinone/semiquinone radicals) have been investigated thus far. The nitroheterocycles which bear nitro groups with comparatively high redox potentials produced a striking, asymmetric defect involving primarily the right half of the prosencephalic and mesencephalic regions. The effect was exacerbated under conditions of low 02 tension. Accumulated data to date strongly suggest that reduction of the nitro group is an essential feature in the embryotoxic mechanism. Quinones (doxorubicin, paraquat) and compounds metabolically converted to quinones (diethylstilbestrol) appeared to produce <b>embryotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> via mechanisms not associated with redox cycling. Nitrosofluorene embryotoxicity was markedly exacerbated by changes in both intra- and extracellular glutathione levels, but definitive dependence on a radical-mediated effect or redox cycling was not demonstrated...|$|R

Studies on ethylene glycol alkyl ethers and related compounds administered to mice by oral gavage revealed the occurrence of testicular atrophy and decreased white blood cell count by EGM, EGdM, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether and ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, and the toxicity was related to their chemical structure.

In spite of its tight binding to DNA, great teratogenic effects do not characterize cisplatin, although its embryolethal and growth retardation activities are quite remarkable. On the basis of our previous observations, demonstrating the usefulness of procainamide hydrochloride for the protection against cisplatin toxic effects in adult mice and rats, we now analyze the feasibility of the combined treatment with cisplatin and the antiarrhythmic drug procainamide hydrochloride in pregnant mice and the possible protective action of procainamide against the embryotoxic activity of cisplatin. Our data, obtained in CD- 1 dams after treatment with 8 or 12 mg/kg cisplatin ip, with or without 50 mg/kg procainamide hydrochlo- ride iv, confirm the <b>embryotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of cisplatin.

The mechanism of action of this partially protective activity seems to be linked in part to the lower cisplatin accumulation in fetal tissue, probably due to an interaction of drugs at the level of placenta, in part to the protection of procainamide against maternal toxicity of cisplatin.

40|$|Mothers with {{untreated}} phenylketonuria (PKU) have {{an increased}} risk of bearing children with congenital malformations. PKU causes accumulation of phenylalanine (PHE) and its metabolites in urine and blood, and this condition may contribute to the developmental problems. In the present study we investigated the embryotoxicity of these compounds in the rat postimplantation embryo culture system. Whereas PHE was ineffective, phenylpyruvic acid and phenylacetic acid induced general growth retardation. Phenylacetic acid and O-hydroxyphenylacetic acid were also growth retarding and in addition affected yolk sac circulation. Phenylethylamine was the most embryotoxic compound tested, with a lowest effective concentration of 0. 03 g/l. It induced various anomalies including incomplete flexion and neural tube defects. The effects of a mixture of phenylketones in culture did not reveal synergism between compounds. In the presence of maternal hepatocytes PHE was metabolized in culture without leading to <b>embryotoxic</b> <b>effects.</b> Extending culture duration from 26 to 48 hours did not increase sensitivity to phenylpyruvic acid. No changes in osmolarity or pH of media were observed that might have been responsible for the embryotoxicity observed. Analysis with HPLC of media after culture revealed no biotransformation of added compounds into other metabolites, except for phenylpyruvic acid. In addition, in the presence of maternal hepatocytes, metabolism was observed that was not accompanied with <b>embryotoxic</b> <b>effects.</b> Embryo culture in human PKU sera, either or not supplemented with 5 % (v/v) rat serum, was not detrimental to development. Rather, embryo's tended to thrive better on PKU sera versus control sera. Analysis of human PKU sera revaled lower glucose levels and increased levels of PHE and PKU-related metabolites. The results suggest that the embryotoxicity of PKU-related phenylketones may contribute to teratogenicity of maternal PKU in man. However, in view of the relatively high concentrations necessary for embryotoxicity to occur in vitro, other factors yet unknown may play a significant role. Alternatively, the absence of embryotoxicity of human PKU sera in culture may be interpreted to suggest that the rat postimplantation embryo culture technique may not contain the developmental en points that are most vulnerable in maternal PKU. ...|$|R

In all extract concentrations there was stimulation in hatching in relation to the control, but only in concentration of 750 mg/mL it was statistically significant. In tannic acid (250 µg/ml) there was significant stimulus in hatching, but in 500, 750 and 1000 µg/mL there was significant inhibition. All concentrations of aqueous extract and tannic acid on larvae showed <b>embryotoxic</b> and embryostatic <b>effects</b> when compared to the control. The aqueous extract of R. mangle showed effect on hatching of A. aegypti eggs and synthetic tannic acid showed <b>embryotoxic</b> and embryostatic <b>effects.</b> On larvae, both the aqueous extract as tannic acid showed <b>embryotoxic</b> and embryostatic <b>effects...</b>|$|R
