5|$|In 1819, {{smoke was}} {{observed}} at the mountain. However, this is often not recorded as an eruption as the information was insufficient to <b>identify</b> <b>it</b> as such. Similarly, in 2003, a blowing cloud of snow was mistaken by {{an employee of the}} ConocoPhillips Building in Anchorage for an ash plume. Possible steam-vapor let off was observed in 1933 at the mountain.|$|E
5|$|Tracing in English {{law is a}} {{procedure}} to identify property (such as money) that has been taken from the claimant involuntarily. It is not in itself a way to recover the property, but rather to <b>identify</b> <b>it</b> so that the courts can decide what remedy to apply. The procedure is used in several situations, broadly demarcated by whether the property has been transferred because of theft, breach of trust, or mistake.|$|E
5|$|Although N. rajah has a {{restricted}} distribution {{and is often}} quoted as a plant in peril, it is not rare in the areas where it does grow and most populations are now off-limits to visitors and lie in remote parts of Kinabalu National Park. Furthermore, N. rajah has a distinctive leaf shape {{making it difficult to}} illegally ship abroad even if the pitchers are removed, as an informed customs official should be able to <b>identify</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

5|$|Around {{the same}} time, Franz-Joseph Müller von Reichenstein {{produced}} a similar substance, {{but could not}} <b>identify</b> <b>it.</b> The oxide was independently rediscovered in 1795 by Prussian chemist Martin Heinrich Klaproth in rutile from Boinik (German name of Bajmócska) village of Hungary (now Bojničky in Slovakia). Klaproth found that it contained a new element and named it for the Titans of Greek mythology. After hearing about Gregor's earlier discovery, he obtained a sample of manaccanite and confirmed it contained titanium.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{external}} appearance, Plectania nannfeldtii {{is similar to}} Pseudoplectania vogesiaca. Although this latter species {{may be difficult to}} distinguish by its less hairy external fruit body surface, its microscopic characters <b>identify</b> <b>it</b> more definitively: P.vogesiaca has spores that are much smaller, typically with widths of 12–14µm. Helvella corium is another black cup fungus that appears in the spring; it has smaller spores, whitish margins on the cup edges, and shorter stems than P.nannfeldtii. Pseudoplectania nigrella is smaller, with a hairier outer surface, a darker inner cup surface, and a rudimentary stem.|$|E
5|$|Due to its extreme {{distance}} from the Sun, Planet Nine would reflect little sunlight, potentially evading telescope sightings. It {{is expected to have}} an apparent magnitude fainter than 22, making it at least 600 times fainter than Pluto. If Planet Nine exists and is close to its perihelion, astronomers could <b>identify</b> <b>it</b> based on existing images. For its aphelion, the largest telescopes would be required. However, if the planet is currently located in between, many observatories could spot Planet Nine. Statistically, the planet {{is more likely to be}} closer to its aphelion at a distance greater than 500 AU. This is because objects move more slowly when near their aphelion, in accordance with Kepler's second law.|$|E

5|$|From {{the same}} site where T.goodmani was found, Samonds also {{recorded}} the distal (far) end of a Triaenops humerus (upper arm bone), with a width of 3.58mm. This bone was similar to humeri of T.menamena, {{but she did not}} <b>identify</b> <b>it</b> as either species because of the small size difference between T.menamena and T.goodmani. In site NCC-1 (estimated 69,600 to 86,800 years old), two Triaenops mandibles were recorded, one with p4 and m1 and another with m1–2 and part of m3. Relative to living Triaenops and Paratriaenops, m1 in those jaws is longer and narrower. Although sample sizes are small, the measurements do not resemble those of T.goodmani. In addition, the ridge between the entoconid and metaconid is stronger than in T.goodmani. Samonds identified these jaws only as Triaenops.|$|E
5|$|Jupiter is a {{powerful}} source of radio waves in the spectral region stretching from several kilohertz to tens of megahertz. Radio waves with frequencies of less than about 0.3MHz (and thus wavelengths longer than 1km) are called the Jovian kilometric radiation or KOM. Those with frequencies in the interval of 0.3–3MHz (with wavelengths of 100–1000m) are called the hectometric radiation or HOM, while emissions in the range 3–40MHz (with wavelengths of 10–100m) {{are referred to as}} the decametric radiation or DAM. The latter radiation was the first to be observed from Earth, and its approximately 10-hour periodicity helped to <b>identify</b> <b>it</b> as originating from Jupiter. The strongest part of decametric emission, which is related to Io and to the Io–Jupiter current system, is called Io-DAM.|$|E
5|$|Next to the apse is a {{mural of}} Saint Cyril of Alexandria, captioned as “Saint Cyril the Philosopher”, the 9th-century missionary to the Slavs. Although the {{position}} and iconography of the portrait clearly <b>identify</b> <b>it</b> as an image of Cyril of Alexandria, the caption hints that the local population confused the two saints and Cyril the Philosopher was still well-remembered at the time. Other images painted in the church include these of the Dormition of the Mother of God (above the entrance), the Transfiguration of Jesus (under the vault), John Damascene, Cosmas of Maiuma, Archangel Michael (south of the entrance), Saint Constantine and Saint Helena (right of the entrance).|$|E

5|$|The Colonel {{was finally}} {{discovered}} in the Dōtonbori River on March 10, 2009. Divers who recovered the statue at first thought {{it was only a}} large barrel, and shortly after a human corpse, but Hanshin fans on the scene were quick to <b>identify</b> <b>it</b> as the upper body of the long-lost Colonel. The right hand and lower body were found next day, but the statue is still missing its glasses and left hand. It is said that the only way the curse can be lifted is by returning his long-lost glasses and left hand.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin and}} age of the figure are unclear. It is often thought of as an ancient construction, though the {{earliest}} mention of it dates to the late 17th century. Early antiquarians associated it, on little evidence, with a Saxon deity, while other scholars sought to <b>identify</b> <b>it</b> with a Celtic British figure of the Greek Hercules or some syncretization of the two. Archaeological evidence that parts of the drawing have been lost over time strengthen the Hercules identification. The lack of earlier descriptions leads some modern scholars to conclude that it probably dates from the 17th century, and perhaps originated as political satire.|$|E
5|$|There is {{no simple}} way of {{differentiating}} a venomous snake from a non-venomous one merely by using a scale character. Finding out whether a snake is venomous or not is correctly done by identification of the species of a snake {{with the help of}} experts, or in their absence, close examination of the snake and using authoritative references on the snakes of the particular geographical region to <b>identify</b> <b>it.</b> Scale patterns help to indicate the species and from the references, it can be verified if the snake species is known to be venomous or not.|$|E
