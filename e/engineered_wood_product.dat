40|$|Wood {{waste from}} {{residential}} construction {{is a substantial}} part of construction and demolition waste. Ground mulch from this material could be useful onsite as a mulch, for erosion control, or as a substrate for heavy use areas. The Georgia Environmental Protection Division’s Commercial and Solid Waste Department is interested in allowing beneficial reuse of the mulched wood waste onsite, but had reservations about the use of <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products,</b> such as oriented strand board, due to the presence of adhesives such as phenol formaldehyde or resorcinol.

50|$|Stamina wood is an <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> made of veneers {{that have}} been dyed, then {{impregnated}} with phenolic resin and compressed under high pressure and heat.

50|$|Plywood, is a wood {{structural}} panel, {{is sometimes}} called the original <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product.</b> Plywood is manufactured from sheets of cross-laminated veneer and bonded under heat and pressure with durable, moisture-resistant adhesives. By alternating the grain direction of the veneers from layer to layer, or “cross-orienting”, panel strength and stiffness in both directions are maximized. Other structural wood panels include oriented strand board and structural composite panels.|$|E
50|$|Laminated veneer lumber (LVL) is an <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> {{that uses}} {{multiple}} layers of thin wood assembled with adhesives. It is typically used for headers, beams, rimboard, and edge-forming material. LVL offers several advantages over typical milled lumber: Made in a factory under controlled specifications, it is stronger, straighter, and more uniform. Due to its composite nature, it is much less likely than conventional lumber to warp, twist, bow, or shrink.|$|E

50|$|Particle board, {{also known}} as {{particleboard}} and chipboard, is an <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> manufactured from wood chips, sawmill shavings, or even sawdust, and a synthetic resin or other suitable binder, which is pressed and extruded. Oriented strand board, {{also known as}} flakeboard, waferboard, or chipboard, is similar but uses machined wood flakes offering more strength. All of these are composite materials that belong to the spectrum of fiberboard products.|$|E
50|$|Medium-density {{fibreboard}} (MDF) is an <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> made {{by breaking}} down hardwood or softwood residuals into wood fibres, {{often in a}} defibrator, combining it with wax and a resin binder, and forming panels by applying high temperature and pressure.

40|$|While wood is indisputably {{the most}} {{sustainable}} building material {{used in the}} Built Environment, very little of it is recycled {{at the end of}} a building’s life. Although both lumber quality and supply continue to decline annually, we persist with our view of wood only as a disposable commodity that is more easily replaced than recycled. This thesis rethinks the ways we create, use, and ultimately dispose of <b>wood</b> and <b>Engineered</b> <b>Wood</b> <b>Products</b> (EWPs) and highlights the many inherent advantages - both existing and potential - that future <b>Engineered</b> <b>Wood</b> <b>Products</b> might offer in an architectural context. The use of recycled waste wood fiber in EWP’s could eliminate the most energy intensive portions of the production process. The development of recycled supply streams would relieve pressure on our forests, allowing them to better fulfill their carbon sequestering potential. As <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>products</b> are refined through more frequent and varied application, their identity as wood elements evolves as well.

5000|$|An {{engineered}} wood joist, more {{commonly known as}} an I-joist, is a product designed to eliminate problems that occur with conventional wood joists. Invented in 1969, the I-joist is an <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> that has great strength in relation to its size and weight. The biggest notable difference from dimensional lumber is that the I-joist carries heavy loads with less lumber than a dimensional solid wood joist. As of 2005, approximately 50% of all wood light framed floors used I-joists. I-joists were designed to help eliminate typical problems that come with using solid lumber as joists.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{cross-laminated}} timber (CLT) is a prefabricated solid <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> made of {{at least}} three orthogonally bonded layers of solid-sawn lumber or structural composite lumber that are laminated by gluing of longitudinal and transverse layers with structural adhesives to form a solid rectangular-shaped, straight, and plane timber intended for roof, floor, or wall applications. While this <b>engineered</b> <b>wood</b> <b>product</b> has been used in Europe for over 15 years, the production of CLT and design of CLT structural systems have just begun in North America. For the acceptance of new construction materials or systems in North America, such as CLT, a consensus-based product standard is essential to the designers and regulatory bodies. This paper describes and documents the background information and some key issues that were considered during the development of the ANSI/APA PRG 320 Standard for Performance-Rated Cross Laminated Timber.
