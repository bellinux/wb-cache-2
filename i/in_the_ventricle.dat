60|$|Section 8. It {{might be}} {{inferred}} from this that pure and impure blood mix <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ventricle,</b> and that a blood of uniform quality flows to lungs, head, and extremities; {{but this is not}} so. The spongy nature of the ventricle sufficiently retards this mixing. It will be noted that the opening of pulmonary arteries lies nearest to the heart, next come the aortic and carotid arches, which have a common opening at A. Furthermore, at c.g.l. [the carotid artery, repeatedly divides to form a close meshwork of arterioles, the carotid gland, forming a sponge-like plug in this vessel.] is a spongy mass of matter, the carotid gland inserted upon the carotid. Hence the pulmonary arteries yawn nearest for the blood, and, being short, wide vessels, present the least resistance to the first rush of blood-- mainly venous blood for the right auricle. As they fill up, the back resistance in them becomes equal, and then greater, than the resistance at A, and the rush of blood, now of a mixed quality passes through that aperture. It selects the dorsal aorta, because the carotid arch, plugged by the carotid gland, offers the greater resistance. Presently, however, the back resistance of the filled dorsal aorta rises above this, and the last flow of blood, from the ventricular systole-- almost purely oxygenated blood for the left auricle-- goes on towards the head.|$|E
60|$|Section 44. The {{beating of}} the heart is, of course, a {{succession}} of contractions and expansions of its muscular wall. The contraction, or systole, commences {{at the base of}} the venae cavae and passes to the auricles, driving the blood before it into the ventricles, which then contract sharply and drive it on into the aorta or pulmonary artery; a pause and then a dilatation, the diastole follows. The flow of the blood is determined in one direction by the various valves {{of the heart}}. No valves occur in the opening of the superior cavae but an imperfect one, the Eustachian valve, protects the inferior cava; the direction of the heart's contraction prevents any excessive back-flow into the veins, and the onward, tendency is encouraged by the suck of the diastole of the ventricles. Between the left ventricle and auricle is a valve made up of two flaps of skin, the mitral valve, the edges of the flaps being connected with the walls of the ventricle through the intermediation of small muscular threads, the chordae tendinae, which stretch across its cavity to little muscular pillars, the papillary muscles; these attachments prevent the mitral valve from flapping back into the auricle, and as the blood flows into and accumulates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ventricle</b> it gets behind the flaps of the valve and presses its edges together. When the systole of the ventricle occurs, the increased, tension of the blood only closes the aperture the tighter, and the current passes on into the aorta, where we find three watch-pocket valves, with the pocket turned away from the heart, which are also closed and tightened by any attempt at regurgitation (back-flow). A similar process occurs on the right side of the heart, but here, instead of a mitral valve of two flaps between auricle and ventricle, we have a tricuspid valve with three. The thickness of the muscular walls, in view of the lesser distance through which it has to force the blood, -are- [is] less for the right ventricle than the left.|$|E

50|$|During development, the {{majority}} of the heart muscle is a sponge-like meshwork of interwoven myocardial fibers. As normal development progresses, these trabeculated structures undergo significant compaction that transforms them from spongy to solid.

50|$|With {{the advent}} of lungs came a {{partitioning}} of the atrium into two parts divided by a septum.

50|$|The {{pumping action}} of the heart then {{transports}} the blood around the body. As the left ventricle of the heart contracts, the volume decreases, which increases the pressure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ventricle.</b> This creates a pressure gradient between {{the heart and the}} capillaries, and blood moves through blood vessels by bulk flow (down the pressure gradient). As the thoracic cavity contracts during expiration, the volume of the alveoli decreases and creates a pressure gradient between the alveoli and the air outside the body, and air moves by bulk flow down the pressure gradient.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY The {{evolution}} of myocardial infarction 24 hours after ligating both the right coronary artery and the obtuse marginal {{branch of the}} left circumflex coronary artery was examined in 33 anesthetized dogs. Postmortem coronary angiography and a tracer microsphere technique {{were used to determine}} risk areas and their collateral blood flows, respectively. The mean weight of the risk areas was 11. 3 ± 0. 5 g (mean ± SEM) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right <b>ventricle</b> and 10. 5 ± 0. 9 g <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left <b>ventricle</b> (NS). <b>The</b> weight of infarcted tissue was 5. 7 ± 0. 7 g <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right <b>ventricle</b> and 5. 2 ± 0. 9 g <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left <b>ventricle</b> (NS). <b>In</b> both ventricles, infarct weight was linearly related to risk area size, and the percent of risk area necrosis was inversely correlated with the extent of collateral flow at 24 hours of coronary ligation, defined as the mean myocardial blood flow inside the central risk area. Ratios of infarct to risk area between the subendocardial and subepicardial layers were 0. 76 ± 0. 06 and 0. 28 ± 0. 05 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right and left ventricles, respectively (p < 0. 01, between ventricles, n = 31), which coincided well with subendocardial-to-subepicardial-flow ratios at 24 hours, ie, 0. 86 ± 0. 04 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> right <b>ventricle</b> and 0. 32 ± 0. 06 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left <b>ventricle</b> (p < 0. 01).

50|$|Cardiac {{dysrhythmia}} is {{an irregular}} heartbeat {{that can occur}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ventricles</b> or atria. Normally the heartbeat is initiated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> SA node of the atrium but initiation can also occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Purkinje fibres of <b>the</b> <b>ventricles</b> giving rise to premature ventricular contractions, also called ventricular extra beats. When these beats become grouped the condition is known as ventricular tachycardia.|$|R
50|$|There {{are four}} {{different}} named patterns of regularly occurring PVCs. Depending {{whether there are}} 1, 2, or 3 normal beats between each PVC, the rhythm is called bigeminy, trigeminy, or quadrigeminy. Unifocal PVCs are triggered from a single site <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ventricle,</b> causing the peaks on the ECG to look the same. Multifocal PVCs arise when more than one site in the ventricles initiate depolarization, causing each peak on the ECG {{to have a different}} shape. If 3 or more PVCs occur in a row it may be called ventricular tachycardia.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} phase of {{ventricular}} diastole, as the ventricular muscle relaxes, {{pressure on the}} remaining blood within the ventricle begins to fall. When pressure within the ventricles drops below pressure in both the pulmonary trunk and aorta, blood flows back toward the heart, producing the dicrotic notch (small dip) seen in blood pressure tracings. The semilunar valves close to prevent backflow into the heart. Since the atrioventricular valves remain closed at this point, there is {{no change in the}} volume of blood <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ventricle,</b> so the early phase of ventricular diastole is called the isovolumic ventricular relaxation phase, also called isovolumetric ventricular relaxation phase.|$|E
50|$|Initially, as {{the muscles}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ventricle</b> contract, the {{pressure}} of the blood within the chamber rises, but it is not yet high enough to open the semilunar (pulmonary and aortic) valves and be ejected from the heart. However, blood pressure quickly rises above that of the atria that are now relaxed and in diastole. This increase in pressure causes blood to flow back toward the atria, closing the tricuspid and mitral valves. Since blood is not being ejected from the ventricles at this early stage, the volume of blood within the chamber remains constant. Consequently, this initial phase of ventricular systole is known as isovolumic contraction, also called isovolumetric contraction.|$|E
50|$|Often colpocephaly {{occurs as}} a result of {{treating}} hydrocephalus. Hydrocephalus is the accumulation of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ventricles</b> or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> subarachnoid space over the brain. A shunt is inserted into <b>the</b> <b>ventricles,</b> which drains <b>the</b> excessive fluid into other body cavities to be absorbed by the blood. The increased pressure due to this condition dilates occipital horns causing colpocephaly.|$|R
50|$|It is {{not very}} well known how the {{electric}} signal moves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atria. It seems that it moves in a radial way, but Bachmann's bundle and coronary sinus muscle play a role <b>in</b> conduction between <b>the</b> two atria, which have a nearly simultaneous systole. While <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ventricles,</b> <b>the</b> signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the myocardium.|$|R
40|$|The cardiac {{neuronal}} norepinephrine (NE) transporter (NET) in sympathetic neurons {{is responsible}} for uptake of released NE from the neuroeffector junction. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the chamber distribution of cardiac NET protein measured using [3 H]nisoxetine binding in rat heart membranes and to correlate NE content to NET amount. In whole mounts of atria, NET was colocalized in nerve fibers with tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) immunoreactivity. NE content expressed as micrograms NE per gram tissue was lowest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ventricles; however, NET binding was significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> left <b>ventricle</b> than <b>the</b> right <b>ventricle</b> and atria (P < 0. 05), resulting in a significant negative correlation (r 2 = 0. 922; P < 0. 05) of NET to NE content. The neurotoxin 6 -hydroxydopamine, an NET substrate, reduced NE content more <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ventricles</b> than <b>the</b> atria, demonstrating functional significance of high ventricular NET binding. In summary, there is a ventricular predominance of NET binding that corresponds to a high NE reuptake capacity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ventricles,</b> yet negatively correlates to tissue NE content...|$|R
