It is found that the time delay variation of 100 kHz Loran-C pulses may be representative of electrical conductivity changes along the propagation path, which have a direct link with soil and sea surface properties. The validation studies using Loran-C signals recorded at Bath and Harwich clearly show that the proposed method is capable of producing an estimation of soil moisture and sea surface salinity.

Both L-band airborne and X-band spaceborne radars are studied, using the NASA UAVSAR and the German TerraSAR-X platforms. Feature detection and classification algorithms tested for this application include both radiometric and textural methods. Radiometric features include both the simple backscatter magnitudes of the HH, VV, and HV channels as well as decompositions such as Entropy, Anisotropy, and Alpha angle. Textural methods include grey-level co-occurrence matrix and wavelet features. Classifiers tested include Maximum Likelihood and Artificial Neural Networks.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new method to {{determine}} the soil surface crust resistance in situ. The method {{is based on the}} assumption that the crust is well established prior to the infiltration. In this case, and for steady infiltration regime the hydraulic resistance of the crust, can be inferred from the infiltration rate and the relationship between soil conductivity and water pressure head. The proposed method combines two types of in situ experiments: (i) rain simulation experiments; and (ii) single ring infiltration tests on the same soil after removal of the crust in order to assess the soil hydraulic properties. The effectiveness of the proposed methodology was tested by reproducing numerically the experiments. The comparison of the numerical results with observations was satisfactory. <b>Further</b> <b>validation</b> <b>and</b> tests on other soil types are required in order to confirm our results...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{biomarkers}} {{for prostate}} cancer (PCa) screening, detection, and prognostication have revolutionized the diagnosis {{and management of the}} disease. Current clinical practice has been driven largely by the utilization of prostate-specific antigen (PSA). The lack of specificity of PSA for PCa has led to both unnecessary biopsies and overdiagnosis of indolent cancers. The recent controversial recommendation by the United States Preventive Services Task Force against PCa screening has highlighted the need for novel clinically useful biomarkers. We review the literature on PCa biomarkers in serum, urine, and tissue. While these markers show promise, none seems poised to replace PSA, but rather may augment it. <b>Further</b> <b>validation</b> <b>and</b> consideration of how these novel markers improve clinical outcome is necessary.

We use two-dimensional electrophoresis (2 -DE) combined with MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry to compare the proteome between lung cancer cell line A 549 and its cisplatin-resistant subline A 549 /DDP. Nine cisplatin resistance-related proteins were identified, and DJ- 1, one of the differently expressed proteins, was selected for <b>further</b> <b>validation</b> <b>and</b> evaluation.
