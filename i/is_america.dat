5|$|Taking {{advantage}} {{of the existence of}} 30 years of newsreels archives were filmmakers who made early sound era documentaries. World War I was a popular topic of these pictures and spawned the following documentaries; The Big Drive (1933), World in Revolt (1933), This <b>is</b> <b>America</b> (1933), and Hell's Holiday (1933). The most prescient pre-Code World War I documentary was aptly called The First World War (1934) and was the most critically and commercially successful documentary of the era.|$|E

25|$|By the mid-1990s, the specials' {{popularity}} {{had begun}} to wane, and CBS showed disinterest in new specials, even rejecting It's Spring Training, Charlie Brown completely. An eight-episode TV miniseries called This <b>is</b> <b>America,</b> Charlie Brown, for instance, was released during a writer's strike. Also, NBC aired You're in the Super Bowl, Charlie Brown in 1994 (the first special not to air on CBS) ten days before Super Bowl XXVIII. Eventually, the last Peanuts specials made during Schulz' lifetime were released direct-to-video, and no new ones were created until after the year 2000 when ABC obtained {{the rights to the}} three fall holiday specials. The Nickelodeon cable network re-aired a package of most of the specials produced before 1992, as well as The Charlie Brown and Snoopy Show and This <b>Is</b> <b>America,</b> Charlie Brown, under the umbrella title You're on Nickelodeon, Charlie Brown between 1997 and 2001.|$|E

500|$|University of Texas {{economist}} James K.

Stossel denied any misrepresentation of Galbraith's views and stated that it was not his intention to convey that Galbraith agreed with all of the special's ideas. However, he re-edited that portion of the program for its September 2000 repeat, in which Stossel paraphrased, [...] "Even economists who like Europe's policies, like James Galbraith, now acknowledge America's success." ...|$|E

It pre-dates the band’s reunion, and was a guitar riff DeLonge kept around to expand upon in the future. The song's coda was composed by Barker and engineer Chris Holmes. Hoppus composed two versions of [...] "Heart's All Gone", one fast and one slow, and ended up liking both, so the slower version serves as an interlude on the album's deluxe edition. [...] "Wishing Well" [...] was solely created by DeLonge, and is what Hoppus describes as the epitome of the album: [...] "It's very catchy, but the lyrics are really, really dark and a little depressing." [...] "Kaleidoscope" [...] arose when Hoppus woke up with the song's opening lyrics in his head, which he expanded into a Descendents-ish classic punk song. [...] "The mentality behind it is being a slacker in 2011," [...] Hoppus said. [...] "The 20s and 30s malaise that <b>is</b> <b>America</b> right now." [...] It was also inspired by the album's lengthy recording process and the transformation of the band. [...] "This Is Home" [...] was originally titled [...] "Scars to Blame", but changed considerably when Hoppus took the chorus and bridge and combined it with new lyrics written by DeLonge, morphing it into what he described as [...] "an anthem for youthful abandon." ...|$|E

2500|$|Even {{before the}} strike began, the press begged the unions to reconsider.
