5|$|Never before have I {{written to}} {{a player to}} express my regret at his {{omission}} from the Australian XI. <b>In</b> <b>your</b> <b>case</b> I am making an exception because I {{want you to know}} how much my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and {{will be the first to}} admit that your form has not been good.|$|E

2500|$|I was {{influenced}} so greatly by {{a television show}} in igniting the passion that I had as being a prosecutor, and it was Perry Mason … In one of the episodes, {{at the end of}} the episode … Perry said to the prosecutor, [...] "It must cause you some pain having expended all that effort <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>case</b> to have the charges dismissed." [...] And the prosecutor looked up and said, [...] "No. My job as a prosecutor is do justice and justice is served when a guilty man is convicted and when an innocent man is not." [...] And I thought to myself that's quite amazing to be able to serve that role … ...|$|E

6000|$|Captain Manley smiled. [...] "Pistols {{would not}} look the thing on a parade-ground, boys; but in a {{campaign}} people are not very particular, and I have no doubt the colonel will overlook any little breach of strict uniformity <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>cases,</b> as it is evident you can't carry muskets. You can use your pistols, I hope," [...] {{he said with a}} smile. [...] "Hit a penny every time at twenty paces!" ...|$|R

2500|$|Dissent cables are {{intended}} to be internal and not immediately made public, although leaks do occur. Some dissent cables are marked as sensitive but unclassified. Wayne Merry, a former U.S. diplomat who wrote a dissent cable in 1994 while posted to Russia, made a Freedom of Information Act request in 1999 {{for a copy of}} his own cable; the State Department denied the request in 2003 on the grounds that (1) [...] "release and public circulation of Dissent Channel messages, even as <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>case</b> to the drafter of the message, would inhibit the willingness of Department personnel to avail themselves of the Dissent Channel to express their views freely" [...] and (2) [...] "Dissent Channel messages are deliberative, pre-decisional and constitute intra-agency communications." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Australia's biggest {{defeat at}} home in 50 years the Australian press were in uproar and the {{selectors}} Ewart Macmillan, Jack Ryder and Don Bradman took drastic action, dropping the captain Brian Booth, batsman Bob Cowper and the bowlers Garth McKenzie, Peter Philpott and David Sincock. Booth {{received a letter from}} Bradman on behalf of the selectors explaining [...] "Never before have I written to a player to express my regret at his omission from the Australian XI. <b>In</b> <b>your</b> <b>case</b> I am making an exception because I want you to know how much my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and {{will be the first to}} admit that your form has not been good." [...] Booth had made only 84 runs (16.80) in the series and never played for Australia again. Cowper was blamed for slow scoring even though he had made 99 and 60 in the Second and Third Tests. Peter Allan of Queensland was brought back into the side after he had taken the third best bowling figures in Australia – 10/61 in the first innings against Victoria, but was injured and McKenzie was restored to the team. The off-spinner Tom Veivers and young batsmen Ian Chappell were called up and Keith Stackpole made his Test debut, so Australia went to Adelaide with only three specialist bowlers – McKenzie, Hawke and Veivers. England simply kept the same XI from Sydney, even though this meant that Geoff Boycott was their third place bowler after Jeff Jones and Dave Brown. Mike Smith won the toss and decided to bat.|$|E
2500|$|... is {{a ridiculous}} female {{character}} played by Tim Brooke-Taylor. Lady Constance is usually introduced by a statement {{along the lines}} of [...] "what is that coming towards us? – It's huge – It's a rhinoceros!" [...] – [...] "No, it's me!!!" [...] and this is often accompanied by a rousing rendition of [...] "Happy Days Are Here Again", and always by rousing cheers from the audience. Her size is legendary; in the [...] "Henry VIII" [...] sketch, Katharine of Aragon and Lady Constance (masquerading as Anne of Cleavage) fight a duel to decide who is to be Queen. [...] Brooke-Taylor introduces her in the style of a boxing MC: [...] "..and in the blue corner, at 15 hundredweight, your own, your very own – and there's enough to go round – twice -...". [...] In the [...] "Dentisti" [...] sketch, a parody on the 1960s TV series Daktari, Lady Constance plays (appropriately) an elephant; and in [...] "Jack The Ripper", Lady Constance is invited to: [...] "please, sit down anywhere ... or <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>case,</b> everywhere". In the [...] "Radio Prune Greek Tragedy" [...] sketch, she plays the mother of Oedipus Rex – according to the Oracle, she was hoping for a dog – and [...] she tells Oedipus: [...] "Now let me get on with my housework, I've got a little behind [...]." [...] (pause for the double-entendre to register) [...] ".. oh all right, I've got a colossal behind!!" [...] In the [...] "Colditz" [...] sketch, the lads' escape route is through the plug hole of her bath, and Bill Oddie exclaims [...] "She's like a ruddy great iceberg: one eighth above the water, 76 eighths below!". She also in her own way {{is a bit of a}} nymphomaniac – she's described in the 25th anniversary show version of [...] "Jack The Ripper" [...] as a steaming volcano of eroticism – and there are frequent references to unfulfilled sexual desire: in the [...] "3.17 to Cleethorpes" [...] sketch, she and the other players in the drama are adrift on a raft in the ocean; Lady Constance offers to take all her clothes off and use them for a sail, and when Hatch says, [...] "Yes, and then what?", Lady Constance replies, [...] "Well, that's rather up to you ...." ...|$|E

60|$|Thinking it may aid you a little, I {{send you}} one of our blank forms of Petitions. It, you will see, is framed to be sworn to before the Federal court clerk, and, <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>cases,</b> will have [to] be so far changed as to be sworn to before the clerk of your circuit court; and his {{certificate}} must be accompanied with his official seal. The schedules, too, must be attended to. Be sure that they contain the creditors' names, their residences, the amounts due each, the debtors' names, their residences, and the amounts they owe, also all property and where located.|$|R

6000|$|It is not {{indeed the}} common lot {{of man to}} make serious {{additions}} [...] to the friendships which so greatly help us in this pilgrimage, [...] after seventy-six years old; but I rejoice to think that <b>in</b> <b>your</b> [...] <b>case</b> it has been accomplished for me.|$|R
6000|$|... "But, my dear Miss Moultrie, I {{only know}} what I've seen, of course, {{but it seems}} to me that what you thought was a tragedy <b>in</b> <b>your</b> sister's <b>case,</b> turns out, on your own evidence, so to speak, to have been an accident--a dreadfully sad one--but {{absolutely}} an accident." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "This is {{a square}} sale, so square that I can see by the vendor's looks he would sooner realize half-value than countenance {{anything}} irregular.

50|$|There are two {{different}} ways of describing a misuse case textual; one is embedded in a use case description template - where you add an extra description field called Threats.
