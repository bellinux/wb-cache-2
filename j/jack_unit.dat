During the raid, Yoshimitsu lost his arm and was found by Bosconovitch who helped him escape and fitted him with a mechanical arm. Dr. Bosconovitch was kidnapped by Kazuya Mishima {{in the run-up to}} The King of Iron Fist Tournament 2 and was forced to work for him. Some of the many projects involved the creation of the bio-weapons Roger and Alex, as well as the completion of the Prototype <b>Jack</b> <b>unit.</b> He began the [...] "Cold Sleep" [...] project as a means of preserving his daughters body (who seemingly died) by using Nina Williams and Anna Williams as test subjects. After completing his tasks, and before being executed, Doctor Bosconovitch is rescued by the friend he helped save previously, Yoshimitsu. Nineteen years later, he contracted a rare disease that affects the spine as a result of working on his Cold Sleep project. In order to cure himself and to revive his daughter, he needed the blood of the fighting god, Ogre. He turned to an old friend, Yoshimitsu, for help. Yoshimitsu entered the King of Iron Fist Tournament 3 and was successful in obtaining a sample of Ogres blood after Jin Kazama had killed it. Dr. Bosconovitch appears in Bryan Furys Tekken 4 ending. In it, he explains to Bryan that he will now mechanize him and allow him to be completely reborn in a new incarnation. Bryan lays supine on the table and Bosconovitch holds a gun-shaped device containing sleeping gas. Bidding him sweet dreams, he injects the gas into Bryan. Throughout, he speaks in a calm and gentle tone. However, the doctor found Bryans body too complex, and he instead installed a perpetual generator. Bryan proceeded to attack the doctor, as well as Manji Clan members who were with him. While the members were slain, Bosconovitch survived, though he was severely injured. In Tekken 6, he creates an android in his daughters image, Alisa Bosconovitch.|$|E

In this paper we used the reliability analysis in order to estimate an optimal mining equipment repair/replacement policy by estimating their remaining useful life. The proportional hazard model was used in reliability analysis to be realistic and take the operational influencing factors in calculation. Methods are presented for calculating the conditional reliability function and computing the remaining useful life (RUL) {{as a function of}} the current conditions to guarantee the desired output. The model is applied in the hydraulic <b>jack</b> <b>unit</b> of LHD machine in an underground mine in Sweden. A Weibull proportional hazard model (PHM) with time-independent covariates was considered for the hazard function in an illustration of the proposed model. Presented results can be used, e. g. for developing of preventive maintenance plan or replacement intervals based on the conditional probability of failure or RUL.

40|$|Master's thesis in Petroleum engineeringThere {{are many}} options {{to perform a}} PP&A operation. The goal of this thesis was {{to look at the}} {{opportunities}} to perform an effective offline PP&A of wells based on cost, time and personnel. After searching through Service Company’s solution to the problem the final conclusion became Weatherford and their pulling and <b>jacking</b> <b>unit.</b> Based on time, personnel and cost this unit provides an offline solution plus leaving the drilling rig by itself to perform other well operations simultaneously. The biggest concern of Statoil is to not have all wells PP&A when production stops at the end of 2016. If operation is still running when the field is no longer producing the average day-rate will increase from 1. 1 million NOK to 2. 6 million NOK according to calculations performed internal in Statoil. This makes time of performing a PP&A operation the most important number to get as low as possible. A conventional method takes between 45 - 50 days to finish and 40 days if the conductor {{does not need to be}} pulled. This means that if Statoil want to finish PP&A Statfjord A before production stops in 2016 Statoil needs to start PP&A wells in the summer 2012. In addition to the pulling and <b>jacking</b> <b>unit</b> it is suggested to use a coiled tubing unit to perform cementing operations provides a complete package to a PP&A operation. Cementing on coiled tubing has never been done at Statfjord before and this will be a breakthrough when it comes to PP&A in Statoil. Using coiled tubing to perform cementing job is widely used by other operator company with great success. It is now time for Statoil to also take advantage of the possibilities provided by coiled tubing. Using two units instead of one drilling rig will be a more costly operation, but will provide a much faster and effective operation. When decommissioning an entire field it is important not to rush, but have a systematically approach to the operation. One of the most important factors to create the most effective abandonment procedure is to have a scheduled plan of the wells plugging order. Separating the wells into batches and starting with the wells not producing and saving the wells actually producing for as long as possible will create an effective decommissioning operation. This may not be the most effective method by logistic, but will provide a stable income during the operations and overall lower the total cost. Based on experience from other fields, such as the Hutton field decommissioning by BP, shows that training of personnel and planning ahead of the operation is very important for the success of the operation. Making the crew personnel familiar with the facilities on the platform and equipment has proven to be of great value. In addition to suggesting new equipment to perform a PP&A operation this thesis also suggest a new procedure of plugging wells. Many of the steps are similar to the conventional method, but there are two main features to the new procedure. First the 7 ” tubing and 9 5 / 8 ” is cut above the normal pressure zone. Common practice is to cut the tubing a few meters above the production packer, but cutting it above the normal pressure zone will provide much less pipe handling and a much quicker pulling time. In addition to save time and logistical issues cutting the tubing and 9 5 / 8 ” casing above the normal pressure zone will remove the need for a BOP for the rest of the operations. Similar to when drilling a well down to this depth without a BOP, a PP&A operation can be performed without a BOP upward from this point. On Statfjord this normal pressure point is at around 1400 m depth. The basics steps of the new proposed PP&A operation are with these points in mind as followed: 1. 	Log cement bonding and tubing condition on WL 2. 	Cut Tubing on WL 3. 	Displace well to seawater 4. 	Set cement plug in tubing by CT 5. 	Pull tubing by PJU 6. 	Log 9 5 / 8 ” casing by WL through PJU 7. 	Cut casing by WL through PJU 8. 	Pull casing by PJU 9. 	Log 13 3 / 8 ” casing by WL through PJU 10. 	Cut casing by WL through PJU 11. 	Pull casing by PJU 12. 	Set surface cement plug and pull conductors by CT Not included in these steps are the setting and pulling of DHSV and mechanical plugs. There is also assumed good cement behind casing showed by each logging run. Contingency plans when cement is inadequate are discussed in the thesis. 1. 1 	Conclusion Based on the proposed method and usage of the pulling and <b>jacking</b> <b>unit</b> along with cementing on coiled tubing the following results of time, cost and personnel was established; 1. 1. 1 	Time Including the pulling of conductor a conventional method require 45 - 50 days to complete the PP&A operation. Time of the new proposed method is estimated based on history and internal experience and resulting in a total operation time of 28 days. This means that PP&A operations may start in the last quarter of 2012 and still finish early in 2016 with all 40 wells resulting in a massive cost saving for Statoil. 1. 1. 2 	Cost To calculate the cost of a conventional PP&A method Statoil used historical data and finds an average day-rate to be multiplied with time estimations. This cost estimated day-rate is set to be 1. 1 million NOK per day and include all from equipment to personnel. Since the proposed units have never been used before in Statoil the cost calculations for the new method cannot be based upon historical data. Cost calculations have therefore been calculated in details and result showing a day-rate of 2. 5 million NOK. This is much higher than the conventional method, but is much more unreliable plus the method takes less time. How much the actual cost will turn out to be is difficult to predict, but as of now the starting point should be 2. 5 million NOK per day. 1. 1. 3 	Personnel A normal rig crew working on the drilling rig consists approximately of 35 people. The new proposed method requires only 18 people. This is half of the people required by the conventional method and will create a daily saving of approximately 250 000 NOK per day. During the whole PP&A campaign this will result in major cost savings overall...|$|R
