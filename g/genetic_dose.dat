One {{example is the}} C. elegans vulva, in which the final cell fate pattern is remarkably robust. Although this system has been extensively studied and the molecular network underlying cell fate specification is well understood, very little is known in quantitative terms. Here, through pathway dosage modulation and single molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization, we show that the system can tolerate a 4 -fold variation in <b>genetic</b> <b>dose</b> of the upstream signaling molecule LIN- 3 /epidermal growth factor (EGF) without phenotypic change in cell fate pattern. Furthermore, through tissuespecific dosage perturbations of the EGF and Notch pathways, we determine the first-appearing patterning errors. Finally, by combining different doses of both pathways, we explore how quantitative pathway interactions influence system behavior. Our results highlight the feasibility and significance of launching experimental studies of robustness and quantitative network analysis in genetically tractable, multicellular eukaryotes...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of the mammalian skull is a complex process that requires multiple tissue interactions and a balance of growth and differentiation. Disrupting this balance can lead {{to changes in the}} shape and size of skull bones, which can have serious clinical implications. For example, insufficient ossification of the bony elements leads to enlarged anterior fontanelles and reduced mechanical protection of the brain. In this report, we find that loss of Gsk 3 β leads to a fully penetrant reduction of frontal bone size and subsequent enlarged frontal fontanelle. In the absence of Gsk 3 β the frontal bone primordium undergoes increased cell death and reduced proliferation with a concomitant increase in Fgfr 2 -IIIc and Twist 1 expression. This leads to a smaller condensation and premature differentiation. This phenotype appears to be Wnt-independent and is not rescued by decreasing the <b>genetic</b> <b>dose</b> of β-catenin/Ctnnb 1. Taken together, our work defines a novel role for Gsk 3 β in skull development...|$|E

Molecular genetic analyses have revealed that interactions between mutations in the genes encoding the RET receptor tyrosine kinase and the endothelin receptor type B (EDNRB) {{are central to the}} genesis of HSCR. We have established two locus noncomplementation assays in mice, using allelic series at Ednrb in the context of Ret kinase-null heterozygotes, to understand the clinical presentation, incomplete penetrance, variation in length of aganglionic segment, and sex bias observed in human HSCR patients. Titration of Ednrb in the presence of half the <b>genetic</b> <b>dose</b> of Ret determines the presentation of an enteric phenotype in these strains, revealing or abrogating a sex bias in disease expression depending on the genotype at Ednrb. RET and EDNRB signaling pathways are also critical for the normal development of other tissues, including the kidneys and neural crest-derived melanocytes. Our data demonstrate that interaction between these genes is restricted to the enteric nervous system and does not affect renal, coat color, and retinal choroid development...|$|E

40|$|The anticoagulant, {{activated}} protein C (aPC), possesses antithrombotic, profibrinolytic, anti-inflammatory, and antiapoptotic properties, and {{the level}} of this protein is an important marker of acute inflammatory responses. Although infusion of aPC improves survival in a subset of patients with severe sepsis, evidence as to how aPC decreases mortality in these cases is limited. Because a total deficiency of PC shows complete neonatal lethality, no animal model currently exists to address the mechanistic relationships between very low endogenous aPC levels and inflammatory diseases. Here, we show {{for the first time that}} novel <b>genetic</b> <b>dosing</b> of PC strongly correlates with survival outcomes following endotoxin (LPS) challenge in mice. The data provide evidence that very low endogenous levels of PC predispose mice to early-onset disseminated intravascular coagulation, thrombocytopenia, hypotension, organ damage, and reduced survival after LPS challenge. Furthermore, evidence of an exacerbated inflammatory response is observed in very low PC mice but is greatly reduced in wild-type cohorts. Reconstitution of low-PC mice with recombinant human aPC improves hypotension and extends survival after LPS challenge. This study directly links host endogenous levels of PC with various coagulation, inflammation, and hemodynamic end points following a severe acute inflammatory challenge...|$|R

By contrast, Drosophila epithelial tissues lacking the TSG 101 ortholog erupted (ept) develop as enlarged undifferentiated tumors, indicating that the gene can have anti-growth properties in a simple metazoan. A full understanding of pathways deregulated by loss of Drosophila ept will aid in understanding potential links between mammalian TSG 101 and growth control.

40|$|Many {{inhibitor}} of apoptosis (IAP) family proteins inhibit apoptosis. IAPs contain N-terminal baculovirus IAP repeat domains and a C-terminal RING ubiquitin ligase domain. Drosophila IAP DIAP 1 {{is essential}} for the survival of many cells, protecting them from apoptosis by inhibiting active caspases. Apoptosis initiates when proteins such as Reaper, Hid, and Grim bind a surface groove in DIAP 1 baculovirus IAP repeat domains via an N-terminal IAP-binding motif. This evolutionarily conserved interaction disrupts DIAP 1 -caspase interactions, unleashing apoptosis-inducing caspase activity. A second Drosophila IAP, DIAP 2, also binds Rpr and Hid and inhibits apoptosis in multiple contexts when overexpressed. However, {{due to a lack of}} mutants, little is known about the normal functions of DIAP 2. We report the generation of diap 2 null mutants. These flies are viable and show no defects in developmental or stress-induced apoptosis. Instead, DIAP 2 is required for the innate immune response to Gram-negative bacterial infection. DIAP 2 promotes cytoplasmic cleavage and nuclear translocation of the NF-{kappa}B homolog Relish, and this requires the DIAP 2 RING domain. Increasing the <b>genetic</b> <b>dose</b> of diap 2 results in an increased immune response, whereas expression of Rpr or Hid results in down-regulation of DIAP 2 protein levels. Together these observations suggest that DIAP 2 can regulate immune signaling in a dose-dependent manner, and this can be regulated by IBM-containing proteins. Therefore, diap 2 may identify a point of convergence between apoptosis and immune signaling pathways...|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that drug {{responses}} differ among patients with regard to dose requirements, efficacy, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs). The differences in drug responses are partially explained by genetic variation. This paper highlights some examples of areas in which the different responses (dose, efficacy, and ADRs) are studied in children, including cancer (cisplatin), thrombosis (vitamin K antagonists), and asthma (long-acting β 2 agonists). For childhood cancer, the replication of data is challenging due to a high heterogeneity in study populations, which is mostly due to all the different treatment protocols. For example, the replication cohorts of the association of variants in TPMT and COMT with cisplatin-induced ototoxicity gave conflicting results, possibly {{as a result of this}} heterogeneity. For the vitamin K antagonists, the evidence of the association between variants in VKORC 1 and CYP 2 C 9 and the <b>dose</b> is clear. <b>Genetic</b> <b>dosing</b> models have been developed, but the implementation is held back by the impossibility of conducting a randomized controlled trial with such a small and diverse population. For the long-acting β 2 agonists, there is enough evidence for the association between variant ADRB 2 Arg 16 and treatment response to start clinical trials to assess clinical value and cost effectiveness of genotyping. However, further research is still needed to define the different asthma phenotypes to study associations in comparable cohorts.

40|$|Major strides {{have been}} taken in the {{regulation}} of lead intoxication in the general population, but studies using genetic markers of susceptibility to environmental toxicants {{raise the question of}} whether genes can make certain individuals more vulnerable to environmental toxins such as lead. At least three polymorphic genes have been identified that potentially can influence the bioaccumulation and toxicokinetics of lead in humans. The first gene to be discussed in this review is the gene coding for 6 -aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD), an enzyme of heme biosynthesis, that exists in two polymorphic forms. The resulting isozymes have been shown to affect the blood and bone lead levels in human populations. The effects of ALAD in lead intoxication have also been studied in laboratory mice that differ in the <b>genetic</b> <b>dose</b> for this enzyme. The second gene reviewed here is the vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene. The VDR is involved in calcium absorption through the gut and into calcium-rich tissues such as bone. Recent findings suggest that VDR polymorphism may influence the accumulation of lead in bone. Finally, the third gene to be discussed here that may influence the absorption of lead is the hemochromatosis gene coding for the HFE protein. The presence of mutations in the HFE gene leads to hemochromatosis in homozygotic individuals. Because of the associations between iron and lead transport, it is possible that polymorphisms in the HFE gene may also influence the absorption of lead, but this has not yet been studied. More studies will be needed to define the role of these genes in lead intoxication.

40|$|Patterning of C. elegans vulval cell fates {{relies on}} {{inductive}} signaling. In this induction event, a single cell, the gonadal anchor cell, secretes LIN- 3 /EGF and induces {{three out of}} six competent precursor cells to acquire a vulval fate. We previously showed that this developmental system is robust to a four-fold variation in lin- 3 /EGF <b>genetic</b> <b>dose.</b> Here using single-molecule FISH, {{we find that the}} mean level of expression of lin- 3 in the anchor cell is remarkably conserved. No change in lin- 3 expression level could be detected among C. elegans wild isolates and only a low level of change-less than 30 %-in the Caenorhabditis genus and in Oscheius tipulae. In C. elegans, lin- 3 expression in the anchor cell is known to require three transcription factor binding sites, specifically two E-boxes and a nuclear-hormone-receptor (NHR) binding site. Mutation of any of these three elements in C. elegans results in a dramatic decrease in lin- 3 expression. Yet only a single E-box is found in the Drosophilae supergroup of Caenorhabditis species, including C. angaria, while the NHR-binding site likely only evolved {{at the base of the}} Elegans group. We find that a transgene from C. angaria bearing a single E-box is sufficient for normal expression in C. elegans. Even a short 58 bp cis-regulatory fragment from C. angaria with this single E-box is able to replace the three transcription factor binding sites at the endogenous C. elegans lin- 3 locus, resulting in the wild-type expression level. Thus, regulatory evolution occurring in cis within a 58 bp lin- 3 fragment, results in a strict requirement for the NHR binding site and a second E-box in C. elegans. This single-cell, single-molecule, quantitative and functional evo-devo study demonstrates that conserved expression levels can hide extensive change in cis-regulatory site requirements and highlights the evolution of new cis-regulatory elements required for cell-specific gene expression...|$|E

The gene encoding HSD 10, HSD 17 B 10, has been reported {{as one of the}} few genes that escapes X-inactivation. We previously studied two females with HSD 10 deficiency, one of them was severely affected and the other presented a mild phenotype. To elucidate why these two carriers were so differently affected, cDNA analyses were performed. The HSD 17 B 10 cDNA of eight control cell lines, two hemizygous patients and two carriers was obtained from cultured fibroblasts, amplified by PCR and sequenced by standard methods. All HSD 17 B 10 cDNAs were quantified by real-time PCR. In the fibroblasts of the female who presented with the severe phenotype, only the mutant allele was identified in the cDNA sequence which was further confirmed by Relative Quantification (RQ) of HSD 17 B 10 cDNA. This is in agreement with an unfavourable X-inactivation. The other female, with slight clinical affectation, showed the presence of both mutant and wild-type alleles in the cDNA sequence, which was confirmed by RQ of HSD 17 B 10 cDNA in fibroblasts. This result could be explained by the presence of a mosaicism. In addition, RQ results of HSD 17 B 10 cDNA did not differ significantly between unaffected males and females, which indicates that the <b>genetic</b> <b>doses</b> of mRNA of HSD 17 B 10 was the same in both sexes.

40|$|The cut gene of Drosophila melanogaster encodes a {{homeodomain}} {{protein that}} regulates a soma-to-germline signaling pathway required for proper morphology of germline cells during oogenesis. cut is required solely in somatic follicle cells, and when cut function is disrupted, membranes separating adjacent nurse cells {{break down and}} the structural integrity of the actin cytoskeleton is compromised. To understand the mechanism by which cut expression influences germline cell morphology, we determined whether binucleate cells form by defective cytokinesis or by fusion of adjacent cells. Egg chambers produced by cut, cappuccino, and chickadee mutants contained binucleate cells in which ring canal remnants stained with antibodies against Hu-li tai shao and Kelch, two proteins that are added to ring canals after cytokinesis is complete. In addition, defects in egg chamber morphology were observed only in middle to late stages of oogenesis, suggesting that germline cell cytokineses were normal in these mutants. cut exhibited dose-sensitive genetic interactions with cappuccino but not with chickadee or other genes that regulate cytoskeletal function, including armadillo, spaghetti squash, quail, spire, Src 64 B, and Tec 29 A. Genomic regions containing genes that cooperate with cut were identified by performing a second-site noncomplementing screen using a collection of chromosomal deficiencies. Sixteen regions that interact with cut during oogenesis and eight regions that interact during the development of other tissues were identified. Genetic interactions between cut and the ovarian tumor gene were identified {{as a result of}} the screen. In addition, the gene agnostic was found to be required during oogenesis, and genetic interactions between cut and agnostic were revealed. These results demonstrate that a signaling pathway regulating the morphology of germline cells is sensitive to <b>genetic</b> <b>doses</b> of cut and the genes cappuccino, ovarian tumor, and agnostic.

40|$|Purpose: To {{retrospectively}} {{analyze the}} radiation doses delivered to patients undergoing fluoroscopy examinations {{in terms of}} the skin dose and the dose-area product (DAP). Materials and Methods: The subjects of this study were patients who underwent fluoroscopy examinations at Charlotte Maxeke Johannesburg Academic Hospital, South Africa during the period August 2007 to March 2008. The skin dose and dose-area product values were obtained from a built-in DAP-meter installed on a digital Philips Medical Systems MultiDiagnost Eleva fluoroscopy unit. The following cases were analyzed namely barium swallow, barium meal, barium enema, hexabrix swallow, gastrografin meal, voiding cystourethrogram, fistulogram, myelogram, nephrostomy and loopogram. Results: An analysis of three hundred and thirty one examinations is presented. From the recorded data the following quantities were deduced: the mean- and range of the skin doses and DAPs, mean screening time and mean fluoroscopy duration. An analysis of the screening time for the various examinations showed a weak correlation (r = 0. 59) between skin dose and screening time, while a poor correlation (r = 0. 42) was deduced between DAP reading and screening time. Conclusion: There is a wide spread in the radiation doses registered for any one given type of examination. The large variability in the radiation dose delivered proves that fluoroscopic examinations stand to gain from dose optimization. The usefulness and potential use of DAP meters with regards to dose optimization in radiology is shown. In line with efforts to optimize dose from diagnostic radiography examinations the authors recommend the establishment of diagnostic reference levels (DRLs) in South Africa for the most frequent examinations in general radiography, fluoroscopy, mammography and computed tomography.

Materials and methods: Bone marrow from two strains of mice (CBA and C 57) were exposed to a range of X-ray doses (0, 0. 01, 0. 1, 1 and 3 Gy). Different cellular signalling endpoints: Apoptosis, cytokine levels and calcium flux, were evaluated at 2 h, 24 h and 7 d post-irradiation to assess immediate and delayed effects. Results: In CBA (radiosensitive) elevated apoptosis levels were observed at 24 h post X-irradiation, and transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) levels which increased with time and dose. C 57 showed a higher background level of apoptosis, and sustained apoptotic levels 7 days after radiation exposure. Levels of tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α were increased in C 57 at day 7 for higher X-ray doses. TGF-β levels were higher in CBA, whilst C 57 exhibited a greater TNF-α response.

In each childhood cancer in age group at death, 0 - 5, 6 - 9 and 10 - 15 years, excess cancer deaths decreased suddenly for births in and after 1958. A major factor was concerted action initiated in 1956 to reduce radiation exposure of fetal gonads for fear of <b>genetic</b> hazards. <b>Dose</b> reduction was achieved during 1957 and early 1958 by reducing the rising rate of obstetric radiography and by virtually abandoning pelvimetry as that had been understood. In the 1970 s the rate of X-raying increased again and so did cancer risk but not significantly. Direct evidence that diagnostic X-rays can cause childhood cancer is the similar excess rate per X-ray in twins and singleton births when X-raying rate is 5 - 6 times higher in twins. In the past a dose-response for cancer in OSCC data based on number of films per X-ray examination was taken to be evidence for causation but dose per film varies with kind of X-ray examination.

Patients homozygous for the epsilon 2 allele required 3. 5 mg (95 %CI: 0. 1 to 6. 9) acenocoumarol per week more than patients with genotype epsilon 3 /epsilon 3. The acenocoumarol maintenance dose showed a gene dose effect of the epsilon 4 allele, but not of the epsilon 2 allele. No significant dose difference was observed for phenprocoumon, possibly because of low numbers. CONCLUSION: The ApoE genotype affects the dose requirements of acenocoumarol...|$|R

We investigated the influence of polymorphisms over time. An initial oral dose of modified-release once-daily tacrolimus formulation (0. 20 mg/kg) was administered to 50 Japanese renal transplant patients every 24 h. Stepwise multiple linear regression analysis for tacrolimus dosing was performed each week {{to determine the effect}} of patient clinical characteristics. The dose-adjusted trough concentration was approximately 70 % higher for patients with the CYP 3 A 5 * 3 /* 3 than patients with the CYP 3 A 5 * 1 allele before the second pre-transplantation tacrolimus dose (0. 97 (0. 78 – 1. 17) vs. 0. 59 (0. 45 – 0. 87) ng/mL/mg; p < 0. 001). The contribution of genetic factors (CYP 3 A 5 * 1 or * 3) for tacrolimus dosing showed increased variation from Day 14 to Day 28 after transplantation: 7. 2 %, 18. 4 % and 19. 5 % on Days 14, 21 and 28, respectively. The influence of CYP 3 A 5 polymorphisms on the tacrolimus maintenance dosage became evident after Day 14 post-transplantation...|$|R
40|$|UV wavebands in {{sunlight}} are immunomodulatory. About half {{the amount of}} UVA within a minimum erythemal dose of sunlight is systemically immunosuppressive, whereas higher doses protect from UVB immunosuppression in mice. We have earlier shown that these responses to UVA are genetically restricted, as they occur in C 57 BL/ 6 but not in Balb/c mice. We used gene set enrichment analysis of microarray data and real-time reverse transcriptase (RT) -PCR confirmation to determine the molecular mechanisms associated with UVA immunomodulation. We found upregulation of mRNA for the alternative complement pathway. The core-enriched genes complement component 3, properdin, and complement factor B were all activated by the immunosuppressive dose of UVA only in UVA-responsive C 57 BL/ 6 but not in unresponsive BALB/c mice. This therefore matched the <b>genetic</b> restriction and <b>dose</b> responsiveness of UVA immunosuppression. The immune-protective higher UVA dose prevented UVB from downregulating chemokine receptor 7 and IL- 12 B, and decreased IL- 10, supporting the earlier identification of IL- 12 and IL- 10 in high-dose UVA protection from UVB immunosuppression. Our study has identified activation of the alternative complement pathway as a trigger of UVA-induced systemic immunosuppression and suggests that this pathway {{is likely to be}} an important sensor of UVA-induced damage to the skin...|$|R
40|$|DNA damage {{induced by}} {{reactive}} oxygen species is involved in mutagenesis and generation of mutation-related diseases, including cancer. Therefore, study of antigenotoxic potential of antioxidants is of great importance for protection of human health. Vitamin C is well known as a potent antioxidant, but its prooxidative effects have also been reported. In this work, antigenotoxic properties of vitamin C in E. coli K 12, E. coli WP 2 and S. cerevisiae D 7 reversion assays, {{as well as in}} S. cerevisiae comet assay were examined. t-Butyl hydroperoxide (t-BOOH) was used to induce oxidative mutagenesis, and hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2) was used to induce DNA strand breaks in the comet assay. Vitamin C reduced t-BOOH-induced and spontaneous mutagenesis in repair proficient and mismatch repair (MMR) deficient strains of E. coli K 12 respectively, as well as t-BOOH-induced mutagenesis in S. cerevisiae D 7 strain. However, in E. coli K 12 strains that carry plasmid with microsatellite sequences, treatment with vitamin C slightly stimulated microsatellite instability. Vitamin C also showed mutagenic effects in WP 2 oxyR strain, probably due to its prooxidative potential, amplified in the strain deficient in antioxidative defense. In the yeast comet assay, contradictory results were obtained: while low concentration (0. 05 mM) of vitamin C inhibited oxidative damage, higher concentrations (0. 1 – 10 mM) stimulated it. The obtained results indicate that vitamin C can exhibit antigenotoxic or genotoxic effects, depending on the <b>dose,</b> <b>genetic</b> background and other experimental conditions...|$|R
40|$|Technological {{advances}} in molecular biology {{over the past}} 2 decades have offered more complex techniques {{that can be used}} to study the role of specific exogenous agents and host variables that cause ill health. Increasingly, studies in human populations use this new technology, combined with epidemiological methods, to shed light on the understanding of the biological processes associated with development of disease. This approach has many potential applications in occupational and environmental medicine (OEM), and some aspects of the work in this growing field are reviewed. An understanding of biochemistry and genetics at the molecular level, specific knowledge on metabolism and mechanisms of action, and epidemiology have become increasingly important for the OEM practitioner. This is necessary to consider the major question of validation and relevance of these molecular biomarkers. As end users, OEM practitioners should also consider the impact of these advances on their practices. For example, the availability of genetic tests to identify susceptible workers raises issues of ethics, individual privacy, right to work, and the relevance of such tests. Several studies have presented data on the association of environmental measurements and various biomarkers for internal and biologically effective <b>dose,</b> <b>genetic</b> polymorphisms, and early response markers. Given the limitations of individual molecular biomarkers in assessing risk to health, and the multifactorial nature of environmental disease, it is likely that such an approach will increase our understanding of the complex issue of mechanisms of disease and further refine the process of risk assessment...|$|R

40|$|Detailed {{data were}} {{provided}} by the Oxford Survey of Childhood Cancer OSCC on deaths from childhood cancer in Britain after irradiation of the fetus during diagnostic radiology of the mother. In each age group at death, 0 - 5, 6 - 9 and 10 - 15 years, excess cancer deaths decreased suddenly for births in and after 1958. A major factor was concerted action initiated in 1956 to reduce radiation exposure of fetal gonads for fear of <b>genetic</b> hazards. <b>Dose</b> reduction was achieved during 1957 and early 1958 by reducing the rising rate of obstetric radiography and by virtually abandoning pelvimetry as that had been understood. In the 1970 s the rate of X-raying increased again and so did cancer risk but not significantly. Direct evidence that diagnostic X-rays can cause childhood cancer is the similar excess rate per X-ray in twins and singleton births when X-raying rate is 5 - 6 times higher in twins. In the past a dose-response for cancer in OSCC data based on number of films per X-ray examination was taken to be evidence for causation but dose per film varies with kind of X-ray examination. Fixed values for dose per film were mistakenly assumed by UNSCEAR (1972) and used by it and others when deriving risk co-efficients. In updated OSCC data cancer risk is independent of film number. The odds ratio for childhood cancer deaths after X-raying in birth years 1958 - 61 (1. 23 with 95 % confidence intervals CI 1. 04 - 1. 48) and the mean fetal whole body dose from obstetric radiography in 1958 (0. 6 cGy) can each be derived from nationwide surveys in Britain. The corresponding risk coefficient for irradiation in the third trimester for childhood cancer deaths at ages 0 - 15 years = 4 - 5 x 10 (- 4) per cGy fetal whole body dose (95 % CI 0. 8 - 9. 5 x 10 (- 4) per cGy). It {{is the same for}} cancer incidence and mortality. A lower risk in bomb survivors exposed in utero is not incompatible since its CI are wide. There is no dependable evidence that radiosensitivity is greater in early pregnancy. A significantly raised cancer rate after diagnostic X-raying supports the hypothesis that carcinogenesis by ionising radiation has no threshold...|$|R
40|$|For {{the final}} stages in the {{eradication}} of poliovirus type 1 (P 1), the World Health Organization advocates the selective use of monovalent type 1 oral poliovirus vaccine (mOPV 1). To compare the immunogenicity of mOPV 1 with that of trivalent OPV (tOPV) in infants, a study was performed in Egypt in 2005. Newborns were vaccinated with mOPV 1 or tOPV immediately after birth and were challenged with mOPV 1 after 1 month. Vaccination with mOPV 1 at birth resulted in significantly higher seroconversion against P 1 viruses and lower excretion of P 1 viruses than vaccination with tOPV. Intratypic differentiation of the viruses shed by the newborns revealed the presence of remarkably high numbers of antigenically divergent (AD) P 1 isolates, especially in the mOPV 1 study group. The majority of these AD P 1 isolates (71 %) were mOPV 1 challenge derived and were shed by newborns who did not seroconvert to P 1 after the birth <b>dose.</b> <b>Genetic</b> characterization of the viruses revealed that amino acid 60 of the VP 3 region was mutated in all AD P 1 isolates. Isolates with substitution of residue 99 of the VP 1 region had significantly higher numbers of nonsynonymous mutations in the VP 1 region than isolates without this substitution and were preferentially shed in the mOPV 1 study group. The widespread use of mOPV 1 {{has proven to be}} a powerful tool for fighting poliovirus circulation in the remaining areas of endemicity. This study provides another justification for the need to achieve high vaccination coverage in order to prevent the circulation of AD strains. Copyrigh...|$|R
