The classification estabilishes quality goals for the water courses aiming to ensure the main uses. These ones were used like a subsidy for the offer elaboration of the Paracatu <b>hydrographic</b> <b>basin</b> <b>water</b> courses classification. To raise the main uses techiniques were used like remote sensing and Geographic Information System (GIS), that permited to manage the informations in soil uses and covertures and water uses maps. The intense human activity in the basin, but mainly in the basins of the rivers Entre-Ribeiros, Escuro, Santa Catarina, Verde, Prata and Rico are determinatives for the classification definition in accordance with the CONAMA n 0 357.

The aim {{of this paper is}} to describe the use of geoprocessing as a support to diagnose water quality of Rio Macaé <b>hydrographic</b> <b>basin</b> <b>water</b> course, and also to evaluate the soil uses and covertures characteristics and the water usage. The results shows the realtionship betwen physical-chemical parameters and soil use and coverture for each source data. Results also include in terms of one of the many possible water quality indexes, such as WQI (IQA), and in cartograms which exhibit spacialized information of the studied items. The WQI values showed that Rio Macaé water quality can be considered good, in general terms. The main use techinique was Geographic Information System (GIS) for synthesize the produced data and for full comprehension by the Rio Macaé basin decision makers. The results now presented can be considered as the start point in synthesizing necessary information and facilitate decision-making processes required for managfor water courses classification which is the main instrument of water resource management of VIII Hydrographic Region of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

40|$|The authors {{argue that}} {{effective}} use of water resources requires accurate morphometric characteristics of <b>water</b> <b>basins.</b> Accurate parameters are needed to analyze their condition, and to assure their appropriate control and operation. Today multiple <b>water</b> <b>basins</b> need their morphometric characteristics to be adjusted and properly stored. The procedure employed so far is based on plane geometric horizontals depicted onto topographic maps.

40|$|The {{abrasion}} {{processing of}} shores is a pressing problem of large <b>water</b> <b>basins</b> of the Lower Volga region and other Russian regions. About 3 km 2 of shoreland is annually {{lost in the}} zone of the Volgograd <b>water</b> <b>basin</b> {{as a result of}} this process. The existing methods of shores protection are connected with the creation of concrete structures having a high level of erosion resistance. They are extremely expensive and in most cases they are not affordable for rural municipalities suffering from abrasion. The authors offer cheap and environmentally friendly way of protecting the shores of large <b>water</b> <b>basins</b> from abrasion. The method is based on the plantation of a common reed strip on a water basin’s shallow. The biological characteristics of common reed as the main component of shore protection structures are described. The terms and milestones of the work in the conditions of the Volgograd <b>water</b> <b>basin</b> are developed. The main result of applying our methodology is the complete cessation of abrasion processing of the shore at the corresponding piece of land. The authors overview the positive qualities of reed plantations, their biocenotic, barrier and waterproof role in on-shore ecosystems. The application of the described method will allow saving for the national economy dozens of hectares of valuable shore lands annually, in particular, irrigated cropland, settlement lands, infrastructure. In addition to the direct benefits associated with the conservation of land resources, the intensity of adverse processes associated with erosion of shores (<b>water</b> <b>basin</b> muddying, deterioration of sanitary qualities of water) will decrease. Due to the wide geographic spread of common reed described in the present work, the technology of shores stabilization can be applied at almost all lowland <b>water</b> <b>basins</b> of Russia...|$|R
