2500|$|According to Cimino, {{he would}} call Washburn while on the road {{scouting}} for locations and feed him notes on dialogue and story. Upon reviewing Washburn's draft, Cimino said, [...] "I came back, and read it and I just could not believe what I read. It was like {{it was written by}} somebody who was... mentally deranged." [...] Cimino confronted Washburn at the Sunset Marquis in LA about the draft, and Washburn supposedly replied that he couldn't take the pressure and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home.</b> Cimino then fired Washburn. Cimino later claimed to have written the entire screenplay himself. Washburn's response to Cimino's comments were, [...] "It's all nonsense. It's lies. I didn't have a single drink the entire time I was working on the script." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{was born}} Rose August Wenger in Cleveland, Ohio, {{one of five}} girls to Swiss-German parents, Fred and Annie Wegner. [...] Her father had wanted a son, and {{encouraged}} {{her to be a}} tomboy. Helen saw her first Wild West show in Cleveland in the summer of 1909 and answered a Miller Brothers 101 Ranch ad for girl riders in Billboard magazine. They taught her to ride, and she performed in her first 101 Ranch Real Wild West Show in St. Louis in April 1910. [...] Said Helen: [...] "(I) was already practicing picking up a handkerchief from the ground at full gallop. When veteran riders told me I could get kicked in the head, I paid no heed. Such things might happen to others, but could never happen to me, I believed. We barnstormed all over the US and the season ended all too soon. I was sorry when I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> and could hardly wait to open in Boston in the spring of 1911." ...|$|E
2500|$|Faut {{had mixed}} results in 1948, {{because she was}} forced to set aside from her teammates. Recently married, with a baby to care for, she began {{handling}} baseball like a professional job and could not socialize after games. As she recalled in an interview, [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home,</b> take care of my family, cook and clean, and all of those things". Nevertheless, in 1949 she recorded her best career season so far, considered by many historians to be the best individual season for any pitcher in AAGPBL history. Faut posted a 24–8 record with a 1.10 ERA in 34 games, allowing 47 runs (36 earned) on 136 hits and 118 walks, while striking out 120 in 261 innings of work. She led the league in wins and shutouts (12), finished second in innings and third in complete games (20). Only two pitchers gave up fewer earned runs, both of Rockford: Lois Florreich, who finished 22–7 with a 0.67 ERA in 269 innings, and Helen Nicol, who was 13–8 with a 0.98 ERA in 212 innings.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Bourguiba {{settled in}} the bourgeois {{neighborhood}} of Tourbet el Bey, in the medina of Tunis, where his brother M'hamed rented a housing on Korchani Street. Interpreter at the State section, he was often off to work or studying in the Khaldounia, aiming to prepare {{the first half of}} the French baccalaureate. This left Habib with Dhaouia, M'hamed's servant who made Habib her domestic She made him do household chores or buy groceries and took him with her whenever she went visiting families in order to select a suitable wife for M'hamed. At the start of the 1907 school year, his brother enrolled him in the Sadiki elementary school. The superintendent described him as turbulent but studious. The young Habib had to perfect Quran learnings, that being the main lessons taught. That made him spend weekends studying and learning Quran with his brother Mahmoud, shouting and screaming being Mahmoud's teaching method. [...] "To go to school", he recalled, [...] "I had to go by foot. Leaving the house where I lived and which belonged to the grandfather of Tahar Lakhdar, I crossed the souks and climbed the hill of Sidi Ben Arous. I was poorly dressed. My shoes had holes which filled with water. By pride, I refused to ask my older brother to buy me a new pair. That was my life throughout my primary education". The Husainid family members being the only ones allowed to take lunch inside the school, Bourguiba <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>home</b> and eat Dhaouia's ratatouilles that did not put an end to his hunger. It was only during the 1911 epidemic of Cholera which killed M'hamed's wife, that he was able to eat his fill, thanks to the Couscous destined for guests, narrowly avoiding starvation.|$|E
