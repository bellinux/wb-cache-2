40|$|Railway-induced ground {{vibrations}} {{may cause}} noticeable movements of nearby buildings {{that result in}} damage or disamenity, both directly and by generating structure-borne noise. Both effects depend strongly on the spectra of railway-induced ground vibrations that, in turn, {{are determined by the}} contributions of differenl excitation mechanisms and by soil properties. Spectra of railway-induced ground vibrations, including train-speed dependent components, have been studied experimentally, and qualitative analysis of the quasi-static excitation mechanism has been attempted. However, no rigorous theoretical investigations of railway generated ground vibrations have been carried out and no quantitatively calculated spectra exist in the literature. In this paper we consider theoretically the effect of quasi-static pressure of wheel axles onto the track-soil system. In the case of welded rails and perfect wheels, this mechanism is the major contributor to trainspeed-dependent components of the low-frequency vibration spectra (up to 50 Hz), including the so called passage frequency fp = v/d, where v is train speed and d is <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>sleepers...</b>|$|E
40|$|This {{article was}} {{accepted}} for publication in the journal, Acustica, and the definitive version is available from: [URL] in speeds of railway trains is usually accompanied by higher levels of generated ground vibrations, which are especially large if train speeds exceed the velocities of Rayleigh surface waves in the ground. Therefore, it is vitally important to consider possible methods of protecting the built environment against intensive ground vibrations associated with high-speed trains. The present paper investigates the effects of some geometrical and physical properties of the track, i. e., those of track bending waves and <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> <b>sleepers,</b> on railway-generated ground vibrations. It is shown {{that the effect of}} track bending waves may cause increase in amplitudes of ground vibrations generated by trains travelling at speeds higher than the velocities of Rayleigh surface waves in the ground (trans-Rayleigh trains) it the train speeds approach the minimal phase velocity of track bending waves. This implies that tracks with low minimal phase velocities of bending waves should be avoided. The reduction of a sleeper period results in decrease of generated ground vibrations for trains travelling at speeds below the velocities of Rayleigh surface waves in the ground (sub-Rayleigh trains). This effect can be used for reduction of generated ground vibrations in selected parts of the rail route. For trans-Rayleigh trains, the reduction of a sleeper period does not affect the vibration levels. Theoretical results are illustrated by numerically calculated frequency spectra of ground vibrations generated by single axle loads travelling at different speeds and by TGV, Eurostar and British high-speed trains...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The axial {{buckling}} {{threshold force}} of {{continuous welded rail}} (CWR) depends on lateral stability of railway track. The conventional CWR buckling models are based on track static parameters and behavior. In this paper, a dynamic finite element model for investigating {{the relationship between the}} rail nature frequencies and the critical buckling axial force of CWR track is presented. This model consists of rails, sleepers and foundation, and covers factors of interest such as track curvature, supporting <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> adjoining <b>sleepers.</b> With the new dynamic model, numerical computations and analyses are performed. The correlations among the critical axial force of rail, the lateral stability and the nature frequencies of CWR track are studied. The computational results of the new dynamic model show a great agreement with the field testing results...|$|R

40|$|The {{introductory}} part of {{the thesis}} describes the development of bridges {{and the emergence of}} steel bridges in Slovenia. It discusses the proportion of steel bridges in Slovenia, their type of construction, static system and type of intersection. The second {{part of the}} thesis discusses the requirements given in the rules on the substructure of bridging structures and provides a detailed overview of individual elements (track, clear profile, ground plan geometry, <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> track centres, <b>sleepers,</b> jointed track, switch, insulation joint, load testing, signs on constructions). As for the third part, it contains a summary of Eurocode 3, the process of designing a steel construction as well as loads and load cases. It also points to the significance of structural details for the construction's life span. Moreover, it touches on the issues of steel bridges – corrosion, descriptions and types of corrosion, preparation of steel surfaces for anti-corrosion protection, and approaches to tackling corrosion. The majority of steel railway bridges in Slovenia are over 80 years old and in a very bad condition in terms of the level of corrosion. The situation is a result of infrequent maintenance of the anti-corrosion protection and even neglect of this aspect of maintenance. To this end, the final part of the thesis discusses how corrosion causes fatigue and decreases pylon thickness, and outlines the methods for determining the loss of material due to corrosion. Considering the fact {{that the majority of the}} bridges have already exceeded their envisaged life span and that their maintenance was rather poor, it is clear that they are worn out and in need of thorough renovation...|$|R

To simulate the relative debonding, slipping and crushing at the contact area <b>between</b> <b>sleepers</b> and ballast, a modified Mohr-Coulomb criterion was adopted. Further more an attempt was made to consider the elasto plastic materials’ non-linearity of the railway track supporting media by employing different constitutive models to represent steel, concrete and other supporting materials. It is seen that during an incremental-iterative mode of load application, the yielding initially started {{from the edge of the}} sleepers and then flowed vertically downwards and spread towards the centre of the railway supporting system...|$|R
