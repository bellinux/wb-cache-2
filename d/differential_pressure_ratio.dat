40|$|The {{velocity}} slip of a fluid at a wall {{is one of}} {{the most}} typical phenomena in microscale gas flows. This paper presents a flow analysis considering the velocity slip in a capacitive micro gas flow sensor based on pressure difference measurements along a microchannel. The tangential momentum accommodation coefficient (TMAC) measurements of a particular channel wall in planar microchannels will be presented while the previous micro gas flow studies have been based on the same TMACs on both walls. The sensors consist of a pair of capacitive pressure sensors, inlet/outlet and a microchannel. The main microchannel is 128. 0 mu m wide, 4. 64 mu m deep and 5680 mu m long, and operated under nearly atmospheric conditions where the outlet Knudsen number is 0. 0137. The sensor was fabricated using silicon wet etching, ultrasonic drilling, deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) and anodic bonding. The capacitance change of the sensor and the mass flow rate of nitrogen were measured as the inlet-to-outlet <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> was varied from 1. 00 to 1. 24. The measured maximum mass flow rate was 3. 86 x 10 (- 10) kg s(- 1) (0. 019 sccm) at the highest <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> tested. As the pressure difference increased, both the capacitance of the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor and the flow rate through the main microchannel increased. The laminar friction constant f. Re, an important consideration in sensor design, varied from the incompressible no-slip case and the mass sensitivity and resolution of this sensor were discussed.

40|$|AbstractSemi-closed oxyfuel-combustion {{combined}} cycle plants are one possibility to realise CCS technologies with natural gas-fired power plants. Due to the recirculation of exhaust gas the working fluid {{in the gas}} turbine consists mainly of CO 2. This leads to the necessity for an increased <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> to achieve the efficiency and the exhaust gas temperatures of conventional gas turbines. In this work a conventional natural gas-fired {{combined cycle}} plant with a reheat gas turbine modified for oxyfuel operation will be presented. As {{it is assumed that}} the necessary <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> is not realisable with axial compressors two different scenarios are considered. On the one hand the <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> is the same as in the conventional process {{and on the other hand}} the <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> is set to an assumed maximum of 60. The exhaust gas temperature lies significantly above the values of the conventional plant. Generally the higher <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> results in a higher net efficiency of the plant. An unchanged heat recovery process results in a loss of efficiency of at least 9. 3 to 10. 8 %-pts. depending on the <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio.</b> Increasing the steam parameters can achieve a reduction of this loss ranging from 0. 5 %-pts for the high <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> to 1. 0 %-pts for the low <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio.</b> An alternative approach for the heat recovery is the application of an internal recuperator in the gas turbine. When the achievable <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> is far from the optimum value, as in the low <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> case, this approach can lead to significantly lower losses of 9. 1 %-pts. With a higher <b>pressure</b> <b>ratio</b> the effects of the optimisation options are similar...|$|R

40|$|Piezoelectric and {{transient}} <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensors are two {{among the}} most widely employed sensors for vortex flowmeter application. The present study evaluates the performance of these two techniques under fully developed and disturbed flow conditions. Firstly, {{the location of the}} transient <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor is optimized to obtain high amplitude signals and good linearity in Strouhal number. Empirical mode decomposition method in combination with autocorrelation decay is successfully employed at high Reynolds numbers to identify the vortex shedding frequency in presence of hydrodynamic noise. The performance of the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor deteriorates significantly under disturbed flow conditions at low Reynolds number due to the presence of low frequency components. This deterioration in the signal quality limits the lower operating range of the flowmeter with <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor. The output signals of the piezoelectric sensor and <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> sensor under no flow condition are compared to obtain the background noise due to piping vibrations and electrical interferences. These results will help a designer to suggest robust signal processing algorithms for vortex frequency detection. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
30|$|After three {{cycles of}} WAG, {{when there was}} no more oil production, an ASP slug was {{injected}} into the core and then displaced by alternate injection of water and CO 2. There was an increase in <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> during the ASP slug injection which shows a flow resistance related to the formation and propagation of the oil bank in the core due to ASP injection. The increase in <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> is due to the mobilization of residual oil which persisted until oil bank breakthrough. The mobilized oil creates an oil bank in front of the ASP slug. As the oil bank size increases, the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> increases until oil bank breakthrough occurs.

After the second oil bank breakthrough and microemulsion production, the conditions in the core and the <b>differential</b> <b>pressure</b> profile are similar to that in the previous WAG process but slightly higher. This is possibly due to chemical slug effects such as adsorption and wettability changes.|$|R
