5|$|According to Nurkse, {{underdeveloped}} countries lack adequate {{purchasing power}}.

Neither real output nor real investment will rise. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> be noted that a low purchasing power means that domestic demand for commodities is low. Apart from encompassing consumer goods and services, this includes the demand for capital as well.|$|E
