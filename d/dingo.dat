5|$|There are few native natural predators of emus still alive. Early in its species history it {{may have}} faced {{numerous}} terrestrial predators now extinct, including the giant lizard Megalania, the thylacine, and possibly other carnivorous marsupials, which may explain their seemingly well-developed ability to defend themselves from terrestrial predators. The main predator of emus today is the <b>dingo,</b> which was originally introduced by Aboriginals {{thousands of years ago}} from a stock of semi-domesticated wolves. Dingoes try to kill the emu by attacking the head. The emu typically tries to repel the <b>dingo</b> by jumping into the air and kicking or stamping the <b>dingo</b> on its way down. The emu jumps as the <b>dingo</b> barely has the capacity to jump high enough to threaten its neck, so a correctly timed leap to coincide with the dingo's lunge can keep its head and neck out of danger.|$|E
5|$|A similar box set was {{released}} for Region 4 markets in Australia. Entitled the Adult Swim Meat Tray Collection, {{it consists of}} six discs containing {{the first and only}} season of Lucy, the Daughter of the Devil and the entirety of 12 oz.

5|$|In January 2010, Mauboy {{made her}} acting {{debut in the}} film {{adaptation}} of the 1990 Aboriginal musical Bran Nue Dae. The film was directed by Rachel Perkins and also starred Ernie <b>Dingo,</b> Geoffrey Rush, Missy Higgins, and Deborah Mailman. In the film, Mauboy {{played the role of}} Rosie, a local church singer who has a love interest for a school boy named Willie (played by Rocky McKenzie). Her performance in the film earned her a nomination for Female Actress of the Year at the 2010 Deadly Awards. In November 2010, Mauboy made a guest appearance in the final episode of the mini-series , and played the role of a nightclub singer named Gloria Starr.|$|E

50|$|During a {{study on}} Fraser Island <b>dingoes,</b> the {{researchers}} reasoned {{that the presence of}} humans influences the activity of <b>dingoes.</b> The tourism industry on the island encouraged people to approach <b>dingoes</b> without caution, and such encounters were practically expected by the tourists. People lost their caution when dealing with <b>dingoes</b> more and more frequently, and the number of reported interactions increased. The way the <b>dingoes</b> reacted towards humans was dependent on the way humans behaved toward them. <b>Dingoes</b> tended to show aggressive behaviour when humans fled, and tended to be intimidated when humans consciously or aggressively moved towards them. Humans making submissive postures seemed to cause a neutral or submissive reaction of the <b>dingoes.</b> That <b>dingoes</b> showed aggressive behaviour towards humans seemed to be similarly likely during different times of the year. However, adult <b>dingoes</b> might be more dangerous during the breeding season, and female <b>dingoes</b> especially when they raise their pups.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Dingoes</b> {{were once}} common on the island, but are now decreasing. The Fraser Island <b>dingoes</b> are reputedly {{some of the}} last {{remaining}} pure <b>dingoes</b> in Eastern Australia and to prevent cross-breeding, dogs are not allowed on the island. According to DNA-examinations from the year 2004, the <b>dingoes</b> on Fraser Island are [...] "pure". However, skull measurements from the 1990s detected crossbreeds between <b>dingoes</b> and domestic dogs among the population.|$|R
5|$|The {{evolution}} of the wolf occurred over a geologic time scale of 800,000 years, transforming the first Middle Pleistocene wolf specimen that is recognized as being morphologically similar to Canis lupus into today's dog, <b>dingo,</b> and gray wolf. Ecological factors including habitat type, climate, prey specialization and predatory competition will greatly influence the wolf's genetic population structure and cranio-dental plasticity. Wolves went through a population bottleneck 20,000 years before present (YBP), which indicates that many wolf populations had gone extinct {{at a time that}} coincided with the Last Glacial Maximum and the expansion of modern humans worldwide with their technology for capturing large game. The domestic dog is the most widely abundant large carnivore, and a descendant of one of those now-extinct wolf populations.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} the {{estimated}} bite force at the canine teeth of a large sample of living and fossil mammalian predators, when adjusted for the body mass, found that for placental mammals the bite force at the canines (in newtons/kilogram of body weight) was greatest in the dire wolf (163), followed among the modern canids by the four hypercarnivores that often prey on animals larger than themselves: the African hunting dog (142), the gray wolf (136), the dhole (112), and the <b>dingo</b> (108). The bite force at the carnassials showed a similar trend to the canines. A predator's largest prey size is strongly influenced by its biomechanical limits. The morphology of the dire wolf {{was similar to that}} of its living relatives, and assuming that the dire wolf was a social hunter, then its high bite force relative to living canids suggests that it preyed on relatively large animals. The bite force rating of the bone-consuming spotted hyena (117) challenged the common assumption that high bite force in the canines and the carnassials was necessary to consume bone.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{potential}} prey-predator relationship, {{the presence of}} predaceous dingoes {{does not appear to}} heavily influence emu numbers, with other natural conditions just as likely to cause mortality. Wedge-tailed eagles are the only avian predator capable of attacking fully-grown emus, though are perhaps most likely to take small or young specimens. The eagles attack emus by swooping downwards rapidly and at high speed and aiming for the head and neck. In this case, the emu's jumping technique as employed against the <b>dingo</b> is not useful. The birds try to target the emu in open ground so that it cannot hide behind obstacles. Under such circumstances, the emu can only run in a chaotic manner and change directions frequently to try and evade its attacker. Other raptors, monitor lizards, introduced red foxes, feral and domestic dogs, and feral pigs occasionally feed on emu eggs or kill small chicks.|$|E
50|$|Despite the on-field {{disappointment}} of the 2011 season, the <b>Dingos</b> club {{continued to be}} strong off the field. Offseason {{events such as the}} AFL Grand Final Party and <b>Dingos</b> Banquet were huge successes, solidifying the <b>Dingos</b> financial health and almost 20 <b>Dingos</b> players traveled to Veradero, Cuba, for a memorable footy trip. A new offseason training regimen, including intense cardio workouts once a week, was embraced by both returning and new <b>Dingos.</b> And with the strength of the club continuing to rise, it was decided that in 2012 the <b>Dingos</b> would go it alone in Division 2, ending the 2-year partnership with the Toronto Rebels. As well, following a trend in the OAFL, the <b>Dingos</b> would start the first Women's Team in club history.|$|R
5000|$|Sometimes [...] "pure" [...] <b>dingoes</b> are {{important}} for tourism, when {{they are used to}} attract visitors. However, this seems to be common only on Fraser Island, where the <b>dingoes</b> are extensively used as a symbol to enhance the attraction of the island. Tourists are drawn to the experience of personally interacting with <b>dingoes.</b> Pictures of <b>dingoes</b> appear on brochures, many websites and postcards advertising the island. The use of dingo-urine as a repellent against <b>dingoes</b> and wallabies has been considered, but has not yet been economically implemented.|$|R
50|$|Humans and <b>dingoes</b> {{generally}} tend {{to avoid}} each other. In some situations, however, such as on Fraser Island and some {{locations in the}} Northern Territory, close interaction between <b>dingoes</b> and humans, especially feeding <b>dingoes,</b> has led to dangerous habituation and attacks.|$|R
5|$|The Just So Stories each {{tell how}} a {{particular}} animal was modified from an original form {{to its current}} form by the acts of man, or some magical being. For example, the Whale has a tiny throat because he swallowed a mariner, who tied a raft inside to block the whale from swallowing other men. The Camel has a hump {{given to him by}} a djinn as punishment for the camel's refusing to work (the hump allows the camel to work longer between times of eating). The Leopard's spots were painted by an Ethiopian (after the Ethiopian painted himself black). The Kangaroo gets its powerful hind legs, long tail, and hopping gait after being chased all day by a <b>dingo,</b> sent by a minor god responding to the Kangaroo's request to be made different from all other animals.|$|E
5|$|The {{need for}} tanks to equip {{armoured}} units led the War Cabinet {{to approve the}} manufacture of the Sentinel tank in 1940. Some 66 of them were delivered by the time manufacture ceased in July 1943, but none were used in action. Otherwise tanks were sourced from overseas. A quantity of M3 Stuart light tanks were received in September 1941, while the first shipment of British Matilda II tanks arrived in July 1942, and these {{proved to be the}} most suitable type for jungle warfare. A flame-thrower variant was produced and eventually saw action in the Borneo campaign. The most numerous tank used by the Australian Army was the M3 Lee. Several hundred of these equipped the armoured divisions, but unlike the Stuarts and Matildas, they did not see action. An Australian scout car known as the <b>Dingo</b> was produced as an interim measure until adequate supplies of the Canadian Staghound armoured car became available in 1944. The Australian Army also operated some amphibious tractors.|$|E
5|$|Div Cav was {{withdrawn}} on 24 April {{and was sent}} back to a rest area two days later. The regiment moved forward west of Enfidaville on 4 May, moving near the town on 8 May, to exploit a breakthrough by tanks the following day. The breakthrough was forestalled by the First Army drive across Tunisia, and the Axis forces in North Africa surrendered on 13 May. Three days later, the regiment began moving back to Maadi, arriving on 1 June. At Maadi the regiment received replacements, while some personnel who had served with the first three echelons received three-month leaves in New Zealand. On 5 July, new personal weapons were issued and the regiment began training on the rifle and light machine gun ranges. A month later the regiment {{was one of the first}} units equipped with Staghound armoured cars. Five troops in each squadron received T17s and one troop in each was equipped with a Daimler <b>Dingo</b> Scout Car. On 17 September, the regiment moved to Burg el Arab and began embarking for Italy. By 1 November its equipment had arrived and the regiment moved up to Altamura.|$|E
25|$|Dingo-like {{domestic}} {{dogs and}} dingo-hybrids can be generally distinguished from “pure” <b>dingoes</b> because of coat colour, {{since they have}} {{a wider range of}} colours and patterns than <b>dingoes.</b> However, even among “pure” <b>dingoes,</b> there is a wide variation of colours. According to the Australian Museum, a <b>dingo's</b> coat colour is largely determined by the area it inhabits. Generally, the coat colour is ginger with white feet. In the desert, <b>dingoes</b> are more golden yellow while in forested and bush areas they are a darker tan to black. Also reports by early settlers in the Blue Mountains region of NSW described <b>dingoes</b> which had wide variations in coat colours. Additionally the dog-typical form of barking appears among dingo-hybrids.|$|R
25|$|The rate of interbreeding {{increases}} when <b>dingoes</b> come {{to urban}} centres, {{due to the}} prospect of easily accessible food resources. However, since interactions between <b>dingoes</b> and other feral domestic dogs in the bush differ greatly from those in urban places, so too do the rates of hybridisation. It is known that domestic dogs {{get lost in the}} bush time and again. However; it is assumed that the behavioural differences between <b>dingoes</b> and other domestic dogs are big enough to make it difficult for these dogs to be integrated into dingo-society and successfully breed, especially in remote areas. A further spreading of hybrids might hasten the process of interbreeding by reducing behavioural differences. This could partially explain the higher proportion of dingo-hybrids in Southeast Australia. The most likely possibility is that the territorial behaviour of established dingo-packs, which keeps away all foreign dogs (<b>dingoes</b> included) and prevents them from breeding, curbs the rate of interbreeding. <b>Dingoes</b> owned by humans as pets are likely to use their owner’s home as a base from which to roam, or are abandoned when they reach adulthood. The result of this pet trend is that contacts between <b>dingoes</b> and other domestic dogs are increasing; because pet <b>dingoes</b> grow up without learning the social behaviours that curb mating and therefore crossbreeding. Many such hybrids are rejected by owners or stray to the bush where they may breed with “pure” <b>dingoes.</b> In addition it is proven that hybrids can appear when <b>dingoes</b> mate with livestock guardian dogs; interbreeding can even occur with dogs that were acquired by their owners to specifically kill <b>dingoes.</b>|$|R
50|$|For the Division I club, 2010 held {{great success}} as well. Anthony O’Brien {{took over as}} Captain and with coach Mick McFarlane led the club to a strong 3-1 start. The <b>Dingos</b> lost their next 4 games, however, as they {{struggled}} to integrate new players such as Andrew Gaut, Andrew Crawford, Stewart Wilson, Ben Oryall, and Will Pattison, into the <b>Dingos</b> system. However, a close loss {{to one of the}} strongest clubs in the league, the Etobicoke Kangaroos, in Week 6 showed that the <b>Dingos</b> were not far from putting it all together. And with the mid-season addition of new Aussies Shaun McKay and Steve Taylor, the <b>Dingos</b> really began to hit their stride, winning five of their last six games heading into the Finals. An Elimination Finals victory at home over the Gargoyles put to rest any bad memories from the 2009 Finals and showed how well a full-strength, healthy <b>Dingos</b> squad could play. Heading into the Semi Finals against the defending champion Eagles, no one gave the <b>Dingos</b> much of a chance. However, with little pressure, the <b>Dingos</b> played one of their best games in years, shocking the Eagles, knocking them out of the Finals, and ending a multi-year losing streak to one of their oldest rivals. Next up; the Kangaroos in the Preliminary Finals. Once again, the <b>Dingos</b> played with little pressure and pulled off another improbable upset, sending them to their first Grand Final since 2005. However, the run ended a little short as the <b>Dingos</b> lost a close match in the rain to the talented Central Blues.|$|R
5|$|Speaking {{about the}} gameplay, Famitsu was {{slightly}} mixed about some aspects; one critic praised the added tutorial for allowing new players to be eased {{in the series}} gameplay, while another compared the tutorial to a nagging mother and said it and the unseen Tactician representing the player might grate with series fans. Bramwell praised the integration of RPG elements and tactical gameplay, in addition to finding the permanent death of characters a suitable fit for the game's world. <b>Dingo</b> was positive about the level design and controls, but warned that it was quite short and lacking in depth when compared to Final Fantasy Tactics Advance. Massimilla found the gameplay both accessible and challenging {{as she made her}} way through the game, while Nutt was skeptical about the permanent death system and critical of the in-game economy despite generally enjoying the experience. Harris again compared it to Advance Wars, but said that Fire Emblem had enough unique elements to make it its own product, and generally praised the title's accomplishments. Burns, who had experience of earlier Fire Emblem titles, praised the game as a worthy entry in the series and a good entry for the West to experience.|$|E
5|$|In Australia, 2012 {{estimates}} {{indicate that}} there are more than 7.2million red foxes with a range extending throughout most of the continental mainland. The species became established in Australia through successive introductions by settlers in 1830s in the British colonies of Van Diemen's Land (as early as 1833) and the Port Phillip District of New South Wales (as early as 1845) for the purpose of the traditional English sport of fox hunting. A permanent fox population was not established on the island of Tasmania and it is widely held that they were outcompeted by the Tasmanian devil. On the mainland, however, the species was successful as an apex predator. It is generally less common in areas where the <b>dingo</b> is more prevalent, however it has, primarily through its burrowing behaviour, achieved niche differentiation with both the feral dog and the feral cat. As such it {{has become one of the}} continent's most invasive species. The red fox has been implicated in the extinction and decline of several native Australian species, particularly those of the family Potoroidae including the desert rat-kangaroo. The spread of red foxes across the southern part of the continent has coincided with the spread of rabbits in Australia and corresponds with declines in the distribution of several medium-sized ground-dwelling mammals, including brush-tailed bettongs, burrowing bettongs, rufous bettongs, bilbys, numbats, bridled nailtail wallabys and quokkas. Most of these species are now limited to areas (such as islands) where red foxes are absent or rare. Local eradication programs exist, although eradication has proven difficult due to the denning behaviour and nocturnal hunting, so the focus is on management with the introduction of state bounties. According to the Tasmanian government, red foxes were introduced to the previously fox-free island of Tasmania in 1999 or 2000, posing a significant threat to native wildlife including the eastern bettong, and an eradication program conducted by the Tasmanian Department of Primary Industries and Water has been established.|$|E
5|$|Kaleski's {{standard}} {{was adopted by}} breed clubs in Queensland and New South Wales and re-issued as their own, with local changes. His writings from the 1910s give an important insight into {{the early history of}} the breed. However, dog breeder and author Noreen Clark has noted that his opinions are sometimes just that, and he introduces some contradictory assertions in his later writings, as well as some assumptions that are illogical in the light of modern science. Some of these have persisted; for example he saw the red colour form as having more <b>dingo</b> in it than the blue form, and there is a persistent belief that reds are more vicious than blues. The most enduring of Kaleski's myths relate to Dalmatian and Kelpie infusions into the early Cattle Dog breed. These infusions are not referred to in Kaleski's writings until the 1920s and it seems likely that Kaleski sought to explain the Cattle Dog's mottled colouration and tan on legs by similarity to the Dalmatian and Kelpie, respectively. The genetics of coat colour, and the current understanding of hereditary characteristics, make the infusion of Dalmatian to increase the cattle dog's tolerance of horses an extremely unlikely event. There were relatively few motor vehicles in Australia {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, so most dogs of any breed would have been accustomed to horses. The Kelpie breed was developed after the Cattle Dog type was described, so its infusion is unlikely. It is possible that there was some infusion of Bull Terrier but there is no verifiable record of this, and the Cattle Dog has not had the Bull Terrier's instinct to bite and hold, which would have been an undesirable trait. Early in the 1900s there was considerable in-fighting amongst members of the Cattle Dog Club, and a series of arguments about the origin of the breed appeared in newspapers and journals of the time. While many of these arguments were misleading, some irrational, and the majority not supported by historical facts, they continue to be circulated, resulting in a number of theories on the origins of the breed. In recent years, information technology enabling the manipulation of large databases combined with advances in the understanding of canine genetics has allowed a clearer understanding of the development of the breed.|$|E
50|$|Owners of <b>dingoes</b> {{and other}} {{domestic}} dogs are sometimes asked to neuter their pets {{and keep them}} under observation {{to reduce the number}} of stray/feral dogs and prevent interbreeding with <b>dingoes.</b>|$|R

50|$|The black-breasted buttonquail, a restricted-range endemic buttonquail, {{was once}} found in sand-dunes on the peninsula. Its current numbers are now {{assumed to be}} one.

25|$|In 2011, {{researchers}} at the <b>Dingo</b> Discovery and Research Centre in Melbourne, Australia, filmed a <b>dingo</b> manipulating a table and using this to get food.|$|E
25|$|Engineer Les Harris, who had {{conducted}} <b>dingo</b> {{research for}} over a decade, said that, contrary to Cameron's findings, a dingo's carnassial teeth can shear through material as tough as motor vehicle seat belts. He also cited {{an example of a}} captive female <b>dingo</b> removing a bundle of meat from its wrapping paper and leaving the paper intact. Evidence was also presented to the effect that a <b>dingo</b> was strong enough to carry a kangaroo and a report of the removal of a three-year-old girl by a <b>dingo</b> from {{the back seat of a}} tourist's motor vehicle at the camping area just weeks before, an event witnessed by the parents.|$|E
25|$|Other {{commonly}} encountered {{animals in}} this habitat include native honeybees, wallaroos (Macropus robustus), common echidnas (Tachyglossus aculeatus) {{as well as}} other far rarer species such as the koala (Phascolarctos cinereus), the <b>dingo</b> (Canis lupus <b>dingo)</b> or the predatory native marsupial the spotted quoll (Dasyurus maculatus spp. maculatus).|$|E
25|$|As of January 2008, {{the number}} of <b>dingoes</b> on the island was {{estimated}} to be 120 to 150, and sightings have become less common. A University of Queensland researcher, Nick Baker, claims the <b>dingoes</b> on Fraser Island have adopted unusual behaviour. Rather than hunt in small packs, Fraser Island <b>dingoes</b> had developed a tolerance for each other and work together in one big hunting pack. Dingo-proof fences, consisting of metals bars across a concrete pit and a 1.8m high mesh fence were built around nine island settlements in 2008, to keep the <b>dingoes</b> out of the townships.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Dingos</b> {{entered the}} 2009 season with great {{optimism}} after a successful recruiting and off-season training program. Mick McFarlane {{took over as}} player-coach, instilling his own style of gut running and hard-nosed football on the club. And it showed on the field as the <b>Dingos</b> won their first three games {{of the year and}} at one point were 8-2 on the season. Confidence was high as the <b>Dingos</b> once again qualified for the Finals, riding a strong season from their veteran players but integrating a whole new cast of <b>Dingos</b> such as Andy Elleway, Ramsey Blacklock, JV Arnaldo, Steve Lanning, Andrew Bremner, Tom Bell, Joel Davies, Tim Simpson, and Matt Eddy. Despite all of their regular-season success, the <b>Dingos</b> were shocked in the Elimination Finals by the Central Blues.|$|R
50|$|Like all {{domestic}} dogs, <b>dingoes</b> tend towards phonetic communication. However, {{in contrast}} to domestic dogs, <b>dingoes</b> howl and whimper more, and bark less. Eight sound classes with 19 sound types have been identified.|$|R
25|$|Interbreeding {{with other}} {{domestic}} dogs {{is regarded as}} the greatest threat to the survival of the “pure” <b>dingo.</b> Genetic analyses, observations and skull measurements {{over the course of several}} years strongly indicate that in approximately 50 years the “pure” <b>dingo</b> will have disappeared in the wilderness of the continent and that it is no longer possible to preserve them there. The <b>dingo</b> researcher Laurie Corbett considers that, given the current rate of interbreeding, there will be no more “pure” dingoes in the wilderness of Victoria in 20 years. The president of the <b>Dingo</b> Conservation Association Barry Oakman was in an interview in the year 2003 of the opinion that without appropriate measures the “pure” <b>dingo</b> would be extinct in the wild in 30 years, in New South Wales possibly in less than 10 years. According to other statements the “pure” dingoes are either close to extinction or they will be close to it over the course of the next 20 years. It is assumed that, should the process go on unhindered, the increasing number of genes from other domestic dogs will effectively lead to the extinction on the Australian continent of the <b>dingo</b> as a separate subspecies by 2100 and that the dog population will then consist of hybrids and other feral dogs.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} of sediment packages throughout the Northern Carnarvon Basin and Exmouth Plateau varies with location during the Jurassic. By the Pliensbachian, the general beginning {{structure of the}} Northern Carnarvon Basin was formed, creating the Exmouth, Barrow, and Dampier sub-basins along the proximal end of the northwestern Australian margin. Rapid subsidence of the Northern Carnarvon sub-basins ensued the deposition of the <b>Dingo</b> Claystones. These Claystones are thick marine shale deposits separated into two sequence, the Upper and Lower <b>Dingo</b> Claystones. The Lower <b>Dingo</b> sequence cannot {{be found in the}} Exmouth Plateau, because deposition During the Early to Middle Jurassic was restricted to sediments filling in the empty troughs of the Northern Carnarvon sub-basins. As deposition continued through the Middle and Late Jurassic, the troughs of sub-basins filled allowing more of the <b>Dingo</b> sediment overflow into the distal margins of the region. This depositional sequence characterizes the Upper <b>Dingo</b> Claystones, which are found as thick proximal sequences in the Northern Carnarvon sub-basins and thinner distal sequences in the Exmouth Plateau.|$|E
25|$|Since the Chamberlain case, proven {{cases of}} attacks on humans by dingoes have been {{discussed}} in the public domain, in particular <b>dingo</b> attacks on Fraser Island (off the Queensland coast), the last refuge in Australia for isolated pure-bred wild dingoes. In the wake of these attacks, it emerged {{that there had been}} at least 400 documented <b>dingo</b> attacks on Fraser Island. Most were against children, but at least two were on adults. For example, in April 1998, a 13-month-old girl was attacked by a <b>dingo</b> and dragged for about one metre (3ft) from a picnic blanket at the Waddy Point camping area. The child was dropped when her father intervened.|$|E
25|$|Interbreeding of <b>dingoes</b> {{and other}} {{domestic}} dogs {{is not necessarily}} unintended and <b>dingoes</b> {{have been used for}} the breeding of certain dog breeds. These breeding attempts already started in the 19th century. The only attempt to date that was regarded as successful was the breeding of the Australian Cattle Dog. It is possible that the Australian Kelpie is descended from <b>dingoes</b> too; however, that has not been proven.|$|R
50|$|Kangaroo hunts are {{probably}} more successful in open areas than in places with high densities of vegetation, and juvenile kangaroos are killed more often than adults. <b>Dingoes</b> typically hunt large kangaroos by having lead <b>dingoes</b> chase the quarry toward their waiting packmates, which are skilled at cutting corners in chases. In one area of Central Australia, <b>dingoes</b> hunt kangaroos by chasing them toward a wire fence that hindered their escape.|$|R
50|$|According to the Austrian {{behavioral}} {{researcher and}} author Eberhard Trumler, <b>dingoes</b> are very smart and affectionate. To would-be owners, he recommended {{the provision of}} a large escape-proof enclosure and a partner of the opposite sex. During heat, <b>dingoes</b> are harder to manage than other domestic dogs which, combined with their attachment to their owners, can lead to problems, since they want to follow their owners and never miss the opportunity to feed. <b>Dingoes</b> are supposed to find every weak spot of an enclosure or residence, escape {{for a while and}} stray through towns and villages. Their intellectual ability is supposedly connected to an enormous ability to learn and a lightning perception. <b>Dingoes</b> have a reputation for not handling pressure, but this conflicts with their record as working dogs. They are suitable as shepherd dogs, appearing to see a purpose in it (keeping together a familiar group is in their nature) and, even today, some <b>dingoes</b> are employed as shepherd dogs. In addition, <b>dingoes</b> have strong toileting instincts and can easily be housebroken.|$|R
