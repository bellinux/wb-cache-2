2500|$|Animal fats are a {{by-product}} of meat production and cooking. Although {{it would not be}} efficient to raise animals (or catch fish) simply for their fat, use of the by-product adds value to the livestock industry (hogs, cattle, poultry). Today, multi-feedstock biodiesel facilities are producing high quality animal-fat based biodiesel. Currently, a 5-million dollar plant is being built in the USA, with the intent of producing 11.4million litres (3million gallons) biodiesel from some of the estimated 1billion kg (2.2billion pounds) of chicken fat produced annually at the local Tyson poultry plant. Similarly, some small-scale biodiesel factories use waste fish oil as feedstock. [...] An EU-funded project (ENERFISH) suggests that at a Vietnamese plant to produce biodiesel from catfish (basa, also known as pangasius), an output of 13 tons/day of biodiesel can be produced from 81 tons of fish waste (in turn resulting from 130 tons of fish). This project utilises the biodiesel to fuel a CHP unit in the fish processing plant, mainly to power the fish <b>freezing</b> <b>plant.</b>|$|E

40|$|Gender, norm and {{knowledge}} in the fishing industry This article deals with the position of women fishplant workers in Iceland. We focus primarily on women’s work in <b>freezing</b> <b>plants</b> but also consider their position in Icelandic society. In our analysis of women’s position in the fishery we examine such aspects as work norms, definitions of skill, and division of labour. We {{show that there is}} a clear gender division of labor, and jobs are defined as womanly or manly. Women's work is valued less and is not seen as requiring skill but feminine qualities. In the <b>freezing</b> <b>plants</b> women are under more constant pressure during their work than men are and their work has become increasingly monotonous. They combine wage work with housework {{and many of them are}} single mothers who work full time. Having a strong work ethic these women do not complain in spite of hard work and low wages. By examining women's position in the fishery we find that gender inequality is not only maintained by low wage and double day but is an integral part of the work process in the fish plants.

50|$|Widespread {{disregard}} of prescribed net sizes {{and the presence}} of illegal processing plants, which the local governments do not control, have compelled environmental groups to protest. The issue turned into a jurisdiction conflict when Santa Fe tightened the regulations in 2005, forbidding the capture of sábalos under 42 cm long, while Entre Ríos kept the limit looser at 40 cm. On July 13, about 400 fishermen blocked the Rosario access to the Rosario-Victoria Bridge that joins the two provinces. On August 1, after Entre Ríos matched its regulations with those of Santa Fe, 300 fishermen and <b>freezing</b> <b>plant</b> workers from Victoria did the same. They were pressured, according to certain claims, by the threat of unemployment if their plants cannot fill their export quotas.|$|E

The collection was on show at the Alþingishús - the House of Parliament, i.e. in the building itself - from 1885 until the year 1950 when it was transferred to the building of the National Museum of Iceland at Suðurgata. There the collection was formally opened to the public in 1951 and in 1961 a law was passed making the Museum fully independent. In 1987 the collection was moved yet again to a new and the present location at Fríkirkjuvegur 7.

40|$|The {{companies}} that are the main players in this case are the two largest marketing companies in the Icelandic fish industry, the Union of Icelandic Fish Producers Ltd. (UIFP) and the Icelandic <b>Freezing</b> <b>Plant</b> Corporation (IFPC). They were both traditionally co-operative companies owned by producers in the Icelandic fish industry until they were changed to Limited Liability Companies in 1993 and 1997. The markets for Icelandic fish products have changed considerably {{during the past two}} decades. Europe has become the most important market and the Japanese market has increased its share considerably. The long term traditional markets like the US and former Soviet Union have declined for the past decade. It is not merely the changes in market areas that affect the fish industry but also changes within the markets. The Union of Icelandic Fish Producers Ltd. (UIFP) was, until 1999, almost entirely in the business of selling salted and chilled fish, while the Icelandic <b>Freezing</b> <b>Plant</b> Corporation (IFPC) has marketed frozen fish. The years 1997 – 2001 brought significant changes to the export sector in the Icelandic fish industry.

40|$|AbstractIn a time {{of fewer}} {{resources}} and rising energy prices savings of primary energy is an important goal for the food industry. This study analyses the potential of cold thermal energy storage (CTES) applying an indirect carbon dioxide system to reduce the electrical power needed by the <b>freezing</b> <b>plant</b> and to minimize the part load operation of the main compressor unit. Theoretical aspects are explained, a system concept is presented and industrial applications are discussed. As an example from the fish industry, a tunnel freezer is applied as a base case for the modelling, it freezes 30 t fish per day. A cascade process of ammonia and a carbon dioxide (CO 2) cycle is calculated for a 24 hours period. The calculation indicates that up to 30 % less electricity {{is required for the}} equal freezing capacity, when CTES is utilized. CTES is a promising technology and offers new temperature levels (below - 50 °C) {{for a wide range of}} applications. The proposed system offers a way to improve the performance and the efficiency of industrial applications as for example tunnel freezers. The final design and operation of CTES systems applying the natural working fluid CO 2 requires further research in the behavior of solid CO 2...|$|E

40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{released}} from <b>plants</b> after <b>freezing</b> {{at the end}} of the growing season may be a contributor to P in runoff from agricultural landscapes. We evaluated P release from alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) and mixed grass species [mainly quackgrass (Agropyron repens) ] after freezing or drying in laboratory and field studies. Freezing released 18 - 30 % of the total P as dissolved reactive P (DRP) and 11 - 25 % of the total P as soluble P. Drying released more water soluble P than freezing with 30 and 74 % of the total plant P released as DRP and total soluble P respectively. <b>Freezing</b> <b>plants</b> in the laboratory or in-field treatment with the herbicide paraquat (1, 1 ’-dimethyl- 4, 4 ’-bipyridinium ion) greatly increased water-extractable P, with more P extracted from grasses than from alfalfa. Alfalfa grown on soils with excessive P soil test levels released more P after <b>freezing</b> than <b>plants</b> grown on soils with optimum P levels. A strong correlation (R 2 = 0. 97) was found between soluble P released by freezing and total P in alfalfa collected from fields with soil test P levels ranging from 35 to 179 ppm. Runoff from paraquat-treated alfalfa or grass field plots subjected to simulated rainfall contained higher P concentrations than runoff from untreated plants. The effects of natural freezing of alfalfa on P losses in runoff were evaluated by collecting runoff from alfalfa and control plots during the October through May over winter period. Although laboratory and simulated rainfall experiments showed the potential for P losses after <b>plant</b> <b>freezing,</b> alfalfa treatments did not affect P or sediment loads in natural runoff in one year of measurement. Climatic conditions including the timing and extent of <b>plant</b> <b>freezing</b> and drying and of precipitation events after freezing likely influence the potential for P losses in natural runoff...|$|R
