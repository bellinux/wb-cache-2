A choice must, however, be made between two basic treatments of transborder business transactions – the origin and <b>destination</b> <b>principles.</b> The destination-principle approach sidesteps the need to identify arm’s length terms of transborder transactions between related business entities – the transfer-pricing problem. This serious problem remains in the origin-principle approach, which, however, presents fewer challenges of monitoring the flow of goods and services across borders, obviates what I call the “tourism problem” whereby people can reduce their taxes by consuming in a low-tax jurisdiction and, arguably most important, avoids transition effects associated with introduction of the tax and subsequent tax rate changes that occur in the destination approach.

40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} general consumption taxes levied under alternative tax principles. It is shown that different national tax rates imposed under a general <b>destination</b> <b>principle</b> or a general origin principle create no relative price distortions and no redistributional effects in a simple international trade model. Under mixed tax principles, nationally diverging tax rates are no longer neutral, however. Two such cases are studied: in the first setting, the <b>destination</b> <b>principle</b> applies to trade in intermediate goods while final consumer goods are taxed under the origin principle. In a second case (which has been termed a restricted origin principle) trade within an economic union {{is based on the}} origin principle while trade with third countries follows the <b>destination</b> <b>principle.</b> It is argued that the abolition of border controls in the European Community will inevitably lead to either the {{one or the other of}} these mixed principles for taxing international trade...|$|E

First, destination taxation distorts production, and makes producers in low-tax countries better off and producers in high-tax countries worse off. Second, origin taxation distorts consumption, and makes consumers in low-tax countries better off and consumers in high-tax countries worse off.

40|$|Balancing a {{legitimate}} fear that carbon leakage could undermine {{the impact of}} any global climate change agreement is a countervailing fear that leakage could be the excuse for protectionism {{in the guise of}} `border carbon adjustments'. This would be dangerous for the world trading system, risking disputes due to ambiguities in the details of World Trade Organization rules over what types of border measures are potentially and actually admissible. Even with good-quality data, there is considerable potential for judgemental discretion, and hence opportunistic manipulation, in estimating the carbon charges to levy on an imported product. This is true even given agreement on whether to use importer or exporter coefficients. A clear distinction needs to be made between environmental and competitiveness motives for border adjustments. The key argument is that the traditional symmetry, between origin (production) -based taxes and other charges (e. g. due to a cap-and-trade scheme) and those based on the <b>destination</b> (consumption) <b>principle,</b> breaks down in the case of carbon charges.
