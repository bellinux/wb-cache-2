40|$|Ecosystem {{services}} markets represent potential {{revenue streams}} for small- and medium-scale rural agricultural and forest producers, {{many of whom}} have faced significant economic downturns over the past several decades. Demand for ecosystem services (ES) in the form of investments by public agencies, mitigation funds from regulated entities, and voluntary payments from corporations and individuals will require credits predominantly supplied by rural areas. Participation on the supply side entails high transaction costs and financial risks that may, however, discourage many rural landowners from participating in projects that would generate supply credits. The project purpose was to explore rural landowner financing needs for ES projects in the growing marketplace. The Institute for Natural Resources (INR) explored those issues in two phases. Phase <b>I</b> <b>entailed</b> preliminary identification of the range of financial approaches for payments for ecosystem services (PES) projects. That was followed by a December 1, 2009, workshop which brought together financial industry professionals along with non-governmental and government leaders active in developing ecosystem services markets to discuss the challenges and opportunities for financing ES projects. Workshop findings from Phase <b>I,</b> <b>entailing</b> participation by financial experts, helped inform the investigation for Phase II involving rural landowners. Phase II combined multiple approaches including focus groups, case studies and a pilot project evaluation...|$|R

Our model {{is consistent with the}} observation that houses are sometimes sold above, sometimes below, and sometimes at the asking price. We consider two versions of our model. In the 8 ̆ 5 rst version, all sellers have the same reservation value. In the second version, there are two seller types, and type is private information. For both versions, we characterize the equilibrium of the game played by buyers and sellers, and we discuss e ¢ ciency. Our model o¤ers a new way to look at the housing market from a search-theoretic perspective. In addition, we contribute to the directed search literature by considering a model in which the asking price (<b>i)</b> <b>entails</b> only limited commitment and (ii) has the potential to signal seller type...|$|R

40|$|This project {{involves}} {{the implementation of}} a new particulate control technology called a ``Core Separator`` for low emission sources (LES) in Krakow. With several hundred boiler sites in the city burning low grade coal, existing pollution control equipment consists primarily of low efficiency cyclones. Such equipment cannot meet the emission standards of most industrial nations. More importantly, these conditions have been the cause of low ambient air quality in Krakow from suspended particles. The Core Separator can be retrofitted onto these boiler houses to substantially reduce particulate emissions, particularly those consisting of the fraction classified as PM 10. In this project, Core Separator technology will be demonstrated for boiler house applications in the Krakow region. Phase <b>I</b> <b>entailed</b> business planning and infrastructure studies to determine the market for this equipment. In the second phase, the technology is to be demonstrated in several boilers of different capacity and firing various grades of coal. Later, a joint venture company was to be established with capability of manufacturing and supplying this equipment in Krakow and throughout Poland...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{describes}} our {{entry to}} the 2012 QA 4 MRE Main Task (English dataset). The QA 4 MRE task poses a significant challenge as the expression of knowledge in the question and answer (in the document) typically substantially differs. Ultimately, one would need a system that can perform full machine reading – creating an internal model of the document’s meaning – to achieve high performance. Our approach is a preliminary step toward this, based on estimating the likelihood of textual entailment between sentences in the text, and the question Q and each candidate answer A i. We first treat the question Q and each answer A i independently, and find sets of sentences SQ, SA that each plausibly entail (the target of) Q {{or one of the}} A i respectively. We then search for the closest (in the document) pair of sentences in these sets, and conclude that the answer A <b>i</b> <b>entailed</b> by SAi in the closest pair is the answer. This approach assumes coherent discourse, i. e., that sentences close together are usually “talking about the same thing”, and thus conveying a single idea (namely an expression of the Q+A i pair) ...|$|R
40|$|Starting {{out from}} the {{assumption}} that monotonicity plays {{a central role in}} interpretation and inference, we derive a number of predictions about the complexity of processing quantified sentences. A quantifier may be upward <b>entailing</b> (<b>i.</b> e. license inferences from subsets to supersets) or downward <b>entailing</b> (<b>i.</b> e. license inferences from supersets to subsets). Our main predictions are the following: If the monotonicity profiles of two quantifying expressions are the same, they should be equally easy or hard to process, ceteris paribus. Sentences containing both upward and downward entailing quantifiers are more difficult than sentences with upward entailing quantifiers only. Downward-entailing quantifiers built from cardinals, like ‘at most three’, are more difficult than others. Inferences from subsets to supersets are easier than inferences in the opposite direction. We present experimental evidence confirming these predictions. ...|$|R

40|$|Scientific literacy, {{marked by}} the ability and {{willingness}} to engage with scientific information, is supported through a new genre of citizen science—course-based research in association with undergraduate laboratories. A three-phased progressive learning module was developed to enhance student engagement in such contexts while supporting three learning outcomes: I) present an argument based on evidence, II) analyze science and scientists within a social context, and III) experience, reflect upon, and communicate the nature of scientific discovery. Phase <b>I</b> <b>entails</b> guided reading and reflection of citizen science–themed texts. In Phase II, students write, peer-review, and edit position and counterpoint papers inspired by the following prompt, “Nonscientists should do scientific research. ” Phase III involves two creative assignments intended to communicate {{the true nature of}} science. Students work collaboratively to develop public service announcement–like poster campaigns to debunk a common misconception about the nature of science or scientists. Individually, they create a work of art to communicate a specific message about the raw experience of performing scientific research. Suggestions for implementation and modifications are provided. Strengths of the module include the development of transferable skills, temporal distribution of grading demands, minimal in-class time needed for implementation, and the inclusion of artistic projects to support affective learning domains. This citizen science–themed learning module is an excellent complement to laboratory coursework, as it serves to surprise, challenge, and inspire students while promoting disciplinary values...|$|R

40|$|The {{scale of}} the December 2004 Indian Ocean Tsunami {{required}} a huge humanitar-ian relief effort, the participants in which were numerous and varied in nature and resources. Given the diversity and the numbers of participants in relief efforts such as this, there is need for central coordination, which is provided by organisations like MPAT. One of the roles of MPAT is {{to act as a}} broker for Requests-for-Assistance (RFAs), attempting to match requests for services or expertise with the corresponding service-providers and experts. Currently, RFAs are brokered manually by the MPAT personnel, which has several drawbacks. The purpose of this project is to consider ways in which this brokering task may be formalised and (perhaps partially) automated. This aims to improve the brokering process, both by achieving more accurate brokering results and by reducing the amount of time needed for the task to be completed. iii Acknowledgements I would like express my gratitude to my supervisor, Stephen Potter, who helped me realize that Research is as much about answering questions as about questioning answers.

40|$|Persons with {{life-threatening}} illness {{are increasingly}} being cared for and dying at home. Palliative care strives to cater to multiple dimensions such as physical, psychosocial and spiritual or existential, and meeting these needs in patients and families requires multiple competencies. Palliative care organizations propose organization and delivery of care in teamwork models; however, teamwork is complex and can be approached from various perspectives. Previous research has identified gaps in palliative care regarding which components of teamwork are most effective. The overall aim of this thesis was to explore perspectives of team function in specialized palliative care teams, among health care professionals, families and patients. Study <b>I</b> <b>entailed</b> translation and cultural adaptation of a research questionnaire. Study II entailed qualitative interviews with health care professionals (n= 15) working in specialized palliative home care and Study III interviews with patients (n= 6) and family members (n= 7). In Study IV, an exploratory design was used. Initially team leaders (n= 77) in palliative care reported team function. Next, health care professionals (n= 61) reported team development in the group development questionnaire, patients (n= 43) reported symptoms in the Edmonton Symptom Assessment System and family members (n= 45) reported satisfaction with care in the translated and culturally adapted FAMCARE- 2 questionnaire. Results of the studies are: (I) a translated culturally adapted and initially tested Swedish language version of the FAMCARE- 2 scale, (II) health care professionals report that competence, communication and organization are crucial components of teamwork in specialized palliative homecare, (III) patients and families report that they experience security and continuity of care due to 24 / 7 care, sensitivity to changing needs and demonstrating caring, and (IV) specialized palliative home care teams have a core of registered nurses, physicians and social workers.

40|$|AbstractRestoration {{efforts in}} the Mediterranean Basin have been {{changing}} from a silvicultural to an ecological restoration approach. Yet, {{to what extent the}} projects are guided by ecological restoration principles remains largely unknown. To analyse this issue, we built an on-line survey addressed to restoration practitioners. We analysed 36 restoration projects, mostly from drylands (86 %). The projects used mainly soil from local sources. The need to comply with legislation was more important as a restoration motive for European Union (EU) than for non-EU countries, while public opinion and health had a greater importance in the latter. Non-EU countries relied more on non-native plant species than EU countries, thus deviating from ecological restoration guidelines. Nursery-grown plants used were mostly of local or regional provenance, whilst seeds were mostly of national provenance. Unexpected restoration results (e. g. inadequate biodiversity) were reported for 50 % of the projects and restoration success was never evaluated in 22 %. Long term evaluation (> 6 years) was only performed in 31 % of cases, and based primarily on plant diversity and cover. The use of non-native species and species of exogenous provenances may: <b>i)</b> <b>entail</b> the loss of local genetic and functional trait diversity, critical to cope with drought, particularly under the predicted climate change scenarios, and ii) lead to unexpected competition with native species and/or negatively impact local biotic interactions. Absent or inappropriate monitoring may prevent the understanding of restoration trajectories, precluding adaptive management strategies, often crucial to create functional ecosystems able to provide ecosystem services. The overview of ecological restoration projects in the Mediterranean Basin revealed high variability among practices and highlighted the need for improved scientific assistance and information exchange, greater use of native species of local provenance, and more long-term monitoring and evaluation, including functional and ecosystem services' indicators, to improve and spread the practice of ecological restoration...|$|R

Even mild TBI (mTBI) can result in cognitive impairments that can impact how veterans experience such things as physical symptoms, emotions and behaviors, instrumental activities of daily living, interpersonal interactions, and community reintegration. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop a comprehensive self-management intervention for veterans with mTBI to facilitate their community reintegration upon returning from deployment to combat zones. This study was conducted in two Phases. Phase <b>I</b> <b>entailed</b> collecting qualitative data regarding needs, concerns, strategies used, and advice given by eight veterans with mTBI, guided by a conceptual model derived from Ferrans’ and colleagues’ health-related quality of life model and the TBI literature. Six key categories and predominant themes emerged providing further support for the model (cognitive impairments, physical symptoms, emotions and behaviors, instrumental activities of daily living, interpersonal interactions, and community reintegration). Guided by the conceptual model, a mTBI Veteran Needs and Concerns Checklist and 14 algorithms making up the VETeranS Compensate, Adapt, REintegrate (VETSCARE) intervention were developed. Phase II entailed obtaining review of the mTBI Veteran Needs and Concerns Checklist and the 14 VETSCARE algorithms from six TBI experts. On a scale of 1 to 5, with 5 being strongly agree, expert ratings provided moderate evidence of content validity for the checklist (3. 33), and for the 14 algorithms (problem relevance 3. 92, accuracy 3. 73, feasibility 3. 80, acceptability 3. 84). The average overall expert rating for the VETSCARE intervention was 3. 82. The checklist and the 14 algorithms are being revised based on specific comments provided by the experts.
