5|$|About {{a talent}} for composition... I can say nothing as yet. You have tried your powers too little... Yes, one can study on one's own. Sometimes one needs advice, but one must study... All of us, that is, <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> and Borodin, and Balakirev, and {{especially}} Cui and Mussorgsky, did disdain these things. I consider myself lucky that I bethought myself in time and forced myself to work. As for Balakirev, owing to his insufficient technique he writes little; Borodin, with difficulty; Cui, carelessly; and Mussorgsky, sloppily and often incoherently.|$|E
5|$|Don't {{you think}} that {{directly}} in nature and alone one does better?...I've always been of this mind, and what I do under these conditions has always been better. One is too much taken up with what one sees and hears in Paris, however firm one may be, and what I am painting here has at least the merit of not resembling anyone...because it will be simply the expression of what I shall have felt, <b>I</b> <b>myself,</b> personally.|$|E

25|$|I had to gain {{them some}} time, and I {{could think of}} nothing other than to attack. I had to stop them somehow. I distracted them, and I even managed to shoot one down, but then <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> was hit. My plane took 15 cannon hits, 80 by machine gun. My leg and my arm were injured, {{although}} I didn't feel a thing. I knew I probably wasn't going to make it back.|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} wonder {{in the region}} which is called Ercing. A tomb is located there next to a spring which is called Licat Amr; {{and the name of}} the man who is buried in the tomb was called thus: Amr. He was the son of Arthur the soldier, and Arthur himself killed and buried him in that very place. And men come to measure the grave and find it {{sometimes}} six feet in length, sometimes nine, sometimes twelve, sometimes fifteen. At whatever length you might measure it at one time, a second time you will not find it to have the same length – and <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> have put this to the test.|$|E
25|$|I defend {{absolutely}} Mr Farage's {{right to}} disagree about the policy or {{institutions of the}} Union, but not to personally insult our guests in the European Parliament or the country from which they may come... <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> fought for free speech as the absolute cornerstone of a democratic society. But with freedom comes responsibility– in this case, to respect the dignity of others and of our institutions. I am disappointed by Mr Farage's behaviour, which sits ill with the great parliamentary tradition of his own country. I cannot accept this sort of behaviour in the European Parliament. I invited him to apologise, but he declined to do so. I have therefore– {{as an expression of}} the seriousness of the matter– rescinded his right to ten days' daily allowance as a Member.|$|E

25|$|I {{want to ask}} {{for your}} {{forgiveness}}, {{that many of our}} dreams didn't come true. That what seemed to us to be simple turned out painfully difficult. I ask forgiveness for the fact that I didn't justify some of the hopes of those people who believed that with one stroke, one burst, one sign we could jump from the grey, stagnant, totalitarian past to a bright, rich, civilized future. <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> believed this. One burst was not enough... but I want you to know – I've never said this, today it's important for me to tell you: the pain of every one of you, I feel in myself, in my heart... in saying farewell, I want to say to every one of you: be happy. You deserve happiness. You deserve happiness, and peace.|$|E

500|$|Leontovych had an {{original}} style. Many {{of his works}} have [...] "deft use of imitative counterpoint" [...] and impressionistic harmony. He had a strong desire for his music to arouse the senses, especially sight, saying, [...] "I'm interested in which colors you used for high tones, and which for the low ones. <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> often think about that, to combine sound and color." ...|$|E

The harmonic draft of the Willow score, and most particularly its spiritual side, came from such a cycle, from such mythology and music history that I was taught, and that <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> convey with my own emotions and compositions." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{discussing}} {{the nature of}} time, Blake wrote in his notes: [...] "The Greeks represented Chronos or Time as a very Aged Man; this is Fable, but the Real Vision of Time is in Eternal Youth. I have, however, somewhat accommodated my Figure of Time to the common opinion, as <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> am also infected with it & my Visions also infected, as I see Time Aged, alas, too much so." ...|$|E
500|$|Parkinson {{actively}} sought {{new varieties}} of plants through his contacts abroad and by financing William Boel's plant-hunting expedition to Iberia and North Africa in 16071608. He introduced seven new plants into England {{and was the}} first gardener in England to grow the great double yellow Spanish daffodil (Pseudonarcissus aureus Hispanicus flore pleno or Parkinson's Daffodil, see illustration). ("I thinke none ever had this kind before myselfe nor did <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> ever see it before the year 1618 for it is of mine own raising and flowering first in my own garden".) ...|$|E

500|$|... "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] was sequenced as {{the final}} track on Revolver, which EMI's Parlophone label issued on 5 August 1966. In his design for the LP cover, Klaus Voormann drew {{inspiration}} from the song, recognising the need for artwork that would capture the Beatles' new direction and the avant-garde aspect of the recording. Voormann later said that he found [...] "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] "frightening", adding that it was [...] "so {{far away from the}} early Beatles stuff that even <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> thought, well, the normal kind of Beatles fan won't want to buy this record. But they did." ...|$|E
500|$|On 7 July 2007, Marseille {{president}} Pape Diouf {{announced that}} the club had {{struck a deal with}} Liverpool to sign Cissé permanently, for an estimated fee of €8million. But subsequently, Cissé was linked with a return to the English Premier League with Blackburn Rovers, Wigan Athletic, Tottenham Hotspur, Portsmouth and Bolton Wanderers said to be interested. Manchester City had their approach for Cissé rejected by Marseille boss, who said, [...] "He is wanted, that is for sure, <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> have been approached by Manchester City (about Cissé) but I turned it down categorically". On 26 January 2008, Cissé scored a hat-trick in Marseille's 6–1 win against Caen.|$|E
500|$|In {{the spring}} of 1965, after {{returning}} from the tour of England documented in the film Dont Look Back, Dylan was unhappy with the public's expectations of him, {{as well as the}} direction his career was taking, and seriously considered quitting the music business. In a 1966 Playboy interview, he described his dissatisfaction: [...] "Last spring, I guess I was going to quit singing. I was very drained, and the way things were going, it was a very draggy situation... But 'Like a Rolling Stone' changed it all. I mean it was something that <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> could dig. It's very tiring having other people tell you how much they dig you if you yourself don't dig you." ...|$|E

500|$|Steinitz rated Anderssen {{as one of}} the two {{greatest}} attacking {{players of}} his time: [...] "We all may learn from Morphy and Anderssen how to conduct a king’s-side attack, and perhaps <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> may not have learnt enough." [...] Although Anderssen is regarded {{as a member of the}} [...] "heroic" [...] attacking school, he was not in favor of mindless aggression, for example he said: [...] "Move that one of your pieces, which is in the worst plight, unless you can satisfy yourself that you can derive immediate advantage by an attack", a principle more recently labelled [...] "Makogonov's rule". According to Fine, his approach to development was haphazard and he totally failed to understand why Morphy won.|$|E
500|$|Despite this, when Caracciola socialised {{with the}} upper Nazi echelons {{he did so}} merely as an [...] "accessory", not as an active member, and at no time was he {{a member of the}} Nazi Party. According to his autobiography, he turned down a request from the NSKK in 1942 to {{entertain}} German troops, as he [...] "could not find it in myself to cheer up young men so that they would believe in a victory <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> could not believe in". Caracciola lived in Switzerland from the early 1930s, and despite strict currency controls, his salary was paid in Swiss francs. During the war, he continued to receive a pension from Daimler-Benz, until the firm ceased his payments under pressure from the Nazi party in 1942.|$|E
500|$|For {{the fact}} is as I soon came to realise myself, and then heard from others later, that the Colchians are {{obviously}} Egyptian. When the notion occurred to me, [...] I asked both the Colchians and the Egyptians about it, {{and found that the}} Colchians had better recall of the Egyptians than the Egyptians did of them. Some Egyptians said that they thought the Colchians originated with Sesostris’ army, but <b>I</b> <b>myself</b> guessed their Egyptian origin not only because the Colchians are dark-skinned and curly-haired (which does not count for much by itself, because these features are common in others too) but more importantly because Colchians, Egyptians and Ethiopians are the only peoples in the world who practise circumcision and who have always done so.|$|E
