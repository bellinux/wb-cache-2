5|$|If countershading paints out shadows, the reverse, darkening {{the belly}} and {{lightening}} the back, would maximise contrast by {{adding to the}} natural fall of light. This pattern of animal coloration is found in animals like the skunk and <b>honey</b> <b>badger</b> with strong defences—the offensive stink of the skunk, and the sharp claws, aggressive nature and stink of the <b>honey</b> <b>badger.</b> These animals do not run when under attack, but move slowly, often turning to face the danger, and giving deimatic or threat displays either to startle inexperienced predators, or as an aposematic signal, to warn off experienced ones.|$|E
5|$|Some {{plants are}} thought to employ aposematism to warn herbivores of {{unpalatable}} chemicals or physical defences such as prickled leaves or thorns. Many insects, such as cinnabar moth caterpillars, acquire toxic chemicals from their host plants. Among mammals, skunks and zorillas advertise their foul-smelling chemical defences with sharply contrasting black-and-white patterns on their fur, while the similarly-patterned badger and <b>honey</b> <b>badger</b> advertise their sharp claws, powerful jaws, and aggressive natures. Some brightly coloured birds such as passerines with contrasting patterns may also be aposematic, at least in females; but since male birds are often brightly coloured through sexual selection, and their colouration is not correlated with edibility, {{it is unclear whether}} aposematism is significant.|$|E
5|$|Mammalian coats are colored for {{a variety}} of reasons, the major {{selective}} pressures including camouflage, sexual selection, communication and physiological processes such as temperature regulation. Camouflage is a powerful influence in a large number of mammals, as it helps to conceal individuals from predators or prey. Aposematism, warning off possible predators, is the most likely explanation of the black-and-white pelage of many mammals which are able to defend themselves, such as in the foul-smelling skunk and the powerful and aggressive <b>honey</b> <b>badger.</b> In arctic and subarctic mammals such as the arctic fox (Alopex lagopus), collared lemming (Dicrostonyx groenlandicus), stoat (Mustela erminea), and snowshoe hare (Lepus americanus), seasonal color change between brown in summer and white in winter is driven largely by camouflage. Differences in female and male coat color may indicate nutrition and hormone levels, important in mate selection. Some arboreal mammals, notably primates and marsupials, have shades of violet, green, or blue skin on parts of their bodies, indicating some distinct advantage in their largely arboreal habitat due to convergent evolution. The green coloration of sloths, however, {{is the result of a}} symbiotic relationship with algae. Coat color is sometimes sexually dimorphic, as in many primate species. Coat color may influence the ability to retain heat, depending on how much light is reflected. Mammals with a darker colored coat can absorb more heat from solar radiation, and stay warmer, and some smaller mammals, such as voles, have darker fur in the winter. The white, pigmentless fur of arctic mammals, such as the polar bear, may reflect more solar radiation directly onto the skin.|$|E

50|$|Although mostly solitary, <b>honey</b> <b>badgers</b> may hunt {{together}} in pairs during the May breeding season. Little {{is known of}} the <b>honey</b> <b>badger's</b> breeding habits. Its gestation period is thought to last six months, usually resulting in two cubs, which are born blind. They vocalise through plaintive whines.

25|$|The {{carnivores}} group mainly {{comprises the}} Asiatic lion, sloth bear, Indian leopard, Indian cobra, jungle cat, striped hyena, Golden jackal, Indian and Ruddy mongeese, and <b>honey</b> <b>badger.</b> Desert cats and rusty-spotted cats occur but are rarely seen.|$|E
25|$|Predators of Cape cobras {{include the}} <b>honey</b> <b>badger</b> (ratel). Other {{carnivorous}} mammals such as meerkats {{and a few}} species of mongoose often prey on the Cape cobra and are its main predators; they have a low susceptibility to its venom. Various birds of prey, including secretary birds and snake eagles may also prey on this species, and so do some other species of snakes.|$|E
25|$|In {{central and}} {{southern}} Africa there was formerly no tradition of beekeeping, and the hive was destroyed in order to harvest the honey, pollen and larvae. The bees adapted to the climate of sub-Saharan Africa, including prolonged droughts. Having to defend themselves against aggressive insects such as ants and wasps, as well as voracious animals like the <b>honey</b> <b>badger,</b> African Bees evolved as a race of highly defensive bees unsuitable {{by a number of}} metrics for domestic use.|$|E

50|$|As {{with other}} mustelids of {{relatively}} large size, such as wolverines and <b>badgers,</b> <b>honey</b> <b>badgers</b> {{are notorious for}} their strength, ferocity and toughness. They {{have been known to}} savagely and fearlessly attack almost any kind of animal when escape is impossible, reportedly even repelling much larger predators such as lions. Bee stings, porcupine quills, and animal bites rarely penetrate their skin. If horses, cattle, or Cape buffalos intrude upon a ratel's burrow, it will attack them. They are virtually tireless in combat and can wear out much larger animals in physical confrontations. The aversion of most predators toward hunting <b>honey</b> <b>badgers</b> has led to the suggestion that the countershaded coats of cheetah cubs evolved in imitation of the <b>honey</b> <b>badger's</b> colouration, which warns off predators.|$|R

2500|$|The {{first phase}} of the rescue mission began the evening of April 24, led by Lt Col Robert L. Brenci of the 8th SOS in Talon 64-0565, Dragon 1. [...] The 1st SOS Talons {{successfully}} secured the forward operating location ("Desert One") in the Iranian Desert, but the helicopter portion of the mission ended in disaster. Although the mission was an embarrassing failure costing eight lives, seven helicopters, and an EC-130E aircraft in a ground accident, the MC-130s performed nearly flawlessly. Planning initiatives for a second rescue attempt, under the project name <b>Honey</b> <b>Badger,</b> began two weeks after the failed raid and continued through November. Combat Talon participation in <b>Honey</b> <b>Badger</b> amounted largely to tactics development, but ECM improvements included chaff and flare dispensers and new ALR-69 threat receivers that improved its defensive countermeasures capability well beyond that existing prior to Eagle Claw.|$|E
2500|$|The {{hedgehog}} (Erinaceidae), the mongoose (Herpestidae), the <b>honey</b> <b>badger</b> (Mellivora capensis), the secretarybird (Sagittarius serpentarius), and a {{few other}} birds that feed on snakes are known to be immune to a dose of snake venom. Recently the <b>honey</b> <b>badger</b> and domestic pig was found to have convergently evolved amino acid replacements in their nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, which are known to confer resistance to alpha-neurotoxins in hedgehogs. Whether the pig may be considered immune is still uncertain, though early studies show endogenous resistance in pigs tested against neurotoxins. Though it has been thought that the pig's subcutaneous layer of fat protects it against snake venom, most venoms pass easily through vascular fat layers, making this unlikely to contribute to its ability to resist venoms. The garden dormouse (Eliomys quercinus) has recently been added to the list of animals refractory to viper venom. [...] Some populations of California ground squirrel (Otospermophilus beecheyi) are at least partially immune to rattlesnake venom as adults.|$|E
