5|$|A {{controversy}} over the effects of running blade length arose at the 2012 Paralympic Games, as Brazilian runner Alan Oliveira and USA runner Blake Leeper changed to longer running blades within a <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> 2012 Paralympic Games. This led to marked improvement in their running times. Pistorius complained after the 200m race that the blades provided artificially lengthened running strides, which would be an infringement of the IPC rules, regardless of that the blades were within the allowable height limits for the athletes concerned. His complaint was supported by single-leg runners including Jerome Singleton and Jack Swift, who called for the T43 double blade and T44 single blade classes to be separated in future events, as single blade runners were unable to adjust {{the height of the}} prostheses, and must always match the length of their biological leg with a running blade.|$|E
5|$|Construction {{had begun}} on September 22, 1966, and the {{interchange}} was {{to replace the}} intersection of Pacific Highway and Rosecrans Street. The cost of the interchange was projected to be $10.86 million. The eight-lane freeway was projected to relieve traffic in the Frontier Street area coming from the San Diego Sports Arena. Completion of both the interchange and SR 109 was planned for early 1969. The ramp from south I-5 to Camino del Rio opened in February 1968, with {{the remainder of the}} project to be completed in summer 1969. The entire project was completed in September, with the road scheduled to open in October; just a <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>before,</b> <b>the</b> routing of SR 209 had been determined.

Gatineau was transferred to Northern Ireland in preparation in May for the Invasion of Normandy and was sent to Canada in July to begin a lengthy refit. The ship was only operational for a <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> war ended in May 1945 and she returned to Canada shortly afterwards.

5|$|In 1968, Tongan mission {{president}} John H. Groberg {{declared that}} a 50th Anniversary Golden Jubilee would be held.

5|$|Males {{are sexually}} mature {{by the time}} they are a year old, though {{successful}} mating generally occurs only after four years. Mature males start establishing territories and try to gain access to females. Females can conceive after they are {{a year and a half}} old; oestrus lasts for 24 to 48 hours, and occurs every 12–29 days in non-pregnant females. The annual three-week-long rut (breeding season) begins toward the end of the wet season, typically in May. Gonadal growth and hormone production in males begin a <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> breeding season, resulting in greater aggressiveness and territoriality. The bulbourethral glands are heavier, testosterone levels are nearly twice as high in territorial males as in bachelors, and the neck of a territorial male tends to be thicker than that of a bachelor during the rut. Mating tends to take place between full moons.|$|E

Between 2004 and 2006, {{attempts were made to}} merge the republic with Krasnodar Krai, but the proposal met with strong resistance from the native Adyghe population and was eventually put to rest. The results of a 2011 opinion poll showed that 83% of the population of Adygea and over 90% of the population of Krasnodar Krai regard a potential merger in an unfavorable light.|$|E

5|$|The 1962 {{edition of}} the Roman Missal, {{published}} a <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Second Vatican Council opened, was the last that presented the Mass as standardised in 1570 by Pope Pius V {{at the request of}} the Council of Trent and that is therefore known as the Tridentine Mass. Pope Pius V's Roman Missal was subjected to minor revisions by Pope Clement VIII in 1604, Pope Urban VIII in 1634, Pope Pius X in 1911, Pope Pius XII in 1955, and Pope John XXIII in 1962. Each successive edition was the ordinary form of the Roman Rite Mass until superseded by a later edition. When the 1962 edition was superseded by that of Paul VI, promulgated in 1969, its continued use at first required permission from bishops; but Pope Benedict XVI's 2007 motu proprio Summorum Pontificum allowed free use of it for Mass celebrated without a congregation and authorised parish priests to permit, under certain conditions, its use even at public Masses. Except for the scriptural readings, which Pope Benedict allowed to be proclaimed in the vernacular language, it is celebrated exclusively in liturgical Latin.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1970s, video games existed almost entirely as novelties passed around by programmers and technicians with access to computers, primarily at research institutions and large companies. The history of video games transitioned into a new era early in the decade, however, with the rise of the commercial video game industry. In 1971, Bill Pitts and Hugh Tuck developed a coin-operated computer game, Galaxy Game, at Stanford University using a DEC PDP-11 computer with vector displays. The pair was inspired to make the game by Spacewar; Tuck had remarked in 1966 while playing the game that a coin-operated version of the game would be very successful. Such a device was unfeasible in 1966 due to the cost of computers, but in 1969 DEC released the PDP-11 for US$20,000; while this was still too high for a commercially viable product, as most games in arcades cost around US$1,000 at the time, the pair felt it was low enough to build a prototype to determine interest and optimal per-game pricing. Only prototype units were ever built, though the second prototype was adapted to run up to eight games at once; a <b>few</b> <b>months</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> initial installation at Stanford in November 1971, the pair met with Nolan Bushnell, who informed them of his own game he was making for a much lower price.|$|E
