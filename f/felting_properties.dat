According to the results, <b>felting</b> <b>properties</b> were affected by nano-clay types and pH.

However, the only fault of wool is its felting propensity during home laundering. Although various anti-felting treatments to reduce the <b>felting</b> <b>property</b> have been developed and used industrially, there are still problems such as environmental issues and changes of fabric handle. These issues were studied in this paper. The effect of DCCA, NaOCl and plasma treatments on anti-felting property, fabric handle, yellowing, color intensity and hydrophilicity were especially investigated.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} public {{concerns}} about {{real estate value}} loss in communities {{in the vicinity of}} wind turbines. There are some conflicting results in recent academic and non-academic literatures on the issue of property values in general—yet little has been studied about how residents near turbines view the value of their own properties. Using both face-to-face interviews (n = 26) and community survey results (n = 152) from two adjacent communities, this exploratory mixed-method study contextualizes perceived property value loss. Interview results suggest a potential connection between perceived property value loss and actual property value loss, whereby assumed property degradation from turbines seem to lower both asking and selling prices. This idea is reinforced by regression results which suggest that <b>felt</b> <b>property</b> value loss is predicted by health concerns, visual annoyances and community-based variables.

40|$|Scouring of {{raw wool}} is a {{chemical}} treatment that needs a high amount of detergents, alkalis and water. Effluents produced by this treatment are extremely polluted with chemicals and impurities washed {{out from the}} fibers. It {{is well known that}} the ultrasound washing can remove effectively different substances from the textile surfaces even without surfactants due to the cavitations occurring at certain parameters of the ultrasound field. On the other side water treatments of wool combined with mechanical agitation provoked felting which can impair the quality of wool materials. Felting itself depends not only on the parameters of water treatments but also on the structure of wool cuticle. Partial hydrolysis of the cuticle with some proteases can decrease considerably the wool felting. The aim of this work is to study the possibility of applying the ultrasound at the process of raw wool scouring and the influence of proteases on the <b>felting</b> <b>properties</b> of wool at these conditions. It has been found out that ultrasound environment applied does not impair the specific activity of enzyme auxiliaries used and leads to increasing of their effect on the surface of wool fibers.

In this paper, acid {{protease}} {{treatment was}} studied on anti-felting finishing of wool knitted fabric and the optimal process conditions {{were obtained by}} orthogonal experiment. The technical parameters were hydrogen peroxide concentration 40 mL/L, temperature 45 ℃, time 45 min, pH value 8, concentration of protease 5 % (owf), pH value 5, temperature 40 ℃ and time 35 min. Through this process, the <b>felt</b> resistance <b>property</b> of wool knitted fabric has been improved greatly. Because of low temperature, energy consumption, environmental pollution, this process belongs to environmental protection and energy saving technology. Introdution Because of special superficial structure of wool fiber, wool knitted fabric is apt to felt. This felt performance has great influence on wool fabric handle and dimensional stability. Chlorination process has been widely used in traditional wool anti-felting treatment, but AOX generated in this process destroys the environment severely. With the increase {{of the environmental protection}} consciousness of people, the traditional methods of chlorination adding resin will be restricted in the future. So it is significant to develop and apply environment-friendly anti-felting process. For the past few years, enzyme has been widely used in the textile industry. Protease can be used to catalyzed hydrolyze peptides of wool and silk fiber, and considered the most promising alternative methods of wool chloride-resin anti-felting process [1]. Due to the effect of wool anti-felting is not satisfied by using protease alone, to enhance the reaction between protease and wool and improve wool anti-shrink effect, various oxidation pretreatment and reduction pretreatment are adopted [2]. At present, chlorinated pretreatment adding protease treatment anti-felting process has been used in many domestic factories. Considering of environmental protection, acid protease anti-felting process with hydrogen peroxide pretreatment was discussed in this paper. This process not only improves wool fabrics anti-felting performance but also not pollutes the environment...|$|R

This paper aims to address this absent perspective by drawing on data generated through qualitative research in two neighbourhoods in a Yorkshire city. The paper draws on 49 in-depth interviews with residents, conducted over a period of three years. The findings reveal that, following the completion of modernisation works, residents reported significant improvements in the appearance, functionality and manageability of their properties; they felt more proud of their homes and were more likely to make additional improvements to them. More generally, it was evident that many residents had experienced a step change in the way they <b>felt</b> about their <b>properties</b> and described a transition from ‘house to home’. In conclusion, it is argued that, although the programme has delivered significant improvements in terms of the residential quality of life that residents experience, the overall impact of the programme is being diluted by several factors, most notably the emphasis placed on ‘bricks and mortar’ by the Decent Homes programme...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT A {{technique}} for {{the measurement of}} the uptake rate of proflavin by the single cell in tissue I:ulture has been developed, and the kinetics of the dye transport are {{discussed in terms of}} its physicochemical properties. Some applications of the technique to the study of permeability are given. INTRODU CTION Most of the work that has been carried out on the passage of substances into the cell has been done on red blood cells, marine eggs, amphibian skin, and nerve. There are few data that apply to mammalian tissue cells other than nerve. Moreover quantitative permeability studies in general have been performed either by placing the cell in a hypotonic medium and noting volume changes (and hemolysis rates in red blood cells) or by using radioactive tracers. In the former the unphysiological environment of the cell is a strong disadvantage in that it may itself affect the cell barrier. The latter suffers from the inability to measure the kinetic process in the isolated cell. The following method has been developed in an attempt to obtain data on this kinetic process in human tissue cells avoiding these disadvantages. It is known (1) that the diaminoacridine dyes enter living cells and in lower concentrations appear to be non-toxic. Proflavin, among other members of this group, has the characteristics of fluorescence when excited by wave lengths around 4500 A as well as being intensely concentrated by the cell nucleus. It was <b>felt</b> that these <b>properties</b> might be utilized in the evolution of a photometric means of measuring {{the rate at which the}} dye enters the cell.

Then another group of shanties were established on Robbin's Island. Conomo Point was no longer populated by only by Essex citizens by 1900.Due {{to the construction of}} the railroad in Essex in 1892, Conomo Point was far more accessible to people from close towns. Since the beginning, Conomo Point residents paid real estate taxes on the land they rented as well as personal taxes on their cottages. The town of Essex expected to profit from its land. The rents increased by 25% in 1927 by vote in a town meeting. In 1951, rents were increased another 5%. Then in 1961, rents were raised even higher by 25%. From 1950 to 1970, the town of Essex sought to maximize its rental income {{while at the same time}} avoided increasing rental rates. Because of this there was a rapid growth of the Point. Over these years, the town of Essex approved new lots to be leased for the sake of cottage construction. Since the water supplied to Conomo Point from Essex was rusty due to rusty pipe lines, Conomo residents drilled personal wells. Since year-round living never came up before because the water lines were turned off in October, Conomo Commissioners were nervous with these new well constructions. Therefore, they were cautious in granting permission to Conomo residents to drilling wells. Conomo Point Commissioners knew that if the residents of Conomo Point had fresh water year-round then the issue of year-round living would come up. In response the Board of Health stated that no wells could be made on town-owned land.|$|R

Today “crime rates are down, occupancy rates are up, investment is increasing as confidence improves and cleanliness has returned” (Turner & Townsend, 2005; Pg: 1). The Johannesburg inner city rejuvenation has attracted investors, some of whom have been successful and others not. This research identified the many factors that affect Johannesburg’s inner city residential property values and grouped the identified factors into the categories: “High Level Factors”, “Low Level Factors” and “Individual Factors”. Participants were then identified from three distinct groups: “Successful Investors”, “Unsuccessful Investors” and “Service Providers” to those investors. Participants were asked to rate the significance of each factor and category. The research outcomes were as follows: Successful Investors and Service Providers to the investors had similar views and ranked the Individual Factors as being most significant, followed by Low Level Factors and then High Level Factors.

40|$|In {{relation}} {{to the development of}} IT-products {{it is very important that}} the software supplier is aware not only of the target group but also the field of application. Usability should characterize the whole IT-design process as, in {{relation to}} this context, design includes more than merely those aspects which are visible to and thus can be interpreted by the naked eye. The study examines the specific qualities and properties that substantiate the usability and the demands that a customer rightfully expects from an IT-product. The user and the customer are highlighted in the same context in order to demonstrate that it is through the customer that an IT-product is defined as being useful. Thus, from this perspective, the user and customer can be considered as being the same person. The empirical survey was based on those factors that were considered to constitute usability and each interview was conducted using these usability factors together with the intended IT-product. The survey has been carried out using analysis models in order to enable the assertions to be both validated and tested and to ensure the appropriateness of the model’s system and also the independence of the method. This qualitative study has been carried out using randomly chosen respondents and IT-products and the perceptions of these respondents in relation to what they <b>felt</b> were the <b>properties</b> that represented a usable IT-product have been noted.
