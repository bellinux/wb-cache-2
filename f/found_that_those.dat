5|$|World {{leaders and}} their diplomats have taken note of Twitter's rapid {{expansion}} and have been increasingly utilizing Twitter diplomacy, the use of Twitter to engage with foreign publics and their own citizens. US Ambassador to Russia, Michael A. McFaul has been attributed as a pioneer of international Twitter diplomacy. He used Twitter after becoming ambassador in 2011, posting in English and Russian. On October 24, 2014, Queen Elizabeth II sent her first tweet to mark {{the opening of the}} London Science Museum's Information Age exhibition. A 2013 study by website Twiplomacy found that 153 of the 193 countries represented at the United Nations had established government Twitter accounts. The same study also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> accounts amounted to 505 Twitter handles used by world {{leaders and their}} foreign ministers, with their tweets able to reach a combined audience of over 106 million followers.|$|E
5|$|Studies of {{the ecology}} and {{genetics}} of Paxillus involutus {{indicate that it}} may form a complex of multiple similar-looking species. In a field study near Uppsala, Sweden, conducted from 1981 to 1983, mycologist Nils Fries {{found that there were}} three populations of P.involutus unable to breed with each other. One was found under conifers and mixed woodlands, while the other two were found in parklands, associated with nearby birch trees. He found that the first group tended to produce single isolated fruit bodies which had a thinner stipe and cap which was less inrolled at the margins, while the fruit bodies of the other two populations tended to appear in groups, and have thicker stipes, and caps with more inrolled and sometimes undulating margins. However, there were only general tendencies and he was unable to detect any consistent macroscopic or microscopic features that firmly differentiate them. A molecular study comparing the DNA sequences of specimens of Paxillus involutus collected from various habitats in Bavaria <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> collected from parks and gardens showed a close relationship with the North American species P.vernalis, while those from forests were allied with P.filamentosus. The authors suggested the park populations may have been introduced from North America. A multi-gene analysis of European isolates showed that P.involutus sensu lato (in the loose sense) could be separated into four distinct, genetically isolated lineages corresponding to P.obscurosporus, P.involutus sensu stricto (in the strict sense), P.validus, and a fourth species that has not yet been identified. Changes in host range have occurred frequently and independently among strains within this species complex.|$|E

25|$|In Utah, an August 2009 poll {{carried out}} for the Deseret News and KSL-TV found that 67% of Utahns {{accepted}} the evidence that Obama {{was born in the}} U.S. The poll <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> who do not believe that Obama was born in the United States, or do not know, are predominantly middle-aged, lower-income Republican-leaning individuals without a college education.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the court}} <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> {{previous}} cases did not entirely {{apply to the}} situation at hand, because {{in the case of}} Ross there was no target container that had been observed being placed in the car, but rather probable cause to believe that contraband was located somewhere in the car.

2500|$|A 2000 poll {{conducted}} by the [...] (ФОМ) in Russia <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 28% of <b>those</b> surveyed {{did not believe that}} American astronauts landed on the Moon, and this percentage is roughly equal in all social-demographic groups. In 2009, a poll held by the United Kingdom's Engineering & Technology magazine <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 25% of <b>those</b> surveyed did not believe that men landed on the Moon. Another poll gives that 25% of 18- to 25-year-olds surveyed were unsure that the landings happened.|$|R
50|$|In 1977 {{a sister}} club, Palloseiskat (‘Little Sevens’) was <b>founded,</b> so <b>that</b> <b>those</b> youngsters, {{who did not}} make the first team, could have a chance to play.

The study also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> of <b>those</b> who listened to U2 music, 95% of them accessed at least one track from Songs of Innocence.|$|R
25|$|Nitrate, {{which is}} found mostly in {{drinking}} water from ground sources, is a powerful teratogen. A case-control study in rural Australia that was conducted following frequent reports of prenatal mortality and congenital malformations <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> who drank the nitrate-infected groundwater, as opposed to rain water, ran the risk of giving birth to children with central nervous system disorders, muscoskeletal defects, and cardiac defects.|$|E
25|$|While the {{available}} evidence is weak, tentative results suggest that frequent ejaculation may decrease the risk of prostate cancer. One study, <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> that ejaculated most frequently (over 21 times per month on average) {{were less likely to}} get prostate cancer. However, the ejaculation frequency was not associated with risk of advanced prostate cancer. The results were broadly similar to the findings of a smaller Australian study and an American study.|$|E
25|$|In other cases, like in Argentina, a non-salvationist told Booth {{that there}} were {{thousands}} of British people there who needed salvation. The four officers sent in 1890 <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> British were scattered all over the pampas. But the missionaries started ministry in the Spanish language and the work spread throughout the country – initially following the rail-road development, since the British in charge of building the rail-roads were usually sympathetic to the movement.|$|E
50|$|In August 2014, {{a market}} {{research}} study <b>found</b> <b>that,</b> {{in comparison to}} other travel websites, Skyscanner tended to have more users aged 16-34. The same study <b>found</b> <b>that</b> 64% of <b>those</b> who have used Skyscanner trust the platform.|$|R
25|$|Also in The Daily Telegraph, Rosa Prince {{singled out}} the film's lead character, Judy Hopps, as {{a welcome change}} for Disney {{animated}} feature film heroines, such as the Disney Princess franchise.

60|$|They {{descended to}} the first floor. They <b>found</b> <b>that</b> the space behind the great room was divided {{into a number of}} chambers. All of these, with the {{exception}} of the small one on the sea-face, were necessarily in absolute darkness, and in all were brackets for torches, similar to those in the principal chamber. Bertie counted them, and <b>found</b> <b>that,</b> including <b>those</b> first met with, they numbered one hundred and twenty-three.|$|R
25|$|There {{are also}} other stipulations that exist. Yasuda et al. studied 28 {{monomers}} and <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> containing aromatic groups, silicon, olefinic group or nitrogen (NH, NH2, CN) were readily polymerizable, while those containing oxygen, halides, aliphatic hydrocarbons and cyclic hydrocarbons where decomposed more readily. The latter compounds have more ablation or side reactions present, which inhibit stable polymer formation. It {{is also possible}} to incorporate N2, H2O, and CO into copolymers of styrene.|$|E
25|$|A recent Finnish {{study of}} more than 5,000 {{hospital}} staff <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> who had been bullied had 26% more certified sickness absence than those who were not bullied, when figures were adjusted for base-line measures one year prior to the survey (Kivimaki et al., 2000). According to the researchers these figures are probably an underestimation as many of the targets are likely to have been bullied already at the time the base-line measures were obtained.|$|E
25|$|Gallup {{conducted}} tens {{of thousands}} of hour-long, face-to-face interviews with residents of more than 35 predominantly Muslim countries between 2001 and 2007. It found that more than 90% of respondents condemned the killing of non-combatants on religious and humanitarian grounds. John Esposito, using poll data from Gallup, wrote in 2008 that Muslims and Americans were equally likely to reject violence against civilians. He also <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> Muslims who support violence against civilians are no more religious than Muslims who do not.|$|E

25|$|While {{there is}} not just one {{explanation}} {{for the cause of}} panic disorder, there are certain perspectives researchers use to explain the disorder. The first one is the biological perspective. Past research concluded that there is irregular norepinephrine activity in people who have panic attacks. Current research also supports this perspective as it has been <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> with panic disorder also have a brain circuit that performs improperly. This circuit consists of the amygdala, central gray matter, ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus, and the locus ceruleus.|$|E
25|$|A 2002 study survey, {{showed that}} among nearly 275,000 prisoners {{released}} in 1994, 67.5% were rearrested within 3years, and 51.8% {{were back in}} prison. However, the study {{found no evidence that}} spending more time in prison raises the recidivism rate, and <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> serving the longest time, 61months or more, had a slightly lower re-arrest rate (54.2%) than every other category of prisoners. This is most likely explained by the older average age of those released with the longest sentences, and the study shows a strong negative correlation between recidivism and age upon release.|$|E
25|$|A {{survey of}} 1.1 million {{residents}} in the United States <b>found</b> <b>that</b> <b>those</b> that reported sleeping about 7 hours per night had the lowest rates of mortality, whereas those that slept for fewer than 6 hours or more than 8 hours had higher mortality rates. Getting 8.5 or more hours of sleep per night {{was associated with a}} 15% higher mortality rate. Severe insomnia– sleeping less than 3.5 hours in women and 4.5 hours in men– is associated with a 15% increase in mortality.|$|E
