5000|$|High modulus asphalt concrete, {{sometimes}} referred to by the French-language acronym EMÉ (<b>enrobé</b> à module élevé), uses a very hard bituminous (penetration 10/20), sometimes modified, in proportions close to 6% on {{the weight of the}} aggregates, and a proportion of mineral powder also high, between 8-10%, to create an asphalt concrete layer with a high modulus of elasticity, of the order of 13000 MPa, as well as very high fatigue strengths. HMAC layers are used both in reinforcement operations and in the construction of new reinforcements for medium and heavy traffic. In base layers, they tend to exhibit a greater capacity of absorbing tensions and, in general, better fatigue resistance.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSevere drop in Manila clams {{production}} in French aquacultured fields {{since the end}} of the 1980 's is associated to Brown Ring Disease (BRD). This disease, caused by the bacteria Vibrio tapetis, is characterized by specific symptoms on the inner face of the shell. Diseased animals develop conchiolin deposit to <b>enrobe</b> bacteria and form new calcified layers on the shell. Suppression subtractive hybridization was performed to identify genes differentially expressed during the early interaction of V. tapetis and Ruditapes philippinarum. Results revealed 301 unique genes differentially expressed during V. tapetis challenge. Several candidates involved in immune and biomineralization processes were selected from libraries. Transcriptional expression of selected candidates was determined in hemolymph and mantle tissues and revealed spatial and temporal variations. At 56 days after infection, when clams were in phase of shell repair, transcripts of galectin and ferritin in hemocytes showed higher expression. Ca-like and serpin transcripts were specifically expressed in mantle and could contribute to defense against BRD...|$|E
40|$|In {{anticipation}} of the introduction of high modulus materials in the Swiss standards, a research project {{has been carried out}} for the evaluation of these bituminous mixtures. Three full-size test sections were built in a test hall for ALT named Halle-fosse: Two sections with two different high modulus bituminous mixtures (named EME, abbreviation of the French designation of the mixture: <b>Enrobé</b> à Module Elevé) as base layer, whereas the third section, used as reference, had a standard bituminous material base layer. The three structures were designed to have an equivalent fatigue resistance and were submitted to loading with a traffic simulator. This device, a truck axle, permits to simulate heavy traffic on roads. Strains were measured for different types of loading at different temperatures, in order to assess the response of the structure. Equivalency factors for both types of EME mixtures were established using, as a basis, the French design method. 1...|$|E

40|$|DE 19826160 A UPAB: 20000203 NOVELTY - The metal {{objects to}} be cleaned (40) are placed in a vacuum chamber (10) in which inert gas, preferably argon, {{has set up a}} {{pressure}} of less than 10 Pa whereupon plasma partly or totally enrobing the objects is ignited. Negative potential of minus 500 V is applied to the objects (40) opposite to the ptoential of the plasma so that the inert gas ions accelerated towards the objects necessarily remove the impurities {{from the surface of the}} objects. The argon can be introduced as a splutter gas and the objects have curves of equal radius of a few mm. In a variant, metal objects are placed as bulk charge in a nonconducting rotating container placed in a vacuum chamber of inert gas using negative potential connections and an object holder so placed as to <b>enrobe</b> the objects partly or totally with the plasma etc. The container can both oscillate and shake etc. USE - Metal cleaning. ADVANTAGE - The objects can be cleaned free of soiling not normally removed by plasma treatment by an environmentally acceptable process free from attack by aggressive chemicals...|$|E
40|$|Le Léviathan de Hobbes [1651] a subi de nombreuses attaques, au point qu’il est jugé {{responsable}} de la grande peste de 1665 et de l’incendie de Londres l’année suivante et que le parlement ouvre une procédure contre l’ouvrage. Aussi, lorsqu’en 1666, Thomas Hobbes veut publier la traduction latine de ce livre, il y adjoint trois appendices. La version latine de l’œuvre est généralement jugée plus acceptable que le texte originaire anglais. En étudiant la manière dont Hobbes traite de son matérialisme dans ces appendices, je tente de montrer que les addenda latins ne constituent en aucune manière un retour en arrière du texte, mais que le philosophe <b>enrobe</b> simplement davantage des propos que, par ailleurs, il rend plus radicaux. Hobbes’s Leviathan [1651] {{has been}} critiqued {{so much that}} it was held responsible for the Great Plague of 1665 and the Fire of London during the following year, resulting in the Parliament instituting proceedings against the book. Therefore, when in 1666 Thomas Hobbes wanted to publish a Latin translation of this book, he added three appendices. Generally, the Latin version of the work is considered more acceptable than the English original text. By studying how Hobbes deals with his materialism in these appendices, I try to show that the Latin additions are in no way a reversal of the text, but that the philosopher simply veiled more propositions, {{while at the same time}} making them more radical...|$|E

40|$|<b>Enrobing</b> is {{a process}} that {{involves}} covering a confection or snack with chocolate or chocolate coatings. Traditionally, this process was slow and involved manually dipping the pieces into melted chocolate by hand. As demand for chocolate-coated sweets increased, it became impractical or impossible to employ enough people to dip sweets into melted chocolate to keep up with production demand. <b>Enrobing</b> can be carried out with chocolate or compound coatings (compound coating is a replacement product made from a combination of cocoa, vegetable fat, and sweeteners). An advantage of compound coatings is that they may set faster and no tempering (the process in which chocolate masses are thermally treated to produce a small fraction of homogeneously dispersed, highly stable fat crystals of the correct type and size) is needed 1. Some typical examples of <b>enrobed</b> products are shown in Figure 1 (page 37). They include wafer bars, fondant centres, jellies, nuts, biscuits and ice cream...|$|R

The enrober maintains the coating medium at a controlled constant temperature and pumps the medium into a flow pan. The medium flows from the flow pan in a continuous curtain and bottoming bed that the food items pass through, completely coating them. A wire mesh conveyor belt then transports the coated confection to a cooling area.|$|R
