40|$|To assess {{adverse effects}} of ambient ozone on injury and growth, EDU (ethylenediurea) and non-EDU-treated plants of {{subterranean}} clover (Trifolium subterraneum cv. Geraldton) were exposed to ambient air at four rural sites in the Netherlands. In each of two successive experiments of eight weeks during the 1994 growing season, an intermediate <b>harvest</b> (<b>cutting)</b> was performed after four weeks of exposure. Concentrations of ambient ozone were high in Experiment 1 (June 21 –August 16) and relatively low in Experiment 2 (August 23 –October 18). Subterranean clover displayed characteristic ozone injury at all sites in Experiment 1 and in Experiment 2 until the intermediate harvest (September 20). The proportion of leaves injured in non-EDU-treated plants was higher than that in plants treated with the antioxidant. Both the degree of injury and the protective effect by EDU differed between sites and were {{not related to the}} measured ozone levels. The proposed short-term critical levels for injury development by ozone would not have protected clover against ozone injury in Experiment 2. The site-dependent pattern of injury in non-EDU-treated plants was similar for the various harvests and experiments and a maximal degree of 23 % injury was observed after four weeks of exposure. The protective effect by EDU was related positively to the injury intensity in non-EDU-treated plants, irrespective of site, harvest and experiment. EDU caused variable effects on leaf biomass production under conditions of low ozone in Experiment 2 whereas EDU generally increased leaf biomass when the plants were exposed to the relatively high concentrations in Experiment 1. The EDU-induced increase in leaf biomass production in this experiment did not vary between sites and was on average 5 – 7 %, depending on the harvest. The involvement of elevated concentrations of ambient ozone measured at the four sites in the Netherlands in 1994 in the observed increase of leaf biomass by EDU is discussed...|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1976 Although some of {{the most}} {{difficult}} problems in forest management occur as a result of timber harvest operations, present methodology in harvest planning emphasizes guidelines which rely heavily upon the experience of the individual forest manager for their correct application. This study was undertaken in an effort to develop a comprehensive methodology to assist forest managers in the design of timber <b>harvest</b> <b>cutting</b> units and the assignment of logging equipment: to those units. The objective of the methodology is to maximize the total value of the timber harvested from a planning area, net of variable and fixed harvesting and transportation costs. The methodology thus developed consists of a two-part procedure. The first part considers the specific topographic and timber conditions on the planning area, plus any harvesting restrictions which may have been imposed on portions of the area because of expected environmental problems, This information is combined with the known mechanics of the logging systems under consideration to determine the feasibility and cost of harvesting each parcel of timber from the area. The second part of the methodology consists of a heuristic optimization algorithm which seeks to assign timber parcels to harvesting facilities so that total timber value, net of fixed and variable harvesting and transportation costs, is maximized. The output from this algorithm is a detailed harvest plan which specifies yarding system assignments and the physical layout of cutting units for each yarding system thus assigned. The optimization problem confronted in this study is an application of facilities location theory, but with two unique characteristics which render the conventional mixed integer programming formulation unsuitable for this problem. First, the planning area is visualized as being dichotomized into timber parcels of equal size, each of which is to be assigned to some harvesting facility. Thus, the problem is a fully discrete one, and can be formulated as a 0 - 1 integer programming problem. Second, the problem exhibits a special "cascading fixed charge" structure. Stated simply, this implies that several levels of fixed charges must be incurred for any complete facility installation. Thus, if a specific logging cableway is to be emplaced at a certain landing, then the fixed charge associated with the construction of the landing must already have been incurred, and the fixed charge associated with the installation of some yarding system at the landing must also have been incurred. Unfortunately the 0 - 1 integer programming formulation appropriate for this problem requires many thousands of variables and constraints, even for relatively small planning areas. To overcome the computational difficulties associated with the solution of such large integer programming problems, a heuristic algorithm was developed to find satisfactory, rather than optimal solutions. Applied to a realistic forest planning problem with 5507 variables and 6555 constraints, the algorithm found an initial feasible solution after 93. 3 minutes on a CDC 3300 computer. The run was terminated after a total of 120 minutes, with the value of the final solution being only 0. 09 percent better than that of the initial solution. Although the exact solution could not be verified, computational experience with smaller problems suggests that the initial feasible solution obtained with this algorithm is usually very close to the optimal solution...|$|E
40|$|Crimson Seedless’ (Vitis vinifera L.) is an attractive, late season, red, {{seedless}} cultivar, {{which is}} currently a very popular table grape cultivar. It {{is one of the}} most planted cultivars in South Africa and third in terms of total area of table grape vineyards in production. Mature ‘Crimson Seedless’ grapes are characterized by outstanding eating quality, good flavour, firm and crisp berries. One of the key factors affecting the yield of table grape cultivars is bud fruitfulness. Low fruitfulness can have a significant effect on the yield of table grape cultivars and ‘Crimson Seedless’ is characterized by a fruitfulness problem. Summer pruning, such as the removal of shoots after harvesting grapes, is a cultivation practice widely used by some table grape producers in the Orange River region of South Africa. The first hypothesis of this study stated that the removal of shoots after harvest will increase the transmitted PAR through the canopy, increase carbohydrate reserve levels in canes and improve bud fruitfulness of ‘Crimson Seedless’. A second hypothesis of this study stated that the cut back of all main shoots and shoots developing from spurs to the nearest lateral shoot and the removal of all unproductive shoots after berry set will result in fruitful shoots the following season. The third and final hypothesis of this study stated that the removal of shoots after harvest and berry set will improve the yield and quality of Vitis vinifera cv. ‘Crimson Seedless’. The study was conducted over three seasons (2010 / 11 to 2012 / 13) and aimed at investigating factors, including shoot removal, impacting bud fruitfulness of an 11 -year-old commercial V. vinifera L. cv. ‘Crimson Seedless’ vineyard, grafted on ‘Ramsey’ (Vitis champinii) rootstocks in the Hex River Valley. The treatment design was a complete randomized design and involved five treatments, which included 33 % shoot removal (S 33) and 66 % shoot removal (S 66) after <b>harvest,</b> <b>cutting</b> of all main and lateral shoots developing from spurs to the nearest lateral shoot (LS), removal of all unproductive shoots (RSB) which was compared with the control, in which standard pruning practices were performed. The results obtained in this experiment showed that shoot removal after harvest and after berry set improves PAR transmission into the canopy, but there was no significant impact on bud fruitfulness. In addition, it was found that shoot removal reduced vegetative growth resulting in thinner canes that also led to the improvement in PAR transmission. Furthermore, bunch number per shoot in the LS treated vines was reduced when compared with S 33 treated vines, illustrating that shoot removal at berry set can reduce bunch number per shoot due to defoliation after berry set. The significant decrease in bud burst in the S 33 treatments compared with the control was expected due to less shoots, resulting in a reduction in cane mass during the 2010 / 11 season. The significant effect of LS treatments after berry set on TSS and total red pigments compared with the S 66 treatments and the control, respectively, clearly indicates that shoot removal after berry set improves grape colour. The positive effect of LS treatments on colour was supported by the significant improvement in class 4 bunches, representing an improvement in quality. Although shoot removal did not have a significant effect on the bunch mass per vine of ‘Crimson Seedless’, there was a significant reduction in total bunches for export and mass of the total export bunches in the LS treatments in the 2011 / 12 season. A link between carbohydrate concentration in canes and bud fruitfulness was not found in this study, as S 33 and S 66 treatments did not have a significant effect on carbohydrate content in canes during the 2011 / 12 season. The question therefore arises whether the treatments applied during the growing seasons are worthwhile, because there was no significant impact on bud fruitfulness of Vitis vinifera L. cv. ‘Crimson Seedless’. This study illustrates that growers need to decide whether it is worthwhile to utilize labour for this practice and they must manage grapevines not only for the current seasons crop, but also for the next season and this can be accomplished by maintaining sufficient carbohydrates for fruitfulness and yield from season to season.

Schum. were investigated {{to identify the}} primary morphological variables influencing adventitious root formation. Potted plants were watered as required with one of four balanced nutrient solutions (0, 15, 63 or 125 mg N l– 1). Increasing the nutrient supply to stock plants increased growth rate and rate of adventitious root production of subsequently <b>harvested</b> <b>cuttings,</b> but an optimum nutrient regime was not identified. Rooting percentage increased from 27 % in <b>cuttings</b> <b>harvested</b> from stock plants receiving a low nutrient supply to 64 % for <b>cuttings</b> <b>harvested</b> from stock plants receiving eight {{times the amount of}} nutrients extractable from plants under typical field conditions in West Africa. The ability of a cutting to retain its leaf during propagation and the length of the cutting were the primary measured characteristics associated with rooting and accounted for 43 % of the variance fitted in the model. The length of the new shoot, total leaf area and within-shoot position (node position) were also significantly associated with rooting. After these characteristics were fitted to the model, the genetic origin (clone) was not statistically significant. We conclude that genetic variation in rooting potential is mediated through variations in morphological and physiological traits, rather than through genetic variation in cell differentiation or related aspects of root initiation...|$|R

40|$|Extending {{the season}} of {{production}} and improving the scheduling of ornamental crops are key commercial objectives for nurserymen. In some woody species, {{the period in which}} cuttings can be rooted successfully is transient, thus limiting the opportunities for scheduled production. Optimum rooting often occurs in early- to mid-summer coinciding with periods of active shoot growth. The relationship between this shoot activity and root initiation was investigated in Cotinus coggygria 'Royal Purple'. Shoot growth on stock plants was manipulated by altering the photoperiod or light quality. Results indicated there were seasonal effects on rooting, but the importance of shoot activity varied with <b>harvest</b> time. <b>Cuttings</b> <b>harvested</b> in August had high rooting percentages, irrespective of photoperiod, and despite shoot growth terminating in response to the short-day treatment. In contrast, by September, rooting percentage was highest in cuttings from plants under long-days, which had maintained greatest shoot growth activity. Cotinus shoots grown in vitro under 16 h days showed reduced shoot growth and increased rooting competence compared with shoots grown under 8 h days. Growing stock plants under polythene films, which altered the amount and quality of the incident light, influenced the rooting of <b>cuttings</b> <b>harvested</b> in August, but no consistent relationship with shoot activity was apparent. From a practical viewpoint, maintaining shoot activity late in the season may prolong the period for propagation by cuttings; but, from a scientific viewpoint, processes associated with an active shoot apex do not provide a complete explanation of seasonal variation in rooting...|$|R

Results indicated that chemical composition, biomass yield, and specific methane yield of Pennisetum hybrid were significantly influenced by <b>harvest</b> period and <b>cutting</b> frequency. The contents of total solids, volatile solids, carbon, cellulose, lignin and starch increased with a prolonged harvest period, whereas the nitrogen and {{crude protein content}} decreased.

A maximum dry matter yield of 41. 63 t/ha was achieved when the Pennisetum hybrid was harvested in October. When the cutting frequencies increased from twice to three times per year, the specific methane yields increased as the biomass yield decreased.
