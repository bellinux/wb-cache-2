50|$|Most early medieval Scandinavians were {{probably}} literate in runes, {{and most people}} probably carved messages on pieces of bone and wood. However, {{it was difficult to}} make runestones, and in order to master it one also needed to be a stonemason. During the 11th century, when most runestones were raised, there were a few professional runemasters. The runemaster Halvdan is known by name because he signed the inscription <b>Sö</b> 270 <b>in</b> Tyresta.

He also received an assignment to the Department of Texas, with orders to perform a survey of Texas rivers and harbors. In 1853 he participated in the Pacific Railroad surveys, ordered by Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, to select an appropriate route for the planned transcontinental railroad. McClellan surveyed the western portion of the northern corridor along the 47th and 49th parallels from St. Paul to the Puget Sound. <b>In</b> <b>so</b> doing he demonstrated a tendency for insubordination toward senior political figures. Isaac Stevens, governor of the Washington Territory, became dissatisfied with McClellan's performance in scouting passes across the Cascade Range.
