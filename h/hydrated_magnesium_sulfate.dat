A DFT PW 91 -TZ 2 P level optimization is performed on the various <b>hydrates</b> of <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfate</b> molecules to study their structural properties. The study identifies a wide network of hydrogen bonds which is significantly influencing the chemical structure of the molecules. These hydrogen bonds appear to cause distortions in the hydrated structures and even hindering the coordination of water with magnesium resulting in lower energy isomers. In the case of hexa-hydrated isomers, the hydrogen bond stabilizes a conformation which has only four coordinated water molecules, and is energetically more stable than the conformation with six coordinated water molecules. The sluggish hydration kinetics in <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfate</b> is attributed to the strong hydrogen bond network present in the crystals.

Methodology and Principal Findings: Disabling ion transporters AtMRS 2 - 10 and AtSULTR 1; 2, which are plasma membrane localized in peripheral root cells, is not an effective way to confer tolerance to magnesium sulfate soils. Arabidopsis mrs 2 - 10 and sel 1 - 10 knockout lines do not mitigate the growth inhibiting impacts of high MgSO 4 ? 7 H 2 O concentrations observed with wildtype plants. A global approach was used to identify novel genes with potential to enhance tolerance to high MgSO 4 ? 7 H 2 O (magnesium sulfate) stress. The early Arabidopsis root transcriptome response to elevated concentrations of magnesium sulfate was characterized in Col- 0, and also between Col- 0 and the mutant line cax 1 - 1, which was confirmed to be relatively tolerant of high levels of MgSO 4 ? 7 H 2 O in soil solution.

40|$|Thermal {{energy storage}} {{systems have been}} {{identified}} as a promising solution to reduce energy consumption by reducing the mismatch between heat demand and heat supply. Compared to other thermal energy storage systems, thermochemical storage (TCM) has some main advantages: it has a potential higher energy density and thermal energy can be stored for a long period without substantial heat losses. TCM makes use of a reversible reaction A(s) + B(g) � C(s) + heat to release or store thermal energy, depending on the direction of the reaction. Mostly agent B is steam and A is a salt which is <b>hydrated,</b> for instance <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfate.</b> Energy density and temperature window, in which the reversible reaction is feasible, depend on the salt used. To dehydrate the salt to its original state (and absorbing heat), excess heat, in the form of solar heat, waste heat of an industrial process or heat from a combined heat and power plant (CHP) can be used and thus stored in the TCM. When a heat demand appears, steam is injected in the TCM, which reacts with the salt, resulting in a hydration process and the release of heat.

40|$|Magnesium sulfate salts {{can form}} {{hydrated}} compounds {{with up to}} seven degree of hydration with an energy exchange {{of the order of}} 2. 8 GJ/m 3 [1]. In addition, this salt is abundant in nature and thus this material is a potential candidate for storing energy in seasonal heat storage systems. One of the main issues in using this material for seasonal heat storage system is its slow kinetics and low extent of water take-up under normal atmospheric conditions [2]. In addition, the salt undergoes considerable changes in its crystalline structure during hydration and dehydration, and often they encounter the formation of cracks and pores in the crystal structure [3]. This significantly affects the efficiency of the salt in storing energy and also reusability of the material. A molecular level investigation is necessary to understand the process of hydration and dehydration in detail. Presence of an extensive network of hydrogen bonds in MgSO 4. 7 H 2 O crystal is identified by Allan Zalkin et al [4]. Significant delocalization of hydrogen atoms within the hydrogen bonds are reported in the study. The 7 th water molecule in a hepta-hydrate crystal is captured in the interstitial space within the crystals due to coulombic forces and they are very easily removable. Thus modeling a stable molecule of magnesium sulfate hepta hydrate is difficult. So we undertake the hexa <b>hydrated</b> <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfate</b> to study the equilibrium molecular structure. The hydrogen bonds present in the structure, which stabilizes the molecule, is a focus of attention in this study. In addition, we report Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) [5] charges of Mg and S as a function of degree of hydration in this study. The NBO analysis gives information about electronic occupations in the molecule. In addition, the variation of the natural charges give information about the nature of inters atomic interactions involved in the hydration process of magnesium sulfates. The hydration process is accompanied by a considerable amount of energy exchange with the surroundings. In addition, significant changes in the crystal structure are predicted to happen during hydration. The binding of a water molecule on a slab of magnesium sulfate will resemble the hydration phenomena of a real crystal. Maslyuk et al [6] have performed such an analysis on kieserite structures and found the influence of hydrogen bonds during hydration.

METHODS: This systematic review used several databases to find five relevant articles regarding the use of intravenous <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfate</b> in non-postoperative patients with atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter. The articles’ outcomes were ventricular rate control and return to normal sinus rhythm. Only randomized control trials that were double or single-blinded were used to ensure validity. RESULTS: Both studies that used <b>magnesium</b> <b>sulfate</b> bolus and infusion in conjunction with an antiarrhythmic medication such as a beta blocker, calcium channel blocker, or digoxin, had better ventricular rate control.

Results: In both groups, one CMS but no PPROM was diagnosed < 3 weeks after fetal MMC repair.
