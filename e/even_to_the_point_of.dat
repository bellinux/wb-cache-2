5|$|By then, Exton had in turn {{been elected}} Mayor. Although {{for a while}} he and Brembre worked {{together}} in running London, when his predecessor fell from influence, Exton effectively deserted him, <b>even</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> being partially responsible for Brembre's eventual hanging. Exton's primary policy throughout his two periods as Mayor was probably based on a desire to maintain the city's neutrality between the feuding parties. On the other hand, he appears to have personally profited from the Appellants' period of rule, and it seems that there was some dissatisfaction with him in London, even if he was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by parliament. His later years are as obscure as his youth; known to have married at least twice, he seems to have had no children, and died in 1402 at an unknown age.|$|E
5|$|From Liverpool's {{point of}} view, the {{situation}} was that Shankly had retired and the club had to move on. Shankly did not understand that by turning up for training at Melwood, he was effectively undermining Bob Paisley, who had succeeded him as manager, <b>even</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> actually taking over the training. Tommy Smith recalled that Shankly as manager never ran training and would only speak to Paisley, Fagan and Bennett about {{what needed to be}} done. But, as a visitor at Melwood he began to intervene and Paisley's initial pleasure on seeing him soon turned to polite embarrassment. Eventually, Paisley had to point out to Shankly that he didn't work there any more, that it was now Paisley's team and that he had things which he wanted to do with the team.|$|E
5|$|More {{than twenty}} {{years had passed since}} Dave Guard had left the group, but {{residual}} tension surfaced between Guard and Shane in an article in The Wall Street Journal that appeared in March 1982 following the national broadcast of the taped show. Guard implicitly disparaged Shane's current group, and Shane asserted a distaste for performing again with Guard, who had spent the intervening decades living and performing in Australia, touring sporadically as a soloist, and writing about and teaching music. Despite the unpleasantness, Shane and Guard reconciled to a large degree (<b>even</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> planning a possible reunion tour) prior to Guard's death at age 56 from lymphoma nine years later in March 1991.|$|E

5|$|Sir Daniel Michael Blake Day-Lewis (born 29 April 1957) is an English {{actor who}} holds both British and Irish citizenship. Born {{and raised in}} London, he excelled on stage at the National Youth Theatre, before being {{accepted}} at the Bristol Old Vic Theatre School, which he attended for three years. Despite his traditional training at the Bristol Old Vic, he is considered a method actor, known for his constant devotion to and research of his roles. He would often remain completely in character {{for the duration of}} the shooting schedules of his films, <b>even</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> adversely affecting his health. He is one of the most selective actors in the film industry, having starred in only six films since 1998, with as many as five years between roles. Protective of his private life, he rarely gives interviews and makes very few public appearances.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch were ill-prepared {{to resist}} such an invasion. When Hitler came to power, the Dutch {{had begun to}} re-arm, but more slowly than France or Belgium; only in 1936 did the defence budget start to be {{gradually}} increased. Successive Dutch governments tended to avoid openly identifying Germany as an acute military threat. Partly this {{was caused by a}} wish not to antagonise a vital trade partner, <b>even</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> repressing criticism of Nazi policies; partly it was made inevitable by a policy of strict budgetary limits with which the conservative Dutch governments tried in vain to fight the Great Depression, which hit Dutch society particularly hard. Hendrikus Colijn, prime minister between 1933 and 1939, was personally convinced Germany would not violate Dutch neutrality; senior officers made no effort to mobilise public opinion in favour of improving military defence.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of clan or lineage groups {{were not very}} influential in local society. However, prominent kinship groups could enjoy {{a great deal of}} ad hoc influence, especially if a member served as a government official. Wealthy scholars or officials often shared the same kinship group with poor commoners. Since clan members were expected to defend fellow members (<b>even</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> murder), government authorities constantly struggled to suppress powerful kinship groups. Local lineage groups formed the backbone of rebel forces in the popular uprising against Wang Mang in the early 1st century CE. When central government authority broke down in the late Eastern Han, less-developed areas of the country remained relatively stable due to entrenched kinship groups, while in heavily developed areas (where kinship groups had been effectively broken down by the state) there were many more peasants willing to turn to rebel movements for protection and survival.|$|E

5|$|On 9 March 1566, Mary's secretary, David Rizzio, {{was murdered}} by conspirators loyal to Darnley. Mary escaped from Edinburgh to Dunbar and by 18 March {{returned}} with a formidable force. Knox fled to Kyle in Ayrshire, where he completed the major part of his magnum opus, History of the Reformation in Scotland. When he returned to Edinburgh, he found the Protestant nobles divided {{over what to do}} with Mary. Lord Darnley had been murdered and the Queen almost immediately married the chief suspect, the Earl of Bothwell. The indictment of murder thus upon her, she had been forced to abdicate and was imprisoned in Loch Leven Castle. Lord Moray had become the regent of King James VI. Other old friends of Knox's, Lord Argyll and William Kirkcaldy, stood by Mary. On 29 July 1567, Knox preached James VI's coronation sermon at the church in Stirling. During this period Knox thundered against her in his sermons, <b>even</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> calling for her death. However, Mary's life was spared, and she escaped on 2 May 1568.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the chief}} {{measures}} by which Ranavalona maintained order within her realm was through the traditional practice of trial by the ordeal of tangena. A poison was extracted from the nut of the native tangena (Tanghinia venenifera) shrub and ingested, with the outcome determining innocence or guilt. If nobles or freemen were compelled to undergo the ordeal, the poison was typically administered to the accused only after dog and rooster stand-ins had already died from the poison's effects, while {{among members of the}} slave class (andevo), the ordeal required them to immediately ingest the poison themselves. The accused would be fed the poison along with three pieces of chicken skin: if all three pieces of skin were vomited up then innocence was declared, but death or a failure to regurgitate all three pieces of skin indicated guilt. According to 19th-century Malagasy historian Raombana, {{in the eyes of the}} greater populace, the tangena ordeal was believed to represent a sort of celestial justice in which the public placed their unquestioning faith, <b>even</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> accepting a verdict of guilt in a case of innocence as a just but unknowable divine mystery.|$|E

Though of Turkic origin, Rum Seljuks patronized Persian art, architecture, and literature and used Persian as a language of administration.

25|$|Shakespeare's {{primary source}} for 3 Henry VI was Edward Hall's The Union of the Two Noble and Illustre Families of Lancaster and York (1548).
