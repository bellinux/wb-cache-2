40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{discussion and}} calculation of electrical torques on an <b>electrostatic</b> <b>gyro</b> {{as they relate}} to the gyroscope experiment to test general relativity is presented. Drift rates were computed for some typical state of the art rotors, including higher harmonics in the rotor shape. The effect of orbital averaging of gravity gradient forces, roll averaging of torques, and the effect of spin averaging on the effective shape of the rotor were considered. The electrical torques are reduced sufficiently in a low g environment to permit a measurement of the relativistic drifts predicted by general relativity...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrostatic}} {{analysis of}} a multiple-capacitance 3 -axis drag-free sensor is presented in this paper. The instrument consists of a proof-mass (a dense metallic ball) floating freely inside a spherical cavity enclosed by the sensor plates and the shield. Since the ball and the cavity are not necessarily concentric, the problem in three-dimensional potential theory for electrostatics is solved by the method of boundary perturbations and specifically in terms of spherical harmonics. The capacitance outputs of the instrument and the electrostatic forces acting on the system are derived as non-linear functions of the ball position, ball charge and the sensor plate potentials. The instrument sensitivity and cross-coupling effects are discussed. The analysis may also be useful for <b>electrostatic</b> <b>gyros</b> and suspensions...|$|R
