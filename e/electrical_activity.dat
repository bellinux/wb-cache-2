This {{usually requires}} brief admission {{to a hospital}} with a specialized sleep medicine department where {{a number of different}} measurements are conducted while the subject is asleep; this includes electroencephalography (electronic registration of <b>electrical</b> <b>activity</b> in the brain), electrocardiography (same for <b>electrical</b> <b>activity</b> in the heart), pulse oximetry (measurement of oxygen levels) and often other modalities. Blood tests are also recommended for the identification of hypothyroidism and polycythemia.|$|E

5|$|Information {{about the}} {{structure}} and function {{of the human brain}} comes from a variety of experimental methods, including animals and humans. Information about brain trauma and stroke has provided information about the function of parts of the brain and the effects of brain damage. Neuroimaging is used to visualise the brain and record brain activity. Electrophysiology is used to measure, record and monitor the <b>electrical</b> <b>activity</b> of the cortex. Measurements may be of local field potentials of cortical areas, or of the activity of a single neuron. An electroencephalogram can record the <b>electrical</b> <b>activity</b> of the cortex using electrodes placed non-invasively on the scalp.|$|E
40|$|<b>Electrical</b> and {{mechanical}} <b>activities</b> were recorded from the rectosigmoid of normal subjects using an intraluminal recording tube with {{two sets of}} bipolar electrodes and strain gauges. Four distinct types of <b>electrical</b> <b>activities</b> were recorded. (1) <b>Electrical</b> control <b>activity</b> (ECA). This activity varied in amplitude and frequency over time and the control waves were not phase-locked. The means of dominant frequency components in the lower and higher frequency ranges were 3. 86 +/- 0. 18 SD and 10. 41 +/- 0. 46 SD c/min, respectively. The overall dominant frequency component was mostly in the lower frequency range of 2. 0 - 9. 0 c/min. (2) Discrete <b>electrical</b> response <b>activity</b> (DERA). This activity appeared as short duration bursts (less than 10 s) of response potentials whose repetition rate was in the total colonic <b>electrical</b> control <b>activity</b> frequency range of 2. 0 - 13. 0 c/min. The mean duration of this activity was 2. 24 +/- 1. 30 SD s. (3) Continuous <b>electrical</b> response <b>activity</b> (CERA). This activity appeared as long duration bursts (greater than 10 s) of response potentials which were not related to <b>electrical</b> control <b>activity.</b> Its mean duration was 14. 78 +/- 3. 68 SD s. This activity generally did not propagate. (4) Contractile electrical complex (CEC). This activity appeared as oscillations in the frequency range of 25 - 40 c/min and was also not related to <b>electrical</b> control <b>activity.</b> This activity propagated, sometimes proximally and sometimes distally. Its mean duration was 18. 87 +/- 9. 22 SD s. The latter three types of <b>electrical</b> <b>activities</b> were all associated with different types of contractions. These contractions, however, did not always occlude the lumen. Colonic <b>electrical</b> control <b>activity</b> controls the appearance of discrete <b>electrical</b> response <b>activity</b> in time and space. The mechanism of generation of continuous <b>electrical</b> response <b>activity</b> and contractile <b>electrical</b> complex is not yet known...|$|R

5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} {{are thought}} to relate to abnormal <b>electrical</b> <b>activity.</b> Seizure activity can manifest as absence (of consciousness), focal effects such as limb movement or impediments of speech, or be generalized in nature. Status epilepticus refers to a seizure or series of seizures that have not terminated within 30 minutes, although this definition has recently been revised. Seizures have {{a large number of}} causes, however many seizures occur without a definitive cause being found. In a person with epilepsy, risk factors for further seizures may include sleeplessness, drug and alcohol intake, and stress. Seizures may be assessed using blood tests, EEG and various medical imaging techniques based on the medical history and exam findings. In addition to treating an underlying cause and reducing exposure to risk factors, anticonvulsant medications can play a role in preventing further seizures.|$|E
5|$|Abnormalities in {{the normal}} sinus rhythm of the heart can prevent the heart from {{effectively}} pumping blood, and are generally identified by ECG. These cardiac arrhythmias can cause an abnormal but regular heart rhythm, such as a rapid heart rate (tachycardia, classified as arising from above the ventricles or from the ventricles) or a slow heart rate (bradycardia); or may result in irregular rhythms. Tachycardia is generally defined as a heart rate faster than 100 beats per minute, and bradycardia as a heart rate slower than 60. Asystole is the cessation of heart rhythm. A random and varying rhythm is classified as atrial or ventricular fibrillation depending if the <b>electrical</b> <b>activity</b> originates in the atria or the ventricles. Abnormal conduction can cause a delay or unusual order of contraction of the heart muscle. This can {{be a result of}} a disease process, such as heart block, or congenital, such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.|$|E

40|$|As the {{fluctuations}} of {{the internal}} bioelectricity of nervous system is various and complex, the external electromagnetic radiation induced by magnet flux on membrane can be described by the non-Gaussian type distribution of Lévy noise. Thus, the <b>electrical</b> <b>activities</b> in an improved Hindmarsh-Rose model excited by the external electromagnetic radiation of Lévy noise are investigated and some interesting modes of the <b>electrical</b> <b>activities</b> are exhibited. The external electromagnetic radiation of Lévy noise leads to the mode transition of the <b>electrical</b> <b>activities</b> and spatial phase, such as from the rest state to the firing state, from the spiking state to the spiking state with more spikes, and from the spiking state to the bursting state. Then the time points of the firing state versus Lévy noise intensity are depicted. The increasing of Lévy noise intensity heightens the neuron firing. Also the stationary probability distribution functions of the membrane potential of the neuron induced by the external electromagnetic radiation of Lévy noise with different intensity, stability index and skewness papremeters are analyzed. Moreover, through the positive largest Lyapunov exponent, the parameter regions of chaotic electrical mode of the neuron induced by the external electromagnetic radiation of Lévy noise distribution are detected...|$|R
5|$|As a {{side effect}} of the {{electrochemical}} processes used by neurons for signaling, brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active. When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull, using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). EEG recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active, even during sleep. Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves during sleep, faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task. During an epileptic seizure, the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and <b>electrical</b> <b>activity</b> rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain. Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology.|$|E

40|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>activities</b> are {{ubiquitous}} neuronal bioelectric phenomena, {{which have}} many different modes to encode {{the expression of}} biological information, and constitute {{the whole process of}} signal propagation between neurons. Therefore, we focus on the <b>electrical</b> <b>activities</b> of neurons, which is also causing widespread concern among neuroscientists. In this paper, we mainly investigate the <b>electrical</b> <b>activities</b> of the Morris-Lecar (M-L) model with electromagnetic radiation or Gaussian white noise, which can restore the authenticity of neurons in realistic neural network. First, we explore dynamical response of the whole system with electromagnetic induction (EMI) and Gaussian white noise. We find that there are slight differences in the discharge behaviors via comparing the response of original system with that of improved system, and electromagnetic induction can transform bursting or spiking state to quiescent state and vice versa. Furthermore, we research bursting transition mode and the corresponding periodic solution mechanism for the isolated neuron model with electromagnetic induction by using one-parameter and bi-parameters bifurcation analysis. Finally, we analyze the effects of Gaussian white noise on the original system and coupled system, which is conducive to understand the actual discharge properties of realistic neurons...|$|R
