50|$|Mr Wilson was {{a teacher}} whose school had been {{transferred}} to St Helens BC. He was dismissed for being ‘redundant’. Then he and other teachers were rehired on new contracts with worse terms. They continued working {{for a few months}} before claiming that the reduced wages were in breach of r 5 (now TUPER 2006 r 4). Were the dismissals effective? If not, teachers could claim to be employees under the old terms, whereas if so, they could merely claim unfair dismissal. They wanted to claim unauthorised <b>deductions</b> <b>from</b> <b>pay.</b>|$|E
50|$|One {{stipulation}} of the PAEA {{has caused}} controversy. It stipulates that the USPS {{is to make}} payments of $5.4 - $5.8 billion into the Postal Service Retiree Health Benefits Fund, each year, from 2007 to 2016 in order to prefund 50 years of estimated costs. This requirement also explicitly stated that the USPS was to stop using its savings to reduce postal debt, which was stipulated in Postal Civil Service Retirement System Funding Reform Act of 2003. This is in addition to <b>deductions</b> <b>from</b> <b>pay</b> for federal contribution to social services. This pre-funding method is unique to the USPS. In June 2011, the USPS had to suspend its weekly payment of 115 million into the fund because it had reached 8 billion dollars in debt and the retirement plan had a surplus of 6.9 billion dollars.|$|E

40|$|Migrant workers often {{enter the}} UK {{in the hope}} of finding a better life – the truth is often far from that. Migrant workers are denied social {{benefits}} and are offered very little protection in terms of employment rights while the destitution faced by unemployed migrants makes them more vulnerable to unscrupulous employers. According to our evidence, pay is withheld, holidays refused, unlawful <b>deductions</b> <b>from</b> <b>pay</b> are often demanded and no pay slip provided. Yet migrant workers have no redress because their contract is often deemed ‘unlawful’. Attempts by workers to organise into a union are often thwarted by employers calling in immigration authorities. The intense exploitation faced by migrant workers highlights fundamental weaknesses in British employment law. The best way to address this is to undermine the economic advantage to employers of employing migrant workers. This should be done, not by restricting the supply of such labour but by regulating employment status, practices and protections. By strengthening migrant workers’ rights, we help prevent unscrupulous employers undercutting wages and depressing sectors of the economy. This in turn will help remove some of the hostility shown to migrant workers in sections of society...|$|E
5000|$|Payments {{into the}} Chest were made as {{compulsory}} <b>deductions</b> <b>from</b> the <b>pay</b> of each Royal Navy seaman. From 1594 to 1649, deductions were set at [...] of a seaman's wages, equivalent in 1626 to a sixpence <b>from</b> the monthly <b>pay</b> of fifteen shillings. In 1649 the standard seaman's wage was increased to nineteen shillings and a differential deduction introduced, of sixpence {{a month for}} ordinary seamen, eight pence for surgeons and ten pence for chaplains.|$|R

50|$|The Chatham Chest was a fund {{set up in}} 1588 to pay {{pensions}} to disabled seamen {{from the}} Royal Navy. It was financed by regular <b>deductions</b> <b>from</b> seamen's <b>pay,</b> which were deposited in a chest held at Chatham Dockyard and disbursed upon proof of a sailor's disability. The fund ceased operation in 1803 when it was merged with an equivalent pension scheme run by Greenwich Hospital. The actual Chatham Chest has since been displayed at the National Maritime Museum in London and at The Mast House at Chatham Historic Dockyard.|$|R
50|$|The 'rank-pay' scheme {{apart from}} {{provoking}} contentious litigation, {{was one of}} the causes that fueled protracted protest by veterans over One Rank, One Pension (OROP); and, in the estimate of former chiefs of the armed forces, the degradation of armed forces ranks which rank-pay <b>deductions</b> <b>from</b> basic <b>pay</b> caused, affected armed forces morale and national security, about which they wrote letters to the Prime minister, including Narendra Modi. The legacy of reduction of grade-pay of armed forces lingers, and has variously affected the outcomes of the 5th, 6th and 7th Central Pay Commission.|$|R

Interviews were carried out with the managers at national, district and unit or trust level in the National Health Service. Although there had been major national disputes and industrial action in the 1980 s, local issues were the most likely source of disputes and possible industrial action. The experience of the 1980 s therefore had a continued relevance after the 1990 reforms encouraged extensive devolution of industrial relations issues to unit level. The only notable legal ingredient in management responses to industrial action was <b>deductions</b> <b>from</b> the <b>pay</b> of staff who were not working normally, but on this as on other issues there were notable variations in practice in different areas. In general the law did not seem to be central component in management thinking on how to respond to disputes. ...|$|R
5000|$|All FERS and CSRS {{employees}} {{and members of}} the uniformed services may contribute up to the Internal Revenue Code limitation, which is $18,000 for 2017. The contribution for FERS and CSRS may be either a specific dollar amount per paycheck or a percentage of income (but the percentage must be a whole percentage; fractional percentages are not allowed), uniformed service members elect a percentage of pay only. (Prior to 2006 the contribution was limited to a specified whole percentage of pay.) Once the contribution is selected it automatically renews each year at the same amount or percentage until the participant elects otherwise. As of September 2015, new employees will be enrolled in the TSP with a 3% <b>deduction</b> <b>from</b> their gross <b>pay</b> being deposited into the age-appropriate Lifecycle Fund unless they make another choice.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reports the}} results of {{one part of a}} {{research}} project designed to investigate {{the nature and extent of}} the impact of the labour legislation enacted between 1980 and 1990 on the conduct of industrial relations and the processes by which this has come about. Interviews were carried out with officers in the education departments of ten Local Education Authorities. All had felt the impact of major national disputes from the mid- 1980 s to early 1990 s. The most important legacy of this experience so far as the law was concerned was that it had now become generally the case that any significant industrial action would lead to Authorities considering whether to make <b>deductions</b> <b>from</b> the <b>pay</b> of workers concerned. Modification to the structure for the provision of public sector education under the Education Acts of the late 1980 s and early 1990 s was a far more important legal influence. This required significant change in established industrial relations and employment practices and could be a cause of dispute to which the labour legislation of the 1980 s was of limited relevance. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{workers who}} participated in the bracero program have {{generated}} significant local and international struggles challenging the U.S. government and Mexican government to identify and return 10 percent mandatory <b>deductions</b> taken <b>from</b> their <b>pay,</b> <b>from</b> 1942 to 1948, for savings accounts that they were legally guaranteed to receive upon their return to Mexico at the conclusion of their contracts. Many field working braceros never received their savings, but most railroad working braceros did. Lawsuits presented in federal courts in California, in the late 1990s and early 2000s (decade), highlighted the substandard conditions and documented the ultimate destiny of the savings accounts deductions, but the suit was thrown out because the Mexican banks in question never operated in the United States. Today, it is stipulated that ex-braceros can receive up to $3,500.00 as compensation for the 10% only by supplying check stubs or contracts proving {{they were part of the}} program during 1942 to 1948. It is estimated that, with interest accumulated, $500 million is owed to ex-braceros, who continue to fight to receive the money owed to them.|$|R
50|$|In August 1918, Macready {{somewhat}} reluctantly {{took the}} post of Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis, head of the London Metropolitan Police, to which Prime Minister Asquith had intended to appoint him before war broke out in 1914. Morale was low, and many men were currently on strike over pay and trade union recognition. Macready got them back to work by granting a pay rise and promising the introduction of machinery for collective bargaining. He was popular among the constables and sergeants, whom he got to know far more than his predecessors had done. He abolished the system of punishment by deducting fines <b>from</b> men's <b>pay</b> {{over a period of}} months or even years. He also abolished the shilling a day <b>deduction</b> made <b>from</b> the <b>pay</b> of men on sick leave. He had an intense dislike of trade unions, and never took the short-lived National Union of Police and Prison Officers seriously, which partly led to the strike of 1919. Only {{a small percentage of the}} men went out on strike, and they were all dismissed, although Macready wrote a good reference for every one who asked.|$|R
