Those films went up seven or eight percent from the initial budget. Titanic also had a large budget to begin with, but it went up a lot more," [...] he said. [...] "As the producer and director, I {{take responsibility for the}} studio that's writing the checks, so I made it less painful for them. I did that on two different occasions. They didn't <b>force</b> <b>me</b> to do it; they were glad that I did." ...|$|E

This was done in numerically reverse order, counting down with the first story shown being ranked fifth but apparently the most important.|$|E

2500|$|Ameriie {{was born}} to a South Korean mother, artist Mi Suk and African American father, Charles. A few months after she was born, the Rogers family moved to South Korea, where Amerie lived for three years. Her father, Charles, was a chief warrant officer in the U.S. military, so the family lived in many {{different}} places, including Alaska, Texas, Virginia and Germany. She has a younger sister, Angela, who is now her lawyer. Amerie describes her parents as conservative, protective, traditional Christians. Growing up, {{she and her sister}} were forbidden to leave the house or use the phone on school days. The singer enrolled at Georgetown University to study literature, and was in Navy ROTC: [...] "My dad didn't <b>force</b> <b>me</b> into it or anything. I joined so I could afford an education." [...] She quit ROTC after her sophomore year, and graduated with a B.A. in English and a Fine Arts minor in design.|$|E
2500|$|Byrne revitalized the {{slumping}} {{title with}} his run. Originally, Byrne was slated to write with Sienkiewicz providing the art. Sienkiewicz {{left to do}} Moon Knight, and Byrne ended up as writer, artist, and inker. Various editors {{were assigned to the}} comic; eventually Bob Budiansky became the regular editor. Byrne told Jim Shooter that he could not work with Budiansky, although they ultimately continued to work together. In 2006, Byrne said [...] "that's my paranoia. I look back and I think that was Shooter trying to <b>force</b> <b>me</b> off the book". Byrne left following issue #293 (Aug. 1986) {{in the middle of a}} story arc, explaining he could not recapture the fun he had previously had on the series. One of Byrne's changes was making the Invisible Girl into the Invisible Woman: assertive and confident. During this period, fans came to recognize that she was quite powerful, whereas previously, she had been primarily seen as a superpowered mother and wife in the tradition of television moms like those played by Donna Reed and Florence Henderson.|$|E
2500|$|... "Three {{organizations}} {{are involved in}} trying to <b>force</b> <b>me</b> off land I legally own — Stephenville Town Council: Stephenville Chamber of Commerce: and Stephenville Lions Club. It was the Chamber of Commerce in 1957 that called for the setting up of a civic park at Long Gull Pond. It is a whisper campaign, to make people believe I am {{standing in the way of}} progress, that I am stubbornly refusing to sell my land thus robbing the people of the west coast their own born-right to boil the kettle on their chosen spot of summer scenery. This argument is full of holes. Firstly, I have stated publicly that a first rate section of my land including frontage along the beach of the pond has been reserved and placed solely at the disposal of all comers without cost. I have offered to make such an arrangement permanent by entering into a proper contract with the appropriate authority. This fact, plus the fact that land is still available elsewhere on the pond, shows that more than just a park is involved.|$|E

2500|$|Fantino {{was criticized}} by lawyer Peter Rosenthal {{during the trial}} of {{aboriginal}} activist Shawn Brant. Fantino was criticized for ordering wiretaps of Brant's phone without proper authority and for making provocative comments to Brant during negotiations to end a blockade of the rail line west of Kingston. By way of those illegal wiretaps, Fantino was recorded saying to Brant [...] "You are going to <b>force</b> <b>me</b> to do everything I can; within your community and everywhere else; to destroy your reputation" [...] and [...] "your whole {{world is going to}} come crashing down" [...] NDP MPP Peter Kormos called for Fantino's resignation accusing him of using [...] "pugnacious and bellicose" [...] rhetoric and for engaging in [...] "Rambo-style policing." [...] In the face of defence motions for the police to disclose more evidence about their conduct the Crown agreed to drop the most serious charges against Brant in exchange for a plea bargain resulting in a light sentence. Fantino was also criticized {{for his role in the}} Caledonia land dispute after he was accused of sending e-mails to local politicians accusing them of encouraging anti-police rallies by non-Natives.|$|E
2500|$|....why {{are you so}} cruel as {{to wring}} from me, as to <b>force</b> <b>me</b> to commit to paper, what I hardly confided to my own bosom, that he [...] and I {{materially}} differ in politics? I may give an occasional support to Mr Pitt...; I do and mean to give such support to {{the measure of the}} present war, to its propriety, its necessity, its justice...; but systematically I continue to be, and am, in opposition to him and his Ministry: there exists many a knotty point to be adjusted between him and me, many difficulties very important in their nature to be smoothed, much obliteration of facts not easy to be affected, and the general face of things strangely to be altered, before I retire from my watch upon his Ministry. ... delivered himself over into the hands of Pitt, formally and professedly, last November. ... He became the standard-bearer of his empire. ... He possessed in as full and ample a degree as ever my respect, my attachment, my affection, my veneration for his virtues, but in this instance he has failed to carry my conviction. ... We differ upon a fundamental point in politics.|$|E
2500|$|Third, {{it appears}} likely that Spinoza {{had already taken}} the {{initiative}} to separate himself from the Talmud Torah congregation and was vocally expressing his hostility to Judaism itself. He had probably stopped attending services at the synagogue, either after the lawsuit with his sister or after the knife attack on its steps. He might already have been voicing the view expressed later in his Theological-Political Treatise that the civil authorities should suppress Judaism as harmful to the Jews themselves. Either for financial or other reasons, he had in any case effectively stopped contributing to the synagogue by March 1656. He had also committed the [...] "monstrous deed," [...] contrary to the regulations of the synagogue and the views of some rabbinical authorities (including Maimonides), of filing suit in a civil court rather than with the synagogue authorities—to renounce his father's heritage, no less. Upon being notified of the issuance of the censure, he {{is reported to have}} said: [...] "Very well; this does not <b>force</b> <b>me</b> to do anything that I would not have done of my own accord, had I not been afraid of a scandal." [...] Thus, unlike most of the censure issued routinely by the Amsterdam congregation to discipline its members, the censure issued against Spinoza did not lead to repentance and so was never withdrawn.|$|E

2500|$|On 26 July 2017 President Poroshenko {{issued a}} decree {{stripping}} Saakashvili of his Ukrainian citizenship, {{but without a}} reason for his doing so being stated. Ukraine's migration service {{said in a statement}} that [...] "according to the Constitution of Ukraine, the president takes decisions on who is stripped of Ukrainian citizenship based on the conclusions of the citizenship commission". [...] Saakashvili, in response to his being stripped of citizenship, replied: [...] "I have only one citizenship, that of Ukraine, and I will not be deprived of it! Now there is an attempt under way to <b>force</b> <b>me</b> to become a refugee. This will not happen! I will fight for my legal right to return to Ukraine!" [...] A Ukrainian legislator from the Petro Poroshenko Bloc faction in parliament, Serhiy Leshchenko, said that Saakashvili was (when Poroshenko issued his decree) in the United States, but that if he sought to return to Ukraine, he would face extradition to Georgia to face charges for alleged crimes that occurred during his presidency there. According to The Economist, most observers saw Poroshenko's stripping Saakashvili of his citizenship [...] "simply as the sidelining of a political rival" [...] (at the time political polls gave Saakashvili's political party Movement of New Forces around 2% in a hypothetical early election). On 28 July (2017) Saakashvili told Newshour he wanted to return to Ukraine to [...] "get rid of the old corrupt elite" [...] there.|$|E
