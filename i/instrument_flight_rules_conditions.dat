50|$|Navy {{air traffic}} {{controllers}} perform duties similar to civilian {{air traffic controllers}} and {{play a key role}} in the effective use of naval airpower throughout the world in operational and training environments. Navy ACs are responsible for safely and effectively directing aircraft operating from airfields or the decks of aircraft carriers. They also control the movement of aircraft and vehicles on airfield taxiways and issue flight instructions to pilots by radio. Air traffic controllers provide air traffic control services in air traffic control towers, radar air traffic control facilities, fleet area control and surveillance facilities, and air operations offices ashore and afloat. They also operate radio communication systems and light signals, direct aircraft under visual flight rules and <b>instrument</b> <b>flight</b> <b>rules</b> <b>conditions,</b> and operate surveillance radar, precision radar, data link approach systems and secondary surveillance radar (IFF) equipment. Other tasks include operation of ground and shipboard controlled approach systems, response to emergency air traffic situations, maintenance of current flight planning information and reference material, assistance of pilots in preparation and processing flight plans and clearances. Standards for entry into the AC field are high, but once accepted into the field, Navy ACs enjoy a demanding and highly rewarding career. This is a five-year enlistment program.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop enhancement and multi-sensor fusion algorithms and techniques to make it safer for the pilot to fly in what would normally be considered <b>Instrument</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Rules</b> (IFR) <b>conditions,</b> where pilot visibility is severely restricted due to fog, haze or other weather phenomenon. We proposed to use the non-linear Multiscale Retinex (MSR) as the basic driver for developing an integrated enhancement and fusion engine. When we started this research, the MSR was being applied primarily to grayscale imagery such as medical images, or to three-band color imagery, such as that produced in consumer photography: it was not, however, being applied to other imagery such as that produced by infrared image sources. However, we felt that it was possible by using the MSR algorithm in conjunction with multiple imaging modalities such as long-wave infrared (LWIR), short-wave infrared (SWIR), and visible spectrum (VIS), we could substantially improve over the then state-of-the-art enhancement algorithms, especially in poor visibility conditions. We proposed the following tasks: 1) Investigate the effects of applying the MSR to LWIR and SWIR images. This consisted of optimizing the algorithm in terms of surround scales, and weights for these spectral bands; 2) Fusing the LWIR and SWIR images with the VIS images using the MSR framework to determine the best possible representation of the desired features; 3) Evaluating different mixes of LWIR, SWIR and VIS bands for maximum fog and haze reduction, and low light level compensation; 4) Modifying the existing algorithms to work with video sequences. Over the course of the 3 year research period, we were able to accomplish these tasks and report on them at various internal presentations at NASA Langley Research Center, and in presentations and publications elsewhere. A description of the work performed under the tasks is provided in Section 2. The complete list of relevant publications during the research periods is provided in Section 5.
