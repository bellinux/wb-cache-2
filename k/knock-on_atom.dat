5000|$|Radiation {{damage to}} {{materials}} occurs {{as a result}} of the interaction of an energetic incident particle (a neutron, or otherwise) with a lattice atom in the material. The collision causes a massive transfer of kinetic energy to the lattice atom, which is displaced from its lattice site, becoming what is known as the primary <b>knock-on</b> <b>atom</b> (PKA). Because the PKA is surrounded by other lattice atoms, its displacement and passage through the lattice results in many subsequent collisions and the creations of additional knock-on atoms, producing what is known as the collision cascade or displacement cascade. The knock-on atoms lose energy with each collision, and terminate as interstitials, effectively creating a series of Frenkel defects in the lattice. Heat is also created {{as a result of the}} collisions (from electronic energy loss), as are possibly transmuted atoms. The magnitude of the damage is such that a single 1 MeV neutron creating a PKA in an iron lattice produces approximately 1100 Frenkel pairs. The entire cascade event occurs over a timescale of 10^-13 seconds, and therefore, can only be 'observed' in computer simulations of the event ...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} electrosprayed nanodroplets on {{ceramics}} at several km/s alters the atomic {{order of the}} target, causing sputtering, surface amorphization and cratering. The molecular mass of the projectile {{is known to have}} a strong effect on the impact phenomenology, and this article aims to rationalize this dependency using molecular dynamics. To achieve this goal, the article models the impact of four projectiles with molecular masses between 45 and 391 amu, and identical diameters and kinetic energies, 10 nm and 63 keV, striking a silicon target. In agreement with experiments, the simulations show that the number of sputtered atoms strongly increases with molecular mass. This is due to the increasing intensity of collision cascades with molecular mass: when the fixed kinetic energy of the projectile is distributed among fewer, more massive molecules, their collisions with the target produce <b>knock-on</b> <b>atoms</b> with higher energies, which in turn generate more energetic and larger numbers of secondary and tertiary <b>knock-on</b> <b>atoms.</b> The more energetic collision cascades intensify both knock-on sputtering and, upon thermalization, thermal sputtering.

The framework examines the effect of impact damage caused by a <b>knock-on</b> <b>atom</b> with velocities corresponding to four different kinetic energy levels (50 eV, 500 eV, 1 keV, and 2 keV) in three different SiC structure samples with different grain boundary (GB) configurations. Analyses show that peak tensile strength of the examined structures decreases by up to 37 % in samples with GBs due to the impact damage caused by <b>knock-on</b> <b>atom</b> {{when compared with the}} case of single crystalline SiC under similar conditions. Analyses reveal new insights regarding the influence of bond strength change under <b>knock-on</b> <b>atom</b> induced impact damage on peak tensile strength of the examined structures. It is found that the peak tensile strength of the examined structures is a function of change in temperature, impact energy, and GB configuration. In order to extend the observed correlation of the peak tensile strength with atomic configurations to other structure types, a fractal dimension-based approach is adopted to predict structure peak tensile strength as a function of <b>knock-on</b> <b>atom</b> impact energy, temperature, and GB configuration. Analyses show that the tensile strength of the examined SiC structures increases as a function of their fractal dimension increase. Fractal dimensions also change as a function of change in impact energy level and the corresponding damage in an inversely proportional manner. Based on the observed correlations, an empirical relation to predict structure peak tensile strength as a function of simulation parameters is developed. The developed relation is found to predict strength data of structures not included in the fitting with good accuracy...|$|E

40|$|There are {{two main}} {{components}} to the irradiation spectrum which {{need to be considered}} in radiation effects studies on nonmetals, namely the primary <b>knock-on</b> <b>atom</b> energy spectrum and ionizing radiation. The published low-temperature studies on A 1203 and MgO suggest that the defect production is nearly independent of the average primary <b>knock-on</b> <b>atom</b> energy, {{in sharp contrast to the}} situation for metals. On the other hand, ionizing radiation has been shown to exert a pronounced influence on the microstructural evolution of both semiconductors and insulators under certain conditions. Recent work on the microstructure of ion-irradiated ceramics is summarized, which provides evidence for significant ionization-induced diffusion. Polycrystalline samples of MgO, A 120 3, and MgAJ 20 4 were irradiated with various ions ranging from 1 MeV H ' to 4 MeV Zr * ions at temperatures between 25 and 650 °C. Cross-section transmission electron microscopy was used to investigate the depth-dependent microstructure of the irradiated specimens. Dislocation loop nucleation was effectively suppressed in specimens irradiated with light ions, whereas the growth rate of dislocation loops was enhanced. The sensitivity to irradiation spectrum is attributed to ionization-induced diffusion.
