40|$|Foodborne disease {{outbreaks}} {{associated with the}} protozoan parasite Cryptosporidium spp. are an emerging public health concern. Shellfish, including <b>Eastern</b> <b>oysters</b> (Crassostrea virginica) in Chesapeake Bay and other Atlantic coastal waters, {{have been identified as}} a potential source of Cryptosporidium parvum infection for humans. The inactivation of C. parvum and other pathogens in raw molluscan shellfish would provide increased food safety for normal and at-risk consumers. The objectives of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of three alternative food-processing treatments (e-beam irradiation, microwave energy, and high hydrostatic pressure processing) on the viability of C. parvum oocysts in <b>Eastern</b> <b>oysters.</b> Oysters were artificially infected with the Beltsville strain of C. parvum and subjected to the three treatments in separate experiments. The effects of the treatments were evaluated by inoculation of the processed oyster tissues using the neonatal mouse bioassay. E-beam radiation of in-shell and shucked oysters treated with doses of 1. 0, 1. 5 or 2. 0 kGy produced significant reductions (P < 0. 05) in C. parvum mouse infectivity.

40|$|A {{colorimetric}} method for indirect measurement of glycogen concentrations in tissue homogenates of <b>eastern</b> <b>oysters</b> (Crassostrea virginica) was evaluated. This method uses a conversion of glycogen to glucose by amyloglucosidase. The procedure was optimized Fur extracting buffer pH (5. 0) and amyloglucosidase concentration (5 mg/mL). Coefficients of variation(n = 10) for oyster homogenates with mean glycogen concentrations of 84 and 242 mg/dL had within-run Values of 3. 29 and 3. 66 %, and between-run results of 4. 46 and 3. 15 %, respectively. When mean glycogen concentrations of thawed oyster homogenates {{were compared with}} those of initial fresh homogenates, no significant (P {{less than or equal to}} 0. 05) differences were detected in samples thawed after 1 h, 1 day, 1 wk, or 1 mo. Glycogen recovery percentages of 104. 1, 103. 7, and 104. 5 % were obtained with mixed solutions containing 111, 94, and 19 mg/dL glycogen, respectively. The lower limit of sensitivity for the procedure was approximately 14 mL/dL. The assay was considered to be linear to 436 mg/dL. Lyophilized samples appeared to provide the most reliable determination of glycogen concentrations per gram of tissue by avoiding variable water content in oyster tissues. Initial laboratory ranges for tissue glycogen based on wet (mean +/- 2 SD: 7 - 43 mg/g) and dry (mean +/- 2 SD: 19 - 145 mg/g) weights were determined with 49 second-year growth oysters obtained during July 1998 (Covehead, Prince Edward Island, Canada).

40|$|Estuarine {{organisms are}} exposed to {{periodic}} strong fluctuations in seawater pH driven by biological carbon dioxide (CO 2) production, which may in the future be further exacerbated by the ocean acidification associated with the global rise in CO 2. Calcium carbonate-producing marine species such as mollusks {{are expected to be}} vulnerable to acidification of estuarine waters, since elevated CO 2 concentration and lower pH lead to a decrease in the degree of saturation of water with respect to calcium carbonate, potentially affecting biomineralization. Our study demonstrates that the increase in CO 2 partial pressure (pCO 2) in seawater and associated decrease in pH within the environmentally relevant range for estuaries have negative effects on physiology, rates of shell deposition and mechanical properties of the shells of <b>eastern</b> <b>oysters</b> Crassostrea virginica (Gmelin). High CO 2 levels (pH ~ 7. 5, pCO 2 ~ 3500 µatm) caused significant increases in juvenile mortality rates and inhibited both shell and soft-body growth compared to the control conditions (pH ~ 8. 2, pCO 2 ~ 380 µatm). Furthermore, elevated CO 2 concentrations resulted in higher standard metabolic rates in oyster juveniles, likely due to the higher energy cost of homeostasis. The high CO 2 conditions also led to changes in the ultrastructure and mechanical properties of shells, including increased thickness of the calcite laths within the hypostracum and reduced hardness and fracture toughness of the shells, indicating that elevated CO 2 levels have negative effects on the biomineralization process. These data strongly suggest that the rise in CO 2 can impact physiology and biomineralization in marine calcifiers such as <b>eastern</b> <b>oysters,</b> threatening their survival and potentially leading to profound ecological and economic impacts in estuarine ecosystems...|$|R
50|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>oyster</b> (Crassostrea virginica)—also called Wellfleet oyster, Atlantic oyster, Virginia oyster, or American oyster—is {{a species}} of true oyster native to the eastern seaboard and Gulf of Mexico coast of North America.

50|$|This {{particular}} type of oyster has an important environmental value. Like all oysters, C. virginica is a filter feeder. They suck in water and filter out the plankton and detritus to swallow, then spit the water back out, thus cleaning the water around them. One oyster can filter more than 50 gallons of water in 24 hours. <b>Eastern</b> <b>oysters</b> also provide a key structural element within their ecosystem, making them a foundation species in many environments, and they serve as ecosystem engineers in western Atlantic estuaries. Similar to coral reefs, oyster beds provide key habitat {{for a variety of}} different species by creating hard substrate for attachment and habitation. Oyster beds have an estimated 50 times the surface area of an equally sized flat bottom. The beds also attract a high concentration of larger predators looking for food.|$|R
50|$|Between {{the effect}} that {{temperature}} has on Mg:Ca ratios {{as well as on}} solubility and saturation state of calcite and aragonite, it is clear that short- or long-term temperature variations can influence the deposition of calcium carbonate by altering seawater chemistry. The impact that these temperature-induced chemical changes have on shell deposition has been repeatedly demonstrated for a wide array of organisms that inhabit estuarine and coastal systems, highlighting the cumulative effect of all temperature-influenced factors.The blue mussel Mytilus edulis is a major space occupier on hard substrates on the east coast of North America and west coast of Europe, and the calcification rate of this species increases up to five times with rising temperature. <b>Eastern</b> <b>oysters</b> and crustose coralline algae have also been shown to increase their calcification rates with elevated temperature, though this can have varied effects on the morphology of the organism.|$|R
