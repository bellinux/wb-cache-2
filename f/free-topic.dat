30|$|Test {{items were}} {{developed}} {{based on a}} corpus of natural spoken Chinese and field notes taken in China. The corpus, Chinese Annotated Dialogue and Conversation Corpus 1, was the only available natural Chinese speech corpus found {{for the purpose of}} this study. The corpus consists of 12 extended <b>free-topic</b> conversations (approximately 16.2  h in total) between native Chinese speakers (e.g., classmates, colleagues) recorded in daily settings (e.g., dorms, offices). The researcher read through the transcripts and identified 29 utterances expressing implied meaning. The other resource was the researcher’s field notes taken in China in 2013 for this project. The field notes contained utterances encoding Chinese indirect communication that the researcher observed in daily settings (e.g., university campus, restaurants, offices, and home) between friends, relatives, colleagues, and strangers. The researcher read through the field notes and identified 19 utterances expressing implied meaning. For example, one field note entry documented the use of 再说吧 (literal meaning: “Say it again”; implied meaning: “Let’s discuss it later”) to turn down an invitation between two friends, and this utterance was later included in the instrument.|$|E
40|$|Idea Density (ID) {{measures}} {{the rate at}} which ideas or elementary predications are expressed in an utterance or in a text. Lower ID is found to be associated with an increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease (AD) (Snowdon et al., 1996; Engelman et al., 2010). ID has been used in two different versions: propositional idea density (PID) counts the expressed ideas and can be applied to any text while semantic idea density (SID) counts pre-defined information content units and is naturally more applicable to normative domains, such as picture description tasks. In this paper, we develop DEPID, a novel dependency-based method for computing PID, and its version DEPID-R that enables to exclude repeating ideas [...] -a feature characteristic to AD speech. We conduct the first comparison of automatically extracted PID and SID in the diagnostic classification task on two different AD datasets covering both closed-topic and free-recall domains. While SID performs better on the normative dataset, adding PID leads to a small but significant improvement (+ 1. 7 F-score). On the <b>free-topic</b> dataset, PID performs better than SID as expected (77. 6 vs 72. 3 in F-score) but adding the features derived from the word embedding clustering underlying the automatic SID increases the results considerably, leading to an F-score of 84. 8.
