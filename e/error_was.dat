5|$|On 16 November 2010, {{five months}} after the Court of Inquiry was constituted, it {{submitted}} its report with input from the NTSB and Boeing, and stated that pilot <b>error</b> <b>was</b> the cause of the accident since the flight path was incorrect.|$|E
5|$|An enquiry {{into the}} crash was hastily set up. The commission's report (Aktenzeichen 52, Br.B.Nr. 270/42) {{concluded}} that the crash was caused by damage to the differential gear, which caused an oil leak. Then a number of teeth broke off the spur wheel and ignited the oil. Sabotage or human <b>error</b> <b>was</b> ruled out. The aircraft, W. Nr. 14256, was ferried to the unit via Bari, Italy. The mission that ended in its destruction was its first mission.|$|E
5|$|In two years, a {{very precise}} map, drawn on six sheets at a 1/200,000 scale, was produced. In March 1829, {{a base of}} 3,500 meters had been traced in the Argolis, from one angle at the ruins of Tiryns to an angle of a house in ruins {{in the village of}} Aria. This was {{intended}} to serve as a point of departure in all the triangulation operations for topographic and geodesic readings in the Peloponnese. Pierre Peytier and Puillon-Boblaye proceeded to perform numerous verifications on the base and on the rulers used. The margin of <b>error</b> <b>was</b> thus reduced to 1 meter for every 15 kilometers. The longitude and latitude of the base point at Tiryns were read and checked, so that again the margin of <b>error</b> <b>was</b> reduced as far as possible to an estimated 0.2 seconds. 134 geodesic stations were set up on the peninsula’s mountains, as well as on Aegina, Hydra and Nafplion. Thus, equilateral triangles whose sides measured about 20km were drawn. The angles were measured with theodolites by Gambey.|$|E

5|$|The United States Coast Guard {{performed}} an investigation {{and found that}} captain's <b>error</b> <b>was</b> {{the main cause of}} the wreck; however, no criminal liability was established and the captain and crew were not charged.

5|$|The {{availability}} of criminal {{appeals to the}} Supreme Court by means of writs of error from the circuit courts was perhaps an open question prior to More.

5|$|The {{technique}} used to analyse the BFO values was validated against 87 aircraft {{with the same}} SATCOM equipment operating in the region {{around the time of}} Flight 370's disappearance and against 9 previous flights operated by the same aircraft (9M-MRO). The sensitivity to <b>error</b> <b>was</b> calculated during the early phase of Flight 370 when the aircraft's location, track, and ground speed were known. This resulted in an uncertainty of ±28° heading and ±9° of latitude.|$|E

5|$|F-22 fighter {{units have}} been {{frequently}} deployed to Kadena Air Base in Okinawa, Japan. In February 2007, on the aircraft's first overseas deployment to Kadena Air Base, six F-22s of 27th Fighter Squadron flying from Hickam AFB, Hawaii, experienced multiple software-related system failures while crossing the International Date Line (180th meridian of longitude). The aircraft returned to Hawaii by following tanker aircraft. Within 48 hours, the <b>error</b> <b>was</b> resolved and the journey resumed. In early 2013, F-22s {{were involved in}} U.S.-South Korean military drills.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Lewis Fry Richardson {{published}} {{the first attempt}} at forecasting the weather numerically. Using a hydrostatic variation of Bjerknes's primitive equations, Richardson produced by hand a 6-hour forecast {{for the state of}} the atmosphere over two points in central Europe, taking at least six weeks to do so. His forecast calculated that the change in surface pressure would be , an unrealistic value incorrect by two orders of magnitude. The large <b>error</b> <b>was</b> caused by an imbalance in the pressure and wind velocity fields used as the initial conditions in his analysis.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Dutch {{graduate}} student Cyprianus Annius van den Bosch made {{a determination of}} the mass of Mars based upon the motions of the Martian moons, with an accuracy of 0.2%. This result was confirmed by the Dutch astronomer Willem de Sitter and published posthumously in 1938. Using observations of the near Earth asteroid Eros from 1926 to 1945, German-American astronomer Eugene K. Rabe was able to make an independent estimate the mass of Mars, {{as well as the other}} planets in the inner Solar System, from the planet's gravitational perturbations of the asteroid. His estimated margin of <b>error</b> <b>was</b> 0.05%, but subsequent checks suggested his result was poorly determined compared to other methods.|$|E
50|$|Like other coins, {{the value}} of <b>errors</b> <b>is</b> based, in part at least, on rarity and condition. In general, lower {{denomination}} <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> less expensive than higher denomination errors simply more such coins are minted resulting in available <b>errors.</b> Modern <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> generally less expensive than older errors simply because, with billions being struck, <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> made. Because of modern technology, some types of <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> less likely to occur now, {{but that has not}} seemed to have a dramatic impact on values. Some types of errors, such as clipped planchets, edge strikes, and foreign object strike-throughs can be faked perhaps keeping down {{the value of}} some types of mint <b>errors.</b> Many <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> sold ungraded because of their relatively low value. Grading services often charge more to grade a coin than it <b>is</b> worth. <b>Errors</b> <b>are</b> often not noted by grading services.Overdates, mules, brockage, double denomination, and struck on the wrong planchet <b>errors</b> <b>are</b> often valuable. <b>Errors</b> on ancient, medieval, and higher-value coins are usually detrimental to the coin's numismatic value.|$|R

5|$|In 2000, a North Shore Towers {{resident}} {{noticed a}} zip code error when making an online purchase. After further investigation in 2001, {{it was determined}} that the North Shore Towers was one of four zip codes that were mistakenly charged a Nassau County sales tax of 8.5% instead of the New York City sales tax of 8.25% because the zip codes cross the city line. Residents argued that New York City should receive their tax dollars and not Nassau County. This <b>error</b> <b>was</b> corrected by late 2001.|$|E
5|$|On a computer, if {{the result}} of an {{addition}} is too large to store, an arithmetic overflow occurs, resulting in an incorrect answer. Unanticipated arithmetic overflow is a fairly common cause of program errors. Such overflow bugs may be hard to discover and diagnose because they may manifest themselves only for very large input data sets, which {{are less likely to be}} used in validation tests. One especially notable such <b>error</b> <b>was</b> the Y2K bug, where overflow errors due to using a 2-digit format for years caused significant computer problems in 2000.|$|E
5|$|The Court of Appeals {{held that}} Blacksmith could {{independently}} bring the claim for trespass, {{for which he}} need only show a right to possession. The Court of Appeals also held that Fellows' title was invalid, because the payment of compensation was a condition precedent. Welles, in dissent, agreed that Blacksmith could individually sue for trespass, but disagreed that the appraisal was a condition precedent; he would have reversed and granted a new trial, with costs. The Court of Appeals remanded back to the Supreme Court, after which a writ of <b>error</b> <b>was</b> granted by the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E

5|$|The {{captain and}} most of the crew of the shipall {{nationals}} of the Philippineshad to face a U.S. Coast Guard Board of Inquiry, which required them to remain in the United States for several weeks after the wreck. In addition, a federal grand jury investigated the incident for criminal wrongdoing. Captain Morgado refused to answer many of the questions posed at the inquiry, citing his Fifth Amendment rights. The crew was released after their testimony and returned to the Philippines. On September 16, the Coast Guard issued its findings that captain's <b>error</b> <b>was</b> the primary cause of the wreck, with the first and third officers of the ship also partly responsible. The investigation found no evidence of criminal wrongdoing, and no charges were filed against any member of the New Carissa crew.|$|E
5|$|Within a {{few years}} after Stearn {{returned}} from the war, his Art of Botanical Illustration (1950) was published, remaining the standard work on the subject to this day. There was, however, some bibliographic confusionCollins, the publisher, had planned a book on botanical art for its New Naturalist series, but mistakenly commissioned both Stearn and the art historian Wilfred Blunt independently to produce the work. After the <b>error</b> <b>was</b> discovered the two decided to collaborate; Blunt wrote the work while Stearn edited and revised it. When it was published, Blunt's name was on the title page, while Stearn was only acknowledged in the preface.

5|$|By 4 {{days before}} Isabel made landfall, most {{computer}} models predicted Isabel {{to make landfall}} between North Carolina and New Jersey, and the National Hurricane Center consistently forecast a landfall on North Carolina. Initially, forecasters predicted a landfall in the northeastern portion of the state, though as the hurricane neared land the predicted landfall position was much closer to where it ultimately was. From three days in advance, the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36miles (58km), and for 48hours in advance the average track <b>error</b> <b>was</b> 18miles (29km). Strong confidence in Isabel's final landfall prompted the National Hurricane Center to issue a hurricane watch for the entire North Carolina coastline about 50hours before Isabel struck land. 38hours before the hurricane made landfall, the National Hurricane Center upgraded the watch to a hurricane warning for the landfall area. The Newport Weather Forecast Office issued a flood potential statement two days before landfall, which indicated a threat for flash flooding. The office began preparing for the hurricane one week before landfall, and brought additional staff members to assist with hurricane related duties.|$|E
5|$|In the 400m {{freestyle}} heats, Windle and Talbot made a misjudgement; in {{an attempt}} to conserve his energy for the final they decided that Windle should not go flat out, and Windle was four seconds slower than he was at the Australian Championships. Windle was one of the top seeds for the race, and Talbot advised him to swim hard {{in the first half of}} the race before slowing down. However, he swam too slowly and missed the final completely. Although he won his heat by seven seconds in a time of 4min 21.6s, he was the ninth fastest overall, so he missed the final by one position with a time deficit of 0.5s. The slowest qualifier was Tsuyoshi Yamanaka, who had been prevented from withdrawing from the race by his coaches. On the other hand, the two other Australian representatives who he defeated at the national championships did make the final, including Wood, who went on to win bronze. Talbot said that the tactical <b>error</b> <b>was</b> mostly his responsibility and that he learnt a lot from it.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{globular}} clusters within the Milky Way, {{the majority are}} found in a halo around the galactic core, and the large majority {{are located in the}} celestial sky centered on the core. In 1918, this strongly asymmetrical distribution was used by Shapley to make a determination of the overall dimensions of the galaxy. By assuming a roughly spherical distribution of {{globular clusters}} around the galaxy's center, he used the positions of the clusters to estimate the position of the Sun relative to the galactic center. While his distance estimate was in significant error (although within the same order of magnitude as the currently accepted value), it did demonstrate that the dimensions of the galaxy were much greater than had been previously thought. His <b>error</b> <b>was</b> due to interstellar dust in the Milky Way, which absorbs and diminishes the amount of light from distant objects, such as globular clusters, that reaches the Earth, thus making them appear to be more distant than they are.|$|E
