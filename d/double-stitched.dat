5|$|In the {{original}} series, divisions in ship assignments were denoted by shirt color; for the movie, these color codes {{were moved to}} small patches on each person's uniform. The Starfleet delta symbol, which previously indicated duty branches—command, science, medical, engineering, and so forth—was replaced with the command symbol for all branches, superimposed over a circle of color indicating area of service. The blue color of previous uniforms was discarded, for fear they might interfere with the blue screens used for optical effects. Three types of uniforms were fabricated: dress uniforms used for special occasions, Class A uniforms for regular duty, and Class B uniforms as an alternative. The Class A designs were <b>double-stitched</b> in gabardine and featured gold braid designating rank. It was felt that the traditional four gold sleeve stripes for the captain's rank was too blatantly militaristic. Povill had to send out a memo to Fletcher with the modified stripe rank system, as the designer continued to get the 20th and 23rd centuries confused. Fletcher designed the Class B uniform as similar to evolved T-shirts, with shoulder boards used to indicate rank and service divisions. Each costume had the shoes built into the pant leg to further the futuristic look. An Italian shoemaker decorated by the Italian government for making Gucci shoes was tasked with creating the futuristic footwear. Combining the shoes and trousers was difficult, time-consuming, and expensive, as each shoe had to be sewn by hand after being fitted to each principal actor. There were difficulties in communication, as the shoemaker spoke limited English and occasionally confused shoe orders due to similar-sounding names. Jumpsuits, serving a more utilitarian function, were the only costumes to have pockets, and were made with a heavyweight spandex that required a special needle to puncture the thick material. A variety of field jackets, leisure wear, and spacesuits were also created; as these parts had to be designed and completed before most of the actors' parts had been cast, many roles were filled by considering how well the actors would fit into existing costumes.|$|E
60|$|The voice {{belonged to}} the gentleman Miss Blank had never seen before. He straddled his long legs on the hearthrug. Jermyn, leaning forward, held his pocket-handkerchief spread out before the grate. He looked back dismally over his shoulder, and as I slipped {{behind one of the}} little wooden tables, I nodded to him. On {{the other side of the}} fire, imposingly calm and large, sat Mr. Stonor, jammed tight into a capacious Windsor armchair. There was nothing small about him but his short, white side-whiskers. Yards and yards of extra superfine blue cloth (made up into an overcoat) reposed on a chair by his side. And he must just have brought some liner from sea, because another chair was smothered under his black waterproof, ample as a pall, and made of {{three-fold}} oiled silk, <b>double-stitched</b> throughout. A man's hand-bag of the usual size looked like a child's toy on the floor near his feet.|$|E
60|$|In {{her bedroom}} Saxon {{completed}} her dressing, {{for an instant}} stepping upon a chair so as to glimpse critically in the small wall-mirror the hang of her ready-made linen skirt. This, and the jacket, she had altered to fit, and she had <b>double-stitched</b> the seams to achieve the coveted tailored effect. Still on the chair, all {{in the moment of}} quick clear-seeing, she drew the skirt tightly back and raised it. The sight was good to her, nor did she under-appraise the lines of the slender ankle above the low tan tie nor did she under-appraise the delicate yet mature swell of calf outlined in the fresh brown of a new cotton stocking. Down from the chair, she pinned on a firm sailor hat of white straw with a brown ribbon around the crown that matched her ribbon belt. She rubbed her cheeks quickly and fiercely to bring back the color Sarah had driven out of them, and delayed a moment longer to put on her tan lisle-thread gloves. Once, in the fashion-page of a Sunday supplement, she had read that no lady ever put on her gloves after she left the door.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to his extensive political writing, Weitling was a successful inventor of attachments for commercial sewing machines, including devices for <b>double-stitching</b> {{and the creation of}} button holes.|$|R
50|$|The special-edition BMW i8 Protonic Red Edition {{model was}} {{unveiled}} at the 2016 Geneva International Motor Show. The Protonic Red Edition will be produced at BMW Plant Leipzig from July 2016. This special edition car sports a Protonic Red paint finish with accents in Frozen Grey metallic. The colour scheme is complemented by BMW W-spoke 470 light-alloy wheels painted in Orbit Grey metallic with hubs painted in Aluminium matt and mixed-size tires (front: 215/45 R20, rear: 245/40 R20). Inside the car features red <b>double-stitching</b> and applications in high-grade carbon fibre and ceramic trim.|$|R
50|$|The Avenue Q puppets, {{which cost}} up to $10,000 each, and require up to 120 hours of hand {{fabrication}} per character, were designed and built by original cast member Rick Lyon. Lyon's company, Lyon Puppets, continues to build and maintain the puppets used in all North American productions, {{and several of the}} international productions, including those from the UK, Australia, Mexico, Argentina and Brazil, while supervising the construction of those from the Finnish and Swedish productions. Their unusually sturdy construction, with <b>double-stitching,</b> reinforced seams, steel boning, and custom fake fur and feathers, is necessitated by the rigors of an eight-shows-per-week performance schedule.|$|R

50|$|The swimsuits themselves, which {{resemble}} board shorts, are paneled swimsuits, with waistbands resembling {{those of}} boxing trunks, always <b>double-stitched,</b> always with {{two layers of}} fabric. These shorts are known and favored among surfers, lifeguards, and paddleboarders, because of their quick-drying design and extreme durability; with an estimated 10 years for average use, and 2-5 for more strenuous use.|$|E
50|$|The second-generation Murano {{included}} new features, some {{of which}} were optional or available only on the LE grade, including rain-sensing wipers, <b>double-stitched</b> leather seats, power rear lift gate, power fold-up rear seats, iPod integration, and a hard-drive based, touchscreen navigation system. The S and SL feature aluminum interior accents, while the LE sports wood-tone trim. Like the first-generation model, there is no third-row seat.|$|E
5000|$|The 2003 {{model was}} given a number of under the skin {{upgrades}} including a new security system, a numerically higher final drive ratio (for better acceleration - decreasing highway fuel economy), reprogrammed TCU, and during the year, a satellite radio option. The CD player was now a {{one at a time}} feed into the dash. The Q45 received a number of upgrades for the 2005 model year, including new front and rear fascias, restyled hood and grille, restyled trunk lid, new headlight design, integrated fog lights and LED taillights. Inside were new contoured <b>double-stitched</b> seats, white luminescent gauge markings, chrome accents and dark maple trim. 2005 upgrades also included a recalibrated transmission and new 17" [...] alloy wheels.|$|E
50|$|Horse tie-up collar. A collar {{designed}} to teach horses to tie up and to tie stallions at public events. It is constructed from <b>double-stitched</b> wide leather (sometimes fleece lined), with heavy duty dees sewn into each end. The collar is placed on a horse just behind the poll strap of a headcollar (headstall) which is used in conjunction, and a strong rope passes through the headcollar to secure the two dees so that the horse's wind is not impaired in any way. This manner of application will {{reduce the likelihood of}} the collar slipping and injuring or choking the horse. Sometimes used for tethering horses, they are expensive and are potentially dangerous if the horse should become entangled in the tether or frightened etc.|$|E
