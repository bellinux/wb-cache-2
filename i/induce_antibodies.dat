5|$|Immunity (or, more accurately, tolerance) to P.falciparum malaria {{does occur}} naturally, {{but only in}} {{response}} to years of repeated infection. An individual can be protected from a P.falciparum infection if they receive about a thousand bites from mosquitoes that carry {{a version of the}} parasite rendered non-infective by a dose of X-ray irradiation. The highly polymorphic nature of many P.falciparum proteins results in significant challenges to vaccine design. Vaccine candidates that target antigens on gametes, zygotes, or ookinetes in the mosquito midgut aim to block the transmission of malaria. These transmission-blocking vaccines <b>induce</b> <b>antibodies</b> in the human blood; when a mosquito takes a blood meal from a protected individual, these antibodies prevent the parasite from completing its development in the mosquito. Other vaccine candidates, targeting the blood-stage of the parasite's life cycle, have been inadequate on their own. For example, SPf66 was tested extensively in areas where the disease is common in the 1990s, but trials showed it to be insufficiently effective.|$|E
25|$|Adult {{hookworm}} antigens {{have also}} been identified as potential candidates for vaccines. When adult worms attach to the intestinal mucosa of the human host, erythrocytes are ruptured in the worm’s digestive tract which causes the release of free hemoglobin which is subsequently degraded by a proteolytic cascade. Several of these proteins {{that are responsible for}} this proteolytic cascade are also essential for the worm’s nutrition and survival. Therefore, a vaccine that could <b>induce</b> <b>antibodies</b> for these antigens could interfere with the hookworm’s digestive pathway and impair the worm’s survival. Three proteins have been identified: the aspartic protease-hemoglobinase APR-1, the cysteine protease-hemoglobinase CP-2, and a glutathione S-transferase.|$|E
25|$|The genetic {{diversity}} of HIV presents an enormous challenge for researchers. And, because {{the virus has}} the ability to evade neutralizing antibodies produced by natural immunity, the standard vaccine strategy of mimicking natural infection to <b>induce</b> <b>antibodies</b> has so far proved impossible. Strengthening cell-mediated immunity offers another possible route to success. About 90% of candidate HIV vaccines in development use this approach. These products will not prevent infection. But it is hoped that they will lower viral load and therefore progression to AIDS and secondary transmissions. Some observers believe that a vaccine to prevent HIV will never be achieved. Ultimately, even if an HIV preventive vaccine were to be developed, they are unlikely to be 100% effective. It has come to be realised that no single approach alone will be able to stem the spread of HIV. The future of HIV prevention will most likely involve combining new methods with existing approaches, such as condom use.|$|E

40|$|Objective Role of {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} (ROS) modified human Immunoglobulin G (IgG) in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) has been investigated. Methods Human IgG was modified by hydroxyl-radicals. Immunogenicity of native and modified human IgG was probed by <b>inducing</b> polyclonal <b>antibodies</b> in rabbits. Cross-reactions of <b>induced</b> <b>antibodies</b> with nucleic acid, chromatin, different blood proteins and their ROS modified conformers were determined by competitive inhibition ELISA. The binding characteristics of circulating autoantibodies in SLE patients (n = 72) against native and modified IgG were screened by direct binding and competition ELISA {{and the results were}} compared with healthy age-matched controls (n = 39). Results <b>Induced</b> <b>antibodies</b> against ROS-modified human IgG exhibited diverse antigen binding characteristics. Native DNA, native chromatin and their ROS-modified conformers were found to be effective inhibitors of induced antibody-immunogen interaction. <b>Induced</b> <b>antibodies</b> against native human IgG showed negligible binding to the above mentioned nucleic acid antigens. SLE sera (48. 6 %) showed strong binding to ROS-human IgG in comparison with its native analogue (P 0. 05). Conclusion ROS-induced modifications in human IgG present neo-epitopes, and make it a potential immunogen. The <b>induced</b> <b>antibodies</b> against ROS-modified human IgG resembled the diverse antigen-binding characteristics of naturally occurring SLE anti-DNA autoantibodies.

50|$|A subunit vaccine {{presents}} an antigen to {{the immune system}} without introducing viral particles, whole or otherwise. One method of production involves isolation of a specific protein from a virus or bacterium (such as a bacterial toxin) and administering this by itself. A weakness of this technique is that isolated proteins may have a different three-dimensional structure than the protein in its normal context, and will <b>induce</b> <b>antibodies</b> that may not recognize the infectious organism. In addition, subunit vaccines often elicit weaker antibody responses than the other classes of vaccines.|$|E

Infection was also augmented using reassortant viruses which shared only the HA or the NA of the virus used to <b>induce</b> <b>antibodies.</b> Specific antisera to purified HA or NA also enhanced virus uptake. These results indicate that both the HA and the NA <b>induce</b> <b>antibodies</b> that enhance uptake of virus by Fc receptor bearing cells. In addition we determined that the drift of neutralizing antigens occurred more quickly than the drift of infection-enhancing antigens during the evolution of virus strains of the H 3 subtype.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that {{chemically}} synthesized small peptides can <b>induce</b> <b>antibodies</b> that often react with intact proteins regardless of their position in the folded molecule. These findings are difficult to explain in view of the experimental and theoretical data which suggest that in the absence of forces provided by the folded protein, small peptides in aqueous solution do not readily adopt stable structures. In order to rationalize the two findings, there has been general acceptance of a stochastic model which suggests that the multiple conformers of a peptide in solution induce sets of antibodies with a small percentage reactive with conformations shared by the folded protein. This stochastic model has become less tenable as the success rate for the generation of protein-reactive anti-peptide antibodies has grown. To test the stochastic model, we have used monoclonal anti-peptide antibodies as a way of estimating the frequency with which small peptides <b>induce</b> <b>antibodies</b> that react with folded proteins. We have made monoclonal antibodies to six chemically synthesized peptides from three proteins. The frequency with which the peptides induce protein-reactive antibodies is at least 4 orders of magnitude greater than expected from previous experimental work and vastly different from what would be predicted by calculating the possible number of peptide conformers in solution. These findings make the stochastic model less likely and lead to consideration of other models. Aside from their practical significance for generation of highly specific reagents, these findings may have important implications for the protein folding problem...|$|E
