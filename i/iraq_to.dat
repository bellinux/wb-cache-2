5|$|After {{his failure}} at Constantinople, Maslama was {{dispatched}} to <b>Iraq</b> <b>to</b> quell the Kharijites. Following Umar's {{death and the}} accession of his brother Yazid II in 720, he was tasked with {{the suppression of the}} revolt of Yazid ibn al-Muhallab, whom he defeated and killed in August 720. He nevertheless fell out of favour with the Caliph, who resented and feared his power as governor of both Iraqs, as well as his interfering in the succession: Maslama favoured his brother Hisham over Yazid's son Walid. Yazid soon recalled Maslama from his post, ostensibly because he had failed to deliver his provinces' tax haul to Damascus, and replaced him by his protege, Umar ibn Hubayra.|$|E

He released a statement {{on the campaign trail}} that expressed his belief that Bush was right to enact the sanctions. However, Biden argued that it was not enough, calling for a No-Fly Zone over the region and a possible commitment of United States forces to the nation.|$|E

In 1953 Shishakli launched a crackdown on the Druze community, claiming they were being funded by Hashemite-ruled Jordan and <b>Iraq</b> <b>to</b> establish a Hashemite government in Syria.

5|$|In June 2014 a {{small number}} of SASR {{personnel}} were deployed to <b>Iraq</b> <b>to</b> protect the Australian embassy when the security of Baghdad was threatened by the 2014 Northern Iraq offensive. Later, in August and September a number of RAAF C-17 and C-130J transport aircraft based in the Middle East were used to conduct airdrops of humanitarian aid to trapped civilians and to airlift arms and munitions to forces in Kurdish-controlled northern Iraq. In late September 2014 an Air Task Group (ATG) and Special Operations Task Group (SOTG) were deployed to Al Minhad Air Base in the United Arab Emirates as part of the coalition to combat Islamic State forces in Iraq. Equipped with F/A-18F Super Hornet strike aircraft, a KC-30A Multi Role Tanker Transport, and an E-7A Wedgetail Airborne Early Warning & Control aircraft, the ATG began operations on 1 October. The SOTG is tasked with operations to advise and assist Iraqi Security Forces, and was deployed to Iraq after a legal framework covering their presence in the country was agreed between the Australian and Iraqi Governments. It began moving into Iraq in early November. In April 2015 a 300-strong unit known as Task Group Taji was deployed to <b>Iraq</b> <b>to</b> train the regular Iraqi Security Forces. Airstrikes were extended to Syria in September 2015.|$|E
5|$|In his {{writings}} Aflaq had been stridently {{in favor of}} free speech and other human rights and aid for the lower classes. During the Military Committee's gradual take over of power in Syria, Aflaq rallied against {{what he saw as}} the establishment of a military dictatorship, instead of the democracy for which Aflaq had planned. These ideals were never realized by the governments that used his ideology. Most scholars see the Assad government in Syria and Saddam Hussein's government in <b>Iraq</b> <b>to</b> have only employed Aflaq's ideology as a pretense for dictatorship.|$|E

SECDET was finally withdrawn in August 2011, {{and was replaced by}} a private military company which took over responsibility for providing security for Australia's diplomatic presence in Iraq. Although more than 17,000 personnel served during operations in Iraq, Australian casualties were relatively light, with two soldiers accidentally killed, while a third Australian died serving with the British Royal Air Force. A further 27 personnel were wounded. Two officers remained in Iraq attached to the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq as part of Operation Riverbank.

Buster and Michael travel to <b>Iraq</b> <b>to</b> rescue Gob, and while there, uncover evidence that the mini-palaces George Sr. built in Iraq were actually ordered and {{paid for by the}} CIA for wiretapping purposes.

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Tzemah, the Haganah command {{realized}} {{the importance of the}} campaign in the region, and made a clear separation between the Kinarot Valley, and the Battle of Gesher fought against Transjordan and <b>Iraq</b> <b>to</b> the south. On May 18, Moshe Dayan, who had been born in Degania, was given command of all forces in the area, after having been charged with creating a commando battalion in the 8th Brigade just a day before. A company of reinforcements from the Gadna program was allocated, along with 3 PIATs. Other reinforcements {{came in the form of}} a company from the Yiftach Brigade and another company of paramilitaries from villages in the Lower Galilee and the Jezreel Valley. The Palmach counterattack on the police station on the night of May 18 gave the Israeli forces an additional day to prepare defense and attack plans.|$|E

5|$|At 10:20, Wickson, the F-15C flight lead, {{reported}} entering northern <b>Iraq</b> <b>to</b> the AWACS controller {{responsible for}} air traffic inside the TAOR, USAF Lieutenant Ricky Wilson. The TAOR frequency that the F-15s were using {{was different from}} the en-route frequency being used by the two Black Hawks. Wilson, however, was monitoring both frequencies and being able to see both Black Hawks on his radar scope before they disappeared at 10:12. Wilson and the other AWACS crew members, many of whom were monitoring the F-15s' radio frequency, did not inform the F-15s that Black Hawks were currently operating in the TAOR. At 10:21, Wilson, believing that the Black Hawks had landed again, asked Wang if he could drop the friendly helicopter symbols from the AWACS's scopes and Wang approved the request. An AWACS crew instructor, Captain Mark Cathy, who was on the mission to assist the AWACS crew and supervise Wilson on this, his first mission into the TAOR, had retired {{to the back of the}} airplane at 10:00 to take a nap.|$|E
5|$|At {{the launch}} of the Iraq War dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams {{infiltrated}} southern and western <b>Iraq</b> <b>to</b> hunt for Scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast. Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It {{was a far cry from}} the Persian Gulf war of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. But it would not be a replay of Afghanistan, where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders. From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and Al-Qaeda terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training the Iraqi security forces.|$|E
5|$|Darwaza {{was one of}} the {{principal}} organizers of the 1936â€“39 Arab revolt in Palestine which first erupted in his hometown of Nablus with the launch of the Palestinian general strike. Along with Abd al-Hadi, Darwaza was arrested by the British authorities in June and imprisoned in the military camp at Sarafand al-Amar. The Mufti sent a delegation consisting of Darwaza, Mu'in al-Madi, and Abd al-Hadi to Baghdad, then to Riyadh to discuss the situation and upon their return on 6 January 1937, they revealed that the advice given to them was to cease hostilities. During the revolt, in 1937, Darwaza was exiled from Palestine by British authorities to Damascus. Later in that year, Darwaza held several meetings with Nuri al-Sa'id of <b>Iraq</b> <b>to</b> explore various solutions to help the Arabs avoid appearing intransigent.|$|E
