30|$|The {{clustered}} regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-associated (Cas) {{system is}} an {{adaptive immune system}} {{in a variety of}} bacteria and archaea (Terns and Terns, 2011). The most commonly used Streptococcus pyogenes type II CRISPR-Cas 9 system consists of Cas 9 nuclease and two short RNAs, crRNA and tracrRNA, which can be linked together forming one chimeric single guide RNA (sgRNA) (Jinek et al., 2012). Guided by sgRNA, Cas 9 -sgRNA complex can generate DNA double strand breaks (DSB) at specific genomic loci (Jinek et al., 2012; Cong et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013). Cas 9 with mutations at the catalytic RuvC and HNH domains loses the endonuclease activity (indicated “dCas 9 ”), while maintains its DNA binding capability (Gilbert et al., 2013).

To that end we offer insights into the nature and mechanics of foreign bond issuance by investigating the key characteristics of 3, 132 foreign bonds issued in 14 countries (other than the United States) between July 1928 and June 2009. We found that the foreign borrowers that tap domestic markets are overwhelmingly of high credit quality and comprise sovereigns, supranationals, and major financial institutions. There is a preference for simple fixed-rate payment structures, which can then be swapped into the currency and coupon type of choice using currency and interest rate derivatives.

40|$|BK {{channels}} are critical regulators of neuronal activity, controlling firing, neurotransmitter release, cerebellar function, and BK channel mutations {{have been linked}} to seizure disorders. Modulation of BK channel gating is well characterized, regulated by accessory subunit interactions, intracellular signaling pathways, and membrane potential. In contrast, the role of intracellular trafficking mechanisms in controlling BK channel function, especially in live cells, has been less studied. Fluorogen-activating peptides (FAPs) are well-suited for trafficking and physiological studies due to the binding of malachite green (MG) -based dyes with sub-nanomolar affinity to the FAP, resulting in bright, photostable, far-red fluorescence. Cell-excluded MG dyes enable the selective tagging of surface protein and tracking through endocytic pathways. We used CRISPR to insert the FAP at the extracellular N-terminus of BKα in the first exon of its native locus, <b>enabling</b> <b>regulation</b> by the native promoter elements and tag incorporation into multiple splice isoforms. Motor coordination was found to be normal; however, BK channel expression seems to be reduced in some locations. Alternate start site selection or post-translational proteolytic processing resulted in incomplete FAP tagging of the BKα proteins in brain tissues. In Purkinje cell somata, FAP revealed BK channel clustering previously only observed by electron microscopy. Measurement of these clusters in β 4 +/- and β 4 -/- mice showed that puncta number and cluster fluorescence intensity on the soma are reduced in β 4 -/- knockout animals.

40|$|Streptomyces hygroscopicus var. geldanus, an actinomycete, {{produces}} {{a range of}} antibiotic compounds, one of which, Geldanamycin, is currently under investigation for its potential anticancer properties. Filamentous microbes, both bacterial and fungal, possess the ability to grow {{in a range of}} morphological forms in submerged fermentations. Secondary metabolite production by filamentous microorganisms is often dependent on the morphology of biomass aggregates within the culture and therefore morphological regulation in such fermentations is desirable in order to produce specific compounds of interest. Morphological assessment of pellet formation and growth necessitated the development of an image analysis technique to allow high throughput morphological characterisation of microbial fermentation broths. An assessment of environmental and nutritional conditions for culturing S. hygroscopicus, concentrating specifically on the impact of nutrient broth composition, spore loading density and shear rate on the morphological and physiological profiles of the organism, was undertaken. The formation of pelleted biomass in submerged fermentations occurs as a result of spore aggregation, hyphal aggregation or entanglement; each of which was identified as a potential morphological control strategy. The microbial polysaccharide xanthan gum was used to artificially regulate the apparent viscosity and hence the rheological characteristics of S. hygroscopicus fermentations broths and succeeded in controlling particle collision, aggregation and hence pellet formation. Control of broth surface tension through the introduction of surfactants, facilitates regulation of hydrophobic particle interaction, thus <b>enabling</b> <b>regulation</b> of hyphal aggregation and hence pellet formation in S. hygroscopicus cultures.

40|$|CBS domains are ~ 60 {{amino acid}} tandemly {{repeated}} regulatory modules forming a widely distributed domain superfamily. Found {{in thousands of}} proteins from all kingdoms of life, CBS domains have adopted a variety of functions during evolution, {{one of which is}} regulation of enzyme activity through binding of adenylate-containing compounds in a hydrophobic cavity. Mutations in human CBS domain-containing proteins cause hereditary diseases. Inorganic pyrophosphatases (PPases) are ubiquitous enzymes, which pull pyrophosphate (PPi) producing reactions forward by hydrolyzing PPi into phosphate. Of the two nonhomologous soluble PPases, dimeric family II PPases, belonging to the DHH family of phosphoesterases, require a transition metal and magnesium for maximal activity. A quarter of the almost 500 family II PPases, found in bacteria and archaea, contain a 120 - 250 amino acid N-terminal insertion, comprised of two CBS domains separated in sequence by a DRTGG domain. These enzymes are thus named CBS-PPases. The function of the DRTGG domain in proteins is unknown. The aim of this PhD thesis was to elucidate the structural and functional differences of CBS-PPases in comparison to family II PPases lacking the regulatory insert. To this end, we expressed, purified and characterized the CBS-PPases from Clostridium perfringens (cp CBS-PPase) and Moorella thermoacetica (mt CBS-PPase), the latter lacking a DRTGG domain. Both enzymes are homodimers in solution and display maximal activity against PPi in the presence of Co 2 + and Mg 2 +. Uniquely, the DRTGG domain was found to enable tripolyphosphate hydrolysis at rates similar to that of PPi. Additionally, we found that AMP and ADP inhibit, while ATP and AP 4 A activate CBSPPases, thus <b>enabling</b> <b>regulation</b> in response to changes in cellular energy status. We then observed substrate- and nucleotide-induced conformational transitions in mt CBS-PPase and found that the enzyme exists in two differentially active conformations, interconverted through substrate binding and resulting in a 2. 5 -fold enzyme activation. AMP binding was shown to produce an alternate conformation, which is reached through a different pathway than the substrate-induced conformation. We solved the structure of the regulatory insert from cp CBS-PPase in complex with AMP and AP 4 A and proposed that conformational changes in the loops connecting the catalytic and regulatory domains enable activity regulation. We examined the effects of mutations in the CBS domains of mt CBS-PPase on catalytic activity, as well as, nucleotide binding and inhibition...|$|E
40|$|Epigenetic {{regulation}} {{is a complex}} biological process that has influence {{on the structure of}} chromatin and impacts on the regulation of DNA-associated events, including transcription, DNA replication, and DNA damage repair. Post-translational modifications (PTMs) to the tails of the core histone proteins are critically involved in epigenetic regulation. The JmjC domain-containing histone demethylases play important roles in the regulation of chromatin structure and consequently gene regulation and biological events. The first aspect of my work was to explore the application of fission yeast to investigating human JmjC histone demethylase (KDM) function. The work focused on the human KDM 4 A and FBXL 11 demethylases and investigation on the role of H 3 K 36 modifications in the survival of wee 1 mutant S. pombe. The roles of the JmjC domain function of KDM 4 A and FBXL 11 were also investigated. The results reveal KDM 4 A mediated demethylation of histone H 3 K 36 me 3 /me 2 has synthetic lethality with respect to wee 1 mutant S. pombe, whereas FBXL 11 mediated demethylation of histone H 3 K 36 me 2 has more subtle effects. Work on epigenetics is often limited by antibody properties. In the second and third parts of the work described in this thesis, mass spectrometric methods that are capable of histone profiling are described, with the aim of developing methods complementary to immunoblotting. An LC-MS-based method for profiling histones was developed and used for analysis of histone modification under different conditions. Using the high resolution of LC and MS instruments, this method provides robust analysis of modifications to intact histones. Histone profiles for human normal and cancer cell lines were investigated. Subsequently, the method was applied to analyse global changes in histone modification patterns under various conditions, focusing on hypoxia/ hypoxia related stresses. Hypoxia has effects on the activity of JmjC KDMs and the hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) isoforms levels, so <b>enabling</b> <b>regulation</b> of expression. The effects of 2 OG/Fe(II) oxygenase inhibitors of enzymes involved in hypoxic regulation on histone PTM patterns were also investigated. The results reveal that the extent to which hypoxia and hypoxia-mimetics (including inhibition that upregulate HIF-α levels) cause changes to histone profiles vary differently. The LC-MS-based method hence has potential application in drug discovery and in investigations on the role of histone modifications in healthy development and disease. </p...|$|E

40|$|The United States {{government}} {{enacted the}} Banking Act of 1933, {{commonly known as}} the Glass-Steagall Act, at least partially in an effort to calm fears stemming from bank failures during the Great Depression. While there has been a recent debate concerning the historic realism of characterizing the banking industry structure as the cause of the financial crisis (Benston, 1990), the perception of bank activities in the financial market as risky (Puri, 1994), and the motivation of the legislators (Benston, 1996), the historical outcome of this legislation is clear. Glass-Steagall placed a heavy regulatory burden on commercial banks by limiting their product array, the prices they could charge, and the types of firms with whom they may affiliate. It short, it restricted the activities in which banks may participate. During the ensuing sixty-five years, this landmark piece of regulation slowly has become both outdated and untenable. Technological innovation, regulatory circumvention, and new delivery mechanisms all have conspired to make the restrictions of the Act increasingly irrelevant. The first force of change, technology, permitted firms to create and recreate products and services in different ways than had been envisioned decades ago. The most obvious example is the transformation of the local mortgage loan market into the global securities giant of today. However, one could equally cite the explosive growth of both derivatives and trading activity as areas where technology has transformed the very core of financial services (Allen and Santomero, 1997). Because of regulation, however, individual financial firms were still limited in the scope of the activities that was permissible. Commercial banks could not offer the full range of security investment services; investment firms could not offer demand deposits; and, insurance firms were limited in offering services beyond their own "appropriate" products as well. Many firms responded by circumventing regulation, either explicitly or implicitly (Kane, 1999, Kaufman, 1996). Some more aggressive members of the fraternity simply acted in a manner not allowed by regulation in hopes of either an innovative interpretation of the law, e. g., NOW accounts, or money funds, or formal regulatory relief, e. g., Citigroup. The results were, almost always, regulatory accommodation or capitulation. These decisions, at times, made economic sense, e. g., the decisions on private placement activity, or advisory services, but at other times they stretched the credibility of the rules, if not the English language, e. g., non-bank banks, the facilitation of commercial paper placement, and mutual funds distribution. Yet, through this mechanism of regulatory evolution the industry progressed. Banks were granted greater latitude in product mix, as well as permitted to form holding companies that expanded their operations further. At the same time, competition increased as the rules permitted new entrants who flourished in focused areas, e. g., GE Capital. Today, a myriad of financial services firms, operating under different regulatory charters are competing in the broad financial marketplace. The final force of change is the continual evolution of the delivery channels through which financial services are offered. This has occurred in many ways and in several stages. First, the use of postal services substituted for physical market presence; this was followed by increased use of telephones for both customer service and outbound marketing; and now, personal computers and the web have altered the very balance of the financial industry. Throughout this period the application of technology has disrupted the industry's delivery paradigms and the traditional channels of service distribution. The combined use of new technology, conduits of distribution, and financial innovation have broadened the product offerings of all firms beyond their historic core business. Nonetheless, by law, financial service firms of specific types continued to be expressly limited in their activities. Finally, the Financial Modernization Act of 1999 (FMA), introduced on January 6, 1999 in the House of Representatives as H. R. 10, has become law under the name the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act. The bill's stated purpose was "[t]o enhance competition in the financial services industry by providing a prudential framework for the affiliation of banks, securities firms, and other financial service providers, and for other purposes. " The potential ramifications of FMA have been, and surely will be, continuously analyzed as the details of the <b>enabling</b> <b>regulation</b> emerge and the industry responds to its new perspective on firm structure and allowable activity (ABA, 1999, Stein and Perrino, 2000). Yet, the proponents of the FMA have already heralded its passage and argued that the legislation will result in more competitive, stable, and efficient financial firms, and a better overall capital market (Greenspan, 1997). Detractors, and there have been some, claim the new law will result in unfair business practices and less stable capital markets (Berger and Udell, 1996). In this contribution to the debate we attempt to consolidate many of the arguments for and against the financial conglomeration that will inevitably follow the passage of the new law. We offer our view of the effects of this new competitive landscape on affected financial firms, as well as the behavior of the capital market itself. Our focus is on the impact of the changing nature of both the market infrastructure and the regulatory regime on the behavior and likely span of activity conducted by large financial firms. In the words of our title: now that firms can do everything, what should they do, and why should regulators care?...|$|E
