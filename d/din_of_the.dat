25|$|At the 1998 Jerusalem Agunot Conference, Rabbi Mayer Rabinowitz, the Chairman of the Joint Bet <b>Din</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Conservative Movement, {{explained}} the four approaches taken by leaders of Conservative Judaism to find remedies {{for the problem}} of the agunah.|$|E
25|$|Other Bnei Brak leaders, {{including}} Rabbi Chaim Shaul Karelitz, {{the former}} av bet <b>din</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> She'erit Yisrael Kashrut organization of Bnei Brak, Rabbi Yaakov Weinberg, a rosh yeshiva of Yeshivas Ner Yisroel, have also all spoken negatively {{of those who}} wish Schneerson would be the Messiah.|$|E
25|$|Finally, in 1968, by a {{unanimous}} {{vote of the}} law committee, the final approach was initiated, when {{it was decided that}} the Joint Bet <b>Din</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Conservative Movement could annul marriages as a last resort, based on the Talmudic principle of hafka'at kiddushin. According to Rabinowitz, just the threat of this action was sometimes enough to compel the former husband to grant a get.|$|E

His {{maternal}} grandfather was Rabbi Yosef Cohen, <b>the</b> av beit <b>din</b> <b>of</b> Eschwege, Germany.|$|R
25|$|In the Conservative {{movement}} {{a traditional}} get is required. However, {{in cases where}} the husband refuses to grant the get and the Bet Din (Rabbinic Court) has ruled that the husband's refusal is not justified, the marital condition may be terminated by hafqa'at kiddushin, or annulment of the marriage. This requires a majority vote of the Joint Bet <b>Din</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> movement, which is made up of nine rabbinic scholars. Upon their authorization of the process, the Bet Din may issue a certificate of annulment. This protocol is viewed as extreme and is invoked only in cases of dire necessity.|$|E
25|$|Rabbi Sholom Rivkin (6 June 1926 – 1 October 2011) was an Israeli-born American rabbi. He was {{the last}} Chief Rabbi of St. Louis, Missouri, and the last chief rabbi of {{one of only a}} few cities in the United States that has ever had a chief rabbi. He held the post of Chief Rabbi from 1983 until 2005 and was Chief Rabbi Emeritus until his death in 2011. He was also a chief judge on the Beth <b>Din</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rabbinical Council of America, and head of the Vaad Hoeir of St. Louis, the {{governing}} body of the St. Louis Orthodox Jewish community. He was an expert in Jewish law, especially family and divorce law, and was consulted by rabbis and rabbinical courts around the world.|$|E
25|$|While Khan {{was away}} from Mangalgarh, Mohammad Farooq Hakim, the Governor of Bhilsa, imprisoned his men and confiscated his {{personal}} property. When Khan returned and confronted him, {{he said that he}} believed that Khan had died in the battle with the Mughals. He released the imprisoned men, but returned only half of the Khan's belongings. The resulting hostility eventually led to a battle near Bhilsa. Farooq's army included 40,000 Maratha and Rajput soldiers, while Khan commanded just 5000 Afghans, supported by some Rajput soldiers. In a one-sided battle, Khan lost his brother Sher Mohammed Khan, and his men fled from the battlefield. Dost Mohammad Khan, with some of his most loyal men, had to hide in a thicket near the battlefield. As he lay hidden, he saw Farooq riding an elephant in the victory procession. He dressed himself in the uniform of one of Farooq's slain soldiers, hiding his face with a scarf and a helmet. Amid the <b>din</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> victory drums, he mounted the howdah (seat) on the elephant, killed Farooq and his guard, and claimed victory.|$|E

500|$|The assault troops rose {{early on}} 3 January 1941, ate a meal and drank a tot of rum. The leading {{companies}} began {{moving to the}} start line at 0416. The artillery opened fire at 0530. On crossing the start line the 2/1st Infantry Battalion, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth Eather, came under Italian mortar and artillery fire. The lead platoons advanced accompanied by sappers of the 2/1st Field Company carrying Bangalore torpedoes— pipes packed with ammonal—as Italian artillery fire began to land, mainly behind them. An Italian shell exploded among a leading platoon and detonated a Bangalore torpedo, resulting in four killed and nine wounded. The torpedoes were slid under the barbed wire at [...] intervals. A whistle was blown as a signal to detonate the torpedoes but could not be heard over the <b>din</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> barrage. Colonel Eather became anxious and ordered the engineering party nearest him to detonate their torpedo. This the other teams heard, and they followed suit.|$|E
500|$|Following {{their failure}} to advance the radical agenda in Louisville, Trotter and the other {{radicals}} sought a more sympathetic forum in which to attack Booker T. Washington. An opportunity arrived when Washington was set to speak in Boston in July 1903. When the Tuskegee Institute leader was introduced to a visibly hostile crowd, a small riot broke out. Trotter, who had arrived prepared with several provocative questions to ask Washington, attempted to read them over the <b>din</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> melee. He was among the arrested, and the [...] "Boston riot" [...] received national press coverage. [...] Trotter later claimed {{that there was no}} plan to break up the meeting. Bookerites pressed charges against Trotter for disrupting the meeting; defended by Archibald Grimké, Trotter was convicted and spent thirty days in the Charles Street Jail. Although the Bookerites had hoped to discredit the radicals with the trial, they gained them wider publicity. After the trial, Trotter founded the Boston Suffrage League (1903), and when a New England Suffrage League was founded in 1904, Trotter was elected president.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{forms of}} the story are highly unlikely; the most {{widespread}} is that he shouted to Brooklyn, [...] "Damn the torpedoes! Go ahead!" [...] Men present at the battle doubted that any such verbal communication could be heard above the <b>din</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> guns. More likely, if it happened, is that {{he said to the}} captain of Hartford, [...] "Damn the torpedoes. Four bells, Captain Drayton." [...] Then he shouted to the commander of Metacomet, lashed to Hartfords side, [...] "Go ahead, Jouett, full speed." [...] The words have been altered in time to the more familiar, [...] "Damn the torpedoes, full speed ahead!" ...|$|E
2500|$|It is {{the duty}} of the father to have his child circumcised; and if he fails in this, the beth <b>din</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city must see that the rite is performed. According to {{traditional}} Jewish law, {{in the absence of a}} grown free Jewish male expert, a woman, a slave, or a child, that has the required skills, is also authorized to perform the circumcision, provided that she or he is Jewish. However, most streams of non-Orthodox Judaism allow female mohels, called mohalot ( [...] , plural of [...] mohelet, feminine of mohel), without restriction. In 1984, Dr. Deborah Cohen became the first certified Reform mohelet; she was certified by the Berit Mila program of Reform Judaism.|$|E

2500|$|Rapoport {{has written}} about {{homosexuality}} from an Orthodox perspective.

The book's forward was written by the then Chief Rabbi, Jonathan Sacks who described Rapoport as [...] "a courageous figure who has written on a difficult subject that many would rather avoid". The book stakes out a position on Homosexuality and Judaism designed [...] "to mitigate the painful consequences of Orthodoxy's uncompromising rejection of homosexuality.", exploring the intersection between halakhah and homosexuality.|$|E
2500|$|A Scandinavian folk {{belief that}} {{lightning}} frightens away trolls and jötnar appears in numerous Scandinavian folktales, {{and may be}} a late reflection of the god Thor's role in fighting such beings. In connection, the lack of trolls and jötnar in modern Scandinavia is sometimes explained {{as a result of}} the [...] "accuracy and efficiency of the lightning strokes". Additionally, the absence of trolls in regions of Scandinavia are described in folklore as being a [...] "consequence of the constant <b>din</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> church-bells". This ring caused the trolls to leave for other lands, although not without some resistance; numerous traditions relate how trolls destroyed a church under construction or hurled boulders and stones at completed churches. Large local stones are sometimes described as the product of a troll's toss. Additionally, into the 20th century, the origins of particular Scandinavian landmarks, such as particular stones, are ascribed to trolls who may, for example, have turned to stone upon exposure to sunlight.|$|E
