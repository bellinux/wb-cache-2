25|$|In May 1997, the Labour Party won a {{landslide}} general election victory, {{the largest in}} its history, allowing Blair, at 43 years of age, to become the youngest Prime Minister since 1812. In September 1997, Blair attained early personal popularity, receiving a 93% public approval rating, after his public response {{to the death of}} Diana, Princess of Wales. The Labour Party went on to win two more general elections under his leadership: in 2001, in which it won another landslide victory, and in 2005, with a greatly reduced majority. During his first term as Prime Minister, his government oversaw a large increase in public spending and introduced the National Minimum Wage Act, Human Rights Act, and Freedom of Information Act. His government also held referenda in which the Scottish and Welsh electorates voted in favour of <b>devolved</b> <b>administration.</b> In Northern Ireland, Blair was involved in negotiating the Good Friday Agreement.|$|E
2500|$|... 19th century {{violent and}} {{constitutional}} campaigns for autonomy or independence culminated {{in an election}} in 1918 returning almost 70% of seats to Sinn Féin, who declared Irish independence from Britain {{and set up a}} parliament in Dublin, and declared the independence of Ireland from the United Kingdom. A war of independence followed that ended with the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1922, which partitioned Ireland between the Irish Free State, which gained dominion status within the British Empire, and a <b>devolved</b> <b>administration</b> in Northern Ireland, which remained part of the UK. In 1937, Ireland declared itself fully independent of the United Kingdom.|$|E

50|$|Northern Ireland, Scotland & Wales enjoy {{different}} levels of legislative, administrative and budgetary autonomy. The table shows the areas and degree of autonomy and budgetary independence. Exclusive means that the <b>devolved</b> <b>administration</b> has exclusive powers in this policy area.

50|$|There are two non-ministerial {{departments}} that {{form part of}} the Scottish administration, and therefore the <b>devolved</b> <b>administration,</b> but answer directly to the Scottish Parliament rather than to ministers: these are the General Register Office for Scotland and the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator.|$|E

However, the <b>devolved</b> <b>administrations</b> also maintain an overseas presence in the European Union, the USA and China alongside British diplomatic missions. These offices aim to promote their regional economies and ensure that devolved interests are taken into account in British foreign policy.

50|$|In their {{manifesto}} for the 2007 election, the Scottish National Party (SNP) {{proposed the}} Scottish Futures Trust {{as an alternative}} to PPP/PFI, encouraging greater use of public bonds, to access to lower-cost borrowing.

50|$|Due to the devolved {{nature of}} the United Kingdom, {{responsibility}} for managing statistical geographies often falls to the National Statistical Institute with jurisdiction for that <b>devolved</b> <b>administration.</b> For England and Wales this is the Office for National Statistics, for Scotland National Records of Scotland and for Northern Ireland the Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency.|$|E

50|$|SPIDER's cluster system {{provides}} an extra level of hierarchy {{that allows for}} <b>devolved</b> <b>administration</b> by allocating each class to a department within a cluster.

5000|$|In <b>devolved</b> <b>administrations,</b> {{the powers}} {{currently}} exercised by the EU {{in relation to}} common policy frameworks {{would return to the}} UK, allowing the rules to be set in the UK by democratically-elected representatives. Ministers of <b>devolved</b> <b>administrations</b> would be given the power to amend devolved legislation to correct law that would not operate appropriately following Brexit. However, the bill also prevents <b>devolved</b> <b>administrations</b> from making changes that are [...] "inconsistent" [...] with those made by the UK government. This significantly limits the power of the devolved governments by making it impossible for them to, for example, choose to retain a piece of EU law that has been modified by the UK government. The First Ministers of Scotland and Wales, Nicola Sturgeon and Carwyn Jones, issued a joint statement calling the bill a [...] "naked power grab" [...] and threatening to withhold Legislative Consent Motions unless the bill was redrafted.|$|R
50|$|The Welsh Government also {{includes}} a civil service that supports the Welsh ministers. According to a report from 2014, there are over 5,000 civil servants working across Wales.

50|$|Scottish Government also {{includes}} a civil service that supports the Scottish ministers. According to 2012 reports, there are 16,000 civil servants working in core Scottish Government directorates and agencies.
