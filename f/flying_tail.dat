6000|$|Any spectator {{observing the}} {{performance}} of this feat of strength, and looking only at Mat, might well have thought it impossible that any human being could present a more comical aspect than he now exhibited, with his black skull-cap pushed a little on one side, and showing {{an inch or so}} of his bald head, with his grimly-grinning face empurpled by the violent physical exertion of the moment, and with his thick heavy figure ridiculously perched on one leg. Mr. Blyth, however, was beyond all comparison the more laughable object of the two, as he soared nervously into the air on Mat's foot, tottering infirmly in the strong grasp that supported him, till he seemed to be trembling all over, from the tips of his crisp black hair to the <b>flying</b> <b>tails</b> of his frock-coat. As for the expression of his round rosy face, with the bright eyes fixed in a startled stare, and the plump cheeks crumpled up by an uneasy smile, it was so exquisitely absurd, as young Thorpe saw it over his fellow-lodger's black skull-cap, that he roared again with laughter.

50|$|Drawing {{from the}} {{experience}} with his previous design, the Jeanie's Teenie, Calvin Parker set out to refine the popular airplane. Improvements on the Jeanie's Teenie included adoption of a fixed horizontal stabilizer, over the all <b>flying</b> <b>tail</b> of the former machine. The aft fuselage was smoothed to follow {{a straight line from}} the cockpit to the tail, an aesthetic change that replaced the older plane's bent back appearance. Fuel capacity was increased as was horsepower, resulting in a heavier but faster airplane. Brakes were added as a requirement, as the lighter Jeanie's Teenie could get by without them. The end product was a smoother, streamlined appearance and better handling. The new airplane was named Teenie Two.|$|E
50|$|As regards his {{preferences}} Brown states:My favourite in {{the piston}} engine (era) is the de Havilland Hornet. For {{the simple reason}} it was over-powered. This is an unusual feature in an aircraft, you could do anything on one engine, almost, {{that you could do}} on two. It was a 'hot rod Mosquito' really, I always described it as like flying a Ferrari in the sky.On the jet side I was a great admirer of the F-86 Sabre, but in particular, the Model E (F-86E) which had the <b>flying</b> <b>tail,</b> and this gave me what I call the 'perfect harmony of control'. If a pilot has this perfect harmony of control you feel you're part of the aeroplane and you're bonded with it really. You've got into it and the aeroplane welcomes you and says 'thank God you've come, you're part of me anyway' and to fly like that is a sheer delight.|$|E
5000|$|The 711 Blue was {{demonstrated}} {{to the press}} at Zhukovsky in spring 1996, by which time it was re-designated Su-37. Its debut {{to the general public}} came in September that year at the Farnborough Airshow, piloted by Sukhoi test pilot Yevgeni Frolov. A big talking point of the show was its performance of the [...] "Super Cobra", when the aircraft pitched up to 180°, literally <b>flying</b> <b>tail</b> first, albeit for only a few seconds; this maneuver evolved into the 360° [...] "Frolov Chakra" [...] somersault. The following year, the aircraft arrived on the fifth and last day of the Paris Air Show to perform five aerial displays, the fourth of which was marred by a minor incident when the emergency undercarriage extension handle was moved, preventing gear retraction. It appeared at that year's Moscow International Aviation and Space Show and Dubai International Defence Exhibition, as well as the 1998 FIDAE air show in Chile; for the latter two the Su-37 appeared under the enigmatic designation, [...] "Su-37MR".|$|E
50|$|The Lerche was {{an early}} {{coleopter}} design. It would take off and land sitting on its <b>tail,</b> <b>flying</b> horizontally like a conventional aircraft.

50|$|On 30 September 1899, having {{completed}} his triplane, {{he had intended}} to demonstrate it {{to a group of}} onlookers and potential sponsors in a field near Stanford Hall.

50|$|On 16 October 1908 the British Army Aeroplane No 1, {{flown by}} the American Samuel Franklin Cody, {{was the first}} {{aircraft}} flown in the UK, at Farnborough; on 14 May 1909 he flew {{it for more than}} a mile. On 13 August 1909, his wife would be the first woman in the UK to fly in a plane, also at Farnborough. The first Harrier aircraft XV738 flew on 28 December 1967; this was the first aircraft of the RAF to have a head-up display avionics system. The first two-seat Harrier XW174 flew on 24 April 1969, later crashing at Larkhill in June 1969. The British Aerospace Sea Harrier XZ450 first flew on 20 August 1978; on 4 May 1982 this aircraft would be hit by anti-aircraft fire at Goose Green, killing the pilot with 800 Naval Air Squadron from HMS Hermes; the aircraft had no radar warning receiver (RWR), due to testing the Sea Eagle, so could not detect the Skyguard radar had locked on to it, being destroyed with the Oerlikon GDF (35mm) of GADA 601; it was the first Sea Harrier lost in the Falklands campaign. The first manned airborne ejection seat firing took place on 24 July 1946 over Chalgrove Airfield, Oxfordshire, in a Meteor, piloted by Bernard Lynch; the first dummy ejection had been 10 May 1945 over RAF Oakley in west Buckinghamshire (today near the M40); on 13 March 1962, the first in-flight rocket-powered ejection took place by Peter Howard, an RAF doctor based at Farnborough's Institute of Aviation Medicine in Meteor WA364 at 250 ft over Chalgrove, with the rocket giving a maximum force of 16G. The Miles M.52, designed at Woodley Aerodrome in Berkshire by Miles Aircraft, was an advanced design of aircraft which had the innovation of the <b>flying</b> <b>tail</b> or all-moving tail also known as a stabilator; this would solve the problem of stability and aircraft control at supersonic speeds, and its design was taken wholesale into the American Bell X-1, the first supersonic aircraft.|$|E
