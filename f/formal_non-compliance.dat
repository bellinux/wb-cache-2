40|$|A {{security}} policy {{which includes the}} appropriate phases of implementation, enforcement, auditing and review is vital to protecting an organisations information security. This paper examined the information {{security policy}} of a government organisation {{in response to a}} number of perceived shortcomings. The specific issues identified relating to the organisations security policy {{as a result of this}} investigation were as follows: a culture of ignoring policies, minimal awareness of policies, minimal policy enforcement, policy updating and review ad hoc at best, policy framework, lengthy policy development and approval process, no compliance program, no <b>formal</b> <b>non-compliance</b> reporting and an apparent inconsistent enforcement across the whole of the organisation. In response to these identified issues, the following recommendations were made to improve the information security of the organisation: changing the organisations culture, creating an awareness mechanism for policies, improving the organisations culture, create an ICT policy awareness programme, review and re-write existing policies, policy enforcement, policy compliance, policy noncompliance reporting, policy updating and review, improve the policy development and approval process, policy compliance checking and uniform policy enforcement. Whilst it is also likely that a lack of governance contributed to these issues, this aspect was not addressed in this paper. It is hoped that timely implementation of the remedies presented here will increase the organisations information security...|$|E
40|$|The WTO dispute {{resolution}} body (DSB) is coming under increasing strain because some member states that lose cases, often the WTO’s wealthiest members, fail to fully implement the dispute panel rulings. On August 21, Brazil formally requested a WTO dispute panel because the U. S. {{has not made}} all the changes to its cotton programs that the dispute ruling of June 2004 on U. S. Upland Cotton required. The case is not unique. Non-compliance undermines the credibility and viability of the WTO’s rules-based multilateral trading system. In {{the wake of the}} July 2006 collapse of the Doha Round negotiations, many experts believe there will be a significant rise in WTO legal disputes. IATP proposes developing countries consider using a new strategy to ensure compliance: cross-retaliation within the WTO system. Under this approach, winners would be able to force implementation by suspending commitments to WTO agreements not named in the dispute. The approach is allowed in theory, but has not yet been tested in practice. * Compliance with WTO Dispute Rulings There {{have been a number of}} studies conducted on the extent of compliance within the WTO dispute settlement system. An analysis of 181 WTO disputes prior to July 1, 2002, found an 83 percent compliance rate. 1 Despite the high percentage of full or partial compliance, many of the disputes that led to <b>formal</b> <b>non-compliance</b> action includ...|$|E

According to Pierre Goldschmidt, former deputy director general and head of the department of safeguards at the IAEA, and Henry D. Sokolski, Executive Director of the Nonproliferation Policy Education Center, some other instances of safeguards noncompliance reported by the IAEA Secretariat (South Korea, Egypt) were never reported to the Security Council because the IAEA Board of Governors never made a <b>formal</b> finding of <b>non-compliance.</b> Though South Korea's case involved enriching uranium to levels near weapons grade, the country itself voluntarily reported the isolated activity and Goldschmidt has argued [...] "political considerations also played a dominant role in the board's decision" [...] to not make a <b>formal</b> finding of <b>non-compliance.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Some {{have argued}} {{that there is a}} double {{standard}} between the treatment of Iran, which was reported to the Security Council for undeclared enrichment and reprocessing activities, and South Korea, which had failed to report enrichment and reprocessing experiments but was not found in non-compliance. In South Korea's case, issues were reported by the IAEA Secretariat but the IAEA Board of Governors did not make a <b>formal</b> finding of <b>non-compliance.</b> In making its decision, the Board said [...] "there is no indication that the undeclared experiments have continued" [...] and observed that the [...] "Republic of Korea has an Additional Protocol in force and that developments in the Republic of Korea demonstrate the utility of the Additional Protocol."

5000|$|To address {{concerns}} that its enrichment program may be diverted to non-peaceful uses, Iran {{has offered to}} place additional restrictions on its enrichment program including, for example, ratifying the Additional Protocol to allow more stringent inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency, operating the uranium enrichment facility at Natanz as a multinational fuel center with the participation of foreign representatives, renouncing plutonium reprocessing and immediately fabricating all enriched uranium into reactor fuel rods. Iran's offer to open its uranium enrichment program to foreign private and public participation mirrors suggestions of an IAEA expert committee which was formed to investigate the methods {{to reduce the risk}} that sensitive fuel cycle activities could contribute to national nuclear weapons capabilities. Some non-governmental U.S. experts have endorsed this approach. The United States has insisted that Iran must meet the demands of the UN Security Council to suspend its enrichment program.In every other case in which the IAEA Board of Governors made a finding of safeguards non-compliance involving clandestine enrichment or reprocessing, the resolution has involved (in the cases of Iraq and Libya) or is expected to involve (in the case of North Korea) at a minimum ending sensitive fuel cycle activities.

2500|$|After public {{allegations}} about Iran's previously undeclared nuclear activities, the IAEA launched {{an investigation that}} concluded in November 2003 that Iran had systematically failed to meet its obligations under its NPT safeguards agreement to report those activities to the IAEA, although it also reported no evidence of links to a nuclear weapons program. The IAEA Board of Governors delayed a <b>formal</b> finding of <b>non-compliance</b> until September 2005, and reported that non-compliance to the UN Security Council in February 2006. After the IAEA Board of Governors reported Iran's noncompliance with its safeguards agreement to the United Nations Security Council, the Council demanded that Iran suspend its enrichment programs. The Council imposed sanctions after Iran refused to do so. A May 2009 U.S. Congressional Report suggested [...] "the United States, and later the Europeans, argued that Iran's deception meant it should forfeit its right to enrich, a position likely to be up for negotiation in talks with Iran." ...|$|R
