Alternatively, the <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> {{may have a}} line of weakness around the cap which gives way allowing the larva to emerge.

5|$|Under normal {{conditions}} about 75% {{of the eggs}} hatch. Hatching success can drop to about 35% in unusually hot conditions. <b>Egg</b> <b>shell</b> thinning, a potential cause of egg mortality, {{can be caused by}} pollutants. About 78% of chicks fledge in normal years, with that percentage only dropping slightly, to 77%, in abnormally hot years. Most egg and chick mortality during periods of normal climate is caused by nest fights between the parents and other birds. Breeding adults usually survive the year, with only about 18% dying every year. The young have a lower survival rate, with about 29% dying each year. The lifespan for this bird is anywhere from 16 to 30 years.|$|E

25|$|Eggs {{are laid}} in holes during the Australian dry season (usually in August) and hatch at the {{beginning}} of the wet season (November/December). The crocodiles do not defend their nests during incubation. From one to five days prior to hatching, the young begin to call from within the eggs. This induces and synchronizes hatching in siblings and stimulates adults to open the nest. It is not known if the adult that opens a given nest is the female which laid the eggs. As young emerge from the nest, the adult picks them up one by one in the tip of its mouth and transports them to the water. Adults may also assist young in breaking through the <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> by chewing or manipulating the eggs in its mouth.|$|E
25|$|Egg {{formation}} in M. javanica {{has been studied}} in detail, and is similar to egg {{formation in}} the well studied, free-living nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Embryogenesis has also been studied, and the stages of development are easily identifiable with a phase contrast microscope following preparation of an egg mass squash. The egg is formed as one cell, with two-cell, four-cell and eight-cell stages recognisable. Further cell division leads to the tadpole stage, with further elongation resulting {{in the first stage}} juvenile, which is roughly four times as long as the egg. The J1 stage of C. elegans has 558 cells, and the J1 of M. javanica likely has a similar number, since all nematodes are morphologically and anatomically similar. The <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> has three layers, with the vitelline layer outermost, then a chitinous layer and a lipid layer innermost.|$|E
2500|$|Before infecting a {{nematode}} egg, P.lilacinum flattens {{against the}} egg surface and becomes closely [...] to it. P.lilacinum produces simple appressoria {{anywhere on the}} nematode <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> either after a few hyphae grow along the egg surface, or after a network of hyphae form on the egg. The presence of appressoria appears {{to indicate that the}} egg is, or is about to be, infected. In either case, the appressorium appears the same, as a simple swelling {{at the end of a}} hypha, closely appressed to the eggshell. Adhesion between the appressorium and nematode egg surface must be strong enough to withstand the opposing force produced by the extending tip of a penetration hypha. When the hypha has penetrated the egg, it rapidly destroys the juvenile within, before growing out of the now empty <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> to produce conidiophores and to grow towards adjacent eggs.|$|E

2500|$|Iron {{is needed}} for {{bacterial}} growth making its bioavailability {{an important factor in}} controlling infection. Blood plasma as a result carries iron tightly bound to transferrin, which is taken up by cells by endocytosing transferrin, thus preventing its access to bacteria. Between 15 and 20 percent of the protein content in human milk consists of lactoferrin that binds iron. As a comparison, in cow's milk, this is only 2 percent. As a result, breast fed babies have fewer infections. Lactoferrin is also concentrated in tears, saliva and at wounds to bind iron to limit bacterial growth. [...] Egg white contains 12% conalbumin to withhold it from bacteria that get through the <b>egg</b> <b>shell</b> (for this reason, prior to antibiotics, egg white was used to treat infections).|$|E

60|$|Considering {{the vicissitudes}} and disappointments {{of their life}} together, it was {{remarkable}} how certain they remained that they would at last cross the bar and reach the harbour of comfortable circumstance. They had, one may suppose, expectations in their blood. The germ of getting 'something for nothing' had infected their systems, so that, though they were not selfish or greedy people, and well knew how to rough it, they dreamed so {{of what they had}} not, that they continually got rid of what they had in order to obtain more of it. If for example Ralph received an order, he felt so strongly that this was the chance of his life if properly grasped, that he would almost {{as a matter of course}} increase and complicate the project till it became unworkable, or in his zeal omit some vital calculation such as a rise in the price of bricks; nor would anyone be more surprised than he at this, or more certain that all connected with the matter had been 'fat choughs' except--himself. On such occasions Eileen would get angry, but if anyone suggested that Ralph had overreached himself, she would get still angrier. She was very loyal, and fortunately rather flyaway both in mind and body; before long she always joined him in his feeling that the whole transaction had been just the usual 'skin-game' on the part of Providence to keep them out of their expectations. It was the same in domestic life. If Ralph had to eat a breakfast, which would be almost every morning, he had so many and such imaginative ways of getting from it a better breakfast than was in it, that he often remained on the edge of it, as it were. He had special methods of cooking, so as to extract from everything a more than ordinary flavour, and these took all the time that he would have to eat the results in. Coffee he would make with a whole <b>egg,</b> <b>shell</b> and all, stirred in; it had to be left on the hob for an incomparable time, and he would start to catch his train with his first cup in his hand; Eileen would have to run after him and take it away. They were, in fact, rather like a kitten which knows it has a tail, and will fly round and round all day with the expectation of catching that desirable appendage. Sometimes indeed, by sheer perseverance, of which he had a great deal in a roundabout way, Ralph would achieve something, but, when this happened, something else, not foreseen by him, had always happened first, which rendered that accomplishment nugatory and left it expensive on his hands. Nevertheless they retained their faith that some day they would get ahead of Providence and come into their own.|$|E
