5|$|Not {{only was}} the supply of {{available}} aircraft poor, by the then Director of Organisation at the Air Ministry Charles Portal recognised {{there would be a}} future problem in procurement of aircraft. Coastal Command's operational nature would make twenty-four hour operations a basic requirement. Suitable aircraft for take-off and landing, in particular flying-boats, in all weather was vital for the safety of crews and the effectiveness of the Command. The new twin-engine Saro Lerwick had been touted as the ideal aircraft. It only came into service in April 1939 and was then found to be unsuitable. There was a need for long-range machines to cover the South-Western Approaches. In December 1939 to August 1940 the following reinforcements were sent: No. 10 Squadron RAAF received Sunderlands, No. 235 Squadron RAF, No. 236 Squadron RAF, No. 248 Squadron RAF and No. 254 Squadron RAF equipped with Bristol Blenheims from RAF Fighter Command in February 1940; in June 1940 No. 53 Squadron RAF and No. 59 Squadron RAFs with Blenheim on loan from RAF Bomber Command, and in August 1940, No. 98 Squadron RAF's Fairey Battles, also on loan from the Bomber Service and based in Iceland. By 15 June a further 15 squadrons were to have been handed over to Coastal Command, this was only achieved by the loan of seven squadrons from other commands, despite <b>express</b> <b>agreement</b> by the Air Ministry and Admiralty. The daily operational strength of Coastal Command amounted to 298 aircraft, most unsuitable for maritime operations. Within a month, that had risen to 39 squadrons and 612 aircraft. However they were made of 11 different types, causing training and conversion problems.|$|E

500|$|Nelson's {{response}} was to <b>express</b> <b>agreement</b> with Murray that such situations could occur, but reminded him that on whatever he [...] might be called, or whatever measure he might be directed to carry into execution, he never should forget the intimacy which subsisted between them; and even, should anything go contrary to his wishes, he would wave the rank of admiral, and explain, or expostulate with him, as his friend, Murray. Murray then accepted the post, and remained with Nelson as his captain of the fleet during the blockade of Toulon between 1803 and 1805, and the subsequent chase of Villeneuve and his fleet to the West Indies and back in 1805. He had been promoted to rear-admiral on 23 April 1804, but declined to raise his flag {{so as to be}} able to continue on with Nelson. The fleet returned to England in August 1805, where Murray learnt that his father-in-law had died, leaving him as executor of his estates. While Nelson sailed to take up command of the fleet blockading Cadiz, Murray was compelled to remain in England and attend to family affairs. Nelson did not therefore have a captain of the fleet at Trafalgar, for as one biographer stated [...] "none but Murray would do".|$|E

2500|$|However, the {{substantive}} theories are not universally accepted. More recently developed [...] "deflationary" [...] or [...] "minimalist" [...] theories of truth {{have emerged as}} competitors to the older substantive theories. Minimalist reasoning centres around {{the notion that the}} application of a term like true to a statement does not assert anything significant about it, for instance, anything about its nature. Minimalist reasoning realises truth as a label utilised in general discourse to <b>express</b> <b>agreement,</b> to stress claims, or to form general assumptions.|$|E

2500|$|Contract {{implied in}} fact. A person's assent {{to be bound}} by an {{agreement}} can be expressed or implied. In the latter case, assuming the requisite formalities for a valid contract are met, there is a perfectly normal contract. The only distinction between a contract arising by <b>express</b> <b>agreement</b> between two people and a contract implied-in-fact is that the latter was recognised by a court drawing inferences from facts proved at trial. When the plaintiff sued on either sort of contract, she was suing in the law of contract in respect of a consensually assumed obligation and her remedy for the defendant's breach was damages.|$|E
2500|$|While many {{agreements}} can be certain, {{it is by}} {{no means}} certain that in the case of social and domestic affairs people want their agreements to be legally binding. In Balfour v Balfour Atkin LJ held that Mr Balfour's agreement to pay his wife £30 a month while he worked in Ceylon should be presumed unenforceable, because people do not generally intend such promises in the social sphere to create legal consequences. Similarly, an agreement between friends at a pub, or a daughter and her mother will fall into this sphere, but not a couple who are on the verge of separation, and not friends engaged in big transactions, particularly where one side relies heavily to their detriment on the assurances of the other. This presumption of unenforceability can always be rebutted by <b>express</b> <b>agreement</b> otherwise, for instance by writing the deal down. By contrast, agreements made among businesses are almost conclusively presumed to be enforceable. But again, express words, such as [...] "This arrangement... shall not be subject to legal jurisdiction in the law courts" [...] will be respected. In one situation, statute presumes that collective agreements between a trade union and an employer are not intended to create legal relations, ostensibly to keep excessive litigation away from UK labour law.|$|E

I said that I went to the [...] board of trade without knowledge or relish, but had been very happy [...] there; found quite enough to occupy my mind, enough responsibility [...] for my own strength, and had no desire to move onwards, but should [...] be perfectly satisfied with any arrangement which he might make as [...] to Lord Ripon's successor. He spoke most warmly of service [...] received, said he could not be governed by any personal [...] considerations, and this which he proposed was obviously the right [...] arrangement. I then stated the substance of what I had put in my [...] memorandum, first on the opium question, to which his answer was, [...] that the immediate power and responsibility lay with the East India [...] Company; he did not <b>express</b> <b>agreement</b> with my view of the [...] cultivation of the drug, but said it was a minor subject as [...] compared with other imperial interests constantly brought under [...] discussion; intimated that the Duke of Wellington had surrendered [...] his opinion (I think) upon the boundary question; and he referred [...] to the change in his own views, and said that in future he [...] questioned whether he could undertake the defence of the corn laws [...] on principle. His words were addressed to a sympathising hearer. My [...] speeches in the House had already excited dissatisfaction if not [...] dismay.|$|E
