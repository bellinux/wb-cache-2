5|$|Amanita muscaria {{poisoning}} {{has occurred}} in young children and in people who <b>ingested</b> the mushrooms for a hallucinogenic experience. Occasionally it has been <b>ingested</b> in error, because immature button forms resemble puffballs. The white spots sometimes wash away during heavy rain and the mushrooms then {{may appear to be}} the edible A.caesarea.|$|E
5|$|Because {{scratches}} {{dominate the}} microwear {{texture of the}} teeth, Williams et al. suggested Edmontosaurus was a grazer instead of a browser, which would be predicted to have fewer scratches due to eating less abrasive materials. Candidates for <b>ingested</b> abrasives include silica-rich plants like horsetails and soil that was accidentally <b>ingested</b> due to feeding at ground level. The tooth structure indicates combined slicing and grinding capabilities.|$|E

5|$|In animals, {{amino acids}} are {{obtained}} through {{the consumption of}} foods containing protein. <b>Ingested</b> proteins are then broken down into amino acids through digestion, which typically involves denaturation of the protein through exposure to acid and hydrolysis by enzymes called proteases. Some <b>ingested</b> amino acids are used for protein biosynthesis, while others are converted to glucose through gluconeogenesis, or fed into the citric acid cycle. This use of protein as a fuel is particularly important under starvation conditions as it allows the body's own proteins {{to be used to}} support life, particularly those found in muscle.|$|E
5|$|Intentional {{overdosing}} (self-poisoning, with suicidal intent) {{is frequently}} implicated in paracetamol toxicity. In a 2006 review, paracetamol {{was the most}} frequently <b>ingested</b> compound in intentional overdosing.|$|E
5|$|Most <b>ingested</b> uranium is {{excreted}} during digestion. Only 0.5% {{is absorbed}} when insoluble forms of uranium, {{such as its}} oxide, are <b>ingested,</b> whereas absorption of the more soluble uranyl ion can be up to 5%. However, soluble uranium compounds tend to quickly pass through the body, whereas insoluble uranium compounds, especially when inhaled by way of dust into the lungs, pose a more serious exposure hazard. After entering the bloodstream, the absorbed uranium tends to bioaccumulate and stay {{for many years in}} bone tissue because of uranium's affinity for phosphates. Uranium is not absorbed through the skin, and alpha particles released by uranium cannot penetrate the skin.|$|E
50|$|Toxicity {{results from}} <b>ingesting</b> too much {{preformed}} vitamin A from foods (such as fish or animal liver), supplements, or prescription medications {{and can be}} prevented by <b>ingesting</b> {{no more than the}} recommended daily amount.|$|R
50|$|Four adults {{died in the}} US and Europe, after {{intentionally}} <b>ingesting</b> liquid. Two children, one in the US in 2014 {{and another}} in Israel in 2013, died after <b>ingesting</b> liquid nicotine. Death from accidental nicotine poisoning is very uncommon.|$|R
25|$|Grebes are {{peculiar}} {{in their}} habit of <b>ingesting</b> their own feathers and feeding {{them to their}} young. Observations on their diet of fish {{and the frequency of}} feather eating suggest that <b>ingesting</b> feathers, particularly down from their flanks, aids in forming easily ejectable pellets.|$|R
5|$|Nearly 24,000 {{metric tons}} of plastic are dumped into the ocean each year. Turtles ingest {{a wide array of}} this {{floating}} debris, including bags, sheets, pellets, balloons and abandoned fishing line. Loggerheads may mistake the floating plastic for jellyfish, a common food item. The <b>ingested</b> plastic causes numerous health concerns, including intestinal blockage, reduced nutrient absorption and malnutrition, suffocation, ulcerations, or starvation. <b>Ingested</b> plastics release toxic compounds, including polychlorinated biphenyls, which may accumulate in internal tissues. Such toxins may lead to a thinning of eggshells, tissue damage, or deviation from natural behaviors.|$|E

5|$|Although {{psilocybin}} may {{be prepared}} synthetically, {{outside of the}} research setting, it is not typically used in this form. The psilocybin present in certain species of mushrooms can be <b>ingested</b> in several ways: by consuming fresh or dried fruit bodies, by preparing a herbal tea, or by combining with other foods to mask the bitter taste. In rare cases people have injected mushroom extracts intravenously.|$|E

5000|$|Children may {{experience}} gastrointestinal distress upon <b>ingesting</b> excessive amounts of flavored toothpaste. Between 1990 and 1994, over 628 people, mostly children, were treated after <b>ingesting</b> too much fluoride-containing toothpaste. [...] "While the outcomes were generally not serious," [...] gastrointestinal symptoms {{appear to be}} the most common problem reported.|$|R
5|$|Chemical {{barriers}} also {{protect against}} infection. The skin and respiratory tract secrete antimicrobial peptides {{such as the}} β-defensins. Enzymes such as lysozyme and phospholipase A2 in saliva, tears, and breast milk are also antibacterials. Vaginal secretions serve as a chemical barrier following menarche, when they become slightly acidic, while semen contains defensins and zinc to kill pathogens. In the stomach, gastric acid and proteases serve as powerful chemical defenses against <b>ingested</b> pathogens.|$|E
5|$|Exposure occurs through inhalation, {{ingestion}} or occasionally skin contact. Lead may {{be taken}} in through direct contact with mouth, nose, and eyes (mucous membranes), and through breaks in the skin. Tetraethyllead, which was a gasoline additive and is still used in fuels such as aviation fuel, passes through the skin; however inorganic lead found in paint, food, and most lead-containing consumer products is only minimally absorbed through the skin. The main sources of absorption of inorganic lead are from ingestion and inhalation. In adults, about 35–40% of inhaled lead dust is deposited in the lungs, and about 95% of {{that goes into the}} bloodstream. Of <b>ingested</b> inorganic lead, about 15% is absorbed, but this percentage is higher in children, pregnant women, and people with deficiencies of calcium, zinc, or iron. Infants may absorb about 50% of <b>ingested</b> lead, but little is known about absorption rates in children.|$|E
5|$|Fly agarics {{are known}} for the unpredictability of their effects. Depending on habitat and the amount <b>ingested</b> per body weight, effects can range from nausea and {{twitching}} to drowsiness, cholinergic crisis-like effects (low blood pressure, sweating and salivation), auditory and visual distortions, mood changes, euphoria, relaxation, ataxia, and loss of equilibrium.|$|E

Also common is Taenia pisiformis, spread by <b>ingesting</b> rabbits and rodents. Rare {{tapeworm}} infections are caused by species of the genera Echinococcus, Mesocestoides, and Spirometra. There are usually no symptoms.|$|R
5|$|Fungi {{are used}} {{extensively}} to produce industrial chemicals like citric, gluconic, lactic, and malic acids, and industrial enzymes, such as lipases used in biological detergents, cellulases used in making cellulosic ethanol and stonewashed jeans, and amylases, invertases, proteases and xylanases. Several species, most notably Psilocybin mushrooms (colloquially known as magic mushrooms), are <b>ingested</b> for their psychedelic properties, both recreationally and religiously.|$|E
5|$|Gastroparesis {{is another}} common misdiagnosis. Like {{rumination}} syndrome, patients with gastroparesis often bring up food following the ingestion of a meal. Unlike rumination, gastroparesis causes vomiting (in contrast to regurgitation) of food, {{which is not}} being digested further, from the stomach. This vomiting occurs several hours after a meal is <b>ingested,</b> preceded by nausea and retching, and has the bitter or sour taste typical of vomit.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Frank Schofield, a Canadian {{veterinary}} pathologist, {{determined that}} the cattle were ingesting moldy silage made from sweet clover, {{and that this was}} functioning as a potent anticoagulant. Only spoiled hay made from sweet clover (grown in northern states of the USA and in Canada {{since the turn of the}} century) produced the disease. Schofield separated good clover stalks and damaged clover stalks from the same hay mow, and fed each to a different rabbit. The rabbit that had <b>ingested</b> the good stalks remained well, but the rabbit that had <b>ingested</b> the damaged stalks died from a haemorrhagic illness. A duplicate experiment with a different sample of clover hay produced the same result. In 1929, North Dakota veterinarian Dr L.M. Roderick demonstrated that the condition was due to a lack of functioning prothrombin.|$|E
