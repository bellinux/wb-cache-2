5|$|With few teams, but a long history, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> intense rivalries have {{developed}} in Canadian football. Far {{and away the}} greatest Toronto Argonauts rivalry {{has been with the}} Hamilton Tiger-Cats and its precursor teams. Fittingly, the Argonauts first game was against a club from Hamilton, while the raucous Eastern Final of 2013—featuring a Tiger-Cat win over the Argos in front of 35,000 at the Rogers Centre—proved the rivalry is alive and well. The two teams meet in Hamilton every year in the Labour Day Classic, a league wide tradition since the late 1940s in which the game's greatest rivalries are showcased.|$|E
25|$|Consequently, {{for each}} of the above {{definitions}} there exists a process of communication and message sending and receiving. In such a system of communication and representations <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> potential problems may arise; misunderstandings, errors, and falsehoods. The accuracy of the representations can by no means be guaranteed, as they operate in a system of signs that can never work in isolation from other signs or cultural factors. For instance, the interpretation and reading of representations function {{in the context of a}} body of rules for interpreting, and within a society many of these codes or conventions are informally agreed upon and have been established over a number of years. Such understandings however, are not set in stone and may alter between times, places, peoples and contexts. How though, does this ‘agreement’ or understanding of representation occur? It has generally been agreed by semioticians that representational relationships can be categorised into three distinct headings: icon, symbol and index.|$|E

2500|$|In {{answer to}} a {{question}} from a fellow candidate during the selection of top 5 finalists, Seifert believes that in [...] "Negros Occidental the principal problem {{is that there is no}} waste segregation, it is a problem because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> we all produce waste; out of 13 cities only three of the cities right now are practicing solid waste management. We need to cover 10 more and 19 more municipalities. Let’s not sit back and relax,” she said, as she stressed the need to take care of Mother Nature.|$|E
2500|$|Stephen Hawking, {{along with}} Thomas Hertog of CERN, {{proposed}} that the Universe's initial conditions consisted of a superposition of many possible initial conditions, {{only a small fraction}} of which contributed to the conditions we see today. According to their theory, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> we find our Universe's [...] "fine-tuned" [...] physical constants, as the current Universe [...] "selects" [...] only those past histories that led to the present conditions. In this way, top-down cosmology provides an anthropic explanation for why we find ourselves in a universe that allows matter and life, without invoking the ontic existence of the Multiverse.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{lowlands}} rainfall {{is most likely}} to occur throughout the year during the night or morning hours, and least likely in mid-afternoon. The most pronounced daily variations in rainfall occur during the summer because most summer rainfall consists of trade winds showers that most often occur at night. Winter rainfall in {{the lowlands}} is the result of storm activity, which is as likely to occur in the daytime as at night. Rainfall variability is far greater during the winter, when occasional storms contribute appreciably to rainfall totals. With such wide swings in rainfall, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> there are occasional droughts, sometimes causing economic losses. These occur when winter rains fail to produce sufficient significant rainstorms, impacting normally dry areas outside the trade winds that depend on them the most. [...] The winter of 2011-2012 produced extreme drought on the leeward sides of Moloka'i, Maui, and Island of Hawaii.|$|E

2500|$|An {{organisation}} {{with just}} one person cannot have any duplication of effort between employees. If there are two employees, {{there could be some}} duplication of efforts, but this is likely to be minor, as each of the two will generally know what the other is working on. When organisations grow to thousands of workers, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> someone, or even a team, will take on a function that is already being handled by another person or team. In colloquial terms, this is described as [...] "one hand not knowing what the other hand is doing". General Motors, for example, developed two in-house CAD/CAM systems: CADANCE was designed by the GM Design Staff, while Fisher Graphics was created by the former Fisher Body division. These similar systems later needed to be combined into a single Corporate Graphics System, CGS, at great expense. A smaller firm would have had neither the money to allow such expensive parallel developments, nor the lack of communication and cooperation which precipitated this event. In addition to CGS, GM also used CADAM, UNIGRAPHICS, CATIA and other off-the-shelf CAD/CAM systems, thus increasing the cost of translating designs from one system to another. This endeavor eventually became so unmanageable that they acquired (and then eventually sold off) Electronic Data Systems (EDS) in an effort to control the situation. Smaller firms typically choose a single off-the-shelf CAD/CAM system, with no need to combine or translate between systems.|$|E

60|$|Hawthorne {{was a man}} of fancy, and I {{suppose that}} in {{speaking}} of him <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> we should feel ourselves confronted with the familiar problem of the difference between the fancy and the imagination. Of the larger and more potent faculty he certainly possessed a liberal share; no one can read The House of the Seven Gables without feeling it to be a deeply imaginative work. But I am often struck, especially in the shorter tales, of which I am now chiefly speaking, with a kind of small ingenuity, a taste for conceits and analogies, which bears more particularly what is called the fanciful stamp. The finer of the shorter tales are redolent of a rich imagination.|$|E
6000|$|I perhaps exaggerate all this, and in insisting {{upon the}} merit of Daumier may appear {{to make light of}} the finer {{accomplishment}} of several more modern talents, in England and France, who have greater ingenuity and subtlety and have carried qualities of execution so, much further. In looking at this complicated younger work, which has profited so by experience and comparison, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> we should perceive it to be infinitely more cunning. On the other hand Daumier, moving in his contracted circle, has an impressive depth. It comes back to his strange seriousness. He is a draughtsman by race, and if he has not extracted the same brilliancy from training, or perhaps even from effort and experiment, as some of his successors, does not his richer satiric and sympathetic feeling more than make up the difference? ...|$|E

30|$|Figure  9 {{shows the}} {{distribution}} of wheel wear power under different running conditions. The wear power in the train model was greater than in the single car model, while the distribution characteristics were nearly the same in both models. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> noticed that the range of wheel contact along the wheel tread in the train braking model was wider than in the train idling model. Because the yawing movement of the guide wheelset was limited by the brake shoe, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> the angle of attack reduced. Meanwhile, as the train slowed down, the average wear power decreased. However, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>inevitable</b> <b>that</b> more serious wear occurred on {{the root of the}} flange when train braking was operated on a curved track.|$|R
