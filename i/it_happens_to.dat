25|$|In modern (20th century) {{theoretical}} physics, {{angular momentum}} (not including any intrinsic angular momentum – see below) is described {{using a different}} formalism, instead of a classical pseudovector. In this formalism, angular momentum is the 2-form Noether charge associated with rotational invariance. As a result, angular momentum is not conserved for general curved spacetimes, unless <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> be asymptotically rotationally invariant.|$|E
25|$|The {{distribution}} may {{be illustrated}} by the following urn model. Assume, for example, that an urn contains m1 red balls and m2 white balls, totalling N = m1 + m2 balls. Each red ball has the weight ω1 and each white ball has the weight ω2. We {{will say that the}} odds ratio is ω = ω1 / ω2. Now we are taking balls randomly {{in such a way that}} the probability of taking a particular ball is proportional to its weight, but independent of what happens to the other balls. The number of balls taken of a particular color follows the binomial distribution. If the total number n of balls taken is known then the conditional distribution of the number of taken red balls for given n is Fisher's noncentral hypergeometric distribution. To generate this distribution experimentally, we have to repeat the experiment until <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> give n balls.|$|E
25|$|Sir Isaac Newton had {{published}} his Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica in 1687 {{in which he}} gave a derivation of Kepler's laws, which describe {{the motion of the}} planets, from his laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation. However, though Newton had privately developed the methods of calculus, all his published work used cumbersome geometric reasoning, unsuitable to account for the more subtle higher-order effects of interactions between the planets. Newton himself had doubted the possibility of a mathematical solution to the whole, even concluding that periodic divine intervention was necessary to guarantee the stability of the Solar System. Dispensing with the hypothesis of divine intervention would be a major activity of Laplace's scientific life. It is now generally regarded that Laplace's methods on their own, though vital {{to the development of the}} theory, are not sufficiently precise to demonstrate the stability of the Solar System, and indeed, the Solar System is understood to be chaotic, although <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> be fairly stable.|$|E

25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the play, Walter and Beneatha's father has recently died, and Mama is waiting for a life insurance check for $10,000. Walter has a sense of entitlement to the money, but Mama has religious objections to alcohol and Beneatha has to remind him it is Mama's call how to spend it. Eventually Mama puts some of the money down on a new house, choosing an all-white neighborhood over a black one for the practical reason that <b>it</b> <b>happens</b> <b>to</b> be much cheaper. Later she relents and gives {{the rest of the money}} to Walter to invest with the provision that he reserve $3,000 for Beneatha's education. Walter passes the money on to Willy's naive sidekick Bobo, who gives it to Willy, who absconds with it, depriving Walter and Beneatha of their dreams, though not the Youngers of their new home. Meanwhile, Karl Lindner, a white representative of the neighborhood they plan to move to, makes a generous offer to buy them out. He wishes to avoid neighborhood tensions over interracial population, which to the three women's horror Walter prepares to accept as a solution to their financial setback. Lena says that while money was something they try to work for, they should never take it if it was a person's way of telling them they weren't fit to walk the same earth as them.|$|E

500|$|... "Til <b>It</b> <b>Happens</b> <b>to</b> You" [...] is {{a somber}} tune {{featuring}} orchestral production and soaring strings. The pop ballad delivers an empowering message: [...] "Hold {{your head up}} and be strong / When you fall you gotta get up", and {{has been described as}} [...] "stirring and emotional". Featuring a classical production, the song emphasizes Gaga's vocals, keeping focus on the lyrics, which clarifies that one cannot understand the feelings of a victim unless they have been in similar situation. The first verse is sung by Gaga in a vulnerable voice, which gradually changes into an aggressive tone, and finally a joyous one during the final lyrics. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com, [...] "Til <b>It</b> <b>Happens</b> <b>to</b> You" [...] is set in the time signature common for a slow tempo of 59 beats per minute. It is composed in the key of A minor with Gaga's vocals spanning from E3 to D5. The song follows a basic sequence of Am–C–Fmaj7–C–G/B as its chord progression.|$|E
