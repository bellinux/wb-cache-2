5|$|The {{building}} {{was in such}} a state of disrepair by the 1980s that it was almost demolished, and the nearby tracks were torn up and sold for scrap by 1984.

It was used as a real estate office, and the rail corridor itself was formally opened five years later as the Wallkill Valley Rail Trail. In 1999, the station became an <b>Italian</b> <b>restaurant</b> and received its current name, La Stazione.

This makes Mary more anxious and determined to find her sister.|$|E

5|$|Production {{returned}} to Manhattan to film the opening credits sequence. Filming {{then moved to}} Harlem, New York, where a hospice was used to film a scene involving the character Spider Simpson (Charles Gordone), {{and many of the}} hospice's elderly residents acted as extras for the scene. On April 17, 1986, the production team moved to Staten Island to film exterior and interior scenes involving the character Dr. Fowler (Michael Higgins). Filming then moved to Hoboken, New Jersey, which doubled for a scene set in a New Orleans train station. From April 28 to April 29, the production team {{returned to}} Harlem, where Parker filmed Rourke and De Niro's scene in a Harlem mission.

5|$|The {{script for}} The Seventh Victim went through several incarnations in the {{pre-production}} process. One version focused on an orphan {{caught in a}} murder plot amid California's Signal Hill oil wells; in this narrative, the heroine needed to solve the orphan's identity, saving him from becoming the seventh victim of the unknown killer. This version of the script was re-written entirely by DeWitt Bodeen {{under the supervision of}} producer Val Lewton. The new plot followed a young woman who uncovers a cult of Satanists in Greenwich Village. Bodeen purportedly based his idea for the film on a real Satanic society he had encountered in New York. The script incorporated other elements of his experiences in New York: Jacqueline's cosmetics business, La Sagesse, was inspired by his previous work as a journalist reporting on cosmetic companies, and the <b>Italian</b> <b>restaurant,</b> Dante's, was based on Barbetta, a restaurant in Manhattan's Theater District.|$|E
5|$|The Voyage Home was {{the first}} Star Trek film to {{extensively}} film on location—only one day was spent doing so in The Search for Spock. Much of the production was filmed in and around San Francisco during ten days of shooting. The production wanted to film scenes that were readily identifiable as the city. The use of extensive location shooting caused logistical problems; {{a scene in which}} Kirk is nearly run over by an irate cab driver required 12–15cars to be repositioned if the shot was incorrect, taking a half-hour to reshoot. Other scenes were filmed in the city but used sets rather than real locations, such as an <b>Italian</b> <b>restaurant</b> where Taylor and Kirk eat. In the film, the Bird-of-Prey lands cloaked in Golden Gate Park, surprising trashmen who flee the scene in their truck. The production had planned to film in the real park, where they had filmed scenes for The Wrath of Khan, but heavy rains before the day of shooting prevented it—the garbage truck would have become bogged down in the mud. Will Rogers Park in western Los Angeles was used instead.|$|E
