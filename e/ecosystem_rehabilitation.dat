30|$|The {{fact that}} some mine leases have been relinquished {{indicates}} that successful rehabilitation is possible.

Our review of studies conducted on invasion of rehabilitated agricultural production systems by nontarget species elucidates several factors that may increase the vulnerability of these systems to invasion. These systems often exist in highly fragmented and agriculturally dominated landscapes, where propagule sources of target species for colonization may be limited, and are established under conditions where legacies of past disturbance persist and prevent target species from persisting. Furthermore, rehabilitation approaches often do not include or successfully attain all target species or historical ecological processes (e. g., hydrology, grazing, and/or fire cycles) key to resisting invasion.

We propose a new approach, 2 ̆ 7 systematic rehabilitation planning 2 ̆ 7, that brings together advances made in conservation planning (cost-effectiveness analysis) and ecosystem science (understanding the complexity of ecosystem processes). This enables planning to be done at the catchment scale, and the trade-offs between various rehabilitation actions to be integrated and prioritised.

A project was initiated that aims for <b>ecosystem</b> recovery and <b>rehabilitation</b> by means of transporting water through an open canal to the lower reaches of the Tarim River. In this study, the ecohydrological responses of this rare type project are assessed. Water loss-runoff relationships and an index model for water loss rates and runoff are analyzed. The detected ecohydrological responses of the canal project include that water diversion dominates the dynamics of (1) the groundwater depth and (2) the tempo-spatial variation of riparian vegetation close to the water channel. The relationships between groundwater depth, vegetation coverage, species richness and soil water content are clearly the main factors contributing to the riparian vegetation. Variations of water mineralization are significant, both temporally and spatially, at each sampling station within the lower reaches of the Tarim River. The study provides basic information on water diversion and stream corridor restoration in the lower reaches of the Tarim River.

We focused on the mycorrhizal status of five representative plant species (Acacia saligna, Lotus creticus, Retama monosperma, Pistacia lentiscus and Juniperus oxycedrus) present in the Terga quarry. The arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) structures showed significant and contrasting rates of root colonization among plant species. Spores density in soil was generally high, but variable depending on soil disturbance and local conditions. AMF diversity study in the rhizospheric soil fraction resulted in the distinction of eleven spore morphotypes affiliated to four genera (Glomus, Scutellospora, Gigaspora and Acaulospora) with predominance of Glomus. The mycorrhizal soil infectivity (MSI) level could be considered as significant except in the rhizosphere of R. monosperma.

A major reason being the south Florida waters are subjected to potential PAH inputs from the Gulf of Mexico via oilrig accidents, as well as surface runoff and atmospheric combustion. Through legislation such as house bill (H. R. 1231) {{also known as the}} bill that reverses President Obama’s Offshore drilling moratorium act and house bill (H.

The greater understanding of how different concentrations of a PAH effect the targeted coastal zooplankton can lead to improved recovery times and mediation techniques. An oil spill that occurred at a Nigerian refinery covered 4 sq. km of a near by mangrove ecosystem.

40|$|To {{improve the}} {{ecological}} functioning of riverine <b>ecosystems,</b> large-scale floodplain <b>rehabilitation</b> {{has been carried}} out in the Rhine–Meuse Delta since the 1990 s. This paper evaluates changes in abundance of 93 breeding bird species over a period of 10 years in response to rehabilitation, by comparing population changes in 75 rehabilitated sites with 124 non-rehabilitated reference sites. Such quantitative, multi-species, large-scale and long-term evaluations of floodplain rehabilitation on biodiversity are still scarce, particularly studies that focus on the terrestrial component. We try to understand the effects by relating population trends to ecological and life-history traits and strategies of breeding birds. More specifically, we try to answer the question whether rehabilitation of vegetation succession or hydro-geomorphological river processes is the key driver behind recent population changes in rehabilitated sites. Populations of 35 species have significantly performed better in rehabilitated sites compared to non-rehabilitated floodplains, whereas only 8 have responded negatively to rehabilitation. Differences in effects between species are best explained by the trait selection of nest location. Reproductive investment and migratory behaviour were less strong predictors. Based on these three traits we defined eight life-history strategies that successfully captured a substantial amount of variation in rehabilitation effects. We conclude that spontaneous vegetation succession and initial excavations are currently more important drivers of population changes than rehabilitation of hydrodynamics. The latter are strongly constrained by river regulation. If rehabilitation of hydro-geomorphological processes remains incomplete in future, artificial cyclic floodplain rejuvenation will be necessary for sustainable conservation of characteristic river bird...|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} ant diversity, {{planting}} of eucalypts, and especially double-stripping of topsoil, has achieved diversity values in rehabilitated {{sites that are}} characteristic of the original forest. However, differences persist {{in the composition of}} the ant fauna. Furthermore, trajectories over the 37 + years encompassed by this study, as depicted by the principal co-ordinates analysis, indicate that the ant assemblages in rehabilitated sites are not developing towards those of the forest reference sites. This suggests that convergence to an original forest fauna composition may occur over much longer periods than examined here or may not occur at all. The <b>ecosystems</b> developing after <b>rehabilitation</b> using the techniques described in this study may be regarded as ‘novel’ ecosystems (sensu Hobbs et al. 20062009). Accepting ants as bioindicators of plant structure and floristic composition (Andersen and Majer 2004; Majer et al. 2007), these differences are likely to reflect persistent differences in plant species composition and structure in rehabilitated sites or other variables that recover over extended time frames such as the return of coarse woody debris (Koch et al. 2010). That said, {{with the exception of the}} seeded plot (which had been heavily over-seeded), the plots that had been planted with eucalypts and, especially, the one that had been double-stripped, continue to acquire new species and possess a fauna that has a reasonable resemblance to that of the original forest. This has continued to happen over 37 + years, indicating that these examples of rehabilitation are self-sustaining, novel ecosystems, which provide no serious concern to the values of the jarrah forest in which they are embedded. To answer the ultimate question of natural or novel still requires monitoring over extended periods, as has been the case with the current study.|$|R
