40|$|About the book: In {{recent years}} new {{translations}} and {{interpretations of the}} work of Vygotsky have generated considerable research activity by developmental psychologists and educational researchers on the relationship between the social and cognitive dimensions of learning. Rethinking Collaborative Learning aims to bring together, for the fist time in a single volume up to date and comprehensive research on collaborative learning and learning to collaborate from leading international workers in the field. The contributions converge around the questions of when and <b>how</b> <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> can facilitate understanding and learning, how we conceptualise the nature and quality of collaborative activity, how productive collaborative activity can be supported, and how children learn to collaborate. The book critically examines the ways in which psychologists and educational researchers conceptualise the nature and quality of collaborative activity and examines the different contexts in which such activity is studied...|$|R

Using a scenario study, initial reactions to a merger announcement were compared with socially infl uenced reactions. As anticipated, an overall strong detrimental effect of <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> on employee reactions was ob-served. Next, fi ndings indicate that deal characteristics (culture clash poten-tial, announced degree of integration, and position in deal structure) play a moderating role. Indeed, <b>how</b> <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> affects outcomes depends on the position in the deal structure. Qualitative data analysis of the group dis-cussions sheds light on how employee reactions become more detrimental.

40|$|Commencing {{university}} {{as an international}} student involves adjustment to multiple cultural frameworks: the host-nation culture, the multicultural student cohort, the institutional culture of the university, and the disciplinary culture of the area of study. Host-nation students may already possess much of this cultural knowledge and share learning spaces with international students but the two groups do not necessarily interact. We felt that these issues could be addressed using Peer Assisted Study Sessions (PASS). PASS employs established, high-achieving students to facilitate study sessions for new students. In PASS, the facilitator acts as a model student, {{rather than as a}} teacher, as the group works through the study material together. This format provides a structured, discipline-based forum for interaction in a non-threatening, non-assessed context. In this project, Australian third year bachelor students acted as PASS facilitators for new international masters students, leading study session activities focussed on scientific communication skills.

Anxious to make friends and seeking support to reach academic goals, first year students developed relationships with other residents {{in close proximity to}} them regardless of perceived differences before later branching out to form relationships outside of the floor. The strategies residents used to interact with diverse peers and included: 1) participating in neutral activities, 2) finding similarities, and 3) joking. By observing the living environments and actions of diverse others and by participating in neutral activity residents discovered hidden similarities. Residents in these diverse environments avoided serious conversations about race and ethnicity instead navigating diverse peer relationships by joking about differences.

40|$|Drawing on {{socio-cultural}} theory, {{this paper}} focuses on children's classroom-based collaborative creative writing. The central {{aim of the}} reported research was to contribute {{to our understanding of}} young children's creativity, and describe ways in which peer collaboration can resource, stimulate and enhance classroom-based creative writing activities. The study drew on longitudinal observations of ongoing activities in Year 3 and Year 4 classrooms (children aged 7 – 9) in England. Selected pairs’ collaborative creative writing activities were observed and recorded using video and audio equipment in the literacy classroom and in the ICT suite (13 pairs, about 2 – 4 occasions each). The research built on the contextualised, qualitative analysis of the social and cognitive processes connected to shared creative text composition. Using an analytic tool developed specifically for creative writing tasks, we linked collaborative and discursive features to cognitive processes associated with writing (‘engagement’ and ‘reflection’). The research has identified discourse patterns and collaborative strategies which facilitate ‘sharedness’ and thus support joint creative writing activities. The paper discusses two significant aspects of the observed paired creative writing discourse. It reports the significance of emotions throughout the shared creative writing episodes, including joint reviewing. Also, it shows children's reliance on collaborative floor (Coates, 1996), with discourse building on interruptions and overlaps. We argue that such use of collaborative floor was indicative of joint focus and intense sharing, thus facilitating mutual inspiration in the content generation phases of the children's writing activities. These findings have implications for both educational research and practice, contributing to our understanding of <b>how</b> <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> can be used to resource school-based creative activities...|$|R
40|$|Background: Learning in skills centers {{has a long}} {{tradition}} in nursing education. Nurse educators struggle to substantiate their opinions on the efficacy of simulation technologies over traditional methods of instruction and it is suggested that they should re-evaluate their methods when teaching psychomotor skills. A necessary step before evaluation is to unravel what the students are actually doing in the skills center. Purpose: The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore nursing students’ practical skills training in the skills center to label and define generic learning actions used during the learning of two specific skills; wound care and dressing, and sterile gloving. Methods: A qualitative observational study of nursing students’ practical skill training in the skills center was developed. Students across three cohorts were video recorded while practicing wound cleaning and dressing, and donning and removing sterile gloves. Verbal interaction on the video recordings was transcribed. The core analytical process was the joint listening to and watching of videos with following discussions of interpretations and development of categories. Results: Seven categories of learning actions were developed: Parallel action and self-instruction, watch and copy, collaborating to find solutions, giving support, seeking support, recontextualising the skill, and humorous enactment with the equipment. The categories are exemplified and discussed in light of learning theory and research on aspects of scaffolding. Conclusions: The learning actions described in this study are a starting point in detailing students learning actions during skills training. Students’ learning in other practical nursing skills should be studied to accumulate more knowledge about students’ learning actions and <b>how</b> <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> supports or hampers learning. The relevance of the learning actions should be explored in the clinical setting. A goal is to lay the groundwork for better design of learning in skills centers in nursing education...|$|R
40|$|<b>How</b> do social <b>peer</b> <b>interactions</b> (i. e. verbal helping behavior) {{during a}} {{cooperative}} learning (CL) curriculum in math affect the mathematical, linguistic, {{and social skills}} of 10 - 12 year old pupils from multiethnic classrooms? We developed a CL math curriculum in this thesis to investigate this question, consisting of: (a) a CL training (two lessons), (b) a CL math curriculum (nine lessons), and (c) an individual math exam. During the CL math curriculum, pupils were either stimulated to use verbal helping behavior in their <b>peer</b> <b>interactions</b> (experimental condition), or not stimulated (control condition). Being in the experimental condition proved beneficial for national pupils’ math scores, pupils’ linguistic proficiency -especially that of immigrant pupils - and pupils’ verbal helping behavior. Irrespective of condition, immigrant pupils displayed less helping behavior than national pupils. Mathematically high-achieving immigrant pupils were more motivated to cooperate {{in the control condition}} than in the experimental condition. Furthermore, the CL experience increased team members’ cooperativeness and popularity, and decreased the difference in cooperativeness and popularity between immigrant and national team members. Popularity and cooperativeness only increased within ethnically heterogeneous teams, extending the notion that enduring interethnic contact is fruitful for interethnic friendships. The implications of these results are discussed. Promotoren: P. Vedder, M. BoekaertsWith summary in Dutc...|$|R
40|$|Motivated {{primarily}} by a cognitive approach, with consideration of interactional processes from a sociocultural perspective, {{the present study}} examined the use of linguistic assistance and <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> to facilitate second language (L 2) writing of young ESL learners. A total of 257 Year 5 children (age 10) from twelve intact classes (from six different schools) took part in this eight-week intervention-based study. Using a quasi-experimental design, the classes {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three treatment groups or the control group. Pretests, interim tests, immediate posttests and delayed posttests were administered. As the study concerned both the processes and products of L 2 development, <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> and children's written production were taken as the two primary sources of data for this study. For the written production, four criteria were used to rate learners’ writings: Quality of ideas, Story shape and structure, Vocabulary and spelling and Implicit grammar. Partial correlation was employed to examine if there were any statistical relationships between treatment and learners’ written performance while controlling for prior attainment. Results show that the provision of enhanced and basic linguistic assistance may have a positive influence on only certain aspects of L 2 writing, while opportunities for <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> does not appear to have an impact on learners’ L 2 performance. For <b>peer</b> <b>interaction,</b> a subset of 60 learners were selected from the two treatment groups which received basic and enhanced linguistic assistance, to compare their dialogic performance. Based on quantitative analyses of their recorded interactions, the findings suggest that the provision of varying degrees of linguistic assistance may affect, not the content of <b>peer</b> discussions, but <b>how</b> <b>peer</b> assistance is given during task. The results also show that through the provision of linguistic assistance, <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> mediates the participants’ performance on Quality of ideas, Story shape and structure and Implicit grammar in their subsequent individual writing.

ZollmanIn {{this study}} we {{explored}} students' transfer of learning in the X-ray medical imaging context, including the X-ray-based computer-assisted tomography (or CAT). For this purpose we have {{conducted a series of}} clinical and teaching interviews. The investigation was a part of a bigger research effort to design teaching-learning materials for pre-medical students who are completing their algebra-based physics course. Our students brought to the discussion pieces of knowledge transferred from very different sources such as their own X-ray experiences, previous learning and the mass media. This transfer seems to result in more or less firm mental models, although often not internally consistent or coherent. Based on our research on pre-med students' models of X-rays we designed a hands-on lab using semi-transparent Lego bricks to model CAT scans. Without "surgery" (i. e. without intrusion into the Lego "body") students determined the shape of an object, which was built out of opaque and translucent Lego bricks and hidden from view. A source of light and a detector were provided upon request. Using a learning cycle format, we introduced CAT scans after students successfully have completed this task.

Results showed that diagnosis is related to social activities, but not to other aspects of <b>peer</b> <b>interaction.</b> Further, chronically ill girls had a lower level of social activities compared with healthy norms. In addition, girls with cystic fibrosis displayed more assertive behaviour than healthy girls, while chronically ill boys displayed less inadequate social skills than healthy boys. With regard to illness characteristics, functional limitations were not associated with <b>peer</b> <b>interaction.</b> However, pain was associated with restricted social activities in boys. It was concluded that in general, chronically ill adolescents were well adjusted socially and that functional limitations and pain {{do not seem to be}} risk factors for social adjustment problems. This healthy functioning might be a result of the presence of protective factors, such as the use of adequate coping strategies. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the role of <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> in {{cognitive}} development from the perspective of Piaget's and socio-cultural approach. The description of original Piagetian and Vygotskian ideas regarding the mentioned phenomenon and their comparison is given {{in the first part of}} the paper. Research studies of Piaget's and Vygotsky's followers brought theoretical and methodological innovations in the examination of <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> influence on cognitive development. At the beginning they were devoted to different aspects of social interaction. Piaget's followers recognized the importance of <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> for cognitive development and created a rich corpus of empirical data. The authors from socio-cultural perspective, following Vygotskian ideas, thoroughly investigated adult-child interaction and the consequences of difference in partners' competences on cognitive development in the process of adult's assistance within the child's ZPD. In the meantime, those two perspectives got closer and made the understanding of the phenomenon of <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> and its role in thinking development broader and more profound. Namely, Piagetians diverted attention to the importance of <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> for cognitive development and Vygotskians emphasized the relevance of asymmetry in peers' cognitive competences. The last part of the paper deals with studies of <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> which combine Piagetian and Vygotskian perspectives.

40|$|This thesis explores {{constructions of}} masculinity, deviancy and {{educational}} failure through an examination	of policy and	the discursive accounts provided by teenage boys, {{all of whom}} had been excluded from school, and educational practitioners working with such boys. This topic is of interest because the exclusion of boys with behavioural problems has been of significant concern to schools and policy makers for some time. Although the numbers of exclusions has reduced recently it remains a significant social justice issue because	permanent school exclusion is directly related to	deviancy and unemployment and disproportionally affects those who are already disadvantaged, such as the poor working-class and those with	special Educational Needs. This thesis contributes to understanding <b>how</b> boys’ <b>peer</b> <b>interactions</b> contribute towards perpetuating particular myths about masculine behaviour and its domination over females and alternative masculinities. It shows how some boys through drawing on discourses of hegemonic masculinity and gender binary asymmetries construct themselves in ways that contribute towards school confrontation. The voices of practitioners show how they contribute towards tensions and how education policy is considered as prohibiting staff from working effectively with some boys. 	 Consideration was given to literature discussing the social construction of parenting, childhood, and children’s "needs". Literature regarding the persistence of the role model discourse as both a cause and solution to boys’ problem behaviours in school is also investigated. Literature examining hegemonic masculinities was drawn on to further understand how it is performed and enforced through <b>peer</b> <b>interaction,</b> resulting in problematic behaviours which dominate particular constructions of masculinity. 	 The theoretical framework used for this study draws on the work of Foucault	(1970, 1977, 1980) who theorised that people construct truth through the dominant discourses which they draw on. It also explains how and why	 power is afforded to one discourse at the expense of another. The methodology	 adopted for this research utilizes this theoretical framework. 35 	narrative interviews were undertaken and examined using discourse analysis	 as discussed	 by Gee (2011) and Taylor (2001). The data collected was contrasted with literature to further understand the discourses respondents employed in their discursive constructions. This thesis exposes the challenges	that	boys and practitioners face as they negotiate the dominant masculine discourses at large in both school and home. It also shows that respondents’ understandings of masculinity rely on outmoded discourses of masculinity, essentialist gender binaries and constructions of childhood, which contribute towards problem behaviours in school. Tensions in school are also exacerbated by policy discourse and practitioners’ constructions of childhood. However, these normative discourses are challenged by respondents’ acknowledgment of alternative versions of masculinity and the coexistence of gender heteroglossia...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the {{relationship}} between social acceptance and observed <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> in a select group of preschool children. The subjects were 30 children enrolled in two sessions of a child development laboratory sponsored by the Department of Family Life at Oregon State University. The 15 children in the morning session, eight boys and seven girls, ranged in age from three years-eight months to four years-three months. The 15 children in the afternoon session, seven boys and eight girls, ranged in age from three years-six months to four years-five months. The data consisted of a social acceptance score taken from a picture sociometric interview and observed behavior frequencies recorded on the Social <b>Interaction</b> Scale (SIS). <b>Peer</b> <b>interactions</b> observed include aggresive-hostile <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> and cooperative- friendly <b>peer</b> <b>interaction.</b> The statistical analysis employed was the Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficient (r[subscript s]) method. The specific null hypothesis explored was: There will be no relationship between social acceptance and a) aggressive-hostile <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> b) cooperative-friendly <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> c) total frequency of <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> The correlation coefficients found between social acceptance and aggressive-hostile <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> in the morning session were positive and significant when analyzed for the sexes combined. A negligible correlation coefficient (r[subscript]s. 035) was indicated for boys and data revealed a tendency toward an inverse relationship (r[subscript s] -. 471) for morning girls. Negative, nonsignificant correlation coefficients were found for the afternoon session when the variables of social acceptance and aggressive-hostile peer interation were analyzed for sexes combined and for boys and girls separately. An r[subscript s] of. 686 indicated a positive significant correlation coefficient existing for the afternoon session when the variables of social acceptance and cooperative-friendly <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> were analyzed for sexes combined. No further significant correlation coefficients were shown for the afternoon session when analyzed by sex groupings. The correlation coefficients found for the morning session although negligible were in a negative direction. The Spearman Rank Correlation Coefficients calculated for the variables of social acceptance and total frequency of <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> were found to be significant only for the afternoon session. A positive significant correlation coefficient, r[subscript s]. 454, was found in the analysis for the sexes combined and a negative significant relationship, r[subscript s]-. 789, was found for boys. The correlation coefficient for the girls was negligible. No significant correlation coefficients were indicated for the morning session although there was a tendency toward a negative relationship when the session was analyzed for sexes combined and for girls. These findings indicate a need for further study of the relationship between social acceptance and observed <b>peer</b> <b>interactions.</b> The nature of the data collected in the present study provides avenues for further research...|$|R
40|$|A body of {{empirical}} research {{has revealed that}} there are associations among language skills, <b>peer</b> <b>interactions,</b> and behavioral problems in childhood. At the same time, however, there has been comparatively less research devoted to exploring the mutual unfolding of these factors over {{the first few years}} of life. The current study is designed to partially address this gap in the literature by examining how language skills, negative <b>peer</b> <b>interactions,</b> and behavioral problems are interrelated in a sample of twins drawn from the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study–Birth Cohort (ECLS-B). Employing a quantitative genetic framework, the results of the current study revealed that variance in language skills, negative <b>peer</b> <b>interactions,</b> and externalizing behavioral problems were all due to a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Bivariate Cholesky models indicated that most of the covariance among language skills, negative <b>peer</b> <b>interactions,</b> and externalizing behavioral problems was due to common genetic factors. Additional analyses using a modified DeFries–Fulker approach nested within a path model revealed a bidirectional association between negative <b>peer</b> <b>interactions</b> and externalizing behavioral problems, wherein there appeared to be feedback loops between the two. Implications of the results are discussed and avenues for future research are offered...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSocio{{linguistic}} {{studies have}} shown that linguistic usage is closely related to social relationships and interactions between individuals. This has been established in adults and adolescents but developmental studies involving children are lacking. This paper studies whether and <b>how</b> <b>peers</b> influence the acquisition of social dialects in young children by using direct observations and quantitative analyses of spontaneous <b>peer</b> <b>interactions</b> and relationships at kindergarten. The longitudinal follow-up of one group of French-speaking children 4 to 5 years of age shows that the individual scores of sociolinguistic variables converge after one year of frequent contact. Moreover, we find that children who interact more frequently adopt similar usage of sociolinguistic variables, whereas other factors have no influence (teacher’s speech, child’s awareness of standard sociolinguistics norms, reported interpersonal attraction). These results provide the first evidence that social <b>interactions</b> within the <b>peer</b> group do have an influence on children’s linguistic usage through daily interactions at an early age...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore {{negative}} <b>peer</b> <b>interactions</b> in foster care. Looked after children and young people have highlighted the impact of negative <b>peer</b> <b>interactions,</b> and especially <b>peer</b> violence and intimidation, on their care experiences. However, to date, no specific fostering research has addressed this important issue. In response to this gap, we undertook focus groups with 32 foster carers in the South West of England. Group discussions were semi-structured based around the issue of negative <b>peer</b> <b>interactions</b> in foster care. The analysis revealed five main associated themes: the impact on the carers' birth children; a lack of placement planning; inadequate referral information; a negative view of social work support; and insufficient external interventions. ‘We undertook focus groups with 32 foster carers in the South West of England’ Key Practitioner Messages •Negative <b>peer</b> <b>interactions,</b> particularly violence, were a major concern for foster carers, especially if they negatively impacted on the welfare of carers' birth children. •An absence of pre-placement referral information on negative <b>peer</b> <b>interactions</b> was commonly reported and placed all children in the fostering household at risk. •Associated social work support and external interventions were often perceived as lacking and inadequate. •Fostering procedures, review and decisions need to recognise the impact of peer violence on all members of the fostering household...|$|R

At this time, a teenager usually begin a “crush” the opposite sex. Among adolescents, dating become very proud identity. Usually a teenager will be proud and confident if you already have a boyfriend / girlfriend. Instead teens who do not have a boyfriend / girlfriend considered less slang.

Using data taken from an extensive University of Michigan longitudinal study, previously transcribed semi-structured interviews on peer relationships from {{a sample of}} 35 parentally bereaved children ages 6 to 15 were systematically coded as well as qualitatively analyzed. Exploratory dimensions of inquiry included incidence counts of teasing, <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> regarding bereavement, <b>peer</b> support, emotional response, and preference for interaction, among others. Hypotheses related to age, gender, and parental death type (anticipated vs. sudden) differences on peer support reception were tested. Major findings included: 88. 6 % of the sample experienced bereavement-related <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> and 71. 4 % received support from peers, although 71. 4 % preferred not to have bereavement-related <b>interaction</b> with <b>peers.</b> 51. 4 % experienced a positive emotional response to such <b>peer</b> <b>interaction,</b> while 51. 4 % experienced a negative emotional response (responses could coexist in one individual).

40|$|The peer {{relationships}} {{of young children}} with mild developmental (cognitive) delays recruited at 4 – 6 years of age were examined in a longitudinal study across a 2 -year period. Results revealed only modest increases in children’s <b>peer</b> <b>interactions,</b> {{a high degree of}} intraindividual stability, and the existence of a poorly organized and conflict-prone pattern of <b>peer</b> <b>interactions.</b> Child cognitive and language levels as well as family stress and support were associated with children’s <b>peer</b> <b>interactions.</b> A subgroup was identified of initially low interactors who were at especially high risk for future <b>peer</b> <b>interaction</b> problems. These findings further underscore the importance of designing and implementing early intervention programs in the area of {{peer relationships}} for children with mild developmental delays. For typically developing children, the preschool years constitute a period of rapid growth and de-velopment in the domain of peer relationships.
