5|$|The Mahdists {{immediately}} {{opened fire}} upon the Free State force, {{who remained in}} cover behind a rocky outcropping some ways from the Mahdist line. For half an hour the Mahdists continued to fire at Chaltin's companies to little effect, their shots passing harmlessly above the rocks. Meanwhile, Free State soldiers moved a Krupp <b>gun</b> <b>into</b> position which, under Sergeant Cajot, fired several shells into the Mahdists' ranks.|$|E
5|$|Assigned to the Atlantic Transport Service, Orizaba {{carried over}} 15,000troops in six convoy trips to France {{before the end}} of World War I. In one such voyage, Orizaba’s {{executive}} officer, ordnance expert William Price Williamson, worked closely with Commander Richard Drace White—Orizaba’s commanding officer, himself an ordnance expert—to develop a workable depth charge launcher which would provide the transport with a measure of protection from enemy submarines. Williamson set about modifying a Lyle <b>gun</b> <b>into</b> a depth charge launcher, and successfully tested it on 16 August 1918. While attempting another test with an increased propellant charge the following day, a defective fuse exploded the depth charge prematurely, killing Williamson and three other sailors. White, four other officers, and twenty-two enlisted men were also wounded in the blast.|$|E
5|$|Following {{a four-day}} reprieve {{away from the}} frontline, the 12th Battalion {{relieved}} the 9th Battalion at Lagnicourt on 14 April. Around dawn the following day, the Germans launched a fierce counter-attack against the 1st Australian Division's line. Breaking through the Australian line, the Germans forced back the 12th Battalion's D Company, which was {{to the left of}} Newland's A Company. Soon surrounded and under attack on three sides, Newland withdrew the company to a sunken road which had been held by Captain Percy Cherry during the capture of the village three weeks earlier, and lined the depleted company out in a defensive position on both banks. Establishing his platoon in position, Whittle noticed a group of Germans moving a machine <b>gun</b> <b>into</b> position to enfilade the road. As the gunners began to set up the weapon, Whittle, under heavy rifle fire, jumped from the road and single-handedly rushed the crew. Using his bombs, he succeeded in killing the entire group before collecting the gun and taking it back to A Company's position.|$|E

5|$|The Army {{decided that}} an {{individual}} machine gun, lighter than the M60, but with more firepower than the M16, would be advantageous; troops {{would no longer have}} to rely on rifles for automatic fire. Through the 1960s, the introduction of a machine <b>gun</b> <b>into</b> the infantry squad was examined in various studies. While there was a brief flirtation with the concept of a flechette- or dart-firing Universal Machine Gun during one study, most light machine gun experiments concentrated on the Stoner 63 light machine gun, a modular weapon that could be easily modified for different purposes. The Stoner63 LMG saw combat for a brief period in Vietnam with the Marine Corps, and later on a wider scale with the U.S. Navy SEALs.|$|E

When Rebus reads Aengus's journal, {{it becomes clear}} that he thought {{that he was about to}} be arrested for the murder of Tam Robertson. The journal also reveals that it was Cafferty who forced the <b>gun</b> <b>into</b> his hand, getting Aengus's fingerprints on it. After the shooting, Aengus went berserk, starting the fire to hide the evidence.|$|E

25|$|The {{explosion}} {{happened after}} Murray passed his illicitly-held loaded rifle to Morgan, {{so that the}} fireman could take pot shots at a flock of ducks on the water. Morgan tripped and accidentally discharged the <b>gun</b> <b>into</b> the load of blasting powder stored on deck. Following the ensuing explosion and fire, the captain grounded the ship on shore; those not killed or injured by the blast jumped ashore to safety.|$|E
25|$|More {{advanced}} improvised guns {{can make}} use of parts from other gun-like products. One example is the cap gun. A cap gun can be disassembled, and a barrel added, turning the toy <b>gun</b> <b>into</b> a real one; a firing pin can then {{be added to the}} hammer, to concentrate the force onto the primer of the cartridge. If the cap gun has a strong enough hammer spring, the existing trigger mechanism can be used as-is; otherwise, rubber bands may be added to increase the power of the hammer.|$|E
25|$|While the {{negotiations}} were still going on, another incident occurred inside the residence. Three Argentine tactical divers {{who survived the}} first skirmish along the compound inadvertently alerted Major Noott to their presence, while they had been preparing to leave their hiding place. The Major fired his Sterling submachine <b>gun</b> <b>into</b> {{the ceiling of the}} maid's room. According to British reports, the stunned commandos tumbled down the stairs, laying their weapons on the ground. They became the first Argentine prisoners of war of the Falklands War, although by then Governor Hunt had already been in contact with Argentine officials negotiating the terms of surrender.|$|E

25|$|During the Leopold Canal battle, the regiment's guns {{had to make}} rapid {{deployments}} in flooded {{and heavily}} mined ground under intermittent shellfire. Captain Alan Johnstone carried out hazardous reconnaissances in the forward areas for his Troop, and Gunner Daniel Kelly drove his gun tractor into action with determination, on occasions clearing mines to get his <b>gun</b> <b>into</b> action. Both were awarded the Belgian Croix de Guerre with palms, and Johnstone was also made a Chevalier of the Belgian Order of Leopold II. Yet the regiment's guns {{did not have to}} engage a single enemy aircraft during October.|$|E
25|$|On 12 June 1944,'B' Company was {{attempting}} to stem the enemy's advance when it came under heavy machine-gun and tank machine-gun fire. Rifleman Ganju Lama, with complete disregard for his own safety, took his PIAT gun and, crawling forward, succeeded in bringing the <b>gun</b> <b>into</b> action within 30 yards of the enemy tanks, knocking out two of them. Despite a broken wrist and two other serious wounds to his right and left hands he then moved forward and engaged the tank crew {{who were trying to}} escape. Not until he had accounted for all of them did he consent to have his wounds dressed.|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of the battle, Platoon Sergeant Matthew Leonard was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. After his platoon leader had been wounded {{at the start of the}} battle, Leonard {{organized}} the platoon defensive position, redistributed ammunition, and took control. While helping a wounded soldier to safety, he was hit in the hand by a sniper, but continued to fight instead of stopping to receive medical attention. Under cover of the main attack from the northeast, the communists moved a machine <b>gun</b> <b>into</b> a location where it could sweep the entire position of Leonard's platoon. Leonard charged the gun, and destroyed its crew despite being hit several times by enemy fire. He was eventually killed in this act.|$|E

In September 2012, Perilous Plunge closed for {{an expansion of the}} Boardwalk. Perilous Plunge was noticeably known as one of Knott's major thrill rides. The boardwalk reopened after a year transformation with two flat rides and a new family roller coaster taking the spot of Perilous Plunge. The Boomerang roller coaster also got repainted with a new vibrant green and yellow color scheme.|$|E
25|$|Montreal was recommissioned {{into the}} Royal Navy in December 1769 under Captain James Alms. She {{returned}} to the Mediterranean the following year, and was {{under the command of}} Captain Christopher Atkins from about September 1772. She paid off again in March 1773, and was surveyed at Chatham in April. A small to middling repair was carried out between July 1777 and February 1778, and she recommissioned in November 1777 under Captain Stair Douglas. She sailed to North America in April 1778, and was afterwards sent to the Mediterranean. While in North America Douglas was court-martialled for firing a <b>gun</b> <b>into</b> a small boat during some horseplay, killing a midshipman. He was acquitted on the grounds that he had not meant to kill. While in the Mediterranean Montreal formed part of Vice-Admiral Sir Robert Duff's squadron.|$|E
25|$|The next day, {{the hunters}} separate, {{with the younger}} one manning a spot high on a cliff near a {{waterfall}}. He descends from his post to wash {{up in a small}} waterfall in the hills. His gun out of reach, the hunter suddenly finds himself cornered by the grizzly, who rears and roars {{at the sight of the}} man. Faced with certain death, the hunter cowers in fear. The grizzly, seemingly affected by the hunter's distress, turns and leaves. The young hunter, impressed by the bear's act of mercy, attempts to scare him off more quickly by shooting his <b>gun</b> <b>into</b> the air. When the hunter's companion joins him, having heard the gunshots, the younger man tells him that the bear is dead. However, spying the bear ascending a scree, the older man raises his rifle to shoot, only to be stopped by the other man. The three hunters return to their camp empty-handed, where they free the young cub and then ride off into the wilderness.|$|E
