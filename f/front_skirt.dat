The shield of the Ζ Plus C1 was also extensively modified to allow it to carry a highly accurate beam smartgun.|$|E

50|$|Externally, the bumpers {{were changed}} from chrome to alloy and rubber {{starting}} with the late 1976 Silver Shadows. These new energy absorbing bumpers {{had been used in}} the United States since 1974, as a response to tightening safety standards there. Nonetheless, the bumpers on cars sold outside of North America were still solidly mounted and protruded 2 inch cm less. Also now made standard across the board was the deletion of the small grilles mounted beneath the headlamps. Outside of North America, where tall kerbs and the like demanded more ground clearance, a <b>front</b> <b>skirt</b> was also fitted to the Silver Shadow II and its sister cars.|$|E

50|$|In 1949 and 1950, the 26 Class 03.10 {{locomotives}} remaining {{with the}} Deutsche Bundesbahn were refurbished by Henschel in Kassel. The streamlined shells {{on all the}} locomotives were removed, mainly due to their poor condition. Externally, these engines can still be distinguished from the Class 03 by their still-recognisable steam dome, their cut-down smokebox door, the flat Erhebung of the superheater regulator, the air reservoirs, the missing <b>front</b> <b>skirt,</b> and {{the shape of the}} driver's cab and tender.The locomotives were stationed in Dortmund, Ludwigshafen and Offenburg after their refurbishment. The three engines stabled at the locomotive depot or Bw Dortmund, numbers 03 1014, 03 1022 and 03 1043, were given a special steel blue livery in June 1950 for their boilers, cabs, and cylinder blocks. The smokebox and chimney remained painted black.|$|E

50|$|A bedgown (sometimes bedjacket or shortgown) is {{an article}} of women's {{clothing}} for the upper body, usually thigh-length and wrapping or tying in front. Bedgowns of lightweight printed cotton fabric were fashionable at-home morning wear in the 18th century. Over time, bedgowns (also called in this context shortgowns) became the staple upper garment of British and American female working-class street wear from the 18th to early 19th centuries, worn over petticoats and often topped with an apron. Made of sturdy cotton, linen, wool or linsey-woolsey, these bedgowns were simply cut to a T-shaped pattern, and were worn overlapped in front or with the <b>front</b> <b>skirts</b> cutaway.|$|R
50|$|Aerodynamics plays a {{vital role}} in the DTM. For this reason, the BMW Motorsport {{engineers}} devoted {{a lot of time to}} issues such as aerodynamic drag and air flow. As on the production model, the air curtains at the front of the BMW M4 DTM are designed to reduce air drag. Narrowing air ducts accelerate the airstream flowing through the <b>front</b> <b>skirt,</b> guide it systematically past the wheels, and reduce turbulence around the wheel arches. Another new feature on the BMW M4 DTM is a plate along the side channel, which lends the racing car an even more striking outline. The flatter rear window optimises the way the airflow approaches the rear wing. The striking wing mirrors, with their twin-stalk mounts, are already a striking feature of the production model, and the mirrors on the BMW M4 DTM have also been aerodynamically optimised for the racetrack to ensure they aid efficient airflow towards the rear of the car.|$|E
50|$|Like Peugeot's earlier 205 T16, the mid-engine Lancia Delta S4 was a Delta in {{name and}} body styling only (for {{marketing}} purposes), and shared virtually nothing {{in terms of}} construction with the production front-engine Delta. The chassis was a tubular space frame construction much like the 037. It featured long travel double wishbone suspension front and rear, with a single large coil over at the front and separate spring and twin shock absorber at the rear. The bodywork was made of a carbon fibre composite with front and rear bodywork fully detachable for fast replacement due to accident damage, allowing ease of access during on-event servicing. The bodywork featured several aerodynamic aids including bonnet opening behind the front-mounted water radiator with Gurney flap, front splitter and winglets moulded into the front bumper panel, flexible <b>front</b> <b>skirt,</b> and rear deck lid wing that featured both a full aerofoil wind section twinned with a deflection spoiler. The door construction style was brought from the 037 with a hollow shell all-Kevlar construction that had no inner door skin, no door handle or window winder. The door was opened with a small loop and the windows were fixed perspex with small sliding panels to allow some ventilation and passing of time cards and suchlike.|$|E
40|$|This project present about <b>front</b> <b>skirt</b> of Proton Satria car. The {{objective}} {{this project}} is design and fabricates <b>front</b> <b>skirt</b> of Proton Satria car. Front skirts are fabricated using fiberglass as its raw material. The reason why front skirts are made out of fiberglass is because it {{is known for its}} lightness and it could stand shock or impact. When a car with an aerodynamic <b>front</b> <b>skirt</b> is speeding, the car will be stabilized by the <b>front</b> <b>skirt</b> because of its aerodynamic shape that produces downward force to the car therefore, the faster the car is the more stabilized it gets. The idea of fabricating front skirts for cars came because there's many product of this type already in the market. This makes it easier to find infonnation about how it is fabricated through the internet. The design of skirt that have curve shape can give aerodynamic properties such as that can reduce the air resistance when driving. Also, car looks nice and more speeding when using <b>front</b> <b>skirt.</b> Design three dimension the <b>front</b> <b>skirt</b> of Proton Satria is using solid work software. The result for first product is cannot successful because the mould polystyrene is inactive when touch resin. The result for second product is successful when use reused <b>front</b> <b>skirt</b> as a mould. The result for testing to assemble <b>front</b> <b>skirt</b> with Proton Satria model car is successful without problem. As conclusion, {{this project is}} successful followed by objective and scope...|$|E
