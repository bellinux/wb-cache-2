25|$|The {{two most}} popular {{approaches}} are injection of DNA in saline, using a standard hypodermic needle and gene gun delivery. Injection in saline is normally conducted intramuscularly (<b>IM)</b> <b>in</b> skeletal muscle, or intradermally (ID), delivering DNA to extracellular spaces. This can be assisted by electroporation; by temporarily damaging muscle fibres with myotoxins such as bupivacaine; or by using hypertonic solutions of saline or sucrose. Immune responses to this method can be affected by factors including needle type, needle alignment, speed of injection, volume of injection, muscle type, and age, sex and physiological condition of the recipient.|$|E

50|$|A younger {{researcher}} on the subject, East Berlin born historian Ilko-Sascha Kowalczuk, questioned this figure in 2013, but without providing any similarly careful estimate {{of his own}} as {{to the number of}} <b>IMs</b> <b>in</b> 1988/89. There is a suggestion that Müller-Enbergs' higher figure includes people who operated under more than one cover name and in more than one IM category, leading to some double counting in his revised figure. Another consideration is that the Stasi data include many people who never actually reported anything to them. The Stasi themselves archived the records of nearly 10,000 inactive <b>IMs</b> <b>in</b> 1987. In 1988 the Stasi were using, internally, the much lower figure of 110,000. Kowalczuk also questioned the extrapolated figure for IMs based outside the country.|$|R

2500|$|Many Chinese, Korean, and Vietnamese {{surnames}} are of {{the same}} origin, but simply pronounced differently and even transliterated differently overseas in Western nations. [...] For example, the common Chinese surnames Chen, Chan, Chin, Cheng and Tan, the Korean surname Jin, {{as well as the}} Vietnamese surname Trần are often all the same exact character 陳. [...] The common Korean surname Kim is also the common Chinese surname Jin, and written 金. [...] The common Mandarin surnames Lin or Lim (林) is also one and the same as the common Cantonese or Vietnamese surname Lam and Korean family name Lim (written/pronounced as <b>Im</b> <b>in</b> South Korea). Interestingly, there are people with the surname of Hayashi (林) in Japan too. The common Chinese surname 李, translated to English as Lee, is, in Chinese, the same character but transliterated as Li according to pinyin convention. Lee is also a common surname of Koreans, and the character is identical.|$|E

Kapsai tend to modify word beginnings. If a word starts in ei or e, they often {{replace it with}} ai or a (aik instead of eik – go, ažeras instead of ežeras – lake). Zanavykai also modify vowels, but {{in the other direction}} (ekmuo replaces akmuo – stone, ešis instead of ašis – axis). Kapsai often add a v to words that, in standard Lithuanian, start with uo, u, or o (vuoga instead of uoga – berry, voras instead of oras – air) and j to words that start with i, y, or i.e. (jilgas instead of ilgas – long, jieva instead of ieva – bird cherry). [...] Zanavykai tend to shorten words. They often drop n from verbs (gyvek instead of gyvenk – live!) and truncate the past tense form of verbs (žino instead of žinojo – he [...] knew, galė instead of galėjo – he could, ė instead of ėjo – he walked). Zanavykai also preserved some archaic forms and rules of declension, especially in pronominal pronouns, and of conjugation, especially in dual verbs.|$|E

40|$|According to the {{narrative}} approach, change in self-narratives {{is an important}} part of successful psychotherapy. In this view, several authors have highlighted the usefulness of narrating new experiences (like actions, thoughts, and stories) during therapy in contrast with maladaptive client self-narratives. These new experiences are termed here innovative moments (IMs), and different types can be specified: action, reflection, protest, reconceptualization, and performing change. With the aim of understanding which therapist skills are related to client IMs, we analyzed the association between exploration, insight, and action skills and <b>IMs</b> <b>in</b> two initial, two middle, and two final sessions of three good outcome (GO) and three poor outcome (PO) cases of emotion-focused therapy (EFT) for depression. IMs occurred more often in GO than PO cases. Furthermore, in GO more than PO cases, exploration and insight skills more often preceded action, reflection, and protest <b>IMs</b> <b>in</b> the initial and middle phases of EFT, but more often preceded reconceptualization and performing change <b>IMs</b> <b>in</b> the final phase. Action skills were more often associated with action, reflection, and protest IMs across all phases, especially in the final phase, of GO EFT...|$|R

40|$|Considerable {{research}} has focused on candidate impression management (<b>IM)</b> use <b>in</b> unstruc-tured interviews. However, little {{research has}} explored candidate <b>IM</b> use <b>in</b> other, frequently used assessment methods. This study examines the extent to which candidates, under consid-eration for a promotion, use verbal <b>IM</b> tactics <b>in</b> two types of structured individual assessment methods: a situational interview and a role-play. Based on a cybernetic model of IM, we predicted that IM use and effectiveness would vary across the two methods. Thus, this study examines the consistency of IM use across assessment methods; an issue that has not previ-ously been explored. As expected, the situational interview resulted in greater use of candidate IM tactics. Additionally, other-focused tactics were used significantly more frequently than self-focused tactics in both assessment methods. <b>IM</b> use <b>in</b> the situational interview predicted assessor ratings and final promotion scores, while <b>IM</b> use <b>in</b> the role-play did not.

40|$|Many product {{development}} programs consist of multiple integrated product teams (IPTs) and functional groups. Interteam information dependencies greatly affect program success. Program integration has thus {{become an issue}} of increasing interest.

Two types of <b>IMs</b> are investigated <b>in</b> this paper: (1) Systems engineering and interface optimization and (2) Improved information and communication technologies. As the appropriateness of a given IM varies {{as a function of}} many parameters—such as program stage, size, complexity, risk, etc. —the goal of this research was not to formulate a universal template for IM application. Rather, it is hoped that the lessons learned by these five programs will help others determine the appropriateness of particular <b>IMs</b> <b>in</b> their situations. Also, the continued development of an IM categorization scheme will hopefully prove useful to those developing an integration “tool kit. ...|$|R
