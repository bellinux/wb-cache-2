The interviewer is impressed by her qualifications and a glowing recommendation from Ryan, and hires her.

5|$|Everyone I {{talked to}} {{seemed to have}} a {{relative}} or a friend who'd been through it. That was the other thing – everyone reacts to the problem differently so there's no textbook way of playing Ruth in her present situation. In fact, the way I'm playing <b>her</b> <b>now</b> might surprise some people because in the past she's been such a strong character and here she is collapsed and weeping and thinking the worst. Occasionally you may suggest to the script editor that you don't think your character will react a certain way, but with Ruth I have absolute trust in the scriptwriter's characterisation.|$|E

In February she endorsed Scott Murphy, who had been chosen by the New York Democrats as their nominee for <b>her</b> <b>now</b> vacant seat in the House of Representatives. In April Murphy won the seat against Republican Jim Tedisco by 399 votes and succeeded Gillibrand in the House until 2011.|$|E
60|$|And as for cares, {{what are}} cares {{when a man}} is in love? Once more they had met; once more he gazed upon that sunny and {{sparkling}} face; once more he listened to that sweet and thrilling voice, which sounded like a bird-like burst of music upon a summer morning. She moved, and each attitude was fascination. She was still, and he regretted that she moved. <b>Now</b> <b>her</b> neck, <b>now</b> <b>her</b> hair, <b>now</b> <b>her</b> round arm, <b>now</b> <b>her</b> tapering waist, ravished his attention; now he is in ecstasies with <b>her</b> twinkling foot; <b>now</b> he is dazzled with her glancing hand.|$|R

5|$|Once in Remalna-city, Mel {{finds herself}} popular {{in part because}} of <b>her</b> <b>now</b> legendary {{rebellion}} against the unpopular King Galdran. She acquires many male admirers, and is friendly but dismissive towards their romantic attentions. Mel avoids Shevraeth when possible, though when she often unexpectedly encounters him, Mel fights to remain cordial while he remains inscrutable but polite. Meanwhile, Galdran's sister, the Marquise of Merindar, attempts to manipulate Mel into distracting Shevraeth from her covert plans to take the throne for herself, though this is largely unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|After {{a memorable}} 90th birthday, {{where she was}} {{surrounded}} by <b>her</b> <b>now</b> vast family, Zita's strong health began to fail. She developed inoperable cataracts in both eyes. Her last big family gathering took place at Zizers, in 1987, when her children and grandchildren joined in celebrating Empress Zita's 95th birthday. While visiting her daughter, in summer 1988, she developed pneumonia {{and spent most of}} the autumn and winter bedridden. Finally, she called Otto, in early March 1989, and told him she was dying. He {{and the rest of the}} family travelled to her bedside and took turns keeping her company until she died in the early hours of 14 March 1989. She was 96 years old, and was the last surviving child of Robert, Duke of Parma from both his marriages.|$|E
5|$|Lhermitte {{filed for}} and {{received}} a judgment of divorce before her trial; Moqadem at first appealed the decision but later withdrew his objection. Following the trial, Lhermitte {{was not able to}} pay for the trial costs, so under Belgian law it fell to <b>her</b> <b>now</b> ex-husband to pick up the bill. This conformed to the Law of Belgium, with the state seeking funds due to have been shared from the sale of their house under their divorce agreement. The overall court expenses and fines were 72,743 euros (about $93,000). Moqadem said he was “disgusted and revolted” by the injustice of this billing system. Moqadem’s attorney attempted to have the bill written off, calling for “administrative requirements to be balanced by decency” given the nature of the tragedy.|$|E

5|$|The {{company also}} began a close working {{relationship}} with Ida Lupino of Four Star International. She starred in two suspense films with Robert Ryan—Nicholas Ray's On Dangerous Ground (1952, though shooting had been completed two years earlier) and Beware, My Lovely (1952), a coproduction between RKO and Lupino's company, The Filmakers. Of more historic note, Lupino was Hollywood's only female director during the period; of the five pictures The Filmakers made with RKO, Lupino directed three, including <b>her</b> <b>now</b> celebrated The Hitch-Hiker (1953). Exposing many moviegoers to Asian cinema for the first time, RKO distributed Akira Kurosawa's epochal Rashomon in the United States, sixteen months after its original 1950 Japanese release. The only smash hits released by RKO in the 1950s came out during this period, but neither was an in-house production: Goldwyn's Hans Christian Andersen (1952) was followed by Disney's Peter Pan (1953).|$|E
5|$|At the apartment, Father John and Lloyd find Linda {{has moved}} out, but they {{discover}} she had possessed a 12-year-old newspaper clipping about Father John's ordination. Father John offers Lloyd a job helping {{out at the}} church, which Lloyd accepts. Father John then returns to his church and cries, fearing he {{is too late to}} save Linda. Meanwhile, Linda goes to a bridge and is about to jump off when she encounters Gus, who offers her the rosary he received earlier from Father John. A grateful and emotional Linda hugs Gus. It is not revealed whether she commits suicide or not. In a confession to Father Ralph, Father John expresses guilt he did not absolve Linda before her confession abruptly ended. Father Ralph says that even if Linda is dead, her soul is immortal, and that Father John's penance is to absolve <b>her</b> <b>now.</b> Father John does so. The film ends with a childhood memory of young Linda at church, where a group of boys laugh at her old torn clothes until she is defended by a young John Buerlein, whose act seems to make a strong positive impact upon her.|$|E
5|$|Maria {{quickly learned}} of her husband's true character. She {{tried to ignore}} him by {{cultivating}} a greater appreciation for literature and the arts, but he became increasingly dissolute: he whored, gambled, and bankrupted the couple. Maria soon became pregnant after unwanted sexual encounters with her husband. As Maria's uncle is leaving for the continent, he warns Maria of the consequences should she leave her husband. This is the first that separation or divorce {{are discussed in the}} novel and Maria seems to take his words as inspiration rather than the warning they are meant to be. After Venables attempts to pay one of his friends to seduce Maria (a man referred to only as 'Mr. S') so that he can leave her for being an adulteress, Maria tries to leave him. She initially escapes and manages to live in several different locations, often with other women who have also been wronged by their husbands, but he always finds her. When she tries to leave England with her newborn child and the fortune <b>her</b> <b>now</b> deceased uncle has left them, her husband seizes the child and imprisons Maria in the asylum. At this point the completed manuscript breaks off.|$|E

5|$|Starting in 1929, Nevelson studied art {{full-time}} under Kenneth Hayes Miller and Kimon Nicolaides at the Art Students League. Nevelson credited {{an exhibition}} of Noh kimonos at the Metropolitan Museum of Art {{as a catalyst for}} her to study art further. In 1931 she sent her son Mike to live with family and went to Europe, paying for the trip by selling a diamond bracelet that <b>her</b> <b>now</b> ex-husband had given her on the occasion of Mike's birth. In Munich she studied with Hans Hofmann before visiting Italy and France. Returning to New York in 1932 she once again studied under Hofmann, who was serving as a guest instructor at the Art Students League. She met Diego Rivera in 1933 and worked as his assistant on his mural Man at the Crossroads at Rockefeller Plaza. The two had an affair which caused a rift between Nevelson and Rivera's wife, Frida Kahlo, an artist Nevelson greatly admired. Shortly thereafter, Nevelson started taking Chaim Gross's sculpture classes at the Educational Alliance. She continued to experiment with other artistic mediums, including lithography and etching, but decided to focus on sculpture. Her early works were created from plaster, clay and tattistone. During the 1930s Nevelson began exhibiting her work in group shows. In 1935, she taught mural painting at the Madison Square Boys and Girls Club in Brooklyn as part of the Works Progress Administration (WPA). She worked for the WPA in the easel painting and sculpture divisions until 1939. For several years, the impoverished Nevelson and her son walked through the streets gathering wood to burn in their fireplace to keep warm; the firewood she found served as the starting point for the art that made her famous. Her work during the 1930s explored sculpture, painting and drawing. Early ink and pencil drawings of nudes show the same fluidity seen in the works of Henri Matisse. Nevelson also created terra-cotta semi-abstract animals and oil paintings.|$|E
