500|$|Recently, Paul Stanley cited Big Star as {{influence}} to early Kiss moments, [...] "We've {{always been about}} verses, choruses, bridges (...)

500|$|Bob Mackey of US Gamer {{was more}} {{critical}} of the game, giving it 2 of 5 stars. Though initially praising its visuals and setting, Mackey found the puzzles {{to be very difficult}} and [...] "there's simply too much going on to <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> proper feedback about what I'm getting wrong", suggesting that [...] "Blow was maybe a little too close to his work".|$|E

500|$|Willia Frederick Collings died on 20 June 1927, and was {{succeeded by}} his widowed daughter. Towards {{the end of}} his life, he stopped {{requesting}} from the inhabitants the payment of tithes, wheat and poulage (a feudal tax of two chickens). Upon her accession, the new dame immediately reasserted her feudal rights, and even noted: [...] "They always <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> skinniest and oldest [...] ".|$|E

500|$|Actress Joy Kilpatrick {{was cast}} as Dawson's photo double. Dawson {{described}} {{having a great}} working relationship with her stand-in. Discussing Kilpatrick, she said, [...] "I {{was about to tell}} her what I was going to be doing so she could <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> beats that I could react to properly" [...] and found her to be supportive and intuitive. Kilpatrick was not credited for her performance in the episode. Kolbe noted that the episode used a lot of visual effects, specifically to create the illusion of the two versions of Torres. The casting of a photo double allowed Kolbe avoid relying on split screen. The scheduling was carefully planned to account for the make-up used for both roles.|$|E

500|$|Woon, a Peranakan, {{was born}} on 12 September 1956 in Singapore to schoolteachers. He was a head prefect at Pasir Panjang Primary School (which his father became {{principal}} of years later) and a prefect while at Raffles Institution. Following his A-levels he was considering business administration, but ended up accepting a scholarship from DBS Bank to study law instead. According to Woon in an April 2008 interview, [...] "When I went for the scholarship interview, the interviewer said, 'We looked at your results and {{you look like you}} might be a lawyer; {{would you like to do}} law?' I said, 'Fine, if you want to <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> scholarship to do law, I'll do law'. I didn't plan to do law." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 2009, a {{confidential}} memo {{written by the}} consul general of Israel in Boston, Nadav Tamir, was leaked to the Israeli media. In the memo, Tamir said that Israel's dealings with the Obama administration on differences over settlements were eroding US support. After Tamir was reprimanded by the Israeli government, Frank defended Tamir in a letter sent to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, in which Frank wrote: [...] "I was sorry to learn that he (Tamir) is being criticized because of his accurate reporting of significant (negative) sentiment in the United States... If {{the people who work}} for me did not <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> kind of straightforward, thoughtful analysis that the consul is providing, even if it wasn't the most welcome news, that failure - not the information - would cause me unhappiness." ...|$|E
500|$|Lovato's fifth album, Confident, was {{released}} on October 16, 2015, and received generally positive reviews from music critics. The album debuted at number two on the Billboard 200 with first-week sales of 98,000 copies. During the album's production, Lovato commented: [...] "I've already started recording for my new album, and I have plans to record during the tour. The sound just evolves into everything that I've been and everything that I want to become." [...] She further stated, [...] "I've never been so sure of myself as an artist {{when it comes down}} to confidence, but not only personal things, but exactly what I want my sound to be and what I know I'm capable of and this album will <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to show people what I can really do." ...|$|E

500|$|With Rhodes {{insisting that}} the band not perform live again until they were much tighter, the Clash rehearsed {{intensely}} over the following month. Strummer later described how seriously the band devoted itself to forging a distinct identity: [...] "We were almost Stalinist {{in the way that}} you had to shed all your friends, or everything that you'd known, or every way that you'd played before." [...] Strummer and Jones shared most of the writing duties—"Joe would <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> words and I would make a song out of them", Jones later said. Sometimes they would meet in the office over their Camden rehearsal studio to collaborate directly. According to a later description of Strummer's, [...] "Bernie [...] would say, 'An issue, an issue. Don't write about love, write about what's affecting you, what's important." ...|$|E
500|$|The Devastation class {{became more}} popular among the {{civilian}} population and in the Royal Navy as the ships got older. Rear-Admiral John Wilson, a former captain of the ship, stated in {{a meeting of the}} Royal United Services Institute discussing the most acceptable types of battleship in 1884, [...] "I also agree with my friend Captain Colomb that we have no type of ship to my fancy equal to the [...] or the good old Thunderer. <b>Give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> Thunderer, the hull of the Thunderer; she had bad engines, she was not arranged as I would like inside, she was badly gunned as we all know, and she had not enough light gun or sufficient armaments; but she carried [...] of coal, could steam at 10 knots from here to the Cape, and could fight any ship of her class on the salt water." ...|$|E
500|$|In July 2008, Jason Statham {{expressed}} interest in appearing as Daredevil in the future. Statham requested [...] "just <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> chance, I {{would love to be}} Daredevil." [...] Frank Miller commented in agreement [...] "I think he should be Daredevil too." [...] In October 2008, 20th Century Fox executive Tom Rothman said [...] "a Daredevil reboot is something we are thinking very seriously about." [...] Rothman added that [...] "what it really needs is, it needs a visionary at the level that Chris Nolan was. It needs someone, it needs a director, honestly, who has a genuine vision." [...] By February 2010, 20th Century Fox and New Regency were looking to develop the reboot with News Corp., with Peter Chernin producing and David Scarpa writing the script. On March 15, 2011, it was announced that filmmaker David Slade would be directing the reboot, [...] but he later had to drop out due to other obligations. Fringe writer and producer Brad Caleb Kane was hired to pen the Slade-directed film. On September 3, 2012, Duncan died, precluding him from reprising his role as Kingpin.|$|E

500|$|Saban {{was named}} {{head coach of}} the Bills for a second time in late 1971. When he arrived, Buffalo was coming off a 1–13 season, {{although}} the team had players including running back O.J. Simpson, who had run for 742 yards and five touchdowns that year. While the Bills had a 4–9–1 record, Simpson led the NFL in rushing yards in 1972. Under Saban, Simpson continued to improve in 1973, setting a single-game rushing record with 250 yards in the season opener against the New England Patriots. He surpassed the single-season rushing record later in the year with more than 2,000 yards. Before Saban's arrival, Simpson had never rushed for more than 742 yards in a season. Simpson credited Saban with helping him reach his potential. [...] "He saved my career", Simpson said in 1973, when he was named the NFL's most valuable player. [...] "He promised me he'd <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> football and give me an offensive line, and he sure kept his word." [...] The Bills had a 9–5 record that year but came in second in the AFC East and missed the playoffs.|$|E
500|$|The Alden Tavern is {{well known}} for being the site of the horsewhipping of a captive General Richard Prescott, {{commander}} of the British troops of Rhode Island, by the tavern's owner Captain Alden. Several days after Prescott's capture, he was escorted to General George Washington's headquarters, but on the trip came to dine at Alden's tavern. Several books detail different accounts and portrayals of the exchanges which led to Prescott's whipping, all involving the Prescott being served [...] "the common dish of corn and beans" [...] and throwing the food on the floor. Three of Benson Lossing's books recount this tale, in The Pictorial Field-Book of the Revolution Volume 1 (1852), Our Countrymen (1855) and Lives of Celebrated Americans: Comprising Biographies of Three Hundred and Forty Eminent Persons (1869). It also appears in similar wording in The Boys of '76: A History of the Battles of the Revolution by Charles Coffin in 1876, with Prescott's line being: [...] "Do you <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> pigs' feed". The story has persisted and a fictional account was referenced in 2010 in Martha Finley's Elsie Yachting with the Raymonds.|$|E
500|$|In 1835, Clifford {{was elected}} to the Massachusetts legislature, where he sat on a {{committee}} that revised the state's statutes. [...] In 1836 he served as an aide to Governor Edward Everett, a position he held until Everett lost the 1839 election. [...] Everett rewarded Clifford for his service by naming him district attorney for the southern district of the state in 1839, a post he held for ten years. [...] He was concurrently elected state senator representing Bristol County in 1845. [...] In 1849 he was appointed state attorney general by Governor George N. Briggs. [...] He was the only major appointed Whig official retained by Democrat George S. Boutwell after he took office in 1851. [...] Boutwell explained in his memoirs that Clifford [...] "was a good officer and an upright man, but he lacked the quality which enables a man to reach conclusions. [...] This peculiarity made him useful to me. He would investigate a subject, <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> authorities and precedents, and leave the conclusions to me. Next, {{there was no one in}} the administration party whom I wished to appoint. Mr. [...] Hallett was the candidate most generally supported. He was full of prejudices and he was not well instructed as a lawyer. In these respects Clifford was his opposite." ...|$|E

500|$|When a {{group of}} about 50 ZANU–PF activists briefly invaded Gwenoro in May 2000, Smith played down the incident, saying the intruders were just bored and out of work. [...] "There's no {{politics}} on the farm," [...] he said. Five months later, in England to address the Oxford Union, Smith described Mugabe as [...] "mentally deranged". The President announced in response that Smith would be arrested and tried for genocide if he ever came back to Zimbabwe, a threat that Smith mocked. [...] "I would love that. Let him try it," [...] he said—"It would <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> chance to tell the world the truth about this gangster... I will give him the date and time of arrival of my plane so he can meet me at the airport." [...] A mass of reporters descended on Harare International Airport on 7 November 2000 to witness Smith's arrest, but far from being detained, the former Prime Minister was greeted cheerily by immigration officers and allowed through without any obstruction. Telling the waiting pressmen that he was disappointed not to have met any confrontation, he commented: [...] "We have a president here who is mentally unstable and makes statements that have no bearing on reality", and went home unmolested.|$|E
500|$|On 7 January 1922, Speyer's {{partners}} {{published a}} letter supporting Speyer and rejecting {{the implications of}} his correspondence with his German relatives, stating that he was [...] "incapable of any act of treachery against the country of his adoption". Two days later, Speyer also issued a statement responding to the report and rebutting the committee's interpretation of the facts. He stated {{that he had been}} advised of the committee's investigation in 1919 and, after considerable delay by the Home Office, had persuaded it to carry out an investigation in America into allegations made against his conduct there. These investigations, he stated, had demonstrated that the allegations were false, but, after he returned to Britain for the formal hearing in 1921, a further series of allegations were presented regarding his business transactions. Speyer stated that the issues involved were of a trivial nature and were similar to those encountered by other British banks which had traded without censure. He stated that [...] "the whole thing is neither more nor less than the culmination of years of political persecution. The Home Secretary simply dared not <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> vindication to which I was entitled." [...] He challenged the government to publish the evidence presented, and [...] "to point to a strip of material evidence that would induce any fairminded man to support the monstrous conclusions of this report".|$|E
500|$|Johnny Depp as Captain Jack Sparrow: Rightful {{captain of}} the Black Pearl, Jack fell victim of mutiny from his crew under the {{direction}} of his first-mate Hector Barbossa. Left for dead, marooned on a deserted island, Sparrow is back in search of his ship and those who betrayed him. The role was originally written especially for Hugh Jackman, thus the name [...] "Jack Sparrow"; however, he was not well known outside his native Australia, so Disney cast the more famous Depp as Jack. Depp found the script quirky: rather than trying to find treasure, the crew of the Black Pearl were trying to return it in order to lift their curse; also, the traditional mutiny had already taken place. Initially Sparrow was, according to Bruckheimer, [...] "a young Burt Lancaster, just the cocky pirate." [...] At the first read-through, Depp surprised the rest of the cast and crew by portraying the character in an off-kilter manner. After researching 18th-century pirates, Depp compared them to modern rock stars and decided to base his performance on Keith Richards, who would later appear as Jack's father in [...] Although Verbinski and Bruckheimer had confidence in Depp, partly because it would be Bloom who was playing the traditional Errol Flynn-type, Disney executives were confused, asking Depp whether the character was drunk or gay, and Michael Eisner even proclaimed while watching rushes, [...] "He's ruining the film!" [...] Depp answered back, [...] "Look, these are the choices I made. You know my work. So either trust me or <b>give</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> boot." ...|$|E
