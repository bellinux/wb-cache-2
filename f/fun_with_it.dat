25|$|By using tape, I {{could do}} a thirty-five or forty-minute show, then edit {{it down to the}} twenty-six or twenty-seven minutes the program ran. In that way, we could take out jokes, gags, or {{situations}} that didn't play well and finish with only the prime meat of the show; the solid stuff that played big. We could also take out the songs that didn't sound good. It gave us a chance to first try a recording of the songs in the afternoon without an audience, then another one in front of a studio audience. We'd dub the one that came off best into the final transcription. It gave us a chance to ad lib as much as we wanted, knowing that excess ad libbing could be sliced from the final product. If I made a mistake in singing a song or in the script, I could have some <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> then retain any of the fun that sounded amusing.|$|E
500|$|I {{love this}} song for many reasons. It had a {{different}} sound {{than a lot of}} my songs.

Drummer Jon Coghill told The Sydney Morning Herald [...] "we wanted to have more fun and enjoy that we were a band, rather than chase what you're supposed to do", and guitarist Ian Haug said [...] "We all found that this is really important to us, but we wanted to make it more fun".|$|E

[...] He has sometimes used humor to convey his feelings. [...] "Salem's Suburbs" [...] and [...] "Your Heroes Are Dead" [...] examine how society blindly accepts opinions found on television and the internet. [...] "Caveman Jams" [...] was directed at critics who claimed their music was too aggressive. The song tells how a fan was inspired to leave a life of self-destruction. [...] "That song was written to be funny," [...] said Schwab, [...] " [...] was definitely written as a response to some experiences we've had as a band over the years, but {{in such a way that}} we're having <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> I tried to approach it comically." ...|$|E
500|$|Robert Canning of IGN was {{positive}} about [...] "Homer The Whopper", giving it an 8.6/10 rating. He {{commented that the}} first act of the episode was the strongest, while the others were weaker. Canning believed {{the reason for this}} was that the viewers have already seen Homer [...] "struggle with his weight countless times, and Rogen's trainer, though funny much of the time, will likely never be remembered as a classic guest role." [...] He added, however, that Rogen and Goldberg are able to find [...] "a few new angles with the weight jokes, so it's not a complete loss." [...] Overall, Canning thought [...] "Homer The Whopper" [...] was a good start to the twenty-first season, and although the plot may not be very original, the writers added [...] "freshness to the proceedings." [...] The A.V. Clubs Todd VanDerWerff did not think the script was as good as Gervais', but commented that Rogen and Goldberg [...] "managed to make a mostly amusing season premiere." [...] He added that he thought the Hollywood satirizing featured in this episode had been overused on the show, but [...] "the specificity of what the [...] was making fun of—trainers who help stars slim down (in this case, helping Homer slim down)—went a long way toward making the episode palatable." [...] VanDerWerff concluded that while the episode [...] "didn’t try anything new , [...] had <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> all the same." ...|$|E

500|$|Controversy {{was first}} {{reported}} by Australian music site Undercover.com.au on December 5, 2008, {{after the release}} of the album. Leonie Barsenbach, a housewife from Sydney, said, [...] "I was astonished and totally taken aback when I heard my 5 and 7 year old kids walking around the house singing 'F-U-C-K'... When I asked them what it was, they told me it was Britney Spears. I was horrified. I got them the Circus album but there was no warning on it... It is extremely offensive. I feel deceived." [...] Rolling Stone writer Daniel Kreps defended Spears, arguing that parents should have been aware of the singer's musical themes. After the song was announced as the third single from the album, American radio stations were unsure about playing the track due to its double entendre in the chorus. Program directors of Z100 and KIIS-FM compared the issues to be faced by their radio stations to the release of the 2005 The Black Eyed Peas single, [...] "Don't Phunk with My Heart", saying that [...] "listeners thought it was the other word, and so we had to change it to 'mess'". Program director Patti Marshall of Q102 said [...] "It's ok to put in on an album, have <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> <b>it,</b> but we're publicly owned, you know? [...] It's not about us. It's about the mom in the minivan with her 8-year-old." [...] WFLZ's Tommy Chuck said his station produced their own edit of the song that replaced [...] "seek" [...] with [...] "see", with the station's disc jockeys referring to it as [...] "If U See Amy".|$|E
500|$|The Open Door took 18 {{months to}} write. The new songs {{were written by}} Lee and Balsamo, who share credits for nine songs. Lee was the sole writer of [...] "Like You", [...] "Lithium" [...] and [...] "Good Enough", and co-wrote [...] "All That I'm Living For" [...] with guitarist John LeCompt. The singer confessed that after Moody's {{departure}} she had nobody to hold her back {{in the writing process}} and that Balsamo was lifting her up and pushing her to do something she would not have done with Moody. Regarding this, Lee said, [...] "He's a great writer, and it was just like we were just having <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> for a change. It was like, 'Let's stop taking everything so seriously and have fun,' and we wrote a lot of songs that I'm just totally in love with." [...] The singer further told The Sun, [...] " [...] got this sort of spooky, surreal element to his guitar writing [...] It’s really cool because it just works perfectly with what we do. He was really trying to create something so we were both discovering this new sound together and branching out [...] Writing with Terry was a unique experience in my life because I’ve never been able to just sit and write music with somebody and not be afraid of what they would say." [...] Lee went on explaining that the making of the album was [...] "really intense" [...] and that she came out [...] "feeling purified" [...] while her writing partner, Balsamo, lifted her [...] "to a whole new level of inspiration and possibilities". She said it was only about [...] "writing great music".|$|E
500|$|Fox was in {{negotiations}} to star as Jennifer Check since {{the film was}} announced in 2007, and was officially cast in October 2007. Fox said the reason she agreed to the role was her love for the script. [...] "I think what I loved about the movie is it's so unapologetic and how completely inappropriate it is at all times," [...] she said. [...] "That was my favorite part about the script and about the character. It's fun {{to be able to}} say the shit that she got to say and get away with it and how people find it charming." [...] Asked how acting in a film like this is different from acting in Transformers, Fox said [...] "there's [...] distractions, like there's no robots to distract you from whatever performance I do give. So, if it's terrible, you're gonna fucking know that it's really terrible". She said despite this aspect of the business being intimidating, she enjoyed portraying the character. [...] "I wasn't really sure what I was doing," [...] said Fox. [...] "I was just trying to have <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> <b>it</b> and I felt like I was able to make fun of my own image as to how some people might perceive Megan Fox to be. I was just sort of flying freely and I hope some of it works." [...] To prepare for her role as a living-dead teenager, Fox dropped to a near-frail 97 pounds and stayed out of the sun to keep her skin pale. In balancing out the film's horror with humor, she said she relied heavily on Diablo Cody's script and Karyn Kusama's direction to pull it off, stating, [...] "I have a very specific sense of humor, things that I think are funny aren't going to fly with middle America. It's going to eliminate some of the audience, so you need someone there to tell you you can't do that." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{record label}} speculated that Eminem {{would be the}} first artist to sell one million copies in an album's first week of release. These {{expectations}} placed a large burden on Eminem, who recalled, [...] "I was scared to death. I wanted to be successful, but before anything, I want respect. [...] " [...] After the album was finished, the record label felt that there were no songs that had potential to be a lead single. Feeling pressured, Eminem returned to the studio and wrote [...] "The Way I Am" [...] as his way of saying, [...] "Look, this is the best I can do. I can't give you another 'My Name Is. ' I can't just sit in there and make that magic happen. [...] " [...] However, after the song was added to the album, Eminem felt the urge to write another song, and gave a hook to Dr. Dre for him to create a beat, and went home to write new lyrics; the song eventually became [...] "The Real Slim Shady". The song also discusses Eminem killing Dr. Dre. The producer reflected, [...] "It was funny to me. As long as it's hot, let's roll with it ... in my opinion, the crazier it is the better.

40|$|Abstract This Bachelorthesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} local food production chains as a successful process in achieving sustainability through knowledge, awareness, attitude and behaviour. First of all, sustainable consumption {{appeared to be an}} important policy objective which relies upon informed ecological citizens that shape markets through consumption in accordance to their values and priorities. Cosmopolitan environmental awareness is essential for the viability of this process towards sustainable consumption, but is inherently political and also structurally limited. Local food production does increases local knowledge and environmental awareness in society at large by providing tactile spaces that enable social learning, but is mainly successful in attracting people with the ‘fun’ aspect of local food. In order to prevent that local food consumption becomes a red herring which conflates locality or <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> sustainability, <b>it</b> is crucial to connect the attractive character of local food production to the meaning of this production process as a way of expressing values and priorities. Consumers need to be addressed more actively on their role of ecological citizens...|$|R
6000|$|I {{might have}} escaped unnoted, but Clemens's {{familiar}} head gave us {{away to the}} reporters waiting at the elevator's mouth for all who went to see Gorky. As it was, a hunt of interviewers ensued for us severally and jointly. I could remain aloof in my hotel apartment, returning answer to such guardians of the public right to know everything that I {{had nothing to say}} of Gorky's domestic affairs; for the public interest had now strayed far from the revolution, and centred entirely upon these. But with Clemens it was different; he lived in a house with a street door kept by a single butler, and he was constantly rung for. I forget how long the siege lasted, but long enough for us to have <b>fun</b> <b>with</b> <b>it.</b> That was the moment of the great Vesuvian eruption, and we figured ourselves in easy reach of a volcano which was every now and then [...] "blowing a cone off," [...] as the telegraphic phrase was. The roof of the great market in Naples had just broken in under its load of ashes and cinders, and crashed hundreds of people; and we asked each other if we were not sorry we had not been there, where the pressure would have been far less terrific than it was with us in Fifth Avenue.

It was so dark there already that they thought they had better light up the pumpkin-glory and try it. They lit it up, and it worked splendidly; but they forgot to put out the match, and it caught some straw on the barn floor, and a little more and it would have burnt the barn down. The boys stamped the fire out in about half a second; and after that they waited till it was dark outside before they lit up the pumpkin-glory again. Then they all bent down over it to keep the wind from blowing the match anywhere, and pretty soon it was lit up, and the farmer's boy took the pumpkin-glory by its long neck, and stuck the point in the hole {{in the top of the}} pump; and just then the funniest papa came round the corner of the wood-house, and said: ...|$|E

A foot-bridge crossed it that you could jump up and down on and almost make touch the water, and there were happier boys, who did not go to school, fishing there with men who had never gone. Sometimes the schoolboys ventured inside of the flour-mill and the iron-foundry, but I do not think this was often permitted; and, after all, the great thing was to rush over to the river-bank, all the boys and girls together, and play with the flutter-mills till the bell rang. The market-house was not far off, and they went there sometimes when it was not market-day, and played among the stalls; and once a girl caught her hand on a meat-hook. My boy had a vision of her hanging from it; but this was probably one of those grisly fancies that were always haunting him, and no fact at all. The bridge was close by the market-house, but for some reason or no reason the children never played in the bridge. Perhaps the toll-house man would not let them; my boy stood in dread of the toll-house man; he seemed to have such a severe way of taking the money from the teamsters.|$|E
