5000|$|Any {{programmer}} who develops software {{participates in}} the informal method of verification known as <b>desk</b> <b>checking.</b> Debugging software as it is being developed {{is a form of}} <b>desk</b> <b>checking.</b> The developer sets breakpoints or checks the output from the model to verify that it matches the algorithms developed in the conceptual model.|$|E
50|$|While not {{the best}} {{technique}} for validating and verifying, <b>desk</b> <b>checking</b> can be useful. This is the only technique where the main responsibility to verify {{is placed on the}} author of the model. <b>Desk</b> <b>checking</b> consists of the author careful stepping through the model in an attempt to catch any inconsistencies. The author will thoroughly read all original documents, notes, and goals and try to verify that the completed product accurately and completely modeled everything that it set out to do. This is also the time when any incompleteness should be caught and corrected. While the responsibility does rest on the author, that does not mean reaching out to other experts for help is out of the question. <b>Desk</b> <b>checking</b> is clearly the least formal of the informal methods discussed, but is often a good first line of defense in catching errors, and attempting to verify and validate the model.|$|E
50|$|Studies {{have shown}} that a {{combination}} of these techniques need to be used to achieve high defect detection rate. Other studies showed that different people tend to find different defects. One study found that the Extreme Programming practices of pair programming, <b>desk</b> <b>checking,</b> unit testing, integration testing, and regression testing can achieve a 90% defect detection rate. An experiment involving experienced programmers found that on average they were able to find 5 errors (9 at best) out of 15 errors by testing.|$|E
40|$|A key {{decision}} {{in the development of}} high assurance software is that of choosing a formal methods tool. This paper describes a methodology to select a formal methods tool for use in the development of high assurance software. Some of the factors that make a tool suitable to the task can be evaluated with a <b>desk</b> <b>check,</b> while others can only be appreciated by “hands on ” testing. We describe the application of our methodology to a broad set of currently available formal methods tools, including a hands-on evaluation of one of the tools. The impact of the tools on the project development is also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Inspections, Reviews and walkthroughs {{are highly}} {{effective}} and efficient means for static software quality assurance. During {{the last three decades}} different variations and facets evolved on how to perform and apply such techniques, ranging from Fagan inspection over structured walkthroughs to Peer Reviews and simple <b>Desk</b> <b>Checks.</b> What is missing today is a systematic approach on how to select and apply the most appropriate technique under the consideration of the given development constraints and quality goals a company wants to achieve. This paper presents the first step towards a comprehensive planning framework for static quality assurance activities, i. e., the definition of a generic process that explicitly models the commonalities and variabilities of different techniques. The paper describes how such a process is defined by using concepts of product line engineering and how the generic process and a related decision model supports the selection of a technique...|$|R
5000|$|Technical reviews. One {{study found}} that the average defect {{detection}} rates of informal code reviews and <b>desk</b> <b>checking</b> are 25% and 40% respectively. Walkthroughs were found to have defect detection rate of 20% - 40%, but were found also to be expensive specially when project pressures increase. Code reading was found by NASA to detect 3.3 defects per hour of effort versus 1.8 defects per hour for testing. It also finds 20% - 60% more errors {{over the life of the}} project than different kinds of testing. A study of 13 reviews about review meetings, found that 90% of the defects were found in preparation for the review meeting while only around 10% were found during the meeting.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{development}} of tools to pin point the programming problems experienced by the bottom 25 % of students. Three tools were developed and are described in response to the results from a standard coding test. Tool 1 : Given a programming problem to code- usually a simple game or scenario that requires a loop with a nested decision- can the students pick what the structures are? Tool 2 : Given code but not a description of the problem, can they describe how the program will run? Once it has been demonstrated, can they draw an activity diagram that matches the code? In the electronic version can they <b>desk</b> <b>check</b> each variable? Tool 3 : Given a description of the game and {{a list of all the}} lines of code but jumbled, plus some extra structures, can they drag and drop the lines into a workable order? It is hoped that these tools will diagnose problems and act as intervention tools before the students sit a standard test: where they plan, draw an activity diagram and code a given problem...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper will}} argue that the {{strategy}} of emphasizing a specific testing technique (<b>desk</b> <b>checking)</b> should be extended by also putting an emphasis in all programming modules on writing tests with a unit testing framework (xUnit).

This discussion is followed by detailed concepts of the syntax of pseudocode; methods of defining the problem; the application of basic control structures {{in the development of}} the solution algorithm; <b>desk</b> <b>checking</b> techniques; hierarchy charts; and modul...|$|E
40|$|It {{took me a}} {{while to}} {{appreciate}} software economics My first exposure to software economics came on my first day in the software business, in June 1955 at General Dynamics in San Diego. My supervisor took me on a walking tour through the computer, an ERA 1103 which occupied most of a large room. His most memorable comment was, "Now listen. We're paying this computer six hundred dollars an hour, and we're paying you two dollars an hour, and I want you to act accordingly. " This created some good habits for me, such as defensive programming, careful <b>desk</b> <b>checking,</b> test planning, and analyzing before coding. But it also created some bad habits [...] a preoccupation with saving microseconds, patching object code, etc [...] which were hard to unlearn when the balance of hardware and software costs began to tip the other way. For example, when Fortran came to General Dynamics in 1957, there was a forward-looking bunch of programmers who came to work wearing Fortran T-shirts and bragged about how much faster they could develop programs. But I was still one of the recalcitrant assembly-language programmers, bragging about how we wasted less o...|$|E

50|$|The {{interior}} design consists of Spanish tile roofing, limestone flooring, and cavernous half-barrel ceiling. There is a café with indoor seating and an outdoor seating area patio. The building {{also has a}} children’s reading space called Pop Pop’s Place, with a glass half-moon layout so the children can encircle storytellers. A flat screen T.V. is in Pop's place for movie day in the children's area. There are pictures of the Sam Keach and his grandchildren around Pop Pop's Place. Carpet is the flooring inside the library except for the entrance and hallway. By the entrance there is the front <b>desk</b> to <b>check</b> in and check out borrowed items.

25|$|Another campus {{focal point}} is the main plaza, around {{which can be found}} Lory Student Center and Morgan Library, as well as several {{academic}} buildings. The Lory Student Center, named for former CSU president Charles Lory, houses Student Media, numerous organization offices, Student Government, and spaces to eat, drink and study. The Morgan Library was originally constructed in 1965 and named for former CSU president William E. Morgan. Following the flood of '97, this facility went through an extensive improvement project that included an addition to the main building and a renovation of the existing structure, with works completed in 1998. Current holdings include more than 2 million books, bound journals, and government documents. Morgan Library just finished a 13,000 square-foot addition called the Study Cube that will seat 80 additional patrons and is designed for 24-hour access. With a university issued ID card, students and staff will be able to access the Cube after hours. To accommodate, the Loan and Reserve <b>desk</b> will <b>check</b> out laptops and other accessories over night if checked out less than six hours prior to closing.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are four}} {{check-in}} areas. Check-in Area 1 (desks 101 to 118) {{is in the}} newest part of the airport (which opened on 16 July 2014) and serves almost exclusively flights operated by CanaryFly and Binter Canarias (mainly inter-island flights between the Canary Islands or to Morocco). At times of very high demand check-in Area 1 may provide overflow capacity for Areas 2, 3 and 4. Check-in Area 2 (desks 201 to 234) {{is located in the}} first part of the [...] "new" [...] airport which opened in 1973. This area was completely refurbished in 2014 and is normally used for flights handled by Ground Force (Globalia Handling). Check-in Area 3 (desks 301 to 352) is in the second part of the [...] "new" [...] airport which originally opened in 1991 and is used for flights handled by Iberia and Ground Force. Additionally, airline Norwegian Air Shuttle have dedicated check-in <b>desks</b> and self <b>check</b> in podiums located to the southern end of Area 3. Check-in Area 4 (desks 401 to 406) is located downstairs between the police station and the main car rental offices (Hertz, Europcar, CICAR, Top Car AutoReisen, Gold Car and Avis Rent a Car System), and is used exclusively by Ryanair.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the movie}} The Goodbye Girl (1977) {{starring}} Richard Dreyfuss and Marsha Mason, Benedict played the stage {{director of a}} production of Richard III in which Richard III was to be portrayed in the play as a stereotypical gay man. He was the patiently-eccentric butler in Dr. Necessiter's Gothic-castle apartment in The Man With Two Brains (1983). When Dr. Hfuhruhurr (Steve Martin) complains loudly that he just learned his wife is a slut, Benedict responds, [...] "Yeah, I've heard this." [...] He was in a short scene in the mockumentary This Is Spinal Tap (1984), playing Tucker Smitty Brown, the awkward <b>desk</b> clerk who <b>checks</b> in the band. Called a [...] "twisted old fruit" [...] by the band's manager Ian, he replies, [...] "I'm just as God made me, sir." [...] In 1988 he played 'Fairchild', Dudley Moore's butler in the movie Arthur 2: On the Rocks, the sequel to the hit 1981 film Arthur. That same year in the film Cocktail he would play a condescending business college professor to Tom Cruise's main character. In the 1990 film The Freshman, he would again play a condescending professor, this time an NYU film school professor of Matthew Broderick's main character. He also made an appearance as the incorrectly assumed title character in the 1996 film Waiting for Guffman, another mockumentary involving {{many of the same}} writers and actors as This Is Spinal Tap. He also played Fay's father in the story of [...] "Rumpelstitlkstin" [...] in the Between the Lions episode [...] "Hay Day".|$|R
50|$|The {{first floor}} {{contains}} the marble-walled lobby, flanked by terra cotta fountains, which has stained glass clerestory windows and ceramic tile flooring. In {{the vicinity of}} the lobby <b>desk</b> are a <b>check</b> room, attendant dispatch room, and elevators. The north and central portions of the building house the men's facilities: cooling room, pack room, steam room, hydrotherapy room, and bath hall. The women's facilities, considerably smaller in size, are {{at the south end of}} the building. Originally there was a 30 tub capacity. Although the men's and women's bath halls both have stained glass windows in aquatic motifs, the most impressive stained glass is the massive skylight in the men's area, with the DeSoto fountain centered on the floor directly below it. The second floor originally had dressing rooms, lockers, cooling rooms, and massage and mechano-therapy departments; now it is largely occupied by wood changing stalls, with entry to a centrally located quarry-tile courtyard for sunbathing. The third floor houses a massive ceramic-tiled Hubbard Currence therapeutic tub (a full body immersion whirlpool installed in 1938 when other hydrotherapeutic pools were also added), areas for men' s and women' s parlors, and a wood panelled gymnasium to the rear. The most impressive space on the third floor is the assembly room (now museum) where the segmentally arched vaults of the ceiling are filled in with arched, stained glass skylights. Arched wood-frame doors surrounded by fanlights and sidelights open out to the small balconies of the front elevation. The basement houses various mechanical equipment, a bowling alley (since removed), and the Fordyce spring - a glazed tile room with an arched ceiling and a plate glass window covering over the natural hot spring (spring number 46).|$|R
