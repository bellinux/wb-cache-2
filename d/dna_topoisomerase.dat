The proteins are typically around 100 amino acids in length, and exhibit toxicity {{in a number}} of ways: CcdB protein, for example, affects DNA gyrase by poisoning <b>DNA</b> <b>topoisomerase</b> II whereas MazF protein is a toxic endoribonuclease that cleaves cellular mRNAs at specific sequence motifs.

If DNA was present, it was {{composed}} of four nucleotides (deoxyadenosine, deoxycytidine, deoxythymidine, and deoxyguanosine), to the exclusion of other possible deoxynucleotides. The DNA was kept double-stranded by a template-dependent enzyme, DNA polymerase. The integrity of the DNA was maintained by a group of maintenance enzymes, including <b>DNA</b> <b>topoisomerase,</b> DNA ligase and other DNA repair enzymes. The DNA was also protected by DNA-binding proteins such as histones. The genetic code was composed of three-nucleotide codons, thus producing 64 different codons. Since only 20 amino acids were used, multiple codons code for the same amino acids.|$|E

Risk factors include exposure to an agent {{known to cause}} DNA damage, like radiation, benzene, and certain chemotherapies; other risk factors have been inconsistently reported. It {{can be difficult to}} prove a connection between a suspected exposure and the development of MDS, but the presence of genetic abnormalities may provide some supportive information. Secondary MDS can occur as a late toxicity of cancer therapy (therapy associated MDS, t-MDS). MDS after exposure to radiation or Alkylating agents such as busulfan, nitrosourea, or procarbazine, typically occurs 3-7 years after exposure and frequently demonstrates loss of chromosome 5 or 7. MDS after exposure to <b>DNA</b> <b>topoisomerase</b> II inhibitors occurs after a shorter latency of only 1-3 years and can have a 11q23 translocation.
