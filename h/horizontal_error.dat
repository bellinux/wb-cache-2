The dimensional accuracy of {{the result of the}} subtractive {{rapid prototyping}} is influenced by its process parameters. The aim of this research is to study and then develop a model that shows the influence of depth of cut, feed rate, and step-over on the vertical length <b>error,</b> <b>horizontal</b> length <b>error,</b> and depth error in subtractive rapid prototyping of polycarbonate material. This research implements response surface methodology to develop the model and then followed by the residual tests to evaluate the developed model.

40|$|Extraction {{of ground}} points using a basic stereo pair of {{commercial}} satellite electro-optical images typically yields vertical errors {{much smaller than}} expected. In particular, the magnitude of vertical <b>errors</b> relative to <b>horizontal</b> <b>errors</b> is significantly smaller than expected based on imaging geometry (convergence angle, etc.) alone. This paper suggests that temporal correlation or similarity of metadata (sensor position, attitude) errors between two same-pass images is the major cause of this phenomenon. It discusses the sources of temporal correlation, {{how it can be}} represented, and how an optimal ground point extraction algorithm detailed in the paper uses this representation in order to provide the best possible 3 D location and corresponding 3 x 3 error covariance for reliable predicted solution accuracy. This paper also provides an estimate for temporal correlation, approximately 0. 70 (70 %), and explains how this value was derived based on the ratio of measured 0. 9 p vertical errors to measured 0. 9 p <b>horizontal</b> <b>errors</b> compiled over many stereo pairs and ground truth points as described in various papers in the literature. As demonstrated in this paper, based on simulation and error propagation for typical stereo geometry, if this correlation is not accounted for, predicted 0. 9 p vertical error is approximately 60 % too large. Knowledge of temporal correlation is essential for reliable stereo accuracy prediction as well as proper modeling of a priori metadata uncertainty in the support of metadata adjustment in a value-added process, such as registration to sparse control or a block adjustment...|$|R

40|$|In deep {{sub-micron}} ICs, growing {{amounts of}} ondie memory and scaling effects make embedded memories increasingly vulnerable to reliability and yield problems.

We propose two-dimensional (2 D) error coding in embedded memories, a scalable multi-bit error protection technique to improve memory reliability and yield. The key innovation is the use of vertical error coding across words that is used only for error correction in combination with conventional per-word <b>horizontal</b> <b>error</b> coding.

A {{portable}} tillage profiler (PTP) {{was constructed}} using a laser distance sensor, a linear actuator, a portable PC, and a lightweight aluminum frame that can quickly and accurately measure aboveground and belowground soil disruption caused by tillage.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method of}} processing Global Positioning System (GPS) observations to achieve undifferenced ambiguity resolution. Dual-frequency carrier phase and pseudorange measurements are processed by specifying separate oscillator parameters for the carrier phase and pseudorange measurements. Carrier phase estimates of the oscillator errors are arbitrarily biased {{with respect to the}} pseudorange estimates, and ambiguity parameters are constrained to be integer-valued. A network solution is necessary to compute the satellite code and phase clocks required as fixed parameters in single-user Precise Point Positioning (PPP) solutions. In the PPP results presented here, the LAMBDA method was used to optimally resolve ambiguities at each epoch. Only a small improvement in position error is gained with 5 -minute static processing over 24 hours. However, there is a significant reduction in convergence time, and with 30 -sec static processing after 60 minutes, 90 % of solutions approach 2 cm <b>horizontal</b> <b>error,</b> compared to 10 cm for standard PPP. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of the extended Kalman filter (EKF) and the ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF) are assessed for soil moisture estimation. In a twin experiment for the southeastern United States synthetic observations of near-surface soil moisture are assimilated once every 3 days, neglecting <b>horizontal</b> <b>error</b> correlations and treating catchments independently. Both filters provide satisfactory estimates of soil moisture. The average actual esti-mation error in volumetric moisture content of the soil profile is 2. 2 % for the EKF and 2. 2 % (or 2. 1 %; or 2. 0 %) for the EnKF with 4 (or 10; or 500) ensemble members. Expected error covariances of both filters generally differ from actual estimation errors. Nevertheless, nonlinearities in soil processes are treated adequately by both filters. In the application presented herein the EKF and the EnKF with four ensemble members are equally accurate at comparable computational cost. Because of its flexibility and its performance in this study, the EnKF is a promising approach for soil moisture initialization problems. 1...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of Google Earth (GE), users commonly assume {{that it is a}} credible and accurate source of information. Consequently, GE's imagery is frequently used in scientific and others projects. However, Google states that data available in their geographic products are only approximations and, therefore, their accuracy is not officially documented. In this paper, the horizontal positional accuracy of GE's imagery is assessed by means of comparing coordinates extracted from a rural cadastral database against coordinates extracted from well-defined and inferred check points in GE's imagery. The results suggest that if a large number of well-defined points are extracted from areas of high resolution imagery, GE's imagery over rural areas meets the horizontal accuracy requirements of the ASPRS for the production of "Class 1 " 1 : 20, 000 maps. Nonetheless, the results also show that georegistration and large <b>horizontal</b> <b>errors</b> occur in GE's imagery.
