30|$|Twenty-seven {{patients}} had two arms with sufficient {{grip and release}} function, even though {{not all of them}} had an existing pincer grasp due to malformation of the hand or lower arm. The remaining four individuals were severely affected; two {{patients had}} only one right-sided fully functional arm and a short left arm without <b>grip</b> <b>function,</b> and the other two patients with bilateral short upper limbs did not have any <b>grip</b> <b>function</b> on any side. One of these limbs was a single finger attached directly to a left shoulder.|$|E
30|$|Furthermore, no {{significant}} differences were found in terms of the DASH score between subgroups with loss of either the pincer grasp or the functional <b>grip</b> <b>function.</b> These findings support that, even though many patients had substantial congenital defects (as evaluated by the ‘anatomical pincer grasp’), most individuals could use the rest of the arm in some other way and still got a satisfactory <b>grip</b> <b>function</b> (as evaluated by the ‘functional grip function’), thereby obtaining an acceptable performance level. None of the individuals in this study group needed their lower limbs as an alternative gripping ability.|$|E
25|$|Reconstructive surgery of {{the upper}} limb in tetraplegic {{patients}} began during the mid-20th century. The ﬁrst attempts at regaining <b>gripping</b> <b>function</b> of the hand probably took place in Europe {{at the end of}} the 1920s with the construction of ﬂexor-hinge splints.|$|R
25|$|In {{the early}} 1940s, a surgeon called Sterling Bunnell (1882–1957) was {{probably}} one of the ﬁrst to refer to the reconstruction of <b>gripping</b> <b>function</b> for the tetraplegic hand. He described surgeries of combining tenodeses and tendon transfers to restore hand function. He also advocated transferring the m. brachioradialis to the wrist extensors when these muscles are paralyzed.|$|R
30|$|Assessment of hand {{function}} in children {{was carried out}} {{in the form of a}} game familiar to them using the game tools and toys of various sizes, taking into account the child’s age and the defect of their hand, which allowed a more accurate assessment of the <b>gripping</b> <b>function</b> for making a decision on the choice of a complex of remedial and development training.|$|R

30|$|Dynamic {{reconstruction}} of the RCL is more widely described than for the UCL which is attributable to the required outcomes of surgery.

Although dynamic reconstruction is not as stable as static reconstruction, it is technically easier to perform and thus may suffice.|$|E
40|$|Many {{aspects of}} both <b>grip</b> <b>function</b> and tactile {{perception}} depend on complex frictional interactions {{occurring in the}} contact zone of the finger pad, which {{is the subject of}} the current review. While it is well established that friction plays a crucial role in <b>grip</b> <b>function,</b> its exact contribution for discriminatory touch involving the sliding of a finger pad is more elusive. For texture discrimination, it is clear that vibrotaction {{plays an important role in}} the discriminatory mechanisms. Among other factors, friction impacts the nature of the vibrations generated by the relative movement of the fingertip skin against a probed object. Friction also has a major influence on the perceived tactile pleasantness of a surface. The contact mechanics of a finger pad is governed by the fingerprint ridges and the sweat that is exuded from pores located on these ridges. Counterintuitively, the coefficient of friction can increase by an order of magnitude in a period of tens of seconds when in contact with an impermeably smooth surface, such as glass. In contrast, the value will decrease for a porous surface, such as paper. The increase in friction is attributed to an occlusion mechanism and can be described by first-order kinetics. Surprisingly, the sensitivity of the coefficient of friction to the normal load and sliding velocity is comparatively of second order, yet these dependencies provide the main basis of theoretical models which, to-date, largely ignore the time evolution of the frictional dynamics. One well-known effect on taction is the possibility of inducing stick–slip if the friction decreases with increasing sliding velocity. Moreover, the initial slip of a finger pad occurs by the propagation of an annulus of failure from the perimeter of the contact zone and this phenomenon could be important in tactile perception and <b>grip</b> <b>function...</b>|$|E
50|$|Biomechanical theory {{suggests}} that bone curvature in Palaeopropithecus hand bones {{is linked to the}} functional demands of the organisms environment.

25|$|In the 1950s, {{understanding}} of the tenodesis effect (See Tenodesis grasp) inﬂuenced the development of surgical techniques such as the static ﬂexor tenodesis. These procedures provided the basic functions of grasp and pinch. Tendon transfers were developed to accomplish both digital release and <b>gripping</b> <b>functions</b> in two surgical stages. The originators of these procedures were Lipscomb et al. , Zancolli, House et al.

30|$|Five {{individuals}} {{had severe}} malformations {{of the lower}} limbs and proximal femoral focal deficiency (PFFD), with significantly reduced function as found on the RAOS values. Twenty-seven patients had two fully functional arms and hands, {{despite the fact that}} 8 % of shoulders, 26 % of elbows/forearms and 70 % of hands were malformed. Loss of <b>gripping</b> <b>function</b> did not significantly affect the upper extremity function, as measured by the DASH score. Ten patients without major deformities had OA in the hips and 15 in the knees, mostly mild and with no effect on the RAOS value.|$|R
30|$|Evaluation of {{the upper}} {{extremities}} focused on hand and <b>grip</b> <b>function,</b> rather than a description of each malformation; a hand {{was defined as the}} existence of a palm (complete or part of) with more than two fingers. An anatomical pincer grasp was defined as the existence of a functional thumb with opposition, i.e. not necessarily an original thumb. <b>Grip</b> <b>function</b> was defined as any hand with the ability to hold items, regardless of an existing pincer grasp and regardless of where the hand was located on the upper extremity, as long as it served as a gripping tool, which also included a release mechanism. In order to perform a general evaluation of the physical abilities, individuals were grouped in terms of the severity of the total musculoskeletal burden. A major malformation of an extremity was considered when considerable shortening or deformity existed, but limbs with malformation(s) of the fingers or toes only, were not considered as such. Individuals with up to three extremities with major involvement were regarded as one group and those with all four extremities affected by major malformations were grouped together.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the long-term functional results of microvascular toe-to-thumb reconstruction after trauma. Forty-one patients meeting the inclusion criteria were available for a clinical follow-up study. The function of the hand was assessed with questionnaires as well as with modified Tamai and Sollerman hand function tests. According to the questionnaires, most activities were considered easy or quite easy and the majority of the patients (36 / 41) managed with no or minor complaints. Clinical tests showed good recovery of function. Patient satisfaction was high. There were superficial infections in five hands and in six donor feet.

40|$|Mortality and {{morbidity}} are {{increased in}} patients with muscle atrophy resulting from cata-bolic diseases such as diabetes. At present there is no pharmacological treatment that suc-cessfully reverses muscle wasting from catabolic conditions.

Streptozotocin (STZ) was used to induce diabetes in mice. The mice were then treated with Acu-LFES for 15 minutes daily for 14 days. Acupuncture points were selected according to the WHO Standard Acupuncture Nomenclature guide.

40|$|Benefits of {{exercise}} on nerve regeneration and functional recovery {{have been reported}} in both central and peripheral nervous system disease models. However, underlying molecular mechanisms of enhanced regeneration and improved functional outcomes are less understood. We used a peripheral nerve regeneration model that has a good correlation between functional outcomes and number of motor axons that regenerate to evaluate the impact of treadmill exercise. In this model, the median nerve was transected and repaired while the ulnar nerve was transected and prevented from regeneration. Daily treadmill exercise resulted in faster recovery of the forelimb <b>grip</b> <b>function</b> as evaluated by grip power and inverted holding test. Daily exercise also resulted in better regeneration as evaluated by recovery of compound motor action potentials, higher number of axons in the median nerve and larger myofiber size in target muscles. Furthermore, these observations correlated with higher levels of neurotrophic factors, glial derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and insulin-like growth factor- 1 (IGF- 1), in serum, nerve and muscle suggesting that increase in muscle derived neurotrophic factors may be responsible for improved regeneration...|$|E
40|$|During Drosophila embryogenesis, {{developing}} muscles extend growth-cone–like {{structures to}} navigate toward specific epidermal attachment sites. Here, {{we show that}} the homolog of Glutamate Receptor–Interacting Proteins (DGrip) acts as {{a key component of}} proper muscle guidance. Mutations in dgrip impair patterning of ventral longitudinal muscles (VLMs), whereas lateral transverse muscles (LTMs) that attach to intrasegmental attachment sites develop normally. Myoblast fusion, stabilization of muscle contacts, and general muscle function are not impaired in the absence of DGrip. Instead, the proper formation of cellular extensions during guidance fails in dgrip mutant VLMs. DGrip protein concentrates at the ends of VLMs while these muscles guide toward segment border attachment sites. Conversely, LTMs overexpressing DGrip form ectopic cellular extensions that can cause attachment of these muscles to other muscles at segment borders. Our data suggest that DGrip participates in the reception of an attractive signal that emanates from the epidermal attachment sites to direct the motility of developing muscles. This dgrip phenotype should be valuable to study mechanistic principles of <b>Grip</b> <b>function...</b>|$|E

Methods: Twenty four patients received conservative treatment using either the neutral wrist splint or wrist splint with the MCP unit for a period of 6 weeks. Primary outcome measures were pain, <b>function,</b> <b>grip</b> and pinch strength. Data was collected immediately before and after using the two types of splints at baseline (0 weeks) and 6 weeks.
