50|$|Because salary lending was a disreputable trade, {{the owners}} of these firms often hid from public view, hiring {{managers}} to run their offices indirectly.

5|$|By {{the turn}} of the 21st century, Grant had {{established}} himself as a leading man, skilled with a satirical comic talent. Grant has <b>expanded</b> <b>his</b> oeuvre with critically acclaimed turns as a cad in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001), About a Boy (2002), and American Dreamz (2006). Grant later played against type with multiple cameo roles in the epic sci-fi drama film, Cloud Atlas (2012).

5|$|Darwin's first {{literary}} {{project was}} his Journal and Remarks {{on the natural}} history of the expedition, now known as The Voyage of the Beagle. In it he <b>expanded</b> <b>his</b> diary notes into a section on this theory, emphasising how {{the presence or absence of}} coral reefs and atolls can show whether the ocean bed is elevating or subsiding. At the same time he was privately speculating intensively about transmutation of species, and taking on other projects. He finished writing out his journal around the end of September, but then had the work of correcting proofs.|$|E
5|$|Farsari <b>expanded</b> <b>his</b> {{business}} interests into commercial photography and taught himself photography in 1883. In 1885 he formed {{a partnership with}} photographer Tamamura Kozaburō to acquire the Stillfried & Andersen studio (also known as the Japan Photographic Association), which had some 15 Japanese employees. The studio's stock included images by Felice Beato that it had acquired along with Beato's studio in 1877. It {{is not clear how}} long the partnership of Tamamura and Farsari lasted, for within a few years they were in competition with each other. Farsari further <b>expanded</b> <b>his</b> business in 1885 when the Yokohama Photographic Company (owned by David Welsh) folded and Farsari acquired its premises (next door to his own) and moved in. In addition to his Yokohama studio, Farsari likely had agents in Kobe and Nagasaki. By the end of 1886, Farsari and Chinese photographer Tong Cheong were the only foreign commercial photographers still operating in Japan, and by the following year even Tong Cheong had gone.|$|E

Lukather, {{who had been a}} self-taught musician, began taking guitar lessons from Jimmy Wyble. With Wyble, Lukather <b>expanded</b> <b>his</b> knowledge of wider aspects of music, including orchestration. It was during this period in the early 1970s that Lukather became interested in the idea of becoming a session musician, a vocation that provided opportunities to play with a variety of famous musicians.|$|E
5|$|In the 14th century, the {{earliest}} {{examples of the}} use of Taylor series and closely related methods were given by Madhava of Sangamagrama. Though no record of his work survives, writings of later Indian mathematicians suggest that he found a number of special cases of the Taylor series, including those for the trigonometric functions of sine, cosine, tangent, and arctangent. The Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics further <b>expanded</b> <b>his</b> works with various series expansions and rational approximations until the 16th century.|$|E
5|$|In this period, Gaddafi <b>expanded</b> <b>his</b> {{control over}} {{northern}} Chad, building new roads and erecting {{a major new}} airbase, Ouadi Doum, meant to better support air and ground operations beyond the Aouzou Strip.

While this build-up took place, significant elements of the GUNT passed over to the Habré government, as part of the latter's policy of accommodation.|$|E

5|$|Many of Vargas Llosa's {{works are}} {{influenced}} by the writer's perception of Peruvian society and his own experiences as a native Peruvian. Increasingly, however, he has <b>expanded</b> <b>his</b> range, and tackled themes that arise {{from other parts of the}} world. In his essays, Vargas Llosa has made many criticisms of nationalism in different parts of the world. Another change over the course of his career has been a shift from a style and approach associated with literary modernism, to a sometimes playful postmodernism.|$|E
5|$|No {{mention of}} Osorkon IV is known after 716 BC. Some archaeological {{findings}} suggest that shortly after this date, Bocchoris (Bakenrenef) of the 24th Dynasty may have <b>expanded</b> <b>his</b> realm eastward, supplanting Osorkon at Tanis. In 712 BC, Piye's successor Shebitku marched northward and defeated Bocchoris. When around the same year King Iamani of Ashdod sought refuge from Sargon II in Egypt, Shebitku {{was in fact the}} sole ruler of Egypt, and returned Iamani to the Assyrians in chains. In any case, Osorkon IV was seemingly dead before that year.|$|E
