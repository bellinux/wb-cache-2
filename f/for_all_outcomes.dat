40|$|Background: We {{sought to}} {{determine}} from key clinical outcomes whether catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation (AF) is associated with increased survival. Methods and results: Using routinely collected hospital data, ablation patients were matched to two control cohorts using direct and propensity score methodology. Four thousand nine hundred ninety-one ablation patients were matched 1 : 1 with general AF controls without ablation. Five thousand four hundred seven ablation patients were similarly matched to controls who underwent cardioversion. We examined the rates of ischemic stroke or transient ischemic attack (stroke/TIA), heart failure hospitalization, and death. Matched populations had very similar comorbidity profiles, including nearly identical CHA 2 DS 2 -VASc risk distribution (p= 0. 6948 and p= 0. 8152 vs general AF and cardioversion cohorts). Kaplan–Meier models showed increased survival after ablation <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>outcomes</b> compared with both control cohorts (p< 0. 0001 <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>outcomes</b> vs general AF, p= 0. 0087 for stroke/TIA, p< 0. 0001 for heart failure, and p< 0. 0001 for death vs cardioversion). Cox regression models also showed improved survival after ablation <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>outcomes</b> compared with the general AF cohort (hazard ratio [HR]= 0. 4, 95 % confidence interval [95 % CI]: 0. 3 – 0. 6, p< 0. 0001 for stroke/TIA; HR= 0. 4, 95 % CI: 0. 2 – 0. 6, p< 0. 0001 for heart failure; HR= 0. 1, 95 % CI: 0. 1 – 0. 1, p< 0. 0001 for death) and the cardioversion cohort (HR= 0. 6, 95 % CI: 0. 4 – 0. 9, p= 0. 0111 for stroke/TIA; HR= 0. 4, 95 % CI: 0. 3 – 0. 6, p< 0. 0001 for heart failure; HR= 0. 3, 95 % CI: 0. 2 – 0. 5, p< 0. 0001 for death).

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial. SETTING: Specialized rehabilitation centre. SUBJECTS: A total of 170 patients (mean age of 53 years (13); 121 females). INTERVENTIONS: The multidisciplinary group underwent a multidisciplinary rehabilitation programme combining multimodal exercises with psychologist-lead cognitive-behavioural therapy sessions. The general exercise group underwent general physiotherapy. Both groups followed group-based programmes once a week for ten weeks. Additionally, the multidisciplinary group met with the psychologist once a week for a 60 -minute session. MAIN MEASURES: The Neck Disability Index (primary outcome), the Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia, the Pain Catastrophizing Scale, a pain numerical rating scale and the Short-Form Health Survey. The participants were evaluated before, after training and after 12 months. RESULTS: A linear mixed model for repeated measures was used for each outcome measure. Significant effects (p-value < 0. 001) were found over time and between groups <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>outcome</b> measures. After training, significant improvements were found for both groups <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>outcome</b> measures except kinesiophobia and catastrophizing, which did not change in the control group; however, the improvements were significantly greater for the multidisciplinary group.

40|$|Objectives To {{carry out}} a {{critical}} review about educational interventions on community pharmacists, to improve antibiotic dispensing habits and/or behaviours. Methods Review all studies published, from January 2001 to December 2010, about educational interventions in pharmacists to improve antibiotic use in primary care, by searching the scientific MEDLINE database, using PubMed. Data extraction included study design, type of interventions, population targeted, and results of outcomes measured, i. e. changes on total of antibiotic used and/or adherence to guidelines, and, quality of pharmacy practice. Results Our search retrieved seven studies about interventions in pharmacists to improve antibiotic use. In five studies the interventions covered both pharmacists and physicians and were extended to patients and their caregivers or general population. We found only two studies that addressed interventions specifically designed to improve pharmacists’ to combat the dispensing of antibiotics without prescription. Educational interventions included (1) dissemination of printed/audiovisual educational materials (2) group education, including group-session rounds, and (3) individual outreach visits or (4) pamphlets to patients. Results reported by author were positive <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>outcomes</b> measured in five studies, positive for some outcomes and negative for others in two studies and negative <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>outcomes</b> in one study. Conclusions There are few studies published about educational interventions directed specifically to pharmacists, but results in this study indicated that pharmacists practice could be improved with educational interventions and multidisciplinary interventions could improve antibiotic use. Even that, some author stressed the usefulness of including pharmacists in teams tasked with drawing up recommendations and making decisions about antibiotic use in certain countries.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the expression of estrogen receptors (ER(α) and ER(β)) and androgen receptors (ARs) as prognostic factors for biochemical recurrence, disease progression and survival in patients with pT 3 N 0 M 0 prostate cancer (PCa) in an urban Greek population. A total of 100 consecutive patients with pT 3 N 0 M 0 PCa treated with radical prostatectomy participated in the study. The mean age and follow-up were 64. 2 and 6 years, respectively. The HSCORE was used for semi-quantitative analysis of the immunoreactivity of the receptors. The prognostic value of the ER(α) and ER(β) and AR was assessed in terms of recurrence, progression, and survival. AR expression was not associated with any of the above parameters; however, both ERs correlated with the prognosis. A univariate Cox regression analysis showed that ER(α) positive staining was significantly associated with a greater hazard <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>outcomes.</b> Increased ER(β) staining was significantly associated with a lower hazard <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>outcomes</b> in the univariate analysis. When both ER HSCORES were used for the analysis, it was found that patients with high ER(α) or low ER(β) HSCORES compared with patients with negatively stained ER(α) and > 1. 7 hSCORE ER(β) had 6. 03, 10. 93, and 10. 53 times greater hazard for biochemical disease recurrence, progression of disease and death, respectively. Multiple Cox proportional hazard analyses showed that the age, preoperative prostate specific antigen, Gleason score and ERs were independent predictors of all outcomes.

Benefits of superficial heating therapy (SHT) are controversial. Long-term effects of both heating modalities {{have not yet been}} investigated. AIM: To compare the effects of DHT and SHT in patients with symptomatic knee OA, and to determine the long-term effects of heat therapy. DESIGN: Double-blind randomized clinical trial. SETTING: Outpatient clinic of Geriatrics and Physiatrics, University Hospital. POPULATION: Fifty-four patients with radiologically established diagnosis of moderate knee OA (Kellgren-Lawrence grade II or III) and pain lasting for at least three weeks. METHODS: DHT: local microwave diathermy (three 30 -min sessions a week for four weeks); SHT: application of hot packs (three 30 -min sessions a week for four weeks). Primary outcome measure: Western Ontario and McMaster Universities (WOMAC) index for the assessment of joint pain, stiffness and physical function limitations. Secondary outcome measures: British Medical Research Council (BMRC) rating scale for the evaluation of muscle strength, and a visual analogue scale (VAS) for pain assessment. Follow up: 24 weeks <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>outcome</b> measures; 12 months for the primary outcome. RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analyses showed a treatment effect in favor of DHT <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>outcome</b> measures. No clinically relevant changes were observed in the SHT group.

STUDY DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial; Level of evidence, 1. METHODS: Seventy-five patients with a chronic recalcitrant (> 6 months) noninsertional Achilles tendinopathy were enrolled in a {{randomized controlled}} study. All patients had received unsuccessful management for > 3 months, including at least (1) peritendinous local injections, (2) nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and (3) physiotherapy. A computerized random-number generator was used to draw up an allocation schedule. Analysis was on intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: At 4 months from baseline, the Victorian Institute of Sport Assessment (VISA) -A score increased in all groups, from 51 to 76 points in group 1 (eccentric loading), from 50 to 70 points in group 2 (repetitive low-energy SWT), and from 48 to 55 points in group 3 (wait and see). Pain rating decreased in all groups, from 7 to 4 points in group 1, from 7 to 4 points in group 2, and from 8 to 6 points in group 3.
