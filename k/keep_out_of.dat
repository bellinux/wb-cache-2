5|$|Healey I {{advised to}} go to his brother at Bolton, and get some money, and <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight entirely, until {{something}} further was known. His best way would be to avoid Manchester, and go over Kersal moor and Agecroft bridge; and as I had a relation in that quarter who wished to see me, I would keep him company as far as Agecroft.|$|E
5|$|Termites with {{colonies in}} close {{proximity}} to houses can extend their galleries underground and make mud tubes to enter homes. The insects <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> sight and chew their way through structural and decorative timbers, leaving the surface layers intact, as well as through cardboard, plastic and insulation materials. Their presence may become apparent when winged insects appear and swarm in the home in spring. Control and extermination is a professional job involving trying to exclude the insects from the building and trying to kill those already present. Soil-applied liquid termiticides provide a chemical barrier that prevents termites from entering buildings, and lethal baits can be used; these are eaten by foraging insects, and carried back to the nest and shared {{with other members of the}} colony, which goes into slow decline.|$|E
5|$|That same year, Brian Hodgson, who {{had spent}} many years in Nepal serving as the Assistant Resident, and who had a good {{knowledge}} about Nepal's bio-diversity, culture, and politics, became the new British Resident. Although the British Residents were officially instructed to <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the internal politics of Nepal, the Resident was courted by both the King {{as well as the}} Mukhtiyar. Hodgson was waiting for an opportunity to exploit the rift between the Mukhtiyar and the royal family and begin a more aggressive campaign to increase British influence and trading opportunities. Hodgson also believed the large standing army to be a security threat and that the border tensions could be pacified if the King was directly in control, rather than a mukhtiyar who needed to keep {{on the right side of}} the army. By 1834, Hodgson had come to a conclusion that he would not be able to have his way so long as Bhimsen was in control of the Nepalese administration; thus he strongly sympathized with the Pande faction, and he wished to install Fateh Jung Shah, who was more favorably disposed to him, as the mukhtiyar. In August 1834, Hodgson proposed to conduct a new commercial treaty between Nepal and Britain, which Bhimsen in principle agreed to but disagreed with several of the clauses. At a time when his authority was diminishing, Bhimsen could not afford to antagonize the Resident; but at the same time, he could not accept his proposals and be seen as subservient to the British by the Nepalese court. Nevertheless, he tried to maintain a friendly and conciliatory attitude toward the Resident, in order to win him as his ally, by loosening the restrictions on his movements and granting direct access to the King.|$|E

25|$|From the {{inception}} of the violence that began in Syria {{as a result of the}} Arab Spring, the Syrian Civil War has produced and inspired a great deal of strife and unrest among armed factions. Prior to the Battle of Arsal in August 2014, the Lebanese Army has tried to <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it and the violence has been mostly between various factions within the country and overt Syrian involvement has been limited to airstrikes and occasional accidental incursions.|$|E
25|$|In 1790, Clark was {{commissioned}} by General Arthur St. Clair, governor of the Northwest Territory, as a captain in the Clarksville, Indiana militia.

He may have visited New Orleans at that time. His travels prevented him from participating in General Josiah Harmar's disastrous campaign into the Northwest Territory that year.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{convention}} that Whips do not speak in Parliament, Heath managed to <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> {{the controversy over the}} Suez Crisis. On the announcement of Eden's resignation, Heath submitted a report on the opinions of the Conservative MPs regarding Eden's possible successors. This report favoured Harold Macmillan and helped to secure Macmillan the premiership in January 1957. Macmillan later appointed Heath Minister of Labour, a Cabinet Minister—as Chief Whip Heath had attended Cabinet, but had not been formally a member—after winning the October 1959 election.|$|E
25|$|In July 2010, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton {{called for}} the People's Republic of China to resolve the {{territorial}} dispute.

This {{came at a time}} when both countries had been engaging in naval exercises in a show of force to the opposing side, which increased tensions in the region. The US Department of Defense released a statement on August 18 where it opposed the use of force to resolve the dispute, and accused China of assertive behaviour.|$|E

Con men normally moved around to <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> jail, but as Smith's power and gang grew, so did his influence at city hall, allowing him to remain in the city, protected from prosecution. By 1887, he was reputedly involved with most of the criminal bunko activities in the city. Newspapers in Denver reported that he controlled the city's criminals and underworld gambling, and accused corrupt politicians and the police chief of receiving graft from him.|$|E

Scott was Seddon's preferred candidate for the Liberal Party, as {{he was also a}} prohibitionist and would thus draw votes from Tommy Taylor, whom Seddon tried to <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Parliament.|$|E

Both are powerful gangs that frequently injure and kill each other's members as well as suspected informants.|$|E
25|$|Since King John {{now held}} his kingdom as a fief of the Holy See the Pope espoused his cause and excommunicated the barons.

He was released from suspension the following spring on condition that he <b>keep</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> England until peace was restored, and he remained abroad till May 1218. Meanwhile, both Pope Innocent and King John died and all parties in England rallied to the support of Henry III.|$|E
