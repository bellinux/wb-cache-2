5|$|Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often {{occurring}} in its native form, with an iridescent oxide tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of bismuth crystals {{is the result}} of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges. The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal causes different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When burned in oxygen, bismuth burns with a blue flame and its oxide forms yellow fumes.

5|$|It {{has long}} been {{believed}} that a male black-throated blue warbler achieves reproductive maturation well into its first breeding season. A yearling participates in extra-pair mating and cuckoldry as much as or even more than older males. However, research by Graves has found opposing evidence in terms of testicular size and sperm production. Directional asymmetry is present in many passerine birds. The left testicle is often larger in size than the right one, and this holds true for both yearling and older male warblers. However, the testicle to body mass ratio nonetheless <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> in yearlings than in older males. Moreover, older males have {{a greater degree of}} directional asymmetry than do yearlings. Because the size of testes in birds is correlated to the ejaculate quality, it is likely that females employ age-dependent choice in favor of older males who can be distinguished by their definitive age-specific plumage.|$|E
5|$|The 13th-century chancel has two rib vaulted bays, {{making it}} one of only six extant Early English vaulted chancels. Its walls were raised in the 15th century by {{constructing}} a chamber above the vaulting using stone from the demolished 13th-century nave, but, from the outside, this end of the church is still lower than the western section. Internally, the chancel vault <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> than the adjacent nave because of the room above. It has three 15th-century Perpendicular windows down each side, and is notable for the unusual east window with seven stepped lights, a feature found in only two other Early English churches, Lincoln Cathedral and St Martins in Ockham. The chancel contains three simple sedilia, or priest's seats, with trefoil arches and round columns. The sacristry behind the altar has a small lancet window, and the chamber above the chancel, which is floored only by the curved upper surface of the vault below, is lit by a single two-light window.|$|E

5|$|The {{balance between}} the {{oxidized}} and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD/NADH ratio. This ratio {{is an important component}} of what is called the redox state of a cell, a measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health of cells. The effects of the NAD/NADH ratio are complex, controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. In healthy mammalian tissues, estimates of the ratio between free NAD and NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700; the ratio is thus favourable for oxidative reactions. The ratio of total NAD/NADH <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower,</b> with estimates ranging from 3–10 in mammals. In contrast, the NADP/NADPH ratio is normally about 0.005, so NADPH is the dominant form of this coenzyme. These different ratios are key to the different metabolic roles of NADH and NADPH.|$|E
5|$|The pigeye shark is {{a largely}} solitary animal, though {{occasionally}} several individuals {{may be found}} at the same location. In the Mozambique Channel, it outnumbers the bull shark on the east side while the opposite is true on the west side, suggesting there may be competitive exclusion between these similar species. Parasites documented from the pigeye shark include the myxosporean Kudoa carcharhini, the copepods Pandarus smithii and P. cranchii, and the tapeworms Callitetrarhynchus gracilis, Cathetocephalus sp., Floriceps minacanthus, Heteronybelinia australis, Otobothrium australe, O. crenacolle, and Protogrillotia sp. Young pigeye sharks are potentially vulnerable to predation by larger sharks. The natural mortality for juveniles in Cleveland Bay has been measured at no more than 5% per year; this rate is comparable to that in juvenile bull sharks, and <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> than in juvenile blacktip sharks (C. limbatus) or lemon sharks (Negaprion brevirostris).|$|E

5|$|Although {{overall the}} shape of Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} resembles that of the Earth's, closer to the planet its structure is very different. Jupiter's volcanically active moon Io is a strong source of plasma in its own right, and loads Jupiter's magnetosphere with as much as 1,000kg of new material every second. Strong volcanic eruptions on Io emit huge amounts of sulfur dioxide, {{a major part of}} which is dissociated into atoms and ionized by the solar ultraviolet radiation, producing ions of sulfur and oxygen: S+, O+, S2+ and O2+. These ions escape from the satellite's atmosphere and form the Io plasma torus: a thick and relatively cool ring of plasma encircling Jupiter, located near Io's orbit. The plasma temperature within the torus is 10–100eV (100,000–1,000,000K), which <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> than that of the particles in the radiation belts—10keV (100millionK). The plasma in the torus is forced into co-rotation with Jupiter, meaning both share the same period of rotation. The Io torus fundamentally alters the dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere.|$|E
5|$|Early on, paleontologists {{considered}} Macroolithus nests to {{have been}} buried. Mou 1992 noted the high gas conductance values in Macroolithus eggs and therefore concluded that they were laid in a very humid environment, buried underground or inside a mound. Deeming (2006) found a similar result. This seems to contradict evidence that oviraptorosaurids brooded bird-like on their eggs, but Deeming suggested that Oviraptor buried its eggs in a mound and then Oviraptor and its relatives sat atop a nest mound to incubate, rather than directly contacting the eggs. However, Tanaka et al. (2015) criticized these results for lack of statistical rigor. They found, based on comparisons to modern eggs, that Macroolithus was predicted to be laid in open or partially covered nests. Wiemann et al. (2017) also criticized Mou and Deeming because they had only measured eggshell porosity at the middle section of the eggs and did {{not take into account}} the fact that the pore density <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> near the poles. This would lead to an overestimate of the total eggshell porosity and therefore an overstimate of the gas conductance value.|$|E
5|$|Killer {{whales are}} apex predators {{throughout}} their global distribution, and {{can have a}} profound effect on the behavior and population of prey species. Their diet is very broad and they can feed on many vertebrates in the ocean including salmon, rays, sharks (even white sharks), large baleen whales, and nearly 20 species of pinniped. The predation of whale calves may be responsible for annual whale migrations to calving grounds in more tropical waters, where the population of killer whales <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>lower</b> than in polar waters. Prior to whaling, it is thought that great whales were a major food source; however, after their sharp decline, killer whales have since expanded their diet, leading to the decline of smaller marine mammals. A decline in Aleutian Islands sea otter populations in the 1990s was controversially attributed by some scientists to killer whale predation, although with no direct evidence. The decline of sea otters followed a decline in harbor seal and Steller sea lion populations, the killer whale's preferred prey, which in turn may be substitutes for their original prey, now reduced by industrial whaling.|$|E
