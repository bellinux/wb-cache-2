25|$|Although {{the elders}} of the village did not approve and did nothing to help her, Lillinonah nursed the {{stricken}} Englishman through {{all the rest of}} the long, cold winter, seldom leaving his side. As spring came to the encampment of the Pootatucks, he was well along the road to recovery, thanks to the care of his attentive nurse and the good medicine which she had provided. With the blossoming of the mountain laurel on the banks of the Housatonic, love, too, bloomed in the house of Lillinonah. As the beautiful daughter of Waramaug gazed with undisguised affection into the eyes of the man whose life she had saved, she saw that he returned her adoration with unaffected ardor. When summer came, the two young lovers finally decided that they must go to Chief Waramaug, for a love as deep as theirs must be consummated by marriage. The great sachem's reaction, however, was as they both expected: he was very angry. With all the eligible Indian suitors for miles around still beating a path to her door, <b>how</b> <b>dare</b> Lillinonah ask for his blessing on a union with a white man, an unknown stranger whose culture was so different from her own? Was it not true that the paleface despised the Indians, regarding them as little better than the savage beasts of the forest? No, said Waramaug, never would he sanction Lillinonah's marriage to such a man.|$|E
500|$|Helped by the {{speculation}} surrounding Starr's collaborations {{with his former}} bandmates, and by the interest generated by the two Beatles compilations, Ringo was a commercial success, overshadowing Lennon's concurrently released Mind Games. Acknowledging Starr's achievement, Lennon sent him a telegram that read: [...] "Congratulations. <b>How</b> <b>dare</b> you? And please write me a hit song." [...] Lennon pushed for [...] "I'm the Greatest" [...] to be issued as the third single off the album in the United States, but [...] "Oh My My", written by Starr and Vini Poncia, was chosen instead.|$|E

Richardson added that [...] "Andrew loves complicated women, {{and has a}} genius for getting into their psyche and telling the world what makes them tick." [...] Scheduled for release in November 2001, St. Martin's Press added that about 500,000 copies of the first print were ordered, and Morton received a six figure undisclosed amount as advance for writing the book.

She added, [...] "I don't want anyone talking to that snivelling little worm. <b>How</b> <b>dare</b> he invade my privacy?" ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson re-appeared in the {{headlines}} when he and other retired generals, including Major General Tim Cross—who {{was involved in the}} planning effort and later commanded all British troops in Iraq—criticised the American post-war planning for Iraq and attacked the statement by Donald Rumsfeld, US Secretary of Defense, {{at the time of the}} invasion, that the US does not [...] "do nation-building", calling it [...] "nonsensical" [...] and [...] "intellectually bankrupt". Jackson also joined criticism of the British National Party (BNP) in the midst of the 2009 controversy surrounding party leader Nick Griffin's appearance on the panel show Question Time. He accused the BNP of [...] "hijacking" [...] military symbols, saying [...] "the BNP is claiming that it has a better relationship with the Armed Forces than other political parties. <b>How</b> <b>dare</b> they use the image of the Army, in particular, to promote their policies?" [...] He elaborated that it was not a party political issue, but an issue of the armed forces' reputation. Griffin retaliated by calling Jackson and Sir Richard Dannatt [...] "war criminals". A disagreement between Jackson and then Defence Secretary Bob Ainsworth made headlines in 2009, when Ainsworth stated that the UK could only manage a small increase to troop numbers in Afghanistan, saying that the Army had pushed [...] "too hard" [...] when it was engaged in operation in both Iraq and Afghanistan. Jackson countered by saying that the UK should play a decisive role and that the drawdown of troops from Iraq meant the UK had the capability for a larger increase.|$|E

2500|$|Interviewed in 2015 by veteran Irish {{broadcaster}} Gay Byrne, Fry {{was asked}} {{what he would say}} if he came face-to-face with God. Fry said: [...] "Bone cancer in children, what’s that about? <b>How</b> <b>dare</b> you? <b>How</b> <b>dare</b> you create a world where there is such misery that’s not our fault? It’s utterly, utterly evil. [...] Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid God who creates a world which is so full of injustice and pain?" [...] Within days, the video was viewed over five million times. Fry later stated he did not refer to any specific religion, and said: [...] "I said quite a few things that were angry at this supposed God. I was merely saying things that Bertrand Russell and many finer heads of the mind have said for many thousands of years, going {{all the way back to}} the Greeks." [...] Because the God who created this universe, if it was created by God, is quite clearly a maniac, utter maniac.' In May 2017 it was announced that Fry, along with broadcaster RTÉ, were under criminal investigation for blasphemy under the 2009 Defamation Act, following a complaint from a member of the public about the broadcast: the case was dropped after the police confirmed that they had not been able to locate a sufficient number of offended people.|$|E

40|$|Hi – {{my name is}} Mafalda and I am a fan. I {{have been}} a media fan since 1994, when I first {{stumbled}} into fandom via Constance Penley’s 1991 essay "Brownian Motion: Women, Tactics and Technology. " Penley's essay discussed fandom, {{and it was only}} one of the many items on my postgraduate reading list. I do not remember to which seminar the reading was associated: to tell the truth, I do not remember much of the time immediately after Penley’s essay pointed me towards what was to become a large part of my identity, behaviour and social practice. I was too busy chasing fan fiction, attending fan conventions and joining mailing lists. I was bathing in the joy and pain of becoming part of a community of like-minded people, making friends, exercising my creating skills, writing, writing, writing, and talking, talking, talking. However, there was an area of my identity which was more or less off limits to fandom: my being a PhD researcher. As I progressively fell for fandom, I became defensive of it. It was mine, it was niche, it was naughty (yes, slash. Look it up.) As a fan, <b>how</b> <b>dared</b> I make a career of my passion, and maybe in the process “harsh my squee”? <b>How</b> <b>dared</b> I to expose my fellow fans?
