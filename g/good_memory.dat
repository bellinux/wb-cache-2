5|$|The promotional {{phase of}} the {{gameplay}} mainly deals with the idol conversing with various other characters and doing events, {{some of which are}} necessary to progress the game. There are also times when the player is given choices that directly affect the idol. Over the course of a conversation, text progression pauses when the player is given multiple responses to choose from. Depending on which choice is made will effect how well or poorly the communication is received, which results in either bad, normal or good memories. A bad memory will decrease an idol's enthusiasm, which is displayed at certain points throughout gameplay by a horizontal bar in the top-left of the lower screen. An idol's enthusiasm ranges from blue to yellow and finally to red as enthusiasm increases. A normal memory will reward the player with a heart point, used later during auditions. A <b>good</b> <b>memory</b> will reward the player with two heart points and increased enthusiasm. If the player chooses to take the day off, an idol's enthusiasm will automatically increase. Days off also give the idol the chance to either stay at home, or go out into town and meet with other characters. The player can check on days off if there are any presents fans have sent the idols, which contain in-game items.|$|E

25|$|In Müllerian mimicry an {{advantage}} is gained when unpalatable species resemble each other, {{especially when the}} predator has a <b>good</b> <b>memory</b> for colour (as birds, for instance, do have). Thus one trial may work to dissuade a bird from several species of butterfly which all fly the same 'flag'. Brazilian butterflies provide {{some of the most}} extraordinary examples of mimicry, and Müller, Bates and Wallace all had lengthy experience of this. All three traveller-naturalists believed firmly that such systems of mimicry could only come about by means of natural selection, and all of them wrote about it.|$|E

25|$|Organizational memory {{can only}} be applied {{if it can be}} accessed. To make use of it, {{organizations}} must have effective retrieval systems for their archives and <b>good</b> <b>memory</b> recall among the individuals that make up the organization. Its importance to an organization depends upon how well individuals can apply it, a discipline known as experiential learning or evidence-based practice. In the case of individuals' memories, organizational memory's veracity is invariably compromised by the inherent limitations of human memory. Individuals' reluctance to admit to mistakes and difficulties compounds the problem. The actively encouraged flexible labor market has imposed an Alzheimer's-like corporate amnesia on organizations that creates an inability to benefit from hindsight.|$|E

Named after his father, he was always referred to by his middle name of Idwal in his family. Edwards received his initial education at White Gum Valley School, before attending the Fremantle Boy's School where he achieved well academically, although he later claimed {{this was due to}} a <b>good</b> <b>memory</b> rather than high intelligence. However, Edwards was reluctantly forced to leave school at the age of fourteen as the family finances could no longer support him. Described as a [...] "shy, under-confident, introspective and imaginative lad" [...] at this stage in his life, he gained employment as a shipping office clerk.|$|E
500|$|The {{ambulance}} carrying McKinley {{reached the}} Exposition hospital at 4:25p.m. [...] Although it usually dealt {{only with the}} minor medical issues of fairgoers, the hospital did have an operating theatre. [...] At {{the time of the}} shooting, no fully qualified doctor was at the hospital, only nurses and interns. [...] The best surgeon in the city, and the Exposition's medical director, Dr. Roswell Park, was in Niagara Falls, performing a delicate neck operation. [...] When interrupted during the procedure on September 6 to be told he was needed in Buffalo, he responded that he could not leave, even for the President of the United States. [...] He was then told who had been shot. [...] Park, two weeks later, would save the life of a woman who suffered injuries almost identical to McKinley's. [...] The first physician to arrive at the hospital was Dr. Herman Mynter, whom the President had met briefly the previous day; the wounded McKinley (who had a <b>good</b> <b>memory</b> for faces) joked that when he had met Mynter, he had not expected to need his professional services. [...] As McKinley lay on the operating table, he stated of Czolgosz, [...] "He didn't know, poor fellow, what he was doing. [...] He couldn't have known." [...] With Park unavailable and with the fading afternoon light the major source of illumination in the operating room, when another surgeon, Dr. Matthew D. Mann arrived, {{the decision was made to}} operate at once to try to remove the remaining bullet. [...] Mynter had given McKinley an injection of morphine and strychnine to ease his pain; Mann (a noted gynecologist without experience in abdominal wounds) administered ether to sedate McKinley as the wounded man murmured the Lord's Prayer.|$|E

2500|$|Aristotle {{proposed}} that slow-witted people have <b>good</b> <b>memory</b> because the fluids in their brain do not wash away their memory organ used to imprint experiences {{and so the}} [...] "imprint" [...] can easily continue. However, they cannot be too slow or the hardened surface of the organ will not receive new [...] "imprints". He believed {{the young and the}} old do not properly develop an [...] "imprint". Young people undergo rapid changes as they develop, while the elderly's organs are beginning to decay, thus stunting new [...] "imprints". Likewise, people who are too quick-witted are similar to the young and the image cannot be fixed because of the rapid changes of their organ. Because intellectual functions are not involved in memory, memories belong to some animals too, but only those in which have perception of time.|$|E
