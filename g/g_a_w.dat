40|$|This paper {{presents}} an annotated and illustrated catalogue of nominal species-group taxa named by <b>G.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>W.</b> HERRICH-SCHÄFFER in his serial publication “Sammlung neuer oder wenig bekannter aussereuropäischer Schmetterlinge ” (1850 – 1858) for which type material and original specimens {{have recently been}} identified in the collections of the SMNS. The iden-tity of the hitherto unrecognised type specimens, mostly originating from South Africa and Surinam, could be established by original information provided by HERRICH-SCHÄFFER on the wrappers of the separately published coloured plates of the work; information which was not repeated in the main text. The printed text on the wrappers constituting {{an important part of}} the original description by HERRICH-SCHÄFFER has implications for the original generic combination and date of publication of several nominal taxa, which are discussed. For 55 nominal taxa representing 14 Lepidoptera families, syntype specimens could be identified in the SMNS collection. For another five taxa described by other authors and de-picted by HERRICH-SCHÄFFER in the work, the figured specimens could also be located and are listed. For 19 named taxa also supposedly based on SMNS material, no type specimens have been found. All taxa are treated in the catalogue with full bibliographic citations, their type specimens illustrated in colour, and with their taxonomic history and current systematic placement given. The paper also includes some historic remarks about AUGUST KAPPLER, FERDINAND KRAUSS, and CARL VON LUDWIG, as the main suppliers of the specimens con-cerned, and the early curation of the SMNS Lepidoptera collection...|$|E
40|$|The {{atmosphere}} {{has been}} recognized as the major contributor of mercury inputs to terrestrial and aquatic environments. While considerable research on atmospheric concentrations and fluxes of Hg {{has been carried out}} in the Northern Hemisphere, {{this is not the case}} for the Southern hemisphere, remote islands and parts of the open ocean. In this work, atmospheric Hg concentrations and fluxes were determined for locations in South Africa and Bermuda. The concentrations of Hg and other trace metals (Al, Fe, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd and Pb) in precipitation are presented for Pretoria, an urban center and Cape Point, a Global Atmospheric Watch (<b>G.</b> <b>A.</b> <b>W.)</b> site in a nature reserve in South Africa. For Bermuda, Hg concentrations in air, precipitation and particles and deposition fluxes were determined. While these places have distinct differences, these results demonstrate that these locations share similarities in terms of the factors and atmospheric processes that influence deposition. Further, at both locations atmospheric Hg inputs pose a threat to coastal ecosystems, and chemical reactions in the atmosphere enhance the production of reactive gaseous Hg (RGHg) species, which is readily deposited. Additionally, ancillary data and atmospheric back-trajectories help to determine potential sources. Associations between Hg and other trace metals and concentrations of radon (222 Rn) and carbon monoxide (CO) help to determine the relative strength of anthropogenic influences at the South African sites. The role of particles and chemical processes that enhance inputs to the coastal ecosystem in Bermuda are discussed, Finally, the importance of sampling and analytical methods 2 ̆ 6 procedures in Hg research and indeed all trace metal research is demonstrated through participation in an international inter-comparison exercise under the GEOTRACES program...|$|E
