Weight management–A multifaceted issue Being overweight is a complex condition consisting of biological, psychological, and social factors. Most diets for reducing weight can successfully lead to weight loss; however, body weight often is regained after overeating in response to limiting calories. Few individuals achieve permanent weight loss from current approaches. The hazards of dieting and weight cycling are of growing concern. Successful weight management involves many factors– physiology, genetics, social support, culture, health...|$|E
40|$|Welcome to Tampa and to 2009 ! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> {{are on a}} treadmill? Is {{your head}} spinning? It is a new year, {{the economy has been}} {{spiraling}} downward faster and deeper than we could have ever imagined, we have a new President, and significant legislation is being passed at a rapid rate. The last few minutes of the Super Bowl (held here in Tampa, of course) may be a metaphor for what is happening – rapid changes in who was winning and just when it looked like something was decided, something else happened. I am a big fan of complexity theory and it cautions about overly simplified views of how predictable the world is but this is getting ridiculous. Wow – no wonder I am tired and a little disoriented! Hopefully during your stay here in Tampa we can provide you with a chance to catch your breath and enjoy some good weather, and with an opportunity to network with other very dedicated people who share your interests in systems of care, children’s mental health, research, and evaluation. I am a little worried, though.

40|$|When {{you teach}} Introduction to Psychology, {{do you find}} it {{difficult}} — much harder than teaching classes in statistics or research methods? Do you easily give a lecture on the sympathetic nervous system, a lecture on Piaget, and a lecture on social cognition, but struggle with linking these topics together for the student? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> <b>you</b> are presenting a laundry list of research findings rather than an integrated set of principles and knowledge? Have you wondered how to ensure your course is relevant to your students? If so, then you have something in common with Charles Stangor. Charles Stangor's Introduction to Psychology utilizes the dual theme of behavior and empiricism to make psychology relevant to intro students. Charles wrote this book to help students organize their thinking about psychology at a conceptual level. Five or ten years from now, he does not expect his students to remember the details of most of what he teaches them. However, he does hope that they will remember that psychology matters because it helps us understand behavior and that our knowledge of psychology is based on empirical study. This book is designed to facilitate these learning outcomes, and he has used three techniques to help focus students on behavior: Chapter Openers: Each chapter opens showcasing an interesting real world example of people who dealing with behavioral questions and who can use psychology to help them answer them. The opener is designed to draw the student into the chapter and create an interesting in learning about the topic. Psychology in Everyday Life: Each chapter contains one or two features designed to link the principles from the chapter to real-world applications in business, environment, health, law, learning, and other relevant domains. For instance, the application in Chapter 7 on Development, ”What makes good parents“ applies the concepts of parenting styles in a mini-handbook about parenting, and the application in Chapter 3 is about the difficulties that left-handed people face performing everyday tasks in a right-handed world. Research Foci: Introduction to Psychology emphasizes empiricism throughout, but without making it a distraction from the main story line. Each chapter presents two close-ups on research [...] well articulated and specific examples of research within the content area, each including a summary of the hypotheses, methods, results, and interpretations. This feature provides a continuous thread that reminds students of the importance of empirical research. The research foci also emphasize the fact that findings are not always predictable ahead of time (dispelling the myth of hindsight bias), and also help students understand how research really works. Charles Stangor's focus on behavior and empiricism has produced, Introduction to Psychology, a text that is better organized, has fewer chapters, and is somewhat shorter than many of the leading books.

This study was conducted to understand the community that we will be working with, in relation to mentoring programs that have proved to be successful such as Compass 2 Campus. In order to better serve the community, we investigated perceptions of individuals about the education system. Wapato School District met criteria for low academic achievement and then community mapping was done to get more details. Two community members were interviewed and questions such as the following were posed: What is your perception of the schools in Wapato? How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> about school administrators and teachers helping out students? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> the school is helping students with their postsecondary education plans? Pictures of the community were taken within a six-block radius of the school and the community park. Statistics were gathered from Office of Superintendent for Public Instruction (OSPI).

5000|$|France and Great Britain {{declared}} war in 1744 {{in what was}} known as King George's War in the American Colonies. The colonies in New France, {{in what is now}} Canada were protected by the Fortress of Louisburg. The Fortress also served as a base of attack against British colonial interests, especially Gibson's shipping interests in the Atlantic and his property in Maine. With the British and French Fleets engaged with one another in the Caribbean, William Shirley, the Governor of Massachusetts, had proposed that the Colony raise its own militia and fleet and take Louisburg by surprise. Gibson notes that when Shirley first presented his proposal to the General Court in Boston, it was rejected. However, the Governor knew Gibson [...] "to be a man of weighty character, as well as weighty purse" [...] and visited him in his [...] "counting room, and abruptly said, 'Gibson, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>feel</b> <b>like</b> giving up the expedition to Louisburg?'"
