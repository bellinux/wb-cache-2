Flannery said of the episode, [...] "We shot some really fun stuff with Steve and the ladies just running around the mall. The food-court scene was so much fun. Steve is an amazing actor." [...] Lingerie retailer Victoria's Secret agreed to close their store {{to the public for}} filming. In the episode, Angela reveals that she wears large sizes of clothes purchased from American Girl, a doll store chain, but will not shop at children's retailer Gap <b>Kids</b> <b>because</b> it is [...] "too flashy." [...] In the DVD audio commentary, Kinsey remarked that after the episode broadcast, people would bring up American Girl Doll catalogs for her to sign.

2500|$|Whedon always {{intended}} for the character to become an icon, claiming [...] "I {{wanted her to be}} a hero that existed in people's minds the way Wonder Woman or Spider-Man does, you know? I wanted her to be a doll or an action figure. I wanted Barbie with Kung Fu grip! I wanted her to enter the mass consciousness and the imaginations of growing <b>kids</b> <b>because</b> I think she's a cool character, and that was always the plan. I wanted Buffy to be a cultural phenomenon, period." [...] In developing Buffy, Whedon was greatly inspired by Kitty Pryde, a character from the pages of the superhero comic X-Men. He admits, [...] "If there's a bigger influence on Buffy than Kitty, I don't know what it was... She was an adolescent girl finding out she has great power and dealing with it." [...] In a 2009 interview, Whedon revealed he only recently realised how much he saw of himself in Buffy. After years of relating more to Xander, he says, [...] "Buffy was always the person that I was in that story because I'm not in every way." [...] Whedon openly wonders why his identification figure is a woman, but describes it as [...] "a real autobiographical kind of therapy for me" [...] to be writing a strong female character like Buffy.|$|E
2500|$|British {{director}} Brian Grant {{was hired}} to direct Summer's video for [...] "She Works Hard for the Money". The video was a success, being nominated for MTV Music Video Awards for Best Female Video and Best Choreography; Summer {{became one of the}} first black artists, and the first African-American Female Artist to have her video played in heavy rotation on MTV. Grant would also be hired to direct Summer's Costa Mesa HBO concert special, A Hot Summers Night. Grant who was a fan of the song State of Independence had an idea for a grand finale. He wanted a large chorus of children to join Summer on stage at the ending of the song. His team looked for local school children in Orange County, to create a chorus of 500 students. On the final day of rehearsals, the kids turned up and they had a full rehearsal. [...] According to Grant, [...] "It looked and sounded amazing. It was a very emotional, very tearful experience for everyone who was there." [...] He thought if this was that kind of reaction in rehearsal, then what an impact it would have in the concert. After the rehearsal Grant was informed that he could not use the <b>kids</b> <b>because</b> the concert would end after 10 pm; children could not be licensed to be on stage at such a late hour (California had strict child labor laws in 1983). [...] "It's a moment that I regret immensely: a grand finale concept I came up with that couldn't be filmed in the end". When the final sequence was filmed, Summer's daughter Mimi and her family members joined her on stage for [...] "State of Independence".|$|E

2500|$|In 1969 Burton {{enjoyed a}} {{commercial}} blockbuster with Clint Eastwood in the World War II action film Where Eagles Dare; {{he received a}} $1million fee plus {{a share of the}} film's box office gross. According to his daughter Kate Burton, “He did that one for us <b>kids,</b> <b>because</b> we kept asking him, 'Can you do a fun movie that we can go see?" [...] Eastwood [...] thought the script [...] "terrible" [...] and was [...] "all exposition and complications". He asked the film's producer Elliott Kastner and its screenwriter Alistair MacLean to be given less dialogue, later remarking [...] "I just stood around firing my machine gun while Burton handled the dialogue." [...] Burton enjoyed working with Eastwood and said of the picture that he [...] "did all the talking and [...] did all the killing". Burton's last film of the decade, Anne of the Thousand Days (1969) for which he was paid $1.25million, was commercially successful but garnered mixed opinions from reviewers. Noted British film critic Tom Milne of Time Out magazine believed that Burton [...] "plays throughout on a monotonous note of bluff ferocity". Conversely, Vincent Canby of The New York Times appreciated Burton's portrayal of the English monarch, noting that he [...] "is in excellent form and voice—funny, loutish and sometimes wise". Anne of the Thousand Days received ten nominations at the 42nd Academy Awards, including one for Burton's performance as Henry VIII of England, which many thought to be largely the result of an expensive advertising campaign by Universal Studios. The same year, Staircase in which he and his [...] "Cleopatra" [...] co-star Rex Harrison appeared as a bickering homosexual couple, received negative reviews and was unsuccessful.|$|E
