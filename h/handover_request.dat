30|$|The MRO is a SON {{function}} {{designed to}} guarantee proper mobility, i.e., proper handover in connected mode and cell re-selection in idle mode. Among the specific goals of this function, {{we have the}} minimization of call drops, the reduction of radio link failure (RLF), the minimization of unnecessary handovers and ping pongs due to poor handover parameters settings, and the minimization of idle problems. Its implementation is commonly distributed. The messages containing useful information are, e.g., the S 1 AP <b>handover</b> <b>request</b> or X 2 AP <b>handover</b> <b>request,</b> the handover report, and the RLF indication/report. MRO operates over connected mode and idle mode parameters. In connected mode, it tunes meaningful handover trigger parameters, such as the event A 3 offset (when referring to intra-RAT, intra-carrier handovers), the time to trigger (TTT), or the layer 1 and layer 3 filter coefficients. In idle mode, it tunes the offset values, such as the Qoffset for the intra-RAT, intra-carrier case. CCO is a SON function, which aims to provide capacity and coverage optimization. The targets that can be optimized may be vendor dependent and include coverage, cell throughout, edge cell throughput, or a weighted combination of the above.|$|E

As the probability of <b>handover</b> <b>requests</b> is directly proportional to the mobile velocity, the handover response should be made dependent on mobile velocity to avoid unwanted call termination and early handover for high and low velocity vehicles respectively. Due to the dependency of handover performance to path loss exponent, a variable hysteresis scheme has already been proposed. As the handover performance is highly dependent on user velocity, if the hysteresis margin is made adaptive and varied dynamically in a complimentary manner with mobile velocity, the call termination as well as unnecessary handover may be minimized for high and low velocity mobiles respectively. In this work, a variable hysteresis margin based handover scheme is thus proposed and studied which takes care of both path loss exponent and mobile velocity.

40|$|Abstract — Several low {{earth orbit}} (LEO) {{satellite}} constellations have been proposed for mobile satellite systems (MSS’s). Due to nonstationary coverage regions of individual LEO satellites, the offered traffic load for each cell varies continuously. The variation of the traffic load essentially requires dynamic channel assignment. Furthermore, extremely frequent <b>handover</b> <b>requests</b> require specific techniques that prioritize the service of <b>handover</b> <b>requests.</b> In this paper, we suggest a new dynamic channel assignment (DCA) scheme which eliminates forced call terminations due to handover failure (call dropping). This scheme utilizes frequency spectrum efficiently, and can also provide users a high-quality premium service that guarantees the success of each handover procedure, called guaranteed handover service. This is based on position measurement. Finally, we compare our algorithm with some other DCA algorithms by computational experiments. The results of experiments show that our algorithm provides systems higher throughput (higher completed call ratio) as well as guaranteed handovers...|$|R

40|$|A novel {{approach}} to handover management for LTE femtocells is presented. Within LTE, {{the use of}} Self Organizing Networks is included as standard and handover management {{is one of its}} use cases. Base stations can autonomously decide whether handover should take place and assign the values of relevant parameters. Due to the limited range of femtocells, handover requires more delicate attention in an indoor scenario to allow for efficient and seamless handover from indoor femtocells to outdoor macrocells. As a result of the complexities of the indoor radio environment, frequent ping-pong handovers between the femtocell and macrocell layers can occur. A novel approach requiring a small amount of additional processing using neural networks is presented. A modified Self Organizing Map is used to allow the femtocell to learn the locations of the indoor environment from where <b>handover</b> <b>requests</b> have occurred and, based on previous experience, decide whether to permit or prohibit these handovers. Once the regions that coincide with unnecessary handovers have been detected, the algorithm can reduce the total number of handovers that occur by up to 70 % while still permitting any necessary <b>handover</b> <b>requests</b> to proceed. By reducing the number of handovers, the system's overall efficiency will improve as the consequence of a reduction in associated but unnecessary signaling.

This paper gives the analysis of earlier approaches to efficient data transfer among BSs during handover and gives two new approaches for efficient data transfer to overcome the drawbacks of the previous approach. Learning that frequent User Equipment (UE) polling causes too much load on uplink network, it is suggested that a single poll to UE on <b>handover</b> <b>request</b> is sufficient to transfer data efficiently with one poll delay time.

We envisage such move within the paradigm of Functionality as a Service (FaaS); a platform that can also deliver requirements of the 5 th generation mobile, i. e. 5 G. In this paper, we briefly explain architectural elements of mobile networks that can materialize the FaaS platform, and discuss the mobility management within the FaaS platform. Relying on these architectural elements, we propose modelling the dynamics of mobile network topology, including fixed base stations and mobile users, as a self-regulatory network. Therefore, users ’ mobility is provisioned and traffic flow is moved to the next point of attachment, i. e. the next base station, with no <b>handover</b> <b>request</b> from the mobile device. Clearly, there is a trade-off between keeping the abstract model up-to-date and the increased overhead of the updates. Hence, we further {{examine the effect of}} such out-of-date and insufficient information in the abstraction. The investigations are carried out in network simulator (ns- 3) and it can be seen while reducing frequency of updates results in the increased packet loss, an optimal balance between overhead and packet loss can be achieved.

It is expected that these systems utilise multiple radio access technologies, seamlessly integrated to form a heterogeneous wireless access network, thus enabling total ubitiqous computing. On {{the arrival of a}} service request from a smart space user or device, the network operator must assign one of the available access networks. Selecting the network that has the highest probability of providing the best Quality of Service (QoS) for a particular service type is an important consideration for overall network stability and QoS provisioning. In this paper we present aspects of intelligent radio resource management based on policy based call admission control to select the best available network and fuzzy logic based intersystem handover control. The admission controller admits a new user based on the current load and service mix in each available network. Inter-system handover involves users changing connectivity from one access technology to another. Inter-system handover initiation can be due to reduced QoS, cost of connection, network availability or user context such as characteristics of user mobility.

30|$|Two {{more power}} schemes, which {{represent}} the second approach, are introduced in [15, 16]. In [15], the authors propose an adaptive coverage adjustment (ACA) algorithm. The {{aim of the}} paper {{is similar to the}} self-optimization schemes proposed in [12, 13], that is, to minimize mobility events and to reduce signal leakage. If the UE currently attached to the MBS is in close vicinity of a FAPs, the FAPs itself iteratively decreases its transmit power as long as the passing UE is in FAPs range. After specific time period when the UE moves away from the FAPs coverage, the FAPs increases power to the initial value. Nevertheless, this scheme is not able to fully mitigate the redundant handovers, since the decrease of power is done after reception of <b>handover</b> <b>request</b> at the side of FAPs. In [16], self-optimization scheme allowing the FAPs to adaptively adjust transmitting power is presented. The proposed scheme is composed of two steps. In the first step, the self-configuration of the FAPs transmitting power is accomplished. In the second step, the adaptation of current transmitting power according to radio environments obtained by measurements is performed. The aim of the authors is like as described in [12, 13], that is, to minimize interference caused by the FAPs to passersby users while to achieve sufficient indoor coverage. However, the authors do not use the number of generated mobility events but consider leakage of the FAPs signal for its power adaptation.|$|E

Avoiding such interference {{is very important for}} the co-existence of femtocells within a macrocell. In this paper, we use simple handover strategy between the macrocell and the femtocell to alleviate the problem of cross-tier interference from open access femtocells. The handover to an interfering femtocell is performed only when the femtocell contains unutilised resources having very little or no level of downlink interference to serve the macrocell user. In order {{to deal with the problem}} of increased number of handovers associated with the open access femtocells, a timer with a minimum and a maximum value is proposed in every macrocell user. The macrocell user measures the RSS (received signal strength) from the nearby interfering femtocells, and starts the timer from 0 to the minimum value as soon as the RSS from the femtocells become greater than the RSS from the macrocell. Once the timer expires, the macrocell user checks the RSS from the interfering femtocells. If the RSS from the interfering femtocells is still high, the macrocell user again starts the timer from 0 to the maximum value. After the timer expires, the macrocell user again checks the RSS from the interfering femtocells. If the RSS is high, the macrocell user requests a handover.
