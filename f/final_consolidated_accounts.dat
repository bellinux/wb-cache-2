This is the task of the parent company who keeps the <b>consolidated</b> <b>accounts.</b> To accomplish its goals, the <b>consolidated</b> <b>accounting</b> uses a couple of, so-called, consolidation techniques. These are applied in the case of groups of companies with a complex structure. Their goal is to elaborate the consolidated financial statements using a set of methods and empirical skills. In this article we synthetize and apply the consolidation techniques in the view of Romanian accounting regulations. The Romanian practice has revealed, especially, two techniques: one based on direct consolidation and another one based on multiple levels (phased consolidation). Therefore, this work regards only the technical side of <b>consolidated</b> <b>accounting,</b> accounting records being evaded. Furthermore, we focus only on the preparation of the consolidated balance sheet in the case of some hypothetical groups of companies...|$|R

40|$|<b>Consolidated</b> <b>accounting</b> for {{corporations}} in Spain was rare before the Seventh European Directive, {{adopted by the}} European Union in 1983, and only became compulsory in 1991. During the intervening years a number of firms elected to adopt <b>consolidated</b> <b>accounting</b> {{even though they were}} not required to do so. These circumstances provide a useful insight into the early adoption of accounting practices as, in contrast with most previous studies of early adoption, (a) many firms adopted the accounting techniques well in advance of the required date, (b) consolidation makes a substantial impact on reported financial statements, and (c) the effect of consolidation can be beneficial or adverse. We find that those firms which adopted <b>consolidated</b> <b>accounting</b> early reported a significantly better change in reported performance at the time of adoption than those firms which only consolidated when required to do so. Firms that are subject to government regulation also tended to adopt early but the impact of consolidation on reported performance was not beneficial for regulated early adopters. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show that, long before the French groups begin to publish <b>consolidated</b> <b>accounts,</b> American {{regulations}} have influenced the thinking of French accountants on the subject in the early 1960 s. In <b>consolidating</b> <b>accounts</b> in France, is the pioneering study by Richard and Veyrenc in 1954 that initiates the discussion of the issue of the consolidated balance sheets. The study, Consolidated Balance sheets, income from business groups was presented at the annual conference of the National Society of Accountants in Dijon in 1954, will be widely quoted and discussed in the professional literature until 1964. This paper seeks to highlight the genesis of this seminal text on the <b>consolidated</b> <b>accounts.</b> Richard and Veyrenc where did they get their inspiration? It’s in the minutes of a mission productivity with which they participated in the United States in April-May 1951 we find the answer. So it is interesting to revisit the report of the mission to seek productivity measure the contributions of two French accountants in their communication of 1954. According to a comparative report of the mission productivity and communication of Richard and Veyrenc that there are many similarities reading. Consequently, the influence of the task productivity of Accountants of April-May 1951 was instrumental in the establishment of a reflection on consolidation of accounts in France. Thus, even before the French company at the head of a group begin to publish <b>consolidated</b> <b>accounts</b> (late 1960), the literature on the issue of consolidation already broadcasts during the 1950 Anglo-Saxon methodology...|$|R

This directive amend the Fourth and Seventh Company Directives, the Accounting Directives, regarding {{the information that}} Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SME) have to present in notes connected to both the annual reports and notes to the <b>consolidated</b> <b>accounts,</b> in situations with subsidiaries when its necessary to draw up <b>consolidated</b> <b>accounts.</b> The Accounting Directives does not affect all companies, almost only private limited liability companies, is this type of companies the only one discussed. Directive 2009 / 49 /EC is not affecting all sizes of private limited liability companies within the European Union, since {{the most important reason}} for implementing it is to give SMEs less administrative burden by lower requirements regarding the information presented in notes attached to the reports. The implementation of Directive 2009 / 49 EC is a positive change since it is in line with the idea of an Internal Market with equal rights and obligations to all sized of limited liability companies, private or public. The lower obligations in the annual reports in the Fourth Directive are for SMEs to the better because of the less administrative burden and the loss of information for interested is not more important, but of course, for some it is crucial. Amending the Seventh Directive may have larger effect to some companies, most likely medium-sized SMEs, since the obligation to draw <b>consolidated</b> <b>accounts</b> will for some companies not be necessary...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the implications}} of the EUs proposal to permit large multi-national corporations (global players) to present their <b>consolidated</b> <b>accounts</b> in accordance with the IASs of the IASC. After an analysis of the problems faced by both the EU and the global players, it considers the chances of the EU and the IASC reaching agreement. A major problem is identified as being that the IASC is dominated by the Anglo-American approach to financial reporting which is fundamentally different from the Continental European approach followed in the EUs directives. It is felt that a compromise might be achieved if both the EU and the IASC agreed to restrict the application of IASs to the <b>consolidated</b> <b>accounts</b> of the global players. Finally the position of the American SEC is considered {{in the light of the}} IASC-IOSCO agreement. The paper concludes that it is improbable that the SEC will accept the IASs for listing purposes on Wall Street. ...|$|R
