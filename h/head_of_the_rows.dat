5000|$|Sightline {{criteria}} in theaters can include: the [...] "isacoustic curve" [...] defined by John Scott Russell in 1838 and applied at the Auditorium Building in Chicago and the Emery Theatre in Cincinnati; alternate row sightlines where each patron sees between <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> patrons in <b>the</b> <b>row</b> {{in front and}} over <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> patrons in <b>the</b> second <b>row</b> in front; next row sightlines where each patron sees over <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> patrons in <b>the</b> <b>row</b> immediately in front; and basic considerations like pointing the chairs more or less toward the performance, {{being able to see}} the conductor in the pit, being able to see other patrons, being able to see actors on elevated scenery, and not being obstructed by a wall, railing, column, ceiling overhang, loudspeaker cluster, or any other obstruction. <b>The</b> design <b>of</b> sightlines includes considerations of how much <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stage and scenery each patron can see. For example, can each patron see <b>the</b> top <b>of</b> <b>the</b> scenery or not, and can each patron see the whole stage floor or not? Design of sightlines is divided into two related exercises, vertical sightlines and horizontal sightlines. Design of proper sightlines includes resolving both technical and aesthetic issues. At issue is <b>the</b> emotional response <b>of</b> <b>the</b> audience: whether a performer can hold the audience's attention or not; whether the patron feels they had a [...] "good" [...] seat and their ticket was fairly priced or not; whether the audience gets <b>the</b> emotional impact <b>of</b> <b>the</b> performance or not; and whether the patron wants to come back and see another performance in that theater or not. Building codes restrict the maximum and minimum rise per <b>row,</b> limit <b>the</b> minimum width per <b>row,</b> limit <b>the</b> maximum deviation in <b>the</b> size <b>of</b> steps from row to <b>row</b> to achieve <b>the</b> curvature <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rake, and limit other aspects of sightline design.|$|R
