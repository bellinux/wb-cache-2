5|$|One type of {{sympatric}} speciation involves crossbreeding of two related species {{to produce a}} new hybrid species. This is not common in animals as animal hybrids are usually sterile. This is because during meiosis the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> from each parent are from different species and cannot successfully pair. However, it {{is more common in}} plants because plants often double their number of chromosomes, to form polyploids. This allows the chromosomes from each parental species to form matching pairs during meiosis, since each parent's chromosomes are represented by a pair already. An example of such a speciation event is when the plant species Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa crossbred to give the new species Arabidopsis suecica. This happened about 20,000 years ago, and the speciation process has been repeated in the laboratory, which allows the study of the genetic mechanisms involved in this process. Indeed, chromosome doubling within a species may be a common cause of reproductive isolation, as half the doubled chromosomes will be unmatched when breeding with undoubled organisms.|$|E
25|$|Nondisjunction is {{the failure}} of <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> or sister chromatids to {{separate}} properly during cell division. There are three forms of nondisjunction: failure {{of a pair of}} <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> to separate in meiosis I, failure of sister chromatids to separate during meiosis II, and failure of sister chromatids to separate during mitosis. Nondisjunction results in daughter cells with abnormal chromosome numbers (aneuploidy).|$|E
25|$|The {{most widely}} used banding methods are G-banding (Giemsa-banding) and R-banding (reverse-banding). These {{techniques}} produce a characteristic pattern of contrasting dark and light transverse bands on the chromosomes. Banding {{makes it possible to}} identify <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> and construct chromosomal nomenclatures for many species. Banding of <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> allows chromosome segments and rearrangements to be identified. The banded karyotypes of 850 mammalian species were summarized in the Atlas of Mammalian Chromosomes.|$|E
40|$|Mapping {{expressed}} sequence tags (ESTs) to {{hexaploid wheat}} is aimed {{to reveal the}} structure and function of the hexaploid wheat genome. Sixty eight ESTs representing 26 genes were mapped into all seven <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> groups of wheat (Triticum aestivum L) using a polymerase chain reaction technique. The majority of the ESTs were mapped to <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> group 2, and the least were mapped to <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> group 6. Comparative analysis between the EST map from this study and the EST map based on RFLPs showed 14 genes that have been mapped by both approaches were mapped to the same arm of the same <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome,</b> which indicated that using PCR-based ESTs was a reliable approach in mapping ESTs in hexaploid wheat...|$|R
5000|$|Homing {{endonuclease}} genes (HEGs) cleave DNA {{at its own}} site on the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome,</b> triggering the DNA double-stranded break repair system, which [...] "repairs" [...] {{the break}} by copying the HEG onto the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome.</b> HEGs have been characterized in yeast, and can only survive by passing between multiple isolated populations or species.|$|R
5000|$|Alternatively, a {{crossover}} {{can occur}} during DNA repair [...] if, due to extensive damage, the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> is {{chosen to be}} the template over the sister chromatid. This leads to gene synthesis since one copy of the allele is copied across from the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> and then synthesized into the breach on the damaged chromosome. The net effect {{of this would be}} one heterozygous chromosome and one homozygous chromosome.|$|R
25|$|The term homoeologous, also spelled homeologous, {{is used to}} {{describe}} the relationship of similar chromosomes or parts of chromosomes brought together following inter-species hybridization and allopolyploidization, and whose relationship was completely homologous in an ancestral species. In allopolyploids, the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> within each parental sub-genome should pair faithfully during meiosis, leading to disomic inheritance; however in some allopolyploids, the homoeologous chromosomes of the parental genomes may be nearly as similar to one another as the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> leading to tetrasomic inheritance (four chromosomes pairing at meiosis), intergenomic recombination, and reduced fertility.|$|E
25|$|SAC {{inhibits}} progression into anaphase {{until all}} <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> (bivalents, or tetrads) are properly aligned to the spindle apparatus. Only then, SAC releases its inhibition of the anaphase promoting complex (APC), {{which in turn}} irreversibly triggers progression through anaphase.|$|E
25|$|Polysomy {{is usually}} caused by {{non-disjunction}} (the {{failure of a}} pair of <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> to separate) during meiosis, but may also be due to a translocation mutation (a chromosome abnormality caused by rearrangement of parts between nonhomologous chromosomes). Polysomy is found in many diseases, including Down syndrome in humans where affected individuals possess three copies (trisomy) of chromosome 21.|$|E
40|$|Meiosis is {{essential}} for eukaryotic sexual reproduction and important for genetic diversity among indivi-duals. Although a number of genes regulating <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> pairing and synapsis {{have been identified in}} the plant kingdom, their molecular basis remains poorly understood. In this study, we identified a novel gene, PAIR 3 (HOMOLOGOUS PAIRING ABERRATION IN RICE MEIOSIS 3), required for <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> pairing and synapsis in rice. Two independent alleles, designated pair 3 - 1 and pair 3 - 2, were identified in our T-DNA insertional mutant library which could not form bivalents due to failure of <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> pairing and synapsis at diakinesis, resulting in sterility in both male and female gametes. Suppression of PAIR 3 by RNAi produced similar results to the T-DNA insertion lines. PAIR 3 encodes a protein that contains putative coiled-coil motifs, but does not have any close homologs in other organisms. PAIR 3 is preferentially expressed in reproductive organs, especially in pollen mother cells and the ovule tissues during meiosis. Our results suggest that PAIR 3 plays a crucial role in <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> pairing and synapsis in meiosis...|$|R
50|$|Current {{and future}} {{research}} {{on the subject of}} <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> is heavily focused on the roles of various proteins during recombination or during DNA repair. In a recently published article by Pezza et al. the protein known as HOP2 is responsible for both <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> synapsis as well as double-strand break repair via homologous recombination. The deletion of HOP2 in mice has large repercussions in meiosis. Other current studies focus on specific proteins involved in homologous recombination as well.|$|R

25|$|The term {{is used to}} {{describe}} the relationship of similar chromosomes that pair at mitosis and meiosis. In a diploid, one homolog is derived from the male parent (sperm) and one is derived from the female parent (egg). During meiosis and gametogenesis, <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> pair and exchange genetic material by recombination, leading to the production of sperm or eggs with chromosome haplotypes containing novel genetic variation.|$|E
25|$|Microsatellite {{mutation}} rates {{vary with}} base position {{relative to the}} microsatellite, repeat type, and base identity. Mutation rate rises specifically with repeat number, peaking around six to eight repeats and then decreasing again. Increased heterozygosity in a population will also increase microsatellite mutation rates, especially {{when there is a}} large length difference between alleles. This is likely due to <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> with arms of unequal lengths causing instability during meiosis.|$|E
25|$|Some {{animal and}} plant species are {{polyploid}} : They have more than two sets of <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> Plants important in agriculture such as tobacco or wheat are often polyploid, compared to their ancestral species. Wheat has a haploid number of seven chromosomes, still seen in some cultivars {{as well as the}} wild progenitors. The more-common pasta and bread wheat types are polyploid, having 28 (tetraploid) and 42 (hexaploid) chromosomes, compared to the 14 (diploid) chromosomes in the wild wheat.|$|E
40|$|Contrabithorax (Cbx) alleles are {{dominant}} {{mutations in}} the Ultrabithorax (Ubx) gene of Drosophila that cause its ectopic {{expression in the}} mesothorax. We have studied {{the role of the}} <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> in the mesothoracic phenotype in several Cbx heterozygotes. None of the Cbx alleles studied shows variations in phenotype with extra doses of the Ubx gene. Only Cbx 2 and CbxIRM (a revertant of Cbx 1) show synapsis-dependent gene expression ("transvection"). The mesothoracic phenotypes of CbxIRM and Cbx 2 heterozygotes are strongly modified when the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> carries breakpoints proximal to or at the Ubx locus or null alleles of this gene. These lesions in the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> enhance the Cbx 2 mutant phenotype and reduce that of CbxIRM one.

5000|$|DNA {{crosslinks}} generally cause loss {{of overlapping}} sequence {{information from the}} two strands of DNA. Therefore, accurate repair of the damage depends on retrieving the lost information from an undamaged <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> in the same cell. Retrieval can occur by pairing with a sister chromosome produced during a preceding round of replication. In a diploid cell retrieval may also occur by pairing with a non-sister <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome,</b> as occurs especially during meiosis.

30|$|Moreover, yeast B-type cyclins (CLB 5 and CLB 6) {{have been}} {{reported}} to have key roles in the initiation of <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> recombination and the formation of synaptonemal complex during meiosis prophase (Devault et al., 2008; Henderson et al., 2006).|$|R
25|$|A {{bivalent}} is {{the association}} of two replicated <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> having exchanged DNA strand {{in at least one}} site called chiasmata. Each bivalent contains a minimum of one chiasma and rarely more than three. This limited number (much lower than the number of initiated DNA breaks) is due to crossover interference, a poorly understood phenomenon that limits the number of resolution of repair events into crossover in the vicinity of another pre-existing crossover outcome, thereby limiting the total number of crossovers per homologs pair.|$|E
25|$|A {{genetic map}} is a map {{based on the}} {{frequencies}} of recombination between markers during crossover of <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes.</b> The greater the frequency of recombination (segregation) between two genetic markers, the further apart they are assumed to be. Conversely, the lower the frequency of recombination between the markers, the smaller the physical distance between them. Historically, the markers originally used were detectable phenotypes (enzyme production, eye colour) derived from coding DNA sequences; eventually, confirmed or assumed noncoding DNA sequences such as microsatellites or those generating restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) have been used.|$|E
25|$|The genetic {{composition}} of the offspring depends on what type of apomixis takes place. When endomitosis occurs before meiosis or when central fusion occurs (restitutional meiosis of anaphase I or the fusion of its products), the offspring get all to {{more than half of}} the mother's genetic material and heterozygosity is mostly preserved (if the mother has two alleles for a locus, it is likely that the offspring will get both). This is because in anaphase I the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are separated. Heterozygosity is not completely preserved when crossing over occurs in central fusion. In the case of pre-meiotic doubling, recombination -if it happens- occurs between identical sister chromatids.|$|E
40|$|Mutations {{caused by}} the Tc 1 {{transposon}} in Caenorhabditis elegans can revert by loss of the element. Usually the transposon leaves behind a 'footprint' [...] a few nucleotides of one or {{both ends of the}} transposon. Two possible explanations for the footprints are: (i) imprecise excision or (ii) interrupted repair. Here I report that in a diploid animal having a homozygous Tc 1 insertion the reversion frequency is approximately 10 (- 4), and a Tc 1 footprint is found; however when the corresponding sequence on the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> is wild-type, the reversion frequency is 100 times higher, and the reverted sequence is precise. Apparently the footprint results from incomplete gene conversion from the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome,</b> and not from imprecise excision of Tc 1. These results support the following model: Tc 1 excision leaves a double-strand DNA break, which can be repaired using the <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosome</b> or sister chromatid as a template. In heterozygotes repair can lead to reversion; in homozygotes Tc 1 is copied into the 'empty' site, and only rare interrupted repair leads to reversion, hence the 100 -fold lower reversion rate and the footprint...|$|R

Many hundreds of strains are maintained, and over 400 Mendelian mutations have been described. Another source suggests 1,000 inbred domesticated strains are kept worldwide. One useful development for the silk industry is silkworms that can feed on food other than mulberry leaves, including an artificial diet. Research on the genome also raises the possibility of genetically engineering silkworms to produce proteins, including pharmacological drugs, in the place of silk proteins.

25|$|Polyploidy, {{where there}} are more than two sets of <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in the cells, occurs mainly in plants. It has been of major {{significance}} in plant evolution according to Stebbins. The proportion of flowering plants which are polyploid was estimated by Stebbins to be 30–35%, but in grasses the average is much higher, about 70%. Polyploidy in lower plants (ferns, horsetails and psilotales) is also common, and some species of ferns have reached levels of polyploidy far in excess of the highest levels known in flowering plants.Polyploidy in animals is much less common, but it has been significant in some groups.Polyploid series in related species which consist entirely of multiples of a single basic number are known as euploid.|$|E

His further experiments, published the following year, strongly suggested that A.pinnatifidum is an allotetraploid, the product of hybridization between A.montanum and A.rhizophyllum to form a sterile diploid, followed by chromosome doubling that restored fertility. However, the hypothesized sterile diploid has never been found. Partial pairing of <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> in A.×gravesii and A.×trudellii confirmed A.montanum parentage for A.pinnatifidum, while an artificial hybrid between A.pinnatifidum and Tutwiler's spleenwort (A.tutwilerae) helped confirm their shared A.rhizophyllum parentage.|$|E

25|$|Since {{hypotheses}} for {{the origins}} of sex are difficult to test experimentally (outside of Evolutionary computation), most current work {{has focused on the}} maintenance of sexual reproduction. Sexual reproduction must offer significant fitness advantages to a species because despite the two-fold cost of sex, it dominates among multicellular forms of life, implying that the fitness of offspring produced outweighs the costs. Sexual reproduction derives from recombination, where parent genotypes are reorganized and shared with the offspring. This stands in contrast to single-parent asexual replication, where the offspring is identical to the parents. Recombination supplies two fault-tolerance mechanisms at the molecular level: recombinational DNA repair (promoted during meiosis because <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> pair at that time) and complementation (also known as heterosis, hybrid vigor or masking of mutations).|$|E
25|$|One of the best-recognized {{theories}} {{that leads to}} copy number variations as well as deletions and inversions is non-allelic homologous recombinations. During meiotic recombination, <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> pair up and form two ended double-stranded breaks leading to Holliday junctions. However, in the aberrant mechanism, during the formation of Holliday junctions, the double-stranded breaks are misaligned and the crossover lands in non-allelic positions on the same chromosome. When the Holliday junction is resolved, the unequal crossing over event allows transfer of genetic material between the two <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes,</b> and as a result, {{a portion of the}} DNA on both the homologues is repeated. Since the repeated regions are no longer segregating independently, the duplicated region of the chromosome is inherited. Another type of homologous recombination based mechanism that can lead to copy number variation is known as break induced replication. When a double stranded break occurs in the genome unexpectedly the cell activates pathways that mediate the repair of the break. Errors in repairing the break, similar to non-allelic homologous recombination, can lead to an increase in copy number of a particular region of the genome. During the repair of a double stranded break, the broken end can invade its homologous chromosome instead of rejoin the original strand. As in the non-allelic homologous recombination mechanism, an extra copy of a particular region is transferred to another chromosome, leading to a duplication event. Furthermore, cohesin proteins are found to aid in the repair system of double stranded breaks through clamping the two ends in close proximity which prevents interchromosomal invasion of the ends. If for any reason, such as activation of ribosomal RNA, cohesin activity is affected then there may be local increase in double stranded break repair errors.|$|E
25|$|In 1954, Herb Wagner, {{who did not}} {{yet have}} access to live material, noted that the size of the guard cells in A.×kentuckiense {{suggested}} that it was triploid, consistent with its proposed parentage. He also noted that, in theory, the crossing of mountain spleenwort (A.montanum) with Tutwiler's spleenwort (A.tutwilerae) or of A.bradleyi with walking fern (A.rhizophyllum) could also produce A.×kentuckiense. Smith, Bryant, and Tate obtained live material in 1961, which allowed them to observe that the species is indeed triploid, and that no pairing of <b>homologous</b> <b>chromosomes</b> occurred during meiosis. This strongly supported the hypothesis that A.×kentuckiense developed from the crossing of A.pinnatifidum and A.platyneuron, as the former species is not descended from A.platyneuron. Chromatographic experiments reported in 1963 showed that, like A.×gravesii, chromatograms made from A.×kentuckiense contained all the compounds from the chromatograms of all three of its diploid ancestors: A.montanum, A.platyneuron, and A.rhizophyllum.|$|E
