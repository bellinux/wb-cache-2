50|$|Traditionally {{there has}} existed a divide between conservationists, {{who want to}} set land aside for the {{protection}} of wild biodiversity, and agriculturalists, who want to use land for production.

40|$|<b>Ecoagriculture</b> is an {{approach}} to landscape management that simultaneously advances agricultural production, conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services, and sustainable rural livelihoods. In this dissertation, I address gaps in the science and application of <b>ecoagriculture</b> by reviewing key antecedents of this approach, enumerating a framework for <b>ecoagriculture</b> practice, and evaluating <b>ecoagriculture</b> outcomes—particularly biodiversity conservation—in pasture-dominated landscapes in northern Latin America. <b>Ecoagriculture</b> builds upon multiple disciplines and traditions of practice including landscape and ecosystem approaches, adaptive management, and integrated natural resource management. These antecedents inform the Landscape Measures approach, a structure for guiding multi-stakeholder planning, decision-making, and monitoring of <b>ecoagriculture</b> objectives at a landscape scale. Pilot applications of this approach in Honduras and Kenya suggest its value for promoting landscape multifunctionality by documenting landscape dynamics, fostering constructive dialogue among diverse stakeholders, and improving empirical bases for collective decision-making. Previous {{research has indicated that}} a substantial proportion of native species may persist in Neotropical agricultural mosaics. However, the consistency of these findings—and thus their applicability to unstudied locales—remains unknown. I conducted a coordinated multi-site study to evaluate the consistency of relationships between bird and butterfly assemblage characteristics and land use practices in four landscapes spanning four countries in northern Latin America: Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Bird and butterfly species richness and abundance were significantly related to land use across all four landscapes, and were generally positively correlated with degree of tree cover. In the Honduras landscape, I also investigated the relative influence of land use, vegetation, and landscape composition and structure on bird and butterfly assemblages. These assemblages were more strongly related to land use and plot-scale habitat features than to gradients of landscape composition and structure. Across all landscapes, habitat heterogeneity fostered high levels of beta diversity and high overall species richness, but only a modest presence of forest-dependent and high conservation value species. The findings underscore the importance of considering multiple conservation values when evaluating conservation outcomes in <b>ecoagriculture</b> landscapes. These values include protecting species of intermediate conservation concern and species that support rural livelihoods—not only globally threatened biodiversity...|$|E

40|$|This study {{employed}} participatory {{approaches to}} establish ways of engaging local communities within a transfrontier conservation area, towards achieving {{the goals of}} integrated agricultural production and biodiversity conservation at a landscape level, known as <b>ecoagriculture.</b> We facilitated farmers' meetings to create charts of local environmental and livelihood concerns and of their vision of the future. Water scarcity, bad road conditions, unemployment and low harvests emerged among the most prevalent concerns. Through a visioning process, participants arrived at a desired future that was largely inclined towards improved livelihoods, with comparatively little attention on biodiversity enhancement. We conclude that stakeholder-driven <b>ecoagriculture</b> could be a sustainable strategy to simultaneously achieve the community's vision and the goals of transfrontier conservation areas, provided biodiversity management strategies are linked to infrastructure improvement and income generating activities.

40|$|Multipurpose mosaic ("ecoagriculture") landscapes {{can serve}} {{the purpose of}} land sharing to combine {{objectives}} of agricultural production and biodiversity conservation. Rewarding the people who shape and maintain those landscapes could act as a mechanism to generate added-value representing an indirect payment for ecosystem services. We investigated the feasibility of such an approach in two areas in Southern Africa differing in spatial configurations, history and socio-economic context. We designed and tested a composite index describing the state of each landscape in terms of <b>ecoagriculture</b> criteria (conservation, production, institutions and livelihood) and ecosystem services (provisioning, regulating and cultural services). The resulting index {{is made up of}} different sets of data each comprising 40 scores, obtained from stakeholders' participatory interviews. Ecosystem services are in general assigned more importance than <b>ecoagriculture</b> criteria. In both cases, cultural services receive the highest scores, whereas the lowest ones are attributed to the livelihood and institutions in the Zimbabwean and South African sites, respectively. Index values reveal that the South African site, where there is more integration between land-use units, does better in terms of a landscape performing multiple functions. Provided relevant stakeholders are involved and a certification mechanism is developed, the landscape labelling index can be used to recognize and reward the value of outstanding rural landscapes.

40|$|The green {{revolution}} of the 1960 s and 1970 s which resulted in dramatic yield increases in the developing Asian countries is now showing signs of fatigue in productivity gains. Intensive agriculture practiced without adherence to the scientific principles and ecological aspects has led to loss of soil health, and depletion of freshwater resources and agrobiodiversity. With progressive diversion of arable land for non-agricultural purposes, the challenge of feeding the growing population without, at the same time, annexing more forestland and depleting the rest of life is indeed daunting. Further, even with food availability through production/procurement, millions of marginal farming, fishing and landless rural families have very low or no access to food {{due to lack of}} income-generating livelihoods.

Innovative practitioners, scientists and indigenous land managers are adapting, designing and managing diverse types of ‘ecoagriculture’ landscapes to generate positive co-benefits for production, biodiversity and local people.
