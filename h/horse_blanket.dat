She would wear these awards on her <b>horse</b> <b>blanket,</b> plus a French Fourragere that the 5th Marines earned in World War I.|$|E
25|$|In the winter, horses grow a heavy {{hair coat}} {{to keep warm}} and usually stay warm if well-fed and allowed access to shelter. But if kept artificially clipped for show, or if under stress from age, {{sickness}} or injury, a <b>horse</b> <b>blanket</b> {{may need to be}} added to protect the horse from cold weather. In the summer, access to shade is well-advised.|$|E
500|$|The Marines, {{especially}} Latham, taught Reckless battlefield {{survival skills}} such as how not to become entangled in barbed wire and to lie down when under fire. She learned to run for a bunker upon hearing the cry, [...] "incoming!" [...] The platoon called it her [...] "hoof training" [...] and [...] "hoof camp". The horse was initially kept in a pasture near the encampment. Reckless had a gentle disposition and soon developed such a rapport with the troops that she was allowed to freely roam about the camp and entered tents at will, sometimes sleeping inside with the troops, and even lying down next to Latham's warm tent stove on cold nights. She was fond {{of a wide variety}} of foodstuffs, entertaining the platoon by eating scrambled eggs and drinking Coca-Cola and beer. Food could not be left unattended around her. She was known to eat bacon, buttered toast, chocolate bars, hard candy, shredded wheat, peanut butter sandwiches and mashed potatoes. However, Mitchell advised the platoon that she not be given more than two bottles of Coke a day. [...] Her tastes were not confined to foodstuffs; she once ate her <b>horse</b> <b>blanket,</b> and on another occasion ate $30 worth of Latham's winning poker chips.|$|E

50|$|In Central Asia, Bokhara couching using {{continuous}} thread creates spectacular suzanis, hangings for wedding {{halls and}} bridal beds. Carnation and pomegranate motifs symbolised fertility.

2500|$|Horses can be bathed {{by being}} wet {{down with a}} garden hose, {{but they do not}} require bathing and many horses live their entire lives without a bath. [...] Either horse or human shampoo may be safely used on a horse, if {{thoroughly}} rinsed out, and cream rinses or hair conditioners, similar to those used by humans, are often used on show horses. [...] Too-frequent shampooing can strip the hair coat of natural oils and cause it to dry out. [...] A well-groomed, clean horse can be kept clean by wearing a <b>horse</b> <b>blanket</b> or horse sheet.|$|E

50|$|Most of {{the wool}} that Awamaki weavers work with is shorn {{from their own}} sheep and alpaca. Llama wool is also used, but being very coarse it is used only for {{utilitarian}} items such as sacks, ropes and <b>horse</b> <b>blankets.</b>|$|R

60|$|Under Ben's {{direction}} he wrapped himself {{in an old}} <b>horse</b> <b>blanket,</b> {{and lay down on}} the top of the wagon; and he was so tired from the excitement of the day and night that he had hardly stretched out at full length before he was fast asleep.|$|E
60|$|It was {{but little}} after sunrise when Sam drove {{out into the}} road and started for Belleplain. His wife sat perched upon the wheat sacks behind him, holding the baby in her lap, a cotton quilt under her, and a cotton <b>horse</b> <b>blanket</b> over her knees.|$|E

60|$|When {{the others}} arrived {{they found that}} Tom had carried poor Dick to the wagon shed and placed him {{on a pile of}} <b>horse</b> <b>blankets,</b> and was washing his wounded head with water. At the sight of her nephew lying there so still Mrs. Rover gave a scream.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and I see Dangler!" [...] yelled Tom, suddenly. [...] "There he goes, {{with a big}} bundle {{over his}} shoulder!" [...] And {{he pointed to the}} rear of the log cabin. A man was just disappearing behind a fringe of brushwood. The bundle he carried {{appeared}} to be tied up in a <b>horse</b> <b>blanket.</b> He was running as hard as he could.|$|E
60|$|Stanley, who {{had brought}} a <b>horse</b> <b>blanket</b> with him to lay {{on the top of}} the palisade, was the first to drop into the inclosure. Meinik {{followed}} him closely. Nothing had been said to the guard as to the white officer, of whom Meinik had spoken, being himself of the party; and Stanley had purposely left his pistols behind him, lest he should be tempted to use them. In case he was attacked, he carried a spear and a long Burmese knife.|$|E
60|$|Straggling bits of forest--yellow pines, {{the driver}} called the trees--began to {{encroach}} upon the burned-over and arid barren land. To Carley these groves, {{by reason of}} contrast and proof of what once was, only rendered the landscape more forlorn and dreary. Why had these {{miles and miles of}} forest been cut? By money grubbers, she supposed, the same as were devastating the Adirondacks. Presently, when the driver had to halt to repair or adjust something wrong with the harness, Carley was grateful for a respite from cold inaction. She got out and walked. Sleet began to fall, and when she resumed her seat in the vehicle she asked the driver for the blanket to cover her. The smell of this <b>horse</b> <b>blanket</b> was less endurable than the cold. Carley huddled down into a state of apathetic misery. Already she had enough of the West.|$|E
5000|$|Standard <b>horse</b> <b>blankets</b> are {{commonly}} kept {{on a horse}} when it is loose in a stall or pasture as well as when traveling. Different weights are made for different weather conditions, and some are water-resistant or waterproof.

60|$|It was {{a harness}} store we found {{ourselves}} in, and he fixed me up a couch of <b>horse</b> <b>blankets</b> in the private office well to the rear. To add to my wretchedness a splitting headache was coming on, and I was only too glad to {{close my eyes and}} try to sleep.|$|R
5000|$|The filly {{was sent}} into {{training}} with Luca Cumani at Newmarket, Suffolk and was ridden {{in all of}} her races by Jamie Spencer. She was an unusually small Thoroughbred: <b>horse</b> <b>blankets</b> designed for standard-sized horses trailed below her knees and some commentators described her as [...] "pony-sized" [...] and doubted that she would ever make a top-class racehorse.|$|R
60|$|It was Isaac D. Worthington--or {{shall we}} say Mr. Flint?--who was {{responsible}} for this pernicious change for the worse, who conceived the notion of leasing for the Truro the Central and the Northwestern,--thus making one railroad out of the three. If such a gigantic undertaking could be got through, Mr. Worthington very rightly deemed that the other railroads of the state would eventually fall like ripe fruit into their caps--owning the ground under the tree, as they would. A movement, which we need not go unto, was first made upon the courts, {{and for a while}} adverse decisions came down like summer rain. A genius by the name of Jethro Bass had for many years presided (in the room of the governor and council at the State House) at the political birth of justices of the Supreme Court. None of them actually wore livery, but we have seen one of them--along time ago--in a <b>horse</b> <b>blanket.</b> None of them were favorable to the plans of Mr. Worthington and Mr. Duncan.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{what they}} call the rule of the house,--or of the order, I believe," [...] said Mrs. Bread. [...] "There is no rule so strict as that of the Carmelites. The bad women in the {{reformatories}} are fine ladies to them. They wear old brown cloaks--so the femme de chambre told me--that you wouldn't use for a <b>horse</b> <b>blanket.</b> And the poor countess was so fond of soft-feeling dresses; she would never have anything stiff! They sleep on the ground," [...] Mrs. Bread went on; [...] "they are no better, no better,"--and she hesitated for a comparison,--"they are no better than tinkers' wives. They give up everything, down to the very name their poor old nurses called them by. They give up father and mother, brother and sister,--to say nothing of other persons," [...] Mrs. Bread delicately added. [...] "They wear a shroud under their brown cloaks and a rope round their waists, and they get up on winter nights and go off into cold places to pray to the Virgin Mary. The Virgin Mary is a hard mistress!" ...|$|E

50|$|He {{graduated}} from Albany Law School in 1868, and {{was admitted to}} the bar. Looking for a place to practice law, he engaged instead in the black walnut lumber business in Missouri and Illinois; then grew oranges in Florida; then was a merchant in the Red River Valley; and finally became a lumberman on the shores of Lake Superior. In 1876, he returned home and purchased the Candor Woolen Mills where he manufactured <b>horse</b> <b>blankets.</b>|$|R
50|$|In his tailor shop, Davis made {{functional}} {{items such}} as tents, <b>horse</b> <b>blankets</b> and wagon covers for the railway workers on the Central Pacific Railroad. The fabric Davis worked with was heavy-duty cotton duck cloth and cotton denim which he bought from Levi Strauss & Co., a dry goods company in San Francisco. To strengthen the stress points of the sewn items he was making, Davis used copper rivets to reinforce the stitching.|$|R
