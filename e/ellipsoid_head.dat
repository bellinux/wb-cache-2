50|$|Robita's character, {{known as}} Nora in the English version, has been reused for the 2003 anime series of Astro Boy. The robot keeps his {{cylindrical}} body and <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>head,</b> but {{is given a}} less dark and more cartoonish look: yellow color, telescopic arms and green bubbly eyes. The character also saw a change in gender, being referred to as 'she'.|$|E
50|$|Robita first appears (in the {{chronological order}} of the manga release) in Future, {{where he is a}} grey {{cylindrical}} robot with an <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>head,</b> the eyes being a slit and his arms being articulated with claws. He is an assistant to an old recluse mad scientist called Dr. Saruta, the last descendant of the Sarutas in the Phoenix continuity. Although Robita may only be a robot, he shows signs of personality and kindness, which even astonishes Saruta himself.|$|E
40|$|This study proposes an {{optimized}} {{approach of}} designing {{in which a}} model specially shaped composite tank for spacecrafts is built by applying finite element analysis. The composite layers are preliminarily designed by combining quasi-network design method with numerical simulation, which determines the ratio between the angle and the thickness of layers as the initial value of the optimized design. By adopting an adaptive simulated annealing algorithm, the angles and the numbers of layers at each angle are optimized to minimize the weight of structure. Based on this, the stacking sequence of composite layers is formulated according {{to the number of}} layers in the optimized structure by applying the enumeration method and combining the general design parameters. Numerical simulation is finally adopted to calculate the buckling limit of tanks in different designing methods. This study takes a composite tank with a cone-shaped cylinder body as example, in which <b>ellipsoid</b> <b>head</b> section and outer wall plate are selected as the object to validate this method. The result shows that the quasi-network design method can improve the design quality of composite material layer in tanks with complex preliminarily loading conditions. The adaptive simulated annealing algorithm can reduce the initial design weight by 30 %, which effectively probes the global optimal solution and optimizes the weight of structure. It can be therefore proved that, this optimization method is capable of designing and optimizing specially shaped composite tanks with complex loading conditions...|$|E
30|$|The same {{institutional}} team subsequently {{defined the}} bony rim percentage (BRP), {{which was an}} expression of the relative coverage of the femoral head by the bony acetabulum in the frontal flexion view [14]. However, the usability of the coverage percentage seems to be open to discussion, as the coverage of the <b>ellipsoid</b> femoral <b>head</b> can alter with rotation of the femoral head in a frontal plane image. Validation using the quantitative measurements such as Graf’s α angle or the BRP (currently named as the femoral head coverage) is optional in the Harcke method [11].|$|R
40|$|Video {{surveillance}} applications need {{tools to}} track people trajectories. We present here a new method {{to extract the}} 3 D head trajectory of {{a person in a}} room using only one calibrated camera. A 3 D <b>ellipsoid</b> representing the <b>head</b> is used to track the person with a hierarchical particle filter. This method can run in quasi-real-time providing reasonable 3 D errors for a monocular system...|$|R
50|$|As {{a sexually}} {{monomorphic}} species, T. moorii {{can be quite}} challenging to sex. The upper lip of males is more prominent (i.e., larger) than that of females. Males' lips on average {{tend to be more}} off-white, as well, due to their constant lip-locking aggression. Furthermore, males tend to have a turned-up nose, while females tend to have a greater slope and rounded nose, making the shape of their <b>heads</b> <b>ellipsoid.</b> Males generally grow at a faster rate and display their adult colors sooner. Males' coloration is also often more bold than females' because they display when courting females. Adult males also tend to have a deeper body, whereas females appear more slim and streamlined.|$|R
