25|$|The diverterless {{supersonic}} inlet (DSI) enables {{an aircraft}} to reach Mach 2.0 with a simpler intake than traditionally required, and improves stealth performance by eliminating radar reflections between the <b>diverter</b> and the aircraft's skin. Analysts {{have noted that}} the J-20 DSI reduces the need for application of radar absorbent materials.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent this}} from happening, a valve is fitted between the {{turbocharger}} and inlet, which vents off the excess air pressure. These {{are known as}} an anti-surge, <b>diverter,</b> bypass, turbo-relief valve, blow-off valve (BOV), or dump valve. It is a pressure relief valve, and is normally operated by the vacuum from the intake manifold.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary use}} of this valve is to {{maintain}} the spinning of the turbocharger at a high speed. The air is usually recycled back into the turbocharger inlet (<b>diverter</b> or bypass valves), but can also be vented to the atmosphere (blow off valve). Recycling back into the turbocharger inlet is required on an engine that uses a mass-airflow fuel injection system, because dumping the excessive air overboard downstream of the mass airflow sensor causes an excessively rich fuel mixture—because the mass-airflow sensor has already accounted for the extra air {{that is no longer}} being used. Valves that recycle the air also shorten the time needed to re-spool the turbocharger after sudden engine deceleration, since load on the turbocharger when the valve is active is much lower than if the air charge vents to atmosphere.|$|E

If left unchecked, undesired flows mix {{substantial amounts of}} partially heated and partially cooled portions of working fluid, effectively causing leakage of heat from heated side to cooled side. By reducing leakage of heat, flow <b>diverters</b> increase energy efficiency of magnetic heat pump, potentially offering efficiency greater than compressor-driven refrigerator...|$|R
25|$|The cost of {{breathing}} gas containing a high fraction of helium {{is a significant}} part of the cost of deep diving operations, and can be reduced by recovering the breathing gas for recycling. A reclaim helmet is provided with a return line in the diver's umbilical, and exhaled gas is discharged to this hose through a reclaim regulator, which ensures that gas pressure in the helmet cannot fall below the ambient pressure. The gas is processed at the surface in the helium reclaim system by filtering, scrubbing and boosting into storage cylinders until needed. The oxygen content may be adjusted when appropriate. The same principle is used in built-in breathing systems used to vent oxygen-rich treatment gases from a hyperbaric chamber, though those gases are generally not reclaimed. A <b>diverter</b> valve is provided to allow the diver to manually switch to open circuit if the reclaim valve malfunctions, and an underpressure flood valve allows water to enter the helmet to avoid a squeeze if the reclaim valve fails suddenly, allowing the diver time to switch to open circuit without injury.|$|E

It is beneath a cover (released from inside the car), [...] there is a dust cover beneath to keep out insects etc. [...] There are two large pins (for the charging current) and eight small ones for control circuitry. [...] The cable used for this purpose is captive to the roadside charging point. When the car is on fast (DC) charge, the air conditioning system is automatically started and refrigerated air is blown through the battery pack for cooling purposes. There is a <b>diverter</b> flap in the ventilation system for this. From depletion, the battery may be charged to 80% full in 20 minutes using this socket.|$|E
2500|$|Endovascular coiling was {{introduced}} by Guido Guglielmi at UCLA in 1991. It consists of passing a catheter into the femoral artery in the groin, through the aorta, into the brain arteries, and finally into the aneurysm itself. Platinum coils initiate a clotting reaction within the aneurysm that, if successful fill the aneurysm dome and prevent its rupture.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{increased}} geometrical closure on the behaviour of the recycling and intrinsic impurities are investigated in JET Mark I, Mark IIA and Mark IIGB pumped <b>diverters.</b> Increasing the divertor closure {{leads to a}} significant improvement in exhaust for both deuterium and recycling impurities. However, the impurity enrichment in the exhaust gases remains unchanged due to a simultaneous increase in deuterium and impurity compression in the divertor. A comparison is made for helium, neon and argon under different plasma conditions. In addition, {{the operation of the}} Mark II and Mark IIGB <b>diverters</b> has shown that Z(eff) is reduced with the improved divertor closure in the L mode discharges, although no obvious changes in the Z(eff) values have been observed in the ELMy H modes. The divertor target surface temperature has a strong influence on intrinsic carbon production. The carbon source in the Mark II and Mark IIGB <b>diverters</b> is significantly higher than that in the Mark I divertor, which is attributed to enhanced chemical sputtering at the increased divertor tile temperature of the Mark II and Mark IIGB <b>diverters</b> (related to the divertor cooling system), as opposed to the increased closure. The consequences of this elevated yield for plasmas under different operation conditions are discussed, and further evidence, obtained from a specific wall/divertor temperature reduction experiment, is presented. The effect of the divertor screening on the chemically produced impurities is investigated using the EDGE 2 D/NIMBUS/DIVIMP codes for the different recycling regimes and comparisons are made with experimental observations from the Mark I, Mark IIA and Mark IIAP <b>diverters</b> taking into account the change in chemical sputtering yield due to the different tile temperatures of these <b>diverters...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{mechanical}} {{tap changer}} physically makes the new connection before releasing the old using multiple tap selector switches but avoids creating high circulating currents {{by using a}} <b>diverter</b> switch to temporarily place a large <b>diverter</b> impedance in series with the short-circuited turns. This technique overcomes the problems with open or short circuit taps. In a resistance type tap changer, the changeover must be made rapidly to avoid overheating of the <b>diverter.</b> A reactance type tap changer uses a dedicated preventive autotransformer winding to function as the <b>diverter</b> impedance, and a reactance type tap changer is usually designed to sustain off-tap loading indefinitely.|$|E

40|$|Flow-diverter {{devices are}} new, {{important}} {{tools in the}} treat-ment of intracranial aneurysms. 1 Several single- and multi-center studies have demonstrated acceptable rates of aneurysm occlusion, morbidity, and mortality for patients treated with flow <b>diverters.</b> 2 – 30 These devices are being deployed in greater numbers of patients with more complex aneurysm morpholo-gies and locations. 9, 12, 18, 22, 25, 29 With increasing experience, some of the limitations and unexpected complications of flow <b>diverters</b> have been recognized. These include intraparenchy-mal hemorrhage (IPH), postprocedural subarachnoid hemor-rhage (SAH), as well as ischemic stroke. 8 Improved understanding of safety and efficacy profiles asso-ciated with flow-diverter treatment of intracranial aneurysms would help guide practitioners in selection and follow-up of patients treated with these devices.
