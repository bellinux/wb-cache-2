500|$|Wałęsa is {{well known}} for his anti-gay position. In 2013 he said on Polish {{television}} that homosexual people have no right to a prominent role in politics, [...] "They <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> they are a minority and must adjust to smaller things". He also said homosexual MPs should sit [...] "behind a wall" [...] in a parliament. Despite sharp international criticism and a legal complaint of [...] "propaganda of hate against a sexual minority", Wałęsa refused to apologize for his comments. At a political rally in 2000, he described gay people as [...] "sick" [...] and said, [...] "I believe those people need medical treatment". During the drawing up of a new Polish Constitution in 1995, President Wałęsa argued against the inclusion of gay rights provisions. In 2014 City authorities of San Francisco renamed Walesa Street because of his [...] "anti-gay remarks". A deputy speaker of the Polish Parliament said Wałęsa's anti-gay position could jeopardize his international career as a human rights speaker.|$|E

[...] "not to be affected by the radicalism of their president, [...] suffer from the international isolation because of the reckless policies which is unacceptable to every mind and every religion."

2500|$|Botvinnik used almost {{exclusively}} queen-side pawn openings with the White pieces, in his eight World Championship matches, he never started {{a game with}} an e4 opening, and his usual choices as White were the English Opening or Queen's Gambit. When playing the Black pieces, he preferred the French Defense or Sicilian Defense in response to 1. e4 and the Slav Defense or Nimzo-Indian Defense in response to 1. d4. While Botvinnik did not use {{a wide range of}} openings, he made major contributions to those he did use, for example: the Botvinnik variation of the Semi-Slav Defense in the Queen's Gambit Declined, the Kasparov/Botvinnik system in the Exchange Variation of the Queen's Gambit Declined, the Caro-Kann Defence (both the Panov-Botvinnik Attack for White and various approaches for Black), the Winawer Variation of the French Defence, the Botvinnik System in the English Opening. In his openings research Botvinnik did not aim to produce tactical tricks that would only be effective once but rather systems in which he aimed to understand typical positions and their possibilities better than his rivals. His advice to his pupils included [...] "My theory of the openings fitted into one notebook" [...] and [...] "You don’t <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> which everyone knows, {{but it is important to}} know that which not everyone knows." [...] In fact he used different notebooks in different periods, and copied a few analyses from one notebook to the next.|$|E
