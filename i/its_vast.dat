5|$|Despite <b>its</b> <b>vast</b> {{government}} {{revenue from the}} mining of petroleum, Nigeria faces a number of societal issues, owing primarily to a history of inefficiency in its governance.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, Smithfield and {{neighbouring}} Farringdon {{have developed a}} reputation for being a cultural hub for up-and-coming professionals who enjoy <b>its</b> <b>vast</b> selection of bars, restaurants and night clubs.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{variability}} of the mallard's genetic code, which gives it <b>its</b> <b>vast</b> interbreeding capability, mutations in the genes that decide plumage colour are very common and {{have resulted in a}} wide variety of hybrids such as Brewer's duck (mallard × gadwall, Anas strepera).|$|E
60|$|This note {{of appeal}} he inevitably {{contrasted with the}} dry, matter-of-fact reserve of his {{greeting}} at the great house, which loomed all the greater in the darkness. Unsatisfactory, from many points of view, as these evenings were, they served to keep whetted Hodder's curiosity as {{to the life of}} this extraordinary man. All of <b>its</b> <b>vaster</b> significance for the world, its tremendous machinery, was out of his sight.|$|R
50|$|After the Ottoman {{conquest of}} the Levant from the Mamluks in 1516, Galilee became part of <b>its</b> empire. <b>Vast</b> areas of Turkey, Asia, North Africa and Southeastern Europe were ruled almost {{autonomously}} by local governors. The Levant in particular, split into numerous feuding power centers.|$|R

It has {{occasionally}} licensed popular characters from other rival studios, {{many of whom}} did not operate theme parks themselves, as attractions, past and present. Some examples include: ...|$|R
5|$|The {{number of}} {{individual}} mourning doves {{is estimated to}} be approximately 475 million. The large population and <b>its</b> <b>vast</b> range explain why the mourning dove is considered to be of least concern, meaning that the species is not at immediate risk. As a gamebird, the mourning dove is well-managed, with more than 20 million (and up to 40–70 million) shot by hunters each year.|$|E
5|$|American crows are {{protected}} internationally by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Despite attempts by humans {{in some areas}} to drive away or eliminate these birds, they remain widespread and very common. The number of individual American crows is estimated by BirdLife International to be around 31,000,000. The large population, as well as <b>its</b> <b>vast</b> range, are {{the reasons why the}} American crow is considered to be of least concern, meaning that the species is not threatened.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, and just {{opposite}} his own tomb, Ramesses enlarged the earlier small tomb {{of an unknown}} Eighteenth Dynasty noble (KV5) for his numerous sons. With 120 known rooms, and excavation work still underway, it is probably the largest tomb in the valley. Originally opened (and robbed) in antiquity, it is a low-lying structure that has been particularly prone to the flash floods that sometimes hit the area. Tonnes of debris and material has washed in over the centuries, ultimately concealing <b>its</b> <b>vast</b> size. It is not currently open to the public.|$|E
25|$|The {{instrumental}} {{ensemble of}} Cantonese opera {{is composed of}} two sections: the melody section and the percussion section. The percussion section has <b>its</b> own <b>vast</b> body of musical materials, generally called lo gu dim (鑼鼓點) or simply lo gu (鑼鼓). These 'percussion patterns' serve a variety of specific functions.|$|R
50|$|Rolemaster is {{sometimes}} derisively called 'Chartmaster' or 'Rulemonster' for depending upon numerous tables and charts for character generation and resolving game actions, and for <b>its</b> perceived <b>vast</b> array of rules covering every possible situation. Supporters {{of the game}} argue {{that many of these}} rules and charts are entirely optional.|$|R

5|$|Due to <b>its</b> <b>vast</b> {{size and}} range of altitudes, Argentina {{possesses}} {{a wide variety of}} climatic regions, ranging from the hot subtropical region in the north to the cold subantarctic in the far south. Lying between those is the Pampas region, featuring a mild and humid climate. Many regions have different, often contrasting, microclimates. In general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm, moderate, arid, and cold in which the relief features, and the latitudinal extent of the country, determine the different varieties within the main climate types.|$|E
5|$|In 1831, Rundell and Bridge {{sold the}} diamond to the Emanuel Brothers for about 7,200 pounds (today about £). Six {{years later in}} 1837, the Emanuel Brothers sold the Nassak Diamond at a public sale to Robert Grosvenor, the 1st Marquess of Westminster. At one point, the Marquess mounted the diamond in the handle of his dress sword. In 1886, the diamond was valued at between 30,000 and 40,000 pounds (today between £ and £), {{due in part to}} <b>its</b> <b>vast</b> gain in brilliancy from the re-cut by Rundell and Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In 1849 the British {{seized control}} of Lahore from the Sikh Empire. During the British Raj, the mosque and the {{adjoining}} fort continued {{to be used as}} a military garrison. The 80 cells built into the walls surrounding the <b>its</b> <b>vast</b> courtyard were demolished by the British after the Freedom Fight of 1857, so as to prevent them from being used for anti-British activities. The cells were replaced by open arcades known as dalans.|$|E
50|$|Although this {{viewpoint}} actually {{begins with}} woman as the “standard” human {{and proceeds to}} define man by <b>its</b> supposed <b>vast</b> differences from that standard, people {{do not like to}} see themselves in negative terms, so men have generally sought ways to transform woman into a negative, thus making man positive.|$|R
50|$|The Enclave {{is often}} praised for <b>its</b> {{subsequently}} <b>vast</b> cargo space {{while maintaining the}} relatively dynamic nature of unibody construction over the conventional body-on-frame. It is also praised for {{being one of the}} quietest vehicles available for sale in the United States, {{as well as for the}} quality of the interior.|$|R

5|$|In September 2006, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged CHXR 73 b (left), {{an object}} {{orbiting}} a young companion star {{at a distance}} of roughly 200 AU. At 12 Jovian masses, CHXR 73 b is just under the threshold for deuterium fusion, and thus technically a planet; however, <b>its</b> <b>vast</b> distance from its parent star suggests it could not have formed inside the small star's protoplanetary disc, and therefore must have formed, as stars do, from gravitational collapse.|$|E
5|$|Little {{research}} has been done on this species, and not much is known about its ecology. The purple-throated cotinga is primarily frugivorous, although it does occasionally eat small insects. A solitary male attracts a female by perching in the canopy and letting the sunlight reflect off its iridescent feathers. It is suspected to breed year-round and is non-migratory. Despite being considered naturally uncommon or rare across <b>its</b> <b>vast</b> range, the purple-throated cotinga is listed as a species of Least Concern.|$|E
5|$|Nri {{maintained}} <b>its</b> <b>vast</b> authority {{well into}} the 16th century. The peace mandated by the Nri religion and enforced {{by the presence of}} the mbùríchi allowed trade to flourish. Items such as horses, which did not survive in tsetse fly-infested Nri, and seashells, which would have to be transported a long ways due to Nri's distance from the coast, have been found depicted in Nri's bronze. A Nri dignitary was unearthed with ivory, also indicating a wealth in trade existed among the Nri. Another source of income would have been the income brought back by traveling mbùríchi.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the end of}} the Civil War, {{stories of}} the Confederate gold and <b>its</b> <b>vast</b> wealth have been told and retold. One of those stories {{involves}} Alexander. He helped organize search parties in Lincoln and Wilkes counties. Alexander and bank officials soon located some of the gold through Alexander's neighbors in Wilkes county and persuaded them that the money belonged to wives and children of Confederate veterans. With Alexander's help, bank officials eventually recovered some $111,000 of the stolen money. Former Confederate cabinet official Robert Toombs also turned over $5,000 that, intentionally or accidentally, had been thrown into his yard in Washington.|$|E
5|$|Early {{attempts}} by Ernest Flagg {{to limit the}} height of New York's skyscrapers in 1896 failed; further unsuccessful attempts followed between 1906 and 1908, and legislation was turned down again in 1909, partially because of pressure from the real estate industry. After 1913, however, the property market in New York entered a recession, and vacancy levels in buildings began to rise. The campaign for change was helped by {{the construction of the}} Equitable Building in 1915 at the estimated cost of $29 million ($10.9 billion in 2010 terms), which rapidly became infamous as <b>its</b> <b>vast</b> height and bulk blocked views and cast neighbours into permanent shade. The real estate industry finally ceased its objections to new legislation, and the 1916 Zoning Resolution was passed.|$|E
5|$|Saudi Arabia {{was one of}} {{the poorest}} and most undeveloped {{countries}} in the world when oil was discovered in the late 1930s. The country therefore needed foreign expertise and labour to exploit <b>its</b> <b>vast</b> oil reserves. As a result, in the years after World War II there was a growth in the numbers of foreign technical, professional and administrative personnel, mainly from other Middle Eastern countries but also supplied by Western oil companies, many of whom worked for ARAMCO (Arabian-American Oil Company). A much greater increase in the numbers of foreign workers came with the oil-price boom following the 1973 oil crisis. Infrastructure and development plans led to an influx of skilled and unskilled workers, principally Palestinians, Egyptians, Yemenis and others from Arab countries, but also Indians and Pakistanis, leading to a doubling of the Saudi population by 1985. Beginning in the early 1980s, South and East Asian countries, such as Thailand, Philippines and South Korea, increasingly provided migrant workers.|$|E

5|$|Together {{with the}} trade winds, the {{westerlies}} enabled a round-trip trade route for sailing ships crossing the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, as the westerlies {{lead to the}} development of strong ocean currents on the western sides of oceans in both hemispheres through the process of western intensification. These western ocean currents transport warm, sub tropical water polewards toward the polar regions. The westerlies can be particularly strong, especially in the southern hemisphere, where there is less land in the middle latitudes to cause the flow pattern to amplify, which slows the winds down. The strongest westerly winds in the middle latitudes are within a band known as the Roaring Forties, between 40 and 50degrees latitude south of the equator. The Westerlies {{play an important role in}} carrying the warm, equatorial waters and winds to the western coasts of continents, especially in the southern hemisphere because of <b>its</b> <b>vast</b> oceanic expanse.|$|E
5|$|After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry {{and raising}} vast armies united by {{ethnicity}} and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually {{to the establishment}} of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206. The sultanate was to control much of North India, and to make many forays into South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left <b>its</b> <b>vast</b> non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs. By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north. The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India {{paved the way for the}} indigenous Vijayanagara Empire. Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India, and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.|$|E
5|$|From one {{settlement}} in year 1, the Han Dynasty's {{involvement in the}} Minyue region grew into several counties. There were many Chinese counties in the area by the 4th century AD. The Minyue had been culturally assimilated {{by the time the}} Han Dynasty collapsed, and Chinese civilization was undergoing a transition to the Three Kingdoms period of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. Political upheaval in the north, such as Wang Mang's usurpation, had caused Han migrants to resettle in the south. The Han Dynasty's military expansion widened its commercial ties in addition acquiring large amounts of new territories. The empire's conquest of Minyue and Nanyue spoke of <b>its</b> <b>vast</b> size that it bordered the ancient kingdoms of Southeast Asia. Economic ties with the Han and subsequent dynasties affected the trajectory of maritime trade of Southeast Asia, where goods have been excavated made in styles resembling that of the ancient Han Chinese. Maritime trade and the Silk Road also linked China with Ancient Rome, India, and the Near East.|$|E

Archaeologically, traces of settlement of the Urnfield, the late Hallstatt and early La Tène cultures, the early Roman Empire and Great Migration period have been documented. The unusual size of the medieval castle and <b>its</b> two <b>vast</b> outer baileys with their deep ditches could indicate an early medieval hillfort.|$|R
