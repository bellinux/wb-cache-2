40|$|Abstract Progenitor cells {{derived from}} the oral mucosa lamina propria (OMLP-PCs) {{demonstrate}} an ability to differentiate into tissue lineages removed from their anatomical origin. This clonally derived population of neural-crest cells have demonstrated potential to differentiate along mesenchymal and neuronal cell lineages. Objective Significant efforts are being made to generate functioning muscle constructs for use in research and clinical tissue engineering. In this study we aimed to determine the myogenic properties of clonal populations of expanded OMLP-PCs. Design PCs were subject to several in vitro culture conditions {{in an attempt to}} drive myogenic conversion. Methodologies include use of demethylation <b>gene-modifying</b> reagents, mechanical conditioning of tissue culture substrates, tuneable polyacrylamide gels and a 3 -dimensional construct as well as published myogenic media compositions. PCR and immunostaining for the muscle cell markers Desmin and MyoD 1 were used to assess muscle differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Huntington's disease (HD) {{is a kind}} of {{inherited}} neurodegenerative disorder {{characterized by}} movement problems, cognitive decline and psychiatry disturbance. HD is caused by mutation in gene IT - 15 involving the expansion of a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat encoding glutamine, which leads to abnormal conformation of huntingtin (Htt) protein and finally emerge cytotoxic functions. Currently, HD remains a fatal untreatable disease. Gene therapy for HD discussed in this review is under preclinical studies. Silencing of mutant IT- 15 via RNA interference (RNAi) or antisense oligonucleotide (ASO) has shown some effectiveness in mouse model studies. Increasing the clearance of mutant Htt protein could be achieved by viral-mediated delivery of anti-Htt intrabodies (iAbs) or induction of autophagy, and beneficial results have been observed. Ectopic expression of neurotrophic factors, such as nerve growth factor (NGF) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), mediated either by viral vectors or transplantation of genetically modified cells, has also been proved to be effective. Other <b>gene-modifying</b> methods aiming at correction of transcriptional dysregulation by histone modification, activation of endogenous neural stem cells, and normalization of calcium signaling and mitochondrial function, are also under intensive research. Gene therapy for Huntington's disease is promising, yet a long way remains from preclinical studies to clinical trials...|$|R
50|$|The <b>gene-modified</b> {{effector}} cells are then transplanted {{back into the}} patient. Typically this process is done {{in conjunction with a}} conditioning regimen such as cyclophosphamide, which has been shown to potentiate the effects of infused T-cells. This effect has been attributed to making an immunologic space within which the cells populate. The process as a whole results in an effector cell, typically a T-cell, that can recognize a tumor cell antigen {{in a manner that is}} independent of the major histocompatibility complex and which can initiate a cytotoxic response.|$|E
50|$|Destruction of {{the immune}} system by the HIV is driven by the loss of CD4+ T cells in the {{peripheral}} blood and lymphoid tissues. Viral entry into CD4+ cells is mediated by the interaction with a cellular chemokine receptor, the most common of which are CCR5 and CXCR4. Because subsequent viral replication requires cellular gene expression processes, activated CD4+ cells are the primary targets of productive HIV infection. Recently scientists have been investigating an alternative approach to treating HIV-1/AIDS, based on the creation of a disease-resistant immune system through transplantation of autologous, <b>gene-modified</b> (HIV-1-resistant) hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (GM-HSPC).|$|E
50|$|Other {{theoretical}} cures to HIV-1 {{have been}} proposed. One supposed cure to HIV-1 involves {{the creation of}} a disease-resistant immune system through transplantation of autologous, <b>gene-modified</b> (HIV-1-resistant) hematopoietic stem cells and progenitor cells (GM-HSPC). Though this study does involve several early stage clinical trials that have demonstrated the safety and feasibility of this technique only for HIV-1, none have resulted in improvement of the disease state itself. Therefore, this strategy is intended to go alongside already existing treatment techniques such as drugs and vaccines. However, future technology regarding this approach of single treatment cell therapy could potentially replace current therapy altogether as a functional or sterilizing cure to HIV-1.|$|E
40|$|Cell {{and gene}} therapy of cancers has {{received}} much {{attention in the}} past decade. A number of applications of cancer treatment have been developed and used. One of the recent applications is immunotherapy of tumours with human natural killer (NK) cells. A major challenge to the successful application of this treatment has been the identification, expansion, and gene modification of appropriate effector cells. We therefore developed a novel expansion method that is simple, good manufacturing practice (GMP) -compatible, cost-effective (Paper I). For NK cell immunotherapy of patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (B-CLL), efficient NK cell expansion was obtained using the same method (Paper II). However, NK cell expansion rates were lower in cultures from patients with progressive B-CLL, demonstrating the negative effect of disease progression on NK cell expansion. In the same study (Paper II), it was also demonstrated that samples obtained from the same patients at different time points had similar NK expansion capacity, indicating reproducibility and also the reability of the method. In addition, in both studies it was shown {{that half of the}} expanded T cells possess an NK-like T (NKT) phenotype (CD 3 +CD 56 +). Moreover, using retroviral vector transduction, efficient gene transfer into primary human ex vivo expanded NK cells was demonstrated. Days 5 and 6 of expansion seem to be the best days for NK cell transduction (Paper III). In addition, the safety and the in vivo anti-tumour activity of human ex vivo expanded NK cells were evaluated against human K 562 cells in SCID-beige mice (Paper IV). Mice treated with expanded NK cells had significantly prolonged survival compared to the untreated group. Finally, NK and NKT cell populations that were expanded with GMP components were infused into patients with tumors. Such killer cells with or without IL- 2 injections were shown to be safe and to some extent had anti-tumor activity (Paper V). In conclusion, these studies have shown that NK as well as NKT cell expansion is possible with such a simple, cost effective and easy-to-use method. We were able to expand and <b>gene-modify</b> with retroviral vectors NK cells directly from the peripheral blood of both healthy donors and patients with B-CLL and show that NK cells can eradicate tumour cells in vivo. This may open new possibilities for current and future cell- and gene therapy approaches...|$|R
40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is a severe hereditary disorder {{caused by a}} loss of dystrophin, an essential musculoskeletal protein. Decades of promising research have yielded only modest gains in survival {{and quality of life}} for these patients and there have been no approved gene therapies for DMD to date. There are two significant hurdles to creating effective gene therapies for DMD; it is difficult to deliver a replacement dystrophin gene due to its large size and current strategies to restore the native dystrophin gene likely require life-long administration of a <b>gene-modifying</b> drug. This thesis presents a novel method to address these challenges through restoring dystrophin expression by genetically correcting the native dystrophin gene using engineered nucleases that target one or more exons in a mutational hotspot in exons 45 - 55 of the dystrophin gene. Importantly, this hotspot mutational region collectively represents approximately 62 % of all DMD mutations. In this work, we utilize various engineered nuclease platforms to create genetic modifications that can correct a variety of DMD patient mutations. Initially, we demonstrate that genome editing can efficiently correct the dystrophin reading frame and restore protein expression by introducing micro-frameshifts in exon 51, which is adjacent to a hotspot mutational region in the dystrophin gene. Transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs) were engineered to mediate highly efficient gene editing after introducing a single TALEN pair targeted to exon 51 of the dystrophin gene. This led to restoration of dystrophin protein expression in cells from DMD patients, including skeletal myoblasts and dermal fibroblasts that were reprogrammed to the myogenic lineage by MyoD. We show that our engineered TALENs have minimal cytotoxicity and exome sequencing of cells with targeted modifications of the dystrophin locus showed no TALEN-mediated off-target changes to the protein coding regions of the genome, as predicted by in silico target site analysis. In an alternative approach, we capitalized on the recent advances in genome editing to generate permanent exclusion of exons by using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) to selectively remove sequences important in specific exon recognition. This strategy has the advantage of creating predictable frame restoration and protein expression, although it relies on simultaneous nuclease activity to generate genomic deletions. ZFNs were designed to remove essential splicing sequences in exon 51 of the dystrophin gene and thereby exclude exon 51 from the resulting dystrophin transcript, a method that can potentially restore the dystrophin reading frame in up to 13 % of DMD patients. Nucleases were assembled by extended modular assembly and context-dependent assembly methods and screened for activity in human cells. Selected ZFNs had moderate observable cytotoxicity and one ZFN showed off-target activity at two chromosomal loci. Two active ZFN pairs flanking the exon 51 splice acceptor site were transfected into DMD patient cells and a clonal population was isolated with this region deleted from the genome. Deletion of the genomic sequence containing the splice acceptor resulted in the loss of exon 51 from the dystrophin mRNA transcript and restoration of dystrophin expression in vitro. Furthermore, transplantation of corrected cells into the hind limb of immunodeficient mice resulted in efficient human dystrophin expression localized to the sarcolemma. Finally, we exploited the increased versatility, efficiency, and multiplexing capabilities of the CRISPR/Cas 9 system to enable a variety of otherwise challenging gene correction strategies for DMD. Single or multiplexed sgRNAs were designed to restore the dystrophin reading frame by targeting the mutational hotspot at exons 45 - 55 and introducing either intraexonic small insertions and deletions, or large deletions of one or more exons. Significantly, we generated a large deletion of 336 kb across the entire exon 45 - 55 region that is applicable to correction of approximately 62 % of DMD patient mutations. We show that, for selected sgRNAs, CRISPR/Cas 9 gene editing displays minimal cytotoxicity and limited aberrant mutagenesis at off-target chromosomal loci. Following treatment with Cas 9 nuclease and one or more sgRNAs, dystrophin expression was restored in Duchenne patient muscle cells in vitro. Human dystrophin was detected in vivo following transplantation of genetically corrected patient cells into immunodeficient mice. In summary, the objective of this work was to develop methods to genetically correct the native dystrophin as a potential therapy for DMD. These studies integrate the rapid advances in gene editing technologies to create targeted frameshifts that restore the dystrophin gene around patient mutations in non-essential coding regions. Collectively, this thesis presents several gene editing methods that can correct patient mutations by modification of specific exons or by deletion of one or more exons that results in restoration of the dystrophin reading frame. Importantly, the gene correction methods described here are compatible with leading cell-based therapies and in vivo gene delivery strategies for DMD, providing an avenue towards a cure for this devastating disease.

40|$|The in vivo {{persistence}} of <b>gene-modified</b> cells can {{be limited by}} host immune responses to transgene-encoded proteins. In this study we evaluated in a nonhuman primate model whether the administration of a nonmyeloablative regimen consisting of low-dose total-body irradiation with 200 cGy followed by immunosuppression with mycophenolate mofetil and cyclosporin A for 28 and 35 days, respectively, {{could be used to}} facilitate {{persistence of}} autologous <b>gene-modified</b> T cells when a transgene-specific immune response had already been established or to induce long-lasting tolerance in unprimed recipients. Two macaques (Macaca nemestrina) received infusions of T cells transduced to express either the enhanced green fluorescent protein and neomycin phosphotransferase genes or the hygromycin phosphotransferase and herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase genes. In the absence of immunosuppression, both macaques developed potent class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted CD 8 + cytotoxic T-lymphocyte (CTL) responses that rapidly eliminated the <b>gene-modified</b> T cells and that persisted long term as memory CTL. Treatment with the nonmyeloablative regimen failed to abrogate preexisting memory CTL responses but interfered with the induction of transgene-specific CTL and facilitated in vivo persistence of <b>gene-modified</b> cells in an unprimed host. However, sustained tolerance to <b>gene-modified</b> T cells was not achieved with this regimen, indicating that further modifications will be required to permit sustained persistence of <b>gene-modified</b> T cells...|$|E
40|$|HIV entry inhibitors {{are highly}} {{effective}} in controlling virus replication. We {{have developed a}} lentiviral vector that expresses a secreted entry inhibitor, soluble CD 4 (sCD 4), which binds to the HIV envelope glycoproteins and inactivates the virus. We have shown that sCD 4 was secreted from <b>gene-modified</b> CD 4 + T cells, {{as well as from}} human umbilical cord blood-derived CD 34 + hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs), and protected unmodified HIV target cells from infection in vitro. To investigate the in vivo application of our approach, we injected <b>gene-modified</b> HSPCs into NOD/SCID/γcnull (NSG) mice. NSG hosts supported multi-lineage differentiation of human <b>gene-modified</b> HSPCs. Upon challenge with HIV, humanized mice capable of secreting sCD 4 demonstrated a reduction of viral load over time compared to control humanized mice. In contrast to gene therapy approaches that render only <b>gene-modified</b> HIV target cells resistant to infection, our approach also showed protection of unmodified CD 4 + T cells in the peripheral blood and tissues. Our findings provide support for the continuous delivery of secreted entry inhibitors via gene therapy as an alternative to oral administration of antiretroviral drugs or injection of antiretroviral proteins, including antibodies...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to expand the applications of MyoD-forced myogenesis for research and diagnosis of human muscle disorders using a lentiviral vector (LVhMyoD) for efficient trans-differentiation of patient primary cells. LVhMyoD transduced cells readily formed striated, multinucleate myotubes expressing a wide range of genes associated with muscular dystrophy (dystrophin, dysferlin, sarcoglycans, caveolin- 3) and congenital myopathy (nebulin, actin, desmin, tropomyosin, troponin). We demonstrate that MyoD <b>gene-modified</b> fibroblasts reproduce protein deficiencies associated with different forms of muscular dystrophy, and confirm that LVhMyoD <b>gene-modified</b> chorionic villus can be used successfully to determine the dystrophin status of the developing fetus, augmenting prenatal diagnosis of dystrophinopathy patients. Using muscle-specific cDNA derived from LVhMyoD <b>gene-modified</b> patient cells, we identified a female carrier bearing a large dystrophin deletion and a previously unidentified non-coding splice-site mutation within dystrophin in a Becker muscular dystrophy patient. This study highlights the significant potential of lentiviral MyoD-forced myogenesis for study of a wide range of human muscle disorders; a field constrained by the limited availability of human tissue. LVhMyoD <b>gene-modified</b> patient cells provide a renewable source of mutant protein and muscle-specific mRNA, facilitating accelerated mutation screening of large genes, molecular analyses of splicing abnormalities and study of disease-causing mutation...|$|E

We examined the long-term safety of MGMTP 140 K selection in a clinically relevant dog model. Based on the association of provirus integration and proto-oncogene activation leading to leukemia in the X-linked immunodeficiency trial, we focused our analysis {{on the distribution of}} retrovirus integration sites (RIS) relative to proto-oncogene transcription start sites (TSS). We analyzed RIS near proto-oncogene TSS before (n = 157) and after (n = 129) chemotherapy in dogs that received MGMTP 140 K <b>gene-modified</b> cells and identified no overall increase of RIS near proto-oncogene TSS after chemotherapy. We also wanted to determine whether in vivo selected cells retained fundamental characteristics of hematopoietic stem cells. To that end, we performed secondary transplantation of MGMTP 140 K <b>gene-modified</b> cells after in vivo selection in dog leukocyte antigen (DLA) –matched dogs. <b>Gene-modified</b> cells achieved multilineage repopulation, and we identified the same <b>gene-modified</b> clone in both dogs more than 800 and 900 days after transplantation. These data suggest that MGMTP 140 K selection is well tolerated and should allow clinically for selection of gene-corrected cells in genetic or infectious diseases or chemoprotection for treatment of malignancy...|$|E
40|$|The in vivo imaging of mice {{makes it}} {{possible}} to analyze disease progress non-invasively through reporter gene expression. As the removal of hair improves the accuracy of in vivo imaging, <b>gene-modified</b> mice with a reporter gene are often crossed with Hos:HR- 1 mutant mice homozygous for the spontaneous Hrhr mutation that exhibit a hair loss phenotype. However, it is time consuming to produce mice carrying both the reporter gene and mutant Hrhr gene by mating. In addition, there is a risk that genetic background of the <b>gene-modified</b> mice would be altered by mating. To resolve these issues, we established a simple method to generate hairless mice maintaining the original genetic background by CRISPR technology. First, we constructed the pX 330 vector, which targets exon 3 of Hr. This DNA vector (5 ng/µl) was microinjected into the pronuclei of C 57 BL/ 6 J mice. Induced Hr gene mutations were found in many founders (76. 1 %) and these mutations were heritable. Next, we performed in vivo imaging using these <b>gene-modified</b> hairless mice. As expected, luminescent objects in their body were detected by in vivo imaging. This study clearly showed that hairless mice could be simply generated by the CRISPR/Cas 9 system, and this method may be useful for in vivo imaging studies with various <b>gene-modified</b> mice...|$|E
40|$|The main {{approach}} to reduce graft rejection {{has been focused}} on the development of immunosuppressive agents at present. Although these strategies have reportedly reduced graft rejection, there has been a reciprocal increase in more severe immunosuppression and lethal infections, as well as severe side effects. Blockade of costimulatory T cell response has been proved as one of useful strategies to reduce graft rejection. Furthermore, {{it has been shown that}} infusion of dendritic cells (DCs) with a potent negative regulatory ability for T cells could prolong allograft survival. In this study mouse DCs (mDCs) were transfected with the recombinant plasmid pcDNA 3. 0 containing mouse inducible costimulator-Ig (mICOS-Ig) cDNA by electroporation. The transient expression of mICOS-Ig in mDC could be detected by ELISA and SDS-PAGE. Mouse ICOS-Ig fusion protein expressed in mDC and mICOS-Ig <b>gene-modified</b> mDC could inhibit lymphocyte proliferation in mixed lymphocyte culture (MLC) in vitro.

40|$|Objective: This study aims to {{investigate}} the potentially protective effect of neuroglobin (Ngb) <b>gene-modified</b> bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMSCs) on traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI) in rabbits. Methods: A lentiviral vector containing an Ngb gene was constructed and used to deliver Ngb to BMSCs. Ngb <b>gene-modified</b> BMSCs were then injected at the SCI sites 24 hours after SCI. The motor functions of the rabbits were evaluated by the Basso–Beattie–Bresnahan rating scale. Fluorescence microscopy, quantitative real-time PCRs, Western blots, malondialdehyde (MDA) tests, and terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-mediated UTP end labeling assays were also performed. Results: Ngb expression in the Ngb-BMSC group increased significantly. A more significant functional improvement was observed in the Ngb-BMSC group compared {{with those in the}} other groups. Traumatic SCI seemingly led to an increase in MDA level and number of apoptotic cells, which can be prevented by Ngb-BMSC treatment. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that Ngb <b>gene-modified</b> BMSCs can strengthen the therapeutic benefits of BMSCs in reducing secondary damage and improving the neurological outcome after traumatic SCI. Therefore, the combined strategy of BMSC transplantation and Ngb gene therapy can be used to treat traumatic SCI...|$|E
40|$|Accumulating {{clinical}} {{evidence suggests that}} adoptive T-cell immunotherapy could be a promising option for control of cancer; evident examples include the graft-vs-leukemia effect mediated by donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) and therapeutic infusion of ex vivo-expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) for melanoma. Currently, along with advances in synthetic immunology, <b>gene-modified</b> T cells retargeted to defined tumor antigens have been introduced as “cellular drugs”. As the functional properties of the adoptive immune response mediated by T lymphocytes are decisively regulated by their T-cell receptors (TCRs), transfer of genes encoding target antigen-specific receptors should enable polyclonal T cells to be uniformly redirected toward cancer cells. Clinically, anticancer adoptive immunotherapy using genetically engineered T cells has an impressive track record. Notable examples include the dramatic benefit of chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) <b>gene-modified</b> T cells redirected towards CD 19 in patients with B-cell malignancy, and the encouraging results obtained with TCR <b>gene-modified</b> T cells redirected towards NY-ESO- 1, a cancer-testis antigen, in patients with advanced melanoma and synovial cell sarcoma. This article overviews {{the current status of}} this treatment option, and discusses challenging issues that still restrain the full effectiveness of this strategy, especially in the context of hematological malignancy...|$|E
40|$|Advances in genetic {{engineering}} {{have made it}} possible to generate human T-cell products that carry desired functionalities, such as the ability to recognize cancer cells. The currently used strategies for the generation of <b>gene-modified</b> T-cell products lead to highly differentiated cells within the infusion product, and on the basis of data obtained in preclinical models, this is likely to impact the efficacy of these products. We set out to develop a good manufacturing practice (GMP) protocol that yields T-cell receptor (TCR) <b>gene-modified</b> T-cells with more favorable properties for clinical application. Here, we show the robust clinical-scale production of human peripheral blood T-cells with an early memory phenotype that express a MART- 1 -specific TCR. By combining selection and stimulation using anti-CD 3 /CD 28 beads for retroviral transduction, followed by expansion in the presence of IL- 7 and IL- 15, production of a well-defined clinical-scale TCR <b>gene-modified</b> T-cell product could be achieved. A major fraction of the T-cells generated in this fashion were shown to coexpress CD 62 L and CD 45 RA, and express CD 27 and CD 28, indicating a central memory or memory stemlike phenotype. Furthermore, these cells produced IFNγ, TNFα, and IL- 2 and displayed cytolytic activity against target cells expressing the relevant antigen. The T-cell products manufactured by this robust and validated GMP production process are now undergoing testing in a phase I/IIa clinical trial in HLA-A* 02 : 01 MART- 1 -positive advanced stage melanoma patients. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical trial protocol in which the combination of IL- 7 and IL- 15 has been applied for the generation of <b>gene-modified</b> T-cell products...|$|E

To exam ine the feasibility of cytokine gene transfer into human renal cancer (RC) cells, we introduced the cDNAs for human interleukin- 2 (I 1. - 2) or interferon- 7 (IFN- 7) into various RC cell lines with retroviral vectors. Using the NIH 3 T 3 amplification assay, no replication competent ret roviral particles were detectable in cell culture supernatants taken from <b>gene-modified</b> RC cell lines.

40|$|Clinical {{application}} of gene therapy for genetic and malignant diseases {{has been limited}} by inefficient stem cell gene transfer. Here we studied in a clinically relevant canine model whether genetic chemoprotection mediated by a mutant of the DNA-repair enzyme methylguanine methyltransferase could circumvent this limitation. We hypothesized that genetic chemoprotection might {{also be used to}} enhance allogeneic stem cell transplantation, and thus we evaluated methylguanine methyltransferase–mediated chemoprotection in an allogeneic setting. We demonstrate that <b>gene-modified</b> allogeneic canine CD 34 + cells can engraft even after low-dose total body irradiation conditioning. We also show that cytotoxic drug treatment produced a significant and sustained multilineage increase in <b>gene-modified</b> repopulating cells. Marking in granulocytes rose to levels of up to 98 %, the highest in vivo marking reported to date to our knowledge in any large-animal or human study. Increases in transgene-expressing cells after in vivo selection provided protection from chemotherapy-induced myelosuppression, and proviral integration site analysis demonstrated the protection of multiple repopulating clones. Drug treatment also resulted in an increase in donor chimerism. These data demonstrate that durable, therapeutically relevant in vivo selection and chemoprotection of <b>gene-modified</b> cells can be achieved in a large-animal model and suggest that chemoprotection {{can also be used to}} enhance allogeneic stem cell transplantation...|$|E
40|$|Reduced {{intensity}} conditioning (RIC) {{is desirable}} for {{hematopoietic stem cell}} (HSC) gene therapy applications. However, low gene marking was previously observed in gene therapy trials, suggesting that RIC might be insufficient for (i) opening niches for efficient engraftment and/or (ii) inducing immunological tolerance for transgene-encoded proteins. Therefore, we evaluated both engraftment and tolerance for <b>gene-modified</b> cells using our rhesus HSC gene therapy model following RIC. We investigated a dose de-escalation of total body irradiation (TBI) from our standard dose of 10 Gy (10, 8, 6, and 4 Gy), in which rhesus CD 34 + cells were transduced with a VSVG-pseudotyped chimeric HIV- 1 vector encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) (or enhanced yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)). At ∼ 6 months after transplantation, higher-dose TBI resulted in higher gene marking with logarithmic regression in peripheral blood cells. We then evaluated immunological tolerance for <b>gene-modified</b> cells, and found that lower-dose TBI allowed vigorous anti-GFP antibody production with logarithmic regression, while no significant anti-VSVG antibody formation was observed among all TBI groups. These data suggest that higher-dose TBI improves both engraftment and immunological tolerance for <b>gene-modified</b> cells. Additional immunosuppression might be required in RIC to induce tolerance for transgene products. Our findings should be valuable for developing conditioning regimens for HSC gene therapy applications...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{clinical}} trials in HIV-infected patients involving infusion of T cells protected by an antiviral gene {{have failed to}} show any therapeutic beneﬁt. The value of such a treatment approach is thus still highly controversial. In this study, the anticipated effects of <b>gene-modiﬁed</b> cells on virus and T-cell kinetics are analysed by mathematical modeling. Because technically {{only a small fraction}} of all T cells in a patient can be manipulated ex vivo, therapeutic success will depend on the accumulation of <b>gene-modiﬁed</b> cells after infusion into the patient by in vivo selection. Our simulations predict that a signiﬁcant therapeutic beneﬁt is conferred only by antiviral genes that inhibit HIV replication before virus integration (class I genes). Genes that inhibit viral protein expression (class II, used in previous {{clinical trials}}), require a much higher inhibitory activity than class I genes to promote the regeneration of T cells and reduce the viral load. Inhibition of virus assembly and release alone (class III) confers no selective advantage to the T cell and is therefore ineffective unless combined with class I (or, possibly, class II) genes. Also crucial in determining the clinical outcome are the regenerative capacity of the <b>gene-modiﬁed</b> cells and the level of HIV replication in the patient. These results can be important for guiding future strategies in the ﬁeld of gene therapy for HIV infection...|$|E
40|$|Background: There is {{currently}} no effective AIDS vaccine, emphasizing {{the importance of}} developing alternative therapies. Recently, a patient was successfully transplanted with allogeneic, naturally resistant CCR 5 -negative (CCR 5 D 32) cells, {{setting the stage for}} transplantation of naturally resistant, or genetically modified stem cells as a viable therapy for AIDS. Hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) gene therapy using vectors that express various anti-HIV transgenes has also been attempted in clinical trials, but inefficient gene transfer in these studies has severely limited the potential of this approach. Here we evaluated HSC gene transfer of an anti-HIV vector in the pigtailed macaque (Macaca nemestrina) model, which closely models human transplantation. Methods and Findings: We used lentiviral vectors that inhibited both HIV- 1 and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) /HIV- 1 (SHIV) chimera virus infection, and also expressed a P 140 K mutant methylguanine methyltransferase (MGMT) transgene to select <b>gene-modified</b> cells by adding chemotherapy drugs. Following transplantation and MGMT-mediated selection we demonstrated transgene expression in over 7 % of stem-cell derived lymphocytes. The high marking levels allowed us to demonstrate protection from SHIV in lymphocytes derived from <b>gene-modified</b> macaque long-term repopulating cells that expressed an HIV- 1 fusion inhibitor. We observed a statistically significant 4 -fold increase of <b>gene-modified</b> cells after challenge of lymphocytes from one macaque that received stem cells transduced with an anti-HIV vector (p, 0. 02, Student’...|$|E
40|$|Recently, {{cytokine}} {{gene transfer}} into tumour cells {{has been shown}} to mediate tumour regression in animal models via immunomodulation. Consequently, a number of clinical protocols have been developed to treat cancer patients with cytokine <b>gene-modified</b> tumour cells. Here, we report the results of a clinical phase I trial using for the first time autologous, interleukin 7 <b>gene-modified</b> tumour cells for vaccination of ten patients with disseminated malignant melanoma. Melanoma cells were expanded in vitro from surgically removed metastases, transduced by a ballistic gene transfer technique and were then injected after in vitro irradiation s. c. at weekly intervals. Clinically, there was no major toxicity except for mild fever, and no major clinical response towards vaccination was observed. Eight of ten patients completed the initial three s. c. vaccinations and were eligible for immunological evaluation. Post vaccination, peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were found to contain an increased number of tumour-reactive proliferative as well as cytolytic cells, as determined by a limiting dilution analysis. In three of six patients, the frequencies of anti-melanoma cytolytic precursor cells increased between 2. 6 - and 28 -fold. Two of these patients showed a minor clinical response. Analysis of the autologous tumour cell vaccines regarding IL- 7 secretion after gene transfer, HLA class I and class II cell surface expression, secretion of immunosuppressive mediators (TGF-beta 1, IL- 10) and various melanoma-associated tumour antigens revealed a very diverse expression profile. In conclusion, vaccination using <b>gene-modified</b> autologous melanoma cells induced immunological changes in a group of advanced, terminally ill patients. These changes can be interpreted as an increased anti-tumour immune response. However, immunological modulation was most pronounced in patients in good physical condition. Therefore, patients with minimal tumour load or minimal residual disease might preferentially benefit from tumour cell vaccination in further studies.

To date, many efforts {{have been made to}} establish domesticated ungulate pluripotent ES cells from early embryos without success. Here, we report the generation of porcine-induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells using drug-inducible expression of defined factors. We showed that porcine iPS cells expressed alkaline phosphatase, SSEA 3, SSEA 4, Tra- 1 - 60, Tra- 1 - 81, Oct 3 / 4, Nanog, Sox 2, Rex 1 and CDH 1. Pig iPS cells expressed high levels of telomerase activity and showed normal karyotypes. These cells could differentiate into cell types of all three germ layers in vitro and in teratomas. Our study reveals properties of porcine pluripotent stem cells that may facilitate the eventual establishment of porcine ES cells. Moreover, the porcine iPS cells produced may be directly useful for the generation of precise <b>gene-modified</b> pigs...|$|E
40|$|Safely {{achieving}} long-term engraftment {{of genetically}} modified hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) that maintain therapeutic transgene expression is the benchmark for successful application of gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies. We used the pigtailed macaque HSC transplantation model to ascertain the long-term safety and stability of a γ-globin lentivirus vector. We observed stable <b>gene-modified</b> cells and fetal hemoglobin expression for 3 years. Retrovirus integration site (RIS) analysis spanning 6 months to 3. 1 years revealed vastly disparate integration profiles, and dynamic fluctuation of hematopoietic contribution from different <b>gene-modified</b> HSC clones without evidence for clonal dominance. There were no perturbations of the global gene-expression profile or expression of genes within a 300 kb region of RIS, including genes surrounding the most abundantly marked clones. Overall, a 3 -year long follow-up revealed no evidence of genotoxicity of the γ-globin lentivirus vector with multilineage polyclonal hematopoiesis, and HSC clonal fluctuations that were not associated with transcriptome dysregulation...|$|E

Gene modification of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) {{has the potential}} to cure genetic, malignant and acquired diseases. Despite success in pre-clinical gene therapy studies, achieving genetic correction or a therapeutic response in humans has been challenging. HIV- 1 -based lentivirus vectors have come to the forefront of pre-clinical studies due to their ability to more effectively transduce quiescent HSCs. Drug resistance gene expression coupled to chemotherapy after HSC transplantation may support in vivo selection of <b>gene-modified</b> cells while protecting the patient from chemotoxicity. We hypothesized that lentivirus-mediated transfer of a methotrexate (MTX) resistance gene, Tyr 22 -dihydrofolate reductase (Tyr 22 -DHFR), into stem cells would support long-term stable gene expression in vivo and protect hematopoietic daughter cells from MTX toxicity. To test our hypothesis, we first generated high-titer lentivirus vectors expressing Tyr 22 -DHFR and green fluorescent protein (GFP) in different genetic configurations, and then compared MTX resistance, enzyme activity and GFP fluorescence in mouse and human cell lines including human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Tyr 22 -DHFR-HSCs protected transplanted mice from MTX myelotoxicity, and conferred a significant survival advantage compared to MTX treated GFP-HSC transplanted mice. To assess the feasibility of a physiologic scale-up in a large animal model, we demonstrated DHFR-GFP expression in canine CD 34 + cells and long-term engraftment of <b>gene-modified</b> cells in vivo. MTX administration increased gene-marking in the peripheral blood of one dog, without causing cytopenia. We also defined the optimal priming of HSCs (c-G-CSF/c-SCF BM), transduction conditions and MTX tolerated doses in dogs. Finally, we present a novel application of selective expansion of hESCs-derived cells in mouse xenografts. Methotrexate-resistant (MTXr) -DHFR hESCs gave rise to MTXr-GFP+ teratomas, indicating that that <b>gene-modified</b> cells retain their pluripotency during MTX treatment. MTXr-hESCs placed in stromal cell co-culture differentiated into GFP+ hemato-endothelial cells, including CD 34 +CD 45 + subsets, which subsequently gave rise to MTXr-hematopoietic colony forming cells (CFCs). Finally, we showed that MTX administration of mice bearing hESC xenografts supported in vivo selection of Tyr 22 -DHFR-hESC-hematopoietic cells and increased engraftment of <b>gene-modified</b> cells in the bone marrow of treated mice. Taken together, these results show that lentivirus vectors effectively transduce MTXr-DHFR into HSCs, thereby preventing life-threatening myelotoxicity (as observed in our mouse studies), and supporting long-term engraftment of <b>gene-modified</b> cells in vivo. These studies mark significant progress of MTX resistance gene therapy toward clinical trials in humans...|$|E
40|$|Modern {{tendencies of}} {{recombinant}} microorganisms creation for obtaining on their basis a new effective biopreparations (probiotics) with wider spectrum of biological and therapeutic properties were considered.

The main created Ukrainian and foreign <b>gene-modified</b> strains, that are widely used today in creation of effective recombinant biopreparations were characterized. Some fundamental directions and methods of <b>gene-modified</b> strains obtaining, which are used in getting effective biopreparations that used for therapy and prophylactic illness were reported, under which this group of pharmaceutical drugs were not used earlier. The safety matters of probiotics using on basis of genemodified strains were examined. Medical and veterinary biopreparations on basis of recombinant microorganisms could be used directly and effectively for therapy and prophylaxis of different illness, beginning from disbacteriosis up to cardiovascular diseases.

40|$|Following the {{clinical}} success achieved {{with the first}} generation of adoptive cell therapy (ACT) utilizing in vitro expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs), the second and third generations of TIL ACT are evolving toward the use of genetically modified TIL. TIL therapy generally involves the transfer of a high number of TIL, ranging from 109 to 1011 cells. One of the technical difficulties in genetically modifying TIL, using a retroviral vector, is the ability to achieve large expansion of transduced TIL, while keeping the technique suitable to a Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) environment. Consequently, we developed and optimized a novel method for the efficient production of large numbers of GMP-grade, <b>gene-modified</b> TIL for the treatment of patients with ACT. The chemokine receptor CXCR 2 was used as the gene of interest for methodology development. The optimized procedure is currently used in the production of <b>gene-modified</b> TIL for two clinical trials for the treatment of metastatic melanoma at MD Anderson Cancer Center...|$|E
40|$|Current {{clinical}} therapies for critical-sized bone defects (CSBDs) remain {{far from}} ideal. Previous {{studies have demonstrated}} that engineering bone tissue using mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) is feasible. However, this approach is not effective for CSBDs due to inadequate vascularization. In our previous study, we have developed an injectable and porous nano calcium sulfate/alginate (nCS/A) scaffold and demonstrated that nCS/A composition is biocompatible and has proper biodegradability for bone regeneration. Here, we hypothesized that the combination of an injectable and porous nCS/A with bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP 2) <b>gene-modified</b> MSCs and endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) could significantly enhance vascularized bone regeneration. Our results demonstrated that delivery of MSCs and EPCs with the injectable nCS/A scaffold did not affect cell viability. Moreover, co-culture of BMP 2 <b>gene-modified</b> MSCs and EPCs dramatically increased osteoblast differentiation of MSCs and endothelial differentiation of EPCs in vitro. We further tested the multifunctional bone reconstruction system consisting of an injectable and porous nCS/A scaffold (mimicking the nano-calcium matrix of bone) and BMP 2 genetically-engineered MSCs and EPCs in a rat critical-sized (8 mm) caviarial bone defect model. Our in vivo results showed that, compared to the groups of nCS/A, nCS/A+MSCs, nCS/A+MSCs+EPCs and nCS/A+BMP 2 <b>gene-modified</b> MSCs, the combination of BMP 2 gene -modified MSCs and EPCs in nCS/A dramatically increased the new bone and vascular formation. These results demonstrated that EPCs increase new vascular growth, and that BMP 2 gene modification for MSCs and EPCs dramatically promotes bone regeneration. This system could ultimately enable clinicians to better reconstruct the craniofacial bone and avoid donor site morbidity for CSBDs...|$|E
40|$|Objective　To {{study the}} {{antibacterial}} and tissue reparative effect of BPI-BD 3 <b>gene-modified</b> mesenchymal stem cells in a mouse model of wound infection. Methods　C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells were transfected with recombinant adenovirus vector pAdxsi-BPI-BD 3, {{the expression of}} BPI-BD 3 fusion protein was verified by RT-PCR and Western blotting. Excision wound with a diameter of 1 cm was inoculated with Staphylococcus aureuswas made {{on the back of}} 30 mice. The mice were randomly divided into 3 groups (10 each). Mice in group T were injected with BPI-BD 3 <b>gene-modified</b> C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells through caudal vein, those in group C were injected with unmodified C 3 H 10 T 1 / 2 cells, and in group N were injected with PBS as control. The wound repair result was evaluated by estimation of the percentage of remaining wound area and the amount of wound bacteria under the scar, followed by observation of pathological changes. Inflammatory reactions of the wounds were assessed accordingly. Results　The amount of bacteria under the scar was less in group T than in the other two groups (P< 0. 05). It was also found that the wound healing process was faster in group T than in group C and group N. Pathological observation showed that the inflammatory reaction in group T was also significantly milder than in the other two groups. Conclusion　BPI-BD 3 <b>gene-modified</b> mesenchymal stem cells may enhance wound repair by controlling infection and promoting tissue regeneration, thus it may be promising in clinical application.
