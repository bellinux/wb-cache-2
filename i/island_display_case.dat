40|$|AbstractThe {{preservation}} of artworks is profoundly influenced by fluctuations in temperature and, especially, relative humidity. Thus, {{it is crucial}} for hygrothermal conditions in museums to be stabilized, particularly inside <b>display</b> <b>cases.</b> Today there are advanced hygrothermal simulation models available that enable us to quantify the temperature and relative humidity fluctuations of the air inside the museum <b>display</b> <b>cases,</b> provided that we know the climate in the exhibition rooms, the degree of ventilation of the <b>display</b> <b>case</b> and the constitution of its surroundings. However, the placement of hygroscopic materials inside <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> also influences the fluctuation of interior relative humidity. This paper {{presents the results of}} an experimental study conducted in a flow chamber, showing the enormous potential of hygroscopic materials in stabilizing relative humidity inside of <b>display</b> <b>cases.</b> In addition, it presents a numerical simulation study conducted in <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> evaluating how the insertion of hygroscopic finishing materials in the base of the <b>display</b> <b>case,</b> under varying ventilation conditions influences stabilization of interior relative humidity...|$|R

40|$|Only {{abstract}} of poster available. Track III: Energy InfrastructureRefrigerated <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> are {{utilized by}} supermarkets to store and display food products {{in a manner}} that extends food shelf life and ensures food safety. Supermarkets operate their refrigeration systems continuously to maintain proper food storage conditions. Continual operation of this refrigeration equipment on a nationwide scale accounts for approximately 0. 33 quads/yr of electrical energy. Infiltration accounts for over 70 % of the refrigeration load in open refrigerated <b>display</b> <b>cases.</b> Clearly, an increase in the energy efficiency of refrigerated <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> will result in significantly reduced energy consumption and cost. Thus, the objective of this project is to compare a typical open refrigerated <b>display</b> <b>case</b> to a typical glass-doored refrigerated <b>display</b> <b>case</b> with the aim of quantifying the following: •	The difference in overall energy consumption between the cases. •	The normalized difference in food product sales between the cases. Two supermarkets are being used as test sites, which are similarly situated to ensure that climate, weather, time-of-year and economic conditions of the shoppers are comparable. One supermarket will receive an open refrigerated <b>display</b> <b>case</b> and the other will receive a doored refrigerated <b>display</b> <b>case.</b> Each refrigerated <b>display</b> <b>case</b> will be a medium temperature, self-service prepackaged deli or beverage case between 8 and 25 nominal linear feet. The thermal performance and product sales of each refrigerated <b>display</b> <b>case</b> will be monitored. Automated data logging systems will be used to measure quantities such as refrigeration load, voltage, current, temperature, humidity and pressure. Product sales for each refrigerated <b>display</b> <b>case</b> and total store product sales will be tracked using Stock Keeping Units (SKUs) and the supermarkets' computerized Point of Sale (POS) system. The resulting data will be analyzed to determine the difference in energy consumption and product sales between the two refrigerated cases...|$|R

In this paper, the transitional relative humidity distribution in the <b>display</b> <b>case</b> are estimated under various conditions by solving three dimensional unsteady Navier-Stokes equations coupled with thermal and humidity transport equations. The results show that the unsteady relative humidity distribution in the airtight type <b>display</b> <b>case</b> is strongly affected by the air flow rate. The main cause of such relative humidity behavior is intensity of convection induced by the air ventilation of the <b>display</b> <b>case...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project {{was to determine the}} potential energy savings associated with implementing demand defrost strategies to defrost supermarket refrigerated <b>display</b> <b>case</b> evaporators, as compared to the widely accepted current practice of controlling <b>display</b> <b>case</b> defrost cycles with a preset timer. The defrost heater energy use of several representative <b>display</b> <b>case</b> types was evaluated. In addition, demand defrost strategies for refrigerated <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> as well as those used in residential refrigerator/freezers were evaluated. Furthermore, it is anticipated that future work will include identifying a preferred defrost strategy, with input from Retail Energy Alliance members. Based on this strategy, a demand defrost system will be designed which is suitable for supermarket refrigerated <b>display</b> <b>cases.</b> Limited field testing of the preferred defrost strategy will be performed in a supermarket environment...|$|R
40|$|The study {{concerns}} {{the reliability of}} active <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> to be used at the Dutch Maritime Museum located in Amsterdam. The paper presents HAM models of <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> and the indoor climate of the zone surrounding them. Furthermore, data from measurements arc provided for validation purposes. It is concluded that in case of failure of the climate system, responsible for the indoor climate surrounding the active <b>display</b> <b>case,</b> the climate inside the active <b>display</b> <b>case</b> will stay within the required limits {{for more than five}} hours during the winter and for more than half an hour during the summer. However, some undetected failure scenarios could be responsible for exceeding the required limits of the indoor climate inside the <b>display</b> <b>case</b> within five minutes. The latter shows the importance of the presence of reliable failure detection and handling system...|$|R

40|$|Horizontal {{refrigerated}} <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> {{consume a}} large amount of energy and interact closely with the indoor environment in supermarkets. How to design a high energy-efficient <b>display</b> <b>case</b> has long been an important task of the industry and an important topic for research. This paper uses the CFD method to evaluate the energy performance of the air curtain for horizontal refrigerated <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> and to optimize its design. The CFD method is also validated by comparing the CFD calculation results with experimental results. Using the CFD method, the key factors that influence the cooling load of the air curtain in the <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> are studied. Qualitative designs are then proposed to make the air curtain more energy-efficient. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|A {{simulation}} model for predicting {{the performance of}} a <b>display</b> <b>case</b> under frosting conditions has been developed. An experimentally validated heat exchanger {{simulation model}} for a secondary refrigerant was extended to simulate operation in open <b>display</b> <b>cases,</b> modeling the varying frost properties and operating conditions and their effect on heat exchanger performance. A separate model based on a few simplifying assumptions has been developed to simulate the defrosting, predict the time required to melt the frost mass (existing at the end of frosting cycle) and compressor and fan power requirements for an entire day operation of a <b>display</b> <b>case.</b> Two design strategies for reducing defrost frequency and overall energy consumption of open supermarket <b>display</b> <b>cases</b> were evaluated relative to the baseline (variable air flow as a consequence of fan characteristics) operation: constant air flow operation; and fin staging.
