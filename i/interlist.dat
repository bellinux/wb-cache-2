40|$|The human {{memory system}} is {{remarkable}} in {{its capacity to}} focus its search on items learned in a given context. This capacity can be so precise that many leading models of human memory assume that only those items learned {{in the context of}} a recently studied list compete for recall. We sought to extend the explanatory scope of these models to include not only intralist phenomena, such as primacy and recency effects, but also <b>interlist</b> phenomena such as proactive and retroactive interference. Building on retrieved temporal context models of memory search (e. g., Polyn, Norman, & Kahana, 2009), we present a substantially revised theory in which memory accumulates across multiple experimental lists, and temporal context is used both to focus retrieval on a target list, and to censor retrieved information when its match to the current context indicates that it was learned in a nontarget list. We show how the resulting model can simultaneously account for a wide range of intralist and <b>interlist</b> phenomena, including the pattern of prior-list intrusions observed in free recall, build-up of and release from proactive interference, and the ability to selectively target retrieval of items on specific prior lists (Jang & Huber, 2008; Shiffrin, 1970). In a new experiment, we verify that subjects ’ error monitoring processes are consistent with those predicted by the model...|$|E
40|$|The task {{of serial}} recall {{has become the}} touchstone for {{theories}} of short term memory. Many simple yet powerful computational models have been proposed to account for performance in the task. However, these models typically make only tangential reference to language processes, {{despite the fact that}} a key determinant of performance on the task {{is the extent to which}} the to-be-learned list mimics the structure of natural language (Miller & Selfridge 1950). The Syntagmatic Paradigmatic model (SP), a memory-based account of sentence processing, is applied to serial recall. Employing an alignment mechanism derived from String Edit Theory (SET; Sankoff & Kruskal 1983), the SP is able to account for the U shaped serial position curve, patterns of <b>interlist</b> and intralist intrusions and the multiply bowed serial position curve that occurs with grouped study lists...|$|E
40|$|The discriminative {{assumption}} on {{buildup of}} proactive interference in short-term memory predicts that when intertrial similarity of items is high, the proactive interference is built up while <b>interlist</b> similarity of items is low, the proactive interference is not built up. To test the discriminative assumption in Japanese Kanji learning, intertrial similarity was {{changed by the}} acoustic, the radical (as one of the figurative properties), and the radical plus semantic properties in Kanji. For the acoustic and the radical plus semantic properties, the proactive interference was built up in the non-discriminative list with high intertrial similarity but not built in the discriminative list with low intertrial similarity, which supported the prediction. The prediction was not supported for the radical property. The findings were discussed {{with reference to the}} discriminative function of these properties as memory cues...|$|E
40|$|The {{globalization}} of financial markets has seen ever-increasing numbers of firms choosing to list their stocks on foreign exchanges. We examine whether {{the extent of}} economic and financial market integration (or segmentation) between a firm's home country and listing country influences stock price reaction by examining the case of two “similar” countries: the U. S. and Canada. During the 100 days before the week of <b>interlisting</b> in the U. S., (risk-adjusted) stock prices of Canadian firms rise (on average) by over 9. 4 %, rise by an additional 2 % around the <b>interlisting</b> date, but follow with a corresponding drop of 9. 7 % in the 100 days after <b>interlisting.</b> We interpret this evidence {{to be consistent with}} the financial market segmentation between Canada and the U. S. However, a subsample of Canadian resource firms does not exhibit these stock price effects, suggesting industry-related factors may also be an important determinant of integration. We also find average trading volume in <b>interlisted</b> stocks more than doubles in the months following <b>interlisting.</b> © 1993 JIBS.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine {{financial}} integration across North American stock markets from January 1984 to December 2003. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses an arbitrage pricing theory framework. The risk factors considered are the three Fama and French factors augmented with momentum for both countries as well as their international counterparts. Both the domestic and international four factor models in cross section and test for partial, mild, and strong financial integration are estimated. The domestic and international model are estimated on domestic portfolios and on a subset of Canadian cross listings matched with American stocks. Findings – Results can be summarized as follows: first, results show stronger evidence of mild rather than partial or strong integration in both domestic portfolios and <b>interlisted</b> stocks. Second, <b>interlisted</b> stocks appear at first glance to be more integrated than the domestic portfolios, but this result can be attributed to the poor explanatory power of the models applied to <b>interlisted</b> stocks. Once the authors rule out the case where the model does not generate statistically important risk premiums for both countries, the evidence of integration is similar in both domestic and <b>interlisted</b> stocks. Third, the domestic and international models have similar explanatory power, although the domestic model performs better with the Canadian <b>interlisted</b> stocks are found. Originality/value – The results suggest that, in an international context, a portfolio manager is better off using the four factor model as a benchmark in cross sections rather than the single market. Furthermore, if the agency problem described in Karolyi is ignored, Canadian <b>interlisted</b> stocks and Canadian domestic portfolios have the same diversification potential.

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} and resolves {{the issue of}} microstructure noise when measuring {{the relative importance of}} home and U. S. market in the price discovery process of Canadian <b>interlisted</b> stocks. In order to avoid large bounds for information shares, previous studies applying the Cholesky decomposition within the Hasbrouck (1995) framework had to rely on high frequency data. However, due to the considerable amount of microstructure noise inherent in return data at very high frequencies, these estimators are distorted. We offer a modified approach that identifies unique information shares based on distributional assumptions and thereby enables us to control for microstructure noise. Our results indicate that the role of the U. S. market in the price discovery process of Canadian <b>interlisted</b> stocks has been underestimated so far. Moreover, we suggest that rather than stock specific factors, market characteristics determine information shares...|$|R
40|$|The {{investigator}} evaluated {{a commercially}} available Spanish word recognition ability test. The material {{consists of four}} lists of fifty bisyllabic tetraphonemic Spanish words available from Auditec of St. Louis as: "Spanish speech discrimination lists 1 - 4 ". <b>Interlist</b> equivalence, word difficulty, speaker's intelligibility, and P/I functions' slopes were investigated. Taped lists were presented to 16 normal hearing native Spanish speaking adults at four presentation levels. Statistical analysis indicated that the intelligibility of list three is significantly different than the other lists at the. 05 level. At the low presentation levels, subjects of Mexican origin obtained better scores than subjects of other nationalities. The P/I functions' slope (4. 3 %) was comparable to that obtained by investigators of English tests. Most frequently missed words have as common denominators: presence of the /s/ sound, and are words that retain their meaning even after deletion of final /s/.

40|$|A Markov {{model is}} {{proposed}} to measure storage loss and retrieval failure in retroactive inhibition. This model generalizes Batchelder and Riefer's (1986) storage-retrieval model {{to account for}} retroactive inhibition. Storage loss is assumed {{to result in a}} disintegration of clustered items, while retrieval failure is assumed to prevent access to clustered items. The model is tested against data from three free recall experiments in which categorized item lists were presented to subjects. The kind of item categorization (conceptual vs. phonemic-orthographic) and the <b>interlist</b> similarity (different vs. identical categories) were manipulated across experiments. The model fits the data of all three experiments well, thus supporting the central inhibition concepts of the model. Based on these inhibition concepts and the parameter estimates of the model conclusions are drawn on the issue of whether retroactive inhibition is due to storage loss or retrieval failure in this experimental situation. In addition, rates of storage loss and retrieval failure are compared across the experiments. This latter analysis is discussed {{as an example of how}} the model reveals information about retroactive inhibition in ways that the storage-retrieval model cannot...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{semantic}} properties {{of a class}} of illusions, of which the Deese/Roediger-McDermott (DRM) paradigm is the most prominent example, in which subjects falsely remember words that are associates of studied words. We analyzed DRM materials for 16 dimensions of semantic content and assessed the ability of these dimensions to predict <b>interlist</b> variability in false memory. For the more general class of illusions, we analyzed pairs of presented and unpresented words that varied in associative strength {{for the presence of}} these same 16 semantic properties. DRM materials proved to be exceptionally rich in meaning, as indexed by these semantic properties. Variability in false recall, false recognition, and backward associative strength loaded on a single semantic factor (familiarity/meaningfulness), whereas variability in true recall loaded on a quite different factor (imagery/concreteness). For word association generally, 15 semantic properties varied reliably with forward or backward association between words. Implications for semantic versus associative processing in this class of illusions, for dual-process theories, and for semantic properties of word associations are discussed...|$|E

However, estimation techniques that place more weight on distant firms (e. g. kernel-based matching) have better testing power and produce tighter confidence intervals when there are few matched pairs. For stocks listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange, we employ these techniques to estimate the impact of US <b>interlisting</b> on percentage bid-ask spreads, institutional and market maker participation rates, and market maker profits.

40|$|The extinction-recovery theory, {{which has}} been offered {{to account for the}} {{superior}} retention of paired-associate lists learned under distributed practice (DP), was tested in three experiments. These studies showed that (a) prior-list availability is unaffected by DP, (b) the DP effect is largely due to increased availability, and (c) a DP effect can occur under conditions of minimal <b>interlist</b> interference. These findings were considered severely damaging to the theory. The results of these and other studies were interpreted in terms of the operation of a selection process by which DP Ss are able to acquire a collection of relatively stable and strong associations. Recent research has continued to support the conclusion that retention is largely a function of degree of learning and that variables which produce large differences in learning, e. g., meaningfulness, similarity, and individual differences, have little or no influence upon rate of forgetting (Underwood, 1964). One apparent exception to this conclusion is the facilitative effect on retention of distributed practice (DP) administered during learning. Specifically, retention of the last in a serie...|$|E
40|$|Cochlear implant (CI) {{recipients}} usually {{complain about}} poor speech understanding {{in the presence}} of noise. Indeed, they generally show ceiling effects for understanding sentences presented in quiet, but their scores decrease drastically when testing {{in the presence of}} competing noise. One important aspect that contributes to speech perception skills, especially when listening in a fluctuating background, has been described as Temporal Fine Structure (TFS) processing. TFS cues are more dominant in conveying Low Frequency (LF) signals linked in particular to Fundamental Frequency (F 0), which is crucial for linguistic and musical perception. A§E Harmonic Intonation (HI) and Disharmonic Intonation (DI) are tests of pitch perception in the LF domain and their outcomes are believed to depend on the availability of TFS cues. Previous findings indicated that the DI test provided more differential LF pitch perception outcomes in that it reflected phase locking and TFS processing capacities of the ear, whereas the HI test provided information on its place coding capacity as well. Previous HI/DI studies were mainly done in adult population showing abnormal pitch perception outcomes in CI recipients and there was no or limited data in paediatric population as well as HI/DI outcomes in relation to speech perception outcomes in the presence of noise. One of the primary objectives of this thesis has been to investigate LF pitch perception skills in a group of pediatric CI recipients in comparison to normal hearing (NH) children. Another objective was to introduce a new assessment tool, the Italian STARR test which was based on measurement of speech perception using a roving-level adaptive method where the presentation level of both speech and noise signals varied across sentences. The STARR test attempts to reflect a better representation of real world listening conditions where background noise is usually present and speech intensity varies according to vocal capacity as well as the distance of the speaker. The Italian STARR outcomes in NH adults were studied to produce normative data, as well as to evaluate <b>interlist</b> variability and learning effects. Finally, LF pitch perception outcomes linked to availability of TFS were investigated in a group of adult CI recipients including bimodal users in relation to speech perception, in particular Italian STARR outcomes. Results were interesting: Although the majority of CI recipient children showed abnormal outcomes for A§E, their scores were considerably better than in the adult CI users. Age had a statistically significant effect on performance in both children and adults; younger children and older adults tended to show poorer performance. Similarly, CI recipient adults (even the better performers) showed abnormal STARR outcomes in comparison to NH subjects and group differences were statistically significant. The duration of profound deafness before implantation had a significant effect on STARR performance. On the other hand, the significant effect of CI thresholds re-emphasized the sensitivity of the test to lower level speech which a CI user can face very often during everyday life. Analysis revealed statistically significant correlations between HI/DI and STARR performance. Moreover, contralateral hearing aid users showed significant bimodal benefit for both HI/DI and STARR tests. Overall findings confirmed the usefulness of evaluating both LF pitch and speech perception in order to track changes in TFS sensitivity for CI recipients over time and across different listening conditions which might be provided by future technological advances as well as to study individual differences...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on a {{presentation}} made at the New York Stock Exchange Conference on the Future of Global Equity Trading, March 12, 2004, Sarasota, FL. Looking back, was it a momentary enthusiasm? The dramatic increase in cross-listed securities, particularly in the United States, was one of the remarkable phenomena of the 1990 s capital markets. The bonding, or corporate governance, hypothesis was one of the more intriguing theories to surface to explain the phenomenon. Cross-listing, the hypothesis suggested, might be a bonding mechanism by which firms, incorporated in a jurisdiction with “weak protection” of minority shareholder rights or poor enforcement mechanisms, could voluntarily subject themselves to higher disclosure standards and stricter enforcement of the US markets in order to attract investors. By focusing on shareholder protection as key to cross-listing, the bonding hypothesis became inextricably linked to an important and influential body of academic work, the “law and finance” literature. As intriguing as the bonding hypothesis is, this article argues that it offers only a partial explanation for the cross-listing phenomenon in the United States in the 1990 s. Largely overlooked has been the main motor driving the exponential growth of cross-listings on the NYSE and NASDAQ in the 1990 s: Canadian-based <b>interlisted</b> corporations (CBIs). CBIs form the largest single group of <b>interlisted</b> foreign corporations in the United States, by a huge margin, representing over 25 % all interlistings on the NYSE, NMS-NASDAQ and AMEX in 2004. In fact, Canadian issuers form the largest single group of foreign private issuers (FPIs) in the United States, period. In 2004, there were nearly five times as many Canadian FPIs as the next largest national group, United Kingdom issuers. The bonding hypothesis does not explain CBIs easily. CBIs do not come from a “weak investor protection” jurisdiction and, {{for a variety of reasons}} and in a number of ways, tend not to “signal” their entry into the US market. Rather than “bonding”, CBIs have been adroitly exploiting what financial economists have described as the “home bias” of U. S portfolio investors. CBIs have been, at least until very recently, chameleons, deliberately blending into the woodwork of the US markets. This article will look at what makes CBIs different from most other <b>interlisted</b> companies and why the bonding hypothesis may not be explanatory of their behavior. In doing so, the article questions some of the underlying assumptions of the law and finance literature which supports the bonding hypothesis. Finally, the article considers implications of the CBI experience which may merit further consideration going forward...|$|R
40|$|This paper applies a {{game theory}} {{approach}} {{to examine the}} effects of a market structure change in options trading from a monopoly to a Cournot-type oligopoly that occurred in two successive periods on the Montreal exchange. We analyze the intra-day behaviour of option bid-ask spreads and find that cross-listing has a differential impact on spreads, affecting quoted but not effective spreads under oligopoly. We also find that the impact of the change in structure on effective spreads comes mostly from an increase in limit orders and is consistent with a switch from Cournot to Bertrand-type strategic behaviour for such orders. We conclude that market structure effects within an options exchange are enough to realize most of the benefits of inter-market competition even in the context of market thinness.

40|$|This thesis, {{comprised}} of three essays, concentrates on price discovery and the properties associated with transactions and quotes surrounding trading halts on the Montreal (ME) and Toronto Stock Exchanges (TSE). Trading halts are imposed by exchanges on listed securities, namely; {{in response to}} informed trading {{at the expense of}} uninformed traders, in order to force companies to comply with proper and quick news dissemination, and in response to large depth imbalances. Since the maintenance of a fair and orderly market is the desired mandate of stock exchanges, the successful implementation of trading halts should reduce informational asymmetry surrounding specific announcements. The first essay examines price discovery on the ME. It extends previous literature by examining returns, volatilities and trade activity over time and finds that trading halts are effective in disseminating news in a fair and orderly manner. Although most adverse information effects subside within a few hours of the resumption of trading, trading haft effectiveness varies somewhat over time. Volatility and trading activity preceding the trading haft are quickly impounded into prices post-halt. The second assay investigates trade activity, direction, spreads, depths and volatility for stocks <b>interlisted</b> on the ME and TSE. Results indicate that asymmetric information impacts on both the market and the specialist covering the hafted security. Specialists adjust their supply of liquidity around the trading halts and informed traders are less active prior to the trading halts. Although trade activity, spreads and volatility increase after trading resumes, only trade activity partially remains at its new higher level permanently. The final essay decomposes the components of the bid/ask spread and examines specialist behaviour and quote/transaction revisions for stocks <b>interlisted</b> on the ME and TSE. Results indicate that specialists attempt to clear themselves of unwanted inventories accumulated around bad news announcements, by adjusting spreads and depths intraday to quickly dispose of unwanted inventory. Although asymmetric information is the largest component of the quoted spread around trading halts, severe biases are uncovered in component estimation. These are attributed to the use of serial covariance estimates in component estimation for some of the models currently used in the literature...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{examine how}} the {{valuation}} multiples assigned to the equity of Canadian-listed firms compare with the equity of comparable firms listed in the United States. They find that Canadian-listed firms trade at a discount to U. S. -listed firms {{across a range of}} valuation measures. Differences in accounting do not explain this discount, based on a comparison of Canadian <b>interlisted</b> firms that report under both Canadian and U. S. generally accepted accounting principles. This discount exists despite Canadian-listed firms having a lower cost of equity and higher profitability than comparable U. S-listed firms. Consistent with theory, part of the differences in valuation are explained by company-specific factors, such as industry, firm size, cost of equity, or profitability. The authors also find that characteristics of the stock market where the share is listed affect valuation, such as secondary market liquidity and the relative performance of the overall equity market. They find that a country discount persists after controlling for these company-specific and market-specific factors, which suggests that Canadian and U. S. financial markets remain segmented.

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{new insight}} into how information is disseminated when markets are subject to short sales restrictions by examining the relationship between short interest and returns for Canadian stocks. Short interest is defined in relation to trading volume because volume reflects information in the market. The results strongly support the assertion that short sales reflect bad news in Canada. The paper further finds that short sales convey more negative information for small firms because the supply of shortable shares is more constrained for these firms. In addition, short sales are less informative for stocks with associated options because the option market enhances the informational efficiency of the stock market. Importantly, {{the evidence suggests that}} informed traders short sell <b>interlisted</b> stocks in Canada, rather than the U. S., to exploit lower execution costs. Thus, short sales in Canada are more informative than in the U.

Spreads increase during Canadian or United States (US) partial holidays.

For Canadian securities that are <b>interlisted</b> on US exchanges, there are days when US exchanges are closed while Canadian Exchanges are open (US partial holidays) and other days when US exchanges are open while Canadian Exchanges are closed (Canadian partial holidays).

We examine how the temporary closure of one market affects the spread and information asymmetry on the other market. Cheung and Kwan (1992) examine trading on the NYSE and the TSX during partial holidays. They show market volatility based on index returns and total volume based on total market activity will decrease significantly in the Canadian market during US partial holidays. In contrast, during Canadian partial holidays the NYSE will experience an insignificant decrease in the volatility and a significant de-crease in the volume...|$|R
40|$|Recently, many {{authors have}} noted {{anomalies}} in risk adjusted returns {{as measured by}} the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). The majority of these studies are based implicitly or explicitly on two assumptions: (A) there are no systematic cross-sectional or time-series differences in the probability of a trade occurring at the bid or at the ask, and (B) there are no systematic time-series movements in proportional bid-ask spreads.;In this thesis, I test the validity of these two Assumptions by testing four subsets of Assumption A, using LOGIT regressions and a single subset of Assumption B, using a SUR regression. The Canadian data include time and date stamped intraday bid-ask quotes, transaction prices, and volumes on every security listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE) over the period January 1979 to December 1987. The U. S. data consists of all securities <b>interlisted</b> on the TSE, NYSE and AMEX during the period January 1984 to December 1987, and includes many active securities such as IBM, GM, Mobil Oil, and American Express.;I find systematic differences in the probability of a bid and ask across days of the week, price stratified portfolios, and times of day.

Other studies have shown that certain types of investors may be able to earn excess returns by investing in securities following block trades.;This thesis used detailed trade to trade data to study the efficiency of the Toronto Stock Exchange (TSE), the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), and the American Stock Exchange (AMEX), with respect to block trades. Comparing the TSE with the U. S. exchanges, this thesis found no difference in the operational efficiency of these exchanges with respect to block trades. As well, this thesis was unable to reject the null hypothesis that all three exchanges were allocatively efficient with respect to block trades.;In studying the price effects of block trades, this thesis identified a number of biases that were present in the methodologies used in previous block trading studies. After correcting for these biases {{it was found that the}} temporary price effect of a block trade was less than the expected temporary price effect of a non-block trade for the same security. This thesis did find evidence of a permanent price effect following both block sales and purchases on all exchanges; however, the absolute value of this effect was much smaller than was found in earlier studies.;This thesis also conducted an across-market comparison of block trading price effects for securities listed on the TSE and one of the U. S. exchanges. This comparison found a slightly smaller temporary price effect, suggesting higher liquidity, on the U. S. exchanges; however, it also found a slightly larger permanent price effect for securities listed on the U. S. exchanges. These price effect differences were so small that investors have little incentive to conduct block trades for <b>interlisted</b> securities exclusively on the TSE or on a U. S. exchange.;The results of this thesis illustrate that the use of transactions data, rather than quotation data, in event studies can cause a significant overestimation of price effects and of returns based on short-term trading strategies...|$|R
