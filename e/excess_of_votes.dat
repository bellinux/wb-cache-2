40|$|W e {{show that}} the {{butterfly}} ballot used in Palm Beach County, Florida, in the 2000 presidentialelection caused more than 2, 000 Democratic voters to vote by mistake for Reform candidate PatBuchanan, a number larger than George W. Bush’s certified margin of victory in Florida. We use multiple methods and several kinds of data to rule out alternative explanations for the votes Buchanan received in Palm Beach County. Among 3, 053 U. S. counties where Buchanan was on the ballot, Palm Beach County has the most anomalous <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> <b>votes</b> for him. In Palm Beach County, Buchanan’s proportion of the vote on election-day ballots is four times larger than his proportion on absentee (nonbutterfly) ballots, but Buchanan’s proportion does not differ significantly between election-day and absentee ballots in any other Florida county. Unlike other Reform candidates in Palm Beach County, Buchanan tended to receive election-day votes in Democratic precincts and from individuals {{who voted for the}} Democratic U. S. Senate candidate. Robust estimation of overdispersed binomial regression models underpins much of the analysis. Beginning on election day November 7, 2000,Palm Beach County (PBC), Florida, attractednational and eventually international attention because thousands of voters in the county complained that they had difficulty understanding the now infa-mous butterfly ballot. As a result, they claimed that they had cast invalid or erroneous presidential votes...|$|E

He set about making himself stand out amongst the new intake of Conservative MPs. He ruthlessly backed Edward Heath for {{the leadership of the}} Conservative Party following the resignation of Sir Alec Douglas-Home simply because Heath was most likely to lead the party. His tactics paid off; Heath was elected leader and Charles was rewarded by being elevated to the front bench. His early posts included a stint in the Shadow Chief Whip's Office and the Shadow Local Government and Housing Department.|$|R

Whether he has what it takes to rise to the top job however, is less certain".|$|R

It had only received 70,853 as the Ecology Party in the previous election. However, because of First Past the Post system, the Green Party did not gain a single MEP, while the Scottish National Party received 1 seat with only 3% <b>of</b> the <b>vote</b> share. The Green Party's <b>vote</b> total <b>of</b> 2,299,287 remains its best performance in a national election, as does its percentage result of 14.5%.

50|$|In the 1992 UK General Election, the Conservative Party {{were widely}} {{expected}} to be defeated by Neil Kinnock's Labour Party. Tory leader John Major took his campaign into the streets, delivering many addresses from an upturned soapbox. This approach stood {{in contrast to the}} Labour Party's seemingly slicker campaign and it chimed with the electorate, along with hard-hitting negative campaign advertising focusing on the issue of Labour's approach to taxation. Major won in <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> 14 million <b>votes,</b> the highest popular vote for a political party in a British general election.|$|R
50|$|Despite these predictions, the Conservatives won the election, gaining in <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> 14 million <b>votes,</b> {{the highest}} popular vote ever {{recorded}} by a British political {{party in a}} general election to date. Although this translated into a much-reduced majority of 21 seats in the House of Commons (down from a majority of 102 seats at the previous election), this was enough for Major to return as Prime Minister elected in his own right and give the Conservatives their fourth consecutive victory, although the relatively small majority would go on to cause problems for Major throughout his second term.|$|R
50|$|McKinley {{received}} {{a little more}} than seven million votes, Bryan a little less than six and a half million, about 800,000 in <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> the Democratic <b>vote</b> in 1892. It was larger than the Democratic Party was to poll in 1900, 1904, or 1912. It was somewhat less, however, than the combined vote for the Democratic and Populist nominees had been in 1892. In contrast, McKinley received nearly 2,000,000 more votes than had been cast for Benjamin Harrison, the Republican nominee, in 1892. The Republican vote was to be but slightly increased during the next decade.|$|R

The youngest player on the team, he recorded a goal and an assist over six games as Canada finished in sixth place. Playing in the tournament a second consecutive year in 1993, Kariya improved to two goals and eight points over seven games, ranking second in team scoring behind Martin Lapointe. Helping Canada to a record of six winsand one loss, they tied Sweden for first overall in the standings, but {{won the gold medal}} by way of their 5–4 win against them in their second game. The championship marked Kariya's first international gold medal and began a streak of five consecutive gold medals for Canada at the tournament. He was named to the Tournament All-Star Team, alongside Canadian goaltender Manny Legace and defenceman Brent Tully. Nearly ten years later, TSN held a fan-voted poll on the Internet to select Canada's all-time World Junior team. The poll garnered in <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> 350,000 <b>votes</b> with Kariya chosen as one of 13 forwards on the team.|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{compromise}} in the Constitution, Southern states could count three-fifths of their slave populations toward the state populations {{for purposes of}} Congressional apportionment and the electoral college. This resulted in those states having political power in <b>excess</b> <b>of</b> the white <b>voting</b> population. The South dominated the national government and the presidency for years. Congress adopted legislation that favored slaveholders, such as permitting slavery in territories as the nation began to expand to the West. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 was strengthened by the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, part of the Compromise of 1850, requiring even the governments and residents of free states to enforce the capture and return of fugitive slaves. Famous fugitives such as Frederick Douglass and Sojourner Truth gained support of white abolitionists to purchase their freedom, to avoid being captured {{and returned to the}} South and slavery. In 1857, the ruling of Dred Scott v. Sandford effectively denied citizenship to black people of all statuses.|$|R

40|$|The Italian Communist Party (PCI) {{emerged from}} {{the chaos of the}} Italian defeat in 1943 as a {{powerful}} and cohesive movement. Based upon organizational development throughout the years of Fascist rule in Italy, plus a combination of vigorous partisan activities and a willingness to compromise politically in exchange for governmental participation, the PCI showed promise for achieving economic and social change in Italy. Conservative countermeasures and Allied pressures, however, diminished the Communist advantage until, by 1947, the Party was no longer represented in the postwar government. The success apparent in the economic arena due to the Christian Democrat 2 ̆ 7 s program initiated in their monocolore government of 1947 and an East-West demarcation internationally, with the Soviets gaining control in Eastern Europe, created for the general elections of April, 1948 an atmosphere ripe for Christian Democrat exploitation.
