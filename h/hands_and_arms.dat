5|$|There is a {{large body}} of {{evidence}} showing that dromaeosaurids were covered in feathers. Some dromaeosaurid fossils preserve long, pennaceous feathers on the <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> (remiges) and tail (rectrices), as well as shorter, down-like feathers covering the body. Other fossils, which do not preserve actual impressions of feathers, still preserve the associated bumps on the forearm bones where long wing feathers would have attached in life. Overall, this feather pattern looks very much like Archaeopteryx.|$|E

25|$|A pillow or sex pillow (especially a firm one) can be used, {{to alter}} the depth and angle of penetration.

Each of these methods can increase the depth of penetration. Raising the clitoris generally allows easier access to it in this position. Using a pillow can also help the woman arch her back and avoid backache.|$|E
25|$|Six {{forensic}} experts {{hired by}} Mrs. Duggan examined Shove's autopsy report and photographs taken by accident investigators in Wiesbaden. A forensic pathologist suggested that bruises on Duggan's <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> were defensive injuries. Paul Canning, a forensic photographer formerly with the Metropolitan police, and Alan Bayle, a forensic scientist, suggested that Duggan may have died elsewhere and been {{placed at the}} scene. Bayle argued that the Peugeot windscreen had been hit with a crowbar or similar, while Canning wrote that he found nothing {{to suggest that the}} cars had made contact with Duggan.

40|$|There {{has been}} {{discussion}} in international literature {{as to whether}} vibration containing impact and high frequencies, i. e. above 1000 Hz could make a special contribution to injuries in the <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>arm.</b> The aim of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} effect of impact and high frequency vibration on the absorption and transmission of energy to the <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>arm</b> system. The results show that the transmission of acceleration magnitude or energy to different parts of the <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>arm</b> decreases with the distance from the source and are highly dependent in the vibration frequency. There are also differences in the energy transmission due to different types of exposure, random or sinusoidal vibrations. Furthermore, the results show that a great amount of energy was absorbed in the human <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>arm</b> within the freequency range 20 to 5000 Hz. Moreover, was found that there were also differences in energy absorption due to gender; females absorbed less energy than males. Vibration containing impact had a significant influence on both the energy absorption <b>and</b> the <b>hand</b> forces compared to vibration without impact. There were differences in the amount of absorbed energy in the <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>arm</b> between the four investigated vibrating tools. The vibration level also has a strong effect on the quantity of absorbed energy in present studies. If the assumption that higher amount of absorbed energy in the <b>hand</b> <b>and</b> <b>arm</b> represent <b>and</b> increased risk for injury, it can be concluded from the results in this thesis that high frequency vibration and impacts increase the risk for injury.

25|$|Macewen {{was born}} near Port Bannatyne, Isle of Bute, Scotland in 1848 and {{studied at the}} University of Glasgow, {{receiving}} a medical degree in 1872. He was greatly influenced by Joseph, Lord Lister (1827–1912), who revolutionised surgery by developing antisepsis, {{by the use of}} phenol, thus decreasing drastically the enormous mortality of surgical patients due to infections. By following Lister and adopting systematically the use of scrubbing (deep cleansing and disinfection of <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms),</b> sterilisation of surgical tools, use of surgical gowns, and (recently discovered) anaesthesia, Macewen {{became one of the most}} innovative surgeons of his time and was able to greatly advance modern surgical technique and improve the recovery of patients.|$|E
25|$|In May 1969 he was {{commanding}} the 212th Company of the 1st Mobile Strike Force Battalion {{when it was}} attacked by a strong North Vietnamese force near Ben Het Camp. His company was isolated and, surrounded on three sides, Payne's Vietnamese troops began to fall back. Payne, by now wounded in the <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> and under heavy fire, covered the withdrawal before organising his troops into a defensive perimeter. He then spent three hours scouring {{the scene of the}} day's fight for isolated and wounded soldiers, all the while evading the enemy who kept up regular fire. He found some forty wounded men, brought some in himself and organised the rescue of the others, leading the party back to base through enemy dominated terrain.|$|E
25|$|Essential tremor (ET), {{also known}} as benign {{essential}} tremor, or familial tremor, {{is the most common}} movement disorder. It is estimated that 5 percent of people worldwide suffer from this condition, affecting those of all ages but typically staying within families. ET typically affects the <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> but can also affect the head, voice, chin, trunk and legs. Both sides of the body tend to be equally affected. The tremor is called an action tremor, becoming noticeable in the arms when they are being used. Patients often report that alcohol helps lessen the symptoms. Primary medical treatments for ET are usually beta-blockers. For patients who fail to respond sufficiently to medication, deep brain stimulation and thalamotomy can be highly effective.|$|E

25|$|In {{his youth}} he often played with Ken Rosewall {{and they became}} known as the Sydney 'twins', {{although}} they had very different physiques, personalities and playing styles. Their first match was in their early teens and was played as an opener of an exhibition match between Australia and America. Rosewall won 6–0, 6–0. Hoad built up great physical strength, especially in his <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms,</b> by training at a police boys' club, where he made a name as a boxer. Hoad was about 12 when he was introduced to Adrian Quist, a former Australian tennis champion and then general manager of the Dunlop sports goods company. Quist played a couple of sets with Hoad and was impressed by his natural ability. When Hoad was 14 he left school and joined the Dunlop payroll, following the pattern of that 'shamateur' era when most of Australia's brightest tennis prospects were employed by sporting goods companies.|$|E

[...] The video also includes shots of an albino ball python and a tarantula. Cory Lamz of Westword wrote a positive review of the video: [...] "Watching 'In the Dark' is like dancing under a strobe light on ecstasy. In a sea of hands, literally, Dev manages to tease you, seduce you and entice you. She makes you want to touch her, just like every other hand in the video." [...] Contessa Gayles of AOL Music referred the video to as [...] "freaky" [...] and [...] "funky", writing [...] "Forget 'dancing in the dark,' Dev works it in a sea of dismembered, black-painted <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> in this freaky, funky new vid."

A handguard was added above the barrel to prevent burns, and the formerly fixed barrel changing handle was swapped for a folding unit. Certain parts were beveled or chamfered to prevent cutting soldiers' <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms.</b> Other changes involved the bipod, pistol grip, flash suppressor, and sights. Over the years, additional modifications have been introduced as part of the Soldier Enhancement Program and Rapid Fielding Initiative.

500|$|The rioters removed Blakelock's {{protective}} helmet, {{which was}} never found. Rose {{writes that the}} pathologist, David Bowen, found 54 holes in Blakelock's overalls, and 40 cutting or stabbing injuries, eight of them to his head, caused by a machete, sword or axe-type instrument. A six-inch-long knife was buried in his neck up to the hilt. His body was covered in marks from having been kicked or stamped on. His <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> were badly cut, and he had lost several fingers trying to defend himself. There were 14 stab wounds on his back, one {{on the back of}} his right thigh, six on his face, and his jawbone had been smashed by a blow that left a six-inch gash across the right side of his head. Bowen said the force of this blow had been [...] "almost as if to sever his head," [...] which gave rise to a rumour that an attempt had been made to decapitate him (according to Rose, the autopsy photographs did not support this).|$|E
500|$|After {{hearing all}} the {{evidence}}, Justice Spicer ruled on November 30 that Virgil, as the lawman in charge that day, had acted within {{his office and}} that there was not enough evidence to indict the men. He described Frank McLaury's insistence that he would not give up his weapons unless the marshal and his deputies also gave up their arms as a [...] "proposition both monstrous and startling!" [...] He noted that the prosecution claimed that the Cowboys' purpose was to leave town, yet Ike Clanton and Billy Claiborne did not have their weapons with them. Spicer noted that the doctor who examined the dead Cowboys established that the wounds they received could not have occurred if their <b>hands</b> <b>and</b> <b>arms</b> had been in the positions that prosecution witnesses described. Spicer did not condone all of the Earps' actions and criticized Virgil Earp's use of Wyatt and Holliday as deputies, but he concluded that no laws were broken. He said the evidence indicated that the Earps and Holliday acted within the law and that Holliday and Wyatt had been properly deputized by Virgil Earp.|$|E
