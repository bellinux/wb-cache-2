5|$|Lice {{recorded}} from impala include Damalinia aepycerus, D. elongata, Linognathus aepycerus and L. nevilli; in a study, <b>ivermectin</b> (a medication against parasites) {{was found}} to have an effect on Boophilus decoloratus and Linognathus species, though not on Damalinia species. In a study of impala in South Africa, the number of worms in juveniles showed an increase with age, reaching a peak when impala turned a year old. This study recorded worms of genera such as Cooperia, Cooperoides, Fasciola, Gongylonema. Haemonchus, Impalaia, Longistrongylus and Trichostrongylus; some of these showed seasonal variations in density.|$|E
5|$|Fleas and ticks {{are common}} causes of {{physical}} irritation. In {{a study in}} Egypt, a species of Hyalomma was dominant in dromedaries, comprising 95.6% of the adult ticks isolated from the camels. In Israel, the number of ticks per camel ranged from 20 to 105. Nine camels in the date palm plantations in Arava Valley were injected with <b>ivermectin,</b> which is not effective against Hyalomma tick infestations. Larvae of the camel nasal fly Cephalopsis titillator can cause possibly fatal brain compression and nervous disorders. Illnesses that can affect dromedary productivity are pyogenic diseases and wound infections caused by Corynebacterium and Streptococcus, pulmonary disorders caused by Pasteurella such as hemorrhagic septicemia and Rickettsia species, camelpox, anthrax, and cutaneous necrosis caused by Streptothrix and deficiency of salt in the diet.|$|E
25|$|Chemical agents used {{to control}} ticks and mites include dusting sulfur and <b>ivermectin.</b>|$|E
25|$|The only agents {{approved}} by the FDA for treatment of pediculosis are topical <b>ivermectin</b> lotion, lindane, and malathion.|$|E
25|$|Medications {{with good}} {{evidence}} include <b>ivermectin</b> and azelaic acid creams and brimonidine, doxycycline, and isotretinoin by mouth. Lesser evidence supports metronidazole cream and tetracycline by mouth.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ivermectin</b> is {{the normal}} {{treatment}} for riding rabbits and small mammals of Haemaphysalis leporispalustris. Insecticides such as pyrethrin, permethrin, and amitraz are dangerous to small mammals {{and must be}} avoided.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ivermectin,</b> {{even with}} lapses {{up to four}} months between doses, still {{provides}} 95% protection from adult worms. This period is called the reach-back effect. Annual heartworm testing is highly recommended for pet owners who choose to use minimal dosing schedules.|$|E
25|$|Topical <b>ivermectin</b> {{preparations}} {{have been}} shown to be effective for scabies in adults, though only one such formulation is available in the United States at present, and it is not FDA-approved as a scabies treatment. It has also been useful for sarcoptic mange (the veterinary analog of human scabies).|$|E
25|$|The {{concept of}} an {{allosteric}} pharmacology for ion channels was developed over the years. In addition to the well known GABAA receptor positive allosteric modulators (such as benzodiazepines and barbiturate drugs), one can find antiparasitic drug such as <b>ivermectin</b> and glutamate receptor modulators used against Alzheimer's disease such as aniracetam.|$|E
25|$|Antigen testing, in most practices, has supplanted or {{supplemented}} microfilarial detection. Combining the microfilaria {{and adult}} antigen test is most useful in dogs receiving diethylcarbamazine or no preventative (as macrolides as for example <b>ivermectin</b> or moxidectin typically render the dog amicrofilaremic). Up to 1% of infected dogs are microfilaria-positive and antigen-negative.|$|E
25|$|Oral <b>ivermectin</b> is {{effective}} in eradicating scabies, often in a single dose. It is the treatment of choice for crusted scabies, and is sometimes prescribed in combination with a topical agent. It has not been tested on infants, and is not recommended for children under six years of age.|$|E
25|$|While not curable, {{treatment}} usually improves symptoms. Treatment {{is typically}} with metronidazole, doxycycline, or tetracycline. When {{the eyes are}} affected azithromycin eye drops may help. Other treatments with tentative benefit include brimonidine cream, <b>ivermectin</b> cream, and isotretinoin. Dermabrasion or laser surgery may also be used. The use of sunscreen is typically recommended.|$|E
25|$|Moxidectin {{is being}} {{evaluated}} {{as a treatment}} for scabies. It is established in veterinary medicine to treat a range of parasites, including sarcoptic mange. Its advantage over <b>ivermectin</b> is its longer half life in humans and, thus, potential duration of action. Tea tree oil appears to be effective in a Petri dish.|$|E
25|$|They {{are very}} prone to Demodex Mange due to culling for performance. There are two {{different}} types of Demodex Mange, namely Localized and Generalized Demodex. Although it is not contagious it is sometimes difficult to treat due to immunodeficiency in some puppies. The Localized symptoms are usually loss of hair in small patches on the head and feet of the puppies. This type will usually heal as the puppies grow and their immune systems grow stronger. The second type which is Generalized Demodex mange is a more severe form of the sickness. The symptoms are more severe and include loss of hair throughout the entire body and the skin may also be scabby and bloody. Generalized are usually hereditary due to immunodeficiency genes that are passed on from Sire and Dam to their puppies. A simple skin scraping test will allow the vet to diagnose demodex mange. The most widely used method to treat Demodex Mange is <b>ivermectin</b> injections or oral medications. Since Demodex Mange lives in the hair follicles of the dog, <b>Ivermectin</b> will kill these mites at the source.|$|E
25|$|In 2003 DNA testing {{carried out}} on 56 {{individual}} Koolie bloodlines from Australia by Dr. Mark Neff of the University of California at Davis in the USA cleared those bloodlines tested {{for the presence of}} the mutant gene mdr1-1, which causes malfunction in the canine multidrug resistance gene; Collie bloodlines were chosen to be tested because they showed a reaction, even death, to chemicals, such as <b>Ivermectin,</b> used in the treatment of intestinal parasites.|$|E
25|$|Broad-spectrum benzimidazoles (such as {{albendazole}} and mebendazole) are {{the first}} line treatment of intestinal roundworm and tapeworm infections. Macrocyclic lactones (such as <b>ivermectin)</b> are effective against adult and migrating larval stages of nematodes. Praziquantel is the drug of choice for schistosomiasis, taeniasis, and most types of food-borne trematodiases. Oxamniquine is also widely used in mass deworming programmes. Pyrantel is commonly used for veterinary nematodiasis. Artemisinins and derivatives are proving to be candidates as drugs of choice for trematodiasis.|$|E
25|$|Avermectins {{belong to}} the family of macrocyclic lactones and are the major drugs used as in-feed {{treatments}} to kill sea lice. The first avermectin used was <b>ivermectin</b> at doses close to the therapeutic level and was not submitted for legal approval for use on fish by its manufacturer. <b>Ivermectin</b> was toxic to some fish, causing sedation and central nervous system depression due to the drug’s ability to cross the blood–brain barrier. Emamectin benzoate, which is the active agent in the formulation SLICE, has been used since 1999 and has a greater safety margin on fish. It is administered at 50µg/kg/day for 7 days and is effective for two months, killing both chalimus and mobile stages. Withdrawal times vary with jurisdiction from 68 days in Canada to 175 degree days in Norway. Avermectins act by opening glutamate-gated chloride channels in arthropod neuromuscular tissues, causing hyperpolarization and flaccid paralysis leading to death. Resistance has been noted in Chalimus rogercresseyi in Chile and L. salmonis on North Atlantic fish farms. The resistance is likely due to prolonged use of the drug leading to up-regulation of P-glycoprotein, similar to what has been seen in nematode resistance to macrocyclic lactones.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases of}} coinfection, {{combination}} therapy with <b>ivermectin</b> and diethylcarbamazine is advocated. However coinfection with malaria and HIV, especially among African women, {{does not respond}} well to the current combination therapies. It is more pressing for trichuriasis that the recommended drugs fail to provide positive results. A novel drug tribendimidine, which was approved in China by the CCDC for human use in 2004, {{has been subjected to}} clinical trials showing that they are highly effective against major human flukes, ascaris (>90% cure rate) and hookworm (>82%); however with low cure rate for whipworm (<37%).|$|E
25|$|According to the College of Veterinary Medicine at Washington State University, the Shetland Sheepdog, {{and many}} other herding breeds, have a risk of being born with a MDR1 Gene Mutation, with about 15% of {{individuals}} affected. Cross-breeds are also affected. Dogs carrying Mdr1-1 share a common ancestor that experienced remarkable evolutionary success, having contributed genetically to at least nine distinct breeds of dog. Due to this genetic mutation, affected dogs may exhibit sensitivity or adverse reactions to many drugs, including Acepromazine, Butorphanol, Doxorubicin, Erythromycin, <b>Ivermectin,</b> Loperamide, Milbemycin, Moxidectin, Rifampin, Selamectin, Vinblastine, and Vincristine.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{are available to}} treat those infected, including permethrin, crotamiton, and lindane creams and <b>ivermectin</b> pills. Sexual contacts within the last month and {{people who live in}} the same house should also be treated at the same time. Bedding and clothing used in the last three days should be washed in hot water and dried in a hot dryer. As the mite does not live for more than three days away from human skin, more washing is not needed. Symptoms may continue for two to four weeks following treatment. If after this time symptoms continue, retreatment may be needed.|$|E
25|$|Mass-treatment {{programs}} that use topical permethrin or oral <b>ivermectin</b> {{have been effective}} in reducing the prevalence of scabies {{in a number of}} populations. No vaccine is available for scabies. The simultaneous treatment of all close contacts is recommended, even if they show no symptoms of infection (asymptomatic), to reduce rates of recurrence. Since mites can survive for only two to three days without a host, other objects in the environment pose little risk of transmission except in the case of crusted scabies, thus cleaning is of little importance. Rooms used by those with crusted scabies require thorough cleaning.|$|E
25|$|A 1999 {{in vitro}} study from Pakistan found 40% of {{isolates}} {{are resistant to}} common antiprotozoal drugs. A study of isolates from patients diagnosed with IBS found 40% of isolates resistant to metronidazole and 32% resistant to furazolidone. Drugs reported in studies {{to be effective in}} eradicating Blastocystis infection have included metronidazole, trimethoprim, TMP-SMX (only trimethoprim is active with sulphamethoxazole demonstrating no activity), tetracycline, doxycycline, nitazoxanide, pentamidine, paromomycin and iodoquinol. Iodoquinol {{has been found to be}} less effective in practice than in-vitro. Miconazole and quinacrine have been reported as effective agents against Blastocystis growth in-vitro. Rifaximin, and albendazole have shown promise as has <b>ivermectin</b> which demonstrated high effectiveness against blastocystis hominis isolates in an in vitro study. There is also evidence that the probiotic yeast Saccharomyces boulardii, and the plant mallotus oppositifolius may be effective against Blastocystis infections.|$|E
2500|$|Drugs used in {{treatment}} of A. caninum infections of dogs include: dichlorvos, fenbendazole, flubendazole, mebendazole, nitroscanate, piperazine, pyrantel, milbemycin, moxidectin, diethylcarbamazine, oxibendazole, [...] and <b>ivermectin.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Heartworm {{prevention}} for cats {{is available}} as <b>ivermectin</b> (Heartgard for Cats), [...] milbemycin (Interceptor), or the topical selamectin (Revolution for Cats) and Advantage Multi (imidacloprid + moxidectin) topical solution.|$|E
2500|$|Treatment {{typically}} {{consists of}} putting the cat on a monthly heartworm preventive and a short-term corticosteroid. [...] Surgery has also been used successfully to remove adult worms. [...] <b>Ivermectin,</b> milbemycin, and selamectin are approved for use in cats in the US. [...] The prognosis for feline heartworm disease is guarded.|$|E
2500|$|Infections with Trypanosoma {{species are}} treated, either prophylactically or to treat acute cases with {{synthetic}} chemical {{drugs such as}} diminazine. Infections with nematode worms causing filariosis may be treated with the avermectin class of biologically derived drugs (macrocyclic lactones) such as <b>ivermectin,</b> doramectin, moxidectin. There are commercially available vaccines to protect animals against bluetongue, and African horse sickness ...|$|E
2500|$|Some Australian Shepherds (as well as Collies, German Shepherds, {{and many}} other herding dogs) are {{susceptible}} to a genetic mutation of the MDR1 gene. Dogs with the mutation can suffer toxicity from antiparasitics such as <b>ivermectin</b> in high doses, and other drugs. [...] A test is available {{to determine if a}} particular dog carries the mutated gene.|$|E
2500|$|Another way of combating drug {{resistance}} in adult horses is to deworm less frequently, by performing fecal egg counts on manure and deworming only horses {{with a high}} count. This strategy is now recommended by most veterinarians and parasitologists, as it reduces the probability of resistance. For horses that are consistently deemed [...] "low shedders," [...] it is still recommended to deworm at least 1-2 times per year with <b>ivermectin</b> + praziquantel or moxidectin + praziquantel to target tapeworms, bots, and small strongyles. This is typically done {{in the fall and}} spring.|$|E
2500|$|Drug {{resistance}} {{is a growing}} concern for many horse owners. Resistance has been noted with <b>ivermectin</b> to ascarids, and with fenbendazole, oxibendazole, and pyrantel to small strongyles. [...] Development of new drugs takes many years, leading to the concern that worms could out-evolve the drugs currently available to treat them. As a result, most veterinarians now recommend deworming for small strongyles based on fecal egg counts to minimize the development of resistant parasite populations. Fecal egg count reduction tests can also be performed to identify which dewormers are effective on a particular farm.|$|E
2500|$|A clean {{environment}} minimises {{the risk of}} A. caninum infection; this can include regularly washed concrete or gravel in kennels instead of soil. [...] Bitches are typically checked prior to using them for breeding purposes for nematodes such as A. caninum and birth and suckling can be restricted to sanitised areas to {{lower the risk of}} health complications to the pups. [...] When infection of a pregnant bitch is known or suspected fenbendazole or <b>ivermectin</b> can be administered to the bitch to help avoid transmission to the pups.|$|E
2500|$|Long-term monthly {{administration}} of <b>ivermectin</b> year-round at {{three times the}} dose normally used for heartworm [...] prevention eventually kills adult heartworms. However, {{this is not the}} treatment of choice for removal of adult heartworms for two reasons. First, this treatment is not as effective as melarsomine. More importantly, adult heartworms do not begin to die until 18 months of treatment have elapsed, which is not acceptable for dogs with high-volume infections. [...] Long-term treatment over a year with [...] doxycycline daily and Heartgard Plus {{has been shown to be}} effective in early heartworm patients which are asymptomatic.|$|E
2500|$|Permethrin is {{the most}} {{effective}} treatment for scabies, and remains the treatment of choice. It is applied from the neck down, usually before bedtime, and left on for about eight to 14 hours, then washed off in the morning. Care should be taken to coat the entire skin surface, not just symptomatic areas; any patch of skin left untreated can provide a [...] "safe haven" [...] for one or more mites to survive. One application is normally sufficient, as permethrin kills eggs and hatchlings, as well as adult mites, though many physicians recommend a second application three to seven days later as a precaution. [...] Crusted scabies may require multiple applications, or supplemental treatment with oral <b>ivermectin</b> (below). Permethrin may cause slight irritation of the skin that is usually tolerable.|$|E
2500|$|Prevention of {{heartworm}} infection can {{be obtained}} {{through a number of}} veterinary drugs. The drugs approved for use in the US are <b>ivermectin</b> (sold under the brand names Heartgard, Iverhart, and several other generic versions), milbemycin (Interceptor Flavor Tabs and Sentinel Flavor Tabs) and moxidectin (ProHeart) administered as pills or chewable tablets. Moxidectin is also available in both a six-month and 12-month, sustained-release injection, ProHeart 6 or ProHeart 12, administered by veterinarians. [...] The injectable form of moxidectin was taken off the market in the United States due to safety concerns in 2004, but the FDA returned a newly formulated ProHeart 6 to the market in 2008. ProHeart 6 remains on the market in many other countries, including Canada and Japan. Its sister product, ProHeart 12, is used extensively in Australia and Asia as a 12-month injectable preventive. [...] Topical treatments are available, as well. [...] Advantage Multi (imidacloprid + moxidectin) Topical Solution, uses moxidectin for control and prevention of roundworms, hookworms, heartworms, and whipworms, as well as imidacloprid to kill adult fleas. [...] Selamectin (Revolution) is a topical preventive likewise administered monthly; it also controls fleas, ticks, and mites.|$|E
50|$|Surgical removal or {{treatment}} with albendazole or <b>ivermectin</b> is recommended. The most prescribed treatment for gnathostomiasis is surgical {{removal of the}} larvae but this is only effective when the worms are located in an accessible location. In addition to surgical excision, albendazole and <b>ivermectin</b> have been noted {{in their ability to}} eliminate the parasite. Albendazole is recommended to be administered at 400 mg daily for 21 days as an adjunct to surgical excision, while <b>ivermectin</b> is better tolerated as a single dose. <b>Ivermectin</b> can also serve as a replacement for those that can’t handle albendazole 200 ug/kg p.o. as a single dose. However, <b>ivermectin</b> {{has been shown to be}} less effective then albendazole.|$|E
5000|$|It can {{be treated}} with <b>ivermectin.</b> [...] It can be {{prevented}} by insecticide spraying or preventative dosing with <b>ivermectin.</b> [...] The symptoms are generally itching and skin lesions.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ivermectin</b> (which can {{be given}} orally) {{has been shown to}} reduce levels of louse infestation. [...] Originally {{approved}} for onchocerciasis and strongyloidiasis, <b>Ivermectin</b> is now approved by the FDA for pediculosis.|$|E
