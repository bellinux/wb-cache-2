25|$|Given {{the above}} it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> {{that within a}} few years the academy’s {{excellent}} reputation had spread so quickly that by 1814 Mordecai was forced to cap enrollment at 110 students.|$|E
25|$|Budan's theorem {{forms the}} basis for Vincent's theorem and Vincent's (exponential) method for the {{isolation}} of the real roots of polynomials. Therefore, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that Vincent in both of his papers of 1834 and 1836 states Budan's theorem and contrasts it with the one by Fourier. Vincent was the last author in the 19th century to state Budan's theorem in its original form.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} such {{references}} that indicate that music {{was an integral}} part of the Greek perception of how their race had even come into existence and how their destinies continued to be watched over and controlled by the Gods. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder,</b> then, that music was omnipresent at the Pythian Games, the Olympic Games, religious ceremonies, leisure activities, and even the beginnings of drama as an outgrowth of the dithyrambs performed in honor of Dionysus.|$|E

25|$|Later {{development}} of the Stelo stagnated. The Universal League founders wanted to show their good will by maintaining a constant value for the Stelo, but their efforts were doomed to failure. The Dutch price of bread gradually increased, but nobody thought to adjust {{the relationship between the}} Stelo and the guilder. The ratio remained four Steloj to the guilder, and bank currency conversion tables were used to fix the value of the Stelo in other countries. Moreover, even the Universal League gave up the idea of recording bookkeeping transactions in Stelo monetary units, so nobody gained experience with a coin of constant value. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that the Stelo lost its reputation and that its use even by Esperantists became rare.|$|E
25|$|The Western U.S. is {{the largest}} region of the country, {{covering}} {{more than half the}} land area of the United States. It is also the most geographically diverse, incorporating geographic regions such as the temperate rainforests of the Northwest, the highest mountain ranges (including the Rocky Mountains, and the Sierra Nevada, the Great Plains, and all of the desert areas located in the United States (the Mojave, Sonoran, Great Basin, and Chihuahua deserts). Given this expansive and diverse geography it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> the region is difficult to specifically define. Sensing a possible shift in the popular understanding of the West as a region in the early 1990s, historian Walter Nugent conducted a survey of three groups of professionals with ties to the region: a large group of Western historians (187 respondents), and two smaller groups, 25 journalists and publishers and 39 Western authors. A majority of the historian respondents placed the eastern boundary of the West east of the Census definition out on {{the eastern edge of the}} Great Plains or on the Mississippi River. The survey respondents as a whole showed just how little agreement there was on the boundaries of the West.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} the sad state of public transit is a very basic one - the transit systems just do not offer a service which will attract people away from their automobiles. Consequently, their {{patronage}} comes very largely from those who cannot drive, either because they are too young, too old, or because they are too poor to own and operate an automobile. Look {{at it from the}} standpoint of a commuter who lives in a suburb and is trying to get to work in the central business district (CBD). If he is going to go by transit, a typical scenario might be the following: he must first walk to the closest bus stop, let us say a five or ten minute walk, and then he may have to wait up to another ten minutes, possibly in inclement weather, for the bus to arrive. When it arrives, he may have to stand unless he is lucky enough to find a seat. The bus will be caught up in street congestion and move slowly, and it will make many stops completely unrelated to his trip objective. The bus may then let him off at a terminal to a suburban train. Again he must wait, and, after boarding the train, again experience a number of stops {{on the way to the}} CBD, and possibly again he may have to stand in the aisle. He will get off at the station most convenient to his destination and possibly have to transfer again onto a distribution system. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that in those cities where ample inexpensive parking is available, most of those who can drive do drive.|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{began reading}} Shakespeare's plays and poetry {{when he was}} a young boy. He would involve himself so closely with the plays that he was once terrified by the Ghost in Hamlet and had to [...] "have people about him". Johnson's fascination with Shakespeare {{continued}} throughout his life, and Johnson focused his time on Shakespeare's plays while preparing A Dictionary of the English Language, so it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that Shakespeare is the most quoted author in it.|$|E
500|$|Smart {{was left}} alone, {{except for his}} cat Jeoffrey and the {{occasional}} gawker. It is very possible that he felt [...] "homeless" [...] during this time and surely {{felt that he was}} in a [...] "limbo... between public and private space". In London, only a few of his works were still being published. However, not everyone viewed Smart's [...] "madness" [...] as problematic, and Johnson defended him, sometimes seriously and sometimes comically, many times. A century later, Robert Browning later remarked that A Song to David was great because Smart was mad, and that the poem allowed him to rank alongside of Milton and Keats. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that a few of his loyal friends did come to Mr. Potter's and freed him.|$|E
500|$|In {{front of}} a large crowd, Small Heath {{suffered}} what was described as an [...] "unfortunate" [...] one-goal defeat at Grimsby Town. Hollis should have done better with Grimsby's opener, Frank Mobley was injured around the eye in collision with the goalkeeper when scoring Small Heath's only goal and showed some bravery in remaining on the field, and Wheldon had an apparently valid goal disallowed. Short, in a [...] "trifle risky" [...] style, and the solid Devey again did well in defence. Lost gate receipts because of Aston Villa's withdrawal from the United Counties League was decidedly unpopular with the other members, and the Small Heath committee arranged a smoking concert to raise funds. Those clubs {{at the bottom of the}} First Division and top of the Second were all recruiting new players: [...] "the test matches mean such a lot to the clubs concerned that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> at this anxiety to secure new blood." [...] Small Heath acquired the services of full-backs Percy Watson and William Purves, from Rotherham Town and Irish club Glentoran respectively.|$|E

500|$|More than {{a century}} after his death, {{literary}} critics such as G. Birkbeck Hill and T. S. Eliot came to regard Johnson as a serious critic. They began to study Johnson's works with an increasing focus on the critical analysis found in his edition of Shakespeare and Lives of the Poets. Yvor Winters claimed that [...] "A great critic is the rarest of all literary geniuses; perhaps the only critic in English who deserves that epithet is Samuel Johnson". F. R. Leavis agreed and, on Johnson's criticism, said, [...] "When we read him we know, beyond question, {{that we have here}} a powerful and distinguished mind operating at first hand upon literature. This, we can say with emphatic conviction, really is criticism". Edmund Wilson claimed that [...] "The Lives of the Poets and the prefaces and commentary on Shakespeare are among the most brilliant and the most acute documents in the whole range of English criticism". The critic Harold Bloom placed Johnson's work firmly within the Western canon, describing him as [...] "unmatched by any critic in any nation before or after him...Bate in the finest insight on Johnson I know, emphasised that no other writer is so obsessed by the realisation that the mind is an activity, one that will turn to destructiveness of the self or of others unless it is directed to labour." [...] It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that his philosophical insistence that the language within literature must be examined became a prevailing mode of literary theory during the mid-20th century.|$|E
2500|$|The {{earliest}} surviving written use of {{the term}} {{can be found in the}} diary of 2nd Lieutenant Jackson B. A. Lowrance, who wrote the following on February 6, 1863 while in Pender County, southeastern North Carolina: [...] "I know now what is meant by the Piney Woods of North Carolina and the idea occurs to me that it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> we are called 'Tar Heels'." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{other is}} the passing of Chinese Chan master Puhua (J., Fuke) and is recounted in the Record of Linji (J., Rinzai). Puhua {{was known for his}} unusual {{behavior}} and teaching style so it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that he is associated with an event that breaks the usual prohibition on displaying such powers. Here is the account from Irmgard Schloegl's [...] "The Zen Teaching of Rinzai".|$|E

2500|$|Pretty Lass {{was one of}} four {{vessels that}} Mr. T. Lockyer, of Plymouth, owned that the {{government}} hired at the same time. In reporting the transaction, the Naval Chronicle described Pretty Lass as a ship under the command of Captain Tippet. Tippet was Commander James Tippett. The Sporting Magazine reported on Tippett's appointment to command Pretty Lass, stating that [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that a Pretty Lass should have a Tippet." ...|$|E
2500|$|The term is {{now widely}} used by {{researchers}} and academicians {{and so is}} no longer merely a slang term, but a name clearly attached to a recognized and well-studied segment of U.S. culture: [...] "Most of the professional research on growing up in military families {{has contributed to the}} perpetuation of the 'brat' label," [...] sociologist and noted expert on the study of military brats Morten Ender wrote. [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that the label endures and is as popular as ever." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the subject}} of peace and war, Mirabeau {{supported}} the king's authority with some success. Again, almost alone in the Assembly, he held that the soldier {{ceased to be a}} citizen when he became a soldier; he must submit to the deprivation of his liberty to think and act and must recognize that a soldier's first duty is obedience. With such sentiments, it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that he approved of the vigorous conduct of the marquis de Bouillé at Nancy, which was to his credit, as Bouillé was opposed to him.|$|E
6000|$|Adeline had full {{satisfaction}} in recounting the governess's mistake to the maids, and in hearing from Esther that it <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder,</b> 'for {{that she looked}} more like a born lady than Lady Florence herself!' ...|$|R

60|$|Fanny Price puzzled Philip. Her conceit was stupendous. Philip {{had already}} {{discovered}} {{that everyone in}} the studio cordially disliked her; and it <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder,</b> for she seemed to go {{out of her way to}} wound people.|$|R
2500|$|The {{constant}} {{comments of}} the Romans about Cleopatra often undermine her, representing the Roman thought {{on the foreign}} and particularly of Egyptians. From {{the perspective of the}} reason-driven Romans, Shakespeare's [...] "Egyptian queen repeatedly violates the rules of decorum". [...] It is because of this distaste that Cleopatra [...] "embodies political power, a power which is continuously underscored, denied, nullified by the Roman counterpart". To many of Antony's crew, his actions appeared extravagant and over the top: [...] "Antony's devotion is inordinate and therefore irrational". It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder,</b> then, that she is such a subordinated queen.|$|E
2500|$|Operation Goodwood almost cost Montgomery his job, as Eisenhower seriously {{considered}} sacking him and only {{chose not to}} do so because to sack the popular [...] "Monty" [...] would have caused such a political backlash in Britain against the Americans at a critical moment in the war that the resulting strains in the Atlantic alliance were not considered worth it. Montgomery expressed his satisfaction at the results of Goodwood when calling the operation off. Eisenhower {{was under the impression that}} Goodwood was to be a break out operation. There was a miscommunication between the two men or Eisenhower did not understand the strategy. Alan Brooke chief of the British Imperial General Staff wrote: [...] "Ike knows nothing about strategy and is quite unsuited to the post of Supreme Commander. It <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that Monty's real high ability is not always realised" [...] Bradley fully understood Montgomery's intentions. Both men would not give away to the press the true intentions of their strategy.|$|E
2500|$|... "Black women's {{relationships}} to their bodies occur within overlapping cultural contexts that offer contradictory messages about their value and function". In a male dominated society, it <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that women {{used to work}} hard to align themselves with male images including how they'd dressed. As women generally gained access to and exposure within the offerings of several sectors of society, for example music, movies and television, we saw more images of what constituted attractiveness emerge. Following this came the perception of freedom to express oneself through several avenues including apparel. Rappers Lil' Kim and Eve are known for resorting to trends surrounding being scantily clad with provocative tattoos and being perceived as attractive in the process. Not all female rappers, or female artists in general have resorted to these methods within their careers. [...] "..the recent appearance of Black women performers, songwriters, and producers in Black popular culture has called attention {{to the ways in which}} young Black women use popular culture to negotiate social existence and attempt to express independence, self-reliance, and agency".|$|E
5000|$|The {{film was}} {{received}} generally negatively, with The New York Times saying, [...] "Obliged by her Famous Players contract {{to star in}} pedestrian melodramas like The Eternal Grind, it <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that Mary Pickford yearned to become her own producer".|$|R
60|$|As I dressed I {{glanced at}} my watch. It <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that <b>no</b> one <b>was</b> stirring. It was twenty-five minutes past four. I had hardly {{finished}} when Holmes returned {{with the news that}} the boy was putting in the horse.|$|R
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>wonder</b> that Marie {{should be}} {{astonished}} at finding her wedding so confidently spoken of {{by a stranger}} in Echanbroignes, considering {{that it was not}} yet twenty-four hours since Henri had declared his love for her at Clisson.|$|R
