On {{the last day of}} the season, October 3, Boston won their game and Cleveland lost, giving them identical 96–58 records and forcing a tiebreaker the following day at Boston. The Indians chose rookie Gene Bearden to start against Boston in the tie-breaker, despite only having one day of rest, as he <b>had</b> <b>beaten</b> the Red Sox twice that season, and the Red Sox chose Denny Galehouse, passing on Mel Parnell, who <b>had</b> <b>beaten</b> the Indians on three separate occasions that season.|$|E

5|$|In the 2009–10 Iraqi Premier League, {{under the}} {{management}} of Radhi Shenaishil, Al-Talaba finished as the leaders of Group B {{in the first stage}} with 68 points, having won 19 matches, drew 11, and lost four. They withdrew in the twelfth round due to a ruling from the Iraqi Olympic Committee where they were set to face Baghdad that awarded the win. In the elite stage, Al-Talaba ended up in second place of Group One as the best runners-up of the three groups where they had ten points, the same amount of points as the first place, Al-Zawra'a, but they had the goals difference of +2 and Al-Talaba the goals difference of +1. If either Al-Quwa Al-Jawiya <b>had</b> <b>beaten</b> Naft Al-Janoob or Al-Shorta <b>had</b> <b>beaten</b> Najaf FC, Al-Talaba would not have qualified for the semi-finals, but Jawiya drew 0–0 and Al-Shorta drew 2–2.

50|$|A notable {{aspect of}} the rivalry is their ability to beat each other on any given day, {{including}} Grand Slam play, {{making it one of}} the most competitive and evenly matched rivalries in the Open Era. To date Federer is the only man to <b>have</b> <b>beaten</b> Djokovic in all four majors, and likewise Djokovic is the only man to <b>have</b> <b>beaten</b> Federer in all four majors. Both men accomplished this after <b>having</b> <b>beaten</b> each other at Wimbledon. Both players are generally considered to be the two greatest hard court players in the open era.|$|R

5|$|The National League used {{a three-game}} playoff (prior to 1969) {{to break a}} tie for the pennant, the winner of which would face the American League {{champion}} Yankees in the 1951 World Series. The Dodgers won the coin toss for home field advantage, but opted to host game one at Ebbets Field on October 1, while the Giants would as a result get to host games two and three at the Polo Grounds on October 2 and 3. The Dodgers chose Ralph Branca, who also started {{the first game of}} the 1946 tiebreaker, to start game one because he <b>had</b> <b>beaten</b> the Giants twice in the regular season, while the Giants chose Jim Hearn, who <b>had</b> <b>beaten</b> the Dodgers twice that year.|$|E

Ormond lost his first match in charge 5–0 to England, but {{recovered}} to steer Scotland to their first World Cup finals in 16 years in 1974. At the 1974 World Cup finals in West Germany, Scotland achieved their most impressive performance at a World Cup tournament. The team was unbeaten but failed to progress beyond the group stages on goal difference. After beating Zaïre, they drew with both Brazil and Yugoslavia, and went out because they <b>had</b> <b>beaten</b> Zaïre by the smallest margin.|$|E

5|$|For the Persians, the two {{expeditions to}} Greece {{had been largely}} successful; new territories had been added to their empire and Eretria had been punished.

Yet, for the Greeks, it was an enormously significant victory. It {{was the first time}} that Greeks <b>had</b> <b>beaten</b> the Persians, and showed them that the Persians were not invincible, and that resistance, rather than subjugation, was possible.|$|E

Hibs scored two early goals and progressed to the semi-final with a 2–0 victory. In the semi-final, Hibs took on Aberdeen at Hampden Park. Garry O'Connor scored an early goal, and Rory Fallon equalised for Aberdeen {{in the second half}} with a spectacular looping volley. Hibs won 2–1 thanks to a late winning goal by Leigh Griffiths.|$|E

Despite the defeat, Germany qualified for the World Cup after winning a playoff against Ukraine, and Kahn remained as Germany's number one for the upcoming Cup.
