The primary {{difference}} between the M8 and the original M7 coprocessor is that the M8 also includes a barometer to measure altitude changes. Phil Schiller touted that the A8 chip would provide, {{in comparison to the}} 5s, a 25% increase in CPU performance, a 50% increase in graphics performance, and less <b>heat</b> <b>output.</b> Early hands-on reports suggested that the A8's GPU performance might indeed break away from previous generations doubling of performance at each yearly release, scoring 21204.26 in Base mark X compared to 20253.80, 10973.36 and 5034.75 on respectively the 5s, 5 and 4s.|$|E
5|$|Direct {{geothermal}} heating systems contain pumps and compressors, which may consume energy from a polluting source. This parasitic load is normally {{a fraction of}} the <b>heat</b> <b>output,</b> so it is always less polluting than electric heating. However, if the electricity is produced by burning fossil fuels, then the net emissions of {{geothermal heating}} may be comparable to directly burning the fuel for heat. For example, a geothermal heat pump powered by electricity from a combined cycle natural gas plant would produce about as much pollution as a natural gas condensing furnace of the same size. Therefore, the environmental value of direct geothermal heating applications is highly dependent on the emissions intensity of the neighboring electric grid.|$|E

25|$|Stirling engine designs require heat {{exchangers}} for heat input and for <b>heat</b> <b>output,</b> and these must contain {{the pressure of}} the working fluid, where the pressure is proportional to the engine power output. In addition, the expansion-side heat exchanger is often at very high temperature, so the materials must resist the corrosive effects of the heat source, and have low creep. Typically these material requirements substantially increase the cost of the engine. The materials and assembly costs for a high temperature heat exchanger typically accounts for 40% of the total engine cost.|$|E

40|$|We present work on {{measurement}} of the energy performance of heat pumps for hotel operations in subtropical climates. Two city hotels in Hong Kong were investigated. The first case was an application of an air-to-water heat pump to provide heating for an outdoor swimming pool during the heating season. The second case was the installation of three water-to-water heat pumps to complement an existing boiler system for hot water supply. The <b>heating</b> energy <b>output</b> and corresponding electricity use were measured. The heat pump energy efficiency was evaluated {{in terms of the}} coefficient of performance (COP), defined as the <b>heating</b> energy <b>output</b> to the electrical energy use. The air-to-water heat pump provided 49. 1 MWh heating while consuming 24. 6 MWh electricity during the 612 -month heating season from mid-October to April. For the water-to-water heat pumps, the estimated annual <b>heating</b> <b>output</b> and the electricity use were 952 and 544 MWh, respectively.

25|$|Plants {{designed}} for lignite (brown coal) are increasingly used in locations {{as varied as}} Germany, Victoria, Australia and North Dakota. Lignite is a much younger form of coal than black coal. It has a lower energy density than black coal and requires a much larger furnace for equivalent <b>heat</b> <b>output.</b> Such coals may contain up to 70% water and ash, yielding lower furnace temperatures and requiring larger induced-draft fans.

40|$|Climate warming {{over the}} 20 th century has {{increased}} the density stratification and stability of Lake Tanganyika, a deep rift valley lake. Here we examine the physical processes involved in and affected by the warming of the lake, and we discuss effects on lake productivity. The rate of net heat absorption by Lake Tanganyika has been 0. 4 W m 22 since 1913, twice the rate in the global ocean, indicating stronger climate forcing in the East African region. Lakes warm through increased incoming long-wave radiation. While lakes in general will increase <b>heat</b> <b>outputs</b> in a warming climate, <b>heat</b> <b>outputs</b> will increase more slowly in deeper lakes than in shallower lakes. Temperatures have increased by 0. 2 uC at 1000 m in depth, {{in part because of}} reduced cool marginal inflows, while water surface temperatures have increased by about 1. 3 uC. This differential heating over depth {{has increased the}} density gradient through the water column, reducing the potential for vertical mixing and thereby limiting nutrient fluxes to the phototrophic zone. An increase in transparency, indicating a reduction in productivity {{as a result of the}} reduced vertical mixing, occurred both in Lake Tanganyika and in Lake Malawi, a similar deep tropical lake in which warming has also been documented.

25|$|A pellet stove {{is a type}} of {{clean-burning}} stove {{which uses}} small, biological fuel pellets which are renewable and very clean-burning. Home heating using a pellet stove is an alternative currently used throughout the world, with rapid growth in Europe. The pellets are made of renewable material –- typically wood sawdust or off-cuts. There are currently {{more than half a million}} homes in North America using pellet stoves for heat, and probably a similar number in Europe. The pellet stove typically uses a feed screw to transfer pellets from a storage hopper to a combustion chamber. Air is provided for the combustion by an electric blower. The ignition is automatic, using a stream of air heated by an electrical element. The rotation speed of the feeder and the fan speeds can be varied to modulate the <b>heat</b> <b>output.</b>|$|E
25|$|The fuel {{channels}} {{can only}} maintain criticality {{if they are}} mechanically sound. If {{the temperature of the}} fuel bundles increases {{to the point where they}} are mechanically unstable, their horizontal layout means they will bend under gravity, shifting the layout of the bundles and reducing the efficiency of the reactions. Because the original fuel arrangement is optimum for a chain reaction and the natural uranium fuel has little excess reactivity, any significant deformation will stop the inter-fuel pellet fission reaction. This will not stop heat production from fission product decay, which would continue to supply a considerable <b>heat</b> <b>output.</b> If this process further weakens the fuel bundles, they will eventually bend far enough to touch the calandria tube, allowing heat to be efficiently transferred into the moderator tank. The moderator vessel has a considerable thermal capability on its own, and is normally kept relatively cool.|$|E

25|$|In a reactor {{that has}} been {{operating}} for some time, the radioactive fission products will have built up to steady state concentrations such that their rate of decay is equal to their rate of formation, so that their fractional total contribution to reactor heat (via beta decay) {{is the same as}} these radioisotopic fractional contributions to the energy of fission. Under these conditions, the 6.5% of fission which appears as delayed ionizing radiation (delayed gammas and betas from radioactive fission products) contributes to the steady-state reactor heat production under power. It is this output fraction which remains when the reactor is suddenly shut down (undergoes scram). For this reason, the reactor decay <b>heat</b> <b>output</b> begins at 6.5% of the full reactor steady state fission power, once the reactor is shut down. However, within hours, due to decay of these isotopes, the decay power output is far less. See decay heat for detail.|$|E
