3000|$|One <b>important</b> <b>technical</b> <b>advance</b> {{we bring}} {{out in this}} work is the system to {{selectively}} expand SOX 9 + BCs in a feeder-free condition. Previously through bronchoscopic brushing followed by routine basal cell culture, Crystal et al., obtained P 63 +/KRT 5 +/SOX 7 / 15 / 4 + basal cells but not the rare SOX 9 + subpopulation (Hackett et al., 2011) [...]. Here from as few as one single SOX 9 + BC, we can expand it to 5 × 107 purely undifferentiated cells within 3 – 4 weeks. Therefore we can acquire a homogeneous population of regenerative cells with uniform characteristics, which is crucial for cell quality control in further clinical application.|$|E

40|$|The use of {{irradiated}} hosts in {{mass rearing}} tephritid parasitoids represents an <b>important</b> <b>technical</b> <b>advance</b> in fruit fly augmentative biological control. Irradiation assures that fly emergence is avoided in non-parasitized hosts, {{while at the}} same time it has no appreciable effect on parasitoid quality, i. e., fecundity, longevity and flight capability. Parasitoids of fruit fly eggs, larvae and pupae have all been shown to successfully develop in irradiated hosts, allowing a broad range of species to be shipped and released without post-rearing delays waiting for fly emergence and costly procedures to separate flies and wasps. This facilitates the early, more effective and less damaging shipment of natural enemies within hosts and across quarantined borders. In addition, the survival and dispersal of released parasitoids can be monitored by placing irradiated sentinel-hosts in the field. The optimal radiation dosages for host-sterility and parasitoid-fitness differ among species, and considerable progress has been made in integrating radiation into a variety of rearing procedures...|$|E

40|$|Rickettsia prowazekii, the causative {{agent of}} {{epidemic}} typhus, is an obligate intracellular bacterium that replicates {{only within the}} cytosol of a eukaryotic host cell. Despite the barriers to genetic manipulation that such a life style creates, rickettsial mutants have been generated by transposon insertion {{as well as by}} homologous recombination mechanisms. However, progress is hampered by the length of time required to identify and isolate R. prowazekii transformants. To reduce the time required and variability associated with propagation and harvesting of rickettsiae for each transformation experiment, characterized frozen stocks were used to generate electrocompetent rickettsiae. Transformation experiments employing these rickettsiae established that fluorescent rickettsial populations could be identified using a fluorescence activated cell sorter within one week following electroporation. Early detection was improved with increasing amounts of transforming DNA. In addition, we demonstrate that heterogeneous populations of rickettsiae-infected cells can be sorted into distinct sub-populations {{based on the number of}} rickettsiae per cell. Together our data suggest the combination of fluorescent reporters and cell sorting represent an <b>important</b> <b>technical</b> <b>advance</b> that will facilitate isolation of distinct R. prowazekii mutants and allow for closer examination of the effects of infection on host cells at various infectious burdens...|$|E
30|$|When using QR Codes™ as triggers, {{which can}} be {{downloaded}} and printed out, no additional hardware, i.e., sets of RFID or NFC tags, has to be distributed. Thus, the system can remotely be made available for download. Some minor technical details are subject to our further investigation and development, such as {{the design of the}} application surface. Furthermore, strategies for accurate review and quality control of the teaching material have to be implemented. Programming and indexing tags with their corresponding video clips may be time consuming, as it is for any ultrasound video loop editing for educational purposes. As some mobile devices failed to feed battery power to the RFID antennas, the capability of using different triggering solutions provides a useful backup plan. Finally, the sole triggering of a video clip to be displayed does not encompass probe manipulation and image optimization skills as commercially available systems do, which is another field of further technical development for the system. Furthermore, the video output format of ultrasound machines and the anonymizing function varies. Several different file types and codecs may hamper their universal utilization for an ultrasound simulation library. This can easily be overcome using free file converters.

40|$|AIMS [...] To {{evaluate}} {{the effect of}} microwave irradiation on the staining quality {{of a range of}} commonly used primary antibodies in archival, formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded material, with emphasis on antibodies that have previously worked successfully only on frozen tissue. METHODS [...] Immunocytochemistry (streptavidin-biotin complex technique) was performed on histological sections of a range of normal and pathological tissues, after varying treatment with microwave irradiation. The staining quality of each antibody was compared with that achieved without prior treatment of the sections or after enzyme predigestion. RESULTS [...] Microwave irradiation permitted successful immunostaining with 20 antibodies that stained only frozen tissues before. The staining characteristics of 21 antibodies that were already known to stain formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded material were improved. Another 39 antibodies did not show enhanced staining with microwave irradiation. The method preserves tissue morphology and produces more consistent staining than that achieved by enzyme predigestion with many antibodies. Microwave irradiation may also allow some primary antibodies to be used at higher working dilutions. The citrate buffer used in this study avoids the necessity of exposure to heavy metal salts. CONCLUSIONS [...] Microwave antigen retrieval represents an <b>important</b> <b>technical</b> <b>advance</b> within immunocytochemistry that will greatly increase the range of antibodies which can be used to study formalin fixed, paraffin wax embedded tissues...|$|E

30|$|Three {{dimensional}} terrestrial {{laser scanning}} (TLS) and airborne laser scanning (ALS) possibly represent the most <b>important</b> <b>technical</b> <b>advances</b> in measurement and monitoring techniques relevant to forest observational studies. Ground-based TLS {{is used to}} measure objects in three dimensional space by emitting a laser beam and scanning the surface of surrounding objects using impulse or phase-based systems (Seidel 2014). Terrestrial laser scanning provides data about tree position, height, diameter at breast height, crown dimension, as well as tree lean, sweep and taper. However, suitable software for analysing the huge amounts of raw data {{does not seem to}} be freely available yet. ALS is based on similar technical principles, but the scanner is usually mounted on a small aircraft or helicopter. Possibly the first comprehensive textbook about forest applications of airborne laser scanning is the work by Maltamo et al. (2014) which provides a comprehensive, state-of-the-art review of the research and application of ALS in a broad range of forest-related disciplines. Some chapters deal with methodological detail while others review and illustrate the use of ALS within various domains of application to forest ecosystems.|$|R
40|$|The radio {{frequency}} quadrupole (RFQ) accelerator began as 'The ion linear accelerator with space-uniform strong focusing' conceived by I. M. Kapchinskii and V. A. Teplyakove. In 1979, R. H. Stokes, K. R. Crandall, J. E. Stovall and D. A. Swenson gave this concept the name RFQ. And by 1983, at least 15 laboratories {{throughout the world}} were working on various FWQ designs. In the early years, there were many types of geometry considered for the RFQ, {{but only a few}} types have survived. The two cavity geometries now used in almost all RFQs are the 4 -vane and 4 -rod structures. The 4 -vane structure is the most popular because its operating frequency range (80 to - 500 MHz) is suitable for light ions. Heavy ions require low frequencies (below 200 MHz). Because the 4 -rod structure has smaller transverse dimensions than a 4 -vane RFQ at the same frequency, the 4 -rod RFQ is often preferred for these applications. This paper will describe how the RFQ accelerates and focuses the beam. The paper also discusses some of the <b>important</b> <b>technical</b> <b>advances</b> in designing and building RFQs...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} <b>important</b> <b>technical</b> <b>advances</b> made {{in recent years}} in the area of both digital {{radiography}} as well as multidetector computed tomography (MDCT) have improved detection and staging of bronchial carcinoma. The aim of elaborate processing such as temporal subtraction, rib suppression, dual energy subtraction or CAD is to aid the radiologist in detecting lung tumors at the earliest stage possible. For both CT and radiography techniques the differentiation between true and false positive lesions seems to be the biggest challenge. MDCT with multiplanar projections is the imaging method of choice for staging of the extent of local tumor spread (T staging), while N staging and M staging are the domain of positron emission tomography (PET) or even better of integrated PET/CT. Management rules for follow-up of solid and semi-solid lesions seen in CT consider the risks of the patient and are summarized in international guidelines. In 2009 a new 7 th edition of the TNM classification was published, which, among other aspects, sub-classifies tumor size more specifically and the presence of a satellite nodule in the tumor lobe is down-staged to T 3 and no longer determines tumor resectability. The N staging was not modified. One of the most important new features {{is the fact that the}} new classification no longer applies only to non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) but also to SCLC and carcinoid tumor...|$|R
30|$|Lipid {{nanoparticles}} (liposomes) {{were first}} described in 1965, and several work {{have led to}} development of <b>important</b> <b>technical</b> <b>advances</b> like triggered release liposomes and drug-loaded liposomes.

Quite a number of liposomes are on the market, and many more are still in developmental stage. Lipid nanoparticles are the first nano-medicine delivery system to be advanced from laboratory concept to clinical application with high considerable clinical acceptance. Drug delivery systems for local anesthetics (LAs) have caught the interest of many researchers because there are many biomedical advantages connected to their application. There have been several formulation techniques to systemically deliver LA that include encapsulation in liposomes and complexation in cyclodextrins, nanoparticles, and to a little extent gold nanoparticles. The proposed formulations help to decrease the LA concentration utilized, increase its permeability, and most importantly increase the localization of the LA {{for a long period of}} time thereby leading to increase in the duration of the LA effect and finally to reduce any local and systemic toxicity. In this review, we will highlight on new updates pertaining to drug delivery of local anesthetics in particular bupivacaine using lipid nanoparticles.|$|R

In the past decade, safer contrast agents have been used and there have been <b>important</b> <b>technical</b> <b>advances</b> including smaller catheters, hydrophylic guide wires, and digital imaging systems. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the neurological complication rates of cerebral angiography performed for inpatients. Methods A prospective study was conducted from January 2009 until December 2011. The patient’s demographic characteristics, the procedural details as well as complications appearing during and after the procedure were documented. Neurological complications are classified based on the international classification: (a) transient, disappearing within 24 hours; (b) reversible, lasting more than 24 hours but less than 7 days; (c) permanent, if the complication last for more than 7 days. The complications were examined by a neurologist. Results The patients comprised 82 (41 %) women and 118 (59 %) men, ranging from 11 to 86 years of age. From 200 patients who underwent the procedure, permanent neurological complications were found in 1 (0. 50 %) patient. Neither reversible nor transient neurological complications were found. Conclusion The cerebral {{digital subtraction angiography}} procedure, when conducted by a neuro interventionist, is relatively save, both from the aspect of neurological and non-neurological complications, and from the number of deaths.

40|$|The {{invention}} of the printing press by Gutenberg in the mid-fifteenth century {{is one of the}} most <b>important</b> <b>technical</b> <b>advances</b> in history. It had a profound impact on European civilization and gave birth to the first great “media revolution”. The immediate effect was to multiply the amount of books in circulation and to reduce their cost. The Gutenberg revolution carried the European book market to a new level. Booksellers had to deal with multiple hundreds of copies, not rather than in single copies as at the manuscript age. The name of Gutenberg would not have been associated with the {{invention of}} western modernity without the action of these bookmen. Until now, researches on the early history of printed books have been mainly focused on the world of printers, the production of books and on lectors and their reading practices. The intermediate level of the book industry has remained more or less neglected. However, some recent works have highlighted the fact that the engine and the frame of the Gutenberg revolution lied precisely in the structures and the evolution of book diffusion. My conference will focus on the trade relations between France and the Low Countries which have never been the subject of systematic analysis.

Here we integrate historic and biocultural research involving Aboriginal people, with chloroplast and nuclear genomic data to demonstrate Aboriginal-mediated dispersal of a non-cultivated rainforest tree. We assembled new anthropological evidence of use and deliberate dispersal of Castanospermum australe (Fabaceae), a non-cultivated culturally important riparian tree that produces toxic but highly nutritious water-dispersed seed. We validated cultural evidence of recent human-mediated dispersal by revealing genomic homogeneity across extensively dissected habitat, multiple catchments and uneven topography in the southern range of this species. We excluded the potential contribution of other dispersal mechanisms based on the absence of suitable vectors and current distributional patterns at higher elevations and away from water courses, and by analyzing a comparative sample from northern Australia. Innovative studies integrating evolutionary and anthropological data will continue to reveal the unexpected impact that prehistoric people have had on current vegetation patterns. A better understanding of how traditional practices shaped species' distribution and assembly will directly inform cultural heritage management strategies, challenge "natural" species distribution assumptions, and provide innovative baseline data for pro-active biodiversity management...|$|R

One of the most <b>important</b> <b>technical</b> <b>advances</b> in diagnosis of tuberculosis {{is the development of}} nucleic acid amplification (NAA) tests. However, the choice of the target sequence remains controversial in NAA tests. Recently, interesting alternatives have been found in hypothetical protein coding sequences from mycobacterial genome. Methodology/Principal Findings: To obtain rational biomarker for TB diagnosis, the conservation of three hypothetical genes was firstly evaluated in 714 mycobacterial strains. The results showed that SCAR 1 (Sequenced Characterized Amplified Region) based on Rv 0264 c coding gene showed the highest conservation (99. 8 %) and SCAR 2 based on Rv 1508 c gene showed the secondary high conservation (99. 7 %) in M. tuberculosis (MTB) strains. SCAR 3 based on Rv 2135 c gene (3. 2 %) and IS 6110 (8 %) showed relatively high deletion rate in MTB strains. Secondly, three SCAR markers were evaluated in 307 clinical sputum from patients in whom TB was suspected or patients with diseases other than TB. The amplification of IS 6110 and 16 SrRNA sequences together with both clinical and bacteriological identification was as a protocol to evaluate the efficacy of SCAR markers. The sensitivities and specificities, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of all NAA tests were higher than those of bacteriological detection.
