50|$|A surveyor's wheel, {{also called}} a clickwheel, <b>hodometer,</b> waywiser, trundle wheel, {{measuring}} wheel or perambulator is a device for measuring distance.|$|E
50|$|The {{origins of}} the surveyor's wheel are {{connected}} to the {{origins of the}} odometer. While the latter is derived to measure distances travelled by a vehicle, the former is specialized to measure distances. Much of the material on the earliest stages {{in the development of the}} <b>hodometer</b> are adequately covered in odometer.|$|E
50|$|That Vitruvius {{must have}} been well practised in {{surveying}} is shown by his descriptions of surveying instruments, especially the water level or chorobates, which he compared favourably with the groma, a device using plumb lines. They were essential in all building operations, but especially in aqueduct construction, where a uniform gradient was important to provision of a regular supply of water without damage to {{the walls of the}} channel. He described the <b>hodometer,</b> in essence a device for automatically measuring distances along roads, a machine essential for developing accurate itineraries, such as the Peutinger Table.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, double-wheel <b>hodometers</b> were constructed.|$|R
40|$|The primary aim of {{this paper}} is to provide a simple and {{concrete}} interpretation of Cartan geometry in terms of the mathematics of idealized waywisers. Waywisers, also called <b>hodometers,</b> are instruments traditionally used to measure distances. The mathematical representation of an idealized waywiser consists of a choice of symmetric space called a model space and represents the `wheel' of the idealized waywiser. The geometry of a manifold is then completely characterized by a pair of variables {V^A(x),A^AB(x) }, each of which admit simple interpretations: V^A is the point of contact between the waywiser's idealized wheel and the manifold whose geometry one wishes to characterize, and A^AB=A_μ^μ ABdx^μ is a connection one-form dictating how much the idealized wheel of the waywiser has rotated when rolled along the manifold. The familiar objects from differential geometry (e. g. metric g_μν, affine connection Γ^ρ_μν, co-tetrad e^I, torsion T^I, spin-connection ω^IJ, Riemannian curvature R^IJ) can be seen as compound objects made out of the waywiser variables {V^A,A^AB}. We then generalize this waywiser approach to relativistic spacetimes and exhibit action principles for General Relativity in terms of the waywiser variables for two choices of model spacetimes: De Sitter and anti-De Sitter spacetimes.
