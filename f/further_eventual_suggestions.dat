40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the concept and legal {{implications}} of excessive self-defense (private defense) and necessity (distress). The two terms designate two circumstances precluding wrongfulness that the Czech Criminal Code recognizes. They have been intended to allow every person to defend himself and thus protect his rights against an attack {{or other forms of}} danger in case the state authority cannot provide for such protection. If the self- protection is executed within some acceptable boundaries that are provided by the Criminal Code, such behavior can be considered beneficial for the society and therefore nobody should be in any way punished for it. Criminal liability is only established when the given boundaries are crossed and even then there is a certain favored approach towards the perpetrator required. The intention of this thesis is to address the connotations and importance of the given juridical institutes and to evaluate whether they function effectively or not, with <b>eventual</b> <b>suggestions</b> as to how to improve the result.

First, we summarize the main theoretical and empirical findings about determinants of current account deficits and possible implications of monetary union. Second, an empirical analysis of possible effects of single currency on current account is presented. We employ time-specific fixed effect estimator, corrected for possible endogeneity between fiscal policy stance and current account deficits. Our results support hypothesis of certain impact on current account balances as such. We also document positive effect of single currency on gross saving and investment rates.

Nematodes cause galls (knots) to form on both roots and pods of the peanut, and these galls are highly diagnostic for root-knot nematode presence compared to other nematodes affecting peanut. The presence of galls on roots, pegs and pods appears as single or multiple wart-like growths {{that may or may not}} be discolored.

40|$|Androgen {{receptor}} (AR) is {{a nuclear}} transcription factor that binds male sex steroids and mediates the biological {{effects of these}} hormones to the target cells, such as the epithelial cells of the prostate gland, by activating transcription of androgen-dependent genes. Withdrawal of androgens or the peripheral blockade of androgen action remain the critical therapeutic options {{for the treatment of}} advanced prostate cancer. However, after initial regression, many prostate cancers become hormone refractory and progress <b>further</b> with <b>eventual</b> fatal outcome. Understanding the mechanisms of tumor progression and endocrine therapy failure is an important goal. A large number of different molecular mechanisms may be responsible for development of hormone-refractory recurrent tumors. Many of these involve the AR gene and its complex downstream signaling pathways. The role of AR mutations and altered transactivational properties of the receptor have received the most attention as causative factors for progression. However, other mechanisms, such as AR gene amplification and overexpression or increased local bioconversion of androgens, may {{contribute to the development of}} progression by mechanisms that involve androgen-dependent cell growth. Here we review the role of the AR gene and its putative downstream effector pathways during human prostate cancer progression and endocrine therapy failure...|$|R
5000|$|... 2007 World Cup round 2, Champéry, Switzerland After placing fifth at {{round one}} in Vigo, Spain, {{all eyes were}} glued on Sam Hill in round two. The {{extremely}} steep and technical track seemed almost tailor made for the young Australian. All {{seemed to be going}} well for Hill when he qualified in first place early on race day, besting the second place qualifier by over 14 seconds! Hill was looking confident for Finals. However, with approximately 30 riders left to set off, on arguably the most dangerous course the world cup series has seen in many years, the skies opened up. It had rained every day at this time the whole weekend, but not this hard. Riders who qualified in the top ten, were seen finishing in the late forties, early fifties. When last man to down the track, Hill, set off, no one could believe their eyes. The World Champion at the time was ripping down the track faster than top riders were riding it in the bone dry, perfect conditions. Hill's split time was faster than second place (Steve Peat, who raced in the dry), but a fall later in his run meant the Aussie ended up in a very respectable third position, just 1.63sec off first place rider Matti Lehikoinen, who also completed his final run in the dry. Hill's run will {{go down in history as}} one of the greatest runs in the wet, if not one of the greatest ever. Dan Atherton later quoted [...] "He showed us all that it ain't over, 'till its truly over". <b>Further,</b> <b>eventual</b> winner Matti Lehikoinen stated after the race [...] "I played the tactics (referring to a 20-second pause in his practice run, ensuring a lower qualifying position to avoid any unfavourable weather changes), but Sam is the winner of the day. No questions". Steve Peat said [...] "Sam is the King - give him the crown." [...] Despite his remarkable and certainly unmatched talent for riding in unfavorable conditions, Sam admits that he rarely rides in the rain. In an interview with Steve Jones of Dirt Magazine featured in the film 'Earthed 5: The Law of Fives', when asked if it rained that hard in Australia and if he was used to riding in such conditions Sam replied [...] "I don't even see a raindrop when I'm in Australia". Jones then asked [...] "So you never ride in the rain?" [...] Hill's reply was simply, [...] "My bike gets muddy".|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn {{decision-making}} problems where uncertainty plays a {{key role}} and decisions have to be taken prior to observing uncertainty, chance constraints are a strong modelling tool for defining safety of decisions. These constraints request that a random inequality system depending on a decision vector has to be satisfied with a high probability. The characteristics of the feasible set of such chance constraints depend on the constraint mapping of the random inequality system, the underlying law of uncertainty and the probability level. One characteristic of particular interest is convexity. Convexity can be shown under fairly general conditions on the underlying law of uncertainty and on the constraint mapping, regardless of the probability-level. In some situations, convexity can only be shown when the probability-level is high enough. This is defined as eventual convexity. In this paper, we will investigate <b>further</b> how <b>eventual</b> convexity can be assured for specially structured chance constraints involving Copulae. The Copulae have to exhibit generalized concavity properties. In particular, we will extend recent results and exhibit a clear link between the generalized concavity properties of the various mappings involved in the chance constraint for the result to hold.

The CoTeLab has prepared a questionnaire including the main groups of interest of Laboratory Technologists, either of a specific or general nature, {{as well as other}} <b>eventual</b> arguments, <b>suggestions</b> and observations {{in order to understand the}} real necessity of training. The questionnaire was answered by 464 technicians of which 71 % females and 29 % males, most of interviewed were between 41 and 45 years of age with variable experience. Scolarity was not homogeneous due to Italian evolution in the past years. The necessity to up-date knowledge in the laboratory in which day-to-day work is performed and an elevated interest in molecular biology was evidenced. Quality control, biological hazard and hospital infections were the arguments most requested. The procedure of accreditation and/or certification already obtained in many laboratories, and the problems involved in new technologies are certainly factors that bring attention to Quality Control. The response in respect of biological hazards is due to the implementation of DL 626 / 94 and its successive modifications. Hospital infections have always been an important subject of microbiology and have gained much attention thanks to the new technologies offered (molecular epidemiology) Theoretical and practical training is mainly requested and evidences the technician’s need to understand routine procedures and not only to perform them. New technologies are the general arguments most requested and preferred. Surprisingly long distance education is not requested, probably since it has not yet been activated and the modality is not clear. In conclusion this study has hallowed us to have a reliable perspective of the educational needs of technologists and will permit us to gradually construct a high quality, efficient continuing education program that will certainly give positive results in the total quality of results referred to physicians...|$|R
