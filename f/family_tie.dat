They were joined in the first episode by two of Foreman's schoolteachers, Barbara Wright (Jacqueline Hill) and Ian Chesterton (William Russell), from contemporary 20th century England. This remained the line-up of the series for the entire first season, but over time the regular line-up would change regularly as the Doctor's various companions left him to return home, having found new causes on worlds they had visited and elected to stay there, or even occasionally being killed off. However, he would always quickly find new travelling companions.

500|$|In 1052, Macbeth was {{involved}} indirectly in the strife in the Kingdom of England between Godwin, Earl of Wessex and Edward the Confessor {{when he received}} a number of Norman exiles from England in his court, perhaps becoming the first king of Scots to introduce feudalism to Scotland. In 1054, Edward's Earl of Northumbria, Siward, led a very large invasion of Scotland (Duncan's widow and Malcolm's mother, Suthed, was Northumbrian-born; it is probable but not proven {{that there was a}} <b>family</b> <b>tie</b> between Siward and Malcolm). The campaign led to a bloody battle in which the Annals of Ulster report 3,000 Scots and 1,500 English dead, which can be taken as meaning very many on both sides, and one of Siward's sons and a son-in-law were among the dead. The result of the invasion was that one Máel Coluim, [...] "son of the king of the Cumbrians" [...] (not to be confused with Máel Coluim mac Donnchada, the future Malcolm III of Scotland) was restored to his throne, i.e., as ruler of the kingdom of Strathclyde. It may be that the events of 1054 are responsible for the idea, which appears in Shakespeare's play, that Malcolm III was put in power by the English.|$|E
2500|$|For example, the UK interprets [...] "{{residence}} card" [...] in Article 5(2) of the Directive to mean [...] "UK" [...] residence card, and ignores other cards, instead requiring an [...] "EEA family permit" [...] {{contrary to}} the Directive. Showing the <b>family</b> <b>tie</b> with the EU national by other means (as mentioned above) should circumvent this. Denmark and Ireland do not prescribe that a valid residence card will exempt non-EEA family members from the visa requirement. Spain only permits residence cards from Schengen countries, therefore cards from the UK, Ireland, Bulgaria, Romania, and Cyprus are not allowed. The Spanish legislation is not in conformity with the Directive. Austria, somewhat like the UK, seems to require a permanent residence card issued by the Austrian authorities to enter without visa.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to elucidate the role of <b>family</b> <b>ties</b> and socio-economic status on the likelihood to trust general others. Although the effects of both factors have already been studied separately, this study will present the effects of both factors in one model. Based on earlier research, the strength of <b>family</b> <b>ties</b> is predicted to have a negative influence on the likelihood to trust general others. Theory implies socio-economic status to be positively related to general trust. As earlier studies show a correlation between socio-economic status and <b>family</b> <b>ties,</b> the third hypothesis compares the predictors and the fourth hypothesis tests an interaction effect. Data was obtained from the 2004 General Social Survey. Logistic regression was used to test the hypothesis and confirmed the first and second hypotheses. Socio-economic status predicted the likelihood to trust general others slightly better than the strength of <b>family</b> <b>ties.</b> The model with both socio-economic status and <b>family</b> <b>ties</b> included had the best model fit. Only the interaction effect fell short of significance...|$|R

60|$|About {{twenty years}} since there {{lived in one}} of our shiretowns a family, which, in its {{different}} branches, had numerous female descendants, then all children. A member of this family, one day, went to a respectable clergyman, his friend, and told him that he and his connexions had so many female children, whom it was time to think of educating, that they had hit upon the plan of engaging some suitable instructress, with the intention of educating their girls all together, both for economy's sake and for convenience, as well as that such near connexions might be brought up in a way to strengthen the <b>family</b> <b>tie.</b> The clergyman warmly remonstrated against the scheme, assuring his friend, that the community would not bear it, and that it would infallibly make enemies! This was the feeling of a very sensible man, and of an experienced divine, and I was myself the person making the application. This is religiously true, and I have often thought of the circumstance since, equally with astonishment and horror.|$|E
60|$|The Low Germans, in {{the third}} century after Christ, {{occupied}} in the main the belt of flat country between the Baltic and the mouths of the Rhine. Between them and the old High German Swabians lay a race intermediate in tongue and blood, the Franks. The Low Germans were divided, like most other barbaric races, into several fluctuating and ill-marked tribes, whose names are loosely and perhaps interchangeably used by the few authorities which remain to us. We must not expect to find among them the definiteness of modern civilised nations, but rather such a vagueness as that which characterised the loose confederacies of North American Indians or the various shifting peoples of South Africa. But there are three of their tribes which stand fairly well marked off from one another in early history, and which bore, at least, the chief share in the colonisation of Britain. These three tribes are the Jutes, the English, and the Saxons. Closely connected with them, but less strictly bound in the same <b>family</b> <b>tie,</b> were the Frisians.|$|E

Crucially, even when in-house <b>family</b> <b>ties</b> are perceived as uncomplicated, there is a latent risk that problems might arise. The interpretation of the role of in-house <b>family</b> <b>ties</b> is also strongly related to whether they are paired with asymmetrical (vertical) power relations.

Still, as I should have liked the woman I loved to agree with me in opinion as much as possible in everything, I was not disposed to judge harshly of my sister on that account. On the other hand, to my surprise, I found Miss Priscilla a zealous, and, to say the truth, a somewhat blind patriot; condemning England, the king, and the efforts of parliament with a warmth that was only equal to that with which she defended everything, act, measure, principle, or policy, that was purely American.|$|E
60|$|Bulstrode {{was indeed}} more {{tortured}} than the coarse fibre of Raffles could {{enable him to}} imagine. He had told his wife that he was simply taking care of this wretched creature, the victim of vice, who might otherwise injure himself; he implied, without the direct form of falsehood, {{that there was a}} <b>family</b> <b>tie</b> which bound him to this care, and that there were signs of mental alienation in Raffles which urged caution. He would himself drive the unfortunate being away the next morning. In these hints he felt that he was supplying Mrs. Bulstrode with precautionary information for his daughters and servants, and accounting for his allowing no one but himself to enter the room even with food and drink. But he sat in an agony of fear lest Raffles should be overheard in his loud and plain references to past facts--lest Mrs. Bulstrode should be even tempted to listen at the door. How could he hinder her, how betray his terror by opening the door to detect her? She was a woman of honest direct habits, and little likely to take so low a course in order to arrive at painful knowledge; but fear was stronger than the calculation of probabilities.|$|E
6000|$|The triumphant {{confidence}} of the Mayor founded on Mr. Featherstone's insistent demand that Fred and his mother should not leave him, was a feeble emotion compared with all that was agitating the breasts of the old man's blood-relations, who naturally manifested more their sense of the <b>family</b> <b>tie</b> and were more visibly numerous {{now that he had}} become bedridden. Naturally: for when [...] "poor Peter" [...] had occupied his arm-chair in the wainscoted parlor, no assiduous beetles for whom the cook prepares boiling water could have been less welcome on a hearth which they had reasons for preferring, than those persons whose Featherstone blood was ill-nourished, not from penuriousness on their part, but from poverty. Brother Solomon and Sister Jane were rich, and the family candor and total abstinence from false politeness with which they were always received seemed to them no argument that their brother in the solemn act of making his will would overlook the superior claims of wealth. Themselves at least he had never been unnatural enough to banish from his house, and it seemed hardly eccentric that he should have kept away Brother Jonah, Sister Martha, and the rest, who had no shadow of such claims.

This cross-country heterogeneity arises because strong <b>family</b> <b>ties</b> not only foster traditional family values (which have disruptive effects on economic outcomes), but also provide economically valuable social networks - especially in societies characterised by weak institutions and limited market access.

60|$|Those {{who care}} to {{initiate}} {{and carry on}} a family chronicle illustrated by abundant photographic portraiture, will produce a work that they and {{their children and their}} descendants in more remote generations will assuredly be grateful for. The <b>family</b> <b>tie</b> has a real as well as a traditional significance. The world is beginning to awaken {{to the fact that the}} life of the individual is in some real sense a prolongation of those of his ancestry. His vigour, his character, and his diseases are principally derived from theirs; sometimes his faculties are blends of ancestral qualities; but more frequently they are mosaics, patches of resemblance to one or other of them showing now here and now there. The life-histories of our relatives are prophetic of our own futures; they are far more instructive to us than those of strangers, far more fitted to encourage and to forewarn us. If there be such a thing as a natural birthright, I can conceive of none superior to the right of the child to be informed, at first by proxy through his guardians, and afterwards personally, of the life-history, medical and other, of his ancestry. The child is thrust into existence without his having any voice at all in the matter, and the smallest amend that those who brought him here can make, is to furnish him with all the guidance they can, including the complete life-histories of his near progenitors.|$|E
60|$|Next {{came that}} more {{difficult}} matter, {{the discussion of}} ways and means, the more practical details. Alan hardly knew at first on what precise terms it was Herminia's wish that they two should pass their lives together. His ideas were all naturally framed on the old model of marriage; in that matter, Herminia said, {{he was still in}} the gall of bitterness, and the bond of iniquity. He took it for granted that of course they must dwell under one roof with one another. But that simple ancestral notion, derived from man's lordship in his own house, was wholly adverse to Herminia's views of the reasonable and natural. She had debated these problems at full in her own mind for years, and had arrived at definite and consistent solutions for every knotty point in them. Why should this friendship differ at all, she asked, in respect of time and place, from any other friendship? The notion of necessarily keeping house together, the cramping idea of the <b>family</b> <b>tie,</b> belonged entirely to the regime of the manmade patriarchate, where the woman and the children were the slaves and chattels of the lord and master. In a free society, was it not obvious that each woman would live her own life apart, would preserve her independence, and would receive the visits of the man for whom she cared,--the father of her children? Then only could she be free. Any other method meant the economic and social superiority of the man, and was irreconcilable with the perfect individuality of the woman.|$|E

He had nothing now to offer to that queenly princess worthy of the acceptance of any woman. He was a base-born son, about to be turned out of his father's house because of the disgrace of his birth. In the eye of the law he was nobody.

The old Squire had understood well how to supersede the law, and to make the harshness of man's enactments of no avail.

But now he could not even wait to be told. He must tell it himself, and must vanish. He had failed to understand it all while his father was struggling and was yet alive; but he understood it well now. So he came in to his breakfast, resolved that he would write that letter at once.|$|E
