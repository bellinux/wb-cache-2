500|$|Cambridge won {{the coin}} toss and elected {{to start from}} the {{northern}} bank (the [...] "Middlesex side") of the Thames. [...] Despite Cambridge's cox Griggs having <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>raised</b> (to indicate that she and the Cambridge crew were {{not yet ready to}} commence), race umpire Simon Harris started the race. [...] With a stroke rate of 51, Oxford took an early lead, but Cambridge pulled level as the crews passed Craven Cottage. [...] Taking a slight lead round the Surrey bend, Cambridge's number four, Mayer suffered an asthma attack and collapsed, allowing Oxford to draw up to within a second as they approached Barnes Bridge. [...] In a sprint finish, Oxford pulled away to be three-quarters of a length clear at the finishing post.|$|E
6000|$|JULIA. Yes: I {{believe you}} really care for me. (He {{approaches}} her eagerly: {{she has a}} violent revulsion, and rises with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>raised</b> as if to beat him off, crying) No, no, no, no. I cannot. It's impossible. (She goes towards the door.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sh!" [...] {{she hissed}} at me, smiling, <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>raised.</b> [...] "Should he hear you, he might {{send you to}} the cage for sacrilege. O Agostino!" [...] she cried, and the smiles all {{vanished}} from her face. [...] "Will you grow cruel and suspicious, too?" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{held out}} <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> She <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> eyes--and looked at me.|$|R
40|$|Photograph of Woman in trance at Mass, St. Thomas, Los Angeles, 1996. A {{woman wearing}} a cross {{necklace}} and cross earrings {{stands in the middle}} of the church with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>raised</b> and <b>her</b> eyes closed. Her palms are facing up and her mouth is open. She stands in a pew with some other church goers, who have their <b>hands</b> <b>raised</b> as well...|$|R
40|$|A {{little child}} has <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>raised</b> behind <b>her</b> head doing gymnastics.; The {{back of the}} {{postcard}} is blank and contains a printed title "Missions Du Cameroun, 68 - > ou la lecon de gymnastique" ("Mammouna or the lesson of gymnastics"), {{and the name of}} the publisher "Maison Jean-Bernard. Editeur. Saint-Etienne"...|$|R
60|$|But {{she paused}} with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>raised,</b> as if turned to stone, for {{as she spoke}} the white figure went slowly by. Julia dived into the closet, with one spring. Sally, however, was on her mettle now, and, holding her breath, leaned out to watch. With soundless steps the veiled thing went along the roof, and paused at the further end.|$|E
60|$|Every one slept late at Mrs. Montgomery's on Sunday morning; all sects {{united in}} this {{observance}} of the day; {{in fact you}} could not get breakfast till nine. Cornelia opened her door somewhat later even than this, and started {{at the sight of}} Charmian Maybough standing there, with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>raised</b> in act to knock. They exchanged little shrieks of alarm.|$|E
6000|$|The {{children}} came eagerly up, and Lucilla, taking <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>raised</b> {{her face to}} kiss the stranger; but Robert did not approve of the proceeding, and held up his head. Lucilla rose on tiptoe; Robin did the same. As he {{had the advantage of}} a whole year's height, he fully succeeded in keeping out of her reach; and very comical was the effect. She gave it up at last, and contented herself with asking, 'And where do you come from?' ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the upper}} tier of the apsidal wall is {{depicted}} the Blessed Virgin Mary, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>raised</b> in prophecy, flanked by four archangels. In {{the second and}} third tiers, on either the side of the central window, are figures of apostles and evangelists, placed according to a planned theological programme.|$|R
60|$|For {{a moment}} she stood still, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>raised</b> high above <b>her</b> head, and {{as she did so}} the white robe slipped from her down to her golden girdle, baring the {{blinding}} loveliness of her form. She stood there, her fingers clenched, and the awful look of malevolence gathered and deepened on her face.|$|R
6000|$|... (She steals off by {{the door}} to her room, calling to her husband to do likewise. He takes a step after her, and stops in the grip of the two words that holds them all. The stillness continues. At last MRS. PURDIE goes out into the wood, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>raised,</b> and is {{swallowed}} up by it.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was looking}} for you; he had {{prepared}} me. We're such old friends!" [...] said the actress in a tone courteously exempt from intention: upon which Sherringham, again taking <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>raised</b> {{it to his lips}} with a tenderness which her whole appearance seemed to bespeak for her, a sort of practical consideration and carefulness of touch, as if she were an object precious and frail, an instrument for producing rare sounds, to be handled, like a legendary violin, with a recognition of its value.|$|E
6000|$|As I {{passed the}} kitchen window, I saw Pomona at work. She looked at me, dropped something, and I heard a crash. I don't {{know how much}} that crash cost me. Jonas rushed in to tell Pomona about it, {{and in a moment}} I heard a scream of laughter. At this, Euphemia {{appeared}} at an upper window, with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>raised</b> and saying, severely: [...] "Hush-h!" [...] But the moment she saw me, she disappeared from the window and came down-stairs on the run. She met me, just as I entered the dining-room.|$|E
60|$|Following the {{direction}} of that skinny hand Courtier saw on a balcony Lord and Lady Valleys, side by side, looking steadily down at the crowd. There too, leaning against a window and talking to someone behind, was Barbara. The old man went on muttering, and Courtier could see that his eyes had grown very bright, his whole face transfigured by intense hostility; he felt drawn to this old creature, thus moved to the very soul. Then he saw Barbara looking down at him, with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>raised</b> to her temple to show that she saw his bandaged head. He had {{the presence of mind}} not to lift his hat.|$|E
60|$|Moses {{came toward}} her, and kneeling, {{tried to take}} <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> She <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> head angrily, and again repulsed him.|$|R
60|$|The nurse {{bent over}} {{him with a}} glass in <b>her</b> <b>hand.</b> She <b>raised</b> him a little with the other arm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us go," [...] Stephen murmured entreatingly, rising, {{and taking}} <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> to <b>raise</b> <b>her</b> too. [...] "We {{shall not be}} long together." ...|$|R
60|$|Thus he prayed, but {{although}} {{his hands were}} uplifted, {{it seemed to me}} that his eyes were fixed upon our guide, as ours were. While he spoke, I saw <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>raised,</b> as she had raised it when she slew or rather sentenced the witchdoctor. Then she seemed to reflect, and stayed it in mid air, so that it pointed at the Khania. She did not move, she made no sound, only she pointed, and, the angry words died upon Atene's lips, the fury left her eyes, and the colour her face. Yes, she grew white and silent as the corpse upon the bier behind her. Then, cowed by that invisible power, she struck her horse so fiercely that it bounded by us onward towards the village, at which the funeral company were to rest awhile.|$|E
6000|$|She was too {{startled to}} say anything; he was contemplating with a {{penetrating}} and motionless stare the cracked marble urn {{as though he}} had resolved to fix its shape for ever in his memory. It was only when, turning suddenly to her, he blurted out twice, [...] "I've come to you--I've come straight to you--," [...] without being able to finish his phrase, that the great pitifulness of that lonely and tormented death in Costaguana came to her with the full force of its misery. He caught hold of <b>her</b> <b>hand,</b> <b>raised</b> it to his lips, and at that she dropped her parasol to pat him on the cheek, murmured [...] "Poor boy," [...] and began to dry her eyes under the downward curve of her hat-brim, very small in her simple, white frock, almost like a lost child crying in the degraded grandeur of the noble hall, while he stood by her, again perfectly motionless in the contemplation of the marble urn.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Gould {{loved the}} patio of her Spanish house. A broad flight of stone steps was {{overlooked}} silently from {{a niche in}} the wall by a Madonna in blue robes with the crowned child sitting on her arm. Subdued voices ascended in the early mornings from the paved well of the quadrangle, with the stamping of horses and mules led out in pairs to drink at the cistern. A tangle of slender bamboo stems drooped its narrow, blade-like leaves over the square pool of water, and the fat coachman sat muffled up on the edge, holding lazily the ends of halters in his hand. Barefooted servants passed to and fro, issuing from dark, low doorways below; two laundry girls with baskets of washed linen; the baker with the tray of bread made for the day; Leonarda--her own camerista--bearing high up, swung from <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>raised</b> above her raven black head, a bunch of starched under-skirts dazzlingly white in the slant of sunshine. Then the old porter would hobble in, sweeping the flagstones, {{and the house was}} ready for the day. All the lofty rooms on three sides of the quadrangle opened into each other and into the corredor, with its wrought-iron railings and a border of flowers, whence, like the lady of the mediaeval castle, she could witness from above all the departures and arrivals of the Casa, to which the sonorous arched gateway lent an air of stately importance.|$|E
5000|$|Mary Magdalen (in {{the chapel}} of the Crucifix, second left altar): {{in a large}} mantle, <b>her</b> right <b>hand</b> <b>raised</b> towards the right eye wiping her tears.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear me! dear me!" [...] he whispered, with {{affected}} gallantry, [...] "this {{is indeed}} a charming surprise," [...] and Marguerite felt <b>her</b> resistless <b>hand</b> <b>raised</b> to Chauvelin's thin, mocking lips.|$|R
6000|$|... "Arise," [...] she said, [...] "it is I {{who should}} kneel to thee," [...] and she {{stretched}} out <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> to <b>raise</b> him, whispering {{in his ear}} the while.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Cambridge crew at {{the start}} (cox Dowbiggin has <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>raised</b> to {{indicate}} she and her crew {{are not ready to}} start) ...|$|E
5000|$|MSPs are {{required}} {{to swear an oath}} of allegiance to the Queen before they can take their seat in Parliament. As the Scottish Socialist Party is a republican party, their MSPs held various protests during the oath ceremony, during which Kane took her oath with <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>raised</b> which had the words [...] "My oath is to the people" [...] written on it.|$|E
5000|$|Cambridge won {{the coin}} toss and elected {{to start from}} the {{northern}} bank (the [...] "Middlesex side") of the Thames. [...] Despite Cambridge's cox Griggs having <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> <b>raised</b> (to indicate that she and the Cambridge crew were {{not yet ready to}} commence), race umpire Simon Harris started the race. [...] With a stroke rate of 51, Oxford took an early lead, but Cambridge pulled level as the crews passed Craven Cottage. Taking a slight lead round the Surrey bend, Cambridge's number four, Mayer suffered an asthma attack and collapsed, allowing Oxford to draw up to within a second as they approached Barnes Bridge. In a sprint finish, Oxford pulled away to be three-quarters of a length clear at the finishing post.|$|E
25|$|Her tomb {{was created}} by Pietro Torrigiano, who {{probably}} arrived in England in 1509 and received the commission in the following year. The gilded bronze sculpture on the tomb depicts Margaret with her head resting on pillows and <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>raised</b> in prayer, wearing garments characteristic of widowhood; the face was probably sculpted from a death mask. The black marble tomb is embellished with heraldic bronze insignia, including a yale, her heraldic badge, at her feet.|$|R
60|$|He {{moved his}} chair {{deliberately}} a little nearer, took <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and <b>raised</b> {{it to his}} lips. Her face was perilously near to his. She drew a little back--and too abruptly.|$|R
2500|$|The Eastern Orthodox {{portrayal}} of the Ascension is a major metaphor for the mystical nature of the Church. In many Eastern icons the Virgin Mary is placed {{at the center of}} the scene in the earthly part of the depiction, with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>raised</b> towards Heaven, often accompanied by various Apostles. The upwards-looking depiction of the earthly group matches the Eastern liturgy on the Feast of the Ascension: [...] "Come, let us rise and turn our eyes and thoughts high..." ...|$|R
60|$|Prostrated by mental exertion, Mrs. Wragge was {{pursuing}} {{the course of}} the omelette in dreams. Her head was twisted one way, and her body the other. She snored meekly. At intervals one of <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>raised</b> itself in the air, shook an imaginary frying-pan, and dropped again with a faint thump on the cookery-book in her lap. At the sound of her husband's voice, she started to her feet, and confronted him with her mind fast asleep, and her eyes wide open.|$|R
5000|$|The first photo shows The Beatles {{facing a}} woman who stands {{with her back to}} the camera, <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>raised</b> as if in {{surprise}} (or worship) while The Beatles hold a string of sausages. This was meant to represent the 'birth' of the Beatles, with the sausages serving as an umbilical cord. Whitaker explained: [...] "My own thought was how the hell do you show that they've been born out of a woman the same as anybody else? An umbilical cord was one way of doing it." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{held out}} both <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> and <b>raised</b> <b>her</b> eyes to mine. Through the filmy lace of her veil I {{could see that}} they were very soft, almost as though tears were {{gathering}} there.|$|R
60|$|Her request being granted, she kneeled on {{the rocky}} ground, clasped <b>her</b> <b>hands,</b> and <b>raised</b> to Heaven a look of calm trustfulness, as she held communion {{for the last time}} on earth with her Redeemer.|$|R
60|$|The girl, with <b>her</b> <b>hands</b> <b>raised</b> before <b>her</b> pale eyes, was {{threading}} her needle. He {{glanced at}} her, and his mighty trunk overshadowed the table, bringing nearer {{to us the}} breadth of his shoulders, the thickness of his neck, and that incongruous, anchorite head, burnt in the desert, hollowed and lean as if by excesses of vigils and fasting. His beard flowed imposingly downwards, out of sight, between the two brown hands gripping {{the edge of the}} table, and his persistent glance made sombre by the wide dilations of the pupils, fascinated.|$|R
60|$|There was {{a slight}} dimple of {{mischief}} in her cheek, and a quaint sparkle in her dark eye, as she turned her questioning gaze on Arthur. He caught <b>her</b> <b>hand</b> and <b>raised</b> it respectfully to his lips.|$|R
