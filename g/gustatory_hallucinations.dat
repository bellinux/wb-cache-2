5|$|Schizophrenia {{is often}} {{described}} in terms of positive and negative (or deficit) symptoms. Positive symptoms are those that most individuals do not normally experience, but are present in people with schizophrenia. They can include delusions, disordered thoughts and speech, and tactile, auditory, visual, olfactory and <b>gustatory</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> typically regarded as manifestations of psychosis. Hallucinations are also typically related to the content of the delusional theme. Positive symptoms generally respond well to medication.|$|E

50|$|Many of the {{symptoms}} associated with this area involve the head and digestive tract: swallowing, salivation, mastication and possibly <b>gustatory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> Preceding the seizure the person is fearful and often has an epigastric aura. There is not much physical movement except clonic facial movements. Speech is often arrested.|$|E
25|$|This type of {{hallucination}} is {{the perception}} of taste without a stimulus. These hallucinations, which are typically strange or unpleasant, are relatively common among individuals who have certain types of focal epilepsy, especially temporal lobe epilepsy. The regions of the brain responsible for <b>gustatory</b> <b>hallucination</b> in this case are the insula and the superior bank of the sylvian fissure.|$|R

25|$|One {{study from}} {{as early as}} 1895 {{reported}} that approximately 10% of the population experiences hallucinations. A 1996-1999 survey of over 13,000 people reported a much higher figure, with almost 39% of people reporting hallucinatory experiences, 27% of which daytime hallucinations, mostly outside the context of illness or drug use. From this survey, olfactory (smell) and <b>gustatory</b> (taste) <b>hallucinations</b> seem the most common in the general population.|$|R

50|$|Interneurons in the {{external}} plexiform layer are responsive to pre-synaptic action potentials and exhibit both excitatory postsynaptic potentials and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. Neural firing varies temporally, there are periods of fast, spontaneous firing and slow modulation of firing. These patterns {{may be related to}} sniffing or change in intensity and concentration of odorant. Temporal patterns may have effect in later processing of spatial awareness of odorant. For example, synchronized mitral cell spike trains appear to help to discriminate similar odors better than when those spike trains are not synchronized. Destruction to the olfactory bulb results in ipsilateral anosmia while irritative lesion of the uncus can result in olfactory and <b>gustatory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A person {{experiencing}} a TEA episode {{has very little}} short-term memory, {{so that there is}} profound difficulty remembering events in the past few minutes (anterograde amnesia), or of events in the hours prior to the onset of the attack, and even memories of important events in recent years may not be accessible during the amnestic event (retrograde amnesia). Some people report short-lived retrograde amnesia so deep that they do not recognize their home or family members, though personal identity is preserved. The amnestic attack has a sudden onset. Three-fourths of cases are reported upon awakening. In attacks that begin when an individual is fully alert, olfactory hallucinations or a [...] "strange taste" [...] or nausea have been reported. Somewhat less than half the cases include olfactory or <b>gustatory</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> and slightly more than a third involve motor automatisms. A quarter of attacks involve a brief period of unresponsiveness. Frequently, however, there is no warning.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: To {{determine}} whether specific temporal lobe simple partial seizures (SPSs) {{are associated with}} an abnormal amygdala T- 2 (AT(2)) ipsilateral to the seizure focus in patients with intractable unilateral temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). AT(2) relaxation time mapping is a sensitive method {{for the detection of}} abnormal tissue in the amygdala in patients with refractory TLE. The relation between an abnormal AT(2) in the epileptic temporal lobe and amygdala seizure onset has not been established. Methods: Fifty patients with intractable unilateral TLE and concordant data during presurgical evaluation were included. Patients with a foreign-tissue lesion on standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were excluded. All had AT(2) mapping. Fifteen types of SPSs were ascertained prospectively, systematically, and blinded to the results of AT(2) mapping. The SPSs of patients with a normal AT(2) (n = 25) were compared with those of patients with an abnormal AT(2) ipsilateral to the seizure focus (n = 25). Results: The group of patients with an abnormal AT(2) reported a median of six types of SPSs (range 1 - 11), in comparison with a median of three types of SPSs (range, 0 - 7) for the group with a normal AT(2) (p < 0. 01). Deja vu, a warm sensation, an indescribable strange sensation, a cephalic sensation, and fear were associated with an abnormal AT(2). The combination of deja vu, a cephalic sensation, a warm sensation, a <b>gustatory</b> <b>hallucination,</b> and an indescribable strange sensation discriminated best, between the 25 patients with a normal and the 25 patients with an abnormal AT(2.) Conclusions: A high number and the types of different SPSs provide clinical evidence for early involvement of the amygdala during seizures in patients with refractory unilateral TLE and an abnormal AT(2) in the epileptic temporal lobe...|$|R
50|$|Hallucinations {{can occur}} {{in any of the}} five senses, {{although}} auditory and visual hallucinations are encountered more frequently than tactile (touch), olfactory (smell) or <b>gustatory</b> (taste) hallucinations.Auditory <b>hallucinations</b> are typical of psychoses: third-person hallucinations (i.e. voices talking about the patient) and hearing one's thoughts spoken aloud (gedankenlautwerden or écho de la pensée) are among the Schneiderian first rank symptoms indicative of schizophrenia, whereas second-person hallucinations (voices talking to the patient) threatening or insulting or telling them to commit suicide, may be a feature of psychotic depression or schizophrenia. Visual hallucinations are generally suggestive of organic conditions such as epilepsy, drug intoxication or drug withdrawal. Many of the visual effects of hallucinogenic drugs are more correctly described as visual illusions or visual pseudohallucinations, as they are distortions of sensory experiences, and are not experienced as existing in objective reality. Auditory pseudohallucinations are suggestive of dissociative disorders. Déjà vu, derealization and depersonalization are associated with temporal lobe epilepsy and dissociative disorders.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE—This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} prevalence of hallucinations and delusions in Parkinson's disease, to describe such symptoms phenomenologically, and possibly to determine factors associated with their development. In addition, {{the role of the}} visual system in relation to visual hallucinations was examined.  METHOD— 102 consecutive patients diagnosed with strictly defined Parkinson's disease were examined for the presence of hallucinations and delusions and assessed for visual acuity, cognition, depression using the geriatric depression scale, disease severity as measured by the UPDRS, and other clinical variables.  RESULTS—Of 102 consecutive patients, 29. 4 % (n= 30) had hallucinations or delusions, four (3. 9 %) were determined to be psychotic due solely to delirium and were excluded from further analysis. Of the 98 remaining patients, 26. 5 % (n= 26) had visual hallucinations. Among these, one patient also had delusions, two had auditory hallucinations, and one had <b>gustatory</b> <b>hallucinations.</b> Visual hallucinations were significantly associated with worse visual acuity, lower cognitive score, higher depression score, and worse disease severity. Hallucinations were not associated with history of psychiatric disease, dose or duration of levodopa or other antiparkinsonian medication treatment, or duration of illness.  CONCLUSIONS—Visual hallucinations are common symptoms in Parkinson's disease and are most likely of multifactorial origin. Although higher doses of levodopa are known to be related clinically to hallucinations in individual patients, the results suggest that several underlying characteristics of patients with Parkinson's disease (disease severity, dementia, depression, worse visual acuity) may be more important determinants of which patients experience hallucinations. The data also provide preliminary evidence that abnormality of the visual system may be related to visual hallucinations in Parkinson's disease, as has been found in other disorders with visual hallucinations. ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mesial {{temporal}} lobe epilepsy (TLE) is a remediable epileptic syndrome. About 40 % of patients {{continue to have}} seizures after standard {{temporal lobe}}ctomy. It {{has been suggested that}} some of these patients could actually suffer from a more complex epileptogenic network. Because a few papers have been dedicated to this topic, we decided to write an article updating this theme. Methods: We performed a literature search using the following terminology: “temporal plus epilepsy and networks,” “temporal plus epilepsy,” “orbito-temporal epilepsy,” “temporo-insular epilepsy,” “temporo-parieto-occipital (TPO) epilepsy,” “parieto-temporal epilepsy,” “intracortical evoked potential and temporal plus epilepsy,” “temporal lobe connectivity and epilepsy,” “intracortical evoked potential and epilepsy surgery,” “role of extratemporal structures in TLE,” “surgical failure after temporal lobectomy,” “Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and temporal epilepsy,” and “positron emission tomography (PET) in temporal plus lobe epilepsy” in the existing PubMed databases. We searched only English and Spanish literature. Only papers that fit with the above-mentioned descriptors were included as part of the evidence. Other articles were used to reference some aspects of the temporal plus epilepsy. Results: A total of 48 papers from 2334 were revised. The most frequently reported auras in these groups of patients are <b>gustatory</b> <b>hallucinations,</b> vestibular illusions, laryngeal and throat constriction, atypical distribution of somatosensory symptoms (perioral and hands, bilaterally hands paresthesias, trunk and other). The most common signs are tonic posturing, hemifacial twist, and frequent bilateral clonic movements. Interictal electroencephalographic (EEG) patterns exhibit regional and frequently bilateral spikes and/or slow waves. The first ictal electrographic change is mostly regional. It {{is important to note that}} the evidence is supported by case series or case reports. Thus, most of the data presented could represent the features on these cases and not actually the totality of the iceberg. Conclusion: Temporal plus epilepsy is a diagnosis that can be done only after the invasive recordings have been analyzed but an adequate suspicion may arise based on clinical, EEG and imaging data. </p...|$|E
40|$|Temporal 'plus' epilepsies are {{characterized}} by seizures involving a complex epileptogenic network including the temporal lobe and the closed neighboured structures such as the orbito-frontal cortex, the insula, the frontal and parietal operculum and the temporo-parieto-occipital junction. Temporal 'plus' epilepsies are currently identified by means of intracerebral electrodes but whether their diagnosis can be suspected non-invasively has not been evaluated yet. The aim of this retrospective study was {{to address this issue}} in 80 consecutive patients who were thought to suffer from non-lesional temporal lobe seizures which finally proved, on the basis of stereotactic intracerebral EEG (SEEG) recordings, to be 'purely' temporal (TL group, n = 58) or temporal 'plus' (T+ group, n = 22). Our results showed that the two groups of patients were difficult to differentiate on the basis of general clinical features or MRI data. Even the presence of hippocampal sclerosis did not distinguish the two groups. Conversely, both ictal clinical symptoms and scalp-EEG findings significantly differentiated TL from T+ patients. Patients with TL epilepsies more frequently presented an ability to warn at seizure onset (P = 0. 003), an abdominal aura (P = 0. 05), gestural automatisms (P = 0. 04) and a post-ictal amnesia (P = 0. 02). Patients suffering from T+ epilepsies more frequently had <b>gustatory</b> <b>hallucinations</b> (P = 0. 02), rotatory vertigo (P = 0. 02) and auditory illusions (P = 0. 02) at seizure onset; they exhibited more frequently contraversive manifestations of the eyes and/or head (P = 0. 001), piloerection (P = 0. 03) and ipsilateral tonic motor signs (P = 0. 05), and they were more often dysphoric in the post-ictal phase (P = 0. 0001). Cluster analysis mainly indicated that some associations of symptoms were relevant for differentiating TL cases from T+ cases. Interictal EEG of T+ patients more frequently exhibited bilateral or precentral abnormalities, while ictal EEG more frequently pointed over the anterior frontal, temporo-parietal and precentral regions. Neither TL interictal spikes, nor TL ictal EEG onset, allowed us definitely to rule out the possibility of T+ epilepsies. Our findings may be useful for identifying, among patients suffering from 'atypical' non-lesional TL epilepsies, those who should undergo invasive recordings before surgery...|$|E
