In November 2011, Middlebrooks, Che-Hsuan Lin and Drake Britton were added to the Red Sox 40-man roster to prevent them from being selected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> 5 draft.|$|E

5|$|The Mets added deGrom {{to their}} 40-man roster on November 20, 2013, {{to protect him}} from being {{eligible}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> 5 draft. During the offseason, deGrom improved his mechanics, and learned to throw a curveball. He began the 2014 season with Las Vegas, and had a 4–0 win–loss record and a 2.58 ERA in his first seven games started.|$|E

5|$|A 6'3, 180lb. {{player from}} Richmond, California, he played minor league {{baseball}} in the New York Yankees organization before being acquired by the Athletics <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> 5 draft. Christopher joined the Athletics' major league roster in 1942 and played six seasons for them, and made his only All-Star appearance in 1945. He {{was traded to the}} Indians before the 1948 season, and played one year of baseball with them. After the season ended, he retired due to health concerns and worked at an aircraft plant until his death in 1954.|$|E
5|$|A two-sport star in high school, Hansen rose {{quickly through}} the Giants' minor league system and made his major league debut at age 19. He played for the Giants until 1946, when he voluntarily retired due to a family illness and then served in the United States Army. He {{returned}} to baseball in 1947 and earned a career-best five wins in 1948. After a contract holdout in 1949, Hansen's bullpen workload increased in 1950, leading to an elbow injury and the Giants sending him to the Phillies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> 5 draft.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} from military service, Linde joined the Greenville Spinners, the Chicago White Sox minor league affiliate of the Sally League. He tried {{out for the}} Milwaukee Brewers, {{but was unable to}} make the team, and as a result was sent to Greenville to gain experience. Linde pitched in 29 games for the Spinners. In those 29 games, he had ten wins, eight losses, a 3.50 ERA, and 121 innings pitched. After the conclusion of the season, in early November, Linde was drafted by the Cleveland Indians <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> 5 draft.|$|E

5|$|In his lone {{season with}} the Bears, Christopher pitched in 31 games. Among those games was a four-hit shutout against the Rochester Red Wings in the International League playoffs to put the Bears up two games to none. In the {{championship}} series against the Montreal Royals, Christopher pitched seven solid innings in {{a victory for the}} Bears, but injured his back and did not play another game that season. He finished the season with a 16–7 record, a 2.82 ERA and 12 complete games. At the conclusion of the season, Christopher was considered the top prospect <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> 5 draft, and the Philadelphia Athletics selected him with the first pick of the draft.|$|E
5|$|In the 4th century, the Roman army {{underwent}} a radical restructuring. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> of Diocletian (284–305), the traditional Principate formations of legiones, alae and cohortes {{appear to have}} been broken up into smaller units, many of which bore a variety of new names. Under Constantine I (r. 312–337) it appears that military units were classified into three grades based on strategic role and to some extent quality: palatini, elite units normally part of the exercitus praesentales (imperial escort armies); comitatenses, higher-grade interception forces based in frontier provinces; and limitanei, lower-grade border troops. (See Late Roman army).|$|E
5|$|Nova {{grew up poor}} in the Dominican Republic, {{where he}} started playing {{baseball}} at a young age. An unheralded prospect, the Yankees signed Nova as an international free agent in 2004. After pitching in minor league baseball through the 2008 season, the San Diego Padres selected Nova from the Yankees <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> 5 draft. The Padres opted not to carry Nova on their 25-man roster, however, and returned him to the Yankees.|$|E

Upon the ruler's death in 1714 at the age of 41, his son, Dodda Krishnaraja I, still two weeks shy of his 12th birthday, succeeded him.|$|E
5|$|Any {{one-dimensional}} reversible {{cellular automaton}} may be placed into rectangular form, after which its transition rule may be factored into {{the action of}} an idempotent semicentral bigroupoid (a reversible rule for which regions of cells with a single state value change only at their boundaries) together with a permutation {{on the set of}} states. The first-order invariants for the idempotent lifting of the automaton rule (the modified rule formed by omitting the permutation) necessarily behave like the ones for a rectangular band: they have a basis of invariants that flow either leftwards or rightwards at a constant rate without interaction. The first-order invariants for the overall automaton are then exactly the invariants for the idempotent lifting that give equal weight to every pair of states that belong to the same orbit of the permutation. However, the permutation of states <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> may cause these invariants to behave differently from in the idempotent lifting, flowing non-uniformly and with interactions.|$|E
5|$|López {{attended}} the University of Virginia, earning {{a degree in}} psychology despite leaving early to begin his baseball career. He was selected by the Arizona Diamondbacks in the fourth round of the 1998 Major League Baseball draft. He {{began his career as}} a starting pitcher but struggled, and was converted into a sidearm (or submarine) reliever while still in the Diamondbacks' organization. Before the 2003 season, he was selected by the Boston Red Sox <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> 5 draft, but was traded to the Colorado Rockies during spring training. He spent all of 2003 on Colorado's roster, nearly tying the franchise record for most consecutive batters retired and finishing third among major league rookies in games pitched. He struggled the next two seasons, getting claimed off waivers and later sent to the minors by Arizona in 2005. In 2006, he signed with the Chicago White Sox but failed to make the team and spent the first part of the season in the minors before getting traded to Boston during the year.|$|E

5|$|Mota was {{originally}} {{signed by the}} New York Mets in 1990 as an infielder. After several years in their organization, he was drafted by the Montreal Expos <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> 5 draft in 1996 and converted into a pitcher in 1997. Mota had a 2.96 ERA in 1999, his rookie season, but he struggled in his next two seasons and {{was traded to the}} Los Angeles Dodgers prior to 2002. His struggles continued in his first year with the Dodgers, but Mota had a career year in 2003, as he had a 6–3 record with a 1.97 ERA in 76 games. He became the setup man to closer Éric Gagné in 2004, but was traded to the Florida Marlins midseason. Mota started 2005 as their closer, but Todd Jones took over the role when Mota got hurt in April. Following the year, Mota was traded to the Boston Red Sox.|$|E
5|$|The Dodgers in the 1958 season {{posted a}} 71–83 win-loss record, {{finished}} in seventh place (out of eight teams) in the NL, and never held the league lead. By contrast the Braves won the NL that {{year with a}} 92–62 record and advanced to the 1958 World Series where the New York Yankees defeated them in seven games. Despite their success the Braves made several changes leading into the 1959 season. First, they selected Jim Pisoni <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> 5 draft from the Yankees in December 1958, although {{he returned to the}} Yankees by May 1959. The Braves then traded with the Philadelphia Phillies for Ted Kazanski, Stan Lopata, and Johnny O'Brien just prior to the season. Finally, the Braves traded for Mickey Vernon from the Cleveland Indians and selected Bobby Ávila, Ray Boone, and Enos Slaughter off of waivers during the 1959 season. The Dodgers traded for Rip Repulski and Wally Moon during the offseason and then acquired Chuck Churn, Solly Drake, and Chuck Essegian during the year.|$|E

25|$|In the Roman Liturgy {{the office}} of Nones is {{likewise}} constructed after {{the model of the}} Little Hours of the day; it is composed of the same elements as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> of St. Benedict, with this difference: that instead of the three psalms (125-127), the three groups of eight verses from Psalm 118 are always recited. There is nothing else characteristic of this office in this liturgy. The hymn, which was added later, is the one already in use in the Benedictine Office—Rerum Deus tenax vigor. In the monastic rules prior to the 10th century certain variations are found. Thus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Rule</b> of Lerins, as in that of St. Caesarius, six psalms are recited at Nones, as at Terce and Sext, with antiphon, hymn and capitulum.|$|E
