5|$|After the war, the {{military}} service of Hawaiians, including James Wood Bush and many others, was largely forgotten, disappearing from the collective {{memories of the}} American Civil War {{and the history of}} Hawaii. However, in recent years, Hawaiian residents, historians, and descendants of Hawaiian combatants in the conflict <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> on the need to remember the legacy of the Hawaiians who fought. Renewed interest in the stories of these individuals and this particular period of Hawaiian-American history have inspired efforts to preserve the memories of the Hawaiians who served in the war.|$|E
5|$|For its {{coverage}} of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict, some (such as Ed Koch) have claimed that the paper is pro-Palestinian, while others (such as As`ad AbuKhalil) <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> that it is pro-Israel. The Israel Lobby and U.S. Foreign Policy, by political science professors John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, alleges that The New York Times sometimes criticizes Israeli policies but is not even-handed and is generally pro-Israel. On the other hand, the Simon Wiesenthal Center has criticized The New York Times for printing cartoons regarding the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that were claimed to be anti-Semitic.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1130s England began to descend into {{a period of}} civil war known as the Anarchy, during which the {{supporters}} of King Stephen fought {{with those of the}} Empress Matilda for control of the kingdom. William de Mohun's eldest son, also called William, was a noted supporter of Matilda, and Dunster was considered one of her faction's strongest castles in the south-west. In 1138 forces loyal to Stephen besieged the castle; a siege castle was built nearby, but all trace of it has been lost. William successfully held the castle and was made the Earl of Somerset by the grateful Empress. Chroniclers subsequently complained {{of the way in which}} he subsequently raided and controlled the region by force during the war, causing much destruction. In the aftermath of the conflict, William's son, another William, inherited the castle after a short period of royal ownership under Henry II. William appears to <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> that his tenants agree to help repair and maintain the castle walls as part of their feudal service.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, {{under the}} Davis–Strong Act, the state {{legislature}} established the Alabama Indian Affairs Commission. Native American groups within the state had increasingly been demanding recognition as ethnic groups and seeking an end to discrimination. Given {{the long history of}} slavery and associated racial segregation, the Native American peoples, who have sometimes been of mixed race, <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> on having their cultural identification respected. In the past, their self-identification was often overlooked as the state tried to impose a binary breakdown of society into white and black.|$|E
25|$|The attack {{provoked}} {{shock and}} unease in Taiwan, where political violence {{of this kind}} was commonplace against non-KMT members 40 years earlier. Reaction to the incident divided along partisan lines, with some pan-Blue supporters believing the incident was faked {{in order to win}} the sympathy of voters in the upcoming election, which Chen and Lu won by 29,500 votes. In August 2005, the case was officially closed with all evidence pointing to a single deceased suspect, Chen Yi-hsiung, but Chen's opponents as well as Annette Lu <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> on the continuation of the investigation.|$|E

25|$|In the 2000 presidential elections, PAN {{candidate}} (and eventual winner) Vicente Fox used homosexual stereotypes to demean and humiliate {{his principal}} opponent (Francisco Labastida). Fox accused Labastida {{of being a}} sissy and a mama's boy and nicknamed him Lavestida ("the cross-dressed"). When Mexico City and Coahuila legalized same-sex civil unions the chief opposition came from the PAN, former President Vicente Fox and former President Felipe Calderón. Since then the party has opposed similar bills, with the rationale of protecting traditional family values. Nonetheless, PAN officials <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> that homosexuals have rights as human beings and should in no case be subjected to hatred or physical violence.|$|E
25|$|For {{certain of}} the novel's {{prominent}} features, Prus, the conscientious journalist and scholar, seems to <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> on having two sources, one of them based on personal or at least contemporary experience. One such dually-determined feature relates to Egyptian beliefs about an afterlife. In 1893, the year before beginning his novel, Prus the skeptic had started taking an intense interest in Spiritualism, attending Warsaw séances which featured the Italian medium, Eusapia Palladino—the same medium whose Paris séances, a dozen years later, would be attended by Pierre and Marie Curie. Palladino {{had been brought to}} Warsaw from a St. Petersburg mediumistic tour by Prus' friend Ochorowicz.|$|E
25|$|Several {{decades ago}} deeply buried rock strata {{of the type}} {{associated}} with oil deposits {{have been found in}} the Lacandon area in both Mexico and Guatemala. There has been some exploration and pumping in the area, but it seems likely that there is far more. Some of these rock formations are in Zapatista held areas of the forest, but many geologists and the Mexican government <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> there is little promise of oil in these areas. There is some contradicting data. The Zapatistas claim that the government is hiding the presence of oil in the area as they try to force them and the indigenous people who support them off the lands.|$|E

25|$|It {{is certain}} that John Paul I would not have {{reversed}} Paul VI's teaching, namely on contraception, {{since it was a}} question of sexual ethics and Church doctrine, rather than one of personal opinion. Nevertheless, it is reasonable to assume that John Paul I would not <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> upon the negative judgment in Humanae vitae as aggressively and publicly as John Paul II did. Luciani had mixed feelings in regards to the traditional stance on contraception. In 1968, as Bishop of Vittorio Veneto, he submitted a report to his predecessor as the Patriarch of Venice, Giovanni Urbani, that argued that the contraceptive pill should be permitted. It was agreed on by fellow Veneto bishops and was later submitted to Pope Paul VI. When Humanae vitae was released, Luciani defended that document. But he seemed to contradict that defence in a letter he wrote to his diocese four days after the release of the encyclical. In May 1978, Cardinal Luciani was invited to speak at a Milanese conference to celebrate the 10th anniversary of the encyclical. He refused to speak at the event or even attend it.|$|E
25|$|By 2012, the Cázares {{claimed the}} Tamaulipas agency had not {{questioned}} potential suspects or eyewitnesses of the kidnapping, nor had they visited the locations {{relevant to the}} case. The Cázares <b>have</b> <b>insisted</b> that authorities should start by investigating the house they were taken following their kidnapping, given that it is located just {{a block away from}} a busy street in Matamoros. In March 2012, an electricity bill was found {{on the door of the}} premises. The bill showed that the service was used exponentially during the month the family was kidnapped, and that the last time someone paid the bill was on January 2011. A neighbor who lived near the house where the Cázares were held hostage said he did not know who the owners of the property were but did acknowledge seeing suspicious activity during the evenings. On March 7, about 10 months after the mass kidnapping, Gérald Martin, the General Consul of France in Mexico, told the Cázares family that a squadron of Mexico's Federal Police had been dispatched to Matamoros to work directly on the case. The family claims, however, that were not sure if the investigation was actually carried out. They said they did not receive any documents of the investigation. By October 2012, a criminal court in Jalisco under judge Francisco Martín Hernández Zaragoza was assigned to investigate the case. The family claims they do not know the details of the investigation.|$|E
