5|$|The 'front' (south-east) face of {{the tower}} has a Gothic-arched <b>entrance</b> <b>door,</b> a statue of King Alfred, and a stone panel bearing an {{inscription}} (see below). This is the face that most visitors see first when walking from Stourhead garden or from the nearby car park.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} of the observatory building has a brick cornice, with stone sills and lintels, stone water course, ornamental gutters, and original copper downspouts. Most of the building's windows are of the wooden double-hung variety and original, as are the front <b>entrance</b> <b>door</b> transom and concrete stoop. The original front balustrade has been replaced, however, the western stoop and ornamental iron balustrade is still original.|$|E
5|$|There {{were two}} {{rooms on the}} first floor, which were damaged in the fire of 1884, which also has a small <b>entrance</b> <b>door</b> which was {{accessed}} via exterior stone steps which no longer exist. There was also a latrine in a turret which no longer exists. There are small traceried arched windows.|$|E

5|$|Each of {{the main}} façade's first- and second-story windows and the {{entrance}} are adorned with white wooden label moldings. The main entrance is composed of a tall double wooden <b>entrance</b> <b>door,</b> with its original handle and locks. Each door consists of four vertical wooden panels. A rectangular transom light of four vertical glass panels tops the main entryway's double wooden doors. Outside the entryway is a spacious brick stoop that is accessed by a cement walkway from West Main Street. Its brick steps {{leading up to the}} stoop were last restored in the late 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The north-west corner {{tower is}} 14 feet by 10 feet 6 inches (4.3 by 3.20 m) across on the inside, with an <b>entrance</b> <b>door</b> {{on the east}} side, and {{originally}} had a loft floor. It remains uncertain {{if there was a}} second corner tower built in the south-east corner of the castle complex; excavations in 1978 in one possible location failed to find any traces, and a geophysical survey in 1998 proved inconclusive.|$|E
5|$|The Puerta de Palmas {{was built}} in 1551. It has two {{cylindrical}} towers flanking the <b>entrance</b> <b>door.</b> Prince Philip II and Emperor Charles V and date of construction are mentioned on the outer side of the tower. The towers are fortified with battlements and they have two decorative cords {{at the top and}} bottom levels. Its entrance is east-facing, and is double-arched and is decorated with medallions of the shield of the Emperor Charles V. It was once used as a prison, but has since undergone many renovations and has been an entrance point to the city.|$|E

5|$|A five-man crew, {{the first}} pilot, co-pilot, {{navigator}} radar, navigator plotter and air electronics officer (AEO) was accommodated within the pressure cabin on two levels; the pilots sitting on Martin-Baker 3K (3KS on the B.2) ejection seats whilst {{on the lower}} level, the other crew sat facing rearwards and would abandon the aircraft via the <b>entrance</b> <b>door.</b> The original B35/46 specification sought a jettisonable crew compartment, this requirement was removed in a subsequent amendment, the rear crew's escape system was often an issue of controversy, such as when a practical refit scheme was rejected. A rudimentary sixth seat forward of the navigator radar was provided for an additional crew member; the B.2 had an additional seventh seat opposite the sixth seat and forward of the AEO. These seats {{were no more than}} cushions, a full harness and an oxygen and intercom facility. The visual bomb-aimer's compartment could be fitted with a T4 (Blue Devil) bombsight, in many B.2s this space housed a vertically mounted Vinten F95 Mk.10 camera for assessing simulated low-level bombing runs.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} centres on the double-height entrance hall, {{with the}} theme of Time. The painted ceiling depicts the astrological signs of the constellations, arranged in the positions they held when the house was first occupied. A large stained glass window contains four female figures representing Dawn, Noon, Twilight and Night. A mosaic floor in the entrance hall contains a labyrinth design, with the centre depicting the myth of Theseus slaying the Minotaur. The garden's <b>entrance</b> <b>door,</b> also covered in bronze, is decorated with a relief of the Madonna and Child. As elsewhere, Burges incorporated earlier designs, the bronze doors echoing those at Cork Cathedral, and the maze floor recalling an earlier ceiling at Burges's office at 15 Buckingham Street. Emblems adorn the five doors on the ground floor, each one relevant to their respective room. A flower marked {{the door to the}} garden, with the front door marked by a key. The library is indicated by an open book, the drawing or music room by musical instruments, and the dining room by a bowl and flask of wine.|$|E

25|$|Frequently touched {{surfaces}} typically manufactured {{with standard}} materials (i.e., plastic, chrome, aluminum) were replaced with copper alloys. These included a copper alloy set of sink tap handles (60% Cu, 40% Zn) and a ward <b>entrance</b> <b>door</b> push plate (70% Cu, 30% Zn).|$|E
25|$|This safety-glass {{display is}} behind the <b>entrance</b> <b>door,</b> and set low enough for young {{children}} {{to see some of}} the mounted birds at eye-level.

25|$|This Revelation {{is often}} depicted, {{with or without}} the Judgement and the rewards of Heaven and terrors of Hell, above the lintel of the main <b>entrance</b> <b>door.</b> In {{countries}} where stone-carving prevails as an art, it is externally placed. In countries where murals are more common, the Last Judgement occupies the internal wall above the main door.|$|E

25|$|During {{the time}} when the last Idstein prince, Georg August Samuel von Nassau-Idstein (1665–1721), was ruling, the {{building}} was given its interior design under Maximilian von Welsch's guidance. The now partly missing ceiling stucco was done by Carlo Maria Pozzi. At the main <b>entrance</b> <b>door</b> is a great alliance coat of arms of Count Johann and his consort from about 1635.|$|E
25|$|These Orlit {{structures}} were {{split into two}} sections. The <b>entrance</b> <b>door</b> led into the smaller roofed section which {{was used as a}} shelter and store with a sliding door into the open section which housed the post instrument and chart on top of a wooden mounting. Two types of Orlit posts existed, the Orlit ‘A’ was at ground level and the Orlit ‘B’ was raised 6ft on four legs with a ladder for access.|$|E
25|$|In 1571, {{during the}} Sengoku period, in the Siege of Mount Hiei, the daimyō Oda Nobunaga, decided to {{challenge}} {{the power of the}} warrior monks of the Tendai sect, and destroyed the sect's headquarters at Enryaku-ji on Mount Hiei, above Kyoto. Soon after, a samurai in the service of Nobunaga, Gorōzaemon, burns Saimyō-ji; Only the main building, the three-storey pagoda and the wooden <b>entrance</b> <b>door</b> to the temple escaped the ravages of the fire.|$|E

25|$|Above {{the door}} of these {{quarters}} is a stone with the initials of Patrick Houston of Drummaston and his wife Margaret Gordon, together with the likely date of construction, 1674. This stone has been moved from the old <b>entrance</b> <b>door</b> of the main building. The angle turrets {{on the second floor}} are carried on three plain corbels and do not show at all in the inside of the building. A Gothic-style porch was once attached to the Drumelan burn side of the castle.|$|E
25|$|The new {{fuselage}} section is constructed {{as a single}} large component, including the vertical stabilizer. When attached to the existing nose section, the fuselage is 55 feet (16.8 m) long and 9 feet (2.74 m) diameter. The fuselage has upper and lower halves, each with a roughly-oval shape similar to a canoe. The halves are bonded to circular frames. The {{fuselage section}} ahead of the <b>entrance</b> <b>door</b> consists of the existing (metal) 328J component, with fasteners used to bring the forward and new aft sections together.|$|E
25|$|On {{the islands}} of Orkney and Shetland {{there are very few}} cells at ground floor. Most brochs have scarcements (ledges) which may have allowed the {{construction}} of a very sturdy wooden first floor (first spotted by the antiquary George Low in Shetland in 1774), and excavations at Loch na Berie on the Isle of Lewis show signs of a further, second floor (e.g. stairs on the first floor, which head upwards). Some brochs such as Dun Dornaigil and Culswick in Shetland have unusual triangular lintels above the <b>entrance</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E

These doors for the central entrance, the separate <b>entrance</b> <b>doors</b> for each House building, and the bronze doors inside the building were outsourced to and built by Tokyo School of Fine Arts (currently Tokyo University of the Arts).|$|R
