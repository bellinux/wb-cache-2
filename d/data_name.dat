It is designed to enable government agencies to deliver a retail public service, securely based on biometric data (fingerprint, iris scan and face photo), along with demographic <b>data</b> (<b>name,</b> age, gender, address, parent/spouse name, mobile phone number) of a person.

The history also includes an enquiry about the individual's current social circumstances, family relationships, current and past use of alcohol and illicit drugs, and the individual's past treatment history (current and past diagnoses, and use of prescribed medication).|$|E

40|$|The Application Level Framing (ALF) {{protocol}} architecture [2] encourages application {{control over}} mechanisms that traditionally {{fall within the}} "transport layer", e. g., loss detection and recovery. Traditional ARQ-based reliable protocols for unicast (e. g., TCP) as well as multicast (e. g., Horus [30], RMTP [15], etc.) number data units sequentially to detect losses. Unfortunately, these transport-level sequence numbers do not permit receivers to flexibly tailor their reliability semantics. Achieving receiver-driven reliability is cumbersome in the existing "layered" architecture of the network protocol stack where the receiving application has no knowledge of how application-level objects map onto transport level sequence numbers. In this paper, we propose a new <b>data</b> <b>naming</b> scheme that exposes the structure of application data to the transport layer, thereby enhancing the expressibility of an applications' reliability and ordering semantics. We apply this <b>data</b> <b>naming</b> scheme to a reliab [...] ...|$|R
5000|$|Individuals {{would be}} able to buy their {{insurance}} from an exchange created in their state, which would be created in 2010. Premiums would be capped at 13% of the buyer's income, {{with the rest of the}} costs paid by subsidies. Insurance companies would be required to cover certain services such as hospitalization, maternity care, newborn care, chemotherapy, and pediatric care. Their plans would be presented as either bronze, silver, gold, and platinum options, sorted by the least to the most expensive. Only individuals and firms with fifty or fewer employees would be eligible to use the exchanges until 2017, when states would bring in larger employers. In 2022, they would become open to all. Persons who are not lawfully in the United States would not be permitted to participate in the exchange, either with or without subsidies.
