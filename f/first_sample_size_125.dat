40|$|In {{evaluation}} of the operating characteristics of mixed sampling plans (a known), the probability function, Fn(x), {{of the difference between}} the extreme value and the mean is important. Because it is an n multiple integral where n is the <b>first</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> of a mixed dependent sampling plan, the normal way of evaluating this probability is the recursive quadrature method. Using this method, as the <b>first</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> increases, the amount of computation increases exponentially, so that this probability function becomes a bottleneck in computation. This thesis presents a Taylor-expansion method for handling the probability function for large <b>first</b> <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> with satisfactory precision, for an arbitrary given x. In such a way, the {{evaluation of}} the dependent mixed plans is extended to a larger <b>first</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> than previously available in the literature. Theoretically, the computational method presented here could be used for evaluating mixed plans of very large <b>first</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size.</b> Technically, however, this method is limited, by the computer memory resources. Using the computational approach described above, a FORTRAN program that can compute the operating characteristics of mixed plans for <b>first</b> <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> of up to 50 was developed. A series of mixed dependent sampling plans were then evaluated with an accuracy of seven decimal places...|$|R

40|$|Extensions of latent state-trait {{models for}} {{continuous}} observed variables to mixture latent state-trait models {{with and without}} covariates of change are presented which can separate individuals differing in their occasion-specific variability. The basic model equations are given and the necessary and theoretical meaningful restrictions that {{must be made to}} apply the models are elaborated. An empirical application to the repeated measurement of mood states (N = 501) revealed that a model with two latent classes fits the data well. The larger class (76 %) consists of individuals whose mood is highly variable, whose general well-being is comparatively lower, and whose mood variability is influenced by daily hassles and uplifts. The smaller class (24 %) represents individuals that are rather stable, happier, and whose mood is only influenced by daily uplifts but not by daily hassles. The second class can be interpreted as a class of resilient individuals. A simulation study on the model without covariates with five sets of <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> (<b>125,</b> 250, 500, 1, 000, and 2, 000) and five sets of number of occasions (2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 occasions of measurement) revealed that the appropriateness of the parameter estimates of this model depends on number of observations (the higher the better) and the number of occasions (the higher the better). The parameters of the model without covariates can be appropriately estimated with at least 4 occasions and 250 individuals. Another simulation study estimated type I and II errors of the Lo-Mendell-Rubin test. This simulation study shows that the type I error is close to its expected value and the type II error is very low for a <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> of 500 observations. A simulation study with the same 5 sets of <b>sample</b> <b>sizes</b> showed that, for the model with covariates of change, 1, 000 observations are necessary for all parameters to be precisely estimated.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} describes 2 {{studies of}} Therapist Personal Agency among Marriage and Family Therapy (MFT) trainees. Using Social Cognitive Theory as a base, a theoretical model of Therapist Personal Agency was constructed, combining {{the influences of}} Therapist Self-Efficacy, relationships in the families of origin and creation, therapist development, supervisory relationship, peer relationships, client relationship, and psychological state. Study 1 tested this model through an online survey of MFT trainees across the United States and Canada. Analysis of several structural equation models revealed that all proposed factors, except peer relationships, were significant aspects of Therapist Personal Agency. An exploratory factor analysis of survey items yielded a four-factor model consisting of: Therapist Development (developmental level and self-efficacy), Family of Origin intimacy and fusion, Supervisory Support/Anxiety (supervisory relationship and psychological state) and Client Relationship. Study 1 also tested the supposition that Therapist Self-Efficacy {{would be the most}} important part of Therapist Personal Agency. This supposition was not supported. Instead, Training Environment variables and the Supervisory Support/Anxiety factor were shown to have the highest regression weights. Study 2 tested whether Therapist Personal Agency significantly affected therapist performance as reported by supervisors and clients, and whether Therapist Personal Agency was a better predictor of performance than Therapist Self-Efficacy. Supervisors reported on intervention skills and supervisory working alliance, while clients reported on working alliance and impressions of therapists 2 ̆ 7 personality and professionalism. Data was collected via pen and paper surveys from therapists (and their clients and supervisors) training at several programs in southern New England and from some participants from Study 1. Reliable analysis was impossible, however, due to a very poor return rate. Limitations to these studies included a small <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> (<b>125</b> for Study 1, 19 for Study 2) and homogeneity within the samples. Trainers and supervisors of MFTs are encouraged to be attentive to the factors of personal agency, and future research is recommended in order to more accurately study the relationship between Therapist Personal Agency and performance. As the factors and correlates of Therapist Personal Agency and performance are discovered, the gaps between training, self of the therapist, and performance may be bridged. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{current study}} had several {{limitations}} {{that should be}} considered. <b>First,</b> <b>sample</b> <b>size</b> (N =  3) was small, and thus {{we may not have}} represented all of the different lateral condyle fracture patterns that are seen in the general population. That is, the study was limited to one type of fracture pattern, which may not thoroughly represent the clinical aspects of displacement as a function of elbow motion represented in the present study. Moreover, there is large variation among cadaveric specimens in general, and the specific anatomy and geometry of the elbow in these specimens may have affected the results as well. Second, adult cadaveric specimens were used, as pediatric cadaveric specimens are unavailable in the United States for biomechanics research. Furthermore, to maintain consistency throughout testing, the forearms were rotated about two axes: the central axis of the forearm (isolating the effect of muscle pull), and the lateral edge of the hand (inducing varus bending). Despite showing minimal differences during these rotations, the experimental setup may have overly limited the forces. When a patient pronates his arm, the medial aspect of the forearm does not remain fixed, and the result is a hinged pronation with a much greater arc length. As a result, higher varus bending may be seen clinically, resulting in larger forces, thus affecting fracture displacement more so than shown in this study.|$|R
