5|$|Alonso {{ran across}} the grass at turn one again on lap 15, which {{resulted}} in him falling further behind Hamilton. Three laps later he made a similar mistake at the same turn, resulting in him sliding across the grass {{for the third time}} in the race. This caused him to <b>drop</b> <b>back</b> to fourth as it allowed Massa to go round the inside of Alonso into third.|$|E
5|$|Other notable {{performances}} {{came from}} Berger, {{who took the}} final podium position despite being delayed {{during one of his}} routine pit stops due to a problem with a loose wheel nut; Mika Häkkinen, who finished fourth for the McLaren team despite its new car proving to be uncompetitive in pre-season testing; and Mika Salo, who drove strongly {{in the first half of}} the race to run third in his first Grand Prix for the Tyrrell team, only to suffer from a cramp and <b>drop</b> <b>back</b> to seventh place at the finish. Behind Häkkinen, the other points-scoring finishers were Jean Alesi in the second Ferrari and Mark Blundell, who drove the second McLaren. Blundell was standing in for regular driver Nigel Mansell in the second McLaren until the team could produce a wider chassis in which to accommodate him, as the car's initial cockpit design had proved to be too narrow for him to drive comfortably.|$|E
5|$|When a {{continuous}} spectrum of energy is {{passed through a}} gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so <b>drop</b> <b>back</b> to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark absorption bands in the energy output. (An observer viewing the atoms from a view {{that does not include}} the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of emission lines from the photons emitted by the atoms.) Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of atomic spectral lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.|$|E

25|$|Following {{their loss}} to the Orioles in the 1983 World Series the team would follow with near playoff misses and a rapid <b>drop</b> <b>back</b> into the {{basement}} of the National League over the next five seasons. In 1989 Mike Schmidt retired from the Phillies and thus the last member of the 1980 championship team was gone.|$|E
25|$|He {{then passed}} Piquet to take second, with Patrese {{following}} him through soon after. Piquet began to <b>drop</b> <b>back</b> and Berger passed him. Patrese had gearbox troubles and was suddenly behind Berger and Piquet. On lap 41, de Cesaris, around 2 seconds behind Senna retired when his engine expired. Moreno passed the struggling Patrese {{on the next}} lap. Senna won with Berger making it a McLaren 1–2 ahead of Piquet, Moreno, Patrese and Mark Blundell.|$|E
25|$|Berger's engine failed on lap 6 {{and soon}} {{afterwards}} Patrese passed Senna {{and set off}} after Mansell. Modena then began to <b>drop</b> <b>back.</b> Patrese passed Mansell and then both Senna and Alesi had a go at the Englishman with Alesi spinning and dropping back to seventh. Patrese then began {{to pull away from}} Mansell who was holding up Senna. Meanwhile, Alesi passed Moreno and then de Cesaris as Mansell pulled away from Senna. He closed the gap to Patrese to 1.2 seconds before Patrese increased his pace and made the gap stable.|$|E

25|$|Milne ordered Gloucester to disengage, still expecting Souchon to turn west, {{but it was}} {{apparent}} to Gloucester′s captain that Goeben was fleeing. Breslau attempted to harass Gloucester into breaking off—Souchon had a collier waiting {{off the coast of}} Greece and needed to shake his pursuer before he could rendezvous. Gloucester finally engaged Breslau, hoping this would compel Goeben to <b>drop</b> <b>back</b> and protect the light cruiser. According to Souchon, Breslau was hit, but no damage was done. The action then broke off without further hits being scored. Finally, Milne ordered Gloucester to cease pursuit at Cape Matapan.|$|E
25|$|All the {{demolition}} work was complete by Chaytor's column by 10:20 when they withdrew. By 14:20 their demolition teams and the 1st Light Horse Brigade were seen passing Hill 860 {{just north of}} Khalasa. After they cleared the line the 2nd Light Horse Brigade began to <b>drop</b> <b>back</b> through Khalasa with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade covering the withdrawal to Esani where the force watered and fed before riding back with the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade as rearguard. The whole force marched back to Tel el Fara camp. During the retirement crops were burned by the 2nd Light Horse and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigades estimated to be 110m tons. Thirteen prisoners were captured.|$|E
25|$|On race day, Hunt made a fast {{start to}} lead {{into the first}} corner from Andretti and Reutemann, with Peterson {{dropping}} to ninth. Andretti re-passed Hunt on lap 6 and then started to pull away. Reutemann ran third until he had to pit for tyres, and so John Watson inherited third until he was passed by Jacques Laffite, but soon the recovering Peterson passed both of them. Hunt now suffered from tyre problems and he also began to <b>drop</b> <b>back,</b> and so Peterson moved into second with Laffite third. This was how it stayed to the end, Andretti winning from Peterson in another Lotus 1–2, and Laffite taking the final spot on the podium.|$|E

25|$|The major {{benefits}} of this tactic is that the team is in complete control over its opponents. Meanwhile, by knocking the ball around, opponents playing the pressing game can easily tire. And should an opportunity suddenly arise, defence may be quickly switched to attack. A major downfall is that because the accuracy of passes needs to be high, short passes between the players are required. This significantly narrows {{the gap between the}} attack, midfield and defence (usually, the latter is forced to push up). So if the opponent gains possession, a long ball could effectively open up the defence. Similarly, if it is the attack and midfield that need to <b>drop</b> <b>back,</b> the team will have little chances of counter-attacking even if possession is won back.|$|E
25|$|Late in {{the tackle}} count, when the attacking side {{is more likely}} to kick, the fullback and wingers <b>drop</b> <b>back</b> towards the {{defending}} team's in-goal area. As the name suggests, the fullback covers the end of the field and in-goal area whilst the wingers cover the edges of the field and the area between the defensive line and the fullback. A kick to the corner can be more efficiently fielded by a winger than by pulling the fullback out of position, while a long kick {{to the end of the}} field is best taken by the fullback. The use of the fullback and wingers to defend against potential kicks allows the other rear defenders to become available to receive a pass as their side receives the ball and begins its set.|$|E
25|$|A very {{important}} {{difference between a}} gas of massive particles and a photon gas with a black body distribution is {{that the number of}} photons in the system is not conserved. A photon may collide with an electron in the wall, exciting it to a higher energy state, removing a photon from the photon gas. This electron may <b>drop</b> <b>back</b> to its lower level in a series of steps, each one of which releases an individual photon back into the photon gas. Although the sum of the photon energies of the emitted photons are the same as the absorbed photon, the number of emitted photons will vary. It can be shown that, {{as a result of this}} lack of constraint on the number of photons in the system, the chemical potential of the photons must be zero for black body radiation.|$|E

25|$|In November 2008 {{he scored}} 11–4, sending him to komusubi {{for the fifth}} time in the January 2009 tournament. He scored eight wins there, and Aminishiki's losing record meant Kisenosato finally made his long-awaited sekiwake debut in March 2009, in his tenth tournament at a san'yaku rank. He {{produced}} a somewhat disappointing 5–10 record and was demoted to maegashira 4 in May. However, he proved this rank was too low for him by producing a 13–2 record, his best ever top division score, and won his third Fighting Spirit prize. This performance returned him immediately to sekiwake for the July 2009 tournament. He came though with a good 9–6 score there, defeating Asashōryū (for the fourth time) and three ōzeki. In September he failed on the final day to get kachi-koshi but remained in the san'yaku ranks at komusubi for the November 2009 tournament. However, a 6–9 in Kyushu saw him <b>drop</b> <b>back</b> to the maegashira ranks.|$|E
25|$|The city {{is home to}} Cambridge United F.C., {{who play}} at the Abbey Stadium. Formed in 1912, as Abbey United, they were elected to the Football League in 1970 and reached the Football League Second Division in 1978, {{although}} a serious decline in them in the mid 1980s saw them <b>drop</b> <b>back</b> down to the Football League Fourth Division and almost go out of business. Success returned to the club in the early 1990s when they won two successive promotions and reached the FA Cup quarter finals in both of those seasons, and in 1992 they came close to becoming the first English team to win three successive Football League promotions which would have taken them into the newly created FA Premier League. But they were beaten in the playoffs and another decline set in, which was completed in 2005 when they were relegated from the Football League and {{for the second time}} in 20 years narrowly avoided going out of business. After nine years of non league football they returned to the Football League in 2014 by winning the Conference National playoffs.|$|E
25|$|On 4 February 2017, Southampton hosted West Ham United {{and lost}} 3–1 to <b>drop</b> <b>back</b> to 13th {{in the league}} table. New signing Manolo Gabbiadini opened the scoring on his debut after 12 minutes, but the {{visitors}} equalised just two minutes later through Andy Carroll. Pedro Obiang scored a long-range effort just before the break, and later on Mark Noble made it three for the Hammers. The following week, Southampton picked up their biggest win of the season when they beat bottom-placed Sunderland 4–0. After a relatively even opening to the game, Gabbiadini opened the scoring for the Saints {{after half an hour}} with his second goal in his second game, converting a cross from Ryan Bertrand. On the stroke of half-time the recent signing doubled the visitors' lead with his third goal in two games. Shortly before full-time it was 3–0 thanks to an own goal from Jason Denayer, and in injury time Shane Long made it four to take Southampton up to 11th in the table. Wahbi Khazri scored a consolation before the end, but it was disallowed for handball.|$|E

25|$|At Juventus, Capello {{rejected}} the club's board members' requests to field a three-man front line {{and once again}} reverted to his preferred 4–4–2 formation. Capello won consecutive league titles, and put together a balanced and efficient side which was built upon a strong and highly organised back-line, which was further supported by two dynamic, defensive-minded box-to-box midfielders in the centre, such as Manuele Blasi, Stephen Appiah, Alessio Tacchinardi, Emerson, and later Patrick Vieira, who both alternated defensive and playmaking duties in midfield; the team's attacking wingers, Pavel Nedvěd and Mauro Camoranesi, were required both to <b>drop</b> <b>back</b> defensively and also assist the strikers from an offensive standpoint. Capello usually partnered the team's main striker David Trezeguet alongside the emerging Zlatan Ibrahimović up-front, with the latter playing in a more creative role, while the team's captain, Alessandro Del Piero, was used mostly as a substitute. Capello also introduced several younger players into the squad, such as the Romanian striker Adrian Mutu, and left-back Giorgio Chiellini; the latter's performances later prompted Capello to bench Jonathan Zebina and shift left-back Gianluca Zambrotta to right-back, {{in order to accommodate}} the youngster into the first team.|$|E
25|$|While {{the backs}} prepare {{to receive a}} kick, the other {{defenders}} will attempt to apply pressure to the kicker. It is usually rather predictable when a side is about to kick: normally {{one member of the}} attacking team is in charge of kicking, and as the team prepares to kick, he will <b>drop</b> <b>back</b> and make himself available deep behind the dummy half, to give himself space and time to set up for the kick. To limit the kicker's effectiveness, the defenders will often rush up out of the defensive line towards him. As well as giving him less time to set up, this action can cloud the kicker's mind, distracting him with thoughts of the upcoming tackle or encouraging him to consider switching to another attacking option due to the sudden change in the defensive line. This combination of physical and mental pressure may lead to a poor kick, giving an advantage to the non-kicking team. This manoeuvre could also result in a 'charge-down', if a defending player manages {{to get in the way}} of the ball very shortly after it is kicked (If the ball travels forward this is an exception to the knock-on rule). This often results in a line break or try to the previously defending team, however it runs the risk of having the attacking team regather the ball for a new set of tackles.|$|E
