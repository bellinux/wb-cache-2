40|$|INTRODUCTION : Malnutrition is {{the most}} {{widespread}} condition affecting {{the health of the}} children. Scarcity of suitable foods, lack of purchasing power of the family as well as traditional beliefs and taboos about what the baby should eat, often lead to an <b>insufficient</b> <b>balanced</b> diet, resulting in malnutrition. Culturally related food restriction and reduction in feeding frequency during common childhood illnesses further contributes to the burden of malnutrition and thus to childhood morbidity and mortality. METHODOLOGY : A hospital based, cross sectional descriptive study was conducted among 100 ill children less than 5 years age attending outpatient department of pediatrics in a tertiary care hospital, Visakhapatnam. A semi structured, pretested interview schedule was ad ministered after taking prior consent from mothers. Results were analyzed by using MS Excel.

In recent years, farmers 2 ̆ 7 incomes {{have been}} {{increasingly}} volatile due to variation in crop prices, crop productivity, fertilizer expense, farmland cash rents and farmland values. Previous studies focus on those variations separately. There has been little research on analyzing financial performance {{of a set of}} representative farms under a combination of risks from prices, costs and productivity. In {{the first part of this}} study, a parametric stochastic simulation was used to model price and yield of corn and soybean, fertilizer price, cash rent and farmland value for a three-year period from 2012 to 2015. In the second part, a test was performed on financial performance of a set representative farms with various scales, farmland ownerships, and capital structures in Central Illinois under the shock of simulated price, yield and expense with the presense of crop insurance and crop hedge using futures. Management adjustments were implemented for situations of excess or <b>insufficient</b> cash <b>balances</b> within the simulation period. Results were analyzed and compared. Larger farms were found to be more likely to obtain financial success with their farm businesses. Farms with lower farmland ownership were found to have higher possibilities of <b>insufficient</b> cash <b>balance</b> to meet all financial obligations and have to either finance the cash insufficiency with further borrowing or shrink their farm business due to high cash rent expense crashing farm revenues. Farms with a capital structure of lower debt proportion were found to be more likely to meet all financial obligations with cash generated from farm operation, while a higher debt load made the farm business risker because the deviation in rate of return on equity increased and the possibility of having an <b>insufficient</b> cash <b>balance</b> was increased when the debt-to-asset ratio increased [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to propose a {{fundamentally}} new extension of the marketing paradigm. This is theoretically and practically necessary since in the authors' view there is an <b>insufficient</b> <b>balance</b> between customer and brand thinking. Design/methodology/approach - While the marketing paradigm is focused on customers, marketing strategy focuses on both the demand and supply side of the market. The authors suggest bringing the paradigm and strategy more in line by adding the brand identity into a new, more balanced, marketing paradigm, called identity based marketing. Findings - The brand identity can be considered the representative of the resource based view since identity will be based on competences and capabilities. Although branding is widely accepted as a marketing issue it has until now not been dealt with within the scope of the marketing paradigm. Originality/value - Adding branding to the highest level in the marketing theory hierarchy (marketing as concept/paradigm, strategy, and tactics), has important implications for marketing practice and leads to a research agenda with more emphasis on the relation between (changes in) brand identity and customer perceptions and needs...|$|E

Methods: Twelve chronic stroke survivors with persistent paresis of an upper limb underwent 60 minutes of adapted TC twice a week for eight weeks, with a 4 -week follow up. A 10 -min TC home program was recommended for the days without sessions. TC level of performance, attendance to the sessions, duration of self-practice at home, and adapted TC movements used were recorded. Results: Eleven participants completed the study. A clinical reasoning algorithm underlying the adaptation of TC was elaborated throughout the trial. Participants with varying profiles including a severely impaired upper limb, poor balance, shoulder pain, and severe spasticity were not only capable of practicing the adapted TC, but attended all 16 sessions and practiced TC at home {{for a total of}} 16. 51 ± 9. 21 h. The degree of self-practice for subgroups with low upper limb function, shoulder pain, or moderate-to-severe spasticity was similar to that of subgroups with greater upper limb function, no shoulder pain, and minimal-to-no spasticity. Conclusion: Adapted TC seems feasible for upper limb rehabilitation post stroke. Although the study was based on a small sample size and requires confirmation, low upper limb function, <b>insufficient</b> <b>balance,</b> spasticity, and shoulder pain do not appear to hinder the practice of TC...|$|E

40|$|One of the Federal Reserve's roles is {{to provide}} payment {{services}} to depository institutions and to the U. S. Treasury. Many of the nation's transfers of funds [...] whether they are large-dollar payments for financial market transactions or small-value business and consumer payments [...] settle through depository institutions' accounts held at the Federal Reserve for reserve-maintenance purposes and transaction processing. If a depository institution has <b>insufficient</b> <b>balances</b> during the day to cover its debits, it will run a negative balance or "daylight overdraft" in its Federal Reserve account until sufficient funds are received later in the day. Because depository institutions generally hold a relatively small amount of funds overnight in their Federal Reserve accounts {{in relation to the}} trillions of dollars of payments processed by the Federal Reserve each day, the Federal Reserve extends intraday credit to ensure the smooth functioning of the U. S. payment system. To reduce the risks that depository institutions present to the Federal Reserve through their use of daylight credit and to address the risks that payment systems, in general, present to the banking system and other sectors of the economy, the Federal Reserve Board in 1985 developed a payments system risk (PSR) policy. One of the primary goals of the PSR policy is to control depository institutions' use of Federal Reserve intraday credit, and as the policy has evolved, the Board has adopted specific methods for controlling daylight overdrafts. The history of the Board's PSR policy, trends in daylight overdraft and payment activity, and a possible future policy direction are discussed in this article. Overdrafts; Payment systems...|$|R

We apply the methodology to picture such imbalances as funda- mental drivers behind the tragedy of the commons. And we apply it to go deeper into a specific business example in this context, a complex case of resource exploitation in Far East Asia. The CLD analyses inform a discussion on the interplay between societies on the one hand, represented by the Government and its legislature, and the private sector with its companies, consumers and market on the other. Our study confirms that unsustainability can only be understood and addressed at the systemic level, encom- passing both natural and social systems, where also the virtual and emergent systems of modern civi- lization are considered. The results show that a market economy can only be sustainable as well as really free, when embedded in a systemic and balanced interplay between the actors on the arena.

The near absence of mobile charge in the depletion layer means that the mobile charges present are <b>insufficient</b> to <b>balance</b> the immobile charge contributed by the dopant ions: a negative charge on the p-type side due to acceptor dopant and as a positive charge on the n-type side due to donor dopant. Because of this charge there is an electric field in this region, as determined by Poisson's equation. The width of the depletion region adjusts so the negative acceptor charge on the p-side exactly balances the positive donor charge on the n-side, so there is no electric field outside the depletion region on either side.|$|R

The model solution attains a potential distribution which both satisfies the condition of charge neutrality and zero current. For the range of parameters considered in {{this study we}} find that a 45 - 60 volt discontinuous potential drop may develop to reflect most of the photoelectrons back toward the ionosphere.
