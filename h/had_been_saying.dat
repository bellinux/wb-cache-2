5|$|The 1891 census {{records the}} Wildes' {{residence}} at 16 Tite Street, {{where he lived}} with his wife Constance and two sons. Wilde though, not content with being better known than ever in London, returned to Paris in October 1891, this time as a respected writer. He was received at the salons littéraires, including the famous mardis of Stéphane Mallarmé, a renowned symbolist poet of the time. Wilde's two plays during the 1880s, Vera; or, The Nihilists and The Duchess of Padua, had not met with much success. He had continued his interest in the theatre and now, after finding his voice in prose, his thoughts turned again to the dramatic form as the biblical iconography of Salome filled his mind. One evening, after discussing depictions of Salome throughout history, he returned to his hotel and noticed a blank copybook lying on the desk, and it occurred to him to write in it what he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying.</b> The result was a new play, Salomé, written rapidly and in French.|$|E
25|$|He placed {{second in}} MoveOn.org's primary, behind Dean. He also placed first in other polls, {{particularly}} Internet-based ones. This led many activists {{to believe that}} his showing in the primaries might be better than what Gallup polls <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying.</b> However, in the non-binding Washington, D.C. primary, Kucinich finished fourth (last out of candidates listed on the ballot), with only 8% of the vote. Support for Kucinich was most prevalent in the caucuses around the country.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Melinda Henneberger in The New York Times, Wolf denied ever advising Gore on his wardrobe. Wolf herself said she mentioned the term [...] "alpha male" [...] only once in passing and that [...] " [...] was just a truism, something the pundits <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> for months, {{that the vice president}} is in a supportive role and the President is in an initiatory role... I used those terms as shorthand in talking about the difference in their job descriptions".|$|E

6000|$|... "I mean," [...] said Béla, with {{a return}} to his former swagger, [...] "that you <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> to {{yourself}} this past half-hour: 'Oho! but Elsa is not married yet! The vows are not yet spoken, and until they <b>are</b> I still <b>have</b> my chance.' That's what you <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> to yourself, eh, Mr. Guardian Angel?" ...|$|R
60|$|ALICE HEMINGWAY. [With {{sudden change}} of front.] Then {{you ought to}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> {{something}} to her.|$|R
2500|$|In {{response}} to the quite simple, but very expensive car with relatively little {{out of the ordinary}} being called a [...] "cynical money-making exercise" [...] aimed at speculators, a figure from the Ferrari marketing department was quoted as saying [...] "We wanted it to be very fast, sporting in the extreme and Spartan," [...] "Customers <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> our cars were becoming too plush and comfortable." [...] "The F40 is for the most enthusiastic of our owners who want nothing but sheer performance. It isn't a laboratory for the future, as the 959 is. It is not Star Wars. And it wasn't created because Porsche built the 959. It would have happened anyway." ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 2016, the Department's Office of the Inspector General Steve Linick {{released}} an 83-page {{report about the}} State Department's email practices. The Inspector General {{was unable to find}} evidence that Clinton had ever sought approval from the State Department staff for her use of a private email server, determining that if Clinton had sought approval, Department staff would have declined her setup because of the [...] "security risks in doing so". Aside from security risks, the report stated that [...] "she did not comply with the Department's policies that were implemented in accordance with the Federal Records Act." [...] Each of these findings contradicted what Clinton and her aides <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> up to that point. The report also stated that Clinton and her senior aides declined to speak with the investigators, while the previous four Secretaries of State did so.|$|E

6000|$|The Professor {{knows this}} well enough, and {{is doing his}} best to keep his mind active. What he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> <b>was,</b> under the circumstances, of {{absorbing}} interest. So well as I can remember, here it is: ...|$|R
60|$|The doctor's face {{expressed}} {{a kind of}} doubting admiration. 'If they were all as unemotional' he might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying.</b>|$|R
60|$|I <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> that I {{was just}} twenty, and Jim {{said that he}} was twenty-seven.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Holiday {{smiled and}} then paused. He was reflecting, apparently, upon what Rollo <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying.</b>|$|E

60|$|She hesitated, and at {{that moment}} Mr. Fischer, who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> {{farewell}} to his guests, turned towards her.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{this time}} you had better go to the wolves,' said she, not knowing that the prince had heard all she <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying.</b>|$|E
6000|$|At that {{important}} {{point in the}} conversation they were interrupted by the reappearance of Blanche. Had she, by any accident, heard what they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying?</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That <b>is</b> what I <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> to myself, Doctor, {{but that}} does not in the {{slightest}} degree shake my conviction about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{hoped to}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> {{a word in}} the cause of the young people, but she regretted her attempt, for Lady Rotherwood replied--- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And Aunt Sarah <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying</b> {{exactly the}} same to me. You can't think how eloquent Aunt Sarah <b>has</b> <b>been.</b> And her energy has quite {{surprised}} me." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "O very well, I dare say," [...] said Beatrice, rather absently, for she {{was looking}} at her aunt's {{delicate}} fragile form, and thinking of what her father <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>saying.</b>|$|E
