However, {{the effects of}} tillage method or straw return on soil organic C (SOC) have showed inconsistent results in different soil/ climate/cropping systems. The Yangtze River Delta of China is the main production region of rice and wheat, and rice-wheat rotation {{is the most important}} cropping system in this region. However, few studies in this region have been conducted to assess the effects of different tillage methods combined with straw return on soil labile C fractions in the rice-wheat rotation system. In this study, a field experiment was used to evaluate the effects of different tillage methods, straw return and their interaction on soil total organic C (TOC) and labile organic C fractions at three soil depths (0 – 7, 7 – 14 and 14 – 21 cm) for a rice-wheat rotation in Yangzhong of the Yangtze River Delta of China. Soil TOC, easily oxidizable C (EOC), dissolved organic C (DOC) and microbial biomass C (MBC) contents were measured in this study.

40|$|Pulse {{crops in}} Bangladesh are mainly low-input rainfed crops with {{broadcast}} sowing. Since the 1990 s, <b>rotary</b> <b>tillage</b> two-wheel tractors (2 WT) have largely replaced animal draft for crop establishment. However, <b>rotary</b> <b>tillage</b> causes excessive evaporation from seedbeds in rapidly-drying soils. Therefore 2 WT-based minimum tillage (MT) options were explored to optimize seedbed moisture for lentil and chickpea establishment. Two types of 2 WT-mounted seeding units were manufactured, a strip tiller retaining rotary blades only {{in front of}} the tynes and a tyne seeder in which the rotary tiller shaft is removed. In some soil types, seedling emergence and grain yields of lentil and chickpea with these seeders matched those with broadcasting. In wet soils, the minimal soil disturbance with MT resulted in anaerobic conditions around seedling roots thereby limiting root growth and nodulation. In clay soils with rapid surface drying traction was inadequate for tyne tillage and strip tillage could not adequately penetrate rice paddy hardpans to allow adequate growth of seedling roots. Potential solutions to these limitations are under test so that 2 WT-based MT can be adapted for more timely and economic sowing of crops, including pulses, in smallholder plots and to achieve the agronomic benefits of line sowing over broadcast sowing...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the effect of <b>rotary</b> <b>tillage</b> on some soil physical properties (bulk density, cone index, plasticity index, aggregate uniformity coefficient) and organic matter, and to develop and evaluate a soil tilth index based on changes of these soil properties. The tillage treatments were 4 x 3 factorial combinations of forward speeds obtained with four selected tractor transmission gears (Gear 1 High, Gear 2 Low, Gear 3 Low and Gear 4 Low), and three rotary tilling speeds (140 rpm, 175 rpm and 200 rpm) of commonly used tillage implements in Malaysian paddy fields. Experimental results indicated a significant decrease in bulk density of the soil due to <b>rotary</b> <b>tillage.</b> The other soil parameters were not significantly affected by the tillage operation. Analysis of variance indicated significant difference (p< 0. 01) among the rice yield means. Bulk density was identified to have a high positive correlation with the rice yield. A tilth index consequently developed with bulk density, cone index and plasticity index gave better predictability (r 2 = 0. 56) of rice yield than when individual soil properties were considered.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the emission characteristics of GHG (CH 4 and N 2 O) under four reduced tillage systems from October 2007 to August 2009 based on a 10 -yr tillage experiment in the North China Plain, which included no-tillage (NT) and three reduced tillage systems of subsoil tillage (ST), harrow <b>tillage</b> (HT) and <b>rotary</b> <b>tillage</b> (RT), with the conventional tillage (CT) as the control. The soil under the five tillage systems was an absorption sink for CH 4 and an emission source for N 2 O. The soil temperature positive impacted on the CH 4 absorption by the soils of different tillage systems, while a significant negative correlation was observed between the absorption and soil moisture. The main driving factor for increased N 2 O emission was not the soil temperature but the soil moisture and the content of nitrate.

40|$|Background: Agricultural tractor is the {{agricultural}} machinery which conducts several operations using various implements such as harvester, baler and trailer. Power {{from the engine}} is directly transmitted to driving shafts and PTO (Power Take Off) shaft. Power delivered to PTO shaft is transmitted to the implements through the PTO gear. The gears are components of transmission which transmit the power of an engine to a machine and offers various speed ratios, a compact structure and high efficiency of power transmission. A gear train design in the automotive industry uses simulation software. However, the PTO gear design for agricultural applications uses the empirical method because of {{the wide range of}} load fluctuations in agricultural fields. Methods: Therefore, severity analysis with agricultural operation of PTO gear using a simulation is essential to the optimal design of the PTO gear. In this study, severity analysis using a simulation proceeded in full load condition and real work condition (70 % <b>rotary</b> <b>tillage,</b> 30 % baler operation) during the <b>rotary</b> <b>tillage,</b> baler operation.

A factorial experiment having a strip split-split arrangement, with tillage methods in the main plots, mulch levels in the sub plots and N-fertilizer levels in the sub-sub plots with three replicates, was used for this study. The CO 2 data were recorded three times per week using a portable GXH- 3010 E 1 gas analyzer. The highest CO 2 emissions were recorded following <b>rotary</b> <b>tillage,</b> compared to the lowest emissions from the zero tillage planting method. The lowest emissions were recorded at the 160 kg N/ha, fertilizer level. Higher CO 2 emissions were recorded during the cropping year 2010 – 11 relative to the year 2011 – 12. During cropping year 2010 – 11, applications of corn residue mulch significantly increased CO 2 emissions in comparison to the non-mulched treatments, and during the year 2011 – 12, equal emissions were recorded for both types of mulch treatments. Higher CO 2 emissions were recorded immediately after the tillage operations.

The background to the experiment was a 2005 study showing potentially higher yield, higher cleanness and higher sugar con tent when primary tillage was carried out to 35 cm depth with a rotary cultivator. On four field sites in Skåne (L:a Isie, Ädelholm, Stävie and Vragerup), five different treatments were compared: mouldboard ploughing in the autumn to 20 cm; mouldboard ploughing in the autumn to 20 cm + rotary cultivation in the spring to 35 cm; rotary cultivation in the autumn to 35 cm; rotary cultivation in the spring to 35 cm; and mouldboard ploughing in the spring to 20 cm. The rotary cultivator used in the treatments is manufactured by a Dutch company, Imants. The implement cultivates the soil with spade tines fitted on arms that are mounted on a horizontal rotating PTO-driven axle. Beet plants were inspected and yield determined in the experiment, and three soil parameters were examined: penetration resistance, water infiltration and infiltration of blue dye. Root shape was also examined. The site at Stävie was not harvested due to poor beet establishment. At the other sites, the highest yield was found when the soil was rotary-cultivated in the autumn. Pooling of the results from the three harvested sites showed that the yield was significantly higher (+ 4 %) and the sugar content was also significantly higher (+ 0. 3 %) when the soil was rotary-cultivated in the autumn compared with conventional mouldboard ploughing in the autumn. The penetration resistance tended to be lower and the water infiltration rate higher when soil was rotary-cultivated in the autumn. The amount of blue colour covering the soil was also higher. The conclusion is that <b>deep</b> <b>rotary</b> cultivation has good biological potential. However this study was unable to determine the reasons behind this potential...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to quantify soil methane (CH(4)) and nitrous oxide (N(2) O) emissions when converting from minimum and no-tillage systems to subsoiling (tilled soil to a depth of 40 cm to 45 cm) in the North China Plain. The relationships between CH(4) and N(2) O flux and soil temperature, moisture, NH(4) (+) -N, organic carbon (SOC) and pH were investigated over 18 months using a split-plot design. The soil absorption of CH(4) appeared to increase after conversion from no-tillage (NT) to subsoiling (NTS), from harrow tillage (HT) to subsoiling (HTS) and from <b>rotary</b> <b>tillage</b> (RT) to subsoiling (RTS). N(2) O emissions also increased after conversion. Furthermore, after conversion to subsoiling, the combined global warming potential (GWP) of CH(4) and N(2) O increased by approximately 0. 05 kg CO(2) ha(- 1) for HTS, 0. 02 kg CO(2) ha(- 1) for RTS and 0. 23 kg CO(2) ha(- 1) for NTS. Soil temperature, moisture, SOC, NH(4) (+) -N and pH also changed after conversion to subsoiling. These changes were correlated with CH(4) uptake and N(2) O emissions. However, there was no significant correlation between N(2) O emissions and soil temperature in this study. The grain yields of wheat improved after conversion to subsoiling. Under HTS, RTS and NTS, the average grain yield was elevated by approximately 42. 5 %, 27. 8 % and 60. 3 % respectively. Our findings indicate that RTS and HTS would be ideal rotation tillage systems to balance GWP decreases and grain yield improvements in the North China Plain region...|$|R
40|$|Shortages of {{hired labour}} are leading to greater {{interest}} in mechanisation for crop establishment in smallholder agriculture. Due to small field sizes, mechanised planters mounted on four-wheel tractors are not a suitable technology. The Versatile Multi-crop Planter (VMP) was developed for zero tillage (ZT), strip planting (SP) or single pass shallow tillage (SPST) on flat land and for forming and planting on tops of beds, each {{in a single pass}} operation, when mounted on a two-wheel tractor (2 WT). The aim {{of the present study was}} to evaluate the field performance of the VMP in comparison to conventional broadcast seeding and full <b>rotary</b> <b>tillage</b> (2 to 4 passes; called CT) for establishing chickpea (Cicer arietinum L.), jute (Corchorus olitorius L.), lentil (Lens culinaris Medikus), maize (Zea mays L.), mung bean (Vigna radiata L. R. Wilczek), rice (Oryza sativa L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in 15 locations of Bangladesh. Plant populations emerging from all single pass operations viz. SP, ZT, and bed planting (BP) were generally satisfactory and in 12 out of 15 experiments plant populations after SP were similar to or greater than after CT. In addition, SP gave comparable or greater plant populations than SPST and BP planting methods. Overall, the SP planting achieved comparable yields and lower costs of establishment than CT. We conclude that effective and reliable planters are now available for sowing a range of crop species on small fields with minimum soil disturbance. This opens up realistic options for the development of mechanised conservation agriculture suited to small field sizes...|$|R
40|$|Soil tillage is {{a process}} that accelerates soil organic matter {{decomposition}} transferring carbon to atmosphere, mainly in the CO 2 form. In this study, the effect of <b>rotary</b> <b>tillage</b> on soil CO 2 emission was investigated, including the presence of crop residues on the surface. Emissions were evaluated during 15 days after tillage in 3 plots: 1) non-tilled and without crop residues on soil surface (NTwo), 2) rotary tiller without the presence of crop residues on soil surface (RTwo), and 3) rotary tiller with the presence of crop residues in soil surface (RTw). Emissions from the RTw plot were higher than the other plots, (0. 777 g CO 2 m- 2 h- 1), with the lowest emissions recorded in the NTwo plot (0. 414 g CO 2 m- 2 h- 1). Total emission indicates that the difference of C-CO 2 emitted to atmosphere corresponds to 3 % of the total additional carbon in the crop residues in the RTw plot compared to RTwo. The increase in the RTwo emission in comparison to NTwo was followed by changes in the aggregate size distribution, especially those with average diameter lower than 2 mm. The increase in emission from the RTw plot in relation to RTwo was related to a decrease in crop residue mass on the surface, and its higher fragmentation and incorporation in soil. When the linear correlation between soil CO 2 emission, and soil temperature and soil moisture is considered, only the RTw treatment showed significant correlation (p< 0. 05) with soil moisture...|$|R
40|$|Investigations were {{conducted}} during the 2003, 2004 and 2005 growing seasons in northern Greece to evaluate effects of tillage regime (mouldboard plough, chisel plough and rotary tiller), cropping sequence (continuous cotton, cotton-sugar beet rotation and continuous tobacco) and herbicide treatment on weed seedbank dynamics. Amaranthus spp. and Portulaca oleracea were the most abundant species, ranging from 76 % to 89 % of total weed seeds found in 0 - 15 and 15 - 30 cm soil depths during the 3 years. With the mouldboard plough, 48 % and 52 % of the weed seedbank {{was found in the}} 0 - 15 and 15 - 30 cm soil horizons, while approximately 60 % was concentrated in the upper 15 cm soil horizon for chisel plough and <b>rotary</b> <b>tillage.</b> Mouldboard ploughing significantly buried more Echinochloa crus-galli seeds in the 15 - 30 cm soil horizon compared with the other tillage regimes. Total seedbank (0 - 30 cm) of P. oleracea was significantly reduced in cotton-sugar beet rotation compared with cotton and tobacco monocultures, while the opposite occurred for E. crus-galli. Total seed densities of most annual broad-leaved weed species (Amaranthus spp., P. oleracea, Solanum nigrum) and E. crus-galli were lower in herbicide treated than in untreated plots. The results suggest that in light textured soils, conventional tillage with herbicide use gradually reduces seed density of small seeded weed species in the top 15 cm over several years. In contrast, crop rotation with the early established sugar beet favours spring-germinating grass weed species, but also prevents establishment of summer-germinating weed species by the early developing crop canopy...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{greenhouse}} gases (GHG) emissions {{is becoming increasingly}} important with the climate change. Most previous {{studies have focused on}} the assessment of soil organic carbon (SOC) sequestration potential and GHG emissions from agriculture. However, specific experiments assessing tillage impacts on GHG emission from double-cropped paddy fields in Southern China are relatively scarce. Therefore, the objective {{of this study was to}} assess the effects of tillage systems on methane (CH 4) and nitrous oxide (N 2 O) emission in a double rice (Oryza sativa L.) cropping system. The experiment was established in 2005 in Hunan Province, China. Three tillage treatments were laid out in a randomized complete block design: conventional <b>tillage</b> (CT), <b>rotary</b> <b>tillage</b> (RT) and no-till (NT). Fluxes of CH 4 from different tillage treatments followed a similar trend during the two years, with a single peak emission for the early rice season and a double peak emission for the late rice season. Compared with other treatments, NT significantly reduced CH 4 emission among the rice growing seasons (P, 0. 05). However, much higher variations in N 2 O emission were observed across the rice growing seasons due to the vulnerability of N 2 O to external influences. The amount of CH 4 emission in paddy fields was much higher relative to N 2 O emission. Conversion of CT to NT significantly reduced the cumulative CH 4 emission for both rice seasons compared with other treatments (P, 0. 05). The mean value of global warming potentials (GWPs) of CH 4 and N 2 O emissions over 100 years was in the order of NT,RT,CT, which indicated NT was significantly lower than both CT and RT (P, 0. 05) ...|$|R

40|$|Compared to {{traditional}} plowing and minimum tillage, the sod seeding technique {{has been tested}} in order to evaluate the differences in energy consumption, labor and machinery requirement and CO 2 emission reduction. The experiments were conducted on winter cereal seeding in a Po valley farm in October 2011. The tests were carried out as follows: wheat variety seeding, over corn and alfalfa crops, in large plots with three repetitions for each thesis. They included: sod seeding anticipated by round up weeding {{in the case of}} the plots over alfalfa; traditional plowing at 35 cm followed by <b>rotary</b> <b>tillage</b> and combined seeding (seeder plus <b>rotary</b> tiller); minimum <b>tillage</b> based on ripping at the same depth (35 cm) and combined seeder (seeder plus rotary tiller). The following farm operations - fertilizer, and other agrochemical distributionshave been the same in all the considered theses. The results, statistically significant (P< 0. 001) in terms of yields, highlighted slight differences: the best data {{in the case of the}} traditional plowing both in the case of wheat crop over corn and alfalfa (84. 43 and 6. 75 t/ha); slightly lower yields for the sod seeding (6. 23 and 79. 9 t/ha for corn and alfalfa respectively); lower in the case of minimum tillage (5. 87; 79. 77 t/ha in the two situations). Huge differences in energy and oil consumption have been recorded: in the case of succession to corn 61. 47; 35. 31; 4. 27 kg oil/ha respectively for, traditional plowing, minimum tillage and sod seeding; in the case of alfalfa 61. 2; 50. 96; 5. 14 kg oil/ha respectively for traditional plowing, minimum tillage and sod seeding. The innovative technique, highlighted huge energy saving with an oil consumption equal to 92 % and 89 % (P< 0. 001) of what happens in traditional plowing and minimum tillage. Large differences concern labor and machine productivity. These parameters together with oil consumption and machine size [power (kW) and weight (t) ] lead to even greater differences in terms of energy consumption, efficiency and CO 2 emission savings. Considerations related to the different mechanizations chains, investments required and to some new practices to be introduced, such as low pressure tires or crawlers, ideal lanes, GPS and automatic guide systems to follow the ideal lanes, conclude the study...|$|R
