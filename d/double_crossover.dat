5|$|The {{most common}} such motif is the <b>double</b> <b>crossover</b> (DX) complex, which {{contains}} two Holliday junctions {{in close proximity}} to each other, resulting in a rigid structure that can self-assemble into larger arrays. The structure of the DX molecule forces the Holliday junctions to adopt a conformation with the double-helical domains directly side-by-side, in contrast to their preferred angle of about 60°. The complex can be designed to force the junctions into either a parallel or antiparallel orientation, but in practice the antiparallel variety are more well-behaved, and the parallel version is rarely used.|$|E
25|$|Recombination {{frequency}} is {{a measure}} of genetic linkage and is used {{in the creation of a}} genetic linkage map. Recombination frequency (θ) is the frequency with which a single chromosomal crossover will take place between two genes during meiosis. A centimorgan (cM) is a unit that describes a recombination frequency of 1%. In this way we can measure the genetic distance between two loci, based upon their recombination frequency. This is a good estimate of the real distance. Double crossovers would turn into no recombination. In this case we cannot tell if crossovers took place. If the loci we're analysing are very close (less than 7 cM) a <b>double</b> <b>crossover</b> is very unlikely. When distances become higher, the likelihood of a <b>double</b> <b>crossover</b> increases. As the likelihood of a <b>double</b> <b>crossover</b> increases we systematically underestimate the genetic distance between two loci.|$|E
25|$|The CMP {{utilizes}} {{several different}} methods to reduce traffic congestion. One innovative design {{that came out}} of one of the MPO's Congestion Management Studies is the Diverging diamond interchange (DDI). Because of the CMP suggesting that this type of interchange should be used to alleviate bottlenecks in the MPO area, KYTC chose to use a DDI design for the Harrodsburg Road and New Circle interchange. A public meeting was held on March 29, 2011 at Southern Hills United Methodist Church. This is the first Diverging Diamond Interchange (now called <b>Double</b> <b>Crossover</b> Diamond or DCD) in the state of Kentucky.|$|E

The segregation data were compared to a computer simulation that assumes trivalent pairing of homologues involved in exchanges, followed by nonpreferential segregation. Trivalent pairing was characterized by higher frequencies of exchange as compared to bivalent pairing, and {{by the presence of}} spores resulting from at least <b>double</b> <b>crossovers</b> involving all three homologues. Trivalent segregation was characterized by a unique recombinant class.

40|$|Analysis of {{systematic}} scan data from microsporocyte smear preparations suggests that cells with a crossover {{in a specific}} region tend to be geographically clustered to some extent within anthers. Crossover classes observed include single crossovers within a heterozygous inversion, three-strand <b>double</b> <b>crossovers</b> within and proximal to the inversion, and four-strand <b>double</b> <b>crossovers</b> within the inversion. Evidence for clustering within scans of cells {{of the first two}} classes is reported, but results are inconclusive for the third class. No evidence for within-scan correlation of frequencies of any two of the crossover classes was found. It is inferred that {{a large part of the}} variability in crossover frequency observed is probably due to factors which alter crossover interference. Implications related to the frequency and distribution of crossover sites are discussed...|$|R
25|$|The current {{plans for}} the Second Avenue Subway, made in the 2000s, will not use this space; the new Houston Street station will instead be built below the {{existing}} one, with a free transfer between them. The decision to use a deeper alignment under Chrystie Street was made to simplify construction and lessen impact to the community. Second Avenue service will be tentatively provided by the T train once Phase 3 of construction is complete. When this happens, the station will become a terminal station for southbound service. There will be a <b>double</b> <b>crossover</b> north of the station. However, Phase 4 of construction will extend the line south, below Houston Street, {{in the direction of}} Hanover Square.|$|E

This configuration was in place by 1924; before that trains reversed direction using a <b>double</b> <b>crossover</b> south of the platforms. Until October 17, 1949, the Astoria and Flushing Lines hosted both IRT and BMT service. Since the platforms were IRT-size, the BMT used its own elevated cars to provide service on the lines, with a required transfer at Queensboro Plaza.

40|$|We {{developed}} a gene replacement system using the rpsL gene of Streptomyces roseosporus and demonstrated its utility by constructing a deletion in the S. roseosporus glnA gene. A 1. 3 -kb BamHI fragment that hybridized to the Mycobacterium smegmatis rpsL gene was subcloned from an S. roseosporus cosmid library and sequenced. Plasmid pRHB 514 containing the rpsL gene conferred streptomycin sensitivity (Sm(S)) to the Sm(r) S. roseosporus TH 149. The temperature-sensitive plasmid pRHB 543 containing rpsL and the S. roseosporus glnA gene disrupted with a hygromycin resistance (Hm(r)) gene was introduced into S. roseosporus TH 149, and recombinants containing single and <b>double</b> <b>crossovers</b> were obtained after a temperature increase. Southern hybridization {{analysis revealed that}} single crossovers occurred in the glnA or rpsL genes and that <b>double</b> <b>crossovers</b> resulted in replacement of the chromosomal glnA gene with the disrupted glnA.

40|$|The {{distribution}} within anthers {{of maize}} plants of microsporocytes of differing crossover class was studied by {{application of the}} serial-sectioning technique to plants heterozygous for a paracentric inversion. In such material, cells with four-strand <b>double</b> <b>crossovers</b> within the inversion are distinguishable from cells with other classes of crossovers within the inverted region and from cells with no crossovers within the inversion. Evidence was found for coarse clustering of cells with four-strand <b>double</b> <b>crossovers</b> within the inversion and for coarse clustering of cells of other crossover classes (with at least one crossover within the inversion). The local frequencies of these two major categories of crossover cells appeared to vary independently of each other, with regional increases in each occurring {{at the expense of}} noncrossover cells. There is also some suggestion that cells with four-strand doubles within the inversion may be clustered independently of other double-crossover classes within the inversion, but these other classes are not directly scorable...|$|R

Analysis of rescued DNA from integrants with insertions into rrnG and rrnH indicated that these tandemly arranged operons allowed frequent deletions of an rrn operon equivalent.

40|$|Adjacent {{crossovers}} {{between the}} same pair of homologs {{tend to be}} widely and evenly spaced, a phenomenon known as positive crossover interference (Jones, 1987; Muller, 1916). The disproportionate increase in <b>double</b> <b>crossovers</b> in sgs 1 -∆C 795 cells suggests that positive crossover interference may be diminished. To test this possibility, two measurements of interference were calculated. The NPD ratio compares the number of NPDs observed in a single interval to that expected {{if there were no}} interference (Papazian, 1952). A ratio significantly less than one indicates positive crossover interference. In wild-type tetrads, all intervals show significant interference using this measurement (Figure S 2 A; Table S 3). In contrast, interference is greatly diminished in sgs 1 -∆C 795 tetrads. In four of nine intervals analyzed, NPD ratios are not different from one, suggesting no interference. One interval, LEU 2 -CEN 3, has a NPD ratio significantly greater than one indicating negative crossover interference, i. e. a greater than random frequency of <b>double</b> <b>crossovers.</b> Relatively weak but significant positive interference can still be detected in four intervals in sgs 1 -∆C 795 tetrads.

40|$|Three Australian {{doubled haploid}} populations {{were used to}} {{illustrate}} the importance of map curation {{in order to improve}} the quality of linkage maps and quantative trait locus (QTL) detection. The maps were refined and improved by re-examining the order of markers, inspection of the genetic maps in relation to a consensus map, editing the marker data for <b>double</b> <b>crossovers,</b> and determining estimated recombination fractions for all pairs of markers. The re-ordering of markers and replacing genotypes at <b>double</b> <b>crossovers</b> with missing values resulted in an overall decrease in the length of the maps. Fewer apparent genotyping errors, associated with the presence of double recombinants, were identified with restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) than with other types of markers used in this study. The complications that translocations may cause in the ordering of markers and subsequent QTL analysis were investigated. QTL analysis using both the original and revised maps indicated that QTL peaks were more sharply located or had improved log-likelihood (LOD) scores in the revised maps. An accurate indication of the QTL peak and a significant LOD score are both essential for the identification of markers suitable for marker-assisted selection. Recommendations are provided for the improvement of the quality of linkage maps...|$|R
