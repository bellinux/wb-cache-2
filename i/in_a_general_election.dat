5|$|A Non-constituency Member of Parliament ("NCMP") is a {{candidate}} of an opposition political party who, despite having lost <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election,</b> is declared elected as a Member of the Parliament of Singapore ("MP") by virtue of provisions in the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act enabling the unsuccessful candidates who have performed the best to be accorded the status. The MP is so called {{because he or she}} does not represent any constituency (or electoral division) in Parliament.|$|E
5|$|A second {{conflict}} emerged {{just before}} the end of his term, when in 1945, the Labour government sought to abolish the country quota, a system that gave additional electoral seats in rural areas. Farming groups – predominantly National-supporting – strongly opposed the move, and argued that such a major change could only be made after gaining approval <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election.</b> Newall sympathised, and advised Fraser to wait until after the election, but did not feel it was appropriate to intervene; he assented to the bill.|$|E
5|$|At {{the general}} {{election}} on 17 September 2006 the Alliance for Sweden won {{a majority of the}} votes after the first count, defeating the Social Democratic Party. The Moderates gained 26.1 percent of the votes, a new record for the party and over 10 percentage points higher than in 2002. The election result was also historic in being the worst result for the Social Democrats ever (34.6 percent) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election</b> under universal suffrage (introduced in 1921).|$|E

5|$|In May 1965 the Rhodesian Front {{government}} went to {{the country}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election</b> with Van der Byl {{one of the leading}} campaigners. Discussion of unilaterally declaring independence had already begun. Van der Byl argued that {{only a small fraction of}} Rhodesian business opposed it; however, his campaign speeches typically included an argument against business involvement in politics. He cited Johannesburg mining interests' support for the Progressive Party in South Africa, big business support for the Nazi Party in Germany, and the Bolshevik revolution in Russia being financed by United States big business.|$|E
5|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} of 2002 the Moderate Party gained 15.3 percent of the votes—its lowest share of the vote <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election</b> since 1973. Following the loss, Lundgren {{was forced to resign}} his position as leader of the Moderate Party. After the 2002 election Reinfeldt was elected as leader of the Moderate Party parliamentary group, spokesman for economic policy and vice chairman of the parliament's finance committee. On 25 October 2003 he was unanimously elected as the new leader of the Moderate Party.|$|E

5|$|A Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) is {{a member}} of a Singaporean {{opposition}} political party who, according to the Constitution and Parliamentary Elections Act, is declared to have been elected a Member of the Parliament of Singapore despite having lost <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election</b> by virtue of having been one of the best-performing losers. NCMPs enjoy most of the privileges of ordinary Members of Parliament. They are, however, not allowed to vote on several types of bills such as bills to amend the Constitution and motions of no confidence in the Government. An election candidate who has been offered an NCMP seat may decline to take it up.|$|E
5|$|In August 1867, the new nation's first general {{election}} was held; Macdonald's party won easily, with strong support in both large provinces, {{and a majority}} from New Brunswick. Parliament convened in November, surprisingly without Brown, who was defeated in Ontario and never served {{as a member of}} the House of Commons of Canada. By 1869, Nova Scotia had agreed to remain part of Canada after a promise of better financial terms—the first of many provinces to negotiate concessions from Ottawa. Pressure from London and Ottawa failed to gain the accession of Newfoundland, whose voters rejected a Confederation platform <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election</b> in October 1869.|$|E
5|$|In July 1857, Macdonald {{departed}} for Britain to promote Canadian government projects. On {{his return to}} Canada, he was appointed premier {{in place of the}} retiring Taché, just in time to lead the Conservatives <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election.</b> Macdonald was elected in Kingston by 1,189votes to 9 for John Shaw, who was subsequently hanged in effigy; other Conservatives, however, did badly in Canada West, and only French-Canadian support kept Macdonald in power. On 28 December, Isabella Macdonald died, leaving John A. Macdonald a widower with a seven-year-old son. Hugh John Macdonald would be principally raised by his paternal aunt and her husband.|$|E

5|$|Since its inception, {{the scheme}} {{has been widely}} criticised. It has been {{considered}} undemocratic as it allows candidates {{who do not have}} the mandate of the people to air their views in Parliament. Furthermore, members of the opposition have criticized the scheme for creating an unequal playing field <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election</b> by enabling the ruling People's Action Party (PAP) to argue that the electorate need not vote for opposition candidates as there will already be some opposition representation in Parliament. Despite this critique, several opposition politicians have accepted NCMP seats, including Lee Siew-Choh, J. B. Jeyaretnam, Steve Chia and Sylvia Lim. NCMPs have raised notable points in Parliament with regards to various public policy issues such as criminal procedure, education, health and social welfare.|$|E
5|$|Still {{opposed to}} the return of Constantine I and Crown Prince George, the {{government}} of Eleftherios Venizelos offered the throne to Constantine's third son, Prince Paul, who refused to ascend the throne before his father and older brother unless a referendum named him head of state. Only days after Alexander's death, however, Venizelos was defeated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election.</b> On 17 November, Admiral Pavlos Kountouriotis, regent {{since the death of}} Alexander, retired and the new prime minister, Dimitrios Rallis, asked Olga to assume the regency. She served as regent for about a month until her son Constantine returned to the throne on 19 December after a referendum in his favor.|$|E
5|$|On March31 {{the insurgents}} kept their {{part of the}} {{agreement}} by allowing the supply bill to be passed on second reading and the budget to be hoisted for ninety days. However, when the cabinet introduced its promised bill, the insurgents claimed {{that it was not}} as agreed and refused to support it. Instead, they demanded Aberhart's resignation and announced that they were prepared to take over the government within 24hours. A delegation put this demand to Aberhart in the evening of March31; according to them, he agreed to resign if they allowed the supply bill to pass a third reading. They did so, but Aberhart denied that he had agreed to resign and refused to do so unless he was defeated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> <b>election.</b> The insurgents, leery of Aberhart's oratorical powers and the reach of his weekly radio show, wanted to avoid an election. Even so, they rejected a motion by Low to raise their pay for the session by $200, seeing it as a crass bribe.|$|E
