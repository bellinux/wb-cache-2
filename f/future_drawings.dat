40|$|Abstract: Computer Aided Design (CAD) {{packages}} are normally bought off-the-shelf {{for a wide}} range of engineering disciplines. However, a single system cannot possibly meet requirements of different users as these {{packages are}} normally provided with basic primitives but no blocks for quick generations. A case study carried out at a power enterprise in Zimbabwe revealed delays in attending to faults and installations at their substations partly because of delays in the provision of working drawings. Although the company migrated from manual to CAD drawings, the techniques they employed resulted in duplications and delays. An in-house software development strategy was employed in this research to customize their AutoCAD software through an industrial engineering approach aimed at lowering man-hours by generating and storing symbols of their equipment for retrieval and use in <b>future</b> <b>drawings,</b> resulting in lead time reductions and integration with their maintenance management system to avoid duplication of tasks and information...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} of why individuals participate in gambling activities has been puzzling to economists at least since Friedman and Savage (1948). The increase in state-run lotteries {{in recent years has}} reopened this issue alongside the issue of whether lotteries exploit consumers. This paper addresses the {{question of}} whether lotteries are exploitive by connecting it to the {{question of why}} people play at all. I use two large new datasets on a lotto game (the Powerball lottery) to analyze lottery behavior in detail and provide insight into the validity of three existing theories about lottery play. This paper reveals four new facts about the lottery. First, sales increase more with increases in jackpot in richer areas. Second, sales increase more with increases in jackpot size when the odds of winning are better. Third, sales vary systematically over days of the week and time of the year. Fourth, people will purchase tickets for <b>future</b> <b>drawings</b> when they are available. The facts are most strongly consistent with the idea of an additive utility of lottery gambling. This result suggests that state-run lotteries are actually providing utility to consumers and concerns about exploitation ar...|$|E

40|$|Although the {{depiction}} of a child leading a blind man is the most enduring image of onchocerciasis in Africa, research activities have hardly involved children. This paper aims at giving voice to children through drawings and their interpretation. The {{study was conducted in}} 2009 in Cameroon, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Nigeria and Uganda. Children aged 6 – 16 years were asked to draw their perceptions of onchocerciasis and community-directed treatment with ivermectin (CDTI) in their communities. A total of 50 drawings were generated. The drawings depicted four main aspects of onchocerciasis: (1) the disease symptoms, (2) the negative consequences of onchocerciasis among children and in the community generally, (3) the ivermectin distribution process, and (4) the benefits or effects of taking ivermectin. Out of the 50 drawings, 30 were on symptoms, 7 on effects of the disease on children, 8 on distribution process, and 5 represented multiple perceptions on symptoms, drug distribution processes, benefits, and effects of treatment. The lack of clarity when treatment with ivermectin can be stopped in endemic areas requires working with children to ensure continued compliance with treatment into the <b>future.</b> Children's <b>drawings</b> should be incorporated into health education interventions...|$|R
40|$|This study {{introduces}} geometric {{relations as}} a framework for design conceptualiza-tion-its key premise is that nothing is more fundamental in design than formation and discovery of relationships. The study attempts to establish a formal model {{for the development of a}} dynamic computer based graphic environment for design conceptualization that can recognize, record and maintain geometric design relations, merge “depictive” and “propositional”, explicit and implicit in design, and provide a qualitatively different way to explore shape, dimension, and geometric organization. The study presents an approach to this task of formalization, and explores some of the fundamental issues pertinent to the subject, such as computability and applicability to the task of designing.   Specifically, the study explores a relational description of shapes based on the concept of regulating or construction lines as an explicit formulation of a strategy to form generation and creative discovery, and proposes a lexicon of geometric relations to serve as a basis for composition. It hypothesizes that the construction lines can become much more useful and interesting when they are used not just as a rigid skeleton, but to regulate the behaviour of a drawing and to maintain its essential structure as its parts are manipulated. As a consequence, designers could structure the behaviour of the object being designed under <b>future</b> transformations, <b>drawings</b> could become seman-tically charged and could be manipulated in a semantically sophisticated fashion.   The first chapter places the issue in the broader context by arguing that designers form implicit relational models of their designs. This contention is supported by introducing some of the relevant literature on mental imagery. Second chapter introduces design relations and in particular geometric relations, as a focal point of this study. A dynamic computer -based graphic context for design conceptualization is presented and evalu-ated in the next two chapters and conclusions are drawn. In the third chapter, the model's computability is demonstrated and evaluated through ReDRAW, a limited implementation of a relations based graphic system. In the fourth chapter, the model's applicability in design conceptualization is discussed and supported by examples...|$|R
40|$|The Bingo game is {{well known}} and played all over the world. Its main feature is the {{sequential}} drawing without repetition {{of a set of}} numbers. Each of these numbers is compared to the numbers contained in the boxes printed on the different rows (and columns) of the score-cards owned by the Bingo participants. The winner will be the participant that firstly is able to check all the boxes (numbers) into a row (Line) or into the entire score-card (Bingo). Assuming that the score-card has a predetermined purchase price and that the jackpot is divided into two shares, respectively for the Bingo and the Line winner, it is evident that all the score-cards show the same starting value (initial price). After each drawing, every score-card will have different values (current price(s)) according with its probability to gain the Line and/or the Bingo. This probability depends from the number of checked boxes in the rows of the score-card and from the number of checked boxes in the rows of all the other playing score-cards. The first aim {{of this paper is to}} provide the base data structure of the problem and to formalize the needed algorithms for the initial price and current price calculation. The procedure will evaluate the single score-card and/or the whole set of playing score-cards according to the results of the subsequent drawings. In fact, during the game development and after each drawing, it will be possible to know the value of each score-card in order to choose if maintain it or sell it out. The evaluation will work in accordance to the traditional Galilee's method of "the interrupted game jackpot repartition". This approach has been also mentioned by Blaise Pascal and Pierre de Fermat in their mail exchange about the "jackpot problem". More advanced objective of the paper would be the application of the stock exchange techniques for the calculation of the future price of the score-card (and/or of a set of score-cards) that will have some checked numbers after a certain number of <b>future</b> <b>drawings.</b> In the same way will be calculated the value of the right to purchase or sell a score-card (and/or of a set of score-cards) at a pre-determined price (option price). Especially during the prototyping phase, the modelling and the development of these kind of problems need the use of computational environments able to manage structured data and with high calculation skills. The software that meet these requirements are APL, J and Matlab, as for their capability to use nested arrays and for the endogenous parallelism features of the programming environments. In this paper we will show the above mentioned issues through the use of Apl 2 Win/IBM. The formalisation of the game structure has been made in a general way, in order to foresee particular cases that act differently from the Bingo. In this way it is possible to simulate the traditional game with 90 numbers in the basket, 3 rows per 10 columns score-cards, 15 number for the Bingo and 5 numbers for the Line but already, for example, the Roulette with 37 (or 38) numbers, score-cards with 1 (or more) row and 1 column and Line with just 1 number. bingo, options, futures, gambling, market, evaluation...|$|E

40|$|M. Tech. (Architectural Technology) Abstract: A {{memorial}} to Main Reef Road. The city of Johannesburg was founded {{with the discovery}} of gold along the gold reef, which runs approximately parallel to Main Reef Road. The foundation of the city of gold is now a forgotten landscape. The miners, who descended deep into the earth's crust to harvest this valuable commodity, are also forgotten. In an attempt to memorialise the foundation of Johannesburg and its ancestors, I dove deeper in understanding the life of a miner. A miner who emerges from the darkness of beneath and submerges back into the darkness. How do they cross the threshold between the underground and the above ground, between darkness and light? A miner navigating through tunnels upon tunnels, darkness within darkness, can be likened to the metaphorical tunnels of the fast-paced lifestyle of the residents of Johannesburg, navigating to and from destinations, never-ending. It is useful to understand the process adopted methodology, before commencing reading this portfolio. This portfolio is a journey of discovery. A journey which started with a literal two day long bus trip along Main Reef Road. We were allowed to soak up the context and reflect on the concepts of mining, infrastructure and memorial. We then generated a series of collages and intuitive drawings mapping our experiences and understanding of Main Reef Road, its past, present and potential <b>future.</b> The <b>drawings</b> were then translated into 3 -dimensional models and CAD drawings which reflect an even richer understanding of the road. The processes up to this point were the generation of a rich conceptual premise, which resulted in the site finding us. By trusting intuition to guide this process we were able to locate ourselves on sites of complete relevance to our themes. Thereafter a series of on-site drawings were generated, where a deeper understanding of context and the potential for architecture were realised. These intuitive drawings informed a 3 -dimensional, physical, model realization of an abstract architecture. The lessons learnt up to this point were then generated into a complete scheme which is deeply rooted in the history of Johannesburg, Main Reef Road, and more specifically, linked to our individual sites. Furthermore, a complete understanding of the scheme can only be achieved through referring to Appendix A (History and Theory Dissertation) ...|$|R
40|$|Grönsöö Manor on {{the island}} of Grönsö {{south-east}} of Enköping was built in the 1610 s. The first garden was probably laid-out in 1622 as an orchard. The Manor is a notable cultural heritage due to its well-preserved corps-de-logi, rich interior collections and grand surroundings. Besides being a representative for aristocratic estates still existing today, Grönsöö is used as a private home, run by the Ehrenheim family since 1820. The park is renowned for its unbroken continuity, but has nonetheless undergone major changes. The structures from the 17 th and 18 th centuries are mainly well preserved whilst many buildings and structures from the 19 th century and early 20 th century have disappeared. This thesis aims to explore the characteristics of the park during the little known period of 1820 - 1925. The Grönsöö archives offer plant lists from 1840 - 1842 written by Reinhold Fredrik von Ehrenheim, as well as a rich autobiographical material written by his grandson Erik von Ehrenheim. These sources were analysed to shed light on structures and plants now gone, but also on the personal use of the garden and park, as well as private motives for preserving Grönsöö for <b>future</b> generations. <b>Drawings</b> and literature have also been analysed so as to understand the progress of the fruit orchards run by Erik's wife Alice von Ehrenheim in the early 1900 s. The study emphasizes that the former family members did not only focus on the imposing structures of the park. Instead, the park was used as an arena where buildings, animals, fences, fruits, flowers, fantasies as well as seasonal changes were important parts. The water, the shore and the islands and islets were all parts of a rich entity for both private use and social events. In comparison with today's park, the memoranda tell a different, intimate and complex story which mirrors the former owners' strong attachments to Grönsöö. The plant lists exhibit hundreds of curious species, many of them imported from Hamburg as brand new ornamental plants at that time. They were the apple of the owner's eyes as well as a significant part of a short-lived garden fashion in the mid nineteenth century. A remarkable garden heritage is the today still ongoing fruit growing, orchards generally being a fading tradition as a commercial crop in this region. Alice von Ehrenheim's modern growing methods and experiences contri-buted not only to Grönsöö's fruit harvest but to national pomological knowledge...|$|R
2500|$|Once {{he lived}} in Florida he began taking photos of large estates {{including}} their grounds, their gardens, their specimen plants, the vistas as seen through their gates and sold them for extra income. The owners often voiced the thought that they wished they could be in color as these were the days before color film or digital cameras. To add color he used cotton twisted on a toothpick dipped in paint. In tinting {{he had to get}} acquainted with artist oils. He saw details of leaves and bark. He saw the natural arrangements of branches and trunks and this made him think about structure. Soon he had made the step from shading photographs to actual painting. His first painting was a canvas of a garden scene with a wall and large vases. It was hung in a Baltimore Show. From that painting forward he made time to paint. It was realistic work, always of plants. His early paintings in 1923 were categorized as [...] "Photographic". From there he began painting his series labeled [...] "Realistic" [...] paintings from 1925 to 1928. An unknown artist friend looked at one of his early efforts and made the comment {{that he did not have}} to paint every leaf. The period of details however survived until 1928 when the paintings became more stylized under the tutelage of Leopold Stokowski. This experience came about when Stokowski, a long-time friend of Mrs. Bovington, then employing Mulford as a landscape architect for her estate, told her he was looking for someone to accompany the family to Europe. Knowing the two individuals, she immediately recommended Mulford who accepted eagerly. Stokowski took him to Switzerland, France and Italy where they spent most of the summer of 1928 in the Alps. Stokowski was eager to see Europe through Mulford's eyes. He viewed life in a different way than Stokowski had experienced before. It was Mulford's great pleasure to explain plant life from his philosophical point of view. Stokowski was the disciplinarian for Mulford. He required a painting every day from him. It was almost by the demand of Stokowski that Mulford created over forty impressions of his experience that summer, the major portions being the French Alps in and around Haute Savoir. These paintings were compiled in a book Stokowski Sees that was privately printed but not published and the book is currently held by Michael Spencer who is still deciding on its <b>future,</b> although many <b>drawings</b> and paintings are held by family members from this era and his memories are recollected in memoir accounts. After his return from Europe he continued to paint with his newfound skills and outlook.|$|R

The study {{investigated}} the effect of using projective narratives and drawings that depict diminished fear, on the anxiety levels {{of a group of}} children living in children’s homes, by means of a mixed methodology. The sample consisted of 30 middle childhood children (mean age = 9. 60 years, SD = 1. 13) from three children’s homes in the Western Cape. Drawings were used to elicit content of fear or anxiety (anxiety evoking drawing/bangmaaktekening) and proposed coping (anxiety lessening drawing/bangwegvattekening). After completing the anxiety provoking drawing, participants in the experimental group were asked to tell a story to other children with a similar fear to lessen/take that fear away (projective narrative). The Spence Childhood Anxiety Scale (SCAS) was completed after each drawing, and drawings evaluated through the use of anxiety scales, to measure changes in anxiety levels according to the concept of triangulation. The categories ghosts, snakes, and people were found to be the most prevalent content of fear from anxiety provoking drawings, and undifferentiated fears were also common within this population. Control of anxiety from anxiety lessening drawings indicated a definite prevalence of emotion focused (secondary) coping strategies, specifically religious solace. The content of projective narratives echoed this finding, although proposed solutions were more differentiated. Ownership of projections also occurred. The experimental effect was not significant, although mean anxiety levels were considerably lower in the drawings in comparison with that of the SCAS. Drawings are thus seen as an effective, nonthreatening technique to study anxiety phenomena. A comparison of the mean item scores of the SCAS subscales indicated that symptoms of separation anxiety, generalised anxiety disorder, and obsessivecompulsive anxiety disorder were prevalent among this group of children in children’s homes. A clear distinction was found between markers of state- and trait-anxiety through the qualitative analysis of the drawings, with anxiety lessening drawings showing definite diminished state-anxiety, although more established markers of trait-anxiety did not necessarily change. There are also indications that transference of activated negative emotional stimuli occurred on an unconscious level between the two drawings. Introducing the combination of projective narratives in the intervention stage of the study appeared to facilitate learning or the experience of observed positive affect in anxiety lessened <b>drawings.</b> <b>Future</b> research would benefit from including a normative group to establish more clear markers of state- and trait-anxiety in drawings, and by the use of a bigger sample to investigate factor loadings of the SCAS among children in children’s homes. The high prevalence of anxiety symptoms in this population emphasises their status as a vulnerable population, and the need for possible group intervention – specifically the psycho-education of effective coping strategies for anxiety...|$|R
