50|$|An <b>exploded</b> <b>view</b> <b>drawing</b> is a diagram, picture, {{schematic}} {{or technical}} drawing of an object, {{that shows the}} relationship or order of assembly of various parts.|$|E
5000|$|Assembly {{drawings}} {{show how}} different parts go together, identify those parts by number, {{and have a}} parts list, {{often referred to as}} a bill of materials. [...] In a technical service manual, this type of drawing may be referred to as an <b>exploded</b> <b>view</b> <b>drawing</b> or diagram.These parts may be used in engineering.|$|E
50|$|Usually, the {{projection}} of an exploded view is normally shown from above and slightly in diagonal from {{the left or right}} side of the drawing.

50|$|An <b>exploded</b> <b>view</b> <b>drawing</b> {{is a type}} of drawing, {{that shows}} the {{intended}} assembly of mechanical or other parts.

5000|$|Engineering {{practice}} makes {{a distinction}} between [...] "mathematical models" [...] and [...] "physical models"; the cost of fabricating a physical model can be minimized by first creating a mathematical model using a computer software package, such as a computer aided design tool. The component parts are each themselves modelled, and the fabrication tolerances are specified. An <b>exploded</b> <b>view</b> <b>drawing</b> is used {{to lay out the}} fabrication sequence. Simulation packages for displaying each of the subassemblies allow the parts to be rotated, magnified, in realistic detail. Software packages for creating the bill of materials for construction allows subcontractors to specialize in assembly processes, which spreads the cost of manufacturing machinery among multiple customers.

40|$|Taking things apart is easy. How {{something}} works, or {{even what}} it is, {{is irrelevant to}} its dismantling. If assembly can {{be perceived as a}} rational act, then disassembly is certainly its counterpart: an intuitive, foolproof, and mindless errand of the seemingly curious subject. It is in this unflattering description, however, that disassembly warrants an analysis of its smart potential Smart Disassemblies locates the <b>exploded</b> <b>view</b> <b>drawing,</b> a representation that conveys the instructions for assembly, within its architectural legacy, from its origins in the Renaissance to its more contemporary appropriation by Thom Mayne and Daniel Libeskind. The categorical rules, and the part-to-whole relationships they imply, gleaned from these precedents are then subverted toward the end of disassembling an object. The proposed rule sets (Point of Explosion, Point of View, and Explosion Sequence) and their variants are tested through their application to a complex assembly of objects, a jazz quintet...|$|E

40|$|Figure 1 : Compact Explosion Diagrams. The entire {{assemblies}} {{are demonstrated}} {{by a set}} of representative <b>exploded</b> <b>views.</b> Our system automatically detects recurring subassemblies before it computes the one which represents the composition best. This paper presents a system to automatically generate compact ex-plosion diagrams. Inspired by handmade illustrations, our approach reduces the complexity of an explosion diagram by rendering an ex-ploded view only for a subset of the assemblies of an object. How-ever, the <b>exploded</b> <b>views</b> are chosen so that they allow inference of the remaining unexploded assemblies of the entire 3 D model. In particular, our approach demonstrates the assembly of a set of identical groups of parts, by presenting an <b>exploded</b> <b>view</b> only for a single representative. In order to identify the representatives, our system automatically searches for recurring subassemblies. It se-lects representatives depending on a quality evaluation of their po-tential <b>exploded</b> <b>view.</b> Our system takes into account visibility in...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Exploded</b> <b>views</b> {{are often}} used in {{illustration}} to overcome the problem of occlusion when depicting complex structures. In this paper, we propose a volume visualization technique inspired by <b>exploded</b> <b>views</b> that partitions the volume {{into a number of}} parallel slabs and shows them apart from each other. The thickness of slabs is driven by the similarity between partitions. We use an information-theoretic technique for the generation of <b>exploded</b> <b>views.</b> First, the algorithm identifies the viewpoint which gives the most structured view of the data. Then, the partition of the volume into the most informative slabs for exploding is obtained using two complementary similarity-based strategies. The number of slabs and the similarity parameter are freely adjustable by the user. ...|$|R
