5|$|As {{a result}} of this discovery, the {{condition}} became known as trisomy21. Even before the discovery of its cause, the presence of the syndrome in all races, its association with older maternal age, and its rarity of recurrence had been noticed.

5|$|Asperger {{syndrome}} {{appears to}} result from developmental <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> affect many or all functional brain systems, as opposed to localized effects. Although the specific underpinnings of AS or <b>factors</b> <b>that</b> distinguish it from other ASDs are unknown, and no clear pathology common to individuals with AS has emerged, {{it is still possible}} that AS's mechanism is separate from other ASDs. Neuroanatomical studies and the associations with teratogens strongly suggest that the mechanism includes alteration of brain development soon after conception. Abnormal migration of embryonic cells during fetal development may affect the final structure and connectivity of the brain, resulting in alterations in the neural circuits that control thought and behavior. Several theories of mechanism are available; none are likely to provide a complete explanation.|$|E
