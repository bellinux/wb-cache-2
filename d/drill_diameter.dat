50|$|In {{computer}} {{numerical control}} (CNC) machine tools a process called , or interrupted cut drilling, is used to keep swarf from detrimentally building up when drilling deep holes (approximately when {{the depth of the}} hole is three times greater than the <b>drill</b> <b>diameter).</b> Peck drilling involves plunging the drill part way through the workpiece, no more than five times the diameter of the drill, and then retracting it to the surface. This is repeated until the hole is finished. A modified form of this process, called high speed peck drilling or chip breaking, only retracts the drill slightly. This process is faster, but is only used in moderately long holes, otherwise it will overheat the drill bit. It is also used when drilling stringy material to break the chips.|$|E
5000|$|The {{geometry}} {{of a hole}} drilled in metal by a twist drill may not be accurate enough (close enough to a true cylinder of a certain precise diameter) and {{may not have the}} required smooth surface finish for certain engineering applications. Although modern twist drills can perform excellently in many cases—usually producing sufficiently accurate holes for most applications—sometimes the stringency of the requirements for the hole's geometry and finish necessitate two operations: a drilling to slightly undersize, followed by reaming with a reamer. The planned difference between the <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> and the reamer diameter is called an allowance. (It allows for the removal of a certain small amount of material.) The allowance should be < 0.2 mm (.008 in) for soft materials and < 0.13 mm (.005 in) for hard materials. Larger allowances can damage the reamer. The drilled hole should not be enlarged by more than 5% of the drilled diameter. Drilling followed by reaming generally produces hole geometry and finish that is as close to theoretical perfection as possible. (The other methods of hole creation that approach nearest to perfection under certain conditions are boring single-point boring and internal cylindrical grinding.) ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{straight}} shank {{is the most}} usual style on modern drill bits, by number manufactured. The whole of the drill bit, shaft and shank, is usually of the same diameter. It is held usually in a 3-jaw drill chuck. Bits of diameter too small to grip firmly can have {{straight shank}}s of larger diameter than the drill, which can be held firmly in a standard size colet or chuck. Large drill bits can have straight shanks narrower than the <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> {{so that they can}} be fitted in chucks not able to chuck the full diameter. Such a drill bit is called a reduced-shank or blacksmith's drill. For example, this allows a 1/2" [...] bit to be used in a pistol-grip drill's 3/8" [...] chuck. One particular type of reduced-shank drill bits are Silver & Deming (S&D) bits, whose sets run from 9/16" [...] to 1-1/2" [...] drill body diameter with a standard 1/2" [...] reduced shank for all. This allows drill presses with 1/2" [...] chucks to run the larger drills. S&D bits are 6" [...] long with a 3" [...] flute length.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{investigate}} the influence of different implant placement techniques on the early bone healing response in an animal model. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In the present study, 24 cylindrical-screw-type implants with a diameter of 4. 2 mm (Dyna(R)) were installed, using three different surgical techniques; (1) 5 % undersized, using a final <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> of 4 mm; (2) 15 % undersized, using a final <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> of 3. 6 mm; and (3) 25 % undersized, using a final <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> of 3. 2 mm. After 3 weeks of implantation period, the peri-implant bone response was histologically evaluated and the percentage of bone-implant contact (%BIC) calculated. RESULTS: New bone formation was more pronounced for implants placed with the 5 % undersized or 15 % undersized technique, as compared with implants installed with the 25 % undersized technique. Histomorphometrical data corroborates these findings as the %BIC was significantly higher for implants inserted with the 5 % undersized (47. 7 +/- 11. 1) or 15 % undersized protocol (47. 5 +/- 9. 5) as compared with implants inserted with the 25 % undersized technique (32. 1 +/- 9. 7). No significant difference in %BIC could be observed between the 5 % undersized and 15 % undersized installed implants. CONCLUSION: Within the limitation of the present study, it was concluded that excessive compression of the host bone, when a discrepancy between implant and final <b>drill</b> <b>diameter</b> more than 15 %, can result in an inferior tissue response in the early stage of healing. To compare research results in the future, it is advised to specify the term "undersized" by mentioning the real reduction in diameter...|$|E

The surface dimensions of the atlas vertebra and the transoral approach for odontoidectomy have been described in detail. Anterior arcus of C 1 must be drilled out to reach odontoid process for transoral odontoidectomy. The thickness of anterior ring of C 1 has not been studied before. Sixty, dried adult atlas and 60 axis vertebrae and ten cadaveric craniocervical specimens were measured for the following: (1) bony drilling depth (BDD), {{the distance from the}} anterior wall of anterior ring of C 1 to anterior wall of odontoid; (2) minimum <b>drilling</b> <b>diameter</b> (MDD), distance of minimum C 1 anterior ring removal for odontoid resection on horizontal plane; (3) maximum bony <b>drilling</b> <b>diameter</b> (MBDD), distance of maximum C 1 anterior ring removal for odontoid resection on horizontal plane. Lateral border of this diameter is limited by medial borders of the lateral mass; (4) the widest odontoid diameters (WOD) on coronal sections were measured. On 60 atlas and axis vertebrae, the BDD was 7. 0  ±  1. 2  mm on dry bones, the distance between the medial borders of the lateral mass (MBDD) was 16. 1  ±  1. 5  mm, and the WOD on coronal sections (WOD) was 9. 8  ±  0. 8  mm.

30|$|Generally, the <b>drilling</b> <b>diameter</b> is 100 ~ 300  mm (Zhao and Dai 2007). Among all GSHP {{vertical}} ground heat exchangers, u-tubes, annular {{tubes and}} single tubes are most commonly used. The U-tube is most common {{due to its}} simple construction, good heat exchanger performance, high bearing, less tube joints, and unlikely leakage. The U-type side tube spacing is small due to restraints imposed on the well <b>drilling</b> <b>diameter.</b> Due {{to the existence of}} temperature differences, heat conduction will occur directly between the two side-tubes, interfering with the ability of the soil to function as an effective heat sink. Thermal interference seriously influences the underground heat exchange of U-type tubes, decreasing the quantity of heat rejection for unit well depth by 20 – 40  %. More seriously, it will lead to a malfunction of the heat pump refrigerant-cycle system, which can stop operation. It was found that increasing the pipe spacing, applying high thermal conductivity backfill soil can enhance the performace of GSHP systems (Dehkordi and Schincariol 2014). Shen (2007) uses a finite unit method to perform quantitative analyses on the hystereses caused by thermal interference. Carli (2010) analyzed the thermal interference in the drill holes by calculating the heat resistance, which makes uses an electrical analogy with lumped capacitances. These thermal resistances were used to solve for the heat transfer in an unsteady state. For the vertical double U-type ground tube, although the quantity of heat exchange for a unit well depth is larger than the single U-type tube, for the same drilling area, thermal interference is more likely to happen because the temperature of several side-tubes is different. The rock-soil’s heat equilibrium temperature not only affects the underground rock-soil heat transfer rate, but is also associated with normal operation and economy of heat pump systems. An ideal temperature range ensures efficient running of the system. In addition, appropriate side-tube spacing not can enhance the heat exchanger efficiency but also can reduce the required <b>drilling</b> <b>diameter.</b> Therefore, this paper establishes a three-dimensional heat transfer model for a single-well, double-U buried tube based on the rock-soil thermophysical properties. It also accounts for vertical temperature stratification according to underground heat transfer test experiment conditions, and carried out comparison of simulation results for soil temperature and U-tube water temperature are compared for single U-type buried pipes and a double-U buried pipes for continuous operation over 7  days. After that, the paper compares the outlet water temperature changes during the time of continuous operation and intermittent operation for a double-U heat exchanger. Eventually, the double-U buried pipe model was established of different side-tube center distance. Thermal interference arising from temperature distribution variation for different side-tubes was also analyzed.|$|R
