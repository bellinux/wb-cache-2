50|$|With {{the slogan}} “The challenger“, the HATZ 1B-series was {{presented}} in 1996, showing a number of technical highlights. In a minimum of space, all the important functional components of the engine such as decompression device, injection pump drive, oil pump with oil pump pressure regulator, valve train system for inlet and outlet valve, governor, speed control lever with <b>governor</b> <b>spring</b> and the multi-functional mechanical control system are integrated in the governor housing. Due to these technical features, the B-series scores with a light-weight and compact design.Depending on their cylinder capacity, the air-cooled one-cylinder diesel engines of B-series are available at power ranges from 1.5 to 7.6 kW and a maximum speed of 3600 rpm. Furthermore, models with vertical or horizontal crankshaft are available. The B-series complies with the strict requirements of EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) Tier IV final in the US.|$|E

50|$|On May 8, 1903, Gov. William W. Heard {{issued a}} {{proclamation}} incorporating {{the village of}} Denham <b>Springs.</b> <b>Governor</b> Huey Long designated Denham Springs as a town on February 5, 1929 and lt. Gov.

5000|$|In 1959, Rayburn {{acted as}} a {{lieutenant}} for Earl Long and helped to get the <b>governor</b> <b>sprung</b> from a mental institution {{where he had been}} confined by his wife, Blanche R. Long. Ironically, it was Jesse Bankston, later the longtime Democratic Party state chairman, who had signed the original commitment papers because he thought that he was acting in his friend Long's best interest. Rayburn, however, remained loyal to Long even as family members, concerned about the governor's drinking and public relationships with Bourbon Street strippers, had Bankston, then the state director of hospitals, commit Long to Southeast Louisiana Hospital in Mandeville. With Rayburn's help, Long famously worked from his hospital bed to fire Bankston and then get released. Upon Rayburn's death, Bankston said that the veteran lawmaker had excelled in speechmaking but was also strong on Democratic issues involving education and labor. The two had long since reconciled their differences over Long's hospitalization. Former Senate secretary Mike Baer, himself a native of Rayburn's Bogalusa, declared the former lawmaker the [...] "last of the Red Hot Poppas," [...] a term that Earl Long had applied to himself in the 1950s to refer to politicians traveling from one community to another with sound trucks for stump speaking, rather than reliance on slick television advertising. Baer noted that Rayburn could stop a bill by making a familiar argument that the proposed law would [...] "hurt the poor people[...] [...] [...] Even the author of a bill withdrew it or voted against his own bill after Sixty spoke against it." ...|$|R
50|$|His {{final two}} years as {{governor}} were marred with jurisdictional issues from the crown, and following the threat of impeachment, he resigned as <b>governor</b> in the <b>spring</b> of 1698, being succeeded by his nephew, Samuel Cranston. Always with public service in his heart, he nevertheless became deputy governor of the colony in 1700, and served in this capacity every year {{until his death in}} 1714.|$|R
50|$|In {{his last}} days as <b>governor</b> in the <b>spring</b> of 1972, McKeithen spoke before the AFL-CIO convention. He {{credited}} union president Victor Bussie with having {{helped him to}} achieve what McKeithen considered the landmarks of his tenure in office: industrial expansion, improved race relations, prison reform, and increases in the pay of teachers and state employees. The latter required an unpopular increase in 1970 from 2 to 3 cents in the state sales tax.|$|R
50|$|Roger Williams {{fled the}} Massachusetts Bay Colony to avoid arrest and {{deportation}} and stayed {{the winter of}} 1635-36 with Massasoit, who gave him land along the Seekonk River the following <b>spring.</b> <b>Governor</b> Winslow of Plymouth Colony advised Williams to move his settlement {{to the other side}} of the river because his current location was within the bounds of Plymouth Colony. Williams did so and founded Providence Plantation which later became the state of Rhode Island.|$|R
50|$|Oddly enough, Emperor Xuan {{believed}} that he could seize part of Northern Qi territory after Northern Zhou's victory, and he sent Wu Mingche to again advance north. In winter 577, Wu put Pengcheng (彭城, in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu) under siege, and Emperor Xuan was confident that Wu would {{soon be able to}} capture the region south of the Yellow River. When the official Cai Jingli (蔡景歷) warned otherwise, he was so displeased that he demoted Cai to the post of a commandery <b>governor.</b> In <b>spring</b> 578, the Northern Zhou general Wang Gui (王軌) thoroughly crushed Wu, capturing him. Regretting his actions, Emperor Xuan recalled Cai to the capital. With the people's hearts shaken by the great defeat, in fall 578, Emperor Xuan held a ceremony in which the officials reaffirmed their loyalty to the state.|$|R

5000|$|He began {{purchasing}} land in Cass County (now Bartow), Georgia in 1838 {{and built}} a sizable plantation of over 2,500 acres which was called [...] "Etowah Valley". He served as postmaster for Etowah Valley from 1841-1845. In 1843, he purchased 2,440 additional acres in Cass County (Bartow) about 9.5 miles northeast of his plantation and, built the most exclusive resort {{in the state of}} Georgia, Rowland <b>Springs.</b> <b>Governor</b> and Mrs. Joseph E. Brown were frequent guests there and four state governors vacationed there in one season. Renowned physician, scientist, conservationist, and educator, Joseph LeConte honeymooned at Rowland Springs in 1846. William Gilmore Simms, Southern poet, novelist, and historian, even mentions Rowland Springs in one of his works.|$|R
50|$|In 1924, the Fund convened an Advisory Committee on {{education}} in Liberia led by James Sibley, a strong {{proponent of the}} Booker Washingt{{on education}} philosophy. The Committee concluded {{that most of the}} work conducted by religious missions was superficial and lacked contact with the community. Sibley later organized a Teacher lecture series that was attended by 95% of teachers in Liberia and ultimately persuaded the government to contribute money towards publication of textbooks adapted to Liberian and West African conditions. In 1927, Sibley organized the Association of Jeanes Teachers for Liberia which supported the much-needed expansion of the Methodist Episcopal's St. Paul River Industrial Institute and changed its name to the Booker Washington Institute. In late 1927, the Liberian Legislature granted a charter to the Association to incorporate the Booker T. Washington Agricultural and Industrial Institute. At the same time, Ms. Olivia Egleston Phelps Stokes, whose bequest established the Phelps Stokes Fund, provided significant financial support to the newly established Booker Washington Institute, and the fund has continued to work with the institute. Phelps Stokes President Badi Foster accepted appointment to the BWI Board of <b>Governors</b> in <b>spring</b> 2008.|$|R
50|$|Harris was {{considered}} a favorite to win the 2002 race for governor of Hawai'i. However, high-level Democratic Party insiders who had backed fellow Democrats against Harris in 1994, 1996, and 2000, {{did not want to}} relinquish the Governorship and Party leadership to this independent Democrat, and thus fought against his candidacy, beginning with a public campaign demanding Harris resign from being Mayor if he intended to run for <b>Governor.</b> In the <b>spring</b> of 2002, local news media reported unfounded and unproven allegations, of campaign finance wrongdoing by some of Harris' staffers. Despite polling closely to presumptive Republican nominee Linda Lingle, Harris bowed out of the gubernatorial race. Hawai'i Democratic leaders then backed incumbent Lieutenant Governor Mazie Hirono, a favorite of Sen. Dan Inouye, for the nomination instead.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the Tang {{imperial}} government, {{which was}} also weary of the developments at Huainan Circuit, had commissioned Zhu Quanzhong the military governor of Xuanwu Circuit (宣武, headquartered in modern Kaifeng, Henan) the military governor of Huainan as well. Zhu {{announced that he was}} making Yang Xingmi deputy military governor, while announcing his own officer Li Fan (李璠) as acting military governor. He sent his advisor Zhang Yanfan (張延範) to Yang Prefecture to convey his good will and decisions to Yang Xingmi. Yang Xingmi initially welcomed Zhang, but upon hearing that Zhu was sending Li Fan as acting military governor, turned angry. Zhang, in fear, fled back to Xuanwu. Meanwhile, Li Fan, on his way south, was ambushed by Shi Pu the military governor of Ganhua Circuit (感化, headquartered in modern Xuzhou, Jiangsu), who was angry that Zhu, not he, was given Huainan. With both Yang Xingmi and Shi turning against him, Zhu abandoned his plans of taking control of Huainan. He subsequently recommended to the imperial government that Yang be made acting military <b>governor.</b> In <b>spring</b> 888, Sun (who by this point had put Qin Yan and Bi to death and taken over their forces) finally attacked Yang Prefecture, capturing it easily. Sun claimed the title of military governor. Yang Xingmi fled, and per Yuan's suggestion, returned to Lu Prefecture to prepare his next step.|$|R
50|$|In 1753, {{three years}} into Father Le Loutre's War, John Creighton led {{the group of}} Foreign Protestants {{stationed}} in Halifax to resettle Mirliguèche, naming the new British colony Lunenburg. The town was named in honour of the King of Great Britain and Ireland, George August of Hanover, who was also the duke of Braunschweig-Lüneburg. Like Halifax, the British established Lunenburg unilaterally, that is, without negotiating with the Mi'kmaq, whose sovereign territory it had always been. In the <b>spring,</b> <b>Governor</b> Hopson received warnings from Fort Edward {{that as many as}} 300 natives nearby were prepared to oppose the settlement of Lunenburg and intended to attack upon the arrival of settlers. On June 7, 1753, supervised by Lawrence, escorted by several ships of the British Navy and accompanied by 160 Regular soldiers, 1,453 Foreign Protestants from Halifax landed at Rous' Brook.|$|R
5000|$|By 1909 no capitol had {{yet been}} {{constructed}} and Governor William Spry, recognizing that Utah {{was one of}} only a few states without a capitol building, sent a proposal to the state legislature asking {{for the creation of a}} new commission to oversee the construction of a capitol. During that year's legislative session the commission was created and efforts made to gain funding for construction. An appropriation bill, which would use a one mill property tax, was produced but failed in a required popular vote that June. Funding options in the form of bonds and loans were also researched. In 1910 the state constitution was amended to allow bonding for the capitol building, and by 1911 a bill authorizing $1,305,000 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) in bonds was presented to the state legislature. The bill passed both houses after the amount was reduced to $1 million (equivalent to $ in [...] )and was signed into law by the <b>governor</b> in <b>Spring</b> 1911. Funds were also boosted when Union Pacific Railroad president, Edward Henry Harriman, died in 1909, and his widow was required to pay a five-percent inheritance tax to the state of Utah. Union Pacific had helped to construct the Transcontinental Railroad, which was completed in Utah, and Harriman had invested $3.5 million in Salt Lake City's electric trolley system. Because of these investments within the state, Mrs. Harriman paid the state treasurer $798,546 (equivalent to $ in [...] ) on March 1, 1911, as required by law.|$|R
50|$|Thomas Eastchurch (? - January, 1678) was {{governor}} of Albemarle County, North Carolina between 1675 and 1676. During his time in office, he imprisoned the former governor John Jenkins for various offenses. Jenkins was later released from prison {{with the aid of}} his supporters and reclaimed his position as <b>governor</b> in the <b>spring</b> of 1676. After Eastchurch explained the situation in London to the Lords Proprietors, they reappointed him as governor. In 1677, he left London to celebrate his honeymoon in Nevis Island. During his absence, his fellow proprietary Thomas Miller acted as governor. Miller's crimes created a revolt and Eastchurch, upon return to Albemarle, was unable to help the government recover. In addition, the Anti-Proprietors' leaders decided to send an army to {{the northern part of the}} Albemarle County to prevent the new governor from accessing Albemarle. Although Eastchurch sought aid to invade the county, he never got it. He did not return to government of Albemarle until after the spring of 1676.|$|R
5000|$|By 825, Niu {{had come}} to the {{conclusion}} that Emperor Jingzong was frivolous and not diligent, and that wicked people around Emperor Jingzong wielded actual power. He did not dare to speak on the issue in fear of bringing disaster on himself, so he repeatedly offered to resign and take a regional <b>governor</b> post. In <b>spring</b> 825, Emperor Jingzong converted Eyue Circuit (鄂岳, headquartered in modern Wuhan, Hubei) to Wuchang Circuit and made Niu the military governor (Jiedushi) of Wuchang, continuing to carry the Tong Zhongshu Menxia Pingzhangshi title as an honorary title. (When he went through Xiangyang, the military governor of Shannan East Circuit (山南東道, headquartered at Xiangyang), Liu Gongchuo (柳公綽), in order to show respect to the central government, as Niu was recently chancellor, paid respect to Niu, over his staff's objection, even though they had the same rank as military governor and Shannan East was considered a circuit with higher precedence than Wuchang.) ...|$|R
5000|$|Sometime after Wu Shaocheng became {{military}} governor (Jiedushi) of Zhaoyi Circuit in 786, he sent gold and silk to Weibo Circuit, requesting {{that he be}} allowed to have Wu Shaoyang. Weibo allowed Wu Shaoyang to report to Zhangyi. Wu Shaocheng claimed that Wu Shaoyang was a cousin, and gave him various commissions; Wu Shaoyang was also given access to Wu Shaocheng's mansion. Still, because Wu Shaocheng was cruel and suspicious, Wu Shaoyang requested a position not at headquarters, and Wu Shaocheng made him the prefect of Shen Prefecture (申州, in modern Xinyang, Henan). It was said that because Wu Shaoyang was lenient, he became favored by the army. [...] When Wu Shaocheng grew ill in 809 and fell unconscious, his servant Xianyu Xiong'er (鮮于熊兒/鲜于熊儿), forged an order in Wu Shaocheng's name recalling Wu Shaoyang to serve as deputy {{military governor}}. Wu Shaoyang put Wu Shaocheng's son Wu Yuanqing (吳元慶/吴元庆) to death and took over the circuit. After Wu Shaocheng died around the new year 810, Wu Shaoyang claimed the title of acting military governor. [...] As then-reigning Emperor Xianzong was already waging a campaign against another warlord, Wang Chengzong, who ruled Chengde Circuit (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), at the time, he felt that he could not act against Wu Shaoyang as well, so he made his son Li You the Prince of Sui the titular military governor of Zhaoyi and gave Wu Shaoyang the title of acting military <b>governor</b> in <b>spring</b> 810. [...] In spring 811, Wu was made military governor.|$|R

5000|$|The D-400 series engine or the Iron Horse {{engine was}} a {{light-duty}} two-stroke engine used for powering lawnmowers {{produced in the}} 1960s to the early 1980s. D-400 engines were single-cylinder engines designed and manufactured by the Outboard Marine Corporation (OMC; Johnson and Evinrude) for Lawn-Boy and Masport. The D-400 engines displaced 109 cc, generated 2.61 kW of power, and operated {{in the range of}} 2400-3300 RPM. The engines have a distinctive rectangular cowling that has created a nickname of Brick-top mowers. Another distinctive feature is the two-finger vertical recoil starter. The kidney-shaped muffler and exhaust unit is mounted beneath the mowers' deck and gives the engine a small, low profile design when compared to the newer and more powerful lawnmower engines. The ignition system employs a magneto, points, and a condenser (capacitor) set-up with an unusual spark-advance system which utilised a weight on the crankshaft to adjust the spark-advance amount depending on engine speed. The <b>sprung</b> <b>governor</b> was also unusual with a throw-yoke which operated under the flywheel and was linked to the throttle. The carburettor was a float design and fed into a pair of reed valves.|$|R
50|$|Stanley Clark, Benjamin Chamberlain, and William Gallagher owned lands {{adjacent}} to the Oil Spring Reservation. On behalf of the three, Clark surveyed Reservation lands and claimed it, granting one-quarter of the reservation to Horatio Seymour, later governor of New York, and in the 1850s, conveying another quarter to Philonius Pattison. In response to these actions, the Seneca began a case which {{ended up in the}} New York Court of Appeals, Seneca Nation of Indians v. Philonus Pattison. A state court case protested Seymour, Gallagher, Chamberlain, and Clark's claims to the northeast quarter of Oil <b>Spring.</b> <b>Governor</b> Blacksnake, who had attended the negotiations of the Treaty of Big Tree, testified that he and Joseph Ellicott had surveyed the Oil Spring lands and the omission of the lands from the treaty was a mistake. He was able to produce a map copied by the Holland Land Company in which the Oil Spring Reservation was marked similarly to other Seneca lands. The case was laid to rest in 1861 when the court found for the Senecas. Pattison, Chamberlain, Clark, Gallagher, and Seymour were forced to leave the reservation. While later incursions by the New York State Board of Canal Commissioners and tourist activities eroded additional land from the Reservation, Governor Blacksnake's actions helped preserve at least some of Oil Spring as Seneca lands.|$|R
5000|$|However, Wang's {{attacks were}} stifled by Chengdu's strong defenses, and his {{supplies}} soon ran low. By summer 888, he considered abandoning the campaign altogether, but after Zhou Xiang and Qiwu Jian convinced him otherwise, continued the campaign. He, believing {{that he needed}} imperial sanction in order {{to succeed in the}} campaign, had Zhou draft a petition for him to Emperor Zhaozong — Emperor Xizong's brother, who succeeded Emperor Xizong after Emperor Xizong died early in 888 — asking to be given the rich Qiong Prefecture while asking the emperor to send a new military governor of Xichuan, offering to assist the new military governor. Gu Yanlang also submitted a petition requesting that Chen be moved from his post. Emperor Zhaozong, who had previous grudges against Tian and Chen for Tian's ill treatment of him while he was an imperial prince, issued an edict summoning Chen back to Chang'an to serve as an imperial guard general, while making the chancellor Wei Zhaodu the new military governor of Xichuan. When Chen subsequently refused the summons, Emperor Zhaozong stripped him of all of his titles and put Wei in charge of the operations against him, with Yang Shouliang, Wang, and Gu assisting him. Emperor Zhaozong also carved out four prefectures from Xichuan and made it into a new Yongping Circuit, with its capital at Qiong, for Wang to serve as military <b>governor.</b> [...] In <b>spring</b> 890, Wang put Qiong Prefecture under siege. Around the same time, Wei arrived in Chengdu's vicinity, and Wang outwardly honored him greatly. A number of prefectures began to submit to Wang, and in winter 890, Qiong fell to him, allowing him to use Qiong as his basis of operations.|$|R
