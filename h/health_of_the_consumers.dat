40|$|Mass {{media reports}} suggest that pangasius (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus) is ‘full of poison’ {{because it is}} able to survive in the ‘heavily {{polluted}} Mekong River’ and contains pesticides and veterinary treatment chemicals. However, most of these claims are not substantiated with scientific evidence. To assess <b>the</b> safety <b>of</b> pangasius consumption, a full toxicological risk assessment was performed. The results obtained were compared to toxicity claims made in a selection of media reports. Information on contaminant levels encountered in pangasius was collected from the EU Rapid Alert System for Food and Feed (RASFF) database. The toxicological risk assessments do not support any <b>of</b> <b>the</b> toxicological risks suggested in the media. Next, the maximum pangasius consumption that would be considered safe was estimated on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> highest levels <b>of</b> <b>the</b> toxic contaminants reported in Vietnamese pangasius by RASFF and the safety thresholds for the contaminants. <b>The</b> maximum amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> recalled fillet that could have been consumed without any adverse effects amounted to between 3. 4 and 166. 7 kg day− 1 (lifelong for a 70 kg adult) in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> pesticide contamination and between 0. 613 and 303 kg fillet day− 1 in <b>the</b> case <b>of</b> preservatives and antibiotics. It is concluded that consumption of pangasius available on the European market does not pose any concern for <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer.</b> <b>The</b> analysis presented in this study illustrates that publicly available independent information could help consumers to develop their own well-informed opinion about food safety issues. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Due to <b>the</b> {{rapid growth}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> organic food {{industry}} and <b>the</b> increasing popularity <b>of</b> organic fruits and vegetables, {{the health benefits}} and risks of organic produce are issues of significant importance. This review will compare organic and conventional produce in terms of nutritional value, pesticide contamination, and microbiological safety. The current literature shows that organic produce tends to contain higher levels of vitamin C {{and lower levels of}} nitrates, though more well controlled studies are necessary in order to reach any definitive conclusions. It has been definitively shown that organic produce contains fewer and lower levels of pesticides than conventional produce, though <b>the</b> long-term <b>health</b> consequences <b>of</b> ingestion <b>of</b> pesticides, and <b>the</b> clinical relevance <b>of</b> fewer and lower levels of pesticides in organic food, has yet to be determined. Organic farming methods can potentially lead to microbiological contamination, but the literature has shown that organic produce does not carry any higher risk of significant microbiological contamination than conventional produce. These findings in the current literature seem to suggest that organic produce can potentially be more beneficial, but certainly not more harmful, than conventional produce for <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>consumer...</b>|$|R
