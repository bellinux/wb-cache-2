40|$|THESIS 7454 A {{comprehensive}} study of <b>ethylcellulose</b> powder and <b>ethylcellulose</b> compacts (of different <b>ethylcellulose</b> viscosity grades) was undertaken. Studies showed that the lower viscosity grade <b>ethylcellulose</b> (4 cP) was more compressible than the higher <b>ethylcellulose</b> viscosity grades, resulting in compacts of higher tensile strength and lower compact porosity. These differences, in addition to differences such as surface roughness, water uptake and contact angle (with phosphate buffer) affected the release of ibuprofen from ethylcellulose:ibuprofen compacts prepared with different <b>ethylcellulose</b> viscosity grades. The effect of <b>ethylcellulose</b> viscosity grade and polymer-to-drug weight ratio on ibuprofen release from ethylcellulose:ibuprofen compacts was investigated. Results showed that the higher the <b>ethylcellulose</b> viscosity grade used during formulation the greater the percentage drug release. Experiments also found that {{as the level of}} drug concentration in the ethylcellulose; ibuprofen matrix formulation increased, the drug release rate also increased. It was thought that the increase in drug concentration resulted in an increase in compact porosity and a concomitant decrease in the tortuosity of the matrix.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to investigate the interaction of water with <b>ethylcellulose</b> samples and assess the effect of particle size on the interaction. The distribution of water within coarse particle <b>ethylcellulose</b> (CPEC; average particle size 310 μm) and fine particle <b>ethylcellulose</b> (FPEC; average particle size 9. 7 μm) of 7 cps viscosity grade was assessed by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and dynamic vapor sorption analysis.

The water permeabilities of cellulose acetate and <b>ethylcellulose</b> and the dissolution rate of hydroxypropyl methylcellulose phthalate were found to decrease with physical aging time after being quenched from above the glass transition temperatures to sub- T g temperatures.

Formulations consisting of metoprolol tartrate (MPT, concentration: 30 %), <b>ethylcellulose</b> (EC) plasticized by dibutylsebacate and polyethyleneoxide (PEO) were extruded and consequently injection moulded into tablets. The influence of process temperature (120 and 140 °C), matrix compostition, viscosity grade of <b>ethylcellulose</b> (4, 10, 20, 45 and 100 mPa. s) and polyethyleneoxide (7. 106, 1. 106 and 1. 105 10 Mw) on processability and drug release was determined. Formulations consisting of 70 % EC and 30 % MPT showed incomplete drug release, whereas drug release was too fast for formulations without EC. Higher PEO concentrations increased drug release. Formulations containing 30 % metoprolol, EC and different concentrations of PEO showed first-order release rates with limited burst release. Drug release from directed compressed tablets showed faster drug release rates compared to IM formulations. There was no clear relationship between the molecular weight of EC and drug release. The melting endotherm (113. 9 °C) of metoprolol tartrate observed in the DSC 18 thermogram of the tablets indicated that a solid dispersion was formed which was confirmed by X-RD.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the use of}} hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), sodium carboxymethylcellulose (NaCMC) or <b>ethylcellulose,</b> alone or {{in combination with other}} adjuncts, to control the release of propranolol hydrochloride from matrices. Gels were characterized by U tube viscometry and their cloud points of gels. The properties of polymers and their mixture in matrices or in gels were investigated by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). Compendial dissolution methodology was used to determine drug release from matrices and their release exponents. Propranolol hydrochloride increased the solubility of HPMC and altered the water distribution in their gels. The release of propranolol hydrochloride from HPMC matrices was dependent on the square root of time. Release exponents were - 0. 6, indicating that diffusion and erosion contributed to drug release. The release rates of propranolol hydrochloride from NaCMC matrices decreased as the NaCMC content increased. Addition of propranolol hydrochloride to NaCMC gels produced an insoluble complex which, in matrices, controlled the drug release. The interaction between propranolol hydrochloride and NaCMC was confirmed by DSC and dialysis. The viscosity grade of NaCMC affected the drug release. NaCMC matrices showed fast erosion. The release of sodium ions from matrices containing NaCMC was enhanced propranolol hydrochloride, confirming the occurrence of the interaction in matrices. The release of propranolol hydrochloride from NaCMC matrices was not dependent on either the square root of time or time. Large increases in release rates from matrices containing NaCMC in acidic media implied the polymer was unable to gel provide or a sustained release of propranolol hydrochloride at low pH. A synergistic increase in viscosity in gels containing HPMC and NaCMC probably played a minor role in propranolol release from matrices containing both polymers. NaCMC decreased the cloud point of HPMC. Drug release from matrices containing HPMC and NaCMC was very complicated, but zero order release was achieved from matrices containing 285 mg of 1 : 3 HPMC : NaCMC. Addition of HPMC to NaCMC matrices suppressed an initial burst release of propranolol. The release of propranolol hydrochloride from matrices containing HPMC and NaCMC was dependent on pH. <b>Ethylcellulose</b> was capable of binding = 14 % w/w water. Matrices containing <b>ethylcellulose</b> 7 cP (< 125 pm) showed lower release rates than matrices containing <b>ethylcellulose</b> 10 cP, or at greater particle sizes. Compaction pressure generally did not affect drug release. The release exponent from matrices containing <b>ethylcellulose</b> was 0. 44 - 0. 49 indicating diffusion predominated drug release.
