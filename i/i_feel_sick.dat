60|$|Mother, I {{am writing}} this in Major Hapgood's office, as usual. I am all alone to-day--Major is still absent, unwell, and the clerk is away somewhere. O how {{pleasant}} it is here--the weather I mean--and other things too, for that matter. I still occupy my little room, 394 L st.; get my own breakfast there; had good tea this morning, and some nice biscuit (yesterday morning and day before had peaches cut up). My friends the O'Connors that I wrote about recommenced cooking the 1st {{of this month}} (they have been, as usual in summer, taking their meals at a family hotel near by). Saturday they sent for me to breakfast, and Sunday I eat dinner with them--very good dinner, roast beef, lima beans, good potatoes, etc. They are truly friends to me. I still get my dinner at a restaurant usually. I {{have a very good}} plain dinner, which is the only meal of any account I make during the day; but it is just as well, for I would be in danger of getting fat on the least encouragement, and I have no ambition that way. Mother, it is lucky I like Washington in many respects, and that things are upon the whole pleasant personally, for {{every day of my life}} I see enough to make one's heart ache with sympathy and anguish here in the hospitals, and I do not know as I could stand it if it was not counterbalanced outside. It is curious, when I am present at the most appalling things--deaths, operations, sickening wounds (perhaps full of maggots)--I do not fail, although my sympathies are very much excited, but keep singularly cool; but often hours afterward, perhaps when I am home or out walking alone, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>sick</b> and actually tremble when I recall the thing and have it in my mind again before me. Mother, did you see my letter in the N. Y. Times of Sunday, Oct. 4? That was the long-delayed letter. Mother, I am very sorry Jeff did not send me the Union with my letter in--I wish very much he could do so yet; and always when I have a letter in a paper I would like to have one sent. If you take the Union, send me some once in a while. Mother, was it Will Brown sent me those? Tell him if so I was much obliged; and if he or Mr. and Mrs. Brown take any interest in hearing my scribblings, mother, you let them read the letters, of course. O, I must not close without telling you the highly important intelligence that I have cut my hair and beard--since the event Rosecrans, Charleston, etc., etc., have among my acquaintances been hardly mentioned, being insignificant themes in comparison. Jeff, my dearest brother, I have been going to write you a good gossipy letter for two or three weeks past; will try to yet, so it will reach you for Sunday reading--so good-bye, Jeff, and good-bye for present, mother dear, and all, and tell Andrew he must not be discouraged yet.|$|E

5000|$|Banksy's {{works have}} dealt with various {{political}} and social themes, including anti-war, anti-consumerism, anti-fascism, anti-imperialism, anti-authoritarianism, anarchism, nihilism, and existentialism. Additionally, {{the components of the}} human condition that the works commonly critique are greed, poverty, hypocrisy, boredom, despair, absurdity, and alienation. Although Banksy's works usually rely on visual imagery and iconography to put forth their message, Banksy has made several politically related comments in their various books. In summarising their list of [...] "people who should be shot", they listed [...] "Fascist thugs, religious fundamentalists, (and) people who write lists telling you who should be shot."

5000|$|<b>I</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>Sick</b> is a [...] "doubleshot", full-color {{comic book}} written and {{drawn by the}} comic artist Jhonen Vasquez and colored by Rosearik Rikki Simons (who also voiced GIR in Invader Zim). It {{revolves}} around Devi D. from Johnny the Homicidal Maniac (JTHM), and her dealings with the same supernatural and/or psychological forces that drove Johnny to lunacy. Originally intended as a single paperback, it was later split into two issues {{so as to avoid}} compromising the length of the story. It was published by Slave Labor Graphics. Vasquez stated that the creation process of <b>I</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>Sick</b> was cathartic. The problems Devi had while working for NERVE and neglecting her own work was reminiscent to the pressure Vasquez had while working on Invader Zim.|$|E

60|$|Mother, I {{think it}} worse than ever {{here in the}} hospitals. We are getting the dregs as it were of the {{sickness}} and awful hardships {{of the past three}} years. There is the most horrible cases of diarrhoea you ever conceived of and by the hundreds and thousands; I suppose from such diet as they have in the army. Well, dear mother, I will not write any more on the sick, and yet I know you wish to hear about them. Every one is so unfeeling; it has got to be an old story. There is no good nursing. O I wish you were--or rather women of such qualities as you and Mat--were here in plenty, to be stationed as matrons among the poor sick and wounded men. Just to be present would be enough--O what good it would do them. Mother, <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> so <b>sick</b> when <b>I</b> see what kind of people there are among them, with charge over them--so cold and ceremonious, afraid to touch them.

5000|$|In 1997, Vasquez gave Squee, a {{supporting}} character from Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, his own four-issue series. It chronicles Squee's encounters with aliens, Satan's son, and eventually Satan himself. The trade version (which features a cover image of Squee {{with the words}} [...] "Buy me or I'll die!") contains, {{in addition to the}} actual Squee comics, the Meanwhiles that were left out of the Director's Cut of Johnny the Homicidal Maniac, as well as comics of Vasquez's [...] "real life" [...] and Wobbly-Headed Bob. Vasquez's next project was <b>I</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>Sick,</b> colored by Rikki Simons. <b>I</b> <b>Feel</b> <b>Sick</b> follows a tortured artist named Devi (another character introduced in Johnny the Homicidal Maniac) as she tries to maintain her sanity in an insane vision of society, despite conversing with Sickness, one of her own paintings. Slave Labor has published three Fillerbunny mini-comics, the third having been released in March 2005.
