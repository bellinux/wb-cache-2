50|$|In medicine, <b>Fowler's</b> {{position}} {{is a standard}} patient position. It is an intervention used to promote oxygenation via maximum chest expansion and is implemented during events of respiratory distress. <b>Fowler's</b> position facilitates the relaxing of tension of the abdominal muscles, allowing for improved breathing. In immobile patients and infants, the <b>Fowler's</b> position alleviates compression of the chest that occurs due to gravity. <b>Fowler's</b> position increases comfort during eating and other activities, is used in postpartum women to improve uterine drainage, and in infants when signs of respiratory distress present. The patient is placed in a semi-upright sitting position (45-60 degrees) and may have knees either bent or straight. <b>Fowler's</b> {{position is}} also used when oral or nasal gastric feeding tubes have been implemented as it minimizes the risk of aspiration. Peristalsis and swallowing are aided by the effect of gravitational pull.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Sacral nerve {{stimulation}} (SNS) {{is an effective}} treatment for women with urinary retention. Some women present specific electromyography abnormalities of the external urethral sphincter (<b>Fowler's</b> syndrome). The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate whether <b>Fowler's</b> syndrome and psychologic preimplant screening could be predictive factors for long-term success of SNS in women with urinary retention. METHODS: All patients underwent electrophysiologic and urodynamic studies and voiding charts. A validated psychologic screening questionnaire was used. Women with successful temporary stimulation, received a definitive implant (Interstim Medtronic). They were followed prospectively every 6 months. Failure was defined as recurrent retention needing intermittent or permanent catheterisation. RESULTS: Sixty-two women were implanted, 30 with <b>Fowler's</b> syndrome, 32 with idiopathic retention. In those with <b>Fowler's</b> syndrome, 26. 6 % screened positive for somatisation, as did 43. 8 % in the idiopathic group (not significant [ns]). Screening for depression was positive in 30 % and 18. 8 %, respectively (ns). There was no correlation with outcome. Twenty-eight patients failed: 9 with <b>Fowler's</b> syndromes, 19 without (p= 0. 04). Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that patients with <b>Fowler's</b> syndrome benefitted significantly longer from SNS (log-rank test, p= 0. 005). CONCLUSIONS: The presence of <b>Fowler's</b> syndrome is a positive predictive factor for SNS in female urinary retention. Idiopathic urinary retention patients can benefit as well, but the success might be less predictable. Preimplant psychologic screening, using the Patient Health Questionnaire, does not correlate with long-term outcome of SNS in this population. status: publishe...|$|R
