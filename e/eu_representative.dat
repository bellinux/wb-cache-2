US Secretary of State Kerry had previously referred to a failure of the Middle East negotiations as [...] "unacceptable".After the previously unsuccessful negotiations in Geneva of the Syrian civil war parties, discussions at the security conference took no further approach towards the Syrian conflict. Despite his announcement of follow-up negotiations designated UN special envoy Lakhdar Brahimi stated the international peace efforts in Syria had failed. Brahimi warned of a further escalation of the situation in Syria. UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon called on the parties in conflict to lead future negotiations [...] "serious and sincere". The Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif echoed the call of his country for a ceasefire in Syria, referring to the difficulties of monitoring such actions.|$|E
50|$|Products within {{scope of}} the RoHS2 {{directive}} must display the CE mark, the manufacturers name and address and a serial or batch number. Parties needing to know more detailed compliance information can find this on the EU Declaration of Conformity for the product as created by the manufacturer (Brand owner) responsible for the design or the <b>EU</b> <b>representative.</b> The regulation also requires most actors in the supply chain for the product (importer and distributors) to keep and check this document, as well as ensuring a conformance process has been followed and the correct language translation for instructions are provided. The manufacturer must keep certain documentation to demonstrate conformity, known as a technical file or technical records. The directive requires the manufacturer to demonstrate conformity {{by the use of}} test data for all materials or by following a harmonised standard (EN50581:2012 is the only standard at the time of writing). Regulators may request this file or, more likely, specific data from it as it will likely be very large.|$|E

40|$|From the Introduction]. Thank {{you very}} much. I am {{delighted to have}} been able to accept the {{invitation}} to give this lecture. The EU and New Zealand have long enjoyed a close relationship. In 2002, the EU was New Zealand’s second largest export market. Over 400, 000 Europeans visit New Zealand each year and I gather they tend to stay longer – and spend more! – than any other visitor. And from my experience over the past few days, I can understand why. The sheer existence of this Centre is of course a further testament to our closeness. Geography might have placed us some distance apart, but culture, values and trade bring us ever closer together – as the appointment of an <b>EU</b> <b>representative</b> here signifies. I strongly support the Centre’s two objectives to research EU issues and to promote greater awareness of the EU’s role. I hope my lecture today will help to further them...|$|E
40|$|We {{discuss the}} role of the Netherlands in the crisis of Darfur during 2003 - 2005. The Netherlands was active as major donor and tried to {{facilitate}} political solutions since the breakout of the Darfur crisis. During the period July-December 2004 it acted as EU President and was as such involved in creating a common EU line. Additionally, it acted as <b>EU</b> <b>representative</b> in Khartoum for an extended period, while several Dutchmen were at high positions at the EU and UN. We discuss how policy was made and which domestic actors had influenced its foreign policy. Subsequently, we see how its foreign policy worked through international politics, especially within the EU. We conclude that the Netherlands was partially successful in establishing a more active EU position regarding Darfur. However, we also find evidence that eventually the EU has lagged behind the response of the UN Security Council, despite being a major donor to emergency relief and the African Union mission in Sudan...|$|E
