25|$|According to {{the social}} {{activity}} hypothesis, more frequent participation in social situations creates more frequent, and higher levels, of positive affect. Therefore, {{it is believed that}} since extraverts are characterized as more sociable than introverts, they also possess higher levels of positive affect brought on by social interactions. Specifically, the results of Furnham and Brewin's study (1990) suggest that extraverts enjoy and participate more in social activities than introverts, and as a result extraverts report higher level of happiness. Also, in the study of Argyle and Lu (1990) extraverts were found to be less likely to avoid participation in noisy social activities, and to be more likely to participate in social activities such as: party games, jokes, or <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cinema.</b> Similar results were reported by Diener, , and Emmons (1984) who found that extraverts seek social situations more often than introverts, especially when engaging in recreational activities.|$|E

Hermie finds himself succeeding with Aggie, who allows him to grope what he thinks is her breast; Oscy later points out Hermie was fondling her arm.|$|E

Leigh was a Year Eight student at Newcastle High School who enjoyed school, according to her grandmother.

2500|$|As a way {{of dealing}} with his {{loneliness}} and homesickness at this time, Konuma began <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cinema.</b> He majored in film studies in the Art Department of Nihon University. Soon after graduation, in 1961, Konuma went to work at Nikkatsu Studios, {{about the same time as}} producer Yuki and directors Kōyū Ohara and Noboru Tanaka. The quartet were known by their individual characters as, [...] "Diligent Yuki, slovenly Ohara, faithful Tanaka, reckless Konuma." [...] Konuma started as a [...] "fifth" [...] assistant director, which meant he was in charge of the clipboard. He endured this low position at the studio in the hope that eventually he would become a director. In his early career, he was the assistant director on such films as Nikkatsu's venture into the kaiju genre, Daikyojū Gappa (1967), which was released in the U.S. as Monster from a Prehistoric Planet. Seijun Suzuki was one of the few directors who impressed Konuma during these early years at Nikkatsu.|$|E
40|$|After the {{collapse}} of the once dominant studio system in the 1950 s, Hollywood executives were at a loss as to how <b>to</b> reassert <b>the</b> <b>cinema</b> atop <b>the</b> entertainment food chain. While ticket sales and box office takings were waning and the standard fare of epics and musicals failing <b>to</b> capture <b>the</b> imagination of the American public, the growing television industry was fast becoming Americas preferred source of entertainment. In their desperation <b>to</b> appeal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> youth market, the only market that seemed committed <b>to</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>cinemas,</b> <b>the</b> studios threw the doors open in the late 1960 s to a new generation of filmmakers, mainly born in the 1930 s, who had cut their teeth in television. This new group of filmmakers, influenced not only by their Hollywood predecessors but also by the experimental films being produced in Europe, revolutionised <b>the</b> American <b>cinema</b> with their gritty, often violent realism. They saw their films as legitimate forms of personal artistic expression, and a way of exploring issues surrounding American society. This quickly {{came to be known as}} the ‘New Hollywood’. Some scholars, however, prefer to see this late 1960 s activity as a precursor <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ‘New Hollywood’ which, they argue, commenced in the early 1970 s with the celebrated ‘movie brats’, the first generation of truly cineliterate directors who had studied at film schools. In the late 1970 s though the American film landscape would change again, with the unprecedented successes of Jaws (1975) and Star Wars (1977) ushering in a new era of blockbuster filmmaking. This led some scholars <b>to</b> redefine <b>the</b> meaning of the term ‘New Hollywood’ to align with this blockbuster movement, while others chose <b>to</b> use <b>the</b> term ‘New New Hollywood’. This paper explores the evolution of the term New Hollywood as film scholars, journalists and critics struggle to reach a consensus on what specifically was or is the ‘New Hollywood’. 10 page(s...|$|R
