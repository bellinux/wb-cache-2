500|$|On 13 December, she {{participated in}} another {{operation}} to escort a convoy to North Africa, but the attempt was broken off after a British radio deception effort convinced the Italians that the British fleet {{was in the}} area. While returning to port the following day, Vittorio Veneto was torpedoed by the British submarine [...] in the Straits of Messina. Urge fired a spread of three torpedoes, but only one hit on her port side. The torpedo tore a hole [...] long and caused over [...] of water to flood the ship, though the ship's Pugliese torpedo defense system successfully contained the explosion. Vittorio Veneto took on a 3.5degree list to port and was down by [...] by the stern. Some counter <b>flooding</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>compartment</b> on the starboard side abreast of the forward-most turret reduced the list by a degree, {{and she was able}} to steam under her own power back to port. She returned to Taranto for repairs, which lasted until early 1942.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of ongoing research efforts aimed at the theoretical development and practical implementation of a probabilistic framework for regulatory assessment of ship survivability following grounding accidents, with particular attention to passenger vessels. In the envisioned framework, the probabilities of <b>flooding</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>compartment,</b> or a group of compartments, i. e. the so-called "p-factors", are determined using a flexible and easily updatable direct non-zonal approach. The assessment of the conditional ship survivability, on the other hand, is based on the SOLAS "s-factor". The general framework is described, together with implementation details in the specific case of bottom grounding. Testing results, carried out using a specifically developed software tool, are also reported...|$|E
40|$|Embarcações pesqueiras representam uma parcela expressiva nas estatísticas de acidentes ocorridos no mar. Dentre estas, aquela que se destaca por impor uma perda sensível em vidas humanas é a ocorrência de emborcamentos. Quando tais embarcações passam a ser submetidas a um alagamento intermediário, sua situação de estabilidade pode ser diferente daquela prevista pela Arquitetura Naval Clássica que considera apenas efeitos estáticos. Assim, este trabalho propõe, a partir de duas simples modelagens, caracterizar o comportamento dinâmico do alagamento sob diferentes níveis e sua influência positiva ou negativa sobre a estabilidade da embarcação pesqueira realizando análises sobre o regime transiente e permanente do movimento. When a large {{compartment}} {{of a ship}} is flooded the water will affect the ship dynamic behaviour, and may {{have a significant impact}} on the vessels ability to withstand the action of waves. It is well known that complex dynamics can be associated with the loss of dynamic stability even for an intact ship, and these phenomena have been shown to be particularly relevant for fishing. We investigate here the effect of several levels of partial flooding on the dynamic processes that lead to loss of dynamic stability and capsize in waves. Two mathematical models are used in the present analysis. The first is a simplified model in which the vessel is acted upon by trains of regular beam waves. The free surface in this model is assumed to remain flat. The dynamic interaction between the vessel and the water inside it is modeled in such a way that the ensuing equations are those of a nonlinear inverted double pendulum. Drawing on this observation, an even simpler model was developed based on the idea of an equivalent mechanical pendulum. Since transient capsize in waves is a rapid phenomenon when compared to the <b>flooding</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>compartment,</b> the analyses consider the percentage of flooding as a varying parameter...|$|E
