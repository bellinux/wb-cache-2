However these methods are computational expensive and as such not currently an option for a real-time stereo requirement. By contrast local methods consider only a localised part of the image when approximating the disparity and minimise E(D) only implicitly (by minimising E(D) locally to obtain the best disparity Dbest).|$|R

50|$|Variance-based {{sensitivity}} analysis (often {{referred to as}} the Sobol method or Sobol indices, after Ilya M. Sobol) is a form of global {{sensitivity analysis}}. Working within a probabilistic framework, it decomposes the variance of the output of the model or system into fractions which can be attributed to inputs or sets of inputs. For example, given a model with two inputs and one output, one might find that 70% of the output variance is caused by the variance in the first input, 20% by the variance in the second, and 10% due to interactions between the two. These percentages are directly interpreted as measures of sensitivity. Variance-based measures of sensitivity are attractive because they measure sensitivity across the whole input space (i.e. it is a <b>global</b> <b>method),</b> they can deal with nonlinear responses, and they can measure the effect of interactions in non-additive systems.|$|E

Possible future work could explore hierarchical <b>global</b> <b>methods</b> for hardware implementations. The rectification unit can produce aliasing artifacts {{in case of}} extreme minification, e.g., if the pixel distances are reduced {{by more than a}} half. Low-pass pre-filtering of the input video could resolve the problem. However, most stereo cameras employ the same lenses and cameras, and therefore, this extreme case can safely be neglected.|$|R
40|$|The {{problem of}} motion estimation, in general, is made {{difficult}} by large illumination variations and by motion discontinuities. In recent papers, we {{and others have}} proposed global approaches to deal with both problems simultaneously within the regularization framework. A major drawback of such <b>global</b> <b>methods</b> is that several regularization parameters responsible for {{the integration of the}} illumination and motion components need to be determined in advance. This has reduced the applicability of <b>global</b> <b>methods.</b> In this paper, a parameter-free local approach, which solves a linear regression problem using a simple parametric model, is presented. To achieve robustness for the linear regression problem, we introduce {{a modified version of the}} least median of squares algorithm. We show quantitative error comparisons between the results obtained by our local approach and those produced by several <b>global</b> <b>methods.</b> Our results show that our local method is comparable to the best results obtained by the global approaches yet does not require any manual selection of parameters. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{existing}} {{methods of}} saliency detection can roughly be categorized into local and <b>global</b> <b>methods.</b> The local contrast-based methods compute the saliency {{of a specific}} image region based on it’s local neighborhoods [10 – 13]. The <b>global</b> contrast-based <b>methods</b> estimate the saliency of an image region by taking the contrast relations to the entire image into account [14 – 19]. In contrast to {{the weakness of the}} local methods which usually highlight the object boundary instead of the entire object, the <b>global</b> <b>methods</b> can generate saliency maps with full resolution and uniformly highlighted regions. However, only simple features are considered in calculating the motion saliency, such as flicker, which limits the models to the static background. If the salient object and background change simultaneously, the quality of the estimated saliency map is degraded rapidly.|$|R
40|$|Restoration {{of images}} is a {{significant}} area of research as presence of noise is unavoidable. Noises are modeled as Gaussian noise predominantly in all fields of image processing on images acquired from all spectrums. The <b>global</b> <b>method</b> of Adaptive Wiener Filter seems to perform the best amongst all the filters available. Numerous studies have established this fact. We have tried to develop a local bitplane Adaptive Wiener Filter Algorithm which performs {{much better than the}} traditional filter. The results are not only visually verifiable but the Root Mean Square Error and the Peak Signal to Noise Ratio parameters validate our results. The suggested algorithm is actually a modification of the original one hence the processing time is not significantly effected. The algorithm works because instead of the <b>global</b> <b>method</b> which blurs out the edges, the local bitplane method works on the windows in the bitplane and hence the edges are preserved in a much better way. The results are more dominant in cases with larger variance noise and larger window size which tends to get blurred more in the <b>global</b> <b>method...</b>|$|E

40|$|IR-sensors {{are mainly}} {{utilized}} in video surveillance systems {{in order to}} provide vision during nighttime and in di use lighting conditions. The dynamic range of IR-sensors usually exceeds that of conventional display devices. Hence, range compression associated with loss of information is always required. Range compression methods can be divided into <b>global</b> <b>methods,</b> which are based on the intensity distribution, and local methods focused on smaller regions of interest. In contrast to local <b>methods,</b> <b>global</b> <b>methods</b> are computationally efficient. Nevertheless, <b>global</b> <b>methods</b> have the drawback that fine details can be suppressed by intensity changes at image locations which are unrelated to the object of interest. In order to overcome these restrictions, we propose a method to render IR images based on high level object information. The overall processing pipeline consists of a contrast enhancement method, followed by object detection, and a range compression method that takes the location of objects into account. Here we use pedestrians as an exemplary object category. The output of the detector is a rectangular bounding box, centered at the person location. Restricting range compression to a person location, allows to display details on the person surface that most probably would remain undetected using <b>global</b> range compression <b>methods.</b> The proposed combination of rendering with high level information is intended to be integrated in a surveillance system to assist human operators.

40|$|Abstract:- Stereoscopic {{analysis}} {{is widely used}} in machine vision applications. Local and <b>global</b> <b>methods</b> are two main branches of stereoscopic analysis. The <b>global</b> <b>methods</b> typically minimize a cost function over the entire scene. Although these methods provide high estimation accuracy, because of its high complexity, they are not suitable for real-time implementation. The local methods typically use window-correlation approaches, and the associated complexity is generally low. However, the estimation accuracy is sensitive to the selected window size. In this paper, we propose a multistage local method that operates on image segments instead of traditional rectangular windows. This new approach exploits the unique characteristics of image segments, and reduces occlusion through a feedback system. Experimental results show {{that it is very}} effective for natural images. In addition, it has a low computational complexity which may be suitable for real-time implementation...|$|R

Results from the frequency distribution method are compared with those from standard techniques among local, partially local and global methods. Our approach offers the main advantage to be independent from the selection of any threshold, neighborhood, or other parameter that affect most of the currently available methods for hotspot analysis. The two case studies show how such elements of arbitrariness of the traditional methods influence both size and location of the identified hotspots, and how this new <b>global</b> <b>method</b> can be used for a more objective selection of hotspots...|$|E

40|$|Abstract The major {{challenge}} in constructing a statistical shape {{model for a}} structure is shape correspondence, which identifies a set of corresponded landmarks across a population of shape instances to accurately estimate the underlying shape variation. Both global or pairwise shapecorrespondence methods {{have been developed to}} automatically identify the corresponded landmarks. For <b>global</b> <b>methods,</b> landmarks are found by optimizing a comprehensive objective function that considers the entire population of shape instances. While <b>global</b> <b>methods</b> can produce very accurate shape correspondence, they tend to be very inefficient when the population size is large. For pairwise methods, all shape instances are corresponded to a given template independently. Therefore, pairwise methods are usually very efficient. However, if the population exhibits a large amount of shape variation, pairwise methods may produce very poor shape correspondence. In this paper, we develop a new method that attempts to address the limitations of <b>global</b> and pairwise <b>methods.</b> In particular, we first construct a shape tree to globally organize the population of shape instances by identifying similar shape instance pairs.
