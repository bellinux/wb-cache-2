It had been booked in, that they were coming in to record their next single, and write <b>it,</b> <b>with</b> <b>us.</b> It was at Whitfield Street Studios and there was going to be an MTV crew there filming them as they did this, which there was. Well, how on earth can you possibly do this? You can't write and record a song in half-an-hour with a film crew watching.|$|E

25|$|On {{the morning}} of Thursday, October 10, 1985 Oliver North had {{contacted}} Israeli Major General Uri Simhoni, the military attaché at the Israeli embassy in Washington. (Simhoni had been helpful in giving information that helped locate the Achille Lauro during the hijacking.) He relayed to North that the four hijackers were at the Al Maza airfield near Cairo. Later that morning American sources confirmed the information and added that the Egyptians were planning to transport the men {{out of the country}} at night, presumably to Tunis, aboard a commercial EgyptAir jet. James R. Stark realized that due to ongoing disputes that Egypt had with Libya and Chad that the plane would most likely fly over the Mediterranean sea which raised the option of intercepting <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>U.S.</b> Navy fighters. Stark recalled that during World War II, American fighters had acted on intelligence to intercept Japanese Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto and advocated a similar action (with a forced landing rather than shooting the aircraft down). Due to anticipated political problems the idea of forcing the plane to land in either Israel or Cyprus was dismissed. The NATO base at Sigonella, Italy was chosen.|$|E

[...] The song's lyrics is about [...] "taunting a hapless man with the lyrics, [...] "Don't cha wish your girlfriend was hot like me / Don't cha wish your girlfriend was a freak like me". The chorus of the song is based on Sir Mix A Lot's song [...] "Swass" [...] (1988). Maeve McDermott distinguished [...] "Don't Cha" [...] from other girl group songs like [...] "Wannabe", [...] "Independent Women" [...] and [...] "No Scrubs" [...] which promote female camaraderie. Marisa Meltzer of The Daily Beast felt that the song's lyrics [...] "put forward the belief that a woman's worth lies solely in her appearance and sexual permissiveness and just furthers the notion that women are in competition with one another over men." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1941, {{while still}} neutral, the United States began {{providing}} Lend Lease munitions to Britain and China. Some {{went to the}} Free French in North Africa, starting in 1942. Among the large inventories of American equipment passed to Free French Forces were several versions of the M4 Sherman medium tank. [...] French armored divisions were organized and equipped the same as U.S. Army armored divisions and were sizable offensive commands. In 1943, the French decided to raise a new army in North Africa, and had {{an agreement with the}} Americans to equip <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>US</b> modern weapons. The French 2nd Armored Division (...) entered the Battle of Normandy fully equipped with M4A2s. The 1st and 5th DB, which entered S. France as part of the First French Army were equipped with a mixture of M4A2 and M4A4 medium tanks. The 3rd DB, which served as a training and reserve organization for the three operational armored divisions was equipped with roughly 200 medium and light tanks. Of these, 120 were later turned in to the U.S. Army's Delta Base Section for reissue. Subsequent combat losses for the 1st, 2nd, and 5th Armored Divisions were replaced with standard-issue tanks from U.S. Army stocks.|$|E
