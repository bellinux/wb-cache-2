Current <b>European</b> <b>legislation</b> demands that [...] "acute toxicity tests {{must be carried out}} in two or more mammalian species" [...] covering [...] "at least two different routes of administration". Sub-acute toxicity is where the drug is given to the animals for four to six weeks in doses below the level at which it causes rapid poisoning, in order to discover if any toxic drug metabolites build up over time. Testing for chronic toxicity can last up to two years and, in the European Union, is required to involve two species of mammals, one of which must be non-rodent.|$|E

Some of the larger islands have development trusts that support the local economy and, in striking contrast to the 19th and 20th century domination by absentee landlords, more than {{two thirds of the}} Western Isles population now lives on community-owned estates. However the economic position of the islands remains relatively precarious. The Western Isles, including Stornoway, are defined by Highlands and Islands Enterprise as an economically [...] "Fragile Area" [...] and they have an estimated trade deficit of some £163.4 million. Overall, the area is relatively reliant on primary industries and the public sector, and fishing and fish farming in particular are vulnerable to environmental impacts, changing market pressures, and <b>European</b> <b>legislation.</b>|$|E
500|$|The revised {{directive}} {{went into}} force in June 1998, and banned sponsorship from 2003, with a further three-year extension for [...] "global {{sports such as}} Formula One". On 5 October 2000, the directive was successfully overturned in the European Court of Justice {{on the grounds that}} it was unlawful. A new Tobacco Advertising Directive took effect in July 2005; the Financial Times described Mosley as [...] "furious" [...] that this was a year earlier than provided for under the 1998 directive. As of 2009, Ferrari is the only F1 team to retain tobacco sponsorship, although the team carries no explicit branding in races because of the <b>European</b> <b>legislation.</b> Although the FIA moved its headquarters out of the EU in 1999, it returned in 2001; all of the F1 teams remain in Europe, and six are in the UK, compared to seven of eleven at the end of 1997.|$|E

500|$|Three {{types of}} {{judicial}} interpretation are commonly {{identified in the}} context of section 3: [...] "reading in", [...] "reading out" [...] and [...] "reading down". [...] "Reading in" [...] refers to adding in words that are not present in the statute so as to ensure compliance with Convention rights, and [...] "reading out" [...] removing words in a statute to do so. These processes had already been implemented with reference to the implementation of <b>European</b> <b>legislation,</b> so as to ensure compliance of domestic law with European law. Although accepted with secondary legislation, they remain controversial with primary legislation, since parliament would have included or omitted such words if it had had such an intent; reading in or out words would therefore conflict with parliamentary intention. Courts have, however, accepted these powers, and during the passing of the Human Rights Act, it was agreed that the courts would have such a power.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the same}} period, Mosley was {{attempting}} to delay <b>European</b> <b>legislation</b> banning tobacco advertising. At this time all leading Formula One teams carried significant branding from tobacco brands such as Rothmans, West, Marlboro and Mild Seven. The Labour party had pledged to ban tobacco advertising in its manifesto ahead of its 1997 General Election victory, supporting a proposed European Union Directive. [...] The Labour Party's stance on banning tobacco advertising was reinforced following the election by forceful statements from the Health Secretary Frank Dobson and Minister for Public Health Tessa Jowell. Ecclestone appealed [...] "over Jowell's head" [...] to Jonathan Powell, Tony Blair's chief of staff, who arranged a meeting with Blair. Ecclestone and Mosley, both Labour Party donors, met Blair on 16 October 1997. Mosley argued that the proposed legislation was illegal by EU rules, that Formula One needed more time to find alternative sources of funding and that the prompt introduction of a ban would lead to races being held outside Europe, while the coverage, including tobacco logos, would still be broadcast into the EU. He also argued that: ...|$|E
