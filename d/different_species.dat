These {{may be of}} the same species, as in sexual selection, or of <b>different</b> <b>species,</b> as in cleaning symbiosis. Signals, which often combine colour and movement, may be understood by many different species; for example, the cleaning stations of the banded coral shrimp Stenopus hispidus are visited by <b>different</b> <b>species</b> of fish, and even by reptiles such as hawksbill sea turtles.|$|E

5|$|Miniopterus manavi (Manavi long-fingered bat) is a bat in {{the genus}} Miniopterus {{that occurs in}} east-central Madagascar. First {{described}} in 1906, this species was later included in the mainland African M.minor. A 1995 revision united populations of small Miniopterus from Madagascar and the Comoros as M.manavi, but molecular and morphological studies in 2008 and 2009 showed that this concept of M.manavi in fact included five <b>different</b> <b>species.</b> M.manavi itself was restricted to a few locations in the eastern Central Highlands and populations in the Comoros and northern and western Madagascar were allocated to <b>different</b> <b>species.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{relative}} abundance of <b>different</b> <b>species</b> of plants in ecological communities including forests and grasslands may be determined {{in part by}} the level of defensive compounds in the <b>different</b> <b>species.</b> Since the cost of replacement of damaged leaves is higher in conditions where resources are scarce, it may also be that plants growing in areas where water and nutrients are scarce may invest more resources into anti-herbivore defenses.|$|E
5|$|Though {{often used}} interchangeably, in biology these words have {{different}} meanings. Fish {{is used as}} a singular noun, or as a plural to describe multiple individuals from a single species. Fishes is used to describe <b>different</b> <b>species</b> or species groups. Thus a pond that contained a single species might be said to contain 120 fish. But if the pond contained a total of 120 fish from three <b>different</b> <b>species,</b> it would be said to contain three fishes. The distinction is similar to that between people and peoples.|$|E

One- and {{two-dimensional gel electrophoresis}} showed similarities in protein profiles among the <b>different</b> Brucella <b>species</b> that correlated with lymphocyte reactivity.
