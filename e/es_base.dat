40|$|Previous {{research}} has focused on improving the throughput of Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) schemes.

This paper explores the complexity of turbo HARQ schemes and proposes a new Early Stopping (ES) approach for iterative decoding based on Mutual Information (MI), which dynamically determines the appropriate number of BCJR operations to be performed following each Incremental-Redundancy (IR) transmission. We demonstrate that the proposed <b>ES</b> <b>based</b> Multiple-Component Turbo Code (MCTC) aided and systematic Twin-Component Turbo Code (TCTC) assisted HARQ schemes exhibit a 60 % to 85 % reduced complexity for SNRs below - 2 dB, without degrading the Packet Loss Ratio (PLR) and the throughput...|$|R

A comparison of these findings with objectives concerning ecological sustainability demonstrates that present-day household energy use is not sustainable.

Scenario evaluation shows a substantial reduction of direct energy use; however, this is not enough to meet the sustainability objectiv <b>es.</b> <b>Based</b> on these results, the possibilities and the limitations are discussed to enable households to make their direct and indirect energy use sustainable on the long run...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Safe and optimal {{operation}} of complex production processes {{is one of}} the most important research and development problems in process engineering. This problem is the most relevant at the design of the optimal feeding profile of fed-batch chemical reactors due to the nonlinear and unstable dynamical behavior of the processes. This paper shows that how the optimal feeding policy can be determined in fed-batch reactors by sequential quadratic programming, classical evolutionary strategy (ES) and the advanced version of <b>ES</b> that is <b>based</b> on covariance matrix adaptation. A multi-objective function was created and the search space was constrained in case of all of the three applied algorithms. The switching times between states in the feeding trajectory and the feed rates in each state were manipulated to find the global minima of the objective function. To obtain the optimal feeding policy the first-principle model of a pilot fed-batch reactor was implemented in MATLAB and applied as a dynamic simulator of the process. Off-line optimization process was carried out in case of different dosing time distribution. As the results show a significant improvement can be achieved in process performance applying advanced <b>ES</b> <b>based</b> optimization algorithms to generate feeding trajectories...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Enterprise Services (ES) are Web {{services}} with which enterprise applications expose {{a subset of}} their functionality. Due to the often high number of different ES, {{as well as the}} complex nature of their names, it is difficult for non-technical business users to discover services in ES repositories. However, most of this complexity stems from a SOA governance-driven service design process that is essential to the development of harmonized and long-lasting <b>ES.</b> <b>Based</b> on the example of SAP’s ES, we describe a representational model that consolidates existing models and patterns used during the service design process. We created an iterative search approach that uses this consolidated metadata. The evaluation of the approach with real business users, based on a prototypical implementation, demonstrates that our iterative search is more efficient and effective than the currently offered search. ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Despite the {{importance}} of exogenous electron shuttles (ESs) in extracellular electron transfer (EET), {{a lack of understanding}} of the key properties of ESs is a concern given their different influences on EET processes. Here, the ES-mediated EET capacity of Shewanella putrefaciens 200 (SP 200) was evaluated by examining the electricity generated in a microbial fuel cell. The results indicated that all the ESs substantially accelerated the current generation compared to only SP 200. The current and polarization parameters were linearly correlated with both the standard redox potential (EES 0) and the electron accepting capacity (EAC) of the ESs. A thermodynamic analysis of the electron transfer from the electron donor to the electrode suggested that the EET from c-type cytochromes (c-Cyts) to ESs is a crucial step causing the differences in EET capacities among various <b>ESs.</b> <b>Based</b> on the derived equations, both EE...|$|R

With {{the advent of}} <b>ES</b> <b>based</b> on a serviceoriented architecture (SOA) and an increasing demand of IT-supported interorganizational collaboration, implementation projects face paradigmatically new challenges. The configuration of ES is costly and error-prone. Dependencies between business processes and business documents are hardly explicit and foster component proliferation instead of reuse. Configurative modeling can support the problem in two ways: First, conceptual modeling abstracts from technical details and provides more intuitive access and overview. Second, configuration allows the projection of variants from master models providing manageable variants with controlled flexibility. We aim at tackling the problem by proposing an integrated model-based framework for configuring both, processes and business documents, on an equal basis; as together, they constitute the core business components of an ES...|$|R
