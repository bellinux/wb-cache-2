40|$|Abstract. It is {{an undeniable}} {{fact that people}} want information. Unfortunately, even in today’s highly {{automated}} society, {{a lot of the}} information we desire is still manually collected. An example is fuel prices where websites providing <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> <b>information</b> either send their workers out to manually collect the prices or depend on volunteers manually relaying the information. This paper proposes a novel application of wireless sensor networks to automatically collect fuel prices from camera images of road-side price board (billboard) of service (or gas) stations. Our system exploits the ubiquity of mobile phones that have cameras as well as users contributing and sharing data. In our proposed system, cameras of contributing users will be automatically triggered when they get close to a service station. These images will then be processed by computer vision algorithms to extract the fuel prices. In this paper, we will describe the system architecture and present results from our computer vision algorithms. Based on 52 images, our system achieves a hit rate of 92. 3 % for correctly detecting the fuel price board from the image background and reads the prices correctly in 87. 7 % of them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of a sensor network being used for collecting consumer pricing information.

40|$|City {{streets are}} full of useful {{information}} pertaining to the environment, traffic, commerce and crime, which can benefit the public. Unfortunately, even in today's highly advanced society, most street level information that we desire is still collected manually. Recent advances in mobile phone technology makes it feasible for ordinary users to sense and contribute their ambient information with their smartphones. A new paradigm of PS has emerged, driven by the ubiquitous presence of smartphones. An important form of PS is image sensing, as ``a picture is worth a thousand words''. In this thesis we design and implement a PS system called PetrolWatch that allows volunteers to automatically collect, contribute and share <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> <b>information.</b> The fuel price is automatically collected from road-side price board images captured by a vehicle mounted smartphone. By leveraging a variety of embedded phone sensors such as GPS receiver and publicly available information {{in the form of}} GIS database, our system automatically captures a sequence of fuel price board images when it approaches a service station. These images are then transported to a central server where computer vision algorithms are implemented for board detection and fuel price extraction. Initial road tests show challenges in image capturing and processing. To overcome these challenges, we develop an automatic image capturing system, including a camera control scheme and an image pre-selection algorithm, to capture high quality images from a moving vehicle. We further design sophisticated computer vision algorithms to extract price data from the collected images. Our global colour classification algorithm, based on machine learning techniques, significantly improves the board detection and fuel price extraction rates. We develop a PetrolWatch prototype on a Nokia N 95 mobile phone. Extensive driving experiments were conducted in suburban Sydney to validate and optimize our work. Experimental results show that our design achieves a board detection rate of 86 %, a price character classification rate of 85 %, and a low false positive board detection rate of 10 %. The final price extraction rate is 73. 1 % which combines the board detection rate and price character classification rate...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{a number of}} issues regarding petroleum product pricing in Western Africaemphasizing international spillovers. We use panel unit root rests and long-run modeling based on vector error correction models to assess links and convergence in petroleum product prices across countries. Our results indicate that in general over the long-run there is convergence in prices across the countries. The estimation results for gasoline and diesel prices suggest the presence of long-run links between retail prices among the different country groupings with long-run multipliers ranging from 11 to - 6. 66. The speed of Adjustment to equilibrium varies significantly according to the countrygroupings considered. In contrast, the econometric results for kerosene prices not only indicate a weaker link between prices across countries, but also a much slower adjustment to equilibrium. Inlight of these important spillovers, the need to better coordinate pricing s and tax policies towards petroleum products at the regional level becomes apparent.

To assist in aviation systems planning under such <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> uncertainty and environmental regulation, this study takes a total logistic cost approach and evaluates three representative aircraft (narrow body, regional jet, and turboprop) for operating and passenger preference costs over a range of <b>fuel</b> <b>prices.</b> Homogenous fleets of each vehicle category are compared for operating and passenger costs over a range of <b>fuel</b> <b>prices</b> and route distances and the minimum cost fleet mix is determined.

The inclusion of passenger costs along with operating costs decreases the <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> - distance space where the turboprop exhibits the lower cost.

ENGLISH ABSTRACT: This {{study was}} an attempt to analyse the {{relationship}} between Brent crude oil prices, the South African rand US$ exchange rate and <b>fuel</b> <b>prices</b> in South Africa. Covering the period between 2003 and 2013, the ultimate objective was to test if there is asymmetric prices adjustment between Brent crude oil prices and the rand US$ exchange rate, on the one hand, and retail <b>fuel</b> <b>prices</b> on the other hand. As a time-series analysis, the study used the Augmented Dickey Fuller and Phillips-Perron tests for stationarity, as well as some cointegration tests. The results show that the effect of the current crude oil price and the exchange rate between the ZAR and the US$ on current <b>fuel</b> <b>prices</b> is insignificant. Instead, the current <b>fuel</b> <b>prices</b> are affected mainly by the previous month’s <b>fuel</b> <b>price,</b> the crude oil price and the exchange rate. Furthermore, the results of the threshold autoregressive model (TAR) do not prove the presence of asymmetry in the <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> adjustment on a month-to-month basis in South Africa. The conclusion here is that the basic <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> model is aligned to its import parity objective of symmetric adjustment in <b>fuel</b> <b>prices.</b> However, there exist some structural inefficiencies in South Africa`s fuel market, therefore policymakers should address those short-term inefficiencies in the price transmission from crude oil to <b>fuel</b> <b>prices...</b>|$|R

The <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> scenarios are based on forecasts by the US Department of Energy (DOE-US) and the International Energy Agency (IEA-OECD) and represent {{a wide range of}} projections for absolute and relative fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>prices.</b> In terms of the long term economic impact, our results suggest a 1. 9 percent drop in GDP in the DOE-US scenario and 1. 6 percent in the IEA-OECD scenario. As to the budgetary impact, higher <b>fuel</b> <b>prices</b> lead to lower tax revenues, which, coupled with a reduction in public spending, translate into lower public deficits. Accordingly, increasing <b>fuel</b> <b>prices</b> create an important policy trade off in that they can contribute to reducing the public deficit while hindering economic growth. We find that fairly strong incentives for wind energy can reduce the economic impact of <b>fuel</b> <b>prices</b> by 14. 2 percent in the DOE-US price scenario and 18. 5 percent reduction in the IEA-OECD price scenario. Finally, our results highlight the importance of public sector spending decisions and the mechanisms of endogenous growth in understanding the impact of fossil <b>fuel</b> <b>prices.</b> Indeed, a scenario of higher <b>fuel</b> <b>prices</b> would, with exogenous public decisions and exogenous economic growth assumptions, result in substantially smaller economic effects and yield adverse budgetary effects. <b>Fuel</b> <b>Prices,</b> Economic Performance, Budgetary Consolidation, Dynamic General Equilibrium,Endogenous Growth, Portugal. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> {{changes can be}} seen in {{practically}} all sectors of the United States economy. <b>Fuel</b> <b>prices</b> directly and indirectly influence the daily life of most Americans. The national economy as well as the high standard of living we have come to enjoy in the United States is run on gasoline. Since the late 19902 ̆ 7 s the days of cheap oil and 1. 00 gallons of gas are clearly over, understanding the influences of <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> is more important now than ever. Since 1998 regular gasoline prices have increased 0. 22 per gallon per year on average through the present with little evidence suggesting this trend will slow down or reverse substantially. The drastic and permanent change to the status quo of <b>fuel</b> <b>prices</b> has potentially rendered traditional knowledge of <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> elasticities inapplicable to current analysis. Obtaining accurate measures of <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> elasticities is important as it is used as a measure of personal mobility and can be related to the quality of life the public is experiencing. Price elasticities are also used in determining the future revenue available for surface transportation projects. Traditionally, short-run <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> elasticities are thought to be inelastic allowing transportation agencies to ignore short-run <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> changes to some degree when creating future projects and evaluating its economic feasibility. By using driving data collected from The National Evaluation of a Mileage-based Road User Study the <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> elasticity of vehicle-miles traveled (VMT), as well as the sensitivity of gas prices relative to a historical high price, were estimated for the first year study participants using a panel data set approach with linear regression.

[...] In addition to developing these low, medium and high <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> projections, estimates of the social cost of carbon (previously included as estimates of potential carbon taxes), a premium for low sulfur <b>fuels,</b> and a <b>price</b> differential for home heating fuel are provided and are incorporated into the Renewable Energy Fund benefit-cost model for evaluating potential projects. The settings of these parameters are public policy considerations selected for project reviews by the AEA. The <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> projections are limited in their applicability to the modeling of project benefits and costs and should not be considered <b>fuel</b> <b>price</b> forecasts...|$|R
