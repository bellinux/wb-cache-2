40|$|Abstract: The {{wide range}} of {{properties}} covered by the manufacturable fiber–matrix combinations of <b>composite</b> <b>materials,</b> along with their directional property characteristics, provides designers with material selection flexibility during designing <b>composite</b> <b>material</b> products. Meeting multiple property goals, however, complicates the design process as both the <b>composite</b> <b>material</b> selection and the component shape formation becomes intricate with the multiple loading conditions, which may require matrix calculations of high order to determine theoretical value of <b>composite</b> <b>material</b> properties. This article presents a grammatical approach that is derived by extending shape grammars to simultaneously consider {{the shape of a}} component and select appropriate <b>composite</b> <b>materials</b> to meet multiple property goals, derived from a set of design loads. In this approach the grammar is divided into four interconnected steps, which are used to design the shape of the component depending on its function and user requirements, calculate the property requirements from the loading constraints based on the designed shape, and select <b>composite</b> <b>materials</b> according to the property requirements.
