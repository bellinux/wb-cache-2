500|$|In late 1968, {{they began}} to record their first album and signed with Atlantic Records that afforded them {{considerable}} artistic freedom. Their first album, Led Zeppelin was released in early 1969. The album contained four cover versions and singer Robert Plant originally received no writing credits due to unexpired contractual obligations resulting from his association with CBS Records. Plant received writing credits on later editions of the album. Their second album, Led Zeppelin II, was released later that year in October. Against the band's wishes, the opening track, [...] "Whole Lotta Love", was released as a single in the US. However, the single was a commercial success, selling over one million copies and helped cement the group's popularity. Their third album, Led Zeppelin III, was released a year later in October 1970. The opening track, [...] "Immigrant Song", backed by the band's only non-album single, [...] "Hey, <b>Hey,</b> <b>What</b> Can I Do", was released as a single in the US. Their fourth album was released on in November 1971 and was untitled {{partly due to the}} rather indifferent response drawn from Led Zeppelin III; the album is commonly referred to as Led Zeppelin IV. A huge critical and commercial success, the album contains some of the band's best-known songs, including [...] "Black Dog", [...] "Rock and Roll", [...] "Going to California" [...] and [...] "Stairway to Heaven", referred to {{as one of the greatest}} rock songs of all time, and helping secure the group's popularity.|$|E

2500|$|The {{mandolin}} {{has been}} used extensively in the traditional music of England and Scotland for generations. Simon Mayor is a prominent British player who has produced six solo albums, instructional books and DVDs, as well as recordings with his mandolin quartet the Mandolinquents. The instrument has also {{found its way into}} British rock music. The mandolin was played by Mike Oldfield (and introduced by Vivian Stanshall) on Oldfield's album Tubular Bells, as well as on a number of his subsequent albums (particularly prominently on Hergest Ridge (1974) and Ommadawn (1975)). It was used extensively by the British folk-rock band Lindisfarne, who featured two members on the instrument, Ray Jackson and Simon Cowe, and whose [...] "Fog on the Tyne" [...] was the biggest selling UK album of 1971–72. The instrument was also used extensively in the UK folk revival of the 1960s and 1970s with bands such as Fairport Convention and Steeleye Span taking it on as the lead instrument in many of their songs. Maggie May by Rod Stewart, which hit No. 1 on both the British charts and the Billboard Hot 100, also featured Jackson's playing. It has also been used by other British rock musicians. Led Zeppelin's bassist John Paul Jones is an accomplished mandolin player and has recorded numerous songs on mandolin including Going to California and That's the Way; the mandolin part on The Battle of Evermore is played by Jimmy Page, who composed the song. Other Led Zeppelin songs featuring mandolin are Hey <b>Hey</b> <b>What</b> Can I Do, and Black Country Woman. Pete Townshend of the Who played mandolin on the track Mike Post Theme, along with many other tracks on Endless Wire. McGuinness Flint, for whom Graham Lyle played the mandolin on their most successful single, When I'm Dead And Gone, is another example. Lyle was also briefly a member of Ronnie Lane's Slim Chance, and played mandolin on their hit How Come. One of the more prominent early mandolin players in popular music was Robin Williamson in the Incredible String Band. Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull is a highly accomplished mandolin player (beautiful track Pussy Willow), as is his guitarist Martin Barre. The popular song Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want by the Smiths featured a mandolin solo played by Johnny Marr. More recently, the Glasgow-based band Sons and Daughters featured the mandolin, played by Ailidh Lennon, on tracks such as Fight, Start to End, and Medicine. British folk-punk icons the Levellers also regularly use the mandolin in their songs. Current bands are also beginning to use the Mandolin and its unique sound - such as South London's Indigo Moss who use it throughout their recordings and live gigs. The mandolin has also featured in the playing of Matthew Bellamy in the rock band Muse. It also forms the basis of Paul McCartney's 2007 hit [...] "Dance Tonight." [...] That {{was not the first time}} a Beatle played a mandolin, however; that distinction goes to George Harrison on Gone Troppo, the title cut from the 1982 album of the same name. The mandolin is taught in Lanarkshire by the Lanarkshire Guitar and Mandolin Association to over 100 people. Also more recently hard rock supergroup Them Crooked Vultures have been playing a song based primarily using a mandolin. This song was left off their debut album, and features former Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones.|$|E
