25|$|I {{have the}} honour to <b>inform</b> <b>you</b> that the Government of the Irish Republic, having {{as its first}} duty towards its people the {{establishment}} and maintenance of peace and order here, demand the withdrawal of all British armed forces stationed in Ireland. The occupation of our territory by troops of another nation and the persistent subvention here of activities directly against the expressed national will and {{in the interests of}} a foreign power, prevent the expansion and development of our institution in consonance with our social needs and purposes, and must cease.|$|E
25|$|I {{am happy}} {{to be able to}} <b>inform</b> <b>you</b> that we have now in the United States a negro, the son of a black man born in Africa, and of a black woman born in the United States, who is a very respectable mathematician. I {{procured}} him to be employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new federal city on the Patowmac, & in the intervals of his leisure, while on that work, he made an Almanac for the next year, which he sent me in his own hand writing, & which I inclose to you. I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. Add to this that he is a very worthy & respectable member of society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them is merely the effect of their degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference {{in the structure of the}} parts on which intellect depends.|$|E

500|$|After {{a history}} of epileptic attacks, Patsy Custis died {{suddenly}} in Washington's arms in 1773. [...] The day following Patsy's death, Washington wrote to Burwell Bassett: [...] "It is an easier to conceive, than to describe, the distress of this Family, especially that of the unhappy Parent of our Dear Patcy Custis, when I <b>inform</b> <b>you</b> that yesterday re- moved the Sweet, Innocent Girl into a more happy & peaceful abode than any she has met with, the aflicted path she hitherto has trod." [...] Washington cancelled all business activity and, {{for the next three}} months, was not away from Martha for a single night. Patsy's death enabled Washington to pay off his British creditors, since half of her inheritance passed to him.|$|E

500|$|A {{detail of}} papal carabinieri (military police) led by Marshal Pietro Lucidi and Brigadier Giuseppe Agostini {{arrived at the}} Mortara {{apartment}} in Bologna soon after sunset on 23 June 1858. After asking a few questions about the family, Lucidi announced: [...] "Signor Mortara, I am sorry to <b>inform</b> <b>you</b> {{that you are the}} victim of a betrayal", and explained that they were under orders from Father Feletti to take Edgardo as he had been baptised. Marianna screamed hysterically, ran to Edgardo's bed and shrieked {{that they would have to}} kill her before taking him. Lucidi said repeatedly that he was only following Feletti's orders. He reported afterwards that he [...] "would have a thousand times preferred to be exposed to much more serious dangers in performing my duties than to have to witness such a painful scene." ...|$|E
500|$|Dickinson {{wrote in}} a letter to Colonel John Nielson on January23, [...] "I have the {{pleasure}} to <b>inform</b> <b>you</b> that on Monday last with about 450 men chiefly our militia I attacked a foraging party near V.

[...] General Washington, who was not always happy with the performance of the militias, wrote, [...] "Genl Dickinsons behaviour reflects the highest honour upon him, for tho' his Troops were all raw, he lead them thro' the River, middle deep, and gave the Enemy so severe a charge, that, altho' supported by three field pieces, they gave way and left their Convoy", and only reported the taking of nine prisoners.|$|E
500|$|Honório Hermeto Carneiro Leão (later Marquis of Paraná), one of Brazil's leading {{politicians}} and then serving as president (governor) {{of the province}} of Pernambuco, summarized the prevalent view among Brazil's ruling elite regarding the succession of the Empire when he addressed the Provincial Assembly: [...] "It is my painful duty to <b>inform</b> <b>you</b> {{of the death of}} the Prince Imperial D. Pedro Afonso, which occurred on 10 January of the current year. It is the second time we lose the heir presumptive of the crown." [...] Honório Hermeto continued: [...] "It must serve as a consolation to us, the certainty of [...] health of H. M. the Emperor and his august wife. Both in the prime of their years, and full of life, still promise both numerous fruits from their conjugal bed as well as a male succession to the crown, as required for both the consolidation of our still recent institutions and the restless spirit of the century." ...|$|E

500|$|Moscone {{planned to}} {{announce}} White's replacement on November 27, 1978. A half {{hour before the}} press conference, White avoided metal detectors by entering City Hall through a basement window, and went to Moscone's office, where witnesses heard shouting followed by gunshots. White shot Moscone in the shoulder and chest, then twice in the head. White then quickly walked to his former office, reloading his police-issue revolver with hollow-point bullets along the way, and intercepted Milk, asking him to step inside for a moment. Dianne Feinstein heard gunshots and called police, then found Milk {{face down on the}} floor, shot five times, including twice in the head. Soon after, she announced to the press, [...] "Today San Francisco has experienced a double tragedy of immense proportions. As President of the Board of Supervisors, it is my duty to <b>inform</b> <b>you</b> that both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot and killed, and the suspect is Supervisor Dan White." [...] Milk was 48years old. Moscone was 49.|$|E
500|$|Work for {{the season}} lasted only until 11 September, by which time the barrack legs had been secured {{although}} not the main structure. Less than two months later Stevenson {{received a letter from}} the storekeeper at Hynish, Mr. Hogben. It began: [...] "Dear Sir, I am extremely sorry to <b>inform</b> <b>you</b> that the barrack erected on Skerryvore Rock has totally disappeared." [...] The structure had been destroyed during in a gale on 3 November and four months effort had been wasted. Stevenson hired a boat to take him out to inspect the damage the same day he received this news. Firm in his self-belief, he resolved to build a stronger but otherwise identical replacement. Work began in April 1839 and by early September the completed barrack stood [...] above the rock. Entry was via ladders attached to the legs that led into the lowest level containing a kitchen. The middle level contained two cabins, one for Stevenson, the other for his master of works, whilst the top level provided sleeping quarters for a further 30 to 40 men.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} morning of 24 February 1525, Imperial {{engineers}} opened breaches in the walls of Mirabello, allowing Lannoy's forces to enter the park. At the same time, Leyva sortied from Pavia with {{what remained of the}} garrison. [...] In the ensuing four-hour battle, the French heavy cavalry, which had proven so effective against the Swiss at Marignano ten years prior, masked its own artillery by a rapid advance and was surrounded and cut apart by landsknechts and d'Avalos's massed Spanish arquebusiers. [...] Meanwhile, a series of protracted infantry engagements resulted in the rout of the Swiss and French infantry. [...] The French suffered massive casualties, losing the majority of their army. Bonnivet, Jacques de la Palice, La Trémoille, and Richard de la Pole were killed, while Anne de Montmorency, Robert de la Marck, and Francis himself were taken prisoner along with a host of lesser nobles. [...] The night following the battle, Francis gave Lannoy a letter to be delivered to his mother in Paris, in which he related what had befallen him: [...] "To <b>inform</b> <b>you</b> of how the rest of my ill-fortune is proceeding, all is lost to me save honour and life, which is safe." [...] Soon afterwards, he finally learned that the Duke of Albany had lost the larger part of his army to attrition and desertion, and had returned to France without ever having reached Naples. [...] The broken remnants of the French forces, aside from a small garrison left to hold the Castel Sforzesco in Milan, retreated across the Alps under the nominal command of Charles IV of Alençon, reaching Lyon by March 1525.|$|E
