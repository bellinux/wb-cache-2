It describes the monetary developments in 2003 – 05 and reform of the financial system. The paper examines the impact of monetary and exchange rate policies on inflation, including {{the nature of the}} lags involved. It reviews developments in the DRC’s mining sector and mining’s contribution to the economy from a fiscal perspective, showing a low <b>effective</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation.</b> The paper also discusses restructuring of the mining sector.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{concentrate}} to calculate effective tax rates on investments in twenty countries since 1981 and five Eastern Europe countries since 1991. However we first solve the effective marginal tax {{rate and the}} effective average tax rate from the discrete investment model - including immediate depreciation allowance, valuation method of inventories and wealth taxation - that a firm maximizes value of its equity in. We compute the effective tax rates {{at the level of}} a firm and an investor. We converse on properties and applicability of different tax rates in the paper. It is good to mention that the effective marginal tax rate is more suitable for measuring tax burden of a marginal investment and the effective average tax rate is better to measure effective tax rates of a new investment that earn more than a minimum required rate of return. The latter ''emphasizes'' taxation of distributed profits - corporate tax rates, taxation of capital gains and dividends and imputation credit on dividends - while the first is more sensitive to tax allowances. We refer shortly to conversation of tax policy and some results of tax theory with the empirical results. The <b>effective</b> <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> on the last investment unit has fallen and even faster in the small countries during the period of the study. The capital import and export neutrality have increased - at least a bit. However it is a lot {{to do in order to}} improve neutrality - also neutrality of taxation on capital assets and sources of finance - in all the countries of the research. The effective tax rates of Finland are quite favourable - especially the effective average tax rates - and the neutrality of the Finnish capital taxation is at the average level. Endast sammandrag.

40|$|An {{important}} source of concern about corporation tax regimes within the European Union {{is the extent to}} which differences in regimes between member states generate production inefficiency. This paper analyzes the tax regimes in the 15 EU member states. It identifies the extent to which they differ by presenting two summary measures: the cost of capital and the effective average tax rate. It also identifies how these measures would be affected by alternative forms of harmonization within the EU, such as a common corporation tax rate or tax base. Such simulations serve a dual purpose. They identify the impact of potential policies, but, more generally, they show how differences in <b>effective</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> between countries depend on specific aspects of the tax regimes...|$|R
40|$|Objective] Every year ZEW Mannheim computes {{measures}} <b>of</b> corporate effective <b>taxation</b> in Europe {{based on}} the Devereux/Griffith methodology. The measures aim at comprehensively reflecting and consistently comparing the <b>effective</b> corporate tax <b>levels</b> in the different member states. For the computation of the effective tax rates, assumptions on economic parameters {{have to be made}} - in particular on the values of the inflation and interest rate. Common assumptions on these variables are strictly necessary in order to compare <b>effective</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> across countries in a meaningful way. In some cases these assumptions could interact with the effects of specific tax parameters on the effective tax burdens. For example, capital allowances become less effective in reducing tax burdens in inflationary environments. As a consequence, countries with high capital allowances appear more attractive when inflation is low. This study aims at analysing and quantifying the effect of the real interest and inflation rate on effective tax measures...|$|R

40|$|This study {{presents}} estimates <b>of</b> the <b>effective</b> <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> company <b>taxation</b> in the 15 Member States of the EU. The {{study is}} established {{from the perspective}} of a multinational investor and provides relevant qualitative and quantitative information about the company tax regimes in the EU Member States which are in force in 2001. The main aim of the study is to compute and to compare effective marginal tax rates (EMTR) on domestic investment in all 15 EU Member States. A secondary aim is to work out the impact of the different tax drivers on the effective tax burden, i. e. to analyse how the EMTRs of the Member States are influenced by the tax systems, the different types of profit and non-profit taxes, the tax bases and the tax rates. The computation of the EMTR and the quantitative analysis is based on the well known approach of King and Fullerton which is also used, for example, in international tax burden comparison by the OECD and the European Commission. We refer to a typical manufacturing company as a base case. This company – which has the legal structure of a corporation – is characterised by a particular combination of investments and forms of finance. We considered five different types of investment: intangibles, industrial buildings, machinery, financial assets and inventories. The financing policy considered three sources of finance: new equity capital, retained earnings and debt. The calculations take into account the most relevant tax provisions. Relating to company taxation, we considered the corporation tax, additional profit taxes and non-profit taxes, the tax rates and the most relevant aspects of the tax base. Chapter B presents a brief and well structured overview on the company tax regimes in the EU Member States...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss {{the effects of a}} Transaction Tax on an {{artificial}} market with varying liquidity where a large number of agents can trade a share of a risky asset. A market maker is in charge to optimally set the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> in order to obtain a desired mixture of activity and volatility. We show that, depending on the liquidity of the market, two possible regimes <b>of</b> optimal <b>taxation</b> emerge: a non-negligible <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> for highly liquid markets and low (close to zero) <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> for low liquidity markets.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} withholding {{taxes and}} information exchange as alternative means to tax international interest income. For each regime, {{we consider the}} maximum <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> foreign-source income that can be sustained as the equilibrium of a repeated game. The best regime {{is the one that}} brings the <b>level</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> in the repeated game closest to the cooperative <b>level</b> <b>of</b> interest <b>taxation.</b> Sustainable <b>levels</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> in either regime depend on the importance of bank profits and on the marginal cost of public funds, among other things. Simulations with the model illustrate the choice between withholding taxes and information exchange. An explicit possibility is the emergence of a mixed regime, with one country imposing a withholding tax and the other country providing information. The basic model is extended to allow for size differences between the two countries and to incorporate a third, outside country. ...|$|R
