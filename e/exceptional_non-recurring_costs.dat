40|$|The {{development}} of reusable launch vehicles is a continued priority {{in an effort}} to reduce cost, increase responsiveness, and avoid expending expensive rocket hardware. Reusing an EELV booster engine combines reusability, proven launch vehicles, and EELV-sized payload capacity. In addition to cost reductions, it allows for flexibility in engine production rate. This paper outlines how the reusable launch vehicle community can utilize partial reusability options on Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicles (EELVs) as a springboard for long-term developments and proposes that in addition to the pursuit of responsive, reusable boosters for small payloads, partial reusability be developed for EELV-sized payloads. Many approaches to booster recovery have been considered in the past. Flyback boosters suffer from huge <b>non-recurring</b> <b>cost</b> and large performance impact.

40|$|By a {{field study}} of an Airbus Group {{subsidiary}} {{in combination with}} a review of extant literature this work examined strategic sourcing in the aerospace industry and the associated implementation challenges and obstacles. The case study observations {{were consistent with the}} literature-based conception that extremely long product cycles, in combination with relatively high <b>non-recurring</b> <b>costs,</b> and a need for strong quality control can be considered as distinctive features of the industry. Those characteristics benefit the application of long-term partnerships and a relative absence of multiple sourcing. However regarding implementation it became apparent that the case company is susceptible to issues that are related to its origin and hamper this approach. Amongst others those are a historically grown production setup focused on mainly vertical integrated operations with the associated insufficient ERP systems, limited transformation capabilities and capacities that coincide with ramp-up challenges while the impact of backlogs and delivery failure is extreme, and short-term cost pressure. This problematic context can be considered similar for other incumbent aerospace companies – especially from Europe - which have comparable origins and also face the same industry-wide challenges. Hence also implementation - and not only determination - of sourcing strategies may be considered a main issue in this context...|$|R

40|$|Cost control must be {{implemented}} through {{the establishment of}} requirements and controlled continually by managing to these requirements. Cost control of the non-recurring side of life cycle cost has traditionally been implemented in both commercial and government programs. The government uses the budget process to implement this control. The commercial approach {{is to use a}} similar process of allocating the <b>non-recurring</b> <b>cost</b> to major elements of the program. This type of control generally manages through a work breakdown structure (WBS) by defining the major elements of the program. If the cost control is to be applied across the entire program life cycle cost (LCC), the approach must be addressed very differently. A functional breakdown structure (FBS) is defined and recommended. Use of a FBS provides the visibifity to allow the choice of an integrated solution reducing the cost of providing many different elements of like function. The different functional solutions that drive the hardware logistics, quantity of documentation, operational labor, reliability and maintainability balance, and total integration of the entire system from DDT&E through the life of the program must be fully defined, compared, and final decisions made among these competing solutions. The major drivers of recurring cost have been identified and are presented and discussed. The LCC requirements must be established and flowed down to provide control of LCC. This LCC control will require a structured rigid process similar to the one traditionally used to control weight/performance for space transportation systems throughout the entire program. It has been demonstrated over the last 30 years that without a firm requirement and methodically structured cost control, it is unlikely that affordable and sustainable space transportation system LCC will be achieved...|$|R
