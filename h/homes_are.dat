5|$|As {{a result}} of the dry climate, timber—a main {{component}} in building earthquake-resistant homes—is scarce in Qayen; <b>homes</b> <b>are</b> instead constructed of adobe. The inhabitants of the poverty-stricken region rely on subsistence farming, raising livestock and crops such as wheat and saffron. When the earthquake struck, much of the population was already working in the fields; for the most part, these people survived. Many of those treated for injuries were found to be undernourished.|$|E
5|$|August 2, 1995- Hurricane Erin strikes near Vero Beach {{and days}} later near Fort Walton Beach, {{producing}} moderate rainfall including totals of 10.14inches (258mm) in Melbourne and 20inches (560mm) in DeFuniak Springs on the Florida Panhandle. Thousands of <b>homes</b> <b>are</b> damaged near the hurricane's two landfalls, with monetary damage totaling about $700million (1995USD, $990million 2008USD). Rip currents kill a surfer off Palm Beach County, and two people {{die in the}} Gulf of Mexico when their boat capsizes.|$|E
5|$|Black-headed sugar ants are nocturnal foragers of food. The {{species is}} {{sometimes}} considered a household pest since ants can enter human homes {{at night in}} search of food. During the day, these ants are not active and have exhibited sleep-like behaviours until it is night. The black-headed sugar ant predominantly feeds on sweet secretions and sugar water; insects {{and a variety of}} foodstuffs in human <b>homes</b> <b>are</b> also consumed.|$|E

5|$|Category4 hurricanes tend {{to produce}} more {{extensive}} curtainwall failures, with some complete structural failure on small residences. Heavy, irreparable damage and near complete destruction of gas station canopies and other wide span overhang type structures are common. Mobile and manufactured <b>homes</b> <b>are</b> often flattened. Most trees, except for the heartiest, are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas. These storms cause extensive beach erosion, while terrain may be flooded far inland. Total and long-lived electrical and water losses are to be expected, possibly for many weeks.|$|E

50|$|In 1988, Colonial Street was {{overhauled}} for Tom Hanks comedy The 'Burbs. The old Leave It to Beaver <b>home</b> <b>was</b> removed, {{as large}} <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> {{required for the}} movie. Following the movie, the <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> rearranged again so Circle Drive was connected once again. In 1996, a new Leave it to Beaver house was built for the 1997 movie (called the Morrison Home), replacing <b>homes</b> that <b>were</b> built for The 'Burbs movie. Also during this time, the Providence <b>home</b> <b>was</b> built (called the Klopeck House Building). Colonial Street remained unchanged until 2004, when Desperate Housewives used the street for its series production, giving it the name Wisteria Lane. The <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> freshly painted with bright pastel colours and refurbished.|$|R
5|$|September 18, 2003– Hurricane Isabel makes {{landfall}} at Drum Inlet with {{winds of}} 105mph (165km/h) and causes three {{deaths in the}} state, one of which directly. Damage in the state totals $450million, most of which in Dare County where some <b>homes</b> <b>are</b> washed away. The storm surge produces a 2,000-foot (600m) wide inlet on Hatteras Island, isolating Hatteras by road for two months.|$|E
5|$|The Canberra Museum and Gallery in {{the city}} is a {{repository}} of local history and art, housing a permanent collection and visiting exhibitions. Several historic <b>homes</b> <b>are</b> open to the public: Lanyon and Tuggeranong Homesteads in the Tuggeranong Valley, Mugga-Mugga in Symonston, and Blundells' Cottage in Parkes all display the lifestyle of the early European settlers. Calthorpes' House in Red Hill is a well-preserved example of a 1920s house from Canberra's very early days.|$|E
5|$|The {{landline}} telephones in most residential <b>homes</b> <b>are</b> analog—that is, the speaker's voice directly {{determines the}} signal's voltage. Although short-distance calls may be handled from end-to-end as analog signals, increasingly telephone service providers are transparently converting the signals to digital signals for transmission. The {{advantage of this}} is that digitized voice data can travel side-by-side with data from the Internet and can be perfectly reproduced in long distance communication (as opposed to analog signals that are inevitably impacted by noise).|$|E

50|$|Catalog <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> {{mail-order}} kits from Sears Roebuck and Company {{and other}} companies. “Kit” <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> delivered by rail and pieced {{together by the}} owner. The reason for the popularity of kit <b>homes</b> <b>was</b> threefold. The <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> fairly easy to finance, the kits supplied all or {{nearly all of the}} supplies needed to build the home and they mimicked nearly every popular style. One significant advantage of the catalog <b>homes</b> <b>was</b> the ease with which they could be added onto. If the house was built between 1900 and 1940 and bears a resemblance to a particular style, but has differences, it still may <b>be</b> a catalog <b>home.</b>|$|R

5|$|Ann Arbor's {{residential}} neighborhoods contain architectural styles {{ranging from}} classic 19th-century and early-20th-century designs to ranch-style houses. Among these <b>homes</b> <b>are</b> {{a number of}} kit houses built in the early 20th century. Contemporary-style houses are farther from the downtown district. Surrounding the University of Michigan campus are houses and apartment complexes occupied primarily by student renters. Tower Plaza, a 26-story condominium building located between the University of Michigan campus and downtown, is the tallest building in Ann Arbor. The 19th-century buildings and streetscape of the Old West Side neighborhood have been preserved virtually intact; in 1972, the district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places, and it is further protected by city ordinances and a nonprofit preservation group.|$|E
5|$|Antankarana <b>homes</b> <b>are</b> {{typically}} {{raised on}} stilts above ground level. Young men seeking {{to start a}} family typically leave their father's house and build their own from wood and thatch gathered locally. After marrying a young woman will leave her family's home to move into her husband's house, where she manages the household and assists in planting and harvesting rice. The husband is responsible for earning money for basic necessities and farming the family's land. A young couple typically receives furniture and other essentials as wedding gifts from friends, family and community members. Divorce and remarriage are common in Antankarana society.|$|E
5|$|As NY38 enters Auburn, {{it passes}} by Auburn High School before heading north through densely {{populated}} blocks filled with homes. The divided highway ends abruptly at Swift Street, where NY38 turns west {{to follow the}} two-lane undivided Swift Street west for seven blocks to NY34 (South Street). Here, NY38 leaves Swift Street and joins NY34 on South Street. The two routes follow South Street past the William H. Seward House into downtown Auburn, where the <b>homes</b> <b>are</b> replaced with businesses at Lincoln Street. Three blocks later, South Street intersects with the East Arterial (eastbound US20 and NY5). The overlap between NY34 and NY38 ends one block later at the West Arterial (westbound US20 and NY5), where NY38 turns to follow the Arterial for a block to the west.|$|E
50|$|In September 1936, all 25 <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> {{ready for}} occupancy. The <b>homes</b> <b>were</b> very simple. There was no {{electricity}} or {{running water and}} all the bathrooms were located about thirty feet back in the woods.

50|$|The <b>home</b> <b>was</b> {{built in}} 1796 by Andrew Zabriskie {{as a home}} for his son John Zabriskie. The <b>home</b> <b>was</b> later used as a parsonage. In 1890 the <b>home</b> <b>was</b> {{converted}} into a tavern. The borough of Ho-Ho-Kus purchased the home in 1941 and began leasing the home as a restaurant in 1953.|$|R
50|$|After {{being passed}} on to the Schumacher's {{descendants}} the <b>home</b> <b>was</b> sold in 1967 (though it remained a private home). During the 1998 Comfrey-St. Peter tornado outbreak the <b>home</b> <b>was</b> badly damaged including the complete loss of the home's turret, roof and porch. In a yearlong restoration project aided by the Minnesota Historical Society the <b>home</b> <b>was</b> meticulously restored. The <b>home</b> <b>was</b> added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2000 as an excellent local example of a Queen Anne style home.|$|R
5|$|August 24, 1992 - Hurricane Andrew makes {{landfall}} on Homestead, {{just south}} of Miami, as a Category Five hurricane with winds of 165mph (265km/h). The winds destroy 25,524homes and damage 101,241 others in southern Florida, leaving up to one-quarter million people temporarily homeless. In Homestead, more than 99% of all mobile <b>homes</b> <b>are</b> completely destroyed. Hurricane Andrew causes $25.5billion in damage (1992USD, $39.2billion 2008USD) in south Florida and 15 direct deaths. At the time, Andrew is the costliest North Atlantic hurricane {{in the history of}} the United States, though has since dropped to fifth after Hurricanes Katrina, Ike, Sandy, and Harvey.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{is highly}} {{unlikely}} that single-story structures such as mobile homes can have a substantial effect on tornado development or evolution. More people are killed in trailer parks because mobile <b>homes</b> <b>are</b> less able to withstand high winds than permanent structures. Winds which can demolish or roll a mobile home may only cause roof damage to a typical one- or two-family permanent residence. Another likely contributing factor to the continued propagation of this myth is confirmation bias: whenever a new instance of a tornado hitting a mobile home park occurs, media outlets report on it more extensively, ignoring damage to the surrounding area which may not have produced as many casualties.|$|E
5|$|Students {{living on}} campus occupy a {{dormitory}} {{referred to as}} the , although its correct name is Astraea Dormitory, named after Astraea Hill. The building is a triangular shape, allowing for the segregation of students from the three schools; each section is about the same size. It was built about 100years before the story begins, around the same time that Miator was established, for students whose <b>homes</b> <b>are</b> far away. Each student is assigned a roommate in their year until graduation. If there is an odd number of students enrolled in a given year, one of the new students must live alone until a student in their year transfers into their school.|$|E
