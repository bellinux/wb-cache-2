40|$|Onset and {{development}} of puberty is regulated by the neuroendocrine system. Population-based studies worldwide have observed secular trends towards earlier puberty development. These changes are apparently caused by environmental factors such as improved socio-economic status, improved health care and nutrition. However, they may also partly result from <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>chemicals</b> in the environment. Epidemiological studies have investigated the relationship between pubertal development and exposure to <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>chemicals</b> (polychlorinated biphenyls, polybrominated biphenyls, 1, 1, 1 -trichloro- 2, 2 -bis(p-chlorophenyl) ethane, phthalate esters, furans and the pesticide endosulfan). Associations with both perinatal and postnatal exposure have been reported. Studies in experimental animals support some of these findings and point to differential endocrine regulatory mechanisms linked to pubertal development acting in the perinatal and the pre-pubertal period. Pubertal development is naturally associated with growth and body composition. There is increasing evidence for a link between prenatal development and pubertal onset. In girls born small for gestational age (SGA), pubertal onset and age at menarche often are advanced, especially {{if there has been}} an extensive catch-up growth during the first months of life. In utero growth retardation may have multiple causes including exposure to xenobiotic substances as was suggested for some <b>endocrine-disrupting</b> <b>chemicals.</b> An abnormal perinatal environment of children born SGA may alter the endocrine status and the sensitivity of the receptors for endocrine and metabolic signalling that may have effects on maturation of brain and gonads.
