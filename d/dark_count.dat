50|$|Besides photon-generated {{carriers}}, thermally-generated carriers (through generation-recombination processes {{within the}} semiconductor) can also fire the avalanche process. Therefore, {{it is possible}} to observe output pulses when the SPAD is in complete darkness. The resulting average number of counts per second is called <b>dark</b> <b>count</b> rate and is the key parameter in defining the detector noise. It is worth noting that the reciprocal of the <b>dark</b> <b>count</b> rate defines the mean time that the SPAD remains biased above breakdown before being triggered by an undesired thermal generation. Therefore, in order to work as a single-photon detector, the SPAD must be able to remain biased above breakdown for a sufficiently long time (e.g., a few milliseconds, corresponding to a count rate well under a thousand counts per second, cps).|$|E

40|$|Digital Silicon Photomultipliers (dSiPM) are novel light {{detector}} that integrates single-photon avalanche photodiodes and CMOS logic {{into a single}} silicon chip and {{have been used for}} developing new, high performance detectors for Positron Emission Tomography (PET). As a solid-state devices they suffer from thermal excitation what leads to the appearance of noise events called <b>dark</b> <b>counts.</b> However, it is unclear what effect the <b>dark</b> <b>counts</b> have on the count rate performance of dSiPM. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the event loss caused by these <b>dark</b> <b>counts</b> and to come up with optimal configuration of these devices. Here, the effects of <b>dark</b> <b>counts</b> on the performance of are evaluated. Due to the trigger architecture of dSiPM, <b>dark</b> <b>counts</b> cause start of acquisition sequence of the device. Processing of these <b>dark</b> <b>counts</b> leads to dead time of dSiPM what cause the loss of true gamma events. We studied how trigger level, validation level and validation length influence the loss of events due to <b>dark</b> <b>counts.</b> We found that validation time should be kept long (40 ns) to minimize the loss of events. Use of high trigger level and validation level also reduce the event loss caused by <b>dark</b> <b>counts.</b> However, with the high validation level, detection of events with low number of optical photons is reduced as it more difficult for these events to pass the validation threshold. The RTL refresh option was also tested to reduce the effect of <b>dark</b> <b>counts.</b> We found that this option resulted in the achieving maximum sensitivity, i. e. the highest fraction of correctly recorded true events, of dSiPM regardless of used validation and trigger levels. In cases when the scintillation light is spread over several dies, we found that the use of RTL refresh option combined with a low validation level in order to guarantee the individual validation of all required dies ensures higher sensitivity than the use of Neighbor Logic (NL). Finally we verified the dead time of dSiPM and found that is longer than specified and equal to 50 ns...|$|R

40|$|Single-photon {{detectors}} {{based on}} avalanche photodiodes (SPAD) are {{key elements of}} many modern highly sensitive optical systems. One of the bottlenecks of such detectors is a afterpulsing effect which limits a detection rate and requires an optimal hold-off time. In this letter we propose a novel approach for statistical analysis of SPAD <b>dark</b> <b>counts</b> and we demonstrate its usefulness for the search of the experimental condition where the afterpulsing effect can be strongly eliminated. This approach exploits a sequence of ranked time intervals between the <b>dark</b> <b>counts</b> and does not contain a complex mathematical analysis of the experimental data.

50|$|The superconducting {{nanowire}} single-photon detector (SNSPD) {{is based}} on a superconducting wire cooled well below the superconducting transition temperature and biased with a dc current that is close to but less than the superconducting critical current. The SNSPD is typically made from ≈ 5 nm thick niobium nitride films which are patterned as narrow nanowires (with a typical width of 100 nm). Absorption of a photon breaks Cooper pairs and reduces the critical current below the bias current. A small non-superconducting section across the width of the nanowire is formed. This resistive non-superconducting section then leads to a detectable voltage pulse of a duration of about 1 nanosecond. The main advantages of this type of photon detector are its high speed (a maximal count rate of 2 GHz makes them the fastest available) and its low <b>dark</b> <b>count</b> rate. The main disadvantage is the lack of intrinsic energy resolution.|$|E

50|$|One other {{effect that}} can trigger an {{avalanche}} {{is known as}} afterpulsing. When an avalanche occurs, the PN junction is flooded with charge carriers and trap levels between the valence and conduction band become occupied {{to a degree that}} is much greater than that expected in a thermal-equilibrium distribution of charge carriers. After the SPAD has been quenched, there is some probability that a charge carrier in a trap level receives enough energy to free it from the trap and promote it to the conduction band, which triggers a new avalanche. Thus, depending {{on the quality of the}} process and exact layers and implants that were used to fabricate the SPAD, a significant number of extra pulses can be developed from a single originating thermal or photo-generation event. The degree of afterpulsing can be quantified by measuring the autocorrelation of the times of arrival between avalanches when a <b>dark</b> <b>count</b> measurement is set up. Thermal generation produces Poissonian statistics with an impulse function autocorrelation, and afterpulsing produces non-Poissonian statistics.|$|E

However, having a reduction in <b>dark</b> <b>counts</b> does not benefit the eavesdropper because QKD security proofs attribute all losses and errors to the eavesdropper while assuming Bob’s apparatus to be error-free [24].|$|R

An inherent limit to GM-APD sensitivity is the noise caused by thermally generated carriers.
