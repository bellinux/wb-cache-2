5|$|Scully {{then turns}} up mysteriously at a {{hospital}} in a coma. An out of control Mulder demands to know how she <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> is escorted out by security but later calms down and meets with Dr. Daly (Jay Brazeau), who reveals that no one can figure out how she got there or what's wrong with her. He tells Mulder and Mrs. Scully that she has a living will that dictates she be taken off of life support when her condition falls to specific criteria. At Scully's bedside, Mulder meets her older sister Melissa (Melinda McGraw). Scully has a vision of sitting in a boat, attached by rope to a dock where Mulder and Melissa stand, and nurse Owens behind them. Frohike visits Scully and sneaks out her medical chart, which the Lone Gunmen later investigate. Byers finds that Scully's blood contains branched DNA that may have been used for identification but now is inactive and nothing more than a poisonous waste product in her system.|$|E
25|$|Caesar's commanders {{followed}} different paths. Labienus {{sided with}} the Optimates, the conservative aristocratic faction Caesar fought against in his civil war, and was killed at the Battle of Munda in 45 BC. Caius Trebonius, one of Caesar's most trusted lieutenants, was appointed consul by Caesar in 45 BC, {{and was one of}} the senators involved in Caesar's assassination on the Ides of March (March 15), 44 BC. He was himself murdered a year later. Caius Fabius held up the Pompeian forces at Ilerda until Caesar <b>got</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> won the Battle of Ilerda in 49 BC. Decimus Junius Brutus Albinus was entrusted with fleet operations by Caesar during his civil war. He was put in charge of the naval blockade of Massilia (Marseilles) during the Siege of Massilia by Caesar's forces. He built a fleet from scratch and secured the capitulation of the city. He, too, joined the conspiracy to assassinate Caesar. Marc Antony continued to be a faithful supporter of Caesar. He was made Caesar's second in command, as Master of the Horse, in 47 BC during Caesar's second dictatorship and was left in charge in Italy. He mishandled a political issue and deployed troops against a crowd in Rome. Caesar stripped him of his office. He received no appointments in 46 BC and 45 BC. In 44 BC he was elected as Caesar's consular colleague. After Caesar's murder, Antony was part of the Second Triumvirate, an alliance with two other Caesarians, Octavian and Lepidus. Marc Antony and Octavian defeated the forces of the assassins of Caesar in the Liberators' civil war. Later Octavian declared war on Cleopatra VII of Egypt in order to fight Marc Antony, her ally and lover. They were defeated at the Battle of Actium in 31 BC. They went back to Egypt. Marc Antony was defeated again and the two committed suicide.|$|E
500|$|During {{the album}} production, Townshend made many field {{recordings}} with a portable reel-to-reel recorder. These included waves washing on a Cornish beach and the doppler whistle of a diesel train recorded near Townshend's house at Goring-on-Thames. The ending of [...] "The Dirty Jobs" [...] includes a musical excerpt from a brass band performance of The Thunderer by John Philip Sousa, which Nevison recorded in Regent's Park. Assembling the field recordings {{in the studio}} was problematic; at one point, during [...] "I Am the Sea", nine different tape machines were running sound effects. According to Nevison, Townshend produced the album single-handedly, adding that [...] "everything started when Pete <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> everything finished when Pete left". Townshend began mixing the album in August at his home studio in Goring along with Nevison.|$|E

I thought that that would still work as a visual, but then we <b>got</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> it was like 20 degrees below zero, it was bitterly cold, and I was barefoot. I was barefoot for the entire video, and then it started pouring rain and everyone got really sick, and it just actually {{turned out to be a}} really miserable experience.|$|E
500|$|Bill Clinton {{has given}} dozens of paid speeches each year since leaving office in 2001, mostly to {{corporations}} and philanthropic groups in North America and Europe; he often earned $100,000 to $300,000 per speech. Hillary Clinton {{said that she}} and Bill {{came out of the}} White House financially [...] "broke" [...] and in debt, especially due to large legal fees incurred during their years in the White House. [...] "We had no money when we <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> we struggled to, you know, piece together the resources for mortgages, for houses, for Chelsea's education." [...] She added, [...] "Bill has worked really hard... we had to pay off all our debts... he had to make double the money because of, obviously, taxes; and then pay off the debts, and get us houses, and take care of family members." ...|$|E

When speaking about his directorial experience with The Office, Reitman stated that [...] "Anyhow, the whole experience was awesome. They’re all geniuses over there. I didn’t have to contribute much {{at the end of}} the day because they’re all so on their game." [...] He also stated that [...] "Weird moment of production design surprise – There's a three ring binder on Creed's desk with the logo from the Academy of Tobacco Studies that we created for [...] Smoking.

500|$|Constant {{strumming}} with {{a guitar}} pick {{over the decades}} has worn a large sweeping hole into the guitar's body near the sound hole—the N-20 has no pick-guard since classical guitars {{are meant to be}} played fingerstyle instead of with picks. Its soundboard has been signed by over a hundred of Nelson's friends and associates, ranging from fellow musicians to lawyers and football coaches. The first signature on the guitar was Leon Russell's, who asked Nelson initially to sign his guitar. When Nelson was about to sign it with a marker, Russell requested him to scratch it instead, explaining that the guitar would be more valuable in the future. Interested in the concept, Nelson requested Russell to also sign his guitar. In 1991, during his process with the IRS, Nelson was worried that Trigger could be auctioned off, stating: [...] "When Trigger goes, I'll quit". He asked his daughter, Lana, to take the guitar from the studio before any IRS agent <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> bring it to him on Maui. Nelson then hid the guitar in his manager's house until his debt was paid in 1993.|$|E
500|$|The track's lyrics, {{structured}} in verse–chorus form and written in second person narrative, predominantly feature a sarcastic tone. They {{were inspired by}} Williams' decision to move from Nashville to Los Angeles. She considered this idea after feeling overwhelmed by the repercussion, in Nashville, of Josh and Zac Farro's departure from Paramore. Williams said, [...] "I took off for L.A. {{as if it was}} going to be some kind of paradise or saving grace. I <b>got</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> realized that my problems were following me. Okay, so I was having a bad six months? Get over it. [...] " [...] The song was penned as a message regarding her behavior, in order for her to cope with her decision. She stated, [...] "No one else was saying that to me, so I had to say it to myself." [...] musicOMH's Thomas Ingham interpreted its lyrics as focusing on a [...] "serious 'all alone in the world'" [...] theme, while Corvallis Gazette-Timess journalist called them [...] "blunt" [...] and wrote that they discuss [...] "growing up". The writer also believed that its theme would make the song a prominent track at graduation ceremonies. Atilano viewed a contrast between the song's melody and lyrical content. However, he noted that its [...] "sunny" [...] sonority made it [...] "pleasant" [...] to hear.|$|E
500|$|The first {{image the}} Coens and Raimi {{conceived}} was of Norville Barnes about {{to jump from}} the window of a skyscraper and then they had to figure out how he <b>got</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> how to save him. The inclusion of the hula hoop came {{as a result of a}} plot device. Joel remembers, [...] "We had to come up with something that Norville was going to invent that on the face of it was ridiculous. Something that would seem, by any sort of rational measure, to be doomed to failure, but something that on the other hand the audience already knew was going to be a phenomenal success." [...] Ethan said, [...] "The whole circle motif was built into the design of the movie, and that just made it seem more appropriate." [...] Joel: [...] "What grew out of that was the design element which drives the movie. The tension between vertical lines and circles; you have these tall buildings, then these circles everywhere which are echoed in the plot...in the structure of the movie itself. It starts with the end and circles back to the beginning, with a big flashback." [...] It took the Coens and Raimi three months to write the screenplay. As early as 1985, the Coens were quoted as saying that an upcoming project [...] "takes place in the late Fifties in a skyscraper and is about Big Business. The characters talk fast and wear sharp clothes." ...|$|E

500|$|Waugh {{arrived at}} Boa Vista on 4 February 1933, to find no boats {{available}} {{to take him}} on to Manaus. Days of inactivity and boredom followed, with [...] "nothing to read except some lives of the Saints in French and Boussuet's sermons". Waugh passed {{some of the time}} by writing a short story; although not identified in the diaries, this story has been generally accepted as [...] "The Man Who Liked Dickens". Apart from using different names and some minor details this story {{is the same as the}} episode that Waugh later used as the climax to A Handful of Dust: an elderly settler (modelled in manner, speech and appearance on Christie), rescues and holds captive a lost explorer and requires him to read aloud the novels of Dickens, in perpetuity. The story was published in 1933, in America in Hearst's International–Cosmopolitan, and in Britain in Nash's Pall Mall Magazine. In an article written many years later, Waugh explained how the story became the basis for his next novel: [...] "The idea [...] came quite naturally from the experience of visiting a lonely settler ... and reflecting how easily he could hold me prisoner. Then, after the short story was written and published, the idea kept working in my mind. I wanted to discover how the prisoner <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> eventually the thing grew into a study of other sorts of savage at home and the civilized man’s helpless plight among them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Dust Brothers had a {{bunch of}} music {{together}}, before we arrived to work with them. As a result, a lot of the tracks come from songs they'd planned to release to clubs as instrumentals – [...] "Shake Your Rump," [...] for example. They'd put together some beats, basslines and guitar lines, all these loops together, and they were quite surprised when we said we wanted to rhyme on it, because they thought it was too dense. They offered to strip it down to just beats, but we wanted all of that stuff on there. I think half of the tracks were written when we <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> the other half we wrote together." ...|$|E

2500|$|An earlier {{agreement}} {{stated that}} {{each member of}} the LLC would only receive [...] "sole compensation for many years of service, a golden parachute of $20,000." [...] But the members now agreed to an arrangement whereby {{each member of the}} LLC would receive an undisclosed sum prior to the transfer of their ownership rights to the Burning Man Project. Marian Goodell, board member and head of communication, addressed concerns about the lack of transparency with this statement: [...] "When you’re {{in the middle of a}} storm, if you’re going to explain all of how you <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> how you’re going to get out, it often sets more panic among the survivors than if you just sail the boat out of the darkness." ...|$|E

[...] In the end, I would go to work early, before anyone <b>got</b> <b>there,</b> <b>and</b> I would just kill the animals myself. Because I couldn't stand to let them go through that. I must have killed a thousand of them, sometimes dozens every day. Some of those people would take pleasure in making them suffer. Driving home every night, I would cry just thinking about it.

[...] The band recorded [...] "an album's worth of material" [...] in Marfa, but ultimately abandoned the majority of tracks. Vocalist Ed Droste noted, [...] "We were like, 'We're ready to do this!' Then, we <b>got</b> <b>there</b> <b>and</b> recorded twelve songs and were like, 'This isn't quite there.'" [...] Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen elaborated, [...] "We didn't have that unspoken momentum, that unspoken understanding of what everyone is into."
