500|$|On December 14, 1962, the Bills outbid the Green Bay Packers for Notre Dame quarterback Daryle Lamonica. In 1963, a four-season {{starting}} quarterback battle began that continued until Lamonica {{left for the}} Raiders. Lamonica felt he [...] "...learned a lot from Jack about quarterbacking. [...] And <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> that we were a great one-two punch at the position for the Bills." [...] In 1963, Kemp led the Bills from a slow start to a tie for the AFL Eastern Division lead with a 7–6–1 record. Kemp again placed second in passing attempts, completions, and yards, and he also finished second to teammate Cookie Gilchrist in rushing touchdowns. The Bills played the Boston Patriots in an Eastern Division playoff game to determine the division title on December 28 at War Memorial Stadium in Buffalo, New York, in [...] weather. [...] During the game, Buffalo replaced Kemp with Lamonica after falling behind 16–0, but still lost 26–8.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the next}} night's Raw in Ottawa, Michaels {{appeared}} carrying the WWF title belt and performing a segment where he boasted before {{the audience of}} how he beat Hart with his own trademark move in his own country. McMahon gave a televised interview to commentator Jim Ross, explaining his version of events and making the now-infamous statement [...] "Vince McMahon didn't screw Bret Hart. <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> that Bret Hart... screwed Bret Hart." [...] Michaels continued his mocking of Hart in the coming weeks, performed a skit badgering a midget dressed up as Hart.|$|E
2500|$|Director of UNESCO to Vietnam, Katherine Müller, said in Global Education Magazine: [...] "I {{personally}} {{identify with}} UNESCO’s {{values in the}} sense that <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> Education, Culture, Social and Natural Sciences, and Communication and Information {{are some of the most}} powerful drivers for sustainable development and peace, as a sustainable future cannot exist without sustainable peace. Raising awareness, capacity building, promoting understanding and respect for diversity, and fostering opportunities for interaction to find ways to ensure a culture of peace are all actions that will motivate people to become interested in setting peace as a priority for sustainable development." ...|$|E

50|$|At the {{successful}} {{end of the}} campaign, Majewske announced:It's wonderful, I have great faith in {{the people of this}} state. <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believed</b> they would do the right thing. I think that this will say to people that the law didn't work, and we need to be looking in the other direction, toward a drug-free environment for our children. The only {{way to do that is}} to tell them it's illegal.|$|R
5000|$|For Ledley, {{working with}} SEAC {{produced}} an epiphany, concerning both {{his career and}} the potential importance of computers to biomedical research. He recalled: “I had previously realized that although, conceptually, physics equations could be written to describe any biomedical phenomenon, such equations would be so complex {{that they could not}} feasibly be solved in closed form. Thus SEAC would be my panacea, because the equations would become tractable to numerical methods of solutions. Or so <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believed</b> at the time. That was to be my field, application of computers to biomedical problems.” ...|$|R
2500|$|Germany, {{which is}} {{involved}} in the UN-mandated International Security Assistance force in Afghanistan and also heads an international effort improving Afghanistan's police force, has suggested that Afghanistan could potentially lose aid or technical support for reconstruction efforts depending on the outcome of Abdul Rahman's case. German Interior Minister Wolfgang Schäuble has stated [...] "I highly support the idea that we make it clear to Afghanistan, in every way possible, that abiding by and protecting human rights, which Afghanistan is obliged to, includes [...] freedom of religion." [...] Schäuble also said, [...] "We contribute a lot to rebuilding Afghanistan and towards its stability, so <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> that Afghanistan must realize that we insist upon the freedom of religion. You cannot punish people because they change their religion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pulis {{began his}} career at Bristol Rovers where he joined their school of {{football}} excellence in Eastville from Newport YMCA. Pulis cites his time at Eastville as an excellent grounding with his Rovers team mate and friend Ian Holloway also making it in football management. [...] "We learned our trade at a football club with really, really good people who had old fashioned values," [...] <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> that it's {{because of the way}} we were brought up back then that we have managed to go on and achieve what we have done in the game. [...] "The basic principles were drilled into us, {{both on and off the}} pitch. Nothing was given to us and we had to work very, very hard for everything we got." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{accusation}} tarnished Bryant's reputation, as the public's {{perception of}} Bryant plummeted, and his endorsement contracts with McDonald's and Nutella were terminated. Sales for Bryant's replica jersey fell significantly from their previous highs. However, in September 2004, the assault case was dropped by prosecutors after the accuser refused {{to testify in}} the trial. Afterward, Bryant agreed to apologize to her for the incident, including his public mea culpa: [...] "Although <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> this encounter between us was consensual, I recognize now {{that she did not}} and does not view this incident the same way I did. After months of reviewing discovery, listening to her attorney, and even her testimony in person, I now understand how she feels that she did not consent to this encounter." [...] The accuser filed a separate civil lawsuit against Bryant, which the two sides ultimately settled with the specific terms of the settlement being undisclosed to the public.|$|E
5000|$|Following Weiland's death, Billy Corgan of The Smashing Pumpkins posited, [...] "It was STP's 3rd {{album that}} had got me hooked, a wizardly mix of glam and post-punk, and I confessed to Scott, {{as well as}} the band many times, how wrong I'd been in {{assessing}} their native brilliance. And like Bowie can and does, it was Scott's phrasing that pushed his music into a unique, and hard to pin down, aesthetic sonicsphere. Lastly, I'd like to share a thought which though clumsy, I hope would please Scott In Hominum. And that is if you asked me who <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believed</b> were the great voices of our generation, I'd say it were he, Layne, and Kurt." ...|$|R

[...] "That you are without honor I have heard men say, and <b>I</b> may <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> it now that I {{have seen what}} manner of man you are. The most lowly-bred boor in all Lutha {{would not be so}} ungenerous as to take {{advantage}} of his king's helplessness to heap indignities upon him.|$|R
2500|$|Obama's win in Iowa {{was seen}} as a boost to his already-improving chances in New Hampshire. On January 4, he told {{supporters}} in New Hampshire, [...] "If you give me the same chance that Iowa gave me last night <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> that I will be the president of the United States of America." [...] The campaign received another boost when former New Jersey senator and 2000 Democratic presidential candidate Bill Bradley endorsed Obama on January 6. At the Democratic debate at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire, on January 5, Obama, Clinton, and Edwards all battled over who best exemplified the buzzword of the campaign, [...] "change". In one key exchange, Clinton said, clearly targeting Obama's rhetorical prowess, [...] "Making change is not about what you believe; it's not about a speech you make. ... We don't need to be raising false hopes." [...] Obama replied that [...] "The truth is, actually, words do inspire. Words do help people get involved." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{was with}} her when she died. She left this world {{literally}} screaming {{at the top of her}} lungs. I {{was with her}} constantly, she lived not even 3 miles from my house, we were together practically every day. She was home for the last few weeks when the doctor told us there was nothing they could do any more. Up until the last two days, she was still moving around. The doctor told us she will leave very quickly and her body will just start to shut down. But when she left, she left the world with a bang, she left it how she lived it. She screamed her way out of here, literally. <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> her survival instincts were so part of her DNA that she was not going to go quietly or willingly. It was just the two of us hanging out [...] she was very funny. We didn't have to [...] because I always knew how she felt about me. I was the love of her life, so the last part of her life we didn't have to have these heart to heart talks.|$|E
2500|$|On July 3, 2009 it was {{announced}} that Storm would be coming out of retirement to perform at two Ring of Honor shows on July 24 and 25, Death Before Dishonor VII: Nights 1 and 2 respectively. On July 24, Storm and fellow Canadian Kevin Steen defeated Chris Hero and Davey Richards and on July 25, Storm was defeated by Hero in a one-on-one grudge match. Following the match, Storm cut an emotional promo, and later announced his belief that this would be his last match, saying [...] "I shared this match with people who share my love and respect for this business, and I am now home being Lance Evers with the family I will share {{the rest of my life}} with. I still have my school, and I will always be a part of this business, but <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> I am now done as a performer. They say, never say never in this business, and because of that I won’t, but I think I left it all in the ring that night and I believe I wrote the final page in the 19-year long book that was the career of Lance Storm." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believed</b> that in {{our village}} I should find {{sensible}} {{people who would be}} glad to hear about interesting things which they never had seen. Many of them had not traveled, and a returned tourist was a comparative rarity in the place. I went down there on purpose to talk about Europe. It was too early for my grandmother's return to the country. I proposed to spend a week with my village friends, and, before their bright firesides, charm and delight them with accounts of those things which had so charmed and delighted me. The lives of city people are so filled with every sort of material that it is useless to try to crowd anything more into them. Here, however, were people with excellent intellects, whose craving for mental pabulum, especially in the winter, could be but partially satisfied.|$|R
5000|$|In late July 2007, guitarist Nuno Bettencourt {{left the}} band, stating, [...] "I {{have always felt}} uncomfortable with the {{direction}} of the lineup and live show. <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> do <b>believe</b> in the songs and music on the album, and I wish Perry Farrell and any musician that remains on tour all the best.” Drummer Kevin Figueiredo also left to join Nuno in reuniting Boston Hard Rock Band Extreme. Silvertide guitarist, Nick Perri, and drummer, Jordan Plonsky, joined the band {{for the remainder of the}} tour.|$|R

The {{partnership}} between one of the industry’s leading jewelry houses and the world’s largest independent international organization running programs in developing and developed countries has generated over AED 98 million and benefited under-privileged children in 23 countries around the globe. [...] El Roumi is responsible for the overall direction, leadership, and coordination of Save the Children programs in Jordan as it was told in the press conference that took place at Al Bustan Hotel- Lebanon, {{in the presence of a}} crowd of Lebanese journalists and dignitaries. The renowned Spanish photographer Fabrizio Ferri has actively supported this initiative with his time and talent. Over the years, he has photographed over 200 celebrities wearing the ring and the pendant in support of Bvlgari’s commitment to quality schooling for the world’s neediest children including Majida, whose poster was officially launched during the press conference. Majida clearly stated during the press conference [...] "I will strive to bring joy to my surroundings and to the people who are in need of it. Everything that's happening is a crime in every meaning of the word. I feel that I have a mission and my appointment is for a cause that <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believe</b> in.

40|$|To be honest, I {{never thought}} I {{would get to}} write this section. The last time I {{actively}} worked on it {{was five years ago}} and at that time I cared deeply about school and the educational process. <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> <b>believed</b> that my college degree would define who I would be. Some time has passed since then, too much time, if you ask my original committee (however, that isn’t hardly possible since all but one of them have retired). But in the five years away from the academic classroom, I enrolled in the classrooms of life. During that time <b>I</b> <b>truly</b> learned about the process of socialization within the prison setting. I’ve spent the last six years knee deep in the daily on-goings and problems associated with life in the correctional setting. In my previous jobs as a correctional officer, correctional case manger, correctional housing unit manager, and quality assurance manager, I’ve been able to listen to stories about what brought men to prison and what has kept them there. It was through first-hand observations that the fire of yearning to understand prisonization and the preparations for release was kept alive. Although many people thought I was insane leaving the cushioned environment of college life to work full-time in a prison, I knew it was a calling. I didn’t want to eve...|$|R
5000|$|After {{the death}} of Scott Weiland, Smashing Pumpkins singer Billy Corgan paid {{official}} tribute to the band and musician, calling {{him one of the}} greatest voices of their generation:"It was, I'd guess you'd say, my way of apology for having been so critical of STP when they appeared on the scene like some crazy, man-fueled rocket. And not only was the knight up front freshly handsome to a fault, but he could sing too! As any supreme actor gives a real and different voice to each character played. It was STP's 3rd album that had got me hooked, a wizardly mix of glam and post-punk, and I confessed to Scott, as well as the band many times, how wrong I'd been in assessing their native brilliance.
