40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} novel Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) method which <b>incorporates</b> <b>appliance</b> usage {{patterns}} (AUPs) {{to improve performance}} of active load identi- fication and forecasting. In the first stage, the AUPs of a given residence were learnt using a spectral decomposition based standard NILM algorithm. Then, learnt AUPs were utilized to bias the priori probabilities of the appliances through a specifically constructed fuzzy system. The AUPs contain likelihood measures for each appliance to be active at the present instant based on the recent activity/inactivity of appliances {{and the time of}} day. Hence, the priori probabilities determined through the AUPs increase the active load identification accuracy of the NILM algorithm. The proposed method was successfully tested for two standard databases containing real household measurements in USA and Germany. The proposed method demonstrates an improvement in active load estimation when applied to the aforementioned databases as the proposed method augments the smart meter readings with the behavioral trends obtained from AUPs. Furthermore, a residential power consumption forecasting mechanism, which can predict the total active power demand of an aggregated set of houses, five minutes ahead of real time, was successfully formulated and implemented utilizing the proposed AUP based technique...|$|R

30|$|Removable {{thermoplastic}} appliances (RTAs) {{can be used}} {{in patients}} as a less visible alternative to conventional, fixed, orthodontic treatment appliances [1 – 4]. Minimal malocclusions, slight arch expansions, and corrections of a deep overbite are indication ranges [5]. Bodily tooth movements are restricted, as aligners primarily transfer forces produced by point contact between the appliance and the tooth [6, 7]. This results mainly in tipping and intrusive movements [6]. Forces required for tooth movement can be generated by local and whole body deformation of the aligner when it is placed onto the dental arch. This deformation results from a discrepancy between the actual and the intended tooth position <b>incorporated</b> into the <b>appliance</b> [7 – 9]. The appliance manufacturing process increases material stiffness by incorporating bends and edges into the aligner. This increase in stiffness is mainly located at the incisal edge [9]. Therefore, it might be appropriate to attenuate the generated force component by inserting cuts into the material in this region.|$|R

Bone remodelling necessary for othodontic tooth movement involves elastic cells, which are tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) positive and which may also be regulated by growth hormone (GH) via its receptor (GHR). The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of a static magnetic field (SMF) on orthodontic tooth movement in the rat. Thirty-two male Wistar rats, 9 weeks old, were fitted with an orthodontic appliance directing a mesial force of 30 g on the left maxillary first molar. The <b>appliance</b> <b>incorporated</b> a weight (NM) or a magnet (M). The animals were killed at 1, 3, 7, or 14 days post-appliance insertion, and the maxillae processed to paraffiin.

The percentage body weight loss/gain, magnetic flux density, tooth movement, width of the periodontal ligament (PDL), length of root resorption lacunae, and hyalinized zone were measured. TRAP and GHR-positive cells along the alveolar bone, root surface, and in the PDL space were counted. The incorporation of a SMF (100 - 170 Gauss) into an orthodontic appliance did not enhance tooth movement, nor greatly alter the histological appearance of the PDL during tooth movement. However significantly greater root resorption (P = 0. 016), increased width of the PDL (P= 0. 017) and greater TRAP activity (P= 0. 001) were observed for group M at day 7 on the compression side.

40|$|Abstract—Induction motors {{are being}} used in greater numbers {{throughout}} {{a wide variety of}} industrial and commercial applications because it provides many benefits and reliable device to convert the electrical energy into mechanical motion. In some applications, it’s desired to control the speed of the induction motor. Because of the physics of the induction motor the preferred method of controlling its speed is to vary the frequency of the AC voltage driving the motor. In recent years, with the microcontroller <b>incorporated</b> into an <b>appliance,</b> it becomes possible to use it to generate the variable frequency AC voltage to control the speed of the induction motor. This study investigates the microcontroller based variable frequency power inverter. The microcontroller provides the variable frequency pulse width modulation (PWM) signal that controls the applied voltage on the gate drive, which provides the required PWM frequency with less harmonics at the output of the power inverter. The fully controlled bridge voltage source inverter has been implemented with semiconductors power devices isolated gate bipolar transistor (IGBT), and the PWM technique has been employed in this inverter to supply the motor with AC voltage. The proposed drive system for three & single phase power inverter is simulated using Matlab/Simulink. The Matlab simulation results of the proposed system were achieved with different SPWM. From the result, a stable variable frequency inverter over wide range has been obtained and a good agreement has been found between the simulation and hardware of a microcontroller based single phase inverter.

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2016 By <b>incorporating</b> {{electrical}} devices, <b>appliances</b> {{and house}} features {{in a system}} that is controlled and monitored either remotely or on-site, smart home technologies have recently gained an increasing popularity. There are several smart home systems already available, ranging from simple on-site home monitoring to self-learning and Wi-Fi enabled systems. However, current systems do not fully make use of recent technological advancement and synergy among a variable number of sensors for improved data collection. For a synergistic system to be provident it needs to be modular and scalable to match exact user needs (type of applications and adequate number of sensors for each application). With an increased number of sensors intelligently placed to optimize the data collection, a wireless network is indispensable for a flexible and inexpensive installation. Such a network requires an efficient medium access control protocol to sustain a reliable system, provide flexibility in design and to achieve lower power consumption. This thesis brings to light practical ways to improve current smart home systems. As the main contribution of this work, we introduce a novel application-specific medium access control protocol able to support suggested improvements. In addition, a smart home prototype system is implemented to evaluate the protocol performance and prove concepts of recommended advances. This thesis covers the design of the proposed novel medium access protocol and the software/hardware implementation of the prototype system focusing on the monitoring and data analysis side, while providing inputs for the control side of the system. The smart home system prototype is Wi-Fi and Web connected, designed and implemented to emphasize system usability and energy efficiency...|$|R

What is Programming? Goodell’s excellent website devoted to end user programming [10] offers definitions of “end user ” and “end user programming”, but not of “programming”. This may not seem a serious omission, as most researchers in computer science use implicit definitions that seem quite adequate for their professional work. Nevertheless, this paper considers the possibility that challenging the implicit professional definitions of programming may generate important insights for the study of end user programming. Programming is in fact seldom defined in modern research publications. An earlier programming textbook from 1959 gives a typical formulation for that time: “This sequence [of basic operations] is called the program and the process of preparing it is called programming ” [32, p. 4]. Programming is the “spadework ” of finding a precise mathematical formulation and method of solution, possibly notated in a “convenient problem-oriented language ” whose symbols are “more closely related to the mathematical problem to be solved”...|$|R

Augmented Reality has started spreading among people with applications of games, sports, tourist places, shopping and even in viewing things which appear invisible in walls. There are number of electrical cables, water pipes, vents passing over, behind a wall. Sometimes when you need to set up new electrical cables or new water pipes connection inside your wall one needs to figure out the existing circuitry of cables and structure of water pipes before piercing a hole. At some places there are large bunch of electrical cables running over while in some places there are number of water pipes there is no such standard for infrastructure of a building. It depends on area and usage number of things that are structure inside wall. One such example is complicated wire mesh in Boeing aircraft. The electrical assembly of aircraft is highly complex which thousands of cables running through it. Using the augmented reality technique, we can view the infrastructure inside wall for that particular wire which is in reality invisible as it hides behind the wall. This thesis shows how to integrate 3 -D virtual objects into a 3 -D real environment in real time. It describes the visualization and planning at different places in a home or offices or any places you may visit. We use Qualcomm's Augmented Reality SDK (QCAR) for a mobile device. In this method, we show that a number of 3 D virtual walls with a certain scale are stored as an Image Target in an application.

40|$|Purpose: The older {{population}} {{is not a}} homogenous group and show significant diversity in constitution, capabilities and experience. In order for new and emerging digital technologies to be inclusive, {{it is crucial to}} encompass this diversity and employ a design process that is sensitive to it. Current approaches to inclusive design tend to seek one design for all, focusing on users who are least engaged with digital technology. In this paper we outline an alternative approach to inclusive design based on co-design with both digitally engaged and unengaged user groups. In our study, as part of a multi-disciplinary group in the New Dynamics of Ageing (UK) funded collaborative research project, older people from different walks of life were invited to four different themed workshops called ‘sandpits’ to explore current and emerging technologies in a playful and creative context to help them envisage the potential implications these technologies can have in their lives as well as to identify key issues and user requirements for further development. This paper will discuss the outcome from three of those sandpits. The themes explored in these three sandpits were 1) Custom computers for older people 2) Supporting Identity and memory in later life and 3) Social connections with new technology. Methods. A total of 66 older people participated in the three sandpits conducted between 2009 and 2010. Separated into PC and non-PC users groups, they were involved in discussions and shown open ambiguous envisionments that responded to the themes through hands-on demonstration, role-play or dramatic enactment of their use. Broadly taking into account the role of technology generations effects, the envisionments were modeled and presented as <b>appliances,</b> <b>incorporating</b> forms of products and interactions that older people are familiar with to encourage in-clusion. The older participants were then involved in the redesign of these envisionments through a collaborative design process. Results and discussion The design responses from older PC and non-PC user groups revealed a difference in the type of embodiment they want for Internet-enabled applications. Both groups redesigned the concepts based on their experience, interests, familiarity with the technology they have and its associated infrastructure or lack thereof. In general, non-PC user groups preferred the appliance nature of the envisionments, and incorporated the functions they were interested in performing, such as capturing spoken stories, sharing photographs, chatting over TV programmes, etc into these appliances. In contrast, PC owners questioned the need for separate appliances and often re-designed them as PC applications or Internet services with emphasis placed on modality and compatibility with their existing infrastructure. The paper will discuss the difficulty and challenge of bridging the gap between the diversity of technology and its users...|$|R
