50|$|At 8:15 am, {{the flight}} {{reported}} that it was starting descent {{and at that time}} was given the San Francisco weather report. Just after 8:21 am ARTC cleared the flight to the San Francisco Instrument Landing System (ILS) Outer Marker beacon via the Half Moon Bay <b>Fan</b> <b>Marker</b> direct to the San Francisco Outer Marker, with instructions to maintain at least 500 ft above all clouds and to contact San Francisco Approach Control after passing the Half Moon Bay <b>Fan</b> <b>Marker.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{accident}} site {{was between the}} Half Moon Bay <b>Fan</b> <b>Marker</b> and the ILS Outer Marker {{and it appears that}} the flight had not maintained at least 500 ft on top of clouds between these points but had descended in weather conditions which precluded reference to the ground.|$|E
50|$|The term <b>fan</b> <b>marker</b> {{refers to}} the older type of beacons used mostly for {{en-route}} navigation. Fan-type marker beacons were sometimes part of a non-precision approach and are identified by a flashing white light and a repeating dot-dash-dot signal. Recent editions of the FAA's AIM publication no longer mention fan markers.|$|E
500|$|The LFR {{also allowed}} {{air traffic control}} to {{instruct}} pilots to enter a holding pattern [...] "on the beam", i.e. {{on one of the}} LFR legs, with the holding fix (key turning point) over the LFR station, in the cone of silence or over one of the <b>fan</b> <b>markers.</b> The holds were used either during the en route portion of a flight or as part of the approach procedure near the terminal airport. LFR holds were more accurate than NDB holds, since NDB holding courses are predicated on the accuracy of the on-board magnetic compass, whereas the LFR hold was as accurate as the LFR leg, with an approximate course width of 3Â°.|$|R
5000|$|On {{some older}} marker beacon receivers, {{instead of the}} [...] "O", [...] "M" [...] and [...] "I" [...] {{indicators}} (outer, middle, inner), the indicators are labeled [...] "A" [...] (or FM/Z), [...] "O" [...] and [...] "M" [...] (airway or <b>Fan</b> and Z <b>marker,</b> outer, middle). The airway marker was used to indicate reporting points along the centerline of now obsolete [...] "Red" [...] airways; this was sometimes a [...] "fan" [...] marker, whose radiated pattern was elongated at right angles across the airway course so an aircraft slightly off course would still receive it. A [...] "Z" [...] marker was sometimes located at low/medium frequency range sites to accurately denote station passage. As airway beacons used the same 3,000 Hz audio frequency as the inner marker, the [...] "A" [...] indicator on older receivers {{can be used to}} detect the inner marker.|$|R
40|$|Determining {{the age of}} {{abandonment}} of alluvial fan surfaces is crucial in relating fan development to past climate change or using <b>fans</b> as strain <b>markers</b> for neotectonic deformation. Cosmogenic surface exposure dating is not readily applicable to fan surfaces of the Lost River Range where large quartz-rich boulders are scarce, and loess has been deposited and eroded. Prior studies have shown, however, that the thickness of dense, laminated pedogenic carbonate pebble coats is useful for relative age and correlation of alluvial fans and moraines. Tributaries Northwest of Mackay, Idaho deliver limestone rich sediment from the Lost River Mountains to the Big Lost River before joining the Snake River south of Arco, Idaho. Numerical 230 Th/U ages of pedogenic carbonate samples from trenches on abandoned and incised sheetflood dominated alluvial fans will date the time of fansurface abandonment. Calcium carbonate coat thicknesses are most developed in the upper-most B-horizon but depositional periods mixed with longer periods of temporary abandonment may complicate the depth of maximum accumulation. Coating thicknesses {{as a function of}} depth were measured in soil profiles developed on Ramshorn and Upper Cedar Creek fan consisting of coarse sand to cobble size clasts overlain by loess. The CaCO 3 coating thicknesses measured from six distinct zones within the subdivided B-horizon can be used to illustrate the zone of maximum calcium carbonate accumulation and the downward thinning of coats there after. Sites judged most stable will compare numerical ages with pedogenic carbonate coating thicknesses to create a soil chronosequence for the Lost River fans...|$|R
5000|$|In addition, {{the flight}} had {{reported}} being over the Half Moon Bay <b>Fan</b> <b>Marker</b> at 8:39 am and then [...] "Southeast, turning inbound" [...] at about 8:42 am. In this time interval {{it would not}} have been possible for the flight at normal speed to have flown from the Half Moon Bay Outer Marker to the ILS Outer Marker, make the required turn and return to the site of the crash in accordance with Civil Aeronautics Authority approved instrument approach procedure. Thus it was likely that when the pilot reported he was [...] "Southeast, turning inbound", he was in fact southwest of the airport.|$|E
