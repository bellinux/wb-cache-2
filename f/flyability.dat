40|$|<b>Flyability</b> is {{the most}} {{discrepant}} trait between modern-day geese and their wild ancestors, and the degeneration of <b>flyability</b> is a key marker of the successful domestication of wild geese. In light of the relatively short history of domestic geese, intense artificial selection is thought {{to play an important}} role in the degeneration of <b>flyability.</b> However, the underlying mechanism behind this phenomenon has seldom been investigated. In this study, we applied a molecular evolutionary approach to the evaluation of partial breeds of domestic geese in order to look for genes involved in the selection pressure toward degeneration of <b>flyability.</b> The haplotype networks, pairwise fixation index (FST) values, and analysis of molecular variance results all clearly illustrated a population variance between Landes geese and partial Chinese domestic geese. We also detected signatures of positive artificial selection in the COX 2 and COX 3 genes, and related selection in the HBB gene. Our results support the independent origins of partial European domestic geese and Chinese domestic geese. In addition, both positive artificial selection and the relaxation of functional constraints appeared to play important roles in the degeneration of <b>flyability</b> in domestic geese...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to {{experimentally}} characterize the <b>flyability</b> of current generation read/write heads over media patterned to densities above the superparamagnetic limit. The superparamagnetic limit is the physical limit to magnetic storage density. In magnetic storage, superparamagnetism is the uncontrollable switching of stored bits during the lifespan of a hard disk. Theoretical analysis has predicted that densities of ~ 50 Gbit/in 2 are not possible using traditional continuous media. One strategy to achieve high storage density, above the superparamagnetic limit, is patterned media. With patterned media the physical separation of magnetic domains increases their stability. One of the major challenges of development of patterned media is achieving acceptable <b>flyability</b> of the read/write head. In that vein, a test stand is built to measure head liftoff speed, head to disk intermittent contact and head fly height. Tangential friction, an indicator of head liftoff is measured by a Wheatstone bridge strain circuit attached to a cantilever beam. Intermittent contact is quantified {{by the amount of}} noise emanating from the interface, which is measured by a high frequency acoustic emission sensor. Head fly height is measured indirectly with a capacitance circuit built around the head to disk interface. Experimental samples of current generation read/write heads and media are obtained from industry. Current generation media is patterned using focused ion beam milling to a density of 10 Gbit/in 2. Other, extremely dense samples, above 700 Gbit/in 2, are created via thin film self assembly on silicon substrate. Conclusions on slider head <b>flyability</b> over patterned media are based on comparison with <b>flyability</b> over non-patterned media. It is demonstrated that loss of hydrodynamic lubrication is small for small pattern regions with high conserved surface area ratio. Conserved surface area ratio is defined as total surface area minus etched surface area all divided by the total surface area of the storage media. For wafer scale patterned media with low conserved surface area ratio, head liftoff cannot be achieved at designed normal load. However, a 50 % reduction of load allows slider head liftoff. M. S.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the early {{development}} of the Anuloid, an innovative disk-shaped VTOL aircraft. The Anuloid concept {{is based on the}} following three main features: the use of a ducted fan powered by a turboshaft for the lift production to take-off and fly; the Coanda effect that is developed through the circular internal duct and the bottom portion of the aircraft to provide further lift and control capabilities; the adoption of a system of ducted fixed and swiveling radial and circumferential vanes for the anti-torque mechanism and the flight control. The early studies have been focused on the CFD analysis of the Coanda effect and of the control vanes; the <b>flyability</b> analysis of the aircraft in terms of static performances and static and dynamic stability; the preliminary structural design of the aircraft.

40|$|A {{paradigm}} shift {{is at hand}} with the planned redesign of the Air Traffic Management and Air Traffic Control systems. The concept for the future air traffic system foresees that aircraft will monitor and maintain separation to each other by themselves in Autonomous Operations Area airspace. With this shift of responsibility for separation assurance from Air Traffic Control to the flight deck crews a more flexible and better airspace usage is expected. Furthermore, through the more flexible airspace usage, a gain in flight efficiency is also anticipated. In order to operate in this airspace area, aircraft are required to be equipped with a system enabling them to detect and resolve air traffic conflicts. Upon detection of a conflict with another aircraft, the system is expected to compute an alternative trajectory which guides the aircraft around the conflict and back to its original trajectory. The alternative trajectory needs to adhere to several requirements, such as being clear of conflicts and being flyable. Further requirements that are often stated are to minimise the additional fuel and time required for the resolution. This thesis is concerned with such a Conflict Detection & Resolution system. Primary focus lies on the resolution of air traffic conflicts while guaranteeing <b>flyability</b> and respecting the Cost Index. The Cost Index is nowadays used by the Flight Management System to optimise the flight profile in respect to the operators prioritisation of fuel-related to time-related costs. This paramter is included into the Conflict Resolution process {{which is based on}} Artificial Force Fields. <b>Flyability</b> of the trajectory is intended to be guaranteed through integration of a flight mechanics model. The algorithm devised in this work is validated in fast time simulations with varying Cost Index. Objects of study are the distance at the Closest Point of Approach, the integration of the Cost Index and the <b>flyability</b> of the resulting trajectory. The first two objects of this study will be validated through comparison of the original and updated trajectory. The new trajectory is considered conflict free if the distance at the Closest Point of Approach is sufficiently large. The lateral, vertical and temporal differences between the two trajectories are used as measures for time- and fuel-related costs. <b>Flyability</b> of the resulting trajectory is validated by confirming adherence to the flight envelope and the constraints given by the flight mechanics model used. The evaluation of the algorithm showed that by integration of a flight mechanics model <b>flyability</b> of the resulting trajectory could be assured. Regarding resolution of the conflicts, the algorithm could compute a trajectory which prevented the initially set up Mid-Air Collision between the aircraft. Though, the minimum required separation could not be achieved in all cases. The approach of integrating the Cost Index into the resolution process showed to be feasible, whereas especially regarding the speed resolution further enhancements {{have been found to be}} necessary...|$|E

40|$|Bit {{patterned}} media (BPM) {{have received}} increased attention {{in recent years}} as the primary candidate for 1 Terabit/in 2 or higher recording density. A patterned media consists of an array of well-defined magnetic nanostructures, each of which can store one bit of data. In the simplest scheme, the structures could be magnetic pillars and dots with a single easy axis of magnetization. The direction of magnetization is interpreted as a binary 1 or 0. Some of the main technical issues in the BPM include the difficulty in fabricating small nano-island arrays in a periodic fashion over large areas, reliability /reproducibility of magnetic bit characteristics, wear and head <b>flyability</b> issue which is associated with the media surface roughness, and processing cost. This thesis deals with investigation of various fabrication approaches, nanostructural features, and magnetic properties for the bit patterned media. In Chapter 1, the science and technology of patterned magnetic recording media are discussed. In Chapter 2, fabrication of an array of high- coercivity magnetic Co/Pd multilayered islands using pre- patterned Si nanopillars template is described. The Si nanopillars have been prepared by advanced electron beam lithography (EBL) and reactive ion etching (RIE). In Chapter 3, the flying instability of the read/write recording head-slider on the topographically rough surfaces of the nano-patterned media is discussed, and technical approaches to overcome such a problem is described, such as planarization of nanopatterned topography by refilling the trenches and flatten the surface of the BPM. I have investigated the head <b>flyability</b> on BPM by fabricating nano pillar geometry with different topography. For <b>flyability</b> testing that requires a relatively large area, I have also fabricated nano pillars on 2. 5 inch glass disks with a distribution of pillar size and periodicity using the "silver ball-up process" and RIE. The process, structure and properties of planarized vs. non-planarized nano fabricated and imprinted BPM, are described in Chapter 4. A Si substrate was spin-coated with a thin PMMA layer, and a periodic island array was made by nano-imprinting lithography (NIL) with the patterned nanofeatures. The subsequent pattern transfer to the Si substrate was performed by using RIE process. A Co/Pd multilayer film was sputtered on the pre- patterned substrate. A HSQ layer was first spin coated on the patterned media to fill the trenches and subsequently re-etched by RIE to remove the overfilled regions on the substrate for planarization. In Chapter 5, the effect of magnetic island geometry on switching field distribution is discusse...|$|E

A control law having longitudinal, lateral, and heading deviation from the synthesized profile in the feedback loops is used for the simulated flight.
