500|$|Though {{considering}} the game [...] "pretty darn tough," [...] IGN praised the game's variety and length. It also praised {{the sound and}} graphics, though the latter {{was a source of}} criticism: [...] "Incomings got it all... but it all comes at a high price: getting this game to run on our PCs was one big pain in the butt." [...] Despite calling it [...] "an outstanding-looking and great playing game," [...] IGN only gave the game a [...] "decent" [...] review score because of the system problems. Conversely, GameSpot's review noted none of these hardware issues, praising the visuals as [...] "some of the finest... of any action game". The reviewer, however, described the game design as [...] "strong yet slightly flawed... definitely pulls you in, but leaves a little to be desired as far as <b>keeping</b> <b>you</b> there," [...] complaining that [...] "what [...] have presented gets tiresome quickly." [...] The publication summarised the game as [...] "a fine game and a definite must-have for arcade fans... What it lacks is a realization that computer games have moved beyond this simplistic style of gameplay".|$|E
500|$|During {{the first}} 12 years, {{the most active}} story with the most {{responses}} posted was the post-2004 US Presidential Election article [...] "Kerry Concedes Election To Bush" [...] with 5,687 posts. This followed {{the creation of a}} new article section, politics.slashdot.org, created at the start of the 2004 election on September 7, 2004. Many of the most popular stories are political, with [...] "Strike on Iraq" [...] (March 19, 2003) the second-most-active article and [...] "Barack Obama Wins US Presidency" [...] (November 5, 2008) the third-most-active. The rest of the 10 most active articles are an article announcing the 2005 London bombings, and several articles about Evolution vs. Intelligent Design, Saddam Hussein's capture, and Fahrenheit 9/11. Articles about Microsoft and its Windows Operating System are popular. A thread posted in 2002 titled [...] "What's <b>Keeping</b> <b>You</b> On Windows?" [...] was the 10th-most-active story, and an article about Windows 2000/NT4 source-code leaks the most visited article with more than 680,000 hits. Some controversy erupted on March 9, 2001 after an anonymous user posted the full text of Scientology's [...] "Operating Thetan Level Three" [...] (OT III) document in a comment attached to a Slashdot article. The Church of Scientology demanded that Slashdot remove the document under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. A week later, in a long article, Slashdot editors explained their decision to remove the page while providing links and information on how to get the document from other sources.|$|E
2500|$|A {{memorial}} plaque {{was erected}} in the crypt of St Paul's Cathedral. [...] The tour guides relate how in 1979, as plaques {{for the other}} great Second World War military leaders were being installed, {{no one in the}} establishment had been in contact with his family for some years. [...] Cathedral officials telephoned to enquire the date of his death only to be told [...] "Auchinleck here – but I won't be <b>keeping</b> <b>you</b> much longer!" [...] A bronze statue of Auchinleck can be seen on Broad Street adjacent to Auchinleck House, Five Ways, Birmingham.|$|E

So I cast him adrift into the flood-water, and he was drawn out to the open, ever wagging his thick black beard like a priest under the pulpit-board. And I saw no more of Himam Singh.|$|R
2500|$|The {{bodies were}} {{returned}} to Acteal {{a few days later}} for a Christmas Day funeral ceremony, presided over by Bishop Samuel Ruiz. [...] Bishop Ruiz, profoundly affected by the massacre, told those at the funeral: [...] "We want to say to you we are <b>keeping</b> <b>you</b> company on this Christmas Day, the saddest Christmas Day of our lives... And we ask our Father Jesus that you remain faithful in your hearts to his word, and that you do not stumble on the stone of temptation of hatred and violence." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Offspring were {{expected}} to begin work on their tenth studio album after the Days Go By tour, and had considered releasing it independently as they had fulfilled their contract with Columbia Records. Guitarist Noodles stated that he hoped they would enter the studio in 2014 to begin recording their new album. Vocalist Dexter Holland stated in a May 2013 interview that he had written a [...] "punk" [...] song about [...] "the government <b>keeping</b> <b>you</b> down." [...] On July 16, 2013 Dexter posted 5 new photos of the recording process to the Offspring's Facebook page titled [...] "In the Studio July 2013", indicating that the band had started work on their new album, which was scheduled for a 2014 release. Like Rise and Fall, Rage and Grace and Days Go By, the new album will be produced by Bob Rock.|$|E
2500|$|The {{business}} of interpretation is obviously very complicated. Literary {{uses of the}} problem of free-will and necessity, for example, may be noticed to give curiously bad arguments and I should think get their strength from <b>keeping</b> <b>you</b> in doubt between the two methods. Thus Hardy is fond of showing us an unusually stupid person subjected to very unusually bad luck, and then a moral is drawn, not merely by inference but by solemn assertion, that we are all in the same boat as this person whose story is striking precisely because it is unusual. The effect may be very grand, but to make an otherwise logical reader accept the process must depend on giving him obscure reasons for wishing it so. It is clear at any rate that this grand notion of the inadequacy of life, so various in its means of expression, so reliable a bass note in the arts, needs to be counted as a possible territory of the pastoral.|$|E

2500|$|IGN {{gave the}} game 9.0 out of 10 and an Editor's Choice Award, praising the game's [...] "pure {{over-the-top}} driving entertainment. The cars and environments are gorgeous, the crashes are spectacular, {{and the new}} Autolog feature breathes {{new life into the}} time-honored tradition of video game competition among friends." [...] Eurogamer gave the game 9 out of 10. Reviewer Tom Bramwell said [...] "It's stuffed with content but rarely for the sake of it, and knowing Criterion it will be handsomely supported for months to come, even though it's already the best pure arcade racing game since Burnout Paradise." [...] GameTrailers also scored the game 9 out of 10. The reviewer stated Hot Pursuit was [...] "excellently crafted, letting you take the world's fastest cars across miles of stunning landscapes. Chases are exhilarating from either perspective, and the autolog feature completely changes how you compete with friends, <b>keeping</b> <b>you</b> hooked until you've wrecked all of their scores." [...] Destructoid gave the game 9.5 out of 10. Reviewer Nick Chester noted that [...] "it delivers a near-perfect competitive experience, in a way that few games - racing or otherwise - can. Hot Pursuit is not only a defining moment for the series, but for arcade-style racing, period." [...] Reviewer Randy Nelson of Joystiq was the second reviewer to give the game a perfect score of 10/10. Reviewer Chris Antista of GamesRadar also gave the game 10 out of 10. Chris stated that [...] "with so many modes and diverse rewards to uncover in Need For Speed: Hot Pursuit, it almost feels like 2.5 games in one package." [...] Electronic Gaming Monthly reviewer Brett Bates gave the game 9.0 out of 10, which felt much the same as GamesRadar's Chris Antista, stating [...] "In effect, you're getting two games in one: What you do as a racer has no bearing on what you do as a cop." ...|$|E
