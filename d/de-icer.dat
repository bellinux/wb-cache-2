5|$|In most countries, winter service {{vehicles}} usually have amber light bars, which are activated {{to indicate that}} the vehicle is operating below the local speed limit or otherwise poses a danger to other traffic, either by straddling lanes or by spreading grit or <b>de-icer.</b> In some areas, such as the Canadian province of Ontario, winter {{service vehicles}} use the blue flashing lights associated with emergency service vehicles, rather than the amber or orange used elsewhere. Many agencies also paint their vehicles in high-contrast orange or yellow to allow the vehicles to be seen more clearly in whiteout conditions.|$|E
5|$|In road {{snow and}} ice control, brine is often used as an anti-icer rather than a <b>de-icer.</b> A vehicle carries a tank of brine, which is sprayed on the road surface before or {{at the onset of}} the storm. This keeps {{snow and ice}} from {{adhering}} to the surface and makes mechanical removal by plows easier. Solid salt is also wetted with brine or other liquid deicer. This speeds de-icing action and helps keep it from bouncing off the pavement into the gutter or ditch. Brine acts faster than solid salt and does not require compression by passing traffic to become effective. The brine is also more environmentally friendly, as less salt is required to treat the same length of road.|$|E
50|$|Direct {{infrared}} heating {{has also been}} developed as an aircraft <b>de-icing</b> technique. This heat transfer mechanism is substantially faster than conventional heat transfer modes used by conventional <b>de-icing</b> (convection and conduction) due to the cooling effect of the air on the <b>de-icing</b> fluid spray.|$|R

25|$|According to Chris Horwill (AREVA T) {{there are}} four main design ratings in the <b>de-icer</b> mode. The first one is the Standard <b>de-icer</b> mode. It works at 250MW and 7200A from ±17.4kV at 10°C. The second one is the Verification mode. It works at 200MW and 5760A from ±17.4kV at 30°C.The third one is the 1-hour overload. This one works at 300MW and 7200A from ±20.8kV at 10°C. The last one is the Low ambient overload. It works at 275MW and 7920A from ±17.4kV at -5°C. KV is the voltage and A is the currents. The range of {{operation}} of the current and voltage is large {{because all of the}} sections have different characteristics.|$|E

25|$|While it is {{generally}} accepted that ongoing use of any <b>de-icer</b> (ice melter) will eventually contribute to some degradation of the concrete surface {{to which it is}} applied, some de-icers are gentler on concrete than others.

500|$|On December 27, 1999, {{the state}} awarded a $85.7million {{contract}} (equivalent to $ in [...] ) for {{the replacement of}} the S-Curve on US131. Deposits of gypsum under the roadway were dissolving and causing it to settle. A deteriorating bridge also forced the reconstruction of the freeway through the area. Construction began on January 15, 2000, diverting the roughly 115,000vehicles per day that used the stretch of road to detours through the downtown area. As part of the project, a $1.2million (equivalent to $ in [...] ) de-icing system was installed. The system is designed to spray a de-icing fluid on the roadway that would be carried by car tires up to a mile (1.6km) along the road surface. This fluid is expected to melt ice at temperatures below the [...] at which salt stops working. [...] Unlike salt, the non-corrosive <b>de-icer</b> does not harm the bridge, but it is more costly. The system is designed to be activated manually, or automatically via sensors along the road. However, plowing would still be required on the roadway. The idea behind the de-icing system is to keep the pavement wet and prevent the formation of ice.|$|E

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is Aircraft Icing and Aircraft Icing and Thermo-Mechanical Expulsion <b>De-icing</b> Technology. The main {{objectives}} are to investigate aircraft icing meteorology and effects on aircraft, ice protection systems and thermo-mechanical expulsion <b>de-icing</b> technology. Initially, the research project focuses on aircraft icing meteorology, ice accumulation and icing effects on flight safety. A {{basic understanding of}} aircraft icing is explained, including icing conditions and parameters, ice detection, ice accretion shapes, and icing effects in terms of different airframe surfaces. Ice protection systems are employed to prevent the icing hazards and ensure flight safety. The conventional and novel ice protection technologies are investigated and their characteristics are explained. Thermo-mechanical expulsion <b>de-icing</b> technology is selected as the research topic because of its typical characteristics of lower power required and high <b>de-icing</b> efficiency. Methods are explored to assess power consumption of thermo-mechanical expulsion <b>de-icing</b> system. In addition, a thermo-mechanical expulsion <b>de-icing</b> system architecture is explored for a civil aircraft and system power consumption is calculated. In order to explain the system design characteristics, conventional electro-thermal <b>de-icing</b> system architecture is designed to show the contrasts in terms of power consumption, <b>de-icing</b> efficiency, cost and mass. This novel ice protection system has better results in power consumption and <b>de-icing</b> performance, allowing long time flight in icing conditions. It can compensate the disadvantages of heavier mass and higher cost {{because there is no}} need to escape from icing encounters immediately and fuel penalties are reduced sequentially...|$|R

2500|$|Because of what {{happened}} in Quebec in the winter of 1998, Hydro-Quebec TransEnergie created a De-icing machine to insure that another event like this wouldn't happen again. The <b>De-icer</b> is a [...] machine that runs a high direct current (DC) into a selected transmission line in order to melt the ice on it. However, because the operation in this mode may be very infrequent, when the installation is not being used as a <b>De-icer</b> it is used as a Static Var Compensator, SVC for short, by using the HVDC valves as a Thyristor Controlled Reactor. An innovative design is used, minimizing the power losses of the valves in SVC mode. The reason an AC current wasn't used is because AC current requires a lot of reactive support. It would take a much higher amount of voltage to push the necessary current through the line.The high voltage system in Quebec runs in two transmission corridors, one high voltage system runs in the north-west from the main load centres of Montreal and Quebec and the other runs north-east along the Saint-Lawrence river. It is the latter corridor that is mainly in an area prone to ice storms that deposit ice on the transmission lines.|$|E
2500|$|In [...] "de-icer" [...] mode, the {{installation}} provides a controlled high current of dc (direct current) power source which feeds a resistive load. The normal current rating in the <b>de-icer</b> mode is 7200 Adc, defines at an ambient temperature of +10°C. The current rating {{is too high}} for a single converter bridge based on present-day HVDC technology. However, with two converter bridges in parallel, the required dc current per bridge can be met with 125mm thyristors used in HVDC converters. With two thyristor converters connected in parallel, there are several possible circuit topologies. The 3 main alternatives considered were: Twelve Pulse Circuit, Double Twelve Pulse Circuit, Double Six Pulse Circuit.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Two {{electro-mechanical}} <b>de-icing</b> {{systems are}} presented, which {{are applied to}} a test specimen consisting of a wing section with an NACA 0012 profile. The test specimen is of a modular design {{to be able to}} substitute the leading edge section for investigating the different <b>de-icing</b> systems. The <b>de-icing</b> tests are performed in the icing wind tunnel of the Institute of Fluid Mechanics of the TU Braunschweig. The first <b>de-icing</b> concept is an electromechanical system based on structural vibrations of the unstiffened sections. Due to piezoceramic actuators and their positions, the skin is excited at its natural frequency. The actuators are placed at the inner side of the leading edge. The second system under investigation is the Electro- Impulse <b>De-Icing</b> concept. Coils placed underneath the upper and lower aluminum skin are supplied with short, high-current impulses which produce opposing time-dependent magnetic fields around coil and skin. The resulting magnetic forces repel the structure which leads to a damped oscillation of the skin. The first aim of this work is to investigate the performance of the two electromechanical <b>de-icing</b> systems under various icing conditions. Operational parameters like temperature and liquid water content are varied. The test results show that the deicing performance of both systems mainly depends on the ice layer thickness and the environmental temperature. The second aim of this work is to investigate the <b>de-icing</b> mechanism of the accumulated ice. Therefore, the <b>de-icing</b> procedure is recorded with a high-speed camera...|$|R

All three boats received modifications to the original Oberon design, which included the enlargement of the snort <b>de-icer,</b> a different weapons fit, a larger air conditioning unit, active sonar and different communications equipment. The second and third hulls were built to Canadian specifications, which moved the galley forward of the control room {{to make room for}} the sonar equipment. This led to the removal of three crew bunks, a problem that was never rectified in the submarines and led to an accommodation issue for the crew.

2500|$|Isopropyl {{alcohol is}} a major {{ingredient}} in [...] "gas dryer" [...] fuel additives. In significant quantities water {{is a problem in}} fuel tanks as it separates from the gasoline and can freeze in the supply lines at cold temperatures. Alcohol does not remove water from gasoline; rather, the alcohol solubilizes water in gasoline. Once soluble, water does not pose the same risk as insoluble water, as it will no longer accumulate in the supply lines and freeze, but will be consumed along with the fuel itself. Isopropyl alcohol is often sold in aerosol cans as a windshield or door lock <b>de-icer.</b> Isopropyl alcohol is also used to remove brake fluid traces from hydraulic braking systems, so that the brake fluid (usually DOT 3, DOT 4, or mineral oil) does not contaminate the brake pads, which would result in poor braking.|$|E
2500|$|The {{required}} power line is configured in de-icing mode {{after being separated}} from their AC circuit. Then, a line de-icing circuit is created {{by a set of}} [...] disconnect switches controlled by the DCU which [...] sends all of the commands to the de-icing converter. The DC current is slowly raised to reach the desired level of current. The de-icing disconnect switches are opened, and the DCU then releases the power line back to the AC network. The lines to be de-iced must stay in normal operation during the entire period of DCU development and start-up. The final installation of the SVC/ <b>de-icer</b> requires a de-icing line equipment pre-operational testing before being installed.The lines being de-iced must stay in normal operation during the start-up as well as throughout the whole period of DCU development. This system is rarely used, only for critical conditions as the operators would be under heavy stress and the man-machine interface (MMI) must be on guided mode. For the five lines being de-iced, there are 13 line topologies that have between 40 and 90 actions per line to be performed during the de-icing process. Out of the five lines, four have three de-icing circuit topologies and the other one only has one. The DCU must offer the possibility to manually confirm the equipment’s state to the operator in order to continue the process as there is always a chance of communication failure. Flexible stimulation sequences used for control logic and MMI validation, pre-operational testing and operator training are required for line equipment and SVC. For 735 kV lines, de-icing takes place in three steps while 315 kV double circuit lines only need one. A DCU supervises and coordinates all the actions required for de-icing each line in order to provide network security and ensure the de-icing sequences are reliable.|$|E
