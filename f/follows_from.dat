50|$|This {{proves the}} Weil conjectures {{for the middle}} cohomology of a variety. The Weil conjectures for the cohomology below the middle {{dimension}} <b>follow</b> <b>from</b> this by applying the weak Lefschetz theorem, and the conjectures for cohomology above the middle dimension then <b>follow</b> <b>from</b> Poincaré duality.|$|R
5|$|Skeptics {{argue that}} the {{connection}} of conspiracy theorists and occultists <b>follows</b> <b>from</b> their common fallacious premises. First, any widely accepted belief must necessarily be false. Second, stigmatized knowledge—what the Establishment spurns—must be true. The result is a large, self-referential network in which, for example, some UFO religionists promote anti-Jewish phobias while some antisemites practice Peruvian shamanism.|$|E
5|$|This <b>follows</b> <b>from</b> {{the fact}} that finding Hamiltonian cycles in maximal planar graphs is NP-complete. In a maximal planar graph, the book {{thickness}} is two {{if and only if}} a Hamiltonian cycle exists. Therefore, it is also NP-complete to test whether the book thickness of a given maximal planar graph is two.|$|E
5|$|A {{resolution}} to this apparent inconsistency {{is offered by}} inflationary theory in which a homogeneous and isotropic scalar energy field dominates the universe at some very early period (before baryogenesis). During inflation, the universe undergoes exponential expansion, and the particle horizon expands much more rapidly than previously assumed, so that regions presently {{on opposite sides of}} the observable universe are well inside each other's particle horizon. The observed isotropy of the CMB then <b>follows</b> <b>from</b> the fact that this larger region was in causal contact before the beginning of inflation.|$|E

5|$|Every {{vector space}} has a basis. This <b>follows</b> <b>from</b> Zorn's lemma, an {{equivalent}} {{formulation of the}} Axiom of Choice. Given the other axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory, the existence of bases {{is equivalent to the}} axiom of choice. The ultrafilter lemma, which is weaker than the axiom of choice, implies that all bases of a given vector space have the same number of elements, or cardinality (cf. Dimension theorem for vector spaces). It is called the dimension of the vector space, denoted by dim V. If the space is spanned by finitely many vectors, the above statements can be proven without such fundamental input from set theory.|$|E
5|$|If i < j, it <b>follows</b> <b>from</b> the {{definition}} that s'j ≡ 1 (mod s'i). Therefore, every two numbers in Sylvester's sequence are relatively prime. The sequence {{can be used}} to prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers, as any prime can divide at most one number in the sequence. More strongly, no prime factor of a number in the sequence can be congruent to 5 (mod 6), and the sequence {{can be used to}} prove that there are infinitely many primes congruent to 7 (mod 12).|$|E
5|$|The Demands of Liberal Education is a 1999 {{political}} philosophy book by Meira Levinson that establishes a liberal political theory of children's education that fits the mutual {{needs of the}} state and its diverse citizenry. She writes that the intent of a liberal education—an education that <b>follows</b> <b>from</b> a liberal society's values—is to maximize the autonomy of individual children through increasing their capacity for liberty. Levinson argues autonomy as a right to children. The book, published by Oxford University Press, aims to address a lacuna between educational policy and liberal political theory.|$|E

5|$|The French {{national}} stud, the Haras Nationaux, {{allows the}} registration of horses bred using artificial insemination and embryo transfer, {{but does not}} allow the registration of cloned horses. It considers the breed to be endangered, along with several other French draft breeds. A 2009 study of French equine genetics proposed that the Boulonnais, along with four other French breeds, should be a conservation priority, with a goal of maintaining maximum genetic variability in France's native horse population. This <b>follows</b> <b>from</b> studies done as early as 1983 that showed inbreeding {{and a lack of}} genetic diversity in the breed.|$|E
5|$|Yet it {{also seems}} to many that science will {{eventually}} have to explain such experiences. This <b>follows</b> <b>from</b> an assumption {{about the possibility of}} reductive explanations. According to this view, if an attempt can be successfully made to explain a phenomenon reductively (e.g., water), then it can be explained why the phenomenon has all of its properties (e.g., fluidity, transparency). In the case of mental states, this means {{that there needs to be}} an explanation of why they have the property of being experienced in a certain way.|$|E
5|$|An empty matrix is {{a matrix}} {{in which the}} number of rows or columns (or both) is zero. Empty {{matrices}} help dealing with maps involving the zero vector space. For example, if A is a 3-by-0 matrix and B is a 0-by-3 matrix, then AB is the 3-by-3 zero matrix corresponding to the null map from a 3-dimensional space V to itself, while BA is a 0-by-0 matrix. There is no common notation for empty matrices, but most computer algebra systems allow creating and computing with them. The determinant of the 0-by-0 matrix is 1 as <b>follows</b> <b>from</b> regarding the empty product occurring in the Leibniz formula for the determinant as 1. This value {{is also consistent with}} the fact that the identity map from any finite dimensional space to itself has determinant1, a fact that is often used as a part of the characterization of determinants.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the compatibility of the {{equations of motion}} which <b>follow</b> <b>from</b> d’Alembert’s principle {{in the case of}} a general autonomous non-holonomic mechanical system in N dimensions, with those equations which follow for the same system by assuming the validity of a specific variational action principle, in which the non-holonomic conditions are implemented by means of the multiplication rule in the calculus of variations. The equations of motion which <b>follow</b> <b>from</b> the principle of d’Alembert are not identical to the equations which <b>follow</b> <b>from</b> the variational action principle. We give a proof that the solutions to the equations of motion which <b>follow</b> <b>from</b> d’Alembert’s principle do not in general satisfy the equations which <b>follow</b> <b>from</b> the action principle with non-holonomic constraints. Thus the principle of d’Alembert and the minimal action principle involving the multiplication rule are not compatible in the case of systems with non-holonomic constraints. For simplicity the proof is given for autonomous systems only, with one general non-holonomic constraint, which is linear in the generalized velocities of the system...|$|R
