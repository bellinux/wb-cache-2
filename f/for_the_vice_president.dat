Claire eventually wins when Donald Blythe issues a bill to block any filibuster of coming onto the floor; while the house couldn't reach a majority. In the meantime, Claire is sworn in as Acting President of the United States and begins to exert her limited power by excluding Frank from certain presidential functions, such as the swearing-in of the new Justice of the Supreme Court.|$|E
5|$|On February 11, 2006, Dick Cheney shot Harry Whittington, a 78-year-old Texas attorney, while {{participating}} in a quail hunt at Armstrong ranch in Kenedy County, Texas. Secret Service agents and medical aides, who were traveling with Cheney, came to Whittington's assistance and treated his birdshot wounds to his right cheek, neck, and chest. An ambulance standing by <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> took Whittington to nearby Kingsville before he was flown by helicopter to Corpus Christi Memorial Hospital. On February 14, 2006, Whittington had a non-fatal heart attack and atrial fibrillation due {{to at least one}} lead-shot pellet lodged in or near his heart. Because of the small size of the birdshot pellets, doctors decided to leave up to 30 pieces of the pellets lodged in his body rather than try to remove them.|$|E

5|$|Agnew's pride {{had been}} stung by the {{negative}} {{news coverage of}} him during the campaign, and he sought to bolster his reputation by assiduous performance of his duties. It had become usual <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> to preside over the Senate only if he might be needed to break a tie, but Agnew opened every session {{for the first two}} months of his term, and spent more time presiding, in his first year, than any vice president since Alben Barkley, who held that role under Harry S. Truman. The first postwar vice president not to have been a senator, he took lessons in Senate procedures from the parliamentarian and from a Republican committee staffer. He lunched with small groups of senators, and was initially successful in building good relations. Although silenced on foreign policy matters, he attended White House staff meetings and spoke on urban affairs; when Nixon was present, he often presented the perspective of the governors. Agnew earned praise from the other members when he presided over a meeting of the White House Domestic Council in Nixon's absence but, like Nixon during Eisenhower's illnesses, did not sit in the president's chair. Nevertheless, many of the commission assignments Nixon gave Agnew were sinecures, with the vice president only formally the head.|$|E
5|$|He used a {{somewhat}} negative advertising campaign {{that seemed to}} have the intended initial effect of boosting him to serious contention. His 1988 campaign was based on the platform of supply-side economics and inner-city enterprise zones. In Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms: My Life in American Politics, campaign chairman Rollins described Kemp as a candidate with foibles. Kemp's campaign managers say he was unmanageable: he ignored timers on his speeches, refused to call contributors, and refused to practice for debates. A humbling Super Tuesday, in which his 39delegate total was fewer than eventual nominee and President Bush and both Dole and Pat Robertson, ended his campaign. After withdrawing from the race, he was still considered a contender <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> nomination. In 1989, the Kemps switched their official residence from Hamburg, New York to Bethesda, Maryland, their residence {{at the time of his}} death. In 1994, Kemp's 1988 campaign reached a settlement with the Federal Election Commission by agreeing to pay $120,000 in civil penalties for 1988 campaign election law violations for, among other things, excessive contributions, improper direct corporate donations, press overbilling, exceeding spending limits in Iowa and New Hampshire, and failure to reimburse corporations for providing air transportation.|$|E

She also helped to vet judicial nominees and worked as a speech writer <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President.</b>|$|E
500|$|Despite their {{personal}} differences, Truman and Barkley agreed on most issues. Because of Barkley's legislative experience, Truman insisted his vice-president attend cabinet meetings. Barkley chaired the Senate Democratic Policy Committee and attended Truman's weekly legislative conferences. When Congress created the National Security Council, it included {{the vice president}} as a member. Barkley acted as the administration's primary spokesperson, making 40 major speeches in his first eight months in office. Truman commissioned the United States Army Institute of Heraldry to create a seal and flag <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president,</b> advocated raising his salary, and increased his expense budget. Mark O. Hatfield's biographical sketch of Barkley noted that he was [...] "the last [...] to preside regularly over the Senate, the last not to have an office {{in or near the}} White House, [...] the last to identify more with the legislative than the executive branch".|$|E
500|$|Hobart {{was more}} {{assertive}} as Senate president than his predecessors had been. [...] It was customary <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> not {{to rule on}} disputed points, but to submit them to a vote. [...] Hobart, with {{his experience as a}} presiding officer in the New Jersey Legislature, took a more assertive role, ruling on disputes, and trying to expedite legislation. [...] Hobart was initially diffident in his role, feeling himself unproven beside longtime national legislators, but soon gained self-confidence, writing in a letter that [...] "I find that I am as good and as capable as any of them. [...] If they know a whole lot of things I don't know, I also know a whole lot of things they don't know. And there is a common humanity running through them all that makes us all as one, after all." [...] Hobart was so successful at guiding the administration's legislative agenda through the Senate that he became known as the [...] "assistant President".|$|E

500|$|At the Indiana primary, Humphrey {{began the}} {{strategy}} of using [...] "favorite son" [...] candidates as surrogates for his campaign, and to weaken his opponents. Governor Roger Branigin stood in for Humphrey in Indiana, and placed second, in front of McCarthy but below Kennedy. Senator Stephen M. Young of Ohio stood in <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> in Ohio, and won the primary. [...] He won his largest share of delegates during a six-week period after May 10, when the Vietnam War was briefly removed as a campaign issue due to the delicate peace talks with Hanoi. Later in May, he gained 57 delegates from Florida, as favorite son candidate Senator George Smathers defeated McCarthy in the Florida primary with 46% of the vote. Humphrey also picked up delegates from Pennsylvania, following an endorsement from Philadelphia Mayor James Hugh Joseph Tate, and collected delegates from leaders in New York, Minnesota, Montana, Utah, Delaware and Connecticut. The other candidates criticized this tactic, and accused Humphrey of organizing a [...] "bossed convention" [...] against {{the wishes of the}} people.|$|E
500|$|Nixon {{established}} transition {{headquarters in}} New York, but Agnew was {{not invited to}} meet with him there until November 27, when the two met for an hour. When Agnew spoke to reporters afterwards, he stated that he felt [...] "exhilarated" [...] with his new responsibilities, but did not explain what those were. During the transition period, Agnew traveled extensively, enjoying his new status. He vacationed on St. Croix, where he played a round of golf with Humphrey and Muskie. He went to Memphis for the 1968 Liberty Bowl, and to New York to attend the wedding of Nixon's daughter Julie to David Eisenhower. Agnew was a fan of the Baltimore Colts; in January, he was the guest of team owner Carroll Rosenbloom at Super Bowl III, and watched Joe Namath and the New York Jets upset the Colts, 16–7. There was as yet no official residence <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president,</b> and Spiro and Judy Agnew secured a suite at the Sheraton Hotel in Washington formerly occupied by Johnson while vice president. Only one of their children, Kim, the youngest daughter, moved there with them, the others remaining in Maryland.|$|E
500|$|Fillmore {{had spent}} the four months between the {{election}} and swearing-in being feted by the New York Whigs and winding up affairs in the comptroller's office. Taylor had written promising influence in the new administration, but the president-elect mistakenly thought {{that the vice president}} was a cabinet member, which was not true in the 19th century. Fillmore, Seward and Weed had met and come to general agreement on how to divide federal jobs in New York. Seward, once he went to Washington, made friendly contact with Taylor's cabinet nominees, advisers, and the general's brother, and an alliance between the incoming administration and the Weed machine was soon under way behind Fillmore's back. [...] In exchange for support, Seward and Weed were allowed to designate who would fill federal jobs in New York, with Fillmore given far less than had been agreed. When Fillmore, after the inauguration, discovered this, he went to Taylor, but the only result was that the warfare against Fillmore's influence became open. Fillmore supporters like Collier, who had nominated him at the convention, were passed over for candidates backed by Weed, who was triumphant even in Buffalo. This greatly increased the influence of Weed in New York politics, and diminished Fillmore's. According to Rayback, [...] "by mid-1849, Fillmore's situation had become desperate." [...] Despite his lack of influence, he was pestered by office seekers and those seeking to lease or sell a house to him, as there was then no official residence <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president.</b> [...] He enjoyed one aspect of his office, due to his lifelong love of learning: he became deeply involved in the administration of the Smithsonian Institution as a member ex officio of its Board of Regents.|$|E
50|$|The United States Constitution designates <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> of <b>the</b> United States {{to serve}} as {{president}} of the Senate and to cast the tie-breaking vote {{in the case of a}} deadlock. To carry out these duties, <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> has long had an office in the Capitol Building, just outside the Senate chamber. Due to lack of space in the Capitol’s old Senate wing, early <b>vice</b> <b>presidents</b> often shared their room with the president. Following the 1850s extension of the building, the Senate formally set aside a room <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president’s</b> exclusive use.|$|R

2500|$|Since World War II, the President of the United States has had sole {{authority}} to launch U.S. nuclear weapons, whether {{as a first}} strike or nuclear retaliation. This arrangement was seen as necessary during the Cold War to present a credible nuclear deterrent; if an attack was detected, the United States would have only minutes to launch a counterstrike before its nuclear capability was severely damaged, or national leaders killed. [...] If the President has been killed, command authority follows the presidential line of succession. Changes to this policy have been proposed, but currently {{the only way to}} countermand such an order before the strike was launched would be <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> and the majority of the Cabinet to relieve the President under Section 4 of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution.|$|E
2500|$|Johnson {{was touched}} by a Senate scandal in August 1963 when Bobby Baker, the Secretary to the Majority Leader of the Senate and a protégé of Johnson's, came under {{investigation}} by the Senate Rules Committee for allegations of bribery and financial malfeasance. One witness alleged that Baker had arranged for the witness to give kickbacks <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President.</b> Baker resigned in October, and the investigation did not expand to Johnson. The negative publicity from the affair fed rumors in Washington circles that Kennedy was planning on dropping Johnson from the Democratic ticket in the upcoming 1964 presidential election. However, on October 31, 1963, a reporter asked if he intended and expected to have Johnson on the ticket the following year. Kennedy replied, [...] "Yes to both those questions." [...] There is little doubt that Robert Kennedy and Johnson hated each other, yet John and Robert Kennedy agreed that dropping Johnson from the ticket could produce heavy losses in the South in the 1964 election, and they agreed that Johnson would stay on the ticket.|$|E
2500|$|The {{documented}} history {{begins in}} 1850, when a seal was made after a crude drawing submitted by President Fillmore. [...] It depicted an eagle [...] "displayed with wings inverted", i.e. with its wingtips down, holding an olive branch and three arrows in its talons. [...] The shield {{is essentially the}} same as the Great Seal, with a blue chief and red and white stripes and the eagle facing to its right, though there were nineteen stripes and the outermost stripes were red, both unlike the Great Seal. Thirty-one stars were distributed above and around the eagle, indicating that the seal dates from after when California became the 31st state in September 1850. [...] It was made by Edward Stabler, a farmer and postmaster in Sandy Spring, Maryland, who had earlier made seals for the Senate, House of Representatives, and several government departments. [...] Stabler had also made a seal <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Vice</b> <b>President</b> in 1846, and the correspondence surrounding it indicated that even earlier vice presidential seals existed, so presumably earlier presidential seals existed as well. The president's seal was described by Benson Lossing in 1856 as [...] "round, with an eagle upon it" [...] (contrasting it to the seal used during the Continental Congress).|$|E
50|$|Reason <b>for</b> loss: <b>The</b> <b>vice</b> <b>president</b> {{felt that}} Arrow did not promote the GNC brand well {{and that they}} {{presented}} a difficult boxing story to follow.|$|R
