Farmland was intensely cultivated, and small businesses and industries sprang up around the intersection of Bellefontaine, Parker, and Spanish Pond roads, forming the village’s center. The Catholic parish of St. Aloysius in Spanish Lake was founded by, and for many years served as, a mission of Baden, located in the northern portion of St. Louis. The Bank of Baden played a large role in <b>farm</b> <b>financing</b> in Spanish Lake, and many county farmers also had business interests in Baden.

The {{purpose of this}} case study design was to explore the methods that some small-scale maize and cassava farmers in Amankwakrom Subdistrict used in obtaining <b>farm</b> <b>financing.</b> Two themes from the literature review were a lack of collateral for small-scale <b>farm</b> <b>financing</b> and the small-scale farmers cooperative associations 2 ̆ 7 role in <b>farm</b> <b>financing.</b> Regional-scale management sustainability index formed the conceptual framework for this study. Data collection included semistructured face-to-face interviews with 8 fluent English speaking small-scale maize and cassava farmers who have obtained <b>farm</b> <b>financing</b> in the previous years. Using the Microsoft Excel and Non-numerical unstructured data indexing and theorizing software program for data analysis method, 3 major themes emerged: the farmer 2 ̆ 7 s membership benefits of working in cooperative associations; farmer 2 ̆ 7 s ability to provide the collateral requirements for the financial institutions; and farmer 2 ̆ 7 s good loan repayment history. The study findings indicated that some small-scale maize and cassava farmers obtained farm loans because they used the cooperative associations as their collateral assets {{in order to satisfy}} for the requirements of the financial institutions. Social implications include the potential to guide the small-scale maize and cassava farmers to access farm credits to use in expanding their farm sizes. Expansion in farm sizes may result in more maize and cassava production that can help eliminate hunger and reduce poverty in the Amankwakrom Subdistrict of Ghana...|$|E

40|$|<b>Farm</b> <b>financing</b> {{is one of}} {{the factors}} facilitating the {{development}} of agriculture which allow farmers to expand the scale of farming and adopt new technologies. Unfortunately, a number of financial institutions often perceive farmers as "unbankable poor" that is costly to finance. KJKS BMT is one financial institution that is initiated by the government of West Sumatra's mission of poverty reduction in rural areas in particular to improve the access of small farmers to credit. So this study aims to identify and analyze the existence and accessibility of financing KJKS BMT in serving the financing of farming in West Sumatra. This study was conducted in a multi-stage random sampling, cities that randomly selected are Kota Padang and Bukittinggi, and then for each city, one KJKS BMT is also randomly selected. Primary data were collected by interviewing 60 respondent’s farmers. This research uses grounded research methods and data analysis in qualitative descriptive. Period of observation data for 2 years ie 2012 - 2014. Existence of KJKS BMT to finance farming measured by used five indicator namely a) The number of customers, b) The number of farmer customers, c) credit share for the agricultural, d) The number of <b>farm</b> <b>financing</b> and e) Development of BMT’s human resources. Furthermore accessibility is measured using six indicators, namely: (a) access to information, (b) access to loan procedure, (c) access to the maximum limit, (d) access to the time of disbursement, (e) access to loan repayment, and (f) facilitation of access to financing. The results show that (1) although the existence of KJKS BMT start respected by rural communities, and even show a positive growth, but the credit share given by KJKS BMT to farm credit is still very small compared to another sectors (like trade and manufactures) which are less than 5 %, Even though the level of customer growth of farmers {{during the past two years}} is reach 75 %, higher than the growth of total customer (2) Accessibility of KJKS BMT to <b>farm</b> <b>financing</b> overall is good, although there are several factor that must be addressed like the availability of information, the number of loan, monitoring and loan supervision. </em...|$|E

40|$|Although India {{possesses}} the {{large volume of}} livestock, their productivity is abysmally low at global level. India, with its wide variation in geo-ecological parameters, elucidates a high variation in the productivity of its livestock, among regions. The compound growth rate of livestock productivity was worked out for the Southern Peninsular state of India, Tamil Nadu. The average productivity of milk in cross bred cows and buffaloes in Tamil Nadu was less than the national average, while the productivity desi cows was a bit a more. The annual compound growth rate of milk productivity among crossbred cows of Tamil Nadu was at meager 0. 54 per cent during the period between 1998 - 1999 and 2006 - 2007, whereas the productivity of milk in desi cows had improved from at an annual compound growth rate of 1. 29 per cent. Notably, the milk productivity in buffaloes had declined {{at a rate of}} 0. 29 per cent during the period under study. The annual compound growth of egg productivity in improved hens of Tamil Nadu was 20. 87 per cent. The average annual productivity was 109. 531 eggs, which improved from 70. 623 in 1998 - 1999 to 197. 084 in 2004 - 2005. Correspondingly, the productivity of desi hens also had a positive swing from the year 2003 - 2004 onwards. The results implied that the simulation of increased productivity, better <b>farm</b> <b>financing</b> and improved milk marketing could result in enhanced livestock production that would meet the future demands.
