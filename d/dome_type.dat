25|$|The muqarnas <b>dome</b> <b>type</b> {{may have}} {{originated}} in Abbasid Iraq as single brick shells of large squinch-like cells, {{but it was}} popular in North Africa and Spain with more intricate cell patterns in stucco on a wooden inner shell. Two outstanding examples from the Moorish palace of the Alhambra in Granada, Spain, are the 14th century Hall of the Abencerrajes and Hall of the two Sisters. In 14th century Egypt, the Mamluks began building stone domes, rather than brick, for the tombs of sultans and emirs and would construct hundreds of them {{over the next two}} and a half centuries. Externally, their supporting structures are distinguished by chamfered or stepped angles and round windows in a triangular arrangement. A variety of shapes for the dome itself were used, including bulbous, ogee, and keel-shaped, and included carved patterns in spirals, zigzags, and floral designs. Bulbous minarets from Egypt spread to Syria in the 15th century and would influence the use of bulbous domes in the architecture of northwest Europe, having become associated with the Holy Land by pilgrims. In the Low Countries of northwest Europe, multi-story spires with truncated bulbous cupolas supporting smaller cupolas or crowns became popular in the sixteenth century.|$|E

2500|$|The early domes of the Middle Ages, {{particularly}} {{in those areas}} recently under Byzantine control, were an extension of earlier Roman architecture. The domed church architecture of Italy from the sixth to the eighth centuries followed that of the Byzantine provinces and, although this influence diminishes under Charlemagne, it continued on in Venice, Southern Italy, and Sicily. Charlemagne's Palatine Chapel is a notable exception, being influenced by Byzantine models from Ravenna and Constantinople. The Dome of the Rock, an Umayyad Muslim religious shrine built in Jerusalem, was designed similarly to nearby Byzantine martyria and Christian churches. Domes were also built as part of Muslim palaces, throne halls, pavilions, and baths, and blended elements of both Byzantine and Persian architecture, using both pendentives and squinches. The origin of the crossed-arch <b>dome</b> <b>type</b> is debated, but the earliest known example is from the tenth century at the Great Mosque of Córdoba. In Egypt, a [...] "keel" [...] shaped dome profile was characteristic of Fatimid architecture. The use of squinches became widespread in the Islamic world by the tenth and eleventh centuries. Bulbous domes were used to cover large buildings in Syria after the eleventh century, following an architectural revival there, and the present shape of the Dome of the Rock's dome likely dates from this time.|$|E

The Renaissance architectural style spread from Italy in the Early modern period.

50|$|Mid-range {{drivers are}} usually cone types or, less commonly, <b>dome</b> <b>types,</b> or {{compression}} horn drivers. The radiating diaphragm of a cone mid-range unit is a truncated cone, {{with a voice}} coil attached at the neck, along with the spider portion of the suspension, and with the cone surround at the wide end. Cone mid-range drivers typically resemble small woofers. The most common material used for mid-range cones is paper, occasionally impregnated and/or surface-treated with polymers or resins {{in order to improve}} vibrational damping. Other mid-range cone materials include plastics such as polypropylene, Cobex, Bextrene, woven Kevlar, fiberglass, carbon fiber, or light metal alloys based on aluminium, magnesium, titanium, or other alloys. The radiating surface of a dome mid-range is typically a 90-degree section of a sphere, made from cloth, metal, or plastic film, with its suspension and voice coil co-located at {{the outer edge of the}} dome. Most professional concert mid-range drivers are compression drivers coupled to horns. A very few mid-ranges are electrostatic drivers, planar magnetic drivers, or ribbon drivers.|$|R

They led socially nurtured life even while living in the cave.Eventually they came out from the cave. There they come across one unnatural beast. Many people were eaten and post great danger to their survival. So the village council (leipak upa:-Khulpu-Khullak, Keishang and Khangshillak) decided to kill the said demon like giant beast. With concerted effort they could finally killed the beast which they called SOVI -YA.|$|E

5000|$|Earthquakes in August 553 and on 14 December 557 caused {{cracks in}} the main dome and eastern half-dome. The main dome {{collapsed}} completely during a subsequent earthquake on 7 May 558, destroying the ambon, altar, and ciborium. The collapse was due mainly to the unfeasibly high bearing load and to the enormous shear load of the dome, which was too flat. These caused the deformation of the piers which sustained the dome. The emperor ordered an immediate restoration. He entrusted it to Isidorus the Younger, nephew of Isidore of Miletus, who used lighter materials and elevated the dome by [...] "30 feet" [...] (about 6.25 m) - giving the building its current interior height of 55.6 m. Moreover, Isidorus changed the <b>dome</b> <b>type,</b> erecting a ribbed dome with pendentives, whose diameter lay between 32.7 and 33.5 m. Under Justinian's orders, eight Corinthian columns were disassembled from Baalbek, Lebanon, and shipped to Constantinople around 560. This reconstruction, giving the church its present 6th-century form, was completed in 562. The Byzantine poet Paul the Silentiary composed a long epic poem (still extant), known as Ekphrasis, for the rededication of the basilica presided over by Patriarch Eutychius on 23 December 562.|$|E

50|$|The {{golden-shouldered parrot}} {{will build a}} nest in the taller {{magnetic}} termite mounds (up to 2 m high)but surveys point to the preference for the lower <b>dome</b> <b>type</b> mounds. This may be {{to do with the}} slower heating up and cooling of the smaller denser mounds.Commonly they dig a burrow into the mound when wet season rains have softened the substrate of the mounds. Typically a 50 -350 mm long tunnel is dug down into the mound ending in the nesting chamber. The clutch size is between 3-6 eggs, which are incubated for 20 days. The termite occupants of the mound use a natural form of airconditioning to preserve the climatic conditions of their colony and this process regulates the temperature of the parrot's nest chamber at around 28-30 degrees C. Temperature surveys have shown however, a range of 13-35 degrees C. These conditions have led to the parrots developing a habit of leaving the eggs at night beginning around the 10th day after hatching. A symbiotic relationship is present between the Golden shouldered parrot and a moth species (Trisyntopa scatophaga) that is worthy of note. Found in around half of parrot nests, the moths seek out the newly dug nest tunnels and deposit their eggs in the entrance. The hatching moth larvae consume the faeces of the nestling parrots therefore helping to keep the nest chamber clean. Whether the parrots receive any other benefits from the presence of moths is arguable as not all nests contain moth larvae.|$|E
50|$|The AnyKey uses rubber <b>dome</b> <b>type</b> key{{switches}}, {{with all}} the switches and contact points on a single sheet. The keyswitch layer contacts a single flexible membrane that detects all keypresses and directs them to the controller board via a pair of flexible edge connectors. While the AnyKey is branded as a Gateway product, the membrane layer clearly bears the inscription “Maxi Switch Inc,” revealing the true maker of the hardware. This membrane is backed by a metal plate approximately a sixteenth of an inch thick which serves to hold the membrane rigid and in place as well as giving the keyboard considerable heft. Held in place {{on top of the}} rubber dome layer is a plastic block that holds the key pillars which in turn hold the keycaps themselves. The key pillars are individually replaceable but cannot be removed without dismantling the keyboard to separate the rubber dome layer from the plastic support layer and the removal of the latter from the assembly. The key caps are held onto the pillars via friction with cross shaped pegs. The key caps are easily removed for cleaning or rearrangement, as all keys on the keyboard use the same attachment method and, {{with the exception of the}} Space Bar, Enter, Shift, Tab, Control, Alt, and Caps Lock keys, they are all the same size. In this manner, keys that have been remapped (like the commonly remapped arrow keys) can also be physically moved to the correct location on the board. Physical relocation of keytops should be done with caution as the slope of the keytops is raked into three pairs of rows, e.g. if the Z key is swapped with the F1 key, both keys will have different rake to those surrounding them.|$|E
