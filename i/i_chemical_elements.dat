40|$|Science and Heritage project Scientific {{analyses}} {{can become}} powerful tools for heritage professionals, when properly proposed and suitably conducted; which means using the appropriate method, within correct {{timing of the}} project. This necessitates not only appropriate and clear questions according to {{the objectives of the}} research and the conservation needs, but also a prior deep understanding of the site and its relation to different external parameters. Following the anamnesis of the building we propose a checklist of distinctive questions the team of heritage professionals need to discuss and clarify with the scientists, {{in order to get the}} most out of their analysis: What do I wish to clarify? (Date? Technology? Morphology? Composition? Alteration?) How accurate responses do I need? How much time does the analysis require? When the results will arrive in the timeline of the project? Is it expensive? Can the project afford it? Can it be conducted in situ? Is destructive or non-destructive? Does it require sampling? How many samples are necessary for an accurate response? What kind of answers do <b>I</b> get? (<b>Chemical</b> <b>elements?</b> Graphics? Absolute or Relative dates?) Lucía Gómez-Robles & Laura-Melpomeni Tapin...|$|R
40|$|Ecologists {{have long}} {{recognized}} that species are {{sustained by the}} flux, storage and turnover of two biological currencies: energy, which fuels biological metabolism and materials (<b>i.</b> e. <b>chemical</b> <b>elements),</b> which are used to construct biomass. Ecological theories often describe the dynamics of populations, communities and ecosystems in terms of either energy (e. g. population-dynamics theory) or materials (e. g. resource-competition theory). These two classes of theory have been formulated using different assumptions, and yield distinct, but often complementary predictions for the same or similar phenomena. For example, the energy-based equation of von Bertalanffy and the nutrient-based equation of Droop both describe growth. Yet, there is relatively little theoretical understanding of how these two distinct classes of theory, and the currencies they use, are interrelated. Here, we begin {{to address this issue}} by integrating models and concepts from two rapidly developing theories, the metabolic theory of ecology and ecological stoichiometry theory. We show how combining these theories, using recently published theory and data along with new theoretical formulations, leads to novel predictions on the flux, storage and turnover of energy and materials that apply to animals, plants and unicells. The theory and results presented here highlight the potential for developing a more general ecological theory that explicitly relates the energetics and stoichiometry of individuals, communities and ecosystems to subcellular structures and processes. We conclude by discussing the basic and applied implications of such a theory, and the prospects and challenges for further development. 16 page(s...|$|R
