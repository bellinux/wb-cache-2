40|$|Abstract: This paper formulates a {{theoretical}} model {{to investigate the}} determi-nants of the rate of innovation across economies that differ in important ways in industrial structure and face the possibility of asymmetric knowledge spillovers between industries. In particular, I wish to extend the model of expanding product variety in order to study the implications of a highly diver-sified sectoral composition across regional industrial bases on rates of economic innovation. A global knowledge spillover has long been recognized as a possi-ble explanation {{for the absence of}} scale effects. What has not been appreciated is the unstable nature of the equilibrium associated with this explanation. The model can, therefore, be used to understand how, in a dynamic setting, certain regions, such as Silicon Valley or the high-tech corridor stretching along Route 28 from northern Massachusetts into southern New Hampshire, become cen-ters of innovative activity while other regions ' industries fade in importance. These results suggest a strong role <b>for</b> <b>regional</b> <b>economics</b> in interpreting the results of new growth theory. I...|$|E
40|$|The {{notion of}} {{face-to-face}} contacts has recently become {{very popular in}} regional economics and in economic geography. This is the most obvious way to explain why firms still locate in proximity to others after the "death of distance", i. e., the shrinking costs for transportation, especially transportation of messages' pure information content. While this is intuitive, controlled laboratory experiments provide much more direct and reliable evidence {{on the importance of}} face-to-face contacts. They tackle the question what personal contacts are good for, and in which cases their effects are negligible. To the best of my knowledge, regional economists and geographers are not aware of this new and developing string of literature; it is {{the purpose of this paper}} to survey and to organize the relevant experimental research with a special focus on its importance <b>for</b> <b>regional</b> <b>economics.</b> However, the paper might also serve to alert more experimentalists to the importance of their work for current regional science, of which they seem not to be aware either.

40|$|No {{two ways}} about it: the soccer World Cup {{competition}} in June 2006 in Germany {{was a great}} experience, {{not only for the}} soccer fans, and it still resonates far and wide. The various commentaries have all concluded that the economic effects were positive. Emphasis has often been placed on increased turnover in the retail trade, overnight accommodation, receipts from tourism and effects on employment. The present study shows that this reasoning is mostly of little value and may even be incorrect.

40|$|While the {{productivity}} gains {{associated with the}} geographic concentration of industry (i. e. localization) are by now well-documented, little work has considered how those gains are distributed across individual workers. This paper offers evidence on the connection between total employment and the relative wage earnings of high- and low-skill workers (i. e. inequality) within two-digit manufacturing industries across the states {{and a collection of}} metropolitan areas in the U. S. between 1970 and 1990. Using two different measures - 90 - 10 percentile gaps in both overall and residual wages - I find that wage dispersion falls substantially as industry employment expands. Results from a simple decomposition of this relationship into average plant-size and plant-count components indicate overwhelmingly that average plant size is the primary driving mechanism. Although not necessarily inconsistent with theories appealing to intermediate inputs or technological spillovers, such findings are particularly supportive of Marshall's (1920) labor market pooling explanation <b>for</b> localization.

The company chose to commission more than one study to avoid the danger of the merits of the project being seen as overly reliant upon one economic model and hence one particular set of assumptions. While there were differences between their results, both studies reported major net benefits to the New South Wales economy, and the NIEIR research was also able to identify additional and substantial benefits to the national economy.

40|$|This journal {{has been}} {{launched}} in 1972 {{under the title}} <b>Regional</b> and Urban <b>Economics,</b> which is almost {{the name of the}} JEL-classification entry R. The first point we wish to make is that, by the time this journal was launched, urban economics was already a well-established field drawing on new concepts and tools. By contrast, the scientific status of <b>regional</b> <b>economics</b> was less clear in that regional concepts, models and techniques were too often a mere extension of those used at the national level, with an additional index identifying the different regions (see, e. g., interregional input-output matrices or the Harrod-Domar model of regional growth). 1 The Samuelsonian emphasis put on trade theory also acted as an impediment to the further development of <b>regional</b> <b>economics,</b> the trade of goods being viewed as a substitute to the mobility of factors. Today, thanks to the surge of new economic geography (in short, NEG), it is time to re-think <b>regional</b> <b>economics.</b> This is what we wish to do in this note.
