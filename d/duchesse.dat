5|$|Rilke {{stayed with}} Rodin in 1905 and 1906, and did {{administrative}} work for him; {{he would later}} write a laudatory monograph on the sculptor. Rodin and Beuret's modest country estate in Meudon, purchased in 1897, was a host to such visitors as King Edward, dancer Isadora Duncan, and harpsichordist Wanda Landowska. Rodin moved to the city in 1908, renting the main floor of the Hôtel Biron, an 18th-century townhouse. He left Beuret in Meudon, and began an affair with the American-born <b>Duchesse</b> de Choiseul. From 1910, he mentored the Russian sculptor, Moissey Kogan.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} {{to establish a}} bridge in Cubzac is taken by Napoleon Bonaparte on 30 January 1812 and February 3, 1813. The bridge was originally {{to be completed in}} 1820. However, Cubzac's first bridge was a suspension bridge for which construction works started in 1834, under Louis-Philippe I. Works lasted four years, and public inauguration occurred on August 17, 1839 by the Duc and <b>Duchesse</b> of Orleans. The bridge had cost an estimated 3 million gold francs, was 545m long and had 5 bays. Shortly after its construction, the pillars sank about one metre. During its 30 years of existence, it withstood storms despite the large amplitude oscillations caused. However, on March 2, 1869 a large storm, causing oscillations of more than two metres, partially destroyed the bridge and rendered it useless. Ancient methods to cross the Dordogne where reinstated. At first, barges and steamboats were used. Then, starting from October 1870, a large steam tub was used, measuring 21m by 13m. To cover the expensive construction costs, a toll was levied for the first 27 years.|$|E

6000|$|Then as Crystal {{once more}} relapsed into silence and two hot tears {{dropped on the}} <b>Duchesse's</b> {{wrinkled}} hands, the old woman added softly: ...|$|R
60|$|But already Crystal {{had torn}} her hands out of Mme. la <b>Duchesse's</b> grasp {{and now was}} {{struggling}} to free herself from Jeanne's terrified and clinging embrace.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see," [...] rejoined Clyffurde, ostentatiously smothering a yawn, [...] "what M. le préfet's {{visit to}} Brestalou {{had to do}} with the <b>Duchesse's</b> journey to the north. You have got intrigues on the brain, my good de Marmont." ...|$|R
25|$|During her lifetime, Louise Élisabeth {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for scandal. In an irony of history, the next <b>duchesse</b> de Berry, Princess Caroline Ferdinande of Naples and Sicily, was also known for her scandalous behaviour.|$|E
25|$|During the Bourbon Restoration, Tourzel {{was made}} a duchess by a {{grateful}} King Charles X. She later published her memoirs, which are an invaluable historical account of {{the final days of}} the royal household. Her daughter, Pauline, became a lady-in-waiting to Marie Antoinette's only surviving child, Marie-Thérèse-Charlotte, <b>Duchesse</b> d'Angoulême.|$|E
25|$|Sucking Shrimp by Stephanie Theobald has Fanny Cradock {{as one of}} {{its central}} characters. To provincial Cornish heroine Rosa Barge, Cradock {{represents}} glamour, sophistication and the life she aspires to in her concoctions of a Taj Mahal out of Italian meringue and <b>duchesse</b> potato dyed vivid green.|$|E
60|$|Once {{more that}} sudden wave of colour swept over Hector's solemn old face. He was evidently {{at a loss}} how to take Mme. la <b>Duchesse's</b> remark--whether as a rebuke or merely {{as one of those}} mild jokes of which every one knew that Madame was inordinately fond.|$|R
60|$|The little couple did not fall; {{they were}} struck on to a {{neighbouring}} bench, luckily: {{but there was}} a laugh at the expense of Stenio and the Queen of Scots--and Lord Kew, settling his panting partner on to a seat, came up to make excuses for his awkwardness to the lady who had been its victim. At the laugh produced by the catastrophe, the <b>Duchesse's</b> eyes gleamed with anger.|$|R
60|$|Something of {{his dignity}} of {{attitude}} seemed to fall {{away from him}} as he vainly tried to solve this portentous problem. His mouth felt dry and his head hot, {{and he did not}} know on which foot he could stand with the least possible discomfort, and how he could contrive to hide from Madame la <b>Duchesse's</b> piercing eyes that very obvious patch in the right knee of his breeches.|$|R
25|$|In 1956, Paul Henri Spaak led the Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom at the Val <b>Duchesse</b> conference centre, which {{prepared}} for the Treaty of Rome in 1957. The conference led to the signature, on 25 March 1957, of the Treaty of Rome establishing a European Economic Community.|$|E
25|$|La Vallière's Réflexions sur la miséricorde de Dieu, written {{after her}} retreat, were printed by Lequeux in 1767, and in 1860 Réflexions, lettres et sermons, by M. P. Clement (2 vols.). Some {{apocryphal}} Mémoires appeared in 1829, and the Lettres de Mme la <b>Duchesse</b> de la Vallière (1767) are a corrupt {{version of her}} correspondence with the Maréchal de Bellefonds.|$|E
25|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the revolution of 1848 he held the Tuileries long enough to cover the king's retreat, but refrained from initiating active measures against the mob. He followed his sister-in-law, Hélène, <b>duchesse</b> d'Orléans, and her two sons to the chamber of deputies, but was separated from them by the rioters, and only escaped finally by disguising himself in the uniform of a national guard.|$|E
6000|$|... "It can't be very {{difficult}} to be kind to such an attractive young man," [...] was Mme. la <b>Duchesse's</b> dry comment. [...] "Recommendation or no recommendation I liked your Mr. Clyffurde and if it were not so late in the day and there was still time to give my opinion, I should suggest that Mr. Clyffurde's money could quite well regild our family 'scutcheon. He is very rich too, I understand." ...|$|R
6000|$|The biographer of the Newcomes has no need (although he {{possesses}} the fullest information) to touch upon the <b>Duchesse's</b> doings, further than {{as they relate}} to that most respectable English family. When the Duke took his wife into the country, Florac never hesitated to say that to live with her was dangerous for the old man, and to cry out to his friends of the Boulevards or the Jockey Club, [...] "Ma parole d'honneur, cette femme le tuera!" ...|$|R
60|$|Suddenly the {{cumbrous}} vehicle gave {{a terrific}} lurch, which sent the unsuspecting Jeanne flying into Mme. la <b>Duchesse's</b> lap and threw Crystal with equal violence against her father's knees. There was much cracking of whips, loud calls and louder oaths from coachman and postillions, much creaking and groaning of wheels, another lurch--more feeble this time--more groaning, more creaking, more oaths {{and finally the}} coach with a final quivering as it were of all its parts settled down to an ominous standstill.|$|R

25|$|Francis II {{worked to}} seek a husband for Anne who would {{be strong enough to}} defend Brittany from further {{influence}} from the French Crown. <b>Duchesse</b> Anne of Brittany was initially betrothed to Edward, Prince of Wales, the son of Edward IV of England, but upon the king's death his son disappeared and the English throne passed to Richard III of England. Anne was then married to Maximillian I of Austria.|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1774, Marie Antoinette began to befriend {{some of her}} male admirers, such as the baron de Besenval, the duc de Coigny, and Count Valentin Esterházy, and formed deep friendships with various ladies at court. Most noted was Marie-Louise, princesse de Lamballe, related to the royal family through her {{marriage}} into the Penthièvre family. On 19 September 1774 she appointed her superintendent of her household, an appointment she soon transferred to her new favourite, the <b>duchesse</b> de Polignac.|$|E
50|$|Marie Antoinette {{acquired}} the hairstyle {{which was a}} creation from the famed hairdresser of the day Léonard Autié. In April 1774, it was first sported as Le Pouf Sentimental by Duchess de Chartres at the Opera. The <b>Duchesse's</b> hairstyle was immense. 14 yards of gauze were wrapped around a tower {{as well as two}} figures representing the baby Duc de Beaujolais in his nurse's arms with an African boy (a particular favourite of the Duchess) at her feet. A parrot and a plate of cherries were also added.|$|R
6000|$|No doubt M. le Comte de Cambray {{expected}} {{that at this}} awful announcement, Mme. la <b>Duchesse's</b> indignation and anger would know no bounds. He was quite ready even now {{with a string of}} apologies which he would formulate directly she allowed him to speak. He certainly felt very guilty towards her for the undesirable acquaintance which she had made in her brother's own house. Great was his surprise therefore when Madame's wrinkled face wreathed itself into a huge smile, which presently broadened into a merry laugh, as she threw back her head, and said still laughing: ...|$|R
60|$|When, {{after half}} an hour of this wearying cross-examination, Madame at last granted him a respite, he made a pretext of urgent {{business}} at M. le Comte d'Artois' headquarters and took his leave of the ladies. He waited in vain hope that the <b>Duchesse's</b> tact would induce her to leave him alone for a moment with Crystal. Madame stuck obstinately to her chair and was blind and deaf to every hint of appeal from him, whilst Crystal, who was singularly absorbed and had lent but a very indifferent ear to his narrative, made no attempt to detain him.|$|R
25|$|The Marquis de Sade and Charles Baudelaire were baptized in Saint-Sulpice (1740 and 1821, respectively), and {{the church}} also saw the {{marriage}} of Victor Hugo to Adèle Foucher (1822). Louise Élisabeth de Bourbon and Louise Élisabeth d'Orléans, grand daughters of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan are buried in the church. Louise de Lorraine, <b>duchesse</b> de Bouillon was buried here in 1788, wife of Charles Godefroy de La Tour d'Auvergne. Jules Massenet set an act of his opera Manon here.|$|E
25|$|In 1789, {{after the}} fall of the Bastille, many members of the Queen's {{intimate}} circle were forced to flee abroad. The <b>Duchesse</b> de Polignac, the queen's favourite and the governess to the royal children, was forced to emigrate to Switzerland. Marie Antoinette appointed Louise Élisabeth to the newly vacant post, with particular attention to be paid to the Dauphin, Louis-Charles. The Marquise was advised to curb the Dauphin's fear of loud noises, particularly the barking of the many dogs at Versailles.|$|E
25|$|In 1697, the 12-year-old Marie-Adélaïde de Savoie married Louis XIV's grandson, Louis, duc de Bourgogne. The duchesse's vivacity and precociousness quickly won {{the heart}} of the aging king, who {{presented}} the Ménagerie to the <b>duchesse.</b> Between 1698 and 1700 the interior was redecorated. In a stylistic departure from the aesthetic of Louis XIV's fourth building campaign in the chateau, which was characterized by courtly austerity, the new décor of the Ménagerie was characterized by a youthful exuberance that anticipated the Rococo style of Louis XV.|$|E
60|$|I like {{to think}} of her just as she was on that memorable day early in March of the year 1815--just as she sat that morning on a low stool close to Mme. la <b>Duchesse's</b> high-backed chair, and with her eyes fixed so enquiringly upon Madame's kind old face. Her fair hair was done up in the quaint loops and curls which characterised the mode of the moment: she had on a white dress cut low at the neck and had wrapped a soft {{cashmere}} shawl round her shoulders, for the weather was cold and there was no fire in the stately open hearth.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{think that}} they can deceive me," [...] de Marmont was saying airily. [...] "They think that I am as great a fool as they are, with their talk of Mme. la <b>Duchesse's</b> journey north, {{directly}} after the wedding! Bah! any dolt can put two and two together: the Comte tells me in one breath that he had a visit from Fourier in the afternoon, and that the Duchesse--who only arrived in Brestalou yesterday--would leave again for Paris on the day after to-morrow, and he tells it me with a mysterious air, and adds a knowing wink, and a promise that he would explain himself more fully later on. I could have laughed--if it were not all so miserably stupid." ...|$|R
60|$|Lord Kew, however, {{had been}} seen walking with her in public, and {{particularly}} attentive to her during her brief appearance in the ballroom; and the old Dowager, who regularly attended all places of amusement, and was at twenty parties and six dinners the week before she died, thought fit to be particularly gracious to Madame d'Ivry upon this evening, and, far from shunning the <b>Duchesse's</b> presence or being rude to her, as on former occasions, was entirely smiling and good-humoured. Lady Kew, too, thought {{there had been a}} reconciliation between Ethel and her cousin. Lady Anne had given her mother some account of the handshaking. Kew's walk with Ethel, the quadrille which she had danced with him alone, induced the elder lady to believe that matters had been made up between the young people.|$|R
25|$|Cellini {{then worked}} at the court of Francis I at Fontainebleau and Paris. However, he {{considered}} the <b>duchesse</b> d'Étampes to be set against him and refused to conciliate with the king's favorites. He could no longer silence his enemies by the sword, as he had silenced those in Rome. As a result, after about five years of invested work but continual jealousy and violence, Cellini returned to Florence, where he continued as a goldsmith and became the rival of sculptor Baccio Bandinelli, who died {{a few years later}} in 1560.|$|E
25|$|Princess Beatrix married Claus von Amsberg on 10 March 1966 {{in civil}} and {{religious}} ceremonies. The bride wore a traditional gown with train in <b>duchesse</b> silk satin, designed by Caroline Bergé-Farwick of Maison Linette, in Den Bosch, and the Württemberg Ornate Pearl Tiara. The senior bridesmaids were the bride’s youngest sister, Princess Christina of the Netherlands; Princess Christina of Sweden, Lady Elisabeth Anson, Joanna Roëll, Eugénie Loudon and the bridegroom’s sister, Christina von Amsberg. The junior bridesmaids were Daphne Stewart-Clark and Carolijn Alting von Geusau, with page boys Joachim Jencquel and Markus von Oeynhausen-Sierstorpff.|$|E
25|$|She {{has also}} taken {{roles in the}} theatre. French has {{appeared}} in plays such as A Midsummer Night's Dream, My Brilliant Divorce, and Smaller, which last is about a schoolteacher caring for her disabled mother. January 2007 saw French performing as the <b>Duchesse</b> de Crackentorp at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, London, in The Daughter of the Regiment (La fille du régiment) by Gaetano Donizetti. Soprano Natalie Dessay and tenor Juan Diego Flórez were the leads in the production. French returned to Covent Garden and La Fille du règiment in the 2010 revival.|$|E
6000|$|... 'All the {{servants}} I {{came in contact}} with played the incorruptible; but still I have done something. There were some fellows in the village who are not at their ease under that rule. I caused my people to inquire them out. They knew nothing more than that the old heretic Gardon with his family had gone away in Madame la <b>Duchesse's</b> litter, but whither they could not tell. But the cabaretier there is furious secretly with the Quinets for having spoilt his trade by destroying the shrine at the holy well, and I have made him understand that it will be for his profit to send me off intelligence so soon as there is any communication between them and the lady. I made the same arrangement with a couple of gendarmes of the escort the Duke gave me. So at least we are safe for intelligence such as would hinder a marriage.' ...|$|R
60|$|All was, as Maitre Isaac had said, decorum itself. A {{couple of}} armed retainers, rigid as sentinels, {{waited on the}} steps; a grave porter, maimed in the wars opened the great door; half a dozen--laquais in sober though rich liveries {{sat on a bench}} in the hall, and had {{somewhat}} the air of having been set to con a lesson. Two of them coming respectfully forward, ushered Maitre Gardon and his companion to an ante-room, where various gentlemen, or pastors, or candidates--among them Samuel Mace--were awaiting a summons to the Duchess, or merely using it as a place of assembly. A page of high birth, but well schooled in steadiness of demeanour, went at once to announce the arrival; and Gardon and his companion had not been many moments in conversation with their acquaintance among the ministers, before the grave gentleman returned, apparently from his audience and the page, coming to Eustacie, intimated that she was to follow him to Madame le <b>Duchesse's</b> presence.|$|R
25|$|Alphonse Thys {{was engaged}} to teach Edmond counterpoint, composition, and solfège. He entered the Conservatoire de Paris and studied harmony under Napoléon Henri Reber. His {{pre-existing}} frailty, the rigours of the conservatory curriculum, his chronic gastrointestinal problem and the internal pressures of his concealed and perhaps mistrusted homosexuality led to periods of great musical productivity alternating with stretches of illness and inactivity. In 1860 Alfred Beaumont, director of the Opéra-Comique asked Edmond to supply the music for a libretto by Roger de Beauvoir. He composed an opéra bouffe, Un baiser de <b>duchesse,</b> but Beaumont left the Opéra-Comique {{before it could be}} produced. Depression and family pressure to marry ensued.|$|E
