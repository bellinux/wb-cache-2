5|$|In the Philosophie Zoologique, Lamarck {{proposed}} that species could acquire new characteristics from influences in their environment, in two rules that he named as laws. His first law stated that use or disuse of a body's structures would {{cause them to}} grow or shrink {{in the course of}} several generations. His second law held that any changes made in this way would be inherited. Together, Lamarck's laws <b>imply</b> <b>the</b> steady adaptation of animals to their environments.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{held that}} {{unless and until}} the suspect {{actually}} stated that he was relying on that right, his subsequent voluntary statements {{could be used in}} court and police could continue to interact with (or question) him. The mere act of remaining silent was, on its own, insufficient to <b>imply</b> <b>the</b> suspect has invoked his or her rights. Furthermore, a voluntary reply even after lengthy silence could be construed as implying a waiver.|$|E

In particular the diamond principle and the diamond plus principle are both independent of the axioms of ZFC. Also ♣ + CH implies ◊, but Shelah gave models of ♣ + ¬ CH, so ◊ and ♣ are not equivalent (rather, ♣ is weaker than ◊).|$|R

5|$|A fossil {{discovered}} in the Horse Room of the Salamander Cave in the Black Hills of South Dakota may possibly be C.dirus; if so, this fossil {{is one of the}} earliest specimens on record. It was catalogued as Canis cf. C.dirus (where cf. in Latin means confer, uncertain). The fossil of a horse found in the Horse Room provided a uranium-series dating of 252,000 yearsYBP and the Canis cf. dirus specimen was assumed to be from the same period. C.armbrusteri and C.dirus share some characteristics (synapomorphies) that <b>imply</b> <b>the</b> latter's descent from the former. The fossil record suggests C.dirus originated around 250,000YBP in the open terrain of the mid-continent before expanding eastward and displacing its ancestor C.armbrusteri. The first appearance of C.dirus would therefore be 250,000YBP in California and Nebraska, and later {{in the rest of the}} United States, Canada, Mexico, Venezuela, Ecuador, Bolivia, and Peru, but the identity of these earliest fossils is not confirmed.|$|E
5|$|A {{man with}} a tattooed tree {{on his chest and}} back is {{introduced}} in the opening minutes of Carnivàles pilot episode, and appears in many other Avataric visions and dreams: in Ben's and Brother Justin's common recurring dreams chasing Henry Scudder in a cornfield, in Ben's microsleep-like visions, in Sofie's visions of the rape of her mother, and in an extended vision of Brother Justin foreshadowing his dark future. Ben encounters a little boy with a similar tree painted to his chest and back late in Season 1. Brother Justin finds this tree grown on a hill early in Season 2, which prompts him to get his chest and back tattooed accordingly. The tree is also depicted in the show's Gospel of Matthias book, in a painting at the Templar Hall in Loving, New Mexico, and on many images in the room of Templar chaplain Kerrigan. Management and Wilfred Talbot Smith <b>imply</b> <b>the</b> tree's significance for the resolution of Carnivàle.|$|E
5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily <b>imply</b> <b>the</b> more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E

5|$|Another {{study has}} implicated EFS in the Chediak-Higashi {{syndrome}} (CHS). This rare and severe autosomal recessive disorder associated with partial albinism, peripheral neuropathy, mild coagulation defects and propensity to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, caused by incomplete phagocytosis due to failure in phagolysosome formation. This work identified a direct interaction in vitro and in vivo between EFS and LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator, aka CHS1 - Chediak-Higashi syndrome 1), a large protein that regulates the intracellular trafficking of proteins through endosomes that is mutated in CHS. These results may <b>imply</b> <b>the</b> role of EFS {{as a disease}} progression modifier, although further testing and establishment of mechanism is necessary.|$|E
5|$|The {{right to}} vote in Singapore is not {{explicitly}} stated in Singapore's Constitution, but the Government has expressed the view {{that it may be}} inferred from the fact that Singapore is a representative democracy and from specific constitutional provisions, including Articles 65 and 66 which set out requirements for the prorogation and dissolution of Parliament and the holding of general elections. Speaking on the matter in Parliament in 2009, the Minister for Law, K. Shanmugam, said that the {{right to vote}} could not be a mere privilege as this would <b>imply</b> <b>the</b> existence of an institution superior to the body of citizens that is empowered to grant such a privilege, but that no such institution exists in a free country. In 1966 a Constitutional Commission chaired by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin advocated entrenching the right to vote within the Constitution, but this was not taken up by the Parliament of the day. When this proposal was repeated during the 2009 parliamentary debate, the Government took the view that such entrenchment was unnecessary.|$|E
