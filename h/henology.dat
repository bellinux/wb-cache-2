40|$|This article situates Bernard's {{philosophy}} {{in the overall}} history of metaphysics, dating back to sources of speculation on the One which precedes speculation on Being. Returning to the practices of Bernard's own <b>henology,</b> it shows their close connection with an agathology where knowledge and love converge. The article concentrates on chapters 17 - 19 of Book V of De considerations where one finds a scalar <b>henology</b> which is a gem of metaphysics. The book cannot be classified as belonging to any one literary genre. It may therefore be suggested, with good reason, that beyond its origins in its own cultural era, the wisdom here expressed deserves to be claimed as a cultural heritage for all humanity.

40|$|I {{examine what}} I call Eckhart’s {{doctrine}} of indistinction as {{a precursor to}} Heidegger’s approach to the worldhood of the world. Taking cues from textual evidence in various sections of Heidegger’s texts and lecture courses, I demonstrate that Heidegger’s ontology is at least partially inherited from Eckhart’s <b>henology.</b> As a result, there is an analogous logic of indistinction operative in Eckhart’s {{understanding of the relationship}} between God and creation, and the inseparability of Dasein and the world in Heidegger’s phenomenology. I conclude by suggesting that Heidegger’s reading of Eckhart is a microcosm of the relationship between continental philosophy and religion, because it demonstrates that turning one’s eyes to the logics of a different cosmology, anthropology, or ontology, may permit the eyes to see more fully what is at play in one’s own approach to the human, the world, and the relationship between them. In other words, the secular often illuminates theological blind spots, just as the theological has the power to transform, enlarge, or supplement the secular view of the consciously secular thinker, without converting philosophy to theology or vice versa...|$|E
40|$|Given the {{richness}} of ancient philosophical texts, the maintenance of an ambivalence between freedom of interpretation and rigour of analysis requires strategies of appropriation, the fecundity of which depends on the topics treated. These strategies began in Antiquity and appear to have reached their culminating point {{with the coming of}} onto-theology as an essential expression of the history of philosophy. The author maintains that this promotion of metaphysics took place at the cost both of the multiple practices of the One and the Many that have held sway since the start of philosophy {{as well as of the}} practices of myth, of which Christian revelation is one of the variants. However, he is of the view that it is not sufficient to rehabilitate these overshadowings. Above all, it is necessary to undertake new appropriations of ancient philosophy, among which are found the multiple practices of temporality, the modes of proximity, the duality proper to doxa, as opinion and glory, the multiple practices of the logos and of the diverse narrative forms, as well as the diverse faces of meta-physics: ontology, <b>henology,</b> agathology, diaphorology, and complexity. © 2008 Revue Philosophique de Louvain.

40|$|In {{his work}} Fons Vitae, Ibn Gabirol {{presents}} a metaphysical model based on universal hylomorphism, i. e., {{on the presence}} of matter and form in all beings both corporeal and spiritual. Although considered a neoplatonic author, Ibn Gabirol does not properly present a <b>henology,</b> but starts from sensible and corporeal realities and then treats the more subtle ones. This article intends to invert the author's presentation, seeking to redesign his metaphysics from the first essence to the end of creation. To this end, the specific point that is analyzed (although in an incipient way) is the question of unity and its qualifier 'one', both in the attribution Ibn Gabirol makes in his ontological model and in the model's logical aspects. Ibn Gabirol apresenta, em sua obra Fons Vitae, um modelo metafísico baseado no hilemorfismo universal, ou seja, na presença de matéria e de forma em todos os seres, tanto corpóreos quanto espirituais. Embora considerado um autor neoplatônico, Ibn Gabirol não explicita propriamente uma henologia, mas parte das realidades sensíveis e corpóreas em direção às mais sutis. Este artigo pretende inverter essa apresentação do autor, buscando redesenhar sua metafísica a partir da Essência Primeira até o fim da criação. Para tanto, o ponto específico analisado, ainda que de modo incipiente, é a questão da unidade e seu qualificativo uno/una, tanto na atribuição que ele faz em seu modelo ontológico, quanto nos seus aspectos lógicos.

40|$|The {{conflict}} of borderlines unfolds {{itself as a}} natural path in history of human thought. It becomes clear only through an explicit cultural clash, which conveys distinct conceptual formatting. Thinking this conflict might enlighten the bindings responsible for development of contemporary way of thought. This thesis intent to analyse, in a first moment, the history of thought as Metaphysics, presenting a diagnostic towards the way through which the West impinges its categorical logic. Thereafter, presents the tradition of Negativity, showing a thinking beyond Classic Ontology through a <b>Henology</b> and a Meontology in Neoplatonism and Medieval Mysticism. At the end, exposes the Far Eastern thought as possibility of contemporary reception of Negativity and escape from the Westernizer formatting of contemporary philosophyO conflito das fronteiras se desdobra como um percurso natural da história do pensamento humano. Torna-se manifesto todavia apenas mediante um explícito choque cultural, que evidencia distintas formatações conceituais. Pensar este conflito pode esclarecer os enlaces responsáveis pelo desenvolvimento do pensamento contemporâneo. Esta tese pretende analisar, em um primeiro momento, a história do pensamento enquanto metafísica, apresentando um diagnóstico da maneira pela qual o Ocidente impinge sua lógica categórica. Por conseguinte, apresenta a tradição da negatividade, evidenciando um pensamento para além da ontologia clássica mediante uma henologia e uma meontologia no neoplatonismo e na mística medieval. Por fim, expõe o pensamento do Extremo Oriente como possiblidade de recepção contemporânea da negatividade e escapatória para a formatação ocidentalizante da filosofia vigente...|$|E
40|$|L’appartenenza alla corrente onomatodossa dell’ortodossia determina i tratti essenziali della filosofia di A. F. Losev. Essa è intesa a mostrare il rivelarsi dell’Uno nelle cose tramite il nome. L’henologia di questo autore è un’ontologia del Nome, ovvero una dimostrazione del movimento dell’autodeterminazione dell’Uno, di Dio, dell’Assoluto, nell’essere che ha come proprio “arresto”, il proprio fine, nel Nome e nei nomi. Il nome è ciò che noi sappiamo della cosa ed è ciò che la cosa conosce di se stessa. Nel nome è racchiusa tutta la cosa, ma la cosa non è il proprio nome. Non si può conoscere una cosa senza saperne il nome. La dialettica delle cose è una dialettica dei nomi. La dialettica del mondo e dell’essere è una dialettica del Nome con cui si danno il mondo e l’essere.  The {{belonging}} to the onomatodoxy stream of the Orthodoxy determines the essential features of the philosophy of A.

The <b>henology</b> of this author functions as ontology of the Name, or the demonstration of {{the movement of the}} self-determination of the One, of God, of the Absolute, in the Being which is as its own “arrest”, its own aim, in the Name and in the names. The thing is known by the name and the name is the mean by which the thing is known by itself. Into the name the thing is harbored, but the thing is not exactly the name. The thing cannot be known without knowing its name. The dialectics of the things is a dialectics of the names. The dialectics {{of the world and the}} being is a dialectics of the name with which the world and the being are given. create a new “first philosophy” in which the problem relating to the possibility of knowledge in general, and abstract knowledge in particular, can be explained from an original experience of being as "pan-unity" or "absolute unity". e spiritual universe of Losev, based on a strict Platonism, is not contradictory with Florensky’one. Not denying any of these realities, it proposes a critical access to them and allows them to face more productive confrontations...|$|E
40|$|John 17 : 21 - 23, Jesus 2 ̆ 7 {{prayer for}} the unity of all believers, has been {{interpreted}} frequently as a petition for the healing of institutional division among followers of Jesus. The history of research provided in chapter one shows that this 2 ̆ 2 institutional 2 ̆ 2 interpretation gained ascendancy largely after Rudolf Bultmann 2 ̆ 7 s landmark commentary on the Gospel of John. Bultmann decried what he perceived as the 2 ̆ 2 sacramentalizing 2 ̆ 2 of unity {{by some of the}} early Church Fathers, who conceived the notion of ontological unity in respect to sacramental Eucharist. This study pursues an 2 ̆ 2 ontological 2 ̆ 2 approach, which suggests that all believers may be ontologically united with Jesus and the Father. In chapter two, the pericope 2 ̆ 7 s repetitive structure is examined, a grammatical and lexical analysis is given, and several diagrammatic attempts to understand the notion of indwelling are offered to explain the meaning of unity proposed by the passage. Chapter three undertakes a compositional analysis of the theme of unity in the entire Gospel to show how unity is portrayed among believers, Jesus, and the Father. Although Jesus and the Father 2 ̆ 7 s relationship is portrayed as a unity which maintains distinction, the proposed ontological unity of all believers based on the unity of Jesus and the Father remains impervious to the insights yielded by utilizing these traditional tools of biblical exegesis. This suggests that an alternative tool which lends itself to an ontological approach to the notion of unity is required for exegetical assistance. In chapter four, the third-century Neoplatonist, Plotinus, contributes a unique perspective to the topic of unity which is central to this passage. Although later than the Fourth Gospel, and so not influential as a source, Plotinus 2 ̆ 7 <b>henology</b> philosophy about the One) provides excellent insight into the 2 ̆ 2 problem of the One and the many, 2 ̆ 2 and lends itself to a fuller understanding of the meaning of John 17 : 21 - 23. Chapter five concludes that the unity of all believers may be conceived as a participation by believers in the unity of being which is shared by the Father and the Son as one God...|$|E
