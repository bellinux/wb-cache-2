5|$|The {{pathogenicity}} of prions and proteins with prion-like domains {{arises from}} their self-templating ability {{and the resulting}} exponential growth of amyloid fibrils. The presence of amyloid fibrils in patients with <b>degenerative</b> diseases has been well documented. These amyloid fibrils are seen {{as the result of}} pathogenic proteins that self-propagate and form highly stable, non-functional aggregates. While this does not necessarily imply a causal relationship between amyloid and <b>degenerative</b> diseases, the toxicity of certain amyloid forms and the overproduction of amyloid in familial cases of <b>degenerative</b> disorders supports the idea that amyloid formation is generally toxic.|$|E
5|$|In October 2014, Horton was {{diagnosed}} with a <b>degenerative</b> back injury of the lumbar region that ended his 2014–15 season and threatens to end his career.|$|E
5|$|This breed {{is equally}} {{suitable}} {{as a family}} dog or a working terrier, given the right training. It is affected by few breed specific breed disorders, with the only two prevalent conditions being lens luxation and canine <b>degenerative</b> myelopathy.|$|E
5|$|According to the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel {{and other}} sources, during the {{physical}} after the trade, Favre {{was diagnosed with}} avascular necrosis of the hip, the same <b>degenerative</b> condition that ended running back Bo Jackson's football career, and doctors recommended his physical be failed, which would nullify the trade. Wolf overruled them.|$|E
5|$|In a 2009 {{study of}} 16 Portuguese edible wild {{mushroom}} species, R.botrytis {{was shown to}} have the highest concentration of phenolic acids (356.7mg per kg of fresh fruit body), made up largely of protocatechuic acid; it also had the highest antioxidant capacity. Phenolic compounds—common in fruits and vegetables—are being scientifically investigated for their potential health benefits associated with reduced risk of chronic and <b>degenerative</b> diseases.|$|E
5|$|LTP has {{received}} much attention {{among those who}} study Alzheimer's disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease that causes marked cognitive decline and dementia. Much of this deterioration occurs in association with <b>degenerative</b> changes in the hippocampus and other medial temporal lobe structures. Because of the hippocampus' well established role in LTP, {{some have suggested that}} the cognitive decline seen in individuals with AD may result from impaired LTP.|$|E
5|$|Postovulatory follicles are {{structures}} formed after oocyte release; they do {{not have}} endocrine function, present a wide irregular lumen, and are rapidly reabsorbed in a process involving the apoptosis of follicular cells. A <b>degenerative</b> process called follicular atresia reabsorbs vitellogenic oocytes not spawned. This process can also occur, but less frequently, in oocytes in other development stages.|$|E
5|$|A stylized {{flower of}} a Hippeastrum {{cultivar}} (under its common name of amaryllis) is used internationally {{as a symbol}} for organizations associated with Huntington's disease, a genetic <b>degenerative</b> disease of the nervous system. The widely used logo represents a double image of a head and shoulders as the flower of a growing and vibrant plant. The reduced size of the inner head and shoulders image symbolizes the diminution in a person caused by Huntington's disease. The leaves represent the protection, purpose, growth {{and development of the}} Huntington's community worldwide in its search for a cure and treatment.|$|E
5|$|After an All-American {{career at}} the University of Notre Dame, Bavaro was drafted by the Giants in the fourth round (#100 overall) in the 1985 NFL Draft. He quickly emerged as a starter in his rookie season and became renowned during his Giants career for his blocking, toughness, and {{receiving}} skills. After a <b>degenerative</b> knee condition forced him to sit out the 1991 season, he returned to play three seasons for the Browns and Eagles before retiring in 1995. Since retiring Bavaro has done work as a pro-life activist. His brother David also played in the NFL for four seasons.|$|E
5|$|Bavaro {{struggled}} with a <b>degenerative</b> knee condition throughout the 1990 season and was rarely able to practice. The Giants cut him in July 1991 {{because of the}} injury. After some initial dispute, the Giants signed him to a one-year US$310,000 contract and placed him on the physically unable to perform list. He spent the season as a tight end coach at Saint Dominic Savio High School in East Boston, Massachusetts. He took the position after the team's coach took a chance and wrote Bavaro a letter to {{ask him if he}} would consider coaching.|$|E
5|$|Discectomy (the partial {{removal of}} a disc that is causing leg pain) can provide pain relief sooner than nonsurgical treatments. Discectomy has better {{outcomes}} at one year but not at four to ten years. The less invasive microdiscectomy has not been shown {{to result in a}} different outcome than regular discectomy. For most other conditions, there is not enough evidence to provide recommendations for surgical options. The long-term effect surgery has on <b>degenerative</b> disc disease is not clear. Less invasive surgical options have improved recovery times, but evidence regarding effectiveness is insufficient.|$|E
5|$|Fighters such as Bob Probert and Boogaard {{have been}} posthumously {{diagnosed}} with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a <b>degenerative</b> {{disease of the}} brain caused by repeated brain trauma. While the NHL took steps to limit head trauma from blindslide hits, it was criticized for doing nothing to reduce fighting, which consists of repeated deliberate blows to the head. It is unknown if Boogaard's death was mainly attributed from his repeated head trauma from fighting and hits or from a possible addiction to painkillers while simultaneously abusing alcohol. His brain has been sent to Boston University for further testing.|$|E
5|$|The {{brain is}} {{protected}} by the skull, suspended in cerebrospinal fluid, and isolated from the bloodstream by the blood–brain barrier. However, the brain is still susceptible to damage, disease, and infection. Damage {{can be caused by}} trauma, or a loss of blood supply known as a stroke. The brain is susceptible to <b>degenerative</b> disorders, such as Parkinson's disease, dementias including Alzheimer's disease, and multiple sclerosis. Psychiatric conditions, including schizophrenia and clinical depression, are thought to be associated with brain dysfunctions. The brain can also be the site of tumours, both benign and malignant; these mostly originate from other sites in the body.|$|E
5|$|The list {{of medical}} {{problems}} that can produce cerebellar damage is long, including stroke, hemorrhage, swelling of the brain (cerebral edema), tumors, alcoholism, physical trauma such as gunshot wounds or explosives, and chronic <b>degenerative</b> conditions such as olivopontocerebellar atrophy. Some forms of migraine headache may also produce temporary dysfunction of the cerebellum, of variable severity. Infection can result in cerebellar damage in such conditions as the prion diseases and Miller Fisher syndrome, a variant of Guillain–Barré syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Chromium, arsenic, cadmium, mercury, {{and lead}} have the {{greatest}} potential to cause harm on account of their extensive use, the toxicity {{of some of their}} combined or elemental forms, and their widespread distribution in the environment. Hexavalent chromium, for example, is highly toxic as are mercury vapour and many mercury compounds. These five elements have a strong affinity for sulfur; in the human body they usually bind, via thiol groups (–SH), to enzymes responsible for controlling the speed of metabolic reactions. The resulting sulfur-metal bonds inhibit the proper functioning of the enzymes involved; human health deteriorates, sometimes fatally. Chromium (in its hexavalent form) and arsenic are carcinogens; cadmium causes a <b>degenerative</b> bone disease; and mercury and lead damage the central nervous system.|$|E
5|$|Excavators {{found the}} body of the Haraldskær Woman in a supine {{position}} in an excellent state of preservation. She was naked and her clothes, consisting of a leather cape and three woolen garments, had been placed on top of her. Hurdles of branches and wooden poles pinned the body down. The complete skin envelope and the internal organs were both intact. The body had a lancing wound to the knee joint area, where some object (possibly one of the sharp poles) penetrated to some depth. Her skin was deeply bronzed with a robust skin tone due to tannins in the peat, and all the body joints were preserved with overlying skin in a state as if she had died only recently. Doctors determined she had been about 50 years old when she died and in good health without signs of <b>degenerative</b> diseases (such as arthritis) which are typically found in human remains of that age.|$|E
5|$|Speculation {{regarding}} {{moves to}} the Premier League came to nothing. By October, Žigić had appeared just once for Valencia, in the UEFA Cup, and an opportunity arose to join his former club, Racing Santander, on an emergency loan. This depended on the league allowing Racing to release Luis Fernández on medical grounds, because of a <b>degenerative</b> condition of his knee, thus freeing up a space in the first-team squad. The LFP's medical committee decided that the condition was not yet clearly career-ending, so any agreement with Žigić had to be held over until the January 2009 transfer window. In the meantime, he played in four more cup matches for Valencia, two domestic and two UEFA, and scored in three of them, but took no part in the league campaign.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of ways to {{classify}} low back pain with no consensus that any one method is best. There are three general types of low back pain by cause: mechanical back pain (including nonspecific musculoskeletal strains, herniated discs, compressed nerve roots, <b>degenerative</b> discs or joint disease, and broken vertebra), non-mechanical back pain (tumors, inflammatory conditions such as spondyloarthritis, and infections), and referred pain from internal organs (gallbladder disease, kidney stones, kidney infections, and aortic aneurysm, among others). Mechanical or musculoskeletal problems underlie most cases (around 90% or more), and of those, most (around 75%) do not have a specific cause identified, but are thought to be due to muscle strain or injury to ligaments. Rarely, complaints of low back pain result from systemic or psychological problems, such as fibromyalgia and somatoform disorders.|$|E
5|$|Despite initial {{concerns}} that the Queen might be barren, Henry and Eleanor had five children together. In 1239 Eleanor gave birth to their first child, Edward, named after the Confessor. Henry was overjoyed and held huge celebrations, giving lavishly to the Church and to the poor to encourage God to protect his young son. Their first daughter, Margaret, named after Eleanor's sister, followed in 1240, her birth also accompanied by celebrations and donations to the poor. Henry's third child, Beatrice, was named after his mother-in-law, and born in 1242 during a campaign in Poitou. Their fourth child, Edmund, arrived in 1245 and was named after the 9th-century saint: concerned about Eleanor's health, Henry donated {{large amounts of money}} to the Church throughout the pregnancy. A third daughter, Katherine, was born in 1253 but soon fell ill, possibly the result of a <b>degenerative</b> disorder such as Rett syndrome, and was unable to speak. She died in 1257 and Henry was distraught. Henry's children spent most of their childhood at Windsor Castle and he appears to have been extremely attached to them, rarely spending extended periods of time apart from his family.|$|E
25|$|It may {{be caused}} by wear and tear (<b>degenerative</b> joint disease), injury (traumatic arthritis), surgery (secondary <b>degenerative</b> joint disease), {{inflammation}} (rheumatoid arthritis) or infection (septic arthritis).|$|E
25|$|Another form of {{secondary}} scoliosis is the <b>degenerative</b> scoliosis which develops {{later in life}} secondary to <b>degenerative</b> (may {{or may not be}} associated with aging) changes. This is a type of deformity that starts and progresses because of the collapse of the vertebral column in an asymmetrical manner.|$|E
25|$|Chronic inflammation. Examples include auto-immune {{mechanisms}} and <b>degenerative</b> valvular lesions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Degenerative</b> {{failures}} {{are those}} {{caused by the}} slow deterioration of performance over time.|$|E
25|$|Osteoarthritis of the {{temporomandibular}} joint, a <b>degenerative</b> {{joint disease}} of the articular surfaces.|$|E
25|$|Keratoconus - a <b>degenerative</b> disease, {{the cornea}} thins and changes shape {{to be more}} like a cone.|$|E
25|$|The exact {{causes of}} the <b>degenerative</b> process remain unclear. There are, however, some {{hypotheses}} and well-defined risk factors.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{radiographic}} findings include joint effusion and <b>degenerative</b> {{changes such as}} {{joint space}} narrowing, subchondral sclerosis, and osteophyte formation.|$|E
25|$|Asteroid {{hyalosis}} is a <b>degenerative</b> {{condition of}} the eye involving small white opacities in the vitreous humor. The cause is unknown.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{conditions}} in dogs may be aggravated by or may show slow or no improvement {{as a result}} of weight bearing exercise. Among these are hip dysplasia and osteochondritis dissecans (OCD), conditions most common in medium to large purebred dogs, such as German Shepherds, Labrador Retrievers or Golden Retrievers; chronic <b>degenerative</b> radiculomyelopathy (CDRM), a <b>degenerative</b> disease of the spinal cord which causes hind limb problems in German Shepherds; and luxating patella which is seen predominantly in small and toy breeds.|$|E
25|$|Synchysis {{scintillans}} is a <b>degenerative</b> {{condition of}} the eye resulting in liquified vitreous humor and the accumulation of cholesterol crystals within the vitreous.|$|E
25|$|Animal {{trials are}} set to begin on a gene therapy for {{amyotrophic}} lateral sclerosis – a <b>degenerative</b> condition which counts Stephen Hawking among its sufferers.|$|E
25|$|Most {{morphological}} {{changes and}} injuries are sustained to the supraspinatus tendon. Traumatic rotator cuff changes are often located antero-superior, meanwhile <b>degenerative</b> changes more likely are supero-posterior.|$|E
25|$|Scottish folds {{are also}} prone to <b>degenerative</b> joint disease, most {{commonly}} affecting the tail, ankles, and knees which {{can result in}} reduced range of motion.|$|E
25|$|Ringbone is <b>degenerative</b> (unless it {{is caused}} by direct trauma). Treatment works {{to slow down the}} {{progress}} of the bony changes and alleviate the horse's pain, rather than working to cure it.|$|E
25|$|In {{most parts}} of Australia, hearing {{screening}} via AABR testing is mandated, meaning that essentially all congenital (i.e., not those related to later onset <b>degenerative</b> disorders) auditory neuropathy cases should be diagnosed at birth.|$|E
25|$|Alcoholic {{polyneuropathy}} is {{very similar}} to other axonal <b>degenerative</b> polyneuropathies and therefore can be difficult to diagnose. When alcoholics have sensorimotor polyneuropathy as well as a nutritional deficiency, a diagnosis of alcoholic polyneuropathy is often reached.|$|E
