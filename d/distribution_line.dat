40|$|Abstract. In the Czech Republic are <b>distribution</b> <b>lines</b> {{with bare}} {{conductors}} replaced by <b>distribution</b> <b>lines</b> with covered conductor. The PAS system with covered conductors has many {{advantages and disadvantages}} that are described below. This article describes issue of fault detection for <b>distribution</b> <b>lines</b> with covered conductors, dependence of partial discharges on fault and finally the design plus realization fault detection of covered conductors. This is a prototype which will be tested and then optimized. The system {{will be used for}} different voltage levels and different types of outdoor <b>distribution</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{wind farm}} generates enough {{electricity}} to supply around 30,000 average South Australian homes. The Canunda Wind Farm <b>distribution</b> <b>line</b> is 16 km long and transports the generated electricity {{from the wind}} farm to a nearby substation at Snuggery. The <b>distribution</b> <b>line</b> traverses mostly roadside verges, avoiding areas of environmental sensitivity along the route. The Canunda Wind Farm provides a number of benefits to the local and wider community, including clean electricity generation, enhanced agricultural viability of the farms involved and increased diversity of electricity supply for South Australia and the south east in particular. There has also been widespread community interest in the project and site tours have commenced.|$|E

To ensure the privacy of SET’s customers, their locations and the geometry of the 180 primary <b>distribution</b> <b>lines</b> is not explicitly exposed.|$|R
40|$|A common {{difficulty}} {{in the analysis}} and design of transmission and <b>distribution</b> <b>lines</b> is to determine a conductor’s tension and its static profile under concentrated loads. For relatively small concentrated loads (such as detuning pendulums on transmission lines), approximation methods may give good predictions. For large concentrated loads (such as fallen trees on <b>distribution</b> <b>lines),</b> however, exact solutions must be found. This paper presents methodologies to compute conductor tension and static profile in three dimensional space using both approximate and exact solution procedures under con-centrated loads with different boundary conditions. Practical engineering examples from galloping control of transmission lines and mechanical coordination of <b>distribution</b> <b>lines</b> are given to demon-strate {{the applicability of the}} theory. KEY WORDS...|$|R
2500|$|Classical {{electromagnetic}} induction can occur when long conductors form an open grounded loop under and parallel to transmission or <b>distribution</b> <b>lines.</b> [...] In these cases, current is induced {{in the loop}} when a person makes contact with it and ground. [...] Since this involves real current flow, it is potentially hazardous. [...] This type of induced current occurs most often on long fences and <b>distribution</b> <b>lines</b> built under high-power transmission lines.|$|R

50|$|While the {{operating}} quality of these devices, and especially of protective relays, is always critical, different strategies are considered {{for protecting the}} {{different parts of the}} system.

50|$|SWER’s main {{advantage}} is its low cost. It {{is often used}} in sparsely populated areas where {{the cost of building}} an isolated <b>distribution</b> <b>line</b> cannot be justified. Capital costs are roughly 50% of an equivalent two-wire single-phase line. They can cost 30% of 3-wire three-phase systems. Maintenance costs are roughly 50% of an equivalent line.|$|E

50|$|Electric power {{distribution}} {{is the final}} stage {{in the delivery of}} electric power; it carries electricity from the transmission system to individual consumers. Distribution substations connect to the transmission system and lower the transmission voltage to medium voltage ranging between 2 kV and 35 kV with the use of transformers. Primary <b>distribution</b> <b>lines</b> carry this medium voltage power to distribution transformers located near the customer's premises. Distribution transformers again lower the voltage to the utilization voltage used by lighting, industrial equipment or household appliances. Often several customers are supplied from one transformer through secondary <b>distribution</b> <b>lines.</b> Commercial and residential customers are connected to the secondary <b>distribution</b> <b>lines</b> through service drops. Customers demanding a much larger amount of power may be connected directly to the primary distribution level or the subtransmission level.|$|R
