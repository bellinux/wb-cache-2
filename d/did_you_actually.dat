5000|$|Early February 2011: Decided to make {{an album}} {{inspired}} by the Japanese post-war economic miracle. While searching for more information I found an old photo of the Mihama nuclear plant. The fact that this futuristic-looking plant was situated in such a beautiful spot {{so close to the}} sea made me curious. Are they safe when it comes to earthquakes and tsunamis? Further reading revealed that many of these plants are situated in earthquake-prone areas, some of them are even located next to shores that had been hit in the past by tsunamis.A photo of Mihama made me narrow down my focus only to Japanese nuclear plants. I wanted to make a soundtrack to some of them, concentrating on the architecture, design and localizations, but also questioning the potential radiation danger (a cooling system being destroyed by a landslide or earthquake, etc). As the head of the Nuclear and Industrial Safety Agency said: [...] "the plants were so well designed that 'such a situation is practically impossible'.The album was finished on February 13th. On March 17th I received the following message from a Facebook friend: 'Geir, some time ago you asked people for a photo of a Japanese nuclear powerplant.

30|$|To {{investigate}} {{the influence of}} individual trade union membership on vacation leave, we use the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP). The SOEP is a nationally representative survey conducted each year since 1984 with about 20, 000 participants belonging to approximately 11, 000 households in recent waves. 6 The (retrospective) question on vacation days has been asked from 1985 to 1990, {{as well as in}} the years 2000, 2005 and 2010 and reads as follows: “How many days of vacation <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> take last year?”. 7 Accordingly, the SOEP provides data on paid vacation from 1984 to 1989 and for the years 1999, 2004 and 2009. Information on individual trade union membership is available for 1985, 1989, 1993, 1998, 2001, 2003, 2007 and 2011. Table  5 in the Appendix summarises this temporal aspect of the data.|$|E

40|$|How do we {{navigate}} {{a deeply}} structured world? Why are you reading this sentence first – and <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> {{look at the}} fifth word? This review offers some answers by appealing to active inference based on deep temporal models. It builds on previous formulations of active inference to simulate behavioural and electrophysiological responses under hierarchical generative models of state transitions. Inverting these models corresponds to sequential inference, such that the state at any hierarchical level entails a sequence of transitions in the level below. The deep temporal aspect of these models means that evidence is accumulated over nested time scales, enabling inferences about narratives (i. e., temporal scenes). We illustrate this behaviour with Bayesian belief updating – and neuronal process theories – to simulate the epistemic foraging seen in reading. These simulations reproduce perisaccadic delay period activity and local field potentials seen empirically. Finally, we exploit the deep structure of these models to simulate responses to local (e. g., font type) and global (e. g., semantic) violations; reproducing mismatch negativity and P 300 responses respectively...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} {{the consistency of}} responses to a standardized 2 -part 2 ̆ 2 key 2 ̆ 2 question (Key-Q) about acute symptom onset in patients presenting with chest pain when measured using alternative questions (Qs) about symptom perception and decisions to seek treatment. METHODS: A structured patient interview was performed at 3 university teaching hospitals and 1 community hospital. Convenience samples of adult patients presenting to these EDs with chest pain were asked specific questions related to their symptoms and recognition of illness. Information obtained included the 2 -part Key-Q: 2 ̆ 2 What are the symptoms that brought you here today? 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 When did those symptoms start? 2 ̆ 2 The alternative Qs (in order of use) were as follows: Q 1 = 2 ̆ 2 When did your very first symptom or sensation begin? 2 ̆ 2; Q 2 = 2 ̆ 2 When did your symptoms lead you to think something was wrong or that you were ill? 2 ̆ 2; Q 3 = 2 ̆ 2 When did your symptoms become serious {{enough for you to}} seek medical care? 2 ̆ 2; and Q 4 = 2 ̆ 2 When <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> call 9 - 1 - 1 /emergency medical services (EMS) or go to the hospital? 2 ̆ 2 The documented ED arrival time, demographic variables, and whether the patient arrived by ambulance were obtained from the medical record. Patients also were queried regarding potential barriers to seeking medical care and their cardiac risk factors. RESULTS: Of the 135 patients surveyed, 9 were unsure of the date and time of symptom onset. For the 126 patients with analyzable data, the mean (+/- SD) patient age was 62 +/- 16 years, and 59...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a report about the {{research}} study; it aims to map students' views of the future, importance of goals, learning instrumentality, attribution of choice goals and conceptions of learning by students. This text also deals with the relations of these variables. The research was conducted with 106 students {{of the same age}} from a grammar school. These students attended first class of the four-year study programme and fifth class of the eight-year study programme. The variables were compared between boys and girls and between students of four and eight year study programmes. The research study used quantitative and qualitative methods. A modified version of the Inventory of motivational goals importance and learning instrumentality (De Volder, Lens, 1982) was used. It was supplemented by questions about the attributional tendencies. Another method was essays, its subject was "one day in students' future". This method was supplemented by some questions. The qualitative analysis of the data was centred upon content and time analysis and aspects such as satisfaction, realism, elaborateness and alternativeness. The conceptions of learning were analysed by students' answers to the following question: "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>actually</b> mean by learning?".

40|$|There is no {{straightforward}} answer, {{but research}} shows {{there are some}} key things to consider when choosing a school which might help determine where to send your child. Parents often face conflicting advice when deciding whether to send their child to a single-sex or coeducational school. Despite the lack of evidence, there remains a strong and widely held belief that single-sex schooling is better for girls and coeducation is better for boys. There are more single-sex schools for girls than for boys {{in each of the}} three Australian educational sectors: government, Catholic and independent. As a consequence, more boys than girls are enrolled in some coeducational schools. So as a parent, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> decide which school is best for your child?
