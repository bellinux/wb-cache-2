Featuring interviews with over 60 current and former Princetonians, as well as archival footage, I Grew Up in Princeton exposes Princeton as a town with, according to Joyce J. Persico of the Trenton Times, [...] "two realities. On the one hand, blacks were accepted in society; on the other, they were accepted as long as they stayed on their 'side' of town." [...] Racial divisions are explored in considerable depth. Former Superintendent of the Princeton Regional School District, Dr. Philip McPherson, describes the disturbing backlash resulting from his support of the teaching of James Baldwin's play Blues for Mr. Charlie in Princeton High School English classes. Ms. Persico describes a scene from the film in which <b>Dr.</b> <b>McPherson</b> discusses returning home from a particularly contentious meeting with a group of Teamsters to find [...] "a racial epithet scrawled across his driveway." ...|$|E
50|$|By age ten, Elizabeth {{was able}} to agilely move about on the leather pads which her father had {{fashioned}} for her. In 1900, Grenfell, who renamed her Kirkina, took her to Battle Harbour Hospital, where she remained for two years. A letter dated 9 November 1902 from Kirkina to a Massachusetts family who had sent Jeffries a doll, said her legs would be completed within a week by Dr. John McPherson, {{who was part of}} the mission staff. He fashioned temporary wooden artificial legs, which she quickly learned to use. Around 1903, Kirkina received her first pair of cork limbs from donors in Boston, Massachusetts and when <b>Dr.</b> <b>McPherson</b> and his wife left Labrador later that year, they took her with them first to Boston and then to Mexico. Kirkina returned to New York for schooling for two years and then returned to the McPhersons in Mexico. After four years in Mexico, Jeffries returned to Canada, in 1908 and initially lived with a nurse in Forteau. In 1912, Gaffney secured a new set of legs for Kirkina through donors in the U.S. Gaffney continued to use the story of Kirkina and other indigenous orphans to garner donations for his charitable works.|$|E

5000|$|A {{number of}} Native American tribes {{lived in the}} Republican River Valley {{throughout}} history. The Pawnee, Arapahoe and Cheyenne relied on the land for their survival. Early settlers and trappers arrived in the 1850s when the Nebraska Territory was formed. The rich river bottom soil lured many farmers into the area. According to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Native Americans told early settlers not to build big houses close to the river because of the [...] "big water." [...] In 1872, <b>Dr.</b> John <b>McPherson</b> moved from his Brownville, Nebraska home to the river valley. McPherson opened several stores and laid out lots in a town he called Republican. Once a post office was built, the town took the official name of Republican City. The Burlington Railroad reached the town in 1881, creating a booming trade center.|$|R
5000|$|The Ninewells Cancer Campaign {{was set up}} in 1990 {{following}} a successful CAT Scan fundraising appeal. The campaign was founded by <b>Dr</b> Pat <b>McPherson</b> who worked closely with Dr Jacqui Wood, who chaired the campaign from 1991, until her own death from cancer in 2011. She was succeeded as chair by Lady Fiona Fraser. Collaboration between the Ninewells Cancer Campaign and DC Thomson led to the use of Dennis the Menace as the campaign's mascot, with the slogan [...] "Help Dennis Beat the Menace". The campaign has raised over £17 million to fund equipment and research into cancer. The campaign successfully raised £2 million to fund the creation and equipping of the Jacqui Wood Cancer Centre, a research centre established at the University of Dundee's Medical School at the hospital. The campaign continues to raise funds to support the research work being undertaken at the centre.|$|R

McPherson took note of Sia's call for a continuous system of care originating with the primary care pediatrician. The AAP collaborated in this effort by asking each state’s AAP chapter to develop a Child Health Plan that set priorities for using MCHB block grants. Sia spearheaded the Hawaii planning effort, bringing together representatives from the Hawaii AAP Chapter, the UH medical school, the Hawaii Medical Association, and Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children. Armed with anecdotal evidence showing home visitors were able to promoteeffective parenting and ultimately improve outcomes, the group wrote a plan that incorporated a coordinated system of care that emphasized wellness and prevention forchildren, especially those with special needs.|$|R

The {{authors would like}} to thank <b>Dr.</b> Norman <b>McPherson</b> for sharing information related to distortion measurements of friction stir-welded plates. Welding processes involve localized heating which in turn give rise to thermal stresses and distortion. Friction stir welding (FSW) is a solid state joining process where temperatures below melting are experienced. Nonetheless, some degree of thermal heating and consequently thermal stresses develop at the joint. This study aims to quantify the stresses developed in friction stir welding of mild steel DH 36 plates, through an experimental and numerical investigation. The temperatures and transient strains developed during FSW, are experimentally measured and used to validate thermo-elastoplastic numerical models. These models are used to investigate the evolution of thermal stresses and distortion for different welding parameters.

40|$|T H I S report {{describes}} {{the results obtained}} {{in a group of}} 50 consecutive private patients with chronic rheumatoid arthritis who received chloroquine phosphate (Aralen) as the major medical agent in the management of their disease for 18 to 36 months. The average duration of treatment was 24 months. An analysis of the successes and failures in this group will be pre-sented with the clinical, laboratory and radiological changes that occurred during treatment. A dose schedule was evolved which was found to give the best results to the greatest number of patients with the least incidence of side effects. During an intensive investigation of anti-malarial compounds, it was noticed that some of the patients in the study who happened to have rheu-matoid arthritis showed an improvement in their arthritic symptoms. This led to a short term study of the effect of four antimalarial compounds on a group of 38 arthritic patients. 1 Some benefit was found in 23 of them. Several other studies have been reported since then. All of these have included patients who were treated for less than a year or who received steroids at the same time. The present study is made up of patients who were treated with chloroquine for 18 to 36 months and who had not received regular doses of steroids or phenylbutazone during the 12 months prior to the evaluation of results.

40|$|Since 2011, CGHR has {{collaborated with}} the UN Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary or {{arbitrary}} executions, providing research support to his mandate. In 2012, {{a team of researchers}} produced a ‘Research Pack’ on the threats to the right to life of journalists for an Expert Meeting held in Cambridge, ultimately contributing to the Special Rapporteur’s report that year to the Human Rights Council. In 2013, work began on a broader collaboration studying violations of the right to life across the African continent, culminating in a report, ‘Unlawful Killings in Africa,’ to guide the Special Rapporteur’s future activity. In 2014, a CGHR research team began a study of how the use of information and communication technologies affects the right to life, resulting in this report and the ICTs and Human Rights blog. This report was originally a discussion document prepared by CGHR Research Associate <b>Dr</b> Ella <b>McPherson</b> in collaboration with the mandate of the Special Rapporteur and ahead of a meeting of experts held in Cambridge in February 2015. The discussion document, as well as the discussion at the expert meeting, contributed to the Special Rapporteur’s thematic report on the use of information and communications technologies to secureThe use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) is creating a wealth of new opportunities as well as a variety of new risks for human rights practice. Given the pace of innovation in the development and use of ICTs, our understanding of their impact on human rights lags. This report provides a crucial and in depth look at ICT initiatives and trends across the key human rights practices of prevention, fact-finding, and advocacy, identifying both risks and opportunities. In prevention, ICTs can be harnessed to protect human rights defenders, to prevent violations in police-civilian interactions, and in data-driven early warning systems and communication-based conflict prevention. That said, ICTs also create new security risks for human rights defenders and can violate the right to privacy. In fact-finding, ICTs afford the spontaneous and solicited participation of civilian witnesses in the production of human rights evidence. Of course, a greater volume and variety of information from unknown and untrained sources creates problems of misinformation and verification, which technology only goes so far to mitigate. In advocacy, ICTs provide new channels for quickly and visibly mobilizing publics, for directly engaging with advocacy targets, and for spreading awareness of human rights. That said, the effects of these new advocacy channels are unclear, and they may imperil categories of human rights and the reputations of human rights organizations. The report also considers how digital divides and the political economy of ICTs influence the nature, extent, and distribution of these opportunities and risks. In doing so, it outlines a research framework for understanding ICTs and human rights practice to underpin academics’ and practitioners’ assessment, development, and deployment of ICTs for and in the spirit of human rights. An earlier version of this report, prepared for an expert meeting ahead of the June 2015 session of the UN Human Rights Council, informed the thematic report on ICTs and the right to life presented at that session by the Special Rapporteur on extrajudicial, summary, or arbitrary executions. As such, the projects profiled represent a snapshot of that timeframe; this report is therefore accompanied by a regularly updated, student-run Tumblr blog, ictandhr. tumblr. com, which welcomes submissions on new initiatives...|$|R

Introduction by Professor Virginia Berridge, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. Annotated and edited transcript of a Witness Seminar held on 12 October 2004. Introduction by Professor Virginia Berridge, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The 1974 reorganization of the National Health Service was largely seen as {{a disaster for the}} public health profession. The post of Medical Officer of Health, with its links to local government, was replaced by the community physician, located within health services. The technician-manager rather than the activist role predominated: community medicine doctors carried little weight by comparison with their clinical colleagues. Chaired by Professor Virginia Berridge this Witness Seminar examined the decline and rise of 'public health' both nationally and internationally in the 1980 s and 1990 s: the impact of the 1988 Acheson Report on public health medicine on a demoralized profession; the role of new ideas about health promotion imported from the international scene; the rise of evidence-based medicine and health services research, and their impact on public health; and the movement for multidisciplinary public health (MDPH) as a new avenue for public health from the 1990 s. Participants included Professor Sir Donald Acheson, Professor John Ashton, Professor Nick Black, Professor David Blane, Dr Tim Carter, Sir Iain Chalmers, Dr Aileen Clarke, Dr June Crown, Dr Jeff French, Professor Alan Glynn, Ms Shirley Goodwin, Professor Rod Griffiths, Professor Walter Holland, Professor Klim <b>McPherson,</b> <b>Dr</b> Ornella Moscucci, Dr Geoffrey Rivett, Professor Alwyn Smith and Professor Ann Taket.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} winding up on the just and {{equitable}} ground, mainly at the instance of members as contributories. The typical cases are (a) where the object for which the company was formed is impossible of further or any attainment;. and (b) where the petitioner has lost confidence in the controllers or, {{in the case of}} a quasi-partnership, in other members. In either case the petitioning contributory seeks to be relieved from his contractual obligation to contribute to the capital of the company or, {{in the case of a}} company limited by guarantee, to contribute in the event of its being wound up and in an article in (1964) 27 Modern Law Review 282, 305 <b>Dr.</b> B. H. <b>McPherson</b> suggested that Winding up on the just and equitable ground might amount to little more than the application to that contractual obligation of the doctrines of discharge by frustration and on account of breach. This thesis originally set out to verify that hypothesis, but in the course of study it became apparent that the contractual analysis was an aid to understanding rather than a complete solution to the problems presented by Section 222 (1) (h). In the first place, a winding up order is a discretionary equitable remedy, so that the common law doctrines of discharge by frustration and on account of breach are modified by the discretionary considerations applicable to equitable remedies generally and in particular equitable remedies in contract. Secondly, it is submitted, the Court does not apply those doctrines directly or even by analogy. Their apparent application stems from the fact that in the majority of cases they do produce a result which is just and equitable. The Court, looking to those ultimate reasons rather than to any application of common law doctrine, usually comes to the same result - but not always. There are cases where a remedy is granted in the absence of circumstances analogous to frustration or breach as well as cases where an order is refused notwithstanding that those circumstances have been shown to obtain. The main illustration is afforded by the Court's recognition of what Sir Owen Dixon once called "general intention and common understanding among the members". A company may have a great many objects stated in its memorandum and its articles may be in standard form, but if there is an express or implied arrangement among the members that its activities are to be directed to one object only or as to the manner in which its affairs are to be conducted the Court will have regard to that arrangement. If the main object becomes impossible or if the understanding among the members breaks down, although the contract expressed in the memorandum and articles has not been frustrated or breached, it may be just and equitable that the company be wound up. Although the contractual analysis has been retained as an invaluable aid, the thesis is now more than just a verification of the original hypothesis. It covers the field generally but concentrates on those areas where an original contribution seemed possible. The main such area is the concept of general intention and common understanding, which not only requires the contractual analysis to be modified but also that attention be given to problems of enforcement against persons not parties to the arrangement and to the consequences in terms of admissible proof. The law and principles of equity are stated from materials available to me in Melbourne at approximately 30 th June, 1973. Restricted Access: University of Melbourne Staff and Students Onl...|$|R
