5|$|A {{role-playing}} game, it {{centers on}} a battle system different <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> traditional games of the genre, with emphasis on timing and more elaborate attacks. The game is whimsical in tone, with various in-game jokes and comical references to the heritage of the Mario series. Superstar Saga was critically acclaimed, and IGN named it the twelfth best Game Boy Advance game of all time in their feature reflecting on the Game Boy Advance's lifespan. A remake of the game for Nintendo 3DS, Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions, was released on October 6, 2017.|$|E
5|$|Although Wordsworth {{places a}} similar {{emphasis}} on living {{in harmony with}} nature in his poetry, Coleridge's view is different <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Wordsworth's in that he believed that nature represents a physical presence of God's word; this is combined with a Neoplatonic understanding of God that emphasises the {{need to understand the}} divine in order to embrace it.|$|E
5|$|Although {{influenced}} by Matisse, the Oriental art that Jolin discovered at Musée Guimet {{was even more}} important to his style. Chinese and Japanese art became the base for the decorative, slightly naïve style in light colours, that he developed during the 1910s and 1920s. Jolin's style deviates <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the traditional Expressionists, in that he simplifies his motifs in an almost primitive way, painting an imagined reality rather than raw emotions.|$|E

5|$|Americium is {{paramagnetic}} {{in a wide}} temperature range, <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> liquid helium, to {{room temperature}} and above. This behavior is markedly different <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> its neighbor curium which exhibits antiferromagnetic transition at 52K. The thermal expansion coefficient of americium is slightly anisotropic and amounts to (7.5± 0.2)/°C along the shorter a axis and (6.2± 0.4)/°C for the longer c hexagonal axis. The enthalpy of dissolution of americium metal in hydrochloric acid at standard conditions is −620.6± 1.3kJ/mol, from which the standard enthalpy change of formation (ΔfH°) of aqueous Am3+ ion is −621.2± 2.0kJ/mol−1. The standard potential Am3+/Am0 is −2.08 ± 0.01V.|$|E
5|$|An Australian POW {{that was}} freed in the raid, Private Walter Gossner of the 2/15th Battalion, {{provided}} an extremely {{detailed account of}} his experiences about {{being part of a}} group of 87 POWs freed by Partisans from a location near Ožbalt. He gives the date of the raid as 27 September 1944, four weeks after the date given by Churches. His account has been posted on the internet by his family. Gossner states that he arrived at Semič 21 days after the raid, and his account varies significantly <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Churches. It is not known why Gossner's dates and other details of his account differ so markedly from Churches' account.|$|E
5|$|An {{unidentified}} dark parrot seen {{alive by}} the Swedish naturalist Fredrik Hasselqvist in Africa {{was given the}} name Psittacus obscurus by Linnaeus in 1758, who again synonymised it with the Mascarene parrot in 1766. Because of this association, some authors believed {{it was from the}} Mascarene Islands as well, but this dark parrot's description differs <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the Mascarene parrot. This disagreement led some authors to use now-invalid combinations of the scientific names, such as Mascarinus obscurus and Coracopsis obscura. The unidentified parrot may have been an African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) instead.|$|E

5|$|Another {{possible}} way {{to separate the}} trivalent actinides is via solvent extraction chromatography using bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phosphoric acid (abbreviated as HDEHP) as the stationary organic phase and nitric acid as the mobile aqueous phase. The actinide elution sequence is reversed <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the cation-exchange resin column, so that the heavier actinides elute later. The mendelevium separated by this method {{has the advantage of}} being free of organic complexing agent compared to the resin column; the disadvantage is that mendelevium then elutes very late in the elution sequence, after fermium.|$|E
5|$|Archosaurs (crocodilians and birds) {{and mammals}} show {{complete}} {{separation of the}} heart into two pumps {{for a total of}} four heart chambers; it is thought that the four-chambered heart of archosaurs evolved independently <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> mammals. In crocodilians, there is a small opening, the foramen of Panizza, {{at the base of the}} arterial trunks and there is some degree of mixing between the blood in each side of the heart, during a dive underwater; thus, only in birds and mammals are the two streams of blood – those to the pulmonary and systemic circulations – permanently kept entirely separate by a physical barrier.|$|E
5|$|As the Great Lakes assumed {{their present}} levels, the {{waterfall}} was inundated and Mackinac Island took on its current size. The steep cliffs {{were one of}} the primary reasons for the British army's choice of the island for a fortification; their decision differed <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the French army, which had built Fort Michilimackinac about 1715 near present-day Mackinaw City. The limestone formations are still part of the island's appeal. However, tourists are attracted by the natural beauty rather than the strategic value. One of the most popular geologic formations is Arch Rock, a natural limestone arch, 146feet (45m) above the ground. Other popular geologic formations include Devil's Kitchen, Skull Cave, and Sugar Loaf.|$|E

5|$|As {{with the}} {{previous}} novels in the series, aspects of Thunderball come from Fleming's own experiences: the visit to the health clinic was inspired by his own 1955 trip to the Enton Hall health farm and Bond's medical record, as read out to him by M, is a slightly modified version of Fleming's own. The name of the health farm, Shrublands, was taken <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> a house owned by the parents of his wife's friend, Peter Quennell. Fleming dedicates {{a quarter of the}} novel to the Shrublands setting and the naturalist cure Bond undergoes.|$|E
5|$|Barnum Brown and crew, {{working for}} the American Museum of Natural History in New York, {{collected}} a nearly complete articulated skeleton with a partial skull in 1915. These fossils were {{also found in the}} Dinosaur Park Formation, near Steveville, Alberta. Brown and Erich Maren Schlaikjer compared the finds, and, though they allowed that both specimens were from the same general locality and geological formation, they considered the specimen sufficiently distinct from the holotype to warrant erecting a new species, and described the fossils as Styracosaurus parksi, named in honor of William Parks. Among the differences between the specimens cited by Brown and Schlaikjer were a cheekbone quite different <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> S. albertensis, and smaller tail vertebrae. S. parksi also had a more robust jaw, a shorter dentary, and the frill differed in shape <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the type species. However, much of the skull consisted of plaster reconstruction, and the original 1937 paper did not illustrate the actual skull bones. It is now accepted as a specimen of S. albertensis.|$|E
5|$|Because {{it is so}} {{far from}} the nearest major landmass, the {{ecosystem}} of Kohala has experienced the phenomenon of geographic isolation, resulting in an ecosystem radically different <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> other places. Invasive species introduced by man present a problem to Kohala's ecosystem, as they push native species out of their habitat. There are several initiatives to preserve Kohala's ecosystem. Crops, especially sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas), have been harvested on the Leeward side of the volcano for centuries as well. The northern part of the island is named after the mountain, with two districts named North and South Kohala. King Kamehameha I, the first King of the Kingdom of Hawaii, was born in North Kohala, near Hawi.|$|E

5|$|Burnley did {{not play}} any {{pre-season}} friendly games other than a practice match between the first team and the reserves, which was watched by a crowd of around 10,000 at Turf Moor. The team's last competitive match had ended in a 0–2 defeat against Manchester United in the Lancashire Senior Cup on 8May 1920, almost four months earlier. The strip for 1920–21 was very little changed <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the previous season; the claret jersey with light blue sleeves and a light blue stripe around the collar was kept along with the white shorts, but the claret socks were replaced by black.|$|E
5|$|Caligula's {{religious}} {{policy was}} a departure <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> his predecessors. According to Cassius Dio, living emperors could be worshipped as divine {{in the east}} and dead emperors could be worshipped as divine in Rome. Augustus had the public worship his spirit on occasion, but Dio describes this as an extreme act that emperors generally shied away from. Caligula took things a step further and had those in Rome, including senators, worship him as a tangible, living god.|$|E

5|$|During the 19th {{century the}} bishop began {{to reside in}} Llandaff {{for the first time}} in centuries; no bishops of the see resided in Llandaff for almost 300 years. In 1836 there was another {{unsuccessful}} attempt to transfer the see—this time to Bristol. After the attempt at transferring the see, the office of Dean was restored to Llandaff; the position had not been filled in 700 years. The office of Dean was separated <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> the Archdeacon of Llandaff in November 1843. The restoration of the Dean's office was the beginning of better times for the cathedral. The new Dean, William Bruce Knight, was instrumental in bringing about the much-needed restorations.|$|E
5|$|During the {{formation}} of the Soviet state, in the late 1910s and early 1920s, the People's Commissariat for Finance of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) was created. The commissariat did not differ greatly <b>from</b> <b>that</b> <b>of</b> Imperial Russia's Ministry of Finance and its system. The Soviet finance ministry was a heavily centralised structure, while its predecessor was not. During its humble beginnings, the main task of the People's Commissariat of Finance were: confiscation of property, robbery and requisition; printing and creating money; and taxation.|$|E
