Subsequently, fracture area was analyzed by stereomicroscope at a magnification of × 10 and categorized into adhesive, cohesive, or mixed failure. Results: The bond strength of teeth/denture base resins interface was not significantly affected by tested solutions (P > 0. 087), except for Biolux teeth immersed in coffee (P < 0. 01). In all conditions, the Vipi Dent Plus teeth showed higher bond strength to Lucitone and Vipi Cril resins when compared to Biolux teeth (P < 0. 003). All specimens' failure modes were cohesive.

PURPOSE: This study examined the initial and subsequent wettability of an acrylic resin denture base material treated under air or argon plasma atmosphere before and after exposure to air or <b>distilled</b> water. <b>MATERIAL</b> AND METHODS: Acrylic resin specimens were treated with plasma under air or argon atmosphere and were either exposed to air or distilled water for up to 60 days. Wettability characteristics of the acrylic resin specimens were determined by contact-angle measurements after 2 hours and after 60 days. Surface composition of the specimens also was analyzed with x-ray photoelectron spectroscopic (XPS) measurements. RESULTS: Statistically significant difference was found between control and each of the plasma treatment groups (P. 05). XPS spectra of the plasma-treated specimens differed from control specimens only in the O 1 s region with a narrower and more intense peak that could be assigned to -COH groups. During 60 days of exposure, the O/C atomic ratios decreased within the first 2 weeks but settled to 0. 40 and 0. 32 up to 60 days compared with 0. 26 for untreated control specimens.

40|$|Based on archival {{research}} in six countries, this thesis <b>distils</b> new documentary <b>material</b> into {{an analysis of}} the role of Sephardic cristãos novos in the formation of Creole society in Cabo Verde and Guiné (Caboverdean space). The role of pre-existing anti-Semitic stereotypes in otherization in the Atlantic world is examined; Sephardic involvement in Cabo Verde was accompanied by transference of subalternity in the Atlantic world from Sephardim to Africans, ensuring that the cristãos novos of Cabo Verde were, indeed, masters of difference. It is argued that the cristãos novos’ doubleness of identity facilitated their success in Cabo Verde, where protean cultural identities emerged. As a destination of (successful) escape for cristãos novos fleeing the Inquisition, Cabo Verde lacked effective control by the metropolis, and was a place where an autonomous Creole identity could develop in which malleable worldviews were key. The thesis highlights the pan-Atlantic nature of the cristão novo diaspora in the 17 th century, where West Africa was of comparable importance to the American communities in Cartagena and Lima. The symbiotic relationship of hegemonies and rebellions against hegemonies is, finally, examined in this local and international framework which elucidates crucial aspects of the formation of Creole and modern identities.

The effect of water vapor on lunar soil has been studied extensively.

Moisture was introduced into the specimen by immersion in <b>distilled</b> water. Two <b>material</b> lay-ups were used in this investigation. In Kev 49 /T- 300 /Kev 49, Kevlar 49 and graphite prepreg are used as outer and center layer, respectively and in T- 300 /Kev 49 /T- 300, it was vice-versa. In both cases the tapes were alternated until the total thickness was achieved. Data for the determination of flexural strength and modulus were generated at various temperatures for both dry and saturated specimens.

40|$|Background: Decision-making {{capacity}} {{is a key}} concept in contemporary healthcare ethics. Previous research has mainly focused on philosophical, conceptual issues or on evaluation of different tools for assessing patients capacity. The aim {{of the present study}} is to investigate how the concept and its normative role are understood in Swedish psychiatric care. Of special interest for present purposes are the relationships between decisional capacity and psychiatric disorders and between health law and practical ethics. Methods: Eight in-depth interviews were conducted with Swedish psychiatrists. The interviews were analysed according to descriptive qualitative content analysis in which categories and sub-categories were <b>distilled</b> from the <b>material.</b> Results: Decision-making capacity was seen as dependent on understanding, insight, evaluation, reasoning, and abilities related to making and communicating a choice. However, also the actual content of the decision was held as relevant. There was an ambivalence regarding the relationship between psychiatric disorders and capacity and a tendency to regard psychiatric patients who made unwise treatment decisions as decisionally incapable. However, in cases relating to patients with somatic illnesses, the assumption was rather that patients who made unwise decisions were imprudent but yet decisionally capable. Conclusions: The respondents conceptions of decision-making capacity were mainly in line with standard theories. However, the idea that capacity also includes aspects relating to the content of the decision clearly deviates from the standard view. The tendency to regard imprudent choices by psychiatric patients as betokening lack of decision-making capacity differs from the view taken of such choices in somatic care. This difference merits further investigations.

40|$|Business model {{innovation}} {{has been}} identified as vital for sustaining company performance (Zott et al., 2011). Established firms need to renew their business models in the face of changes that potentially threaten company profits (Sosna et al., 2010), as well as business model innovation is necessary to obtain the potential business value from technological innovations (Chesbrough, 2010; Teece, 2010). Despite this emphasis on the importance of innovating business models, there are few studies that focus on understanding the development of business models (Palo & Tähtinen, 2013). Moreover, due to the development towards service-based economies enabled by technology (Chesbrough, 2010), {{there is a need for}} studies focusing on how to create and capture value from data (Wamba et al., 2015). In light of these issues highlighted by scholars, the purpose of this thesis is to investigate how large, established firms conduct business model innovation for data driven services. To fulfill the purpose, the authors investigate business model innovation through activities that define and shape business model components, which is examined through research question 1. Moreover, the thesis studies how the dimensions leadership, network relations and customer involvement impact the process of developing a business model for a data driven service, which is examined through research question 2. Studying these dimensions are motivated by scholars within business model innovation (e. g. Teece, 2010), Big Data (e. g. McAfee & Brynjolfsson, 2012) and the service literature (e. g. Spohrer & Maglio, 2008). The theoretical background of this thesis builds upon the authors pre-diploma thesis (Andersen & Barkost, 2015) which, based on a literature review, created a theoretical framework for business model innovation in the context of data driven services. This theoretical framework was extended by investigating theory on leadership, network relations and customer involvement in the context of business model innovation, in this thesis. A single-embedded case study design investigating three data driven initiatives at a Norwegian-German classification society, DNV-GL, forms the basis for the analysis and discussion. The empirical findings for the thesis consists of 23 semi-structured interviews with employees from the case company, 13 of which were conducted by the authors, in addition to secondary data consisting of 10 interviews from a previous master thesis investigating one of the initiatives in this thesis (Stabursvik, 2014). Guided by the theoretical framework, the authors selected and compiled the <b>distilled</b> <b>material</b> from the empirical findings into events in time for each project. These events are analyzed separately for identification of activities and dimensions impacting the development of each service s business model. Also, the project s events are analyzed in terms of how these dimensions interrelated with one another. Finally, a cross case analysis is conducted across the three projects, addressing the research questions. It is found that business model innovation may be viewed as an activity system within events that occur in the development of an initiative. These events shape one or more business model components. Further, the analysis shows how the activity system may be affected by leadership, network relations and customer involvement, either directly in the event, or indirectly through the organizational context, as well as how these dimensions may impact one another. The discussion combines the findings on research question 1 and 2 into a process perspective consisting of phases, in addition to the considerations of business model innovation in the context of a data driven service and in a large, established firm, in order to answer the purpose. A model of the identified business model innovation process is presented in the discussion. It shows that the process of business model innovation can be viewed as a stream of relatively unrelated events consisting of one or more activities, wherein one event shapes one or more business model components. These events are scattered along the development, or change process of a data driven service, which proceeds through four phases in developing its business model. One event may impact one or more subsequent events in the BMI process, or the definition of a component can influence the definition of other business model components. The dimensions were found to primarily impact an event directly by performing or guiding business model innovation activities in that event, or the dimensions could influence an event indirectly through the organizational context. This thesis contributes to the business model innovation literature by detailing which activities can be performed during the events of developing or altering a service, that shapes its business model. It further details how this can be done, and potentially is affected by the dimensions, leadership, network relations and customer involvement, with the associated organizational context. Consequently, the thesis extends theory by proposing a model where all of this is incorporated, illustrating the coherence between elements of the overall business model innovation process through an activity-based perspective. This has not been found to be done in existing theory on business model innovation. Furthermore, this thesis describes how a business model innovation process can be analyzed. This provides insights to the gap identified by amongst others Palo & Tähtinen (2013), that there are few studies that focus on the development of business models (Sosna et al., 2010; Seidenstricker et al., 2014). The practical implications of this research is mainly relevant for management in large, established firms, but could also be interesting for other types of roles and companies, and those looking to leverage data in offerings. The proposed model can be used to generate lessons by analyzing the development of previous initiatives, eliciting the consequences on the business model of choices and actions that have been made. Management s role in initiation of the process and institutionalization of the business model has been crystallized from the analysis as crucial for the initiative s access to resources, ability to explore business model options and for overcoming barriers in the process. For digitizing companies looking to create value through brokering information, four lessons are that the value proposition may be based on creating transparency and/or incorporating multiple data sources, choice of technology may pose significant consequences for the value chain and/or value proposition, and that data access may be an issue when relying on partnerships...|$|R

The Msinga magisterial district, KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa {{is notable}} {{because it has}} for many years been {{regarded}} socially as a pariah region by residents of the Province. Over the decades {{it has been a}} 'dumping ground' for people and cultures, an infertile land where gun-running, the illegal cultivation of marijuana, and continuous stock theft has relieved some of the abject poverty, but has also exacerbated the local incidence of faction fighting. However, the people of the area have responded to this ongoing social submission by reacting with creativity and colour in their clothing, cultural goods and homesteads. The cultural material of the district is, in my opinion, unsurpassed anywhere else in the Province, from the traditional interpretation of the Msinga dolls to the exuberant architecture of the contemporary homestead. The layout and elevational resolution of any type of vernacular homestead, defined by Oliver in the first chapter, is a result of a broad number of factors, most importantly resources in terms of materials, economy, climate and culture. The response of the people of Msinga in the Tugela Valley embraces all of these factors to produce a surprising resolution that distills a fresh response to the architectural depiction of a social emergence from the peasantry. The internationally acknowledged prominent form of Zulu architecture, the beehive hut, has been adequately documented in the past. Biermann, Walton and Knuffel carried out different levels of work on this building type from the 1950 s onwards. Nowadays, dwindling natural resources in KwaZulu-Natal have resulted {{in the creation of a}} new set of vernacular architectures, responding to the environment and resources available, and reflecting the specific needs of the builders, from the expression of social and economic values, to the pragmatic reality of protection from 'political strife. On the one hand, the buildings. in the Msinga Valley are changing rapidly with the natural life course of each building. However, on the other, the development of new architectural styles with the continual building of new units within homesteads demonstrates a dynamic architectural and decorative tradition. The co-existence of the material cultures of Msinga and their architectural expression has to be documented and an attempt made at analysis. The threat of indigenous vemacular traditions disappearing at the expense of development is visible on the horizon. Regional planning initiatives are pressured to deliver houses and services on a large scale, which would be severely detrimental to the continuance of a vernacular architectural tradition. The architectural culture, although currently dynamic, is at risk, and thus begs for documentation. I aim to present the unique decorative tradition of Msinga as an architecture within the contexts of place and extant material culture. Adopting anything but a broad socio-cultural perspective in this case is both short-sighted and ill-focussed. The architecture of rural areas is a material culture that is embedded in the history, social and political struggles, and economic strife. Yet, in contrast with these negative influences, it demonstrates an exuberance that is continued in the other material cultures in Msinga. I begin with an overview, pull out the thread of Msinga as an area, then <b>distil</b> the <b>material</b> culture and, ultimately, the architecture and the decoration...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} explanatory {{power of the}} interdisciplinary New Institutional Economics theory against case studies of the events which occurred {{in the history of}} the management of the. au domain name space between 1986 and 2002. Through a series of qualitative case studies <b>distilled</b> from publicly-available <b>materials,</b> analysis of documents located in three never-before studied private archives belonging to Jon Postel, Paul Twomey and Kimberley Heitman, and a small number of interviews with key stakeholders, this dissertation tests a series of hypotheses derived from New Institutional Economics theory. Evidence was gathered which enabled the first comprehensive analysis of the path through which the right to manage the. au domain name space transitioned from the USC-ISI/Jon Postel to Robert Elz to auDA. These events are situated within a broader historical context of shifts in stakeholder perceptions of the appropriate boundary of government regulation resulting from the once-dominant cultural norm of modernism (supporting command-and-control regulation) being supplanted by post- modernism (supporting self-/co-regulation). In the context of these case studies, New Institutional Economics theory is generally found to have significant explanatory power. In particular, the theoretical concepts of the institutional environment, institutional hierarchy, stakeholder behaviour, institutional formation, institutional evolution and institutional change proved to be useful tools with which to analyse these events. However, the evidence in one case study does not support the strong form in which one claim by Oliver Williamson is currently expressed, namely that higher level institutions constrain lower level institutions. An instance where two higher-level institutions (the Australian Constitution and Regulatory Impact Assessment) did not constrain a lower-level institution is identified. The reasons why those constraints did not apply as intended are analysed and a weaker form of Williamson's claim proposed instead. A model that synthesises two concepts, institutional evolution and institutional change, into a new tool for presenting theoretical analysis, the Institutional Life-Cycle, is proposed and tested. That model is found to be effective in synthesizing the evidence found in the case studies. New Institutional Economics theory is found to offer a powerful, yet imperfect, toolset with which to undertake legal research...|$|R

Also water vapour sorption, diffusion and permeability characteristics {{of these films}} were studied. For these purposes cellulose ethers such as sodium salt of carboxymethyl cellulose (NaCMC) and hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC) were used as a film forming <b>materials.</b> <b>Distilled</b> water and glycerin were used as solvent and plasticizer respectively. To {{determine the effect of}} polymer concentration of the film forming solution on the film properties, NaCMC and HPC films were prepared from three different concentrations (3, 4, 5 g polymer/ 100 ml distilled water) of film forming solutions. During the characterization studies of the films, to determine the elements and structural composition of the films, energy dispersive X-Ray and scanning electron microscopy analyze were applied to NaCMC and HPC based edible films. Also, X-Ray diffraction, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry analysis were applied to determine the form of elements, functional groups and glass transition temperature. Water vapour sorption capacities of NaCMC and HPC based films were measured nearly 70 %w and 25 %w respectively. GAB and Halsey models were found to give the best fit for the water vapour sorption data of both NaCMC and HPC films. Diffusion coefficient of water vapour in vacuum microbalance test was higher than that determined using the humidity chamber, this case could be result of the structural changes of films such as formation of porous structure in microbalance tests due to the fast drying of films by high vacuum. NaCMC based edible films showed higher diffusion coefficient values than HPC based films, due to the heterogeneous structure and bigger pore dimensions of the NaCMC films that was observed in the scanning electron micrographs. Water vapour permeability (WVP) of both films increased with increasing thickness and increasing film forming solution concentration and WVP values of NaCMC based films were higher than the WVP values of HPC films. In mechanical properties, while NaCMC films have brittle, stronger and stiffer structure, HPC films show elastic and ductile property...|$|R
40|$|Studies {{of small}} firm growth {{are no longer}} short in supply. On the contrary, as {{demonstrated}} by recent reviews, {{dozens and dozens of}} empirical research studies on this topic can be compiled. This {{does not necessarily mean that}} we know everything we want to know about small firm growth. In fact, all of the authors of recent review articles complain that a coherent picture is not easy to <b>distil</b> from the <b>material.</b> This is likely due to differences in theoretical and epistemological perspectives and interpretations; operationalizations; empirical contexts; modelling and analysis approaches, as well as the inherent complexity of the phenomenon itself. Thus, not only a superficial but also a rather deep reading of the extant literature easily leaves the reader confused and wondering. Admitting that, we will focus in this paper on the fact that significant progress has been made and that we do actually know quite a bit now about the phenomenon of small firm growth; its antecedents and effects, and how it can or should be studied. It is not possible within the confines of a conference paper—and possibly outside the capacity of these authors—to give a complete account of that knowledge. What we will attempt is a summary of points of convergence within some key themes. We first discuss the nature of the phenomenon of small firm growth and its relation to entrepreneurship. Here we discuss the fact that the concept ‘growth’ is used both for ‘change in amount’ and for the process that leads to that change. We also note that part of the reason for lack of coherence in previous research is the heterogeneous nature of growth; firms can expand along different dimensions and show many different growth patterns over time. As regards the relationship between growth and entrepreneurship we conclude that at least early growth of new ventures is part of the entrepreneurship phenomenon. We then move on to how growth can best be assessed. This involves decisions about number of time periods; choice of specific indicator(s) and growth formulae, and the like. We conclude that ideally, growth should be assessed as size changes over multiple periods, preferably in a concurrent, longitudinal design. While sales growth is the most generally applicable measure, theoretical and industry-specific concerns should also influence the choice of indicator(s). A major section is devoted to the long list of internal and external factors that have been hypothesized and shown to influence firm growth. It is probably the case that every theoretically reasonable suggestion for a growth determinant has been shown to have the predicted impact in some context. We argue that the problem is to develop better knowledge about the relative and combined effects of the many predictors under different circumstances. One way to deal with this problem is to increase the level of abstraction and regard the many particularities as aspects of more over-riding factors, some of which influence growth directly while others only have an indirect impact. Another is to give up ambitions of approaching full explanation but instead enhance our understanding of the interplay among a smaller set of specific factors. A third is to limit the study to a more homogenous empirical context and generalize only to that context until replications have shown broader generalization is warranted. We then turn to how small firms grow, if at all. This concerns issues of organic vs. acquisition-based growth; internationalisation; integration; diversification, etc. One striking result here is the very marked difference between young and small vs. large and mature growing firms in that the former mainly grow organically while the latter achieve the bulk of their growth through acquisitions. This has some overlap with the next topic, which is ‘growth stages and transitions’, but as the latter is a relatively separate stream in the literature we keep it as such. We note that the critique of this literature seems to have led not to better research but to no research at all in this stream more recently. This is unfortunate because it represents the type of knowledge small firm managers typically need and demand. Before concluding, we also treat the relationship between growth and profitability. Surprisingly few studies have investigated this crucial relationship. Recent findings indicate that firms that grow successfully do so by first securing profitability, and then go for growth. This is strong reason to caution against a universal and uncritical growth ideology. As it appears, firms that grow at low profitability often end up in the undesirable state of low growth and low profits instead. This also puts small-firm managers’ widespread reluctance to pursue growth in a different light. Finally, we conclude the paper with a summary of what our review implies for the design of further studies on small firm growth...|$|R
