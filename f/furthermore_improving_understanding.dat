40|$|Phytoplankton {{forms the}} base of the marine food web, but when {{concentrations}} get too high, algal blooms can have adverse effects on ecosystems and aquaculture. Phytoplankton concentrations vary strongly in space and time. However, the nature and drivers of this variability are not yet well understood. For ecological assessments and for early warnings of harmful algal blooms, monitoring strategies are required with sufficiently high temporal and spatial resolution to capture the natural variability of phytoplankton. Novel monitoring methods, such as satellite remote sensing and automated moorings, can acquire information on phytoplankton abundance at a high resolution in space and time. In this thesis, high-resolution data sets from the North Sea are used to investigate phytoplankton variability at different time scales and to identify the mechanisms driving phytoplankton variability. We applied a range of statistical and modelling approaches to analyse data from various traditional and novel monitoring techniques. In this way we demonstrate the potential power of these novel techniques and gained a much <b>improved</b> <b>understanding</b> of phytoplankton variability. Based on this understanding appropriate monitoring strategies can be designed to assess the response of phytoplankton to changes in nutrient inputs and climate change. <b>Furthermore,</b> the <b>improved</b> <b>understanding</b> of drivers of phytoplankton variability supports the set-up and validation of ecological models to predict harmful algal blooms and the productivity of marine ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Architectural Engineering and Construction SciencesKimberly Waggle KramerBill ZhangCold-formed steel members quickly are {{becoming}} a popular material for both commercial and residential construction around the world. Their high strength to weight ratio makes them {{a viable alternative to}} timber framing. In most cases cold-formed steel is used as a repetitive member in floor, wall, or roof assemblies. Structural sheathing is used in conjunction with the framing members in order to transfer loads between individual members. This sheathing is connected mechanically to the cold-formed steel through a variety of methods. The most common method uses screws spaced at close intervals, usually between 6 to 12 inches on center. When such assemblies are constructed, load is transferred from the sheathing through the connectors into the cold-formed steel, forming a composite assembly in which load is transferred and shared between two materials, providing a higher strength and stiffness over individual members themselves. The amount of load that can be transferred is dependent on the amount of slip that occurs when the assembly is loaded. This slip value describes the amount of composite action that takes place in the assembly. The amount of slip can be described by a value called the slip modulus. The composite, or effective, bending stiffness can be calculated using the slip modulus. In current design of cold-formed steel composite assemblies this composite action is not being taken into account {{due to a lack of}} research and understanding of the composite stiffness present in these assemblies. Taking composite action into account can lead to decreased member sizes or increased spacing of members, thereby economizing design. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>improved</b> <b>understanding</b> of the effective stiffness can lead to more accurate design for vibrations in floor systems. This thesis tests cold-formed steel plywood composite members in an effort to verify previously established slip modulus values for varying steel thicknesses and establishes new values for varying fastener spacings. The slip modulus values obtained are used to calculate effective bending stiffness values in an effort to prove that composite action should be utilized in design of cold-formed steel composite assemblies...|$|R

Re-utilisation of conventional wastes such as different grades of polymeric particulates derived from municipal wastes is being explored as a partial replacement of natural aggregates in making concretes. This poses new challenges to researchers as methods to evaluate the effects of new host particles on the mechanical strength characteristics of composite concretes at microscale and their subsequent effects on their bulk strength are not yet well established. In this research work, municipal polymeric wastes in various forms and fly ash from incineration of municipal solid wastes are used together as secondary raw materials for the preparation of concrete mixtures. The influence of various forms of polyethylene (PE) substitution on the local and global shear stress distribution are sensed whole-field on the cylindrical and notched concrete beams using the principles of photonics. The generic methodology reported here would be of great interest in measuring the strength of concretes and other cementitious composite materials under different loading environments in future. <b>Furthermore,</b> an <b>improved</b> <b>understanding</b> on both microscale stress (/strain) evolution and macro strength characteristics could form a basis to develop new strength theories of composite concretes...|$|R
40|$|Plants often {{experience}} various biotic and abiotic stresses {{during their}} life cycle. The abiotic stresses include mainly drought, salt, temperature (low/high), flooding and nutritional deficiency/excess which hamper crop growth and yield {{to a great}} extent. In view of a projection 50 % of the crop loss is attributable to abiotic stresses. However, abiotic stresses cause a myriad of changes in physiological, molecular and biochemical processes operating in plants. It is now widely reported that several proteins respond to these stresses at pre- and post-transcriptional and translational levels. By knowing the role of these stress inducible proteins, {{it would be easy}} to comprehensively expound the processes of stress tolerance in plants. The proteomics study offers a new approach to discover proteins and pathways associated with crop physiological and stress responses. Thus, studying the plants at proteomic levels could help understand the pathways involved in stress tolerance. <b>Furthermore,</b> <b>improving</b> the <b>understanding</b> of the identified key metabolic proteins involved in tolerance can be implemented into biotechnological applications, regarding recombinant/transgenic formation. Additionally, the investigation of identified metabolic processes ultimately supports the development of antistress strategies.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the impact of}} illiquidity and liquidity risk on expected stock returns in the Turkish stock markets. Using daily data of the ISE- 100 stock index from 2005 to 2012 and Amihud (2002) illiquidity measure, we test the liquidity-adjusted capital asset pricing model (L-CAPM) of Acharya and Pedersen (2005). Performing cross-sectional regression tests across test portfolios, we find supporting evidence that illiquidity is significantly and positively priced. Specifically, our results indicate that liquidity risk arising from the commonality in liquidity {{is the most important}} component of liquidity risk. The strong interrelationship between the market liquidity and the liquidity of individual stocks suggests that market-wide shocks on the Istanbul Stock Exchange might quickly affect every stock in this market. Hence, liquidity commonality might create a systemic risk in which case liquidity shocks can be perfectly correlated across all stocks. Our study is the first to investigate stock liquidity-return relationship at daily frequency and to apply the L-CAPM on the Turkish stock markets. Our findings provide interesting conclusions for investors, risk managers and regulators in emerging economies, and in particular, Turkey. Investors should incorporate liquidity risk into their trading and hedging strategies to improve their risk profile and increase their investment returns. <b>Furthermore,</b> an <b>improved</b> <b>understanding</b> of systemic liquidity is vital for regulatory authorities to design improved regulations against systemic shocks. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{more and}} more local governments begin to {{understand}} that the great promises of e-service delivery are harder than expected to realize, efficient use of ICT-resources have become increasingly important. Since simply providing more e-services is not the solution, the need to understand what constitutes a suitable e-service has arisen. Public services reach beyond the market domain; therefore, the complexities of public value must be dealt with when services are appraised. Furthermore, due to the heterogeneous nature of local government services it is impossible to evaluate all the options in depth; thus, there is a clear need for early-stage appraisal. However, existing methods of appraisal are burdened by intricacy, and associated with high costs. In response, this paper presents a model capable of reducing this intricacy. The model was developed through a participatory design process involving members on both operational and strategic level in the municipality of Skellefteå. The model implements state of the art into the workspace context while taking measures to reduce intricacy such as: incremental filtering, moving high intricacy elements {{to the end of the}} process, and exploitation of available data. As a result the organization is enabled to capture not only the low hanging fruit, but also the long tail of services. <b>Furthermore,</b> the <b>improved</b> <b>understanding</b> of e-service delivery has the potential to open up opportunities for new ways of business development and private-public partnerships.

The aim {{of this investigation was}} to find out how the discretisation level affects quality of modelling with the hydrological modelling system J 2000. <b>Furthermore</b> we <b>improved</b> our <b>understanding</b> of the applicability and reliability of the distributed model J 2000 on the macro-scale. Spatial information was aggregated in two different discretisation levels: subbasins (SB) and hydrological response polygons (HRP). A J 2000 simulation was carried out for both discretisation levels based on a 1 year calibration and a 3 year validation period. Simulations performed well for both levels of spatial discretisation. The results seemed to be better in the more complex discretisation approach, where the Nash-Sutcliffe coefficient was higher. We can conclude that our first results show more accurate simulations produced by the HRP discretisation approach, the visual inspection shows a better application of the SB approach to the reproduction of the base flow. ...|$|R
40|$|Living in large, stable {{groups is}} often {{considered}} to favour {{the evolution of}} cognitive abilities related to social living, {{such as the ability}} to track relationships among group members and to make transitive inferences about relationships based on indirect evidence. Greylag geese are relatively small brained, but live in complex societies with social support and clan structures. They form dominance hierarchies in which families dominate pairs and unpaired individuals. However, competition is costly and the ability to transitively infer relationships among flock members may be highly advantageous. We tested five free-living, juvenile greylag geese embedded in a flock of 150 birds for their ability to track multiple dyadic relationships and their transitive inference competence. Individuals were trained on discriminations between successive pairs of five implicitly ordered colours (A–E). All individuals learned to track four dyadic relationships simultaneously and showed transitive inference when presented with nonadjacent colours. Remarkably, the amount of training required was related to the individual’s early social environment. Our study {{is one of the first}} to show transitive inference in a precocial bird and suggests an influence of early social experience on sociocognitive abilities. <b>Furthermore,</b> it <b>improves</b> our <b>understanding</b> of social complexity as an important selection pressure for the evolution of cognition...|$|R

I will present an understanding rather than an explanation on how second language adult students learn maths. It can be argued that people who study maths as adults in a new homeland and in a foreign language face particular challenges. At the same time research reports that people sometimes approach the subject in a more fruitful way as adults compared to their childhood experiences. I want to contribute to the general knowledge of the subject and <b>furthermore</b> provide <b>improved</b> <b>understanding</b> of how mathematics teachers can guide their students towards their goals. I have performed semi-structured qualitative research interviews. My informants are my own maths students on the basic level with incomplete grades in maths from secondary school, or they have failed in their maths studies in upper secondary school due to a low level of know-ledge. They are over 20 years of age and they are all immigrants and have arrived in Sweden as adults. I have used my students statements, written as narratives as the material which is to be interpreted and understood. Because of my use of my own students in the interview, I will not take into account their statements about the teacher’s role in my conclusion. I find that: 1. The difficult experience of being forced to leave the home country, together with a wish to take revenge on the failures from their youth, can lead to a kind of struggle for decom-pensation that can be reflected in the participants' positive evaluation of their maths studies. 2. Having a family is a great motivational help for studying regardless of the time it takes to take care of the same. 3. The memories of previous failures with the incomprehensible, abstract mathematics characterise the students’ inception of the subject. 4.

40|$|The {{cattle tick}} Rhipicephalus microplus is a hematophagous {{ectoparasite}} of major veterinary importance both globally and in Australia. Australian beef cattle {{producers in the}} tropical and subtropical regions of the continent suffer estimated annual losses of AU$ 175 m. The development of a novel tick vaccine has therefore {{been identified as a}} high priority research goal by all stakeholders of the Australian beef industry (Playford 2005). A novel bioinformatics methodology for the identification of potential vaccine targets in the R. microplus expressed sequence tags sequences was developed and applied resulting in the identification of 68 potential tick vaccine candidates. Furthermore, the applicability of RNA interference (RNAi) for tick gene functional studies was assessed. This study comprehensively characterized the major components of the RNAi pathway in both R. microplus and Ixodes scapularis, which resulted in the identification of an I. scapularis homologue of Dicer protein, as well as the identification of Argonaute- 1 and - 2 homologues in both I. scapularis and R. microplus. Most notably, homologues of a C. elegans RNA-dependent RNA polymerase were found in both R. microplus and I. scapularis, a protein involved in the amplification of the RNAi signal and previously not identified in any other arthropod species. A comparative RNAi study targeting 10 highly conserved R. microplus homologues of Drosophila genes with known RNAi phenotypes was conducted. The R. microplus homologue of D. melanogaster Ubiquitin- 63 E showed the strongest phenotypic changes in both cell culture and in adult female ticks injected with dsRNA. This Ubiquitin- 63 Esilencing effect in fully engorged females was subsequently investigated by microarray analysis. The contribution of potential off-target effects to phenotypic changes was assessed by developing an in silico analysis and combining the prediction results with the microarray data. A total of 224 unique transcripts were detected as differentially expressed. The off-target analysis revealed that 11 off-targets predicted by the in silico analysis were present in the list of differentially expressed genes. The research presented in this thesis has contributed to the development of novel approaches for reverse vaccinology in ectoparasites and it has <b>furthermore</b> <b>improved</b> the <b>understanding</b> of the mechanisms of RNAi and the delivery of double-stranded RNA in ticks...|$|R
40|$|Post-traumatic stress {{disorder}} (PTSD) {{is classified as}} an anxiety disorder in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV of the American Psychiatric Association. It is characterised by three main symptom clusters: re-experiencing (of which flashbacks are the hallmark symptom); hyperarousal; and avoidance. Diagnosis requires not only the occurrence of a traumatic event but also an intense emotional (fear, horror, or helplessness) reaction to it. Epidemiological data suggest that 80 % of people will experience at least one qualifying event in their lifetime. However, prevalence rates of PTSD are much lower. Additionally, individuals with PTSD tend to experience flashbacks of {{only two or three}} particular ‘hot-spots’ of the entire trauma. Therefore, the question arises: why do some moments of trauma flash back and not others? Clinical-cognitive theories of PTSD suggest that shifts in information processing {{at the time of the}} trauma (i. e. peri-traumatically) are the mechanism whereby flashbacks are created. However, for ethical and practical reasons peri-traumatic processes in real trauma are seldom studied. An analogue traumatic event has been developed to help study peri-traumatic processes – the trauma film paradigm. This paradigm is used through-out this thesis with the goal of investigating peri-traumatic cognitive mechanisms in flashback formation. Studies 1 and 2 extend previous work using dual tasks to manipulate intrusions in-line with clinical-cognitive theories. Studies 3 and 4 use neuroimaging techniques to investigate brain regions involved in real-time peri-traumatic encoding of analogue flashbacks. Chapter 9 presents heart rate data relating to peri-traumatic physiological response to flashback encoding. All of these studies support the notion that peri-traumatic shifts in processing are involved in flashback formation. In particular, Study 3 suggests that there may be a particular neural signature associated with the formation of flashbacks. Investigation of these brain areas may help solve the questions of why some individuals are more vulnerable to PTSD and why only a few specific moments of a trauma subsequently flashback. <b>Furthermore,</b> an <b>improved</b> <b>understanding</b> of the cognitive mechanisms involved in flashback formation may allow theory and evidence led improvements in PTSD treatments.

40|$|Linking {{variation}} in ecosystem functioning to landscape drivers {{has become an}} important research need for understanding ecosystem responses to global change. Due to extensive land use and land cover changes many regions have variable distributions of landscape drivers and ecosystem processes. Furthermore, changes in local- to regional-scale climate may impact ecosystem variation and sensitivity to physiological drivers. This dissertation investigates how contrasting scale-dependent drivers of soil temperature, moisture and substrate levels influence soil respiration (Rs), a key ecosystem process, using in-situ landscape surveys and experimental subsidies of water and labile carbon. <b>Furthermore,</b> to <b>improve</b> <b>understanding</b> of scale-dependent sources of variation of urban microclimate this dissertation investigates how land cover and vegetation influences local distributions of air temperature (Ta), land surface temperature (LST), and relative humidity (RH), using intensive and widely distributed networks of microclimate sensors. Finally, vital in estimates of urban warming, this dissertation examines the relationships between Ta and LST among common urban land covers. 	I found Rs in intensively managed urban land uses has increased rates, decreased spatial variation, and decreased sensitivity to environmental conditions. Furthermore, among common urban land uses spatial {{variation in}} Rs {{was positively correlated with}} soil temperature, and negatively correlated with soil moisture and substrate. Landscape position, or land use and climate distributions, influenced Rs by altering both levels and Rs sensitivity of physiological drivers. Next, in my first microclimate study I found negative Ta and positive RH correlations with vegetation intensity. Vegetation cooling effects were greater in more arid climates and in the evening hours. Furthermore, increasing city-scale mean Ta was associated with higher spatial variation of Ta in coastal cities, and lower variation in more arid cities. In my final study I observed vertical height-dependent Ta-LST relationships associated with land cover composition. Furthermore, I observed decreased nighttime Ta-LST differences among land covers. These findings can help city planners identify potential heat risk reductions strategies associated with urban vegetation and land cover composition. Together, these systematic evaluations of landscape effects on Rs and microclimate provide a framework of understanding the effects of interactive global change drivers on urban ecosystem processes...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{regulation}} of chromatin structure {{is controlled by}} a family of molecular motors called chromatin remodelers. The ability of these enzymes to remodel chromatin structure is dependent {{on their ability to}} couple ATP binding and hydrolysis into the mechanical work that drives nucleosome repositioning. The necessary first step in determining how these essential enzymes perform this function is to characterize both how they bind nucleosomes and how this interaction is regulated by ATP binding and hydrolysis. With this goal in mind, we monitored the interaction of the chromatin remodeler ISWI with fluorophore-labeled nucleosomes and DNA through associated changes in fluorescence anisotropy of the fluorophore upon binding of ISWI to these substrates. We determined that one ISWI molecule binds to a 20 bp double-stranded DNA substrate with an affinity of 18 ± 2 nM. In contrast, two ISWI molecules can bind to the core nucleosome with short linker DNA with stoichiometric macroscopic equilibrium constants: 1 /β 1 = 1. 3 ± 0. 6 nM, and 1 /β 2 = 13 ± 7 nM 2. <b>Furthermore,</b> to <b>improve</b> our <b>understanding</b> of the mechanism of DNA translocation by ISWI, and hence nucleosome repositioning, we determined the effect of nucleotide analogues on substrate binding by ISWI.
