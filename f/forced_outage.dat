40|$|This report {{documents}} the model development {{carried out in}} work package 3 in the SUPWIND project. It was decided {{to focus on the}} estimation of the need for reserve power, and on the reservation of reserve power by TSOs. Reserve power is needed to cover deviations from the day-ahead forecasts of electricity load and wind power production, and to cover <b>forced</b> <b>outages</b> of power plants and transmission lines. Work has been carried out to include load uncertainty and <b>forced</b> <b>outages</b> in the two main components of the Wilmar Planning tool namely the Scenario Tree Tool and the Joint Market Model. This work is documented in chapter 1 and 2. The inclusion of load uncertainty and <b>forced</b> <b>outages</b> in the Scenario Tree Tool enables calculation of the demand for reserve power depending on the forecast horizon. The algorithm is given in Section 3. 1. The design of {{a modified version of the}} Joint Market Model enabling estimation of th...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic programming (DP) model {{of an electric}} utility's optimal policy for operating {{a nuclear power plant}} (NPP). The utility chooses the level of capacity utilization of the NPP as a function of signals about the NPP's current operating state. In each period the utility must determine whether or not to operate the reactor, or shut it down for preventive maintenance or refueling, or to permanently close the plant. Maintenance performed during periodic refueling outages partially ``regenerates'' the NPP, reducing the risk of unplanned <b>forced</b> <b>outages</b> in succeeding periods. Using monthly data on U. S. NPPs in the post-TMI era we estimate parameters of the utility's profit function, the failure processes that lead to unplanned <b>forced</b> <b>outages,</b> and the parameters governing the duration of refueling outages. These parameters imply an endogenous distribution of operating spells and capacity utilization levels that depend on the NPP's age, signals the operator receives about the NPP's current operating state, and the duration since last refueling. The estimates of the DP model reveal that utilities appear responsive to NRC regulation insofar as they impute a very high cost to unplanned and <b>forced</b> <b>outages.</b> Utilities are also highly averse to causing unnecessary wear and tear on their NPP's caused by stop/start operation of their NPP's including planned and unplanned outages. Overall, the DP model yields very accurate predictions of nuclear power generation including the impact of the relatively rare event of NPP decommissionings. ...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} data {{comparing the}} performance of light water reactors in the United States and the Federal Republic of Germany (FRG). The comparisons are made for the years 1980 - 1983 and include 21 Westinghouse Pressurized Water Reactors (PWRs), 22 General Electric Boiling Water Reactors (BWRs) in the US; and 6 Kraftwerk Union (KWU) PWRs and 4 KWU BWRs in the FRG. Data on capacity losses are presented in a disaggregated form for scheduled <b>outages,</b> <b>forced</b> <b>outages,</b> and regulatory imposed outages. Further, within the scheduled and <b>forced</b> <b>outages,</b> the data is subdivided into losses associated with the nuclear island, the balance of plant, or other causes. The report also surveys a number of observations relating to the causes of discrepancies between the US and West Germany. These observations were obtained from interviews with executives and engineers in both nations, including people from vendors, utilities, regulators, and architect/engineers. These discussions are distilled into observations relating to national differences in the broad areas of economics and economic regulation, safety regulations, and technical and managerial differences...|$|R

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of {{electricity}} sector restructuring on the operating efficiency of coal-fired power plants in India. Between 1995 and 2009, 85 percent of coal-based generation capacity owned by state governments was unbundled from vertically integrated State Electricity Boards into state generating companies. We find that generating units in states that unbundled before the Electricity Act of 2003 experienced reductions in <b>forced</b> <b>outages</b> of about 25 % and improvements in availability of about 10 %, with the largest results occurring 3 - 5 years after restructuring. We find no evidence of improvements in thermal efficiency at state-owned power plants due to reform. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to analyse radial {{networks}} in rural areas for the deployment of mobile generators that maintain electricity supply {{in the event of}} a <b>forced</b> <b>outage.</b> Maintaining the electricity supply in such a situation would minimise <b>forced</b> <b>outage</b> compensation costs a network operator has to pay after 12 hours of <b>forced</b> <b>outage.</b> The deployment of mobile generators will offer an important option in guaranteeing that both forced and planned outages in underground cable networks do not take longer than 24 hours. Through analyses of two case studies of radial networks, I have developed reference charts so that mobile generators can be quickly deployed and power supply returned within 12 hours. The mobile generators are to be connected to substations to feed other substations in the radial network through medium voltage cables. Only voltage drop and loadability have been considered in this study. The methodology I used for creating the reference charts can be applied to other radial networks and extended to include other limitations in the application of mobile generators.

40|$|To {{simulate}} the economic {{operation of a}} Power System, production costing models utilize the multi-block representation of the conventional units. Each capacity block of a conventional thermal unit is described by a two-state reliability model. In this paper a reliability model for combined cycle units is proposed. With the model proposed a combined cycle unit consisting of N gas turbines and a steam generator can be represented by N blocks, each of which corresponds to the various operating levels of the unit. For each operating block a multi-state reliability model is proposed, {{in order to take}} into account the partial failures of the unit when required to operate at that level, taking into consideration the <b>forced</b> <b>outage</b> rates of the gas turbines and the <b>forced</b> <b>outage</b> rate of the steam generator. © 2003 IEEE...|$|E
30|$|In this paper, load {{forecast}} errors, gas prices, IBDR bid prices, and system component <b>forced</b> <b>outage</b> rates (FORs) are considered as uncertainties. Monte Carlo (MC) simulations {{are used to}} generate scenarios based on the probability density functions (PDFs) of uncertainties. Furthermore, {{load forecast}} errors, gas prices and IBDR bid prices are modelled by the Gaussian distribution [29]. <b>Forced</b> <b>outage</b> rates are modelled by the Binomial distribution [30]. The mathematical formulations of these PDFs are common in the literature {{and they are not}} given in detail here. For example, a scenario can be: “for t =  1, IBDR bid price is $ 70 /MWh, load level is 2000 MW, gas price is $ 8 /GJ, and all components are available.” The convergence criterion of MC simulations is that the ratio of the standard deviation against the expected value is smaller than a pre-defined threshold.|$|E
40|$|Twenty-first century power systems, {{with higher}} {{penetration}} levels of low-carbon energy, smart grids, and other emerging technologies, will favor resources that have low marginal costs and provide system flexibility (e. g., {{the ability to}} cycle on and off to follow changes in variable renewable energy plant output). Questions remain about both the fate of coal plants in this scenario and whether they can cost-effectively continue to operate if they cycle routinely. The experience from the CGS plant demonstrates that coal plants can become flexible resources. This flexibility - namely the ability to cycle on and off and run at lower output (below 40 % of capacity) - requires limited hardware modifications but extensive modifications to operational practice. Cycling does damage the plant and impact its life expectancy compared to baseload operations. Nevertheless, strategic modifications, proactive inspections and training programs, among other operational changes to accommodate cycling, can minimize the extent of damage and optimize the cost of maintenance. CGS's cycling, but not necessarily the associated price tag, is replicable. Context - namely, power market opportunities and composition of the generation fleet - will help determine for other coal plants the optimal balance between the level of cycling-related <b>forced</b> <b>outages</b> {{and the level of}} capital investment required to minimize those outages. Replicating CGS's experience elsewhere will likely require a higher acceptance of <b>forced</b> <b>outages</b> than regulators and plant operators are accustomed to; however, an increase in strategic maintenance can minimize the impact on outage rates...|$|R
