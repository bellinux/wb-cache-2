40|$|Problem statement: The {{extraction}} hoods {{commonly used}} as <b>inlet</b> <b>element</b> {{of the local}} ventilation systems exhibit limited emission capture over moderate distances from {{the source of the}} hazardous emissions. Proposed inclusion of a swirling peripheral jet was found to increase the effective length over which the extraction hood successfully captures harmful fumes. However information on a detailed pattern field of the vortex focused inflow was insufficient thus restricting the potential applications of the method. Approach: The numerical modeling study of the focusing by vortex inflow was accomplished to reveal the implication of the key operating parameters. In addition the visualization technique was applied to confirm the fume capturing features. Results: The simulated overall flow field patterns for an inflow of 10 m sec - 1 value under sets of 0. 5 - 1. 5 swirl numbers and 0 - 21 m sec - 1 outcome velocities of peripheral jet showed the arrangement and contour of the capture stream. Under optimum parameters the capture zone derived from the vector velocity field yielded up to 4 inlet diameters near-axis distance from the extractor entrance. The complimentary observations using laser sheet visualization technique confirmed the enhanced capturing capacity from the mist or smoke sources of emission. Conclusion: Through numerical modeling study the capacity of peripheral vortex shielding to generate the more concentrated exhaust inflow comparing with action of the conventional hood has been elucidated...|$|E

40|$|The study {{focuses on}} the impact of human {{interventions}} on the natural behaviour of estuaries in response to sea-level rise. In particular it {{focuses on the}} affect of managed realignment on the critical sea level rise (SLRcrit) for the Poole Harbour. Numerical model ASMITA (Aggregated Scale Morphological Interaction between a Tidal inlet and the Adjacent coast, Stive and Wang, 1996) is used to study the response of the system to the external forcing (both natural and anthropogenic). ASMITA model schematises the tidal-inlet system and characterises each model element by a single variable volume. Volumetric data of the Poole harbour <b>inlet</b> <b>elements</b> obtained through the digitisation of the historical admiralty charts was used to calibrate the model. The model assumes that the each <b>inlet</b> <b>elements</b> tends towards an equilibrium volume which can be defined using the empirical equations. These equilibrium equations consist of equilibrium parameters that depend on the regional properties like hydrodynamics and topography of the Poole harbour. Once the model is calibrated, simulations were performed with various sea level rise scenarios (historic and future SLR) to observe the natural behaviour of the Poole harbour. Managed realignment is being introduced in the model and a range of values of critical sea-level rise was obtained and compared with the predicted sea-level rise rate given in the literature for the next century. Results suggest that the “hold the line” management scenario (current situation) would not result in the complete loss of inter-tidal flats and the coastal flooding is unlikely to occur over the next century, as a result of critical sea-level rise values exceeds the predicted rate. However research suggests, introducing realignment (coastline retreat management scenario) reduces SLRcrit values for the estuary; thus making the estuary more sensitive to the predicted future SLR rates.

40|$|Abstract: In Hungary, the prevalently used “B 11 ” type gas {{appliances}} equipped with atmospheric burner {{and they have}} a draught hood beyond the outlet of the appliance. For the appropriate adjustment of the gas boiler to the conditions of the building, computer-generated calculation results have to be obtained which can help the positioning of the appliance and the air supply outlets in the room in which the appliance is installed. Chimneys of natural draught are very sensitive to the changes in the amount of combustion air due to inside or outside ambient phenomena or forced effects. For the purposes of modelling, a numerical simulation (CFD method) can be used. The aim of numeric modelling is to investigate velocity and temperature conditions around the flue gas outlet and in the room and, subsequently, to define design approaches and the requirements for different conditions. The conclusion of our investigations is that the air supply of the room can be accomplished with correctly sized air outlets and <b>inlet</b> <b>elements...</b>|$|R
40|$|De-icing of {{aircraft}} {{by using the}} electro-magnetic impulse phenomenon was proposed and demonstrated in several European countries. However, it is not available as a developed system {{due to lack of}} research on the basic physical mechanisms and necessary design parameters. The de-icing is accomplished by rapidly discharging high voltage capacitors into a wire coil rigidly supported just inside the aircraft skin. Induced eddy currents in the skin create a repulsive force resulting in a hammer-like force which cracks, de-bonds, and expels ice on the skin surface. The promised advantages are very low energy, high reliability of de-icing, and low maintenance. Three years of Electo-Impulse De-icing (EIDI) research is summarized and the analytical studies and results of testing done in the laboratory, in the NASA Icing Research Tunnel, and in flight are presented.

40|$|Case StudyAir Compressor Site Performance Testing: Apparent Simplicity and Practical Complexity: The {{performance}} of a steam turbine driven air compressor deteriorated by 35 % over a span of four months. This Case Study elaborates on the identification, analysis and restoration of performance. Compressor Rating: Casings: 2 with intercooler. Capacity: 19, 497 Inlet m 3 /hr [11, 476 ICFM]. Speed: 8400 rpm. Rated mass flow: 21, 585 Kg/hr [793 lb/min]. Power: 2. 3 MW. Discharge pressure: 10. 6 bara. [152. 3 Psia]. The subject air compressor forms part of the utility and instrumentation air supply system to an oil refinery. Constant pressure at header that supplies air to instrumentation system is very important. Any reduction in mass flow of dry air to the air supply system will result in reduction of the header pressure. Drop in air header pressure was experienced that prompted potential deterioration in air compressor performance. Performance testing at site indicated operating points almost on the design surge curve. The difference between the design polytrophic efficiency and the polytrophic efficiency calculated from data collected during operation at comparable operating points {{for the first and}} second casings were marginal, 0. 3 to 0. 7 percent.

The soils of Venice Lagoon are characterized by very erratic depositional patterns of clayey silts, resulting in an extremely heterogeneous stratigraphy with discontinuous layering. The soils are also characterized by varying contents of coarse and fine-grained particles. In contrast, the mineralogical composition of these deposits is quite uniform, which allows us to separate the influence of mineralogy from that of grain size distribution. A comprehensive geotechnical testing program was performed to assess the one-dimensional compression of Venice soils and examine the factors affecting the response in the transition from one material type to another.

40|$|Automatic FAG 62 I-N beta-dust {{monitors}} {{have been}} used in the National Air Quality Monitoring Network to measure PM 10 (particles smaller than 10 um aerodynamic diameter) in the Netherlands. In comparing the 5 -method with the European reference method (EN 12341) for PM 10, this automatic beta-method was found to underestimate the PM 10 levels observed using the reference method by about 25 %. Laboratory research was then carried out to explore the causes. These laboratory experiments focussed on the influence of moisture on the response of the monitor, and on the influence of the inlet heating on both the volatile ammonium nitrate aerosol and the less volatile ammonium sulphate aerosol. Humidity will only slightly increase the concentrations measured by the beta-dust monitor. At very high humidities (RH over 80 %), positive offsetting (overestimation) of the dust concentration of up to about 3 - 4 ug/m 3 was observed when compared to the reference method. Thus humidity can not explain the aforementioned difference of 25 % at commonly encountered PM 10 levels. The inlet heating of the beta-dust monitor definitively does evaporate volatile ammonium nitrate aerosol. At the maximum set temperature (80 degrees Celcius) of the <b>inlet</b> heating <b>element</b> of the FAG 62 I-N beta-dust monitor, ammonium nitrate will be completely evaporated, and so no ammonium nitrate is measured. At the standard setting of 50 degrees Celcius the ammonium nitrate will partly evaporate, i. e. only part of the ammonium nitrate is measured. In contrast, the TEOM (Tapered Element Oscillation Microbalance) evaporates all the ammonium nitrate. The heating efficiencies of the monitors are clearly different. For this reason they can not be compared when volatile aerosol is present. The less volatile ammonium sulphate aerosol does not experience any influence of inlet heating, so the methods of measurement are comparable in this case...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} achieve high heat removal rates for micro scale cooling, it may be {{necessary}} to exploit boiling heat transfer. The size of corresponding heat sinks is continuously decreasing from mini size to micro size, and one of the most practical and extensive cooling methods is boiling heat transfer in plain microchannels and microtubes, which might be limited by inherent boiling instabilities. This study provides useful information about boiling instability phenomena in microtubes and offers a parametric comparative investigation. Experimental data are obtained from microtubes having 254 ∼μm and 685 ∼ μm inner diameters, which were tested at low mass fluxes (78. 9 - 276. 3 kg/m 2 s) to reveal potential boiling instability mechanisms. De-ionized water was used as working fluid, while microtubes were heated by Joule heating. Configurations prone to boiling instabilities (low system pressures, low mass fluxes) were imposed to observe boiling instabilities in microtubes. Fine restriction valves were introduced to the system for providing flow restriction at the inlet. Alongside the experiments without any inlet restriction, experiments were conducted with configurations having inlet restrictions, where pressure drops over <b>inlet</b> restriction <b>elements</b> were 4 and 8 times as much as pressure drop over the microtube to suppress boiling instabilities. Temperature and pressure drop fluctuation signals were recorded and processed before premature CHF (Critical Heat Flux) conditions and at impending premature CHF conditions.

It derives the equations for the rotor scattering coefficients and stator source vector and scattering coefficients {{that are needed}} {{for use in the}} TFANS (Theoretical Fan Noise Design/Prediction System). SOURCE 3 D treats the rotor and stator as isolated source elements. TFANS uses this information, along with scattering coefficients for <b>inlet</b> and exit <b>elements,</b> and provides complete noise solutions for turbofan engines. SOURCE 3 D is composed of a collection of FORTRAN programs that have been obtained by extending the approach of the earlier V 072 Rotor Wake/Stator Interaction Code. Similar to V 072, it treats the rotor and stator as a collection of blades and vanes having zero thickness and camber contained in an infinite, hardwall annular duct. SOURCE 3 D adds important features to the V 072 capability-a rotor element, swirl flow and vorticity waves, actuator disks for flow turning, and combined rotor/actuator disk and stator/actuator disk elements. These items allow reflections from the rotor, frequency scattering, and mode trapping, thus providing more complete noise predictions than previously.

40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that total head losses in a sand filter are solely {{due to the}} {{filtration}} media {{and that there are}} analytical solutions, such as the Ergun equation, to compute them. However, total head losses are also due to auxiliary <b>elements</b> (<b>inlet</b> and outlet pipes and filter nozzles), which produce undesirable head losses because they increase energy requirements without contributing to the filtration process. In this study, ANSYS Fluent version 6. 3, a commercial computational fluid dynamics (CFD) software program, was used to compute head losses in different parts of a sand filter. Six different numerical filter models of varying complexities were used to understand the hydraulic behavior of the several filter elements and their importance in total head losses. The simulation results show that 84. 6 % of these were caused by the sand bed and 15. 4 % were due to auxiliary elements (4. 4 % in the outlet and inlet pipes, and 11. 0 % in the perforated plate and nozzles). Simulation results with different models show the important role of the nozzles in the hydraulic behavior of the sand filter. The relationship between the passing area through the nozzles and the passing area through the perforated plate is an important design parameter for the reduction of total head losses. A reduced relationship caused by nozzle clogging would disproportionately increase the total head losses in the sand filte...|$|R
40|$|The axial-flow {{compressor}} is {{used for}} aircraft engines because it has distinct configuration and performance advantages over other compressor types. However, good potential performance is not easily obtained. The designer {{must be able to}} model the actual flows well enough to adequately predict aerodynamic performance. This computer program has been developed for computing the aerodynamic design of a multistage axial-flow compressor and, if desired, the associated blading geometry input for internal flow analysis. The aerodynamic solution gives velocity diagrams on selected streamlines of revolution at the blade row edges. The program yields aerodynamic and blading design results that can be directly used by flow and mechanical analysis codes. Two such codes are TSONIC, a blade-to-blade channel flow analysis code (COSMIC program LEW- 10977), and MERIDL, a more detailed hub-to-shroud flow analysis code (COSMIC program LEW- 12966). The aerodynamic and blading design program can reduce the time and effort required to obtain acceptable multistage axial-flow compressor configurations by generating good initial solutions and by being compatible with available analysis codes. The aerodynamic solution assumes steady, axisymmetric flow so that the problem is reduced to solving the two-dimensional flow field in the meridional plane. The streamline curvature method {{is used for}} the iterative aerodynamic solution at stations outside of the blade rows. If a blade design is desired, the blade elements are defined and stacked within the aerodynamic solution iteration. The blade <b>element</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet angles are established by empirical incidence and deviation angles to the relative flow angles of the velocity diagrams. The blade element centerline is composed of two segments tangentially joined at a transition point. The local blade angle variation of each element can be specified as a fourth-degree polynomial function of path distance. Blade element thickness can also be specified with fourth-degree polynomial functions of path distance from the maximum thickness point. Input to the aerodynamic and blading design program includes the annulus profile, the overall compressor mass flow, the pressure ratio, and the rotative speed. A number of input parameters are also used to specify and control the blade row aerodynamics and geometry. The output from the aerodynamic solution has an overall blade row and compressor performance summary followed by blade element parameters for the individual blade rows. If desired, the blade coordinates in the streamwise direction for internal flow analysis codes and the coordinates on plane sections through blades for fabrication drawings may be stored and printed. The aerodynamic and blading design program for multistage axial-flow compressors is written in FORTRAN IV for batch execution and has been implemented on an IBM 360 series computer with a central memory requirement of approximately 470 K of 8 bit bytes. This program was developed in 1981...|$|R
