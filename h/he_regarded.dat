5|$|A {{common theme}} in Humphrey de Bohun's actions was his fierce {{protection}} of what <b>he</b> <b>regarded</b> as his feudal privileges. His career {{was marked by}} turbulence and political strife, particularly in the Marches of Wales, but eventually he left a legacy of consolidated possessions there. In 1297, {{at the height of}} the conflict between Edward I and rebellious barons, the king had actively tried to undermine Hereford's authority in the Marches, but failed due to the good relations the earl enjoyed with the local men.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} after his return to Louisville, Blackburn opened a {{sanatorium}} near Cave Hill Cemetery. His failing health impeded {{the success of the}} endeavor, however, and in January 1887, he returned to the state capital of Frankfort—a city <b>he</b> <b>regarded</b> as his home—knowing that death was near. After a prolonged illness, he became comatose and died September 14, 1887. He was buried in Frankfort Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|After Abraham Lincoln's {{election}} as president, several Southern states announced their secession from the Union {{to form a}} new government, the Confederate States of America. Garfield read military texts while anxiously awaiting the war effort, which <b>he</b> <b>regarded</b> as a holy crusade against the Slave Power. In April 1861, the rebels bombarded Fort Sumter, one of the last federal outposts in the South, beginning the Civil War. Although he had no military training, Garfield knew that his place was in the Union Army.|$|E

5|$|After his death, Edwin {{came to be}} venerated as a saint by some, {{although}} his cult was eventually overshadowed by the ultimately more successful cult of Oswald, {{who was killed in}} 642. They met their deaths in battle against similar foes, the pagan Mercians and the British, thus allowing both of them to be perceived as martyrs; however, Bede's treatment of Oswald clearly demonstrates that <b>he</b> <b>regarded</b> him as an unambiguously saintly figure, a status that he did not accord to Edwin.|$|E
5|$|Icelandic-American actor Gunnar Hansen was {{selected}} {{for the role of}} Leatherface. <b>He</b> <b>regarded</b> Leatherface as being mentally retarded and having never learned to speak properly. To research his character in preparation for his role, Hansen visited a special needs school and watched how the students moved and spoke. John Larroquette performed the narration in the opening credits.|$|E
5|$|In 1877, Marsh named {{two species}} of Nanosaurus in {{separate}} publications, based on partial remains from the Morrison Formation of Garden Park, Colorado. One paper described N. agilis, based on YPM 1913, with remains including impressions of a dentary, and postcranial bits including an ilium, thigh bones, shin bones, and a fibula. The other paper named N. rex, a second species which Marsh based on YPM 1915 (also called 1925 in Galton, 2007), a complete thigh bone. <b>He</b> <b>regarded</b> both species as small ("fox-sized") animals. He assigned this genus to the now-abandoned family Nanosauridae.|$|E

5|$|In December 1933, Marquis {{began his}} last book, Keep the Last Bullet for Yourself: The True Story of Custer's Last Stand. Marquis {{considered}} this {{his most important}} work– the subject was his central interest and <b>he</b> <b>regarded</b> much of his previous work as mere preparation for it. The book was completed in March 1934. However, his publisher, the Midwest Company, {{went out of business}} shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|In May 1942, the Australian {{government}} appointed Air Vice Marshal George Jones as Chief of the Air Staff. He became {{responsible for}} matters other than operations, such as administration and training. It {{soon became clear}} that Jones and Bostock could not get along together, but Kenney preferred to have Bostock in operational command, and although <b>he</b> <b>regarded</b> the antipathy between Jones and Bostock as a nuisance, was happy to leave arrangements the way they were.|$|E
5|$|John H. Flood Jr., Wyatt Earp's secretary, who <b>he</b> <b>regarded</b> like a son, drew {{a sketch}} of the gunfight at the O.K. Corral in 1926 under Wyatt's supervision. The drawing placed {{participants}} and selected witnesses on Fremont Street in Tombstone, and Earp annotated it with lines indicating how the participants moved during the 30-second shootout. It was sold at auction by Alexander Autographs in early October 2010, for $380,000.|$|E

5|$|Leonardo {{received}} an informal education in Latin, geometry and mathematics. In later life, Leonardo recorded only two childhood incidents. One, which <b>he</b> <b>regarded</b> as an omen, was when a kite {{dropped from the}} sky and hovered over his cradle, its tail feathers brushing his face. The second occurred while he was exploring in the mountains: he discovered a cave and was both terrified that some great monster might lurk there and driven by curiosity {{to find out what}} was inside.|$|E
5|$|The {{recording}} of the transit is {{seen by many as}} the birth of modern astronomy in Britain. John Flamsteed later said <b>he</b> <b>regarded</b> Horrocks, Crabtree and Gascoigne as the founding fathers of British research astronomy and the intellectual heirs to Galileo and Kepler. and began his three folio volume, Historia Coelestis Britannica (1745) by printing five pages of their letters and observations made between 1638 and 1643.|$|E
5|$|After the Free State {{government}} dismissed {{an ultimatum}} from Pretorius to cease what <b>he</b> <b>regarded</b> as the marginalisation {{of his supporters}} south of the Vaal, Pretorius called up the burghers and rode to the border, prompting President Jacobus Nicolaas Boshoff of the Free State to do the same. Kruger was dismayed to learn of this and on reaching the Transvaal commando he spoke out against the idea of fighting their fellow Boers. When he learned that Boshoff had called on Schoeman to lead a commando against Pretorius from Zoutpansberg and Lydenburg, he realised that disbanding was no longer enough {{and that they would}} have to make terms.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he made no}} pretence {{regarding}} {{the significance of the}} Senate under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from the Senate, and in the distribution of public offices he rarely favoured family members; a policy that stood in contrast to the nepotism practiced by Vespasian and Titus. Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of the Senate or his own family, whom <b>he</b> <b>regarded</b> with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.|$|E
5|$|Edgar was {{concerned}} about different interpretations of the Benedictine Rule in different monasteries in his kingdom, and wanted to impose uniform rules {{to be followed by}} all. The rules were set out in the key document of the English reform, the Regularis Concordia, which was adopted by the Council of Winchester in around 970. The Concordia was written by Æthelwold, who had sought advice from Ghent and Fleury Abbeys. A major aim of the Concordia was the regularisation of the form of church services, and Æthelwold tried to synthesise what <b>he</b> <b>regarded</b> as the best Continental and English practice.|$|E
5|$|For {{his next}} feature film, Pitt starred {{opposite}} Cate Blanchett in Alejandro González Iñárritu's multi-narrative drama Babel (2006). Pitt's performance was critically well-received, and the Seattle Post-Intelligencer {{said that he}} was credible and gave the film visibility. Pitt later said <b>he</b> <b>regarded</b> taking the part {{as one of the best}} decisions of his career. The film was screened at a special presentation at the 2006 Cannes Film Festival and was later featured at the 2006 Toronto International Film Festival. Babel received seven Academy and Golden Globe award nominations, winning the Best Drama Golden Globe, and earned Pitt a nomination for the Best Supporting Actor Golden Globe. That same year, Pitt's company Plan B Entertainment produced The Departed, which won the Academy Award for Best Picture. Pitt was credited on-screen as a producer; however, only Graham King was ruled eligible for the Oscar win.|$|E
60|$|When we inquire, {{as well as}} the unformed {{condition}} of terrestrial sociology permits, into the aggregatory ideas that seem to satisfy men, we find a remarkable complex, a disorderly complex, in the minds of nearly all our civilised contemporaries. For example, all sorts of aggregatory ideas come and go across the chameleon surfaces of my botanist's mind. He has a strong feeling for systematic botanists as against plant physiologists, whom <b>he</b> <b>regards</b> as lewd and evil scoundrels in this relation, but he has a strong feeling for all botanists, and, indeed, all biologists, as against physicists, and those who profess the exact sciences, all of whom <b>he</b> <b>regards</b> as dull, mechanical, ugly-minded scoundrels in this relation; but he has a strong feeling for all who profess what is called Science as against psychologists, sociologists, philosophers, and literary men, whom <b>he</b> <b>regards</b> as wild, foolish, immoral scoundrels in this relation; but he has a strong feeling for all educated men as against the working man, whom <b>he</b> <b>regards</b> as a cheating, lying, loafing, drunken, thievish, dirty scoundrel in this relation; but so soon as the working man is comprehended together with those others, as Englishmen--which includes, in this case, I may remark, the Scottish and Welsh--he holds them superior to all other sorts of European, whom <b>he</b> <b>regards,</b> &c....|$|R

5|$|In his {{theoretical}} writings, particularly Imperialism, Lenin discussed what <b>he</b> <b>regarded</b> as {{developments in}} capitalism since Marx's death; in his view, it {{had reached a}} new stage, state monopoly capitalism. He also believed that although Russia's economy was dominated by the peasantry, that monopoly capitalism existed in Russia meant {{that the country was}} sufficiently materially developed to move to socialism. Leninism adopted a more absolutist and doctrinaire perspective than other variants of Marxism, and distinguished itself by the emotional intensity of its liberationist vision. It also stood out by emphasising the role of a vanguard who could lead the proletariat to revolution, and elevated the role of violence as a revolutionary instrument.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, O'Reilly taught English {{to primary}} school {{children}} in Griffith, {{as well as}} singing—most of the pieces were Irish. At Rylstone he taught book-keeping and business, and {{he was promoted to}} the high school at Kandos. During this time he supplemented his income by travelling from town to town, playing in one-off cricket matches {{at the expense of the}} host's club. He worked on his bosie during the period and regularly dismissed outclassed opposition batsmen. O'Reilly regarded his cricketing isolation as highly beneficial as <b>he</b> <b>regarded</b> coaches to be ill-advised and detrimental to development.|$|E
5|$|It {{was only}} {{after the death of}} Ibn Killis in 991, that Mufarrij was able to return to Palestine. Ibn Killis had {{remained}} implacably opposed to Mufarrij, whom <b>he</b> <b>regarded</b> a dangerous individual: even on his deathbed, the vizier had urged al-Aziz to have Mufarrij executed should he fall into Fatimid hands, but in the event, the Caliph gave the Jarrahid a full pardon. In 992 al-Aziz invited Mufarrij to participate in the campaign against Aleppo under the Turkish general Manjutakin, but it is unclear whether Mufarrij fought in this or the subsequent campaigns, as he is not mentioned again until 996.|$|E
