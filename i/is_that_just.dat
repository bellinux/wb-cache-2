5|$|Despite {{the harsh}} environment, several life forms {{have been found}} that can {{withstand}} extreme space conditions for extended periods. Species of lichen carried on the ESA BIOPAN facility survived exposure for ten days in 2007. Seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana and Nicotiana tabacum germinated after being exposed to space for 1.5 years. A strain of bacillus subtilis has survived 559 days when exposed to low-Earth orbit or a simulated martian environment. The lithopanspermia hypothesis suggests that rocks ejected into outer space from life-harboring planets may successfully transport life forms to another habitable world. A conjecture <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> such a scenario occurred early {{in the history of}} the Solar System, with potentially microorganism-bearing rocks being exchanged between Venus, Earth, and Mars.|$|E
25|$|The overall {{result of}} the distortions in the tariff {{structure}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> 81 percent of economic costs of supply are covered, leading to a financial situation that is not sustainable {{in the short term}} and that could lead the country to face a severe energy crisis by 2010.|$|E
25|$|In 1899 the {{astronomer}} Karl Schwarzschild pointed out an observation about double stars. The motion of two stars orbiting {{each other is}} planar, the two orbits {{of the stars of}} the system lie in a plane. In the case of sufficiently near double star systems, it can be seen from Earth whether the perihelion of the orbits of the two stars remains pointing in the same direction with respect to the solar system. Schwarzschild pointed out that that was invariably seen: the direction of the angular momentum of all observed double star systems remains fixed with respect to the direction of the angular momentum of the Solar system. The logical inference <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> like gyroscopes, the angular momentum of all celestial bodies is angular momentum with respect to a universal inertial space.|$|E

500|$|Retrogenesis is {{a medical}} {{hypothesis}} about the development and progress of Alzheimer's disease proposed by Barry Reisberg in the 1980s. The hypothesis <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> as the fetus goes {{through a process of}} neurodevelopment beginning with neurulation and ending with myelination, the brains of people with AD go through a reverse neurodegeneration process starting with demyelination and death of axons (white matter) and ending with the death of grey matter. Likewise the hypothesis is, that as infants go through states of cognitive development, people with AD go through the reverse process of progressive cognitive impairment. Reisberg developed the caregiving assessment tool known as [...] "FAST" [...] (Functional Assessment Staging Tool) which he says allows those caring for AD patients to identify the stages of disease progression and that provides advice about the kind of care needed at each stage.|$|E

2500|$|The {{message of}} the Book of Daniel <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>just</b> as the God of Israel saved Daniel and his friends from their enemies, so he would save all Israel in their present oppression. The book is filled with monsters, angels, and numerology, drawn {{from a wide range}} of sources, both biblical and non-biblical, that would have had meaning in the context of 2nd century Jewish culture, and while Christian interpreters have always viewed these as {{predicting}} events in the New Testament – [...] "the Son of God", [...] "the Son of Man", Christ and the Antichrist - the book's intended audience is the Jews of the 2nd century BCE. The following explains a few of these predictions, as understood by modern biblical scholars.|$|E
2500|$|His {{argument}} <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>just</b> as an astrologer {{must consider}} cultural differences [...] "lest he mistake the appropriate customs and manners by assigning, for example, marriage with a sister to {{one who is}} Italian by race, instead of to the Egyptian as he should", {{it is necessary to}} consider the age in life that important astrological events occur. This is to ensure the prediction will [...] "harmonise those details which are contemplated in temporal terms with that which is suitable and possible for persons in the various age-classes" [...] and avoid out-of-context predictions such as imminent marriage for a young child, or [...] "to an extremely old man the begetting of children or anything else that fits younger men".

2500|$|The Book of Daniel is {{a biblical}} apocalypse, {{combining}} a prophecy of history with an eschatology (the study of last things) {{which is both}} cosmic in scope and political in its focus. It is [...] "an account of the activities and visions of Daniel, a noble Jew exiled at Babylon." [...] In the Hebrew Bible it {{is found in the}} Ketuvim (writings), while in Christian Bibles it is grouped with the Major Prophets. The book divides into two parts, a set of six court tales in chapters 1–6 followed by four apocalyptic visions in chapters 7–12. The deuterocanon contains three additional stories, the Song of the Three Holy Children, Susanna, and Bel and the Dragon. Its message <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> as the God of Israel saved Daniel and his friends from their enemies, so he would save all of Israel in their present oppression.|$|E

2500|$|For ligand-gated ion {{channels}} or {{channels that}} are modulated by metabotropic receptors, the neurotransmitter or drug being studied is usually {{included in the}} pipette solution, where it can interact with {{what used to be}} the external surface of the membrane. The resulting channel activity can be attributed to the drug being used, although it is usually not possible to then change the drug concentration inside the pipette. The technique is thus limited to one point in a dose response curve per patch. Therefore, the dose response is accomplished using several cells and patches. [...] However, voltage-gated ion channels can be clamped successively at different membrane potentials in a single patch. This results in channel activation as a function of voltage, and a complete I-V (current-voltage) curve can be established in only one patch. Another potential drawback of this technique <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>just</b> as the intracellular pathways of the cell are not disturbed, they cannot be directly modified either.|$|E

60|$|The answer <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>just</b> as {{the second}} type of Charles is the result of feudal jealousies of the king, so the {{character}} of Agamemnon reflects the princely hatreds of what we may call the feudal age of Greece. The masterly portrait of Agamemnon could only have been designed to win the sympathies of feudal listeners, princes with an Over-Lord whom they cannot repudiate, for whose office they have a traditional reverence, but whose power they submit to with no good will, and whose person and character some of them can barely tolerate.|$|E
