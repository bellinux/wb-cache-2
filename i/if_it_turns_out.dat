500|$|As part of {{the secrecy}} campaign, Benedict Cumberbatch denied that he was playing Khan during interviews, {{describing}} Harrison as simply a terrorist with his own purposes, as well as [...] "someone that's activated and manufactured in a way by Starfleet, and it's a scene that has {{come back to haunt}} him." [...] He discussed the character's moral ambiguity saying it fit the adage [...] "one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter," [...] adding parallels to the current world order [...] "whether it's U.S. foreign policy or the actions of some terrorists." [...] Into Darkness writers Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman added that they used the character of Khan not just for his popularity with the fandom—"It’s so easy to fall into the trap of doing something because you {{think people are going to}} love it.

500|$|Many {{critical}} {{reviews of}} the work came from scientists who objected to Bakker's looseness with scientific fact. The paleontologist Thomas Holtz noted that Bakker combined fauna in ways not directly supported by the fossil record; for example, several of the dinosaurs featured in the books lived millions of years after Utahraptor died out. Michael Taylor, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the National Museums of Scotland, panned the book, saying that [...] "Raptor Red is an accurate portrayal only {{within the context of}} uncertainties over the reconstruction of fossil animals as living forms ... Bakker's postscript never really admits these uncertainties." [...] David B. Norman criticized the book as [...] "no more than a children's adventure story—and a rather poorly written one at that ... The merging of science and fantasy is at its worst in books like Raptor Red because none but the experts can disentangle fact from fiction; this type of nonsense turns an uninformed reader into a misinformed one." [...] Jay Ingram, from the Discovery Channel, published a rebuttal, saying, [...] "The most important point is that Bakker's portrayal of the dinosaurs in Raptor Red is vivid—vivid in a way few museum displays or factual accounts can be. And <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> in the long run that some of the speculation is unwarranted, who cares? Bob Bakker has given us a unique window onto the era of dinosaurs." ...|$|E

500|$|To {{accommodate}} the video production, {{the equivalent of}} a television studio control room—costing US$3.5million—was built for the tour. Beneath the stage, Dodds, the video director, operated a system custom-built by Philips called CD-i. It used fivebroadcast camera systems, 12Laser Disc players, and a satellite dish, and it required 12directors, 19video crew members, and two separate mix stations to operate. To enable each band member to perform away from their personal monitor speakers on the main stage, sound engineers used joysticks to control a panning matrix for each member's in-ear monitor as they moved around. Despite the production's complexity, the group decided that flexibility in the shows' length and content was a priority. Guitarist the Edge said, [...] "That was one of the more important decisions we made early on, that we wouldn't sacrifice flexibility, so we designed a system that is both extremely complicated and high-tech but also incredibly simple and hands-on, controlled by human beings... in that sense, it's still a live performance." [...] This flexibility allowed for improvisations and deviations from the planned programme. Eno recommended that U2 film its own video tapes so that they could be edited and looped into the video displays more easily, instead of relying entirely on pre-sequenced video. Eno explained, [...] "their show depends on some kind of response to what's happening at the moment in that place. So <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> they want to do a song for five minutes longer, they can actually loop through the material again so that you're not suddenly stuck with black screens halfway through the fifth verse." [...] The band shot new video for the displays {{over the course of the}} tour.|$|E
500|$|Since the album's {{release in}} early April, Carey had said {{publicly}} that she planned on {{embarking on a}} large worldwide tour in support of E=MC². In an interview with Billboard on March 28, 2008, Carey explained [...] "It's come up, and I'm probably {{going to do it}}, but I don't know exactly how we're going to do it or when. I'm thinking probably September. But I think it's important to tour with this album, {{because there are so many}} songs that I really want to sing live, that I really enjoy." [...] Months later, in an interview with MTV News in July, Carey further addressed her plans of a tour: [...] "We're looking at November right now. Please don't hold me accountable <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> to be December 5 or December 7 or January 18!" [...] When asked to describe the tour's theme, Carey explained [...] "I'm thinking elaborate. I like elaborate. We only do substantial. That's what my jeweler says. I haven't gotten the looks in mind just yet, but we're going to figure it out soon enough." [...] Despite continued plans for a tour, and announcements made on The X Factor in United Kingdom in November, the tour was suddenly cancelled by early December. Tabloids and critics began heavily speculating that Carey had become pregnant, and had abandoned plans for a tour as a result. Many claimed to have seen Carey visiting a famed gynecologist's office in Los Angeles. Additionally, Carey's newly slimmed figure began to change, as she stopped her exercise routines and gained weight. Though Carey had eventually announced that she was pregnant with twins on November 28, 2010, over two years later, she admitted she had indeed been pregnant during that time period, and suffered a miscarriage. For that reason, she cancelled the tour, and lost the child only two months later.|$|E
2500|$|Some pro-life {{supporters}} {{argue that}} if there is uncertainty as to whether the fetus has a right to life, then having an abortion is equivalent to consciously taking the risk of killing another. [...] According to this argument, if it is not known for certain whether something (such as the fetus) has a right to life, then it is reckless, and morally wrong, to treat that thing as if it lacks a right to life (for example by killing it). [...] This would place abortion in the same moral category as manslaughter (<b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> that the fetus has a right to life) or certain forms of criminal negligence (<b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> that the fetus does not have a right to life).|$|E

2500|$|This {{proposed}} classification {{has tried}} to integrate the results of recent molecular work by using unranked clades for taxa below the traditional rank of class (class Gastropoda) but above the rank of superfamily (replacing the ranks subclass, superorder, order, and suborder), while still using the traditional Linnaean ranks for superfamilies and all taxa below the rank of superfamily (i.e., family, subfamily, tribe, genus, subgenus, and species. The clades have been given names which are similar to, {{or in some cases}} the same as, traditional Linnaean names for taxa above the level of superfamily. Whenever monophyly (a single ancestry) has not yet been tested and confirmed, or where a traditional taxon of gastropods has already been discovered to be [...] paraphyletic (that it excludes some of its descendants) the term [...] "group" [...] or [...] "informal group" [...] has been used.

2500|$|Some {{local governments}} may also claim {{a lack of}} {{sufficient}} funding for priority programs and services such as public safety. [...] This is intended to make a tax proposal more politically attractive. [...] When this occurs, local politicians need to explain to voters what government services {{are more important than}} public safety so as to result in inadequate funding for public safety services using existing taxes. [...] <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> the reason is high public employee salaries and benefits, this is a major red flag. [...] The California Constitution mandates that the “protection of the public safety is the first responsibility of local government and local officials have an obligation to give priority to the provision of adequate public safety services.” [...] This constitutional obligation exists regardless of whether a local tax measure is approved by voters. [...] Thus, even if a tax measure is rejected, the local government still has an obligation using its already existing revenues to give priority to public safety services.|$|E
2500|$|Entomologists from Ivan Regen onward {{have agreed}} that the {{principal}} purpose of a male cricket's [...] "song" [...] is to attract females for mating. Berthold Laufer and Frank Lutz recognized the fact but noted {{that it was not}} clear why males do it continuously throughout most of their adult lives, when actual mating doesn't take much time. More is known about the attractive mechanism of a cricket's song. Scientists exposed cricket females to synthesized [...] "cricket songs", carefully varying different acoustic parameters, and measured the degree of females' response to different sounds. They found that although each species has its own optimal mating call, the repetition rate of chirp [...] "syllables" [...] was the single most important parameter. A male's singing skills do not guarantee him instant success: other, silent, males may be waiting nearby to intercept the females he attracts. Other males may be attracted by the song and rush to the singer just as females do. When another cricket confronts a singing male, the two insects determine each other's sex by touching their antennae. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> that both crickets are male, the contact leads to a fight. Crickets, and Orthoptera in general, are model organisms for the study of male-male aggression, although females can also be aggressive. According to Judge and Bonanno, the shape and size of male crickets' heads are a direct result of selection through male-male fights.|$|E

5000|$|The Hor States {{originated}} when {{a prince}} of the Yuan Dynasty entered {{the region and}} {{had a relationship with}} a daughter of a chieftain; however, when it resulted in a child, he had departed.

The prince's companion, lama Ga Anyen Dampa (...) , stayed a while longer, founding a prominent local temple. The Hor states next appear in the historical record in the 1600s; when the Gelugpa sect built monasteries (thirteen in local accounts) across the Hor states; this move connected them to the Ganden Podrang elite and amplified the region's prosperity. The Qing Dynasty bestowed ranks on the rulers of the Hor states. The Hor States, unlike many of Tibet's traditional states were not brought to an end by increasing centralisation from the Chinese government; but instead survived the end of Qing rule and became governed from Lhasa. However, a rebellion in the early 1930s made the Hor States practically independent; this continued until Communist rule.|$|R
