5|$|In May 1944, Lieutenant Commander Hashimoto {{was given}} command of {{submarine}} I-58 {{which was still}} under construction in Sasebo. Hashimoto oversaw much {{of the construction of}} I-58. The submarine was later overhauled mid-construction to carry Kaiten manned torpedoes, which was considered a <b>great</b> <b>honor</b> by Hashimoto's crew. I-58 was commissioned on 13 September 1944 and Hashimoto commanded her during her shakedown cruises, commanding his men on repeated drills without shore leave. He completed training on the submarine in December 1944. The ship traversed Shimonoseki Strait into the Inland Sea and to Kure for supplies. She then moved to Hirao where she loaded six kaitens.|$|E

Since you people can't hear too good and I'm not too good a speaker I won't say much, but it's a <b>great</b> <b>honor</b> to be here. The two days I've spent in Canton will certainly bring me back every year from now on. Thank you very much.|$|E
5|$|Mt. St. Peter Parish has {{a branch}} of the Saint Vincent De Paul Society. The goal of this branch of the society, like all other branches, is to help the poor, the sick, and the suffering. Members of this group work to help people locally by {{collecting}} food and delivering it to food banks in and around New Kensington. Within the church, it is seen as a <b>great</b> <b>honor</b> {{to be part of this}} society and the members believe that the best help lies in the people they are more than in the caring acts they perform. They all work together to help others and they continually strive to become better Catholics.|$|E
25|$|Posidonius met Pompey {{when he was}} Rhodes's {{ambassador}} in Rome and Pompey visited him in Rhodes twice, once in 66 BCE during his campaign against the pirates and again in 62 BCE during his eastern campaigns, and asked Posidonius to write his biography.

25|$|For the {{traditional}} observance of the day, school children form processions through the hallways {{of the school}} building carrying candles, and hand out lussekatt buns.

25|$|Actors form {{schools or}} are {{associated}} with a particular theatre. Every actor has a stage name, which is different from the name they were born with. These stagenames, most often those of the actor's father, grandfather, or teacher, are passed down between generations of actors' lineages, and hold <b>great</b> <b>honor</b> and importance. Many names {{are associated with}} certain roles or acting styles, and the new possessor of each name must live up to these expectations; there is the feeling almost of the actor not only taking a name, but embodying the spirit, style, or skill of each actor to previously hold that name. Many actors will go through at least three names over the course of their career.|$|E
25|$|The Olympic Torch Relay ends {{on the day}} of {{the opening}} {{ceremony}} in the central stadium of the Games. The final carrier is often kept unannounced until the last moment, and is usually a sports celebrity of the host country. The final bearer of the torch runs towards the cauldron, often placed at the top of a grand staircase, and then uses the torch to start the flame in the arena. It is considered to be a <b>great</b> <b>honor</b> to be asked to light the Olympic flame. After being lit, the flame continues to burn throughout the Games, until the day of the closing ceremony and celebration, when it is finally put out, symbolizing the official end of the Games.|$|E
25|$|In Romania and Moldova, Epiphany, {{is called}} Boboteaza. In {{south-eastern}} Romania, following religious services, men participate in winter horse races. Before the race, the men {{line up with}} their horses before the priest, who will bless them by sprinkling them with green branches that have been dipped into Epiphany holy water. Sometimes people desire to have this blessing for themselves as well. Winning the Epiphany race is a <b>great</b> <b>honor</b> for both horse and rider, while the post-race celebrations, win or not, are highly festive. As in other Orthodox heritage countries, water rites play a special role on this day. A unique piece of Romanian folk wisdom holds that if a girl slips on ice – or better yet falls into water- on Epiphany, she will surely marry before the year is out.|$|E

25|$|In 1882, Moore {{sold the}} Gertrude {{and built the}} Pacific Slope, {{but by the end}} of the year, he had fallen on hard times again and sold the Pacific Slope to Andrew Onderdonk and {{declared}} bankruptcy again, losing not only his sternwheelers, but also his home and properties in Victoria. John Irving purchased the Western Slope at auction, and being a man of <b>great</b> <b>honor,</b> hired Billie to be her captain, Henry her mate and John her purser, thus helping his rival's family remain solvent. William Moore, now 60, was hardly ready to become an employee of his old rival's 28-year-old son, so he built another sternwheeler, the Teaser, which was eventually seized by creditors (despite Billie's attempt to hide her in Alaska), and sold and renamed the Rainbow.|$|E
25|$|North Korea's {{relationships}} with the international community, especially South Korea, have sometimes been shaped by sports diplomacy. In the 1966 World Cup, North Korea defeated the heavily favored Italian team. Kim Jong-il believed that successful athletics increases {{the strength of a}} country, promoted its ideology, brought a country <b>great</b> <b>honor</b> and increased its international reputation. For this reason, this victory has become propaganda used by the North Korean regime to present a reputable country to not only their citizens, but also to the international community as a whole. Although North Korea has not had much success since this victory, North Korea participated in the 2010 World Cup. In addition, North Korea was surrounded by controversy during 2006 World Cup qualifying. Fan violence in Pyongyang after a match with Iran led to North Korea playing a home game in Thailand without any fans.|$|E
25|$|The Sasanian nobility was {{a mixture}} of old Parthian clans, Persian aristocratic {{families}}, and noble families from subjected territories. Many new noble families had risen after the dissolution of the Parthian dynasty, while several of the once-dominant Seven Parthian clans remained of high importance. At the court of Ardashir I, the old Arsacid families of the House of Karen and the House of Suren, along with several other families, the Varazes and Andigans, held positions of <b>great</b> <b>honor.</b> Alongside these Iranian and non-Iranian noble families, the kings of Merv, Abarshahr, Kirman, Sakastan, Iberia, and Adiabene, who are mentioned as holding positions of honor amongst the nobles, appeared at the court of the shahanshah. Indeed, the extensive domains of the Surens, Karens and Varazes, had become part of the original Sassanid state as semi-independent states. Thus, the noble families that attended at the court of the Sassanid empire continued to be ruling lines in their own right, although subordinate to the shahanshah.|$|E

25|$|At the time, Prague had {{the third}} largest {{university}} clinic in the German speaking world {{and it was a}} <b>great</b> <b>honor</b> for Kocher when he received a call as a professor to Prague in spring 1880. Many colleagues, especially international ones, urged Kocher to accept while Bernese doctors and colleagues begged him to stay. Kocher used this call, to demand certain improvements for the university clinic from the Bernese government. They accepted all his demands, the government promised him to begin building the new Inselspital building the next year, increased his credit for surgical equipment and books to 1000 franks and increased the number of beds for Kocher in the new Inselspital. Thus, Kocher decided to stay and many Bernese and Swiss students and professionals thanked him for it. He cited the affection of his students as one of his main reasons for staying. The university students organized a torchlight procession on 8 June 1880 in his honor.|$|E
25|$|Nahum Gelber {{reports a}} story how Maggid Kluger {{attempted}} to leave Brody having accepted {{the invitation of}} Berezhany community and by an unlucky providence was forced to return to Brody. In 1843, Rabbi Kluger left his community in Brody and accepted the invitation of the community Berezhany community who, in 1845, elected him the supreme judicial authority. Despite the pleas of the Brody community leaders, the Magid left Brody and moved to Berezhany. In the winter of 1845, a delegation from Brody arrived in Berezhany and took him back to their town. In Berezhany he was received with <b>great</b> <b>honor,</b> especially by Rabbi Arie Leibush Natanson, father of the Lvov Rabbi, Rabbi Joseph Saul Nathanson, who {{had served as a}} Rain Berezhany prior to his appointment as a Rabbi in Lvov. A few days after his first sermon in Berezhany, the Magid caught typhus. He was sick for many years, and through this understood that he should not had left Brody. He vowed to leave Berezhany and return to Brody {{as soon as he got}} better, and no pleading on behalf of Berezhany messengers changed his mind. He resided in Brody as a private person, refraining from intruding into the activities of Brody's new Teacher of Justice. His admirers, and especially Rabbi Joseph Natanson, supported him for the rest of his life.|$|E
25|$|The Ottoman {{defeat at}} the Battle of Ankara in July 1402 and the {{subsequent}} disappearance of Sultan Bayezid I presented {{an opportunity for the}} Serbian magnates {{to take advantage of the}} turmoil and wield more autonomy in their political decision making. Having fought on the side of the Ottomans, they returned from Ankara through Byzantine-held territory. The new political landscape made for closer Byzantine–Serbian cooperation, and in August 1402, at Constantinople, Byzantine Emperor Manuel II Palaiologos awarded one of the Serbian magnates, Stefan Lazarević, the very high title of Despot. Second only to imperial dignity, the title brought the bearer <b>great</b> <b>honor.</b> From Constantinople, Lazarević was hoping to pave the way for an independent Serbia. While staying there, he came to quarrel with another Serbian magnate, his nephew Đurađ Branković. Although the reasons remain unknown, fifteenth- and sixteenth-century Ragusan chronicler Mavro Orbini attributes the quarrel to Lazarević's suspicions that Branković wanted to join forces with Süleyman Çelebi, Bayezid's oldest son, who held power in Rumelia. The historian Dimitris Kastritsis notes that the rivalry between Branković and Lazarević dated back to the time of Bayezid, who had expelled Branković's father from his lands and granted some of them to Lazarević. Although Lazarević aimed to induce Emperor John VII to imprison Branković, it is not certain if he succeeded. In 1402, Lazarević ordered Branković imprisoned, but the latter spent little time in captivity, as he was freed with the help of a friend in September of that year. Branković immediately went to Süleyman Çelebi, whom he asked for troops to fight Lazarević.|$|E
