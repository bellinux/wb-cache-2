40|$|The thesis investigates optical {{measuring}} {{and statistical}} data processing, and presents {{a method to}} understand and reduce sawing variation by examination of sawn timber sizes. Continuous timber size control offers improved opportunities for analysing <b>saw</b> <b>machines</b> or even individual sawblades. The thesis is illustrated with seven <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> case studies {{that relate to the}} development of the technique. Log and cant breakdown is examined in single- and double-arbor circular saws and bandsaws. The first analysis of each <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> is made in normal production, and the second using a controlled benchmarking test. A total of 44350 logs were sawn in the study. The behaviour of a <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> is described using such descriptors as total, within-board and between-board standard deviations, and sawblade bend. Based on observations in benchmarking, an equation y=αeβx±R, where α and β are constants, R the process reproducibility, and x a variable that expresses sawing time and saw load, can be established for each of the <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> descriptors. An example is the total standard deviation descriptor function s= 0. 21 e 0. 58 x± 0. 11, established for a single-arbor circular saw in a 4 -piece saw set-up. The method will help a sawmill to establish descriptors and equations used to describe the behaviour of their <b>saw</b> <b>machines,</b> to baseline <b>saw</b> <b>machine</b> performance and to compare it to best practices in the industry. The descriptors may be used to establish current, short- or long-term capabilities and characteristics. The method can be used to examine various production conditions and tooling, such as effects of log size, feed speed, and sawing time. Other factors include saw speed, sawblade parameters, operation of setworks and feedworks, and effects of seasons. The results of the study show that sawblade behaviour, feedworks and work piece holding problems, and previous <b>saw</b> <b>machines</b> may be causes of large sawing variation. reviewe...|$|R
