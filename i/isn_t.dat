In principle {{there is nothing wrong with}} this, of course. Political fashions and intellectual preoccupations are bound to change, and historical research is bound to follow. In this particular case, though, the shift in perspective has sometimes resulted in a narrowing of perspective as well, as the old concerns of social history have fallen by the wayside.

40|$|Esse trabalho tem por objeto de análise um documento curricular elaborado e implementado pelo Estado do Tocantins para a rede pública estadual de ensino (Referencial Curricular). Para tanto, a pesquisa levou em consideração a situação histórica de criação e manutenção de um saber geográfico na escola, bem como da contextualização das novidades pedagógicas que têm aparecido recentemente no bojo das reformas curriculares. Assim procedendo, pressupôs-se que haveria um painel razoavelmente desenhado para abalizar a análise do documento. O Referencial Curricular refletiu as transformações que vêm ocorrendo em cenários mundial e nacional. As reformas educacionais que eclodiram pelo mundo na transição do século XX/XXI tiveram centralidade no currículo. Os Parâmetros Curriculares Nacionais (PCN), no Brasil, corresponderam a esse movimento de reordenamento da função da escola. Os PCN, por sua vez, influenciaram a elaboração das propostas estaduais e municipais. No Tocantins não foi diferente. Replicando as mesmas dificuldades teórico-operacionais dos Parâmetros, o documento {{regional}} pouco auxiliou na articulação de uma narrativa geográfica coerente, do ponto de epistemológico. Nesse sentido, não houve nenhuma opção declarada: não se admitiu como inscrita na vertente tradicional, nem crítica, nem humanista, nem qualquer outra embora, no conjunto, o documento apresentou mais características da primeira. A proposta de renovar a prática pedagógica via competências e habilidades se manteve meramente no nível da intenção; isso porque houve pouca clareza na distinção entre o que seriam as competências e as habilidades, de um lado, e procedimentos de ensino, de outro. Um reflexo, portanto, da inconsistência teórica, no documento, da aplicação da pedagogia das competências no ensino de Geografia. Competências que, em função de sua plasticidade conceitual, deveriam ser tomadas com cuidado e clareza, no sentido de apresentar os potenciais e os riscos envolvidos ao adotá-las em um currículo. Como balanço geral, os resultados não são animadores, uma vez que as confusões de ordem epistemológica e didática são flagrantes em todo o documentoThis work is {{an object}} of curriculum analysis prepared and implemented by the State of Tocantins to the state public education (Referencial Curricular). Therefore, the research considered the historical situation of creation and maintenance of a geographical knowledge in school, and the contextualization the new ideas that have appeared recently in the curriculum reforms. Thus, {{it is assumed that}} a panel designed to document analysis. The Referencial Curricular reflected the changes that are occurring in global and national contexts. Education reforms that broke the world at the transition of XX / XXI centuries had centrality in the curriculum. The Parâmetros Curriculares Nacionais (PCN) in Brazil corresponded with the movement of the reorganization of school function. The PCN influenced the development of state and local proposals. In Tocantins <b>wasn</b> <b>t</b> different. Replicating the same difficulties of theoretical and operational Parameters, the regional document just helped in the articulation of a geographical coherent narrative. By the way, there <b>wasn</b> <b>t</b> option declared: it was not admitted as entered in the traditional geography, or critical, or humanist or any other - although, overall, the document presented more characteristics of the first. The proposal to renew the teaching practice through competencies and abilities remained merely at the level of intention, because there <b>wasn</b> <b>t</b> distinction between what would be the competencies and abilities, and teaching procedures. This is a reflection the theoretical inconsistency in the document, and the application of teaching competencies in the Geography Education. Competencies that, due to its plasticity conceptual should be taken with care and clarity, to present the potential and the risks involved in adopting them on a curriculum.

40|$|O estudo aqui apresentado é uma investigação a respeito da cidadania. Inicialmente nossa análise se baseia num enfoque sócio-histórico-conceitual, uma vez que refletimos sobre a origem e evolução da cidadania numa perspectiva histórica, tanto no âmbito mundial quanto nacional. Ademais, apresentamos, laconicamente, alguns aspectos da cidade onde efetuamos o trabalho de campo e posteriormente analisamos o conceito de cidadania. Em seguida, nossa abordagem se consubstanciou em perquirir sobre as dificuldades e possibilidades de existência da cidadania, no espaço público e privado, para famílias de classes populares. Para tanto, baseamo-nos em depoimentos e nas condições sociais de seis famílias moradoras num bairro periférico da cidade de Presidente Prudente. O presente estudo tem como fio condutor a análise da ideologia relacional que faz parte da cultura popular - e à sobrevivência {{material}} dos sujeitos desta pesquisa. Assim, os principais empecilhos para existir cidadania, na esfera privada, se devem à presença dominante da referida ideologia, juntamente com as inúmeras privações de ordem material, às quais destacamos àquelas que se circunscrevem à moradia e ao bairro periférico. No tocante às possibilidades de haver cidadania, no espaço privado, enfoca o poder feminino, com a dimensão afetiva e a questão da solidariedade. Contudo, a cidadania não é realizada em razão da unilateralidade do poder feminino; pelo fato da esfera afetiva contribuir e reforçar tendências assimétricas em ambos os cônjuges e; somente a solidariedade não é suficiente para se garantir cidadania. Com relação à cidadania no espaço público, os obstáculos são infinitamente maiores do que as possibilidades para a sua realização, seja pela cultura política do favor (que tem afinidade com a ideologia relacional), seja pela presença marcante da ideologia relacional, da opressão e exploração no espaço do trabalho. The study present here is {{an investigation}} about citizenship. Initially our analysis is based on social-historical conceptual focus, since qe hare reflected on the origin and evolution of the citizenship on a perspective, as on the word as on the national ambit. Moreover, we present laconically {{some aspects of the}} city where we have performed the field work and afterwards we have analyzed the citizenship concept. Afterwards, our broach is consubstantiated on the analysis respecting the difficulties and possibilities of the citizenship existence, at the public and private space for the popular class families. For this, we have based on the declaration and the social conditions of six families who live in the peripherical district in the city of Presidente Pr. The present study has as a conductor thread the analysis about the relational ideology that is related to the popular culture and the material survival of the subjects on this research. Thus, the main hindrances to make citizenship exist on private sphere, is due to the dominant present of referred ideology along with the numberless privations of material sort, which we emphasize the ones that are encircled to the housing and the peripherical district. Concerning the possibilities to have citizenship, on the private space, it is related whit the feminine power, with the affective dimension and the matter of solidarity. However, the citizenship <b>isn</b> <b>t</b> performed in reason for the unilaterality of the feminine power; for the fact of the affective sphere contribute and reinforce asymmetrical in both married people and; only solidarith <b>isn</b> <b>t</b> enough to guarantee citizenship.

Bilateral optic disc drusen were confirmed on B-scan ultrasonography, autofluorescence retinography and retinal nerve fiber layer on Stratus- OCT®. Patient 2 : A 14 -year-old girl went on a routine ophtalmology examination. Her past medical and ocular history were irrelevant. On examination visual acuity was 10 / 10 in both eyes. Fundoscopy showed bilateral disc enlargement being interpreted as optic nerve head drusen. Bilateral optic nerve head drusen were confirmed on B-scan ultrasonography, autofluorescence retinography and retinal nerve fiber layer on Stratus-OCT®. Methods: B-scan ultrasonography, autofluorescence retinography and Stratus-OCT imaging were obtained. Results and Conclusion Both patients were assymptomatic. With non-invasive readily available exams, such as ultrasonography and OCT practioners must rule out optic nerve head before costly and invasive exams, even when there is a history and fundoscopy highly suggestible of papilledema. Optic nerve head drusen were first described in 1868 by Liebreich. They are mostly bilateral and assymptomatic, although some degree of visual field defect can be shown. Most cases of pseudopapilledema are due to the presence of optic nerve head drusen, there are some clinical characteristics that can help to differenciate one from another but the use of recent technology is needed to confirm the diagnosis...|$|R

Studies on child injury behavior highlighted {{the role of}} age and gender differences {{and the importance of}} sensation seeking in injury risk. There is poor research about parents influence on child injury behavior, mainly about educational practices and child monitoring and supervision. Furthermore, parenting stress is a significant variable either as educational styles mediator or for its direct effect on child development and psychological adjustment, but it hasn t been related to children s proneness to unintentional injuries. The aim {{of this study was to}} verify the relation between child injury behavior, internalizing and externalizing behaviors, sensation seeking and parenting stress, with particular interest in analyzing whether parenting stress could predict a greater proneness to unintentional injuries in children and preadolescents. Gender differences were also taken into account. Participants were 211 mothers and 211 fathers with children aged between 8 and 12 (98 males and 113 females). Parents were asked to complete Injury Behavior Checklist, Child Behavior Checklist 4 / 18 and Parenting Stress Index- SF. Children were asked to complete the Sensation Seeking Scale. Results highlighted that children and preadolescents at lower risk of unintentional injuries were females, reporting minor internalizing and externalizing behaviors, and had parents with null or low stress levels. On the contrary, subjects at greater risk were males, with externalizing behaviors, and had mothers with high levels of parenting stress. Sensation seeking <b>wasn</b> <b>t</b> a significant dimension in predicting injury behavior either in males or in females. Moreover, only in the male sample did externalizing behaviors mediate the relationship between children s disposition to injury and mothers stress, caused by the perception of having a difficult child.

This study focuses on technical user interface design challenges and requirements for user interface design of controlling complex home appliances with tablet devices. There is a literature review about available controlling technologies and usability heuristics related to tablet and mobile devices. An Android test application was created and tested with four test users {{to find out}} how well those heuristics work and are covered. That application was tested against the regular user interface of a dishwasher and task completion times and errors were noted down. Test users were asked to answer a questionnaire regarding the heuristics and how well the implementation performed. Tablet devices should be evaluated using regular usability heuristics, but besides them they require mobile specific heuristics, such as easy of input, screen readability and glancability, physical interaction and ergonomics and privacy and social convention taken into account. The results showed that a tablet user interface was able to outperform its regular counterpart in task completion times and in number of errors. The implementation also covered those heuristics in a more comprehensive way. But among test persons the most benefit was with users who were familiar with tablets and not with dishwashers. A test user who <b>wasn</b> <b>t</b> familiar with tablets but was with dishwashers performed tasks faster and with fewer errors with regular user interface. In conclusion a tablet user interface enabled users who were familiar with tablets to perform tasks faster and with less errors. Those users were also more satisfied with a tablet user interface than a regular one. On the other hand a test user with little experience of tablets and familiarity with dishwashers was able to perform tasks faster an with less errors with the regular user interface. A tablet user interface was able to offer extra benefits and efficiency to users, but regular user interface should be also available to satisfy users who are not familiar with mobile devices...|$|R
40|$|Why do we {{live with}} pets? Is there {{something}} more to our relationship with them than simply companionship? What is it we look for in our pets and {{what does this say}} about us as human beings? In this fascinating book, Erica Fudge explores the nature of this most complex of relationships and the difficulties of knowing what it is that one is living with when one chooses to share a home with an animal. Fudge argues that our capacity for compassion and ability to live alongside others is evident in our relationships with our pets, those paradoxical creatures who {{give us a sense of}} comfort and security while simultaneously troubling the categories human and animal. For what is a pet if it <b>isn</b> <b>t</b> a fully-fledged member of the human family? This book proposes that by crossing over these boundaries pets help construct who it is we think we are. Drawing on the works of modern writers, such as J. M. Coetzee, Elizabeth Marshall Thomas and Jacques Derrida, Fudge shows how pets have been used to think with and to undermine our easy conceptions of human, animal and home. Indeed, the book shows our obsession with domestic animals reveals many of the paradoxes, contradictions and ambiguities of life. Living with pets provides thought-provoking perspectives on our notions of possession and mastery, mutuality and cohabitation, love and dominance. We might think of pets as simply happy, loved additions to human homes but as this captivating book reveals perhaps it is the pets that make the home and without pets perhaps we might not be the humans we think we are. For anyone who has ever wondered what their cat is thinking, it will be illuminating readin...|$|E
40|$|Wireless capsule {{endoscopy}} (WCE) is a non-invasive {{diagnostic method}} to investigate diseases {{in the human}} gastrointestinal (GI) tract. Specifically, the WCE allows for physicians to visually inspect the GI tract of the patient who swallows the capsule. Thereafter, it transmits video wireless {{from the inside of}} the human body to the outside, for approximately eight hours. Because of the size and the limited battery of the capsule, the image quality can be quite poor. By reducing the average bitrate per pixel, the energy consumption will be reduced, which will allow higher quality images, higher framerate or resolution. When applying the YEF colour transformation instead of the YUV, as well as adaptive prediction, the rate can be reduced by circa 0. 12 - 0. 35 bpp. Additionally, this resulted in an increase in peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), depending on the input simulation video. On the other hand, these results were very dependent on the source video and might by different in a real implementation. This should be investigated further with simulation videos more similar to the ones captured by the camera sensor on the capsule. Another possible solution to improve the overall image quality is to encode some regions of the image in higher quality {{than the rest of the}} frame, known as region-of-interest (ROI) coding. A very low complexity, energy efficient, ROI coding scheme was proposed for the encoder (the capsule). The method relies on adaptive sampling rate within a frame, to create a region which <b>isn</b> <b>t</b> down-sampled or filtered. Simulations showed that it works as expected in the encoder, but it does have some problems at the decoder. This should be investigated further, as well as to correctly examine the increase in energy consumption in the proposed method...|$|E
40|$|At Langley Research Center, Erik Weiser and {{his colleagues}} in the Advanced Materials and Processing Branch were working with a new {{substance}} for fabricating composites for use in supersonic aircraft. The team, however, was experiencing some frustration. Every time they tried to create a solid composite from the polyimide (an advanced polymer) material, it bubbled and foamed. It seemed like the team had reached a dead end in their research - until they had another idea. "We said, This <b>isn</b> <b>t</b> going to work for composites, but maybe we could make a foam out of it," Weiser says. "That was kind of our eureka moment, {{to see if we could}} go in a whole other direction. And it worked. " Weiser {{and his colleagues}} invented a new kind of polyimide foam insulation they named TEEK. The innovation displayed a host of advantages over existing insulation options. Compared to other commercial foams, Weiser explains, polyimide foams perform well across a broad range of temperatures, noting that the NASA TEEK foams provide effective structural insulation up to 600 F and down to cryogenic temperatures. The foam does not burn or off-gas toxic fumes, and even at - 423 F - the temperature of liquid hydrogen - the material stays flexible. The inventors could produce the TEEK foam at a range of densities, from 0. 5 pounds per cubic foot up to 20 pounds per cubic foot, making the foam ideal for a range of applications, including as insulation for reusable launch vehicles and for cryogenic tanks and lines. They also developed a unique, friable balloon format for manufacturing the foam, producing it as hollow microspheres that allowed the foam to be molded and then cured into any desired shape - perfect for insulating pipes of different sizes and configurations. The team s originally unplanned invention won an "R&D 100 " award, and a later form of the foam, called LaRC FPF- 44 (Spinoff 2009), was named "NASA Invention of the Year" in 2007...|$|E
40|$|The {{control of}} crop grass weeds {{is a major}} {{limitation}} to the successful production of oats in Southern Australia. This {{is due to the}} combination of few registered herbicide options and limited knowledge on their effectiveness, coupled with effects of management, for different cultivars. Five trials with 6 cultivars were conducted between 1997 and 2001 in the southern wheatbelt of Western Australia to examine this problem. In a herbicide tolerance screen the yields of the cultivars Mortlock, Toodyay and Needilup were not reduced by any herbicide options tested and were therefore more tolerant to the chemical applications. The yields of the cultivar Hotham however, were reduced by all herbicide treatments except the safest treatments, indicating this cultivar is more sensitive. In the presence of weeds, the yields of Hotham and Needilup were not reduced by herbicides but had relatively high in crop weed biomass and therefore, can be regarded as both poor weed competitors and herbicide tolerant. The crop weed biomass of Mortlock and Toodyay was low and yield <b>wasn</b> <b>t</b> reduced by any of the herbicide options, therefore both were tolerant to the herbicides and competitive with weeds. Needilup had the strongest relationship between weed biomass and grain yield (R 2 = 0. 80) indicating that Needilup is more responsive than the other varieties tested to changes in weed biomass whilst less sensitive to herbicides. Two management practices to reduce weed competition were assessed, delayed sowing and increasing crop plant density. Utilising the delayed sowing allowed an extra knockdown herbicide to be applied and resulted in an average grain yield increase of 1. 5 t/ha and weed biomass reduction of 1 t/ha. When the target plant population was increased in the presence of weeds, weed biomass was reduced and grain yield was increased. Through the utilisation of alternative herbicides and changes in management, grass weeds can be effectively controlled in oat crops without reliance on a small number of herbicides (e. g. sulfonylureas). vokMyynti MTT tietopalvelu...|$|R

40|$|Through the {{analysis}} of social structure and mobility of rural population, based on data collected by a survey research, the author has got the insight both in actual situation and in changes which Croatian village has been through. He found that contemporary Croatian village is in the phase of so-called reconstruction, i. e. {{that it is not}} homogeneous but, on the contrary, its social structure is distinctly complex. Being one of the products of industrial development, occupations requiring manual work are still prevailing in the village, which makes it significantly different from the town. But, in this regard also younger active rural population differs from previous generations representing - through their schooling and work skills - the greatest innovation in contemporary Croatian village. For the great majority of rural population agriculture is not basic working sector, so - if aiming at comprising and comprehending the reality of contemporary Croatian village - the syntagm “rural areas and agriculture” completely misses this intention. Yet, it doesn’t mean that agriculture <b>isn</b> <b>t</b> still of great importance for a significant part of inhabitants of rural areas, regardless whether they are farmers or peasant-workers. It only means that in the priorities of most of them nonagricultural activity has come before agricultural one, and that the future development of the village can be recognized in preferences given to non-agricultural sector. Through {{the analysis}} the author established that rural population has many significant and useful resources at its disposal, which - under favourable conditions - can be used for a successful adaptation to the requirements of the transitional framework orientation. In the village there is no distinctive social group who would have some of the resources at its disposal, the one gained through one’s position in the socialist system and which could be converted into a higher social status. This characteristic couldn’t be attributed even to the socalled family cultural capital. The advancement in the hiearchy scale and involvement in enterprising projects {{is a result of the}} action of the totality of resources. As for rural settlements themselves, the social structure of their youngest active generation is their greatest resource...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: A {{sudden death}} {{is defined as}} a sudden {{cessation}} of heart work which happens within six hours, revionsly of good helth(1). The main characteristio of this phenomenon is tipically its beginning during or directly after a training or a competition which means after an intensive physical effort a causal factor. The first case of a sudden death because of physical effort was recorded in ancient 490 BC when a Greec called Pheidippides was running from Marathon Feild to Athens (42 km) to announce the news about the victory of the Athenians over the Persians. That is howa long distance runners discipline was defined in sport and got its name marathon. In medicine it {{is defined as a}}n entity of a sudden death of sportsmen after an intensive physical effort which is nowdays a current problem and an object of varions researches in medicine as well as in sports medicine of sports experts. A method of work: The authors published the statistic data processing obtained from accessible literature. The statistical analysis processes: a cause of a death on the basis of an autophsy, a frequency of the death in general population and death of sportsmen those under the age of 35 and over 35 (sportsmen and sportswotren), sort of sports the dead went in for, comparasion of them and giving conclusions and measures of prevention. Here we think about a big importance of sistematic checkup of the sportsmen, use and misuse of incriminated stimulants, the infuence of genetics in families of the sportsmen with heart diseases. The aim of work is to point to and warn of more and more frequent cases of sudden death of sportsmen and that it <b>isn</b> <b>t</b> drawn a moral from that:there are clubs and parents who still don t do the obligation to take their members and children to a sistematic checkup regularily. A systematic checkup should include all searches which would point out a negative influence of intensive physical effort (training, matches) on heath. Those tests are also stress tests, ultrasound of heart etc. Conclusion: It is compulsory to do the detailed systematic checkup of children, young people, sportsmen to prevent more and more frequent death on sports field becase health is more important than any sport resultor sport profit...|$|E

40|$|It was an {{unlikely}} moment for inspiration. Engineers David Wolf and Ray Schwarz stopped by their lab around midday. Wolf, of Johnson Space Center, and Schwarz, with NASA contractor Krug Life Sciences (now Wyle Laboratories Inc.), {{were part of}} a team tasked with developing a unique technology with the potential to enhance medical research. But that <b>wasn</b> <b>t</b> the focus at the moment: The pair was rounding up colleagues interested in grabbing some lunch. One of the lab s other Krug engineers, Tinh Trinh, was doing something that made Wolf forget about food. Trinh was toying with an electric drill. He had stuck the barrel of a syringe on the bit; it spun with a high-pitched whirr when he squeezed the drill s trigger. At the time, a multidisciplinary team of engineers and biologists including Wolf, Schwarz, Trinh, and project manager Charles D. Anderson, who formerly led the recovery of the Apollo capsules after splashdown and now worked for Krug was pursuing the development of a technology called a bioreactor, a cylindrical device used to culture human cells. The team s immediate goal was to grow human kidney cells to produce erythropoietin, a hormone that regulates red blood cell production and can be used to treat anemia. But there was a major barrier to the technology s success: Moving the liquid growth media to keep it from stagnating resulted in turbulent conditions that damaged the delicate cells, causing them to quickly die. The team was looking forward to testing the bioreactor in space, hoping the device would perform more effectively in microgravity. But on January 28, 1986, the Space Shuttle Challenger broke apart shortly after launch, killing its seven crewmembers. The subsequent grounding of the shuttle fleet had left researchers with no access to space, and thus no way to study the effects of microgravity on human cells. As Wolf looked from Trinh s syringe-capped drill to where the bioreactor sat on a workbench, he suddenly saw a possible solution to both problems. It dawned on me that rotating the wall of the reactor would solve one of our fundamental fluid mechanical problems, specifically by removing the velocity gradient of the tissue culture fluid media near the reactor s walls, says Wolf. It looked as though it would allow us to suspend the growing cells within the reactor without introducing turbulent fluid mechanical conditions...|$|R
