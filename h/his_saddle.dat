5|$|A young peasant named Diermot is {{employed}} as a beater for the king's hunting party. One night the king receives a note from a messenger, requesting his services to help quell a rebellion in the remote village of Turnvale. As the king's party departs, Diermotâ€™s pony follows them, unwittingly carrying him to the battle. When the party arrives at Turnvale they are not confronted by a peasant revolt. Instead they find a band of man-eating Skorl, led by an enchantress named Selena, the titular temptress. The king's men are defeated and the king is killed. In the process, Diermot is thrown from <b>his</b> <b>saddle</b> and is knocked unconscious. The Skorl take Diermot prisoner and imprison him in the local dungeon.|$|E
5|$|On {{the right}} flank, Pickett's Virginians crossed the Emmitsburg road and wheeled {{partially}} to their left to face northeast. They marched in two lines, {{led by the}} brigades of Brig. Gen. James L. Kemper {{on the right and}} Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett on the left; Brig. Gen. Lewis A. Armistead's brigade followed closely behind. As the division wheeled to the left, its right flank was exposed to McGilvery's guns and the front of Doubleday's Union division on Cemetery Ridge. Stannard's Vermont Brigade marched forward, faced north, and delivered withering fire into the rear of Kemper's brigade. At about this time, Hancock, who had been prominent in displaying himself on horseback to his men during the Confederate artillery bombardment, was wounded by a bullet striking the pommel of <b>his</b> <b>saddle,</b> entering his inner right thigh along with wood fragments and a large bent nail. He refused evacuation to the rear until the battle was settled.|$|E
5|$|Wyatt {{was lucky}} during the few gun fights he {{took part in}} from his {{earliest}} job as an assistant police officer in Wichita to Tombstone, where he was briefly deputy U.S. marshal. Unlike his lawmen brothers Virgil and James, Wyatt was never wounded, although once his clothing and <b>his</b> <b>saddle</b> were shot through with bullet holes. According to John H. Flood's biography (as dictated to him by Wyatt Earp), Wyatt vividly recalled a presence that in several instances warned him away or urged him to take action. This happened {{when he was on}} the street, alone in his room at the Cosmopolitan Hotel, at Bob Hatch's Pool Hall, where he went moments before Morgan was assassinated, and again when he approached Iron Springs and surprised Curly Bill Brocius, killing him.|$|E

5|$|Khal Drogo, delirious from an {{infection}} {{caused by the}} chest wound inflicted by Mago, falls from <b>his</b> <b>saddle,</b> {{a sign of weakness}} among the Dothraki. Daenerys takes Drogo into her tent and sends for Mirri Maz Duur to help him. However, Ser Jorah Mormont advises Daenerys that they should leave now because the Dothraki only respect the physically strong. He explains that, if Drogo dies, Qotho and the other bloodriders will fight amongst themselves to be his successor; whoever wins will kill her and her unborn child to prevent Drogo's son from growing up to be a rival. Daenerys refuses to abandon her husband, even when Mirri tells Daenerys that she cannot save him and instead advises giving Drogo a quick, clean death. In desperation, Daenerys encourages Mirri to use blood magic despite Mirri's warning about the consequences of such a spell, that only death can pay for life. Mirri brings Drogo's horse into the tent, slits its throat, orders everyone to leave, and warns that none must enter during the spell. Qotho, shocked at what Daenerys has done, tries to stop the spell, but Mormont kills him to prevent interference. Daenerys then goes into premature labor, but none of the Dothraki midwives help her, owing to their belief that she is cursed. In desperation, Mormont carries Daenerys into Drogo's tent to seek Mirri's help.|$|E
5|$|William left England {{towards the}} end of 1086. Following his arrival back on the {{continent}} he married his daughter Constance to Alan Fergant, the Duke of Brittany, in furtherance of his policy of seeking allies against the French kings. William's son Robert, still allied with the French king Philip I, appears to have been active in stirring up trouble, enough so that William led an expedition against the French Vexin in July 1087. While seizing Mantes, William either fell ill or was injured by the pommel of <b>his</b> <b>saddle.</b> He was taken to the priory of Saint Gervase at Rouen, where he died on 9 September 1087. Knowledge of the events preceding his death is confused because there are two different accounts. Orderic Vitalis preserves a lengthy account, complete with speeches made by many of the principals, but this is likely more of an account of how a king should die than of what actually happened. The other, the De Obitu Willelmi, or On the Death of William, {{has been shown to be}} a copy of two 9th-century accounts with names changed.|$|E
25|$|In 1870, during Lee's funeral procession, Traveller was led {{behind the}} caisson bearing the General's casket, <b>his</b> <b>saddle</b> and bridle draped with black crepe. Not long after Lee's death, in 1871, Traveller {{stepped on a}} nail and {{developed}} tetanus. There was no cure, and he was shot to relieve his suffering.|$|E

25|$|The rider who {{has taken}} most time is called the lanterne rouge (red lantern, as in the red light {{at the back of}} a vehicle so it {{can be seen in the}} dark) and in past years {{sometimes}} carried a small red light beneath <b>his</b> <b>saddle.</b> Such was sympathy that he could command higher fees in the races that previously followed the Tour. In 1939 and 1948 the organisers excluded the last rider every day, to encourage more competitive racing.|$|E
25|$|Count Nostitz {{immediately}} {{sprang from}} <b>his</b> <b>saddle,</b> and holding {{with his left}} hand the bridle of his own horse, which had been slightly wounded, he drew his sword, firmly resolved to shed, if necessary, the last drop of his blood in defence of his commander. Scarcely had he done so, when he saw the Cuirassiers rushing forward at the charge. To attract as little as possible their attention, he remained motionless. Most fortunately, the rapidity with which the Cuirassiers advanced amidst the twilight, already obscured by the falling rain, precluded them from recognising, or even particularly remarking, the group, although they swept so closely by that one of them rather roughly brushed against the aide de camp's horse.|$|E
50|$|As an adult, Thornbury {{first learned}} {{saddlery}} in Michigan but fine-tuned his art and tooling skills later from a Pima saddler named Mervyn Ringlero. Thornbury moved to California in the 1970s and became popular worldwide for <b>his</b> <b>saddles</b> and leather goods that included work for stuntmen in Hollywood. Thornbury {{continued in the}} rodeo as a Bronc rider, and at one point, was hired to model for Marlboro Man ads.|$|R

25|$|Further on the way, they {{encountered}} a small settlement called Cavett's Station on September 25. After they had surrounded the place, Benge {{negotiated with the}} inhabitants, agreeing that if they surrendered, their lives would be spared. However, after the settlers had walked out, Doublehead's group and his Muscogee allies attacked and began killing {{them all over the}} pleas of Benge and the others. Vann managed to grab one small boy and pull him onto <b>his</b> <b>saddle,</b> only to have Doublehead smash the boy's skull with an axe. Watts intervened in time to save another young boy, handing him to Vann, who put the boy behind him on his horse and later handed him over to three of the Muscogee for safe-keeping; unfortunately, one of the Muscogee chiefs killed the boy and scalped him a few days later.|$|E
25|$|On Day 98, one housemate {{was invited}} into the Diary Room. Camilla entered, and {{received}} a celebratory reception as she was informed she was the 1500th visitor to the Big Brother diary room. She was then told that she, and three friends in the house, would later that day dine with Big Brother. While the housemates had their meal with Big Brother, they were oblivious {{to the fact that}} one of each had a loved one in the house, leaving a gift for them. Max's mother cooked his favourite meal and left it simmering on the stove, David's mother left <b>his</b> <b>saddle</b> and boots for him in the bedroom, Camilla's friend left her some clothes and personal possessions, and Jamie's mother left him a clean pair of fisherman pants, a new headband and a much-needed belt.|$|E
25|$|Sun Ce's younger brother, Sun Quan, favoured Zhou Tai so he {{requested}} for Zhou {{to be transferred}} to his unit. Once, when Sun Ce was away on a campaign against some bandits who had emerged in the six counties of Kuaiji, Sun Quan was left in Xuancheng County (å®£åŸŽç¸£; present-day Xuancheng, Anhui) with less than 1,000 men. Out of negligence, Sun Quan did not set up defence posts, so when thousands of bandits suddenly attacked Xuancheng, he attempted to flee. However, by then, Sun Quan had already been surrounded by the bandits, who attacked him and slashed at <b>his</b> <b>saddle,</b> causing much panic among his men. Only Zhou Tai, with his spirits roused, rushed to protect Sun Quan, emboldening those near him and making them able to fight again. When the bandits finally dispersed, Zhou Tai had sustained 12 deep wounds all over his body and he {{took a long time to}} recover. If Zhou Tai was not there on that day, Sun Quan would have surely perished. Zhou Tai's act of bravery was greatly appreciated by Sun Ce, who appointed him as the Chief (é•·) of Chungu County (æ˜¥ç©€ç¸£; northwest of present-day Fanchang County, Anhui).|$|E
60|$|That night Stockton tied me securely, {{but in a}} {{way which}} made it easy for me to turn. I slept soundly and awoke late. When I sat up Stockton stood by <b>his</b> <b>saddled</b> horse, and was giving orders to the men. He spoke sharply. He {{made it clear that they}} were not to be lax in their vigilance. Then, without a word to Dick or me, he rode down the gorge and {{disappeared}} behind a corner of yellow wall.|$|R

500|$|On May 8, 1890, {{southeast}} of Tucson, Arizona Territory, Empire Ranch owner Walter Vail captured {{and thought he}} had killed a Gila monster. He tied it to <b>his</b> <b>saddle</b> and it bit the middle finger {{of his right hand}} and wouldn't let go. A ranch hand pried open the lizard's mouth with a pocketknife, cut open his finger to stimulate bleeding, and then tied saddle strings around his finger and wrist. They summoned Dr. John C. Handy of Tucson, who took Vail back to Tucson for treatment, but Vail experienced swollen and bleeding [...] glands in his throat for sometime afterward.|$|E
500|$|As Marko matured, {{he became}} headstrong; VukaÅ¡in {{once said that}} he had no control over his son, who went {{wherever}} he wanted, drank and brawled. Marko grew up into a large, strong man, with a terrifying appearance, which was also somewhat comical. He wore a wolf-skin cap pulled low over his dark eyes, his black moustache {{was the size of a}} six-month-old lamb and his cloak was a shaggy wolf-pelt. A Damascus sabre swung at his waist, and a spear was slung across his back. Marko's pernach weighed 66okas (...) and hung on the left side of <b>his</b> <b>saddle,</b> balanced by a well-filled wineskin on the saddle's right side. His grip was strong enough to squeeze drops of water from a piece of dry cornel wood. Marko defeated a succession of champions against overwhelming odds.|$|E
500|$|As the Battle of Churubusco approached, Scott ordered Pierce to {{the rear}} to convalesce. He responded, [...] "For God's sake, General, {{this is the last}} great battle, and I must lead my brigade." [...] Scott yielded, and Pierce entered the fight tied to <b>his</b> <b>saddle,</b> but the pain in his leg became so great that he passed out on the field. The Americans won the battle and Pierce helped {{negotiate}} an armistice. He then returned to command and led his brigade {{throughout the rest of the}} campaign, eventually taking part in the capture of Mexico City in mid-September, although his brigade was held in reserve for much of the battle. He spent much of Mexico City fight in the sick tent, plagued with acute diarrhea. Pierce remained in command of his brigade during the three-month occupation of the city, while frustrated with the stalling of peace negotiations, and tried to distance himself from the constant conflict between Scott and the other generals.|$|E
50|$|Williams {{learned his}} leatherworking skills from a {{horseman}} called Dollar Mick, making bridles, pack saddles and riding boots. In 1932, with his son's illness and {{the expense of}} hospital treatment, he {{was in need of}} money and began selling <b>his</b> <b>saddles</b> to Sir Sidney Kidman (a wealthy pastoralist). Williams soon had a small factory running in his father's back shed in Adelaide that rapidly expanded. To address financial problems, he became involved with the Nobles Nob gold mine, near Tennant Creek in the Northern Territory.|$|R

500|$|Virtually {{nothing is}} known about Sviatoslav's {{childhood}} and youth, which he spent reigning in Novgorod. Sviatoslav's father, Igor, was killed by the Drevlians around 945, and his mother, Olga, ruled as regent in Kiev until Sviatoslav reached maturity (ca. 963). Sviatoslav was tutored by a Varangian named Asmud. The tradition of employing Varangian tutors for the sons of ruling princes survived well into the 11th century. Sviatoslav appears to have had little patience for administration. His life was spent with his druzhina (roughly, [...] "company") in permanent warfare against neighboring states. According to the Primary Chronicle, he carried on his expeditions neither wagons nor kettles, and he boiled no meat, rather cutting off small strips of horseflesh, game, or beef to eat after roasting it on the coals. Nor {{did he have a}} tent, rather spreading out a horse-blanket under him and setting <b>his</b> <b>saddle</b> under his head, and all his retinue did likewise.|$|E
500|$|While his adjutants {{were trying}} to wake Frederick, his generals, most of whom had not slept and had kept their horses saddled and weapons ready, {{organized}} the Prussian resistance. Keith had anticipated an Austrian attack and organized a slashing counterattack on the Austrians holding the Prussian battery. Maurice von Anhalt-Dessau, another of Frederick's able generals, funneled the awakening troops to Keith. Combined, this action briefly retook the Prussian battery south of Hochkirch, {{but they could not}} hold it in the face of Austrian muskets. At 6:00, three more Prussian regiments rushed Hochkirch itself, while Prince Maurice continued directing stragglers and reinforcements into the counterattack. [...] The Prussians swept through the village, out the other side, and fell on the battery at bayonet point. By that point, though, most Prussian order and cohesion had been lost. The Austrians, supported by their appropriated Prussian guns, which had not been spiked, wrought havoc on the attackers. Keith was hit mid-body and knocked out of <b>his</b> <b>saddle,</b> dead as he fell.|$|E
500|$|On March 3, 1847, Pierce was {{promoted}} to brigadier general, and took command of a brigade of reinforcements for General Scott's army, with Ransom succeeding to command of the regiment. Needing time to assemble his brigade, Pierce reached the already-seized port of Vera Cruz in late June, where he prepared a march of 2,500 men accompanying supplies to take to Scott. The three-week journey inland was perilous, and the men fought off several attacks before joining with Scott's army in early August, {{in time for the}} Battle of Contreras. The battle was disastrous for Pierce: his horse was suddenly startled during a charge, knocking him groin-first against <b>his</b> <b>saddle.</b> The horse then tripped into a crevice and fell, pinning Pierce underneath and leaving him with a debilitating knee injury. The incident made it look like he had fainted, causing one soldier to call for someone else to take command, [...] "General Pierce is a damned coward." [...] Pierce returned for the following day's action, but again injured his knee, forcing him to hobble after his men, {{and by the time he}} caught up, the battle had mostly been won.|$|E
