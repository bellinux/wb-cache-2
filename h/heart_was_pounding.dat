6000|$|... 'Somebody {{ran past}} me.' I hardly heard her. My <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> <b>pounding,</b> and a curious {{dizziness}} {{had come over}} me. I was grappling with the incredible. 'I think {{he went into the}} bushes.' ...|$|E
6000|$|While {{the names}} which preceded mine were called off that first afternoon, I grew colder and colder till at last I shook with a nervous chill, and when, in his smooth, {{pleasant}} tenor, Prof. Bush called out [...] "Hamlin Garland" [...] I rose {{in my seat}} with a spring like Jack from his box. My limbs were numb, so numb that I could scarcely feel the floor beneath my feet and the windows were only faint gray glares of light. My head oscillated like a toy balloon, seemed indeed to be floating in the air, and my <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> <b>pounding</b> like a drum.|$|E
60|$|If ever a man {{deliberately}} committed murder, Al Hutchins {{did that}} morning in solitary at the Warden's bidding. He robbed me of the little space I stole. And, having robbed me of that, my body was defenceless, and, with his foot in my back while he drew the lacing light, he constricted me as no man had ever before succeeded in doing. So severe was this constriction of my frail frame upon my vital organs that I felt, there and then, immediately, that death was upon me. And still the miracle of faith was mine. I {{did not believe that}} I was going to die. I knew--I say I knew--that I was not going to die. My head was swimming, and my <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> <b>pounding</b> from my toenails to the hair-roots in my scalp.|$|E
6000|$|She thrust {{her hand}} under {{his coat and}} laid it over his <b>heart.</b> [...] "You <b>are</b> tired out," [...] she said, and there was anguish in her voice. [...] "Your <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> <b>pounding</b> terribly. You mustn't do any more climbing. And, hark, there's a wolf!" ...|$|R

60|$|Hanscom smiled. He {{had seen}} other women hurrying {{to change their}} workaday dress for visitors, and he {{imagined}} Helen hastily putting on her shoes and smoothing her hair. He was distinctly less in awe of her by reason of this girlish action--it made her seem more of his own rough-and-ready world, and he dismounted at her door almost at his ease, although his <b>heart</b> had <b>been</b> <b>pounding</b> furiously as he rode down the ridge.|$|R
60|$|The pursuit was renewed, {{till the}} water was again muddied. But he could not wait. He unstrapped the tin bucket and began to bale the pool. He baled wildly at first, {{splashing}} himself and flinging the water so short a distance that it ran back into the pool. He worked more carefully, striving to be cool, though his <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> <b>pounding</b> against his chest and his hands were trembling. At the end of half an hour the pool was nearly dry. Not a cupful of water remained. And there was no fish. He found a hidden crevice among the stones through which it had escaped to the adjoining and larger pool--a pool which he could not empty in a night and a day. Had he known of the crevice, he could have closed it with a rock {{at the beginning and}} the fish would have been his.|$|E
60|$|When she {{returned}} with the grammar, she drew a chair near his--he wondered if he should have helped her with the chair--and sat down beside him. She turned {{the pages of the}} grammar, and their heads were inclined toward each other. He could hardly follow her outlining of the work he must do, so amazed was he by her delightful propinquity. But when she began to lay down the importance of conjugation, he forgot all about her. He had never heard of conjugation, and was fascinated by the glimpse he was catching into the tie-ribs of language. He leaned closer to the page, and her hair touched his cheek. He had fainted but once in his life, and he {{thought he was going to}} faint again. He could scarcely breathe, and his <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> <b>pounding</b> the blood up into his throat and suffocating him. Never had she seemed so accessible as now. For the moment the great gulf that separated them was bridged. But there was no diminution in the loftiness of his feeling for her. She had not descended to him. It was he who had been caught up into the clouds and carried to her. His reverence for her, in that moment, was of the same order as religious awe and fervor. It seemed to him that he had intruded upon the holy of holies, and slowly and carefully he moved his head aside from the contact which thrilled him like an electric shock and of which she had not been aware.|$|E
6000|$|... "Move on!" [...] he said brutally. [...] "Move on, or I'll roil you in." [...] And Janet, once {{clear of}} the people, fled westward, the words the {{foreigner}} had spoken ringing in her ears. She found herself repeating them aloud, [...] "Kill Ditmar!" [...] as she hurried through the gathering dusk past the power house with its bottle-shaped chimneys, and crossed the little bridge over the stream beside the chocolate factory. She gained the avenue she had trod with Eda on that summer day of the circus. Here was the ragpicker's shop, the fence covered with bedraggled posters, the deserted grand-stand of the base-ball park spread with a milky-blue mantle of snow; and beyond, the monotonous frame cottages all built from one model. Now she descried looming above her the outline of Torrey's Hill blurred and melting into a darkening sky, and turned into the bleak lane where stood the Franco-Belgian Hall--Hampton Headquarters of the Industrial Workers of the World. She halted a moment at sight of the crowd of strikers loitering in front of it, then went on again, mingling with them excitedly beside the little building. Its lines were simple and unpretentious, and yet it had an exotic character all its own, differing strongly from the surrounding houses: {{it might have been}} transported from a foreign country and set down here. As the home of that odd, cooperative society of thrifty and gregarious Belgians it had stimulated her imagination, and once before she had gazed, as now, through the yellowed, lantern-like windows of the little store at the women and children waiting to fill their baskets with the day's provisions. In the middle of the building was an entrance leading up to the second floor. Presently she gathered the courage to enter. Her <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> <b>pounding</b> as she climbed the dark stairs and thrust open the door, and she stood a moment on the threshold almost choked by the fumes of tobacco, bewildered by the scene within, confused by the noise. Through a haze of smoke she beheld groups of swarthy foreigners fiercely disputing among themselves--apparently on the verge of actual combat, while a sprinkling of silent spectators of both sexes stood {{at the back of the}} hall. At the far end was a stage, still set with painted, sylvan scenery, and seated there, alone, above the confusion and the strife, with a calmness, a detachment almost disconcerting, was a stout man with long hair and a loose black tie. He was smoking a cigar and reading a newspaper which he presently flung down, taking up another from a pile on the table beside him. Suddenly one of the groups, shouting and gesticulating, surged toward him and made an appeal through their interpreter. He did not appear to be listening; without so much as lowering his newspaper he spoke a few words in reply, and the group retired, satisfied. By some incomprehensible power he dominated. Panting, fascinated, loath to leave yet fearful, Janet watched him, breathing now deeply this atmosphere of smoke, of strife, and turmoil. She found it grateful, for the strike, the battle was in her own soul as well. Momentarily she had forgotten Rolfe, who had been in her mind as she had come hither, and then she caught sight of him in a group in the centre of the hall. He saw her, he was making his way toward her, he was holding her hands, looking down into her face with that air of appropriation, of possession she remembered. But she felt no resentment now, only a fierce exultation at having dared.|$|E
60|$|He {{was still}} trying to become acquainted with his own voice. He hobbled across the floor and leant against the bar. He knew he must lie consistently; and while he {{maintained}} an appearance of careless indifference, his <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> beating and <b>pounding</b> furiously and irregularly, and he could not help looking hungrily at the three men by the stove. They were the possessors of life--his life.|$|R
40|$|I 2 ̆ 7 ve dashed into {{a coffee}} shop and ordered my {{take-away}} flat white. While waiting I observe {{a group of three}} mothers sitting outdoors with prams carefully arranged not to obstruct the flow of customers, enjoying a coffee and chat with babes in arms. One mum is patiently wrestling with her about 1 -month old baby trying to latch him to breastfeed, while the others watch sympathetically, offering support and advice. 2 ̆ 7 He always fusses like this. Sometimes it takes 5 minutes to get him on and by then he 2 ̆ 7 s lost the plot. Being somewhere different seems to make him worse 2 ̆ 7. 2 ̆ 7 Have you had him checked for tongue-tie? 2 ̆ 7 one mother asks knowingly. I listen in, deliberately eavesdropping now. 2 ̆ 7 Yes, the Child Health Nurse had a look but said his mouth is quite normal and the fussing is just his impatience to get the food 2 ̆ 7. She popped a dummy in the baby 2 ̆ 7 s mouth and he calmed down temporarily. My coffee is ready and I sit down for a few sips. 2 ̆ 7 My friend 2 ̆ 7 s baby needed a release for a tongue-tie which many health professionals missed but the chiropractor found. Maybe you should take him to a chiropractor? 2 ̆ 7 The baby squawks spitting out the dummy, and the mother firmly lays his flailing arms across his chest trying valiantly to latch him again. At this point I cannot resist getting involved too, my <b>heart</b> <b>is</b> <b>pounding</b> as I introduce myself as an international board certified lactation consultant (IBCLC) 2 ̆ 7 Gosh you 2 ̆ 7 re having a battle there. can I offer a suggestion? 2 ̆ 7 All three pairs of eyes look astonished at my bold intervention, but she gladly agrees 2 ̆ 7 Yes, whatever can help 2 ̆ 7. I verbally guide her to position her baby differently - his hip towards her hip, arms either side of her breast, his chest snuggling in contact with her own and holding him only over his shoulders allowing his head to fall back. She resists allowing his head to be free but complies as his chin rests at the base of her areola. Baby gapes widely and spontaneously latches as my hand supports her hand on his shoulders to maintain a secure hold. The expression on her face tells me she is greatly relieved. 2 ̆ 7 It doesn 2 ̆ 7 t hurt, 2 ̆ 7 she says with a look of disbelief as she stares at me, smiling. 2 ̆ 7 Great, remember what you and your baby have just done. Keep going. You are doing a fantastic job! 2 ̆ 7...|$|R

That morning I happened to spear a grouper. A strong and combative grouper. On the bottom a real titanic struggle broke out, between me who wanted to take its life and the grouper who tried to save itself. The grouper was caught in a cavity between two rocks; trying to understand its position, I ran my right hand down the fish's belly. Its <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> <b>pounding</b> in terror, mad with fear. And with that pulsing of blood I realized that I was killing a living being.

5000|$|By late autumn, Susumu Yano {{had retired}} and Screen Hero entered the stable of the first-season trainer Yuichi Shikato. On 9 November he was ridden by Masayoshi Ebina when he contested the Copa Republica Argentina, a Grade II {{handicap}} race over 2500 metres at Tokyo. The colt recorded his first win at Graded level {{as he came}} home {{one and a half}} lengths clear of Jaguar Mail with Al Nasrain a neck away in third.On 30 November Screen Hero contested the 28th running of the Japan Cup in front of a 102,567 crowd at Tokyo and started a 40/1 outsider in a seventeen-runner field. Before the race Shikato commented [...] "He's getting better with each race. He knows how to race, so I'm not particularly concerned about the draw. We're challengers here". The Tokyo Yushun winner Deep Sky started favourite ahead of the outstanding racemare Vodka. The overseas challenge was provided by the three British runners Papal Bull (King Edward VII Stakes, Princess of Wales's Stakes), Sixties Icon (St Leger) and Purple Moon (Ebor Handicap, runner-up in the Melbourne Cup). The other Japanese runners included Meisho Samson (Satsuki Sho, Tokyo Yushun, Tenno Sho), Oken Bruce Lee (Kikuka Sho), Asakusa Kings (Kikuka Sho) and Matsurida Gogh (Arima Kinen). Ridden by the Italian jockey Mirco Demuro Screen Hero tracked the leaders as the outsider Never Bouchon set a slow pace. Matsurida Gogh took the lead in the straight but Screen Hero produced a powerful late run to take the lead 150 metres from the post. In a blanket finish he won by half a length, three quarters of a length, a head and a neck from Deep Sky, Vodka, Matsurida Gogh and Oken Bruce Lee. After the race Demuro said [...] "We had decided to mark Matsurida Gogh as he always gets a nice position. The only thing I had been concerned about was the start, but he broke well and the slow pace meant we could move in and get a good position easily... he is a very competitive horse. When he lines up with other horses, he really battles to stay ahead of them". Shikato commented [...] "My <b>heart</b> <b>was</b> just <b>pounding</b> until he <b>was</b> over the finish line... With each race he seemed to rise to meet the level of his opponents".|$|R
