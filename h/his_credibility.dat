5|$|In July 2012, Romney {{visited the}} United Kingdom, Israel, and Poland, meeting leaders {{in an effort}} to raise <b>his</b> <b>credibility</b> as a world statesman. Comments Romney made about the {{readiness}} of the 2012 Summer Olympics were perceived as undiplomatic by the British press. Israeli Prime Minister (and former BCG colleague) Benjamin Netanyahu, embraced Romney, though some Palestinians criticized him for suggesting that Israel's culture led to their greater economic success.|$|E
5|$|U.S. {{officials}} said that the CIA conducted a review of intelligence supplied by al-Balawi, examining whether he supplied false information about U.S. successes amid valid data used to establish <b>his</b> <b>credibility.</b> The investigation included a review of a list of senior al Qaeda and Taliban operatives reported killed in U.S. drone strikes since January 2009. The National Counterterrorism Center conducted its own review of the intelligence al-Balawi provided, two {{officials said}}.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the extant}} {{information}} about {{the last few days}} of Poe's life comes from his attending physician, Dr. John Joseph Moran, though <b>his</b> <b>credibility</b> is questionable. Poe was buried after a small funeral at the back of Westminster Hall and Burying Ground, but his remains were moved to a new grave with a larger monument in 1875. The newer monument also marks the burial place of Poe's wife, Virginia, and his mother-in-law, Maria. Theories as to what caused Poe's death include suicide, murder, cholera, hypoglycemia, rabies, syphilis, influenza, and that Poe was a victim of cooping. Evidence of the influence of alcohol is strongly disputed.|$|E
5000|$|That {{is the way}} Schweitzer {{conducted}} his theological refutation. He did not try {{to deliver}} a [...] "hit" [...] or a knock-out impact, but to gradually undermine <b>his</b> opponents' <b>credibility.</b> <b>His</b> interpretations only expressed his own opinions as an expert scholar, while his targets were not automatically [...] "convinced". The debate simply rebounded and kept going after the 2d. edition of 1913.|$|R
25|$|Bhumibol biographer Paul Handley, in The King Never Smiles, {{writes that}} the {{dictator}} Sarit was Bhumibol's tool. Political scientist Thak Chaloemtiarana writes that Sarit used Bhumibol {{in order to build}} <b>his</b> own <b>credibility.</b>|$|R

5|$|Demosthenes {{relied heavily}} on the {{difference}} aspects of ethos, especially phronesis. When presenting himself to the Assembly, he had to depict himself as a credible and wise statesman and adviser {{in order to be}} persuasive. One tactic that Demosthenes used during his philippics was foresight. He pleaded with his audience to predict the potential of being defeated, and to prepare. He appealed to pathos through patriotism and introducing the atrocities that would befall Athens if it was taken over by Philip. He was a master at “self-fashioning” by referring to his previous accomplishments, and renewing <b>his</b> <b>credibility.</b> He would also slyly undermine his audience by claiming that they had been wrong to not listen before, however they could redeem themselves if they listened and acted with him presently.|$|E
5|$|The armies met on 21 June in Lochaber and Alexander, {{suffering}} the defection of Clan Chattan (the MacKintoshes) and Clan Cameron, was heavily defeated. Alexander escaped probably to Islay but James continued his {{assault on the}} Lordship by taking the strongholds of Dingwall and Urquhart castles in July. The king pushed home his advantage when an army reinforced with artillery was dispatched to the isles. Alexander probably realised that his position was hopeless and tried to negotiate terms of surrender but James demanded and received his total submission. From August 1429 the king delegated royal authority to Alexander Stewart, Earl of Mar for the keeping of the peace {{in the north and}} west. The Islesmen rose again in September 1431 and inflicted two important defeats on the king's men – Mar's army was beaten at Inverlochy and Angus Moray's in a fierce battle near Tongue in Caithness. This was a serious setback for James and <b>his</b> <b>credibility</b> was adversely affected. In 1431, before the September uprising, the king had arrested two of his nephews, John Kennedy of Carrick and Archibald, Earl of Douglas possibly {{as a result of a}} conflict between John and his uncle, Thomas Kennedy in which Douglas may have become involved. Douglas's arrest had raised tensions in the country and James acted to reduce the unrest by freeing the earl on 29 September – it was quite likely that the king made the earl's release conditional on support at the forthcoming parliament at Perth at which James intended to push for further funding for the campaign against the Lordship. Parliament was in no mood to allow James unconditional backing – he was allowed a tax to fund his Highland campaign but parliament retained full control over the levy. The rules parliament attached to the taxation indicated a robust stand against further conflict in the north and probably led to the turnaround that took place on 22 October when the king 'forgave the offence of each earl, namely Douglas and Ross '. For Douglas this was a formal acknowledgement of his having already been freed three weeks earlier but for Alexander this was a total reversal of crown policy towards the Lordship. Four summer campaigns against the Lordship were now officially at an end with James's wishes having effectively been blocked by parliament.|$|E

5|$|Priestley's {{attempts}} to avoid political {{controversy in the}} United States failed. In 1794, the journalist William Cobbett published Observations on the Emigration of Dr. Joseph Priestley, which falsely accused Priestley of stirring up rebellion in Britain, and attempted to undermine <b>his</b> scientific <b>credibility.</b> <b>His</b> political fortunes took an even worse turn when Cobbett obtained a set of letters sent to Priestley by the radical printer John Hurford Stone and the liberal novelist Helen Maria Williams. Cobbett published the letters in his newspaper, asserting that Priestley {{and his friends were}} fomenting a revolution. Priestley was eventually forced to defend himself in print.|$|R

5000|$|At a {{personal}} level his nickname of [...] "the Vulcan" [...] reached prominence and much lampooning in the media, whilst his formal launch of his campaign was dismissed {{as a collection of}} all the mavericks on the right of the party, widely undermining <b>his</b> bid's <b>credibility.</b>|$|R

25|$|According to Nina Easton, Abramoff gained much of <b>his</b> <b>credibility</b> in the {{conservative}} movement through his father, Franklin Abramoff. As president of Diners Club International, Abramoff's father worked closely with Alfred S. Bloomingdale, a personal friend of Ronald Reagan.|$|E
25|$|While King Louis XVI still enjoyed {{popularity}} among the population, his disastrous flight to Varennes (June 1791) seemed to justify rumours he had tied his hopes of political salvation to {{the prospects of}} foreign invasion. <b>His</b> <b>credibility</b> was so deeply undermined that {{the abolition of the}} monarchy and establishment of a republic became an increasing possibility.|$|E
50|$|A lot of {{time also}} goes into {{describing}} N.W.H.'s feud with another rap group, the Jam Boys. The groups constantly insult and discredit each other, even sometimes resulting in brandishing weapons. At one point, N.W.H. brings to light evidence that the Jam Boys' lead rapper attended a prep school, directly threatening <b>his</b> street <b>credibility.</b>|$|R
5000|$|According to Geoffrey Lawrence, deputy policy {{director}} at the Nevada Policy Research Institute, Bundy lost <b>his</b> personal <b>credibility</b> with <b>his</b> racist remarks.

50|$|In 1973, Mairaj {{fell out}} with the Bhutto {{government}} when Bhutto started to compromise on his so-called Socialist agenda and the regime resorted to repressive measures.

25|$|Now the {{commission}} is attempting to remove Siebert and destroy <b>his</b> <b>credibility.</b> It delayed Siebert's administrative hearing until after the new year, but has refused a request from District 14 to delay {{the appointment of a}} medical examiner until after the hearing. It appears that technicalities are acceptable only when {{the commission}} uses them.|$|E
25|$|Tom Brinkman's {{opposition}} to almost everything undercuts <b>his</b> <b>credibility,</b> {{and does a}} disservice to both the district and the region. His reflexive {{opposition to}} much government spending, his willingness to tolerate a tattered social services safety net, his advocacy of an entirely unregulated concealed carry gun permit system, we submit, are out of step even with such a thoroughly Republican constituency.|$|E
25|$|Before {{and after}} Clarke {{appeared}} before the 9/11 Commission, some critics tried to attack <b>his</b> <b>credibility,</b> launching a full-scale offensive against him: impugning his personal motives, claiming he was a disappointed job-hunter, that he sought publicity, {{and that he was}} a political partisan. They charged that he exaggerated perceived failures in the Bush administration's counterterrorism policies while exculpating the former Clinton administration from its perceived shortcomings.|$|E

25|$|Bhumibol's {{refusal to}} endorse {{military}} coups in 1981 (the April Fool's Day coup) and 1985 (the Share Rebellion) {{ultimately led to}} the victory of forces loyal to the government, despite some violence – including, in 1981, the seizure of Bangkok by rebel forces. The coups led many to believe that Bhumibol had misjudged Thai society and that <b>his</b> <b>credibility</b> as an impartial mediator between various political and military factions had been compromised.|$|E
25|$|After one {{match with}} Clive Allen and Alex Inglethorpe in charge, Juande Ramos {{was hired as}} Jol's replacement, having {{previously}} managed Sevilla. Alongside Ramos, Gus Poyet was handed the assistant head coaching role. Marcos Álvarez, who worked alongside Ramos at Sevilla, also joined the backroom staff, as fitness coach. Tottenham chairman Daniel Levy was widely criticised for his treatment of Jol following revelations that Ramos was approached to replace Jol during the summer, which many thought undermined his leadership and ruined <b>his</b> <b>credibility</b> as an authoritative figure.|$|E

25|$|However, Maehara's term {{as party}} leader lasted barely half a year. Although he {{initially}} led the party's {{criticism of the}} Koizumi administration, particularly in regards to connections between LDP lawmakers and scandal-ridden Livedoor, the revelation that a fake email was used to try and establish this link greatly damaged <b>his</b> <b>credibility.</b> The scandal led to the resignation of Representative Hisayasu Nagata and of Maehara as party leader on 31 March. New elections for party leader were held on 7 April, in which Ichirō Ozawa was elected President. In Upper House election 2007, the DPJ won 60 out of 121 contested seats, with 49 seats not up for re-election.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors in the trial was the testimony of Tommaso Buscetta, the first ever Sicilian Mafiosi boss to become an informant (pentito). His assertion that the Mafia was not a collection of separate gangs but a single organisation led some magistrates and detectives to question <b>his</b> <b>credibility.</b> After an interview, Falcone became convinced that Buscetta was genuine and treated him with respect. Buscetta's key revelation was that a governing council, known as the Commission or Cupula headed a collective structure, thereby establishing that the top tier of Mafia members were complicit in all the organisation's crimes. This premise became known as the Buscetta theorem.|$|E
25|$|Returning 14 issues later, Hank Pym {{participates in}} several {{missions}} until, after demonstrating hostile behavior toward Janet van Dyne, he attacks a foe from behind once the opponent had ceased fighting. Captain America suspends Yellowjacket from Avengers duty pending {{the verdict of}} a court-martial. Pym suffers a mental breakdown and concocts a plan to salvage <b>his</b> <b>credibility</b> by building a robot, Salvation-1, and programming it to launch {{an attack on the}} Avengers that he will stop using the robot’s weakness at the critical moment, in hopes of regaining his good standing. The Wasp discovers the plan and begs Pym to stop, whereupon he strikes her. Jim Shooter, the writer of this story, says he intended only that Pym accidentally strike her while gesturing at her dismissively, and that artist Bob Hall misinterpreted. Pym is subsequently expelled from the Avengers, and Janet divorces him.|$|E
