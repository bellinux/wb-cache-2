2500|$|Current satellite-based sensors are not {{designed}} to meet the accuracy requirements needed for climate change detection. Many sensors used for climate measurements were designed to meet operational weather needs and are not optimized for climate sampling. [...] These sensors, along with older instruments designed for climate, lack the on-board ability to test for systematic errors on orbit. The CLARREO mission will meet these goals through careful consideration of the instrument design, calibration traceability at all stages of development and operation, with spectral, spatial and temporal sampling focused specifically on the creation of climate records. Then after development of new cross-calibration methodologies far more accurate than those achieved today, CLARREO may serve as an in-orbit standard to provide reference intercalibration for missions like the broadband Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES), operational sounders including the Cross-track Infrared Sounder (CrIS) and Infrared Atmospheric Sounding Interferometer (IASI), and imagers such as the Visible Infrared <b>Imaging</b> <b>Radiometer</b> Suite (VIIRS) and Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer (AVHRR).|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Miguel Román, is a {{research}} physical scientist with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). A major focus of Román's work is the quantiﬁcation of uncertainty in long-term satellite measurements of the Earth's surface at both moderate and high spatial resolutions. Román has developed a [...] combination of global quality assessment and validation techniques that include visible, near-infrared, and multi-angular imagery and measurements acquired from in-situ and airborne platforms. His efforts to improve narrowband reflectance anisotropy models to estimate the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) of land surfaces have led to major advancements in the estimation of terrestrial essential climate variables routinely used to monitor human activity and natural disturbances from satellite platforms. As a lead member of the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) and Visible Infrared <b>Imaging</b> <b>Radiometer</b> Suite (VIIRS) Land Discipline teams, Román's research has enabled scientists to quantify {{how much of the}} variations in satellite observations are due to sensor performance, terrain, and/or geometry (view angle) effects; a critical factor when the satellite data are used to [...] drive policy related to global climate change. Most recently, Dr. Román’s research has focused on capturing seasonal variations in nighttime lights using measurements from the VIIRS Day/Night Band on Suomi-NPP.|$|E

40|$|Observations of {{sunlight}} reflected from regions of sun glint {{are used to}} check the relative calibration of spectral radiances obtained with <b>imaging</b> <b>radiometers.</b> Reflectances at different wavelengths for sun-glint regions are linearly related. Provided that the atmosphere is reasonably transparent at the wavelengths, the aerosol burden is reasonably light, 0. 64 -m optical depth less than 0. 2; the particles constituting the aerosol are reasonably large, {{as is the case}} for marine aerosols; and the solar zenith angle is less than about 35 °, the linear relationships between reflectances at different wavelengths are rather insensitive to the factors that govern the reflectances themselves. The relationships are remarkably insensitive to atmospheric composi-tion, surface wind speed and direction, illumination, and viewing geometry. The slopes and offsets of the linear relationships are used to assess the relative accuracies of the calibrations of the different channels. Such assessments would appear to be attractive for checks on the in-flight performance of aircraft-borne <b>imaging</b> <b>radiometers.</b> Here, observations of reflectances at 0. 64, 0. 84, 1. 6, and 2. 1 m for regions of sun glint obtained with the Terra and Aqua Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instruments are shown to be consistent with each other.

40|$|Satellite radar {{interferometry}} (InSAR) can {{be applied}} to study vertically integrated atmospheric refractivity variations with a spatial resolution of 20 m and an accuracy of 2 mm, irrespective of cloud cover or solar illumination. The data are derived from the difference between the radar signal delay variations within the imaged area during two acquisitions with a temporal separation of one or more days. Hence, they reflect the superposition of the refractivity distribution during these two acquisitions. On short spatial scales integrated refractivity variations are dominantly caused by spatial heterogeneities in the water vapor distribution. Validation of the radar interferometric results can be difficult since conventional <b>imaging</b> <b>radiometers</b> do not provide quantitative measures for water vapor content over the entire tropospheric column and lack in spatial resolution.

40|$|Electronic beam {{steering}} capability of {{phased array antenna}} systems offer significant advantages when used in real aperture <b>imaging</b> <b>radiometers.</b> The sensitivity of such systems {{is limited by the}} ability to accurately calibrate variations in the antenna circuit characteristics. Passive antenna systems, which require mechanical rotation to scan the beam, have stable characteristics and the noise figure of the antenna can be characterized with knowledge of its physical temperature [1],[2]. Phased array antenna systems provide the ability to electronically steer the beam in any desired direction. Such antennas make use of active components (amplifiers, phase shifters) to provide electronic scanning capability while maintaining a low antenna noise figure. The gain fluctuations in the active components can be significant, resulting in substantial calibration difficulties [3]. In this paper, we introduce two novel calibration techniques that provide an end-to-end calibration of a real-aperture, phased array radiometer system. Empirical data will be shown to illustrate the performance of both methods...|$|R
