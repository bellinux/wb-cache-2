5000|$|Small clubs, {{bars and}} coffeehouses use a fairly simple set-up, with large Front of <b>House</b> <b>{{speakers}}</b> and subwoofers {{aimed at the}} audience, and smaller monitor speakers aimed back at the performers {{so that they can}} hear their vocals and instruments. In many cases, the Front of <b>House</b> <b>speakers</b> are elevated, either by mounting them on poles or by [...] "flying" [...] them from anchors in the ceiling. The Front of <b>House</b> <b>speakers</b> are elevated to prevent the sound from being absorbed by the first few rows of audience members. The subwoofers {{do not need to be}} elevated, because deep bass is omnidirectional. In the smallest coffeehouses and bars, the audio mixer may be onstage so that the performers can mix their own sound levels. In larger bars, the audio mixer may be located in or behind the audience seating area, so that an audio engineer can listen to the mix and adjust the sound levels. The adjustments to the monitor speaker mix may be made by a single audio engineer using the main mixing board, or they may be made by a second audio engineer who uses a separate mixing board.|$|R

5|$|Critics say the MFP formula discourages {{high levels}} of local, rather than state, funding.

Tulane University's Cowen Institute was founded in 2007 to examine the effects of local tax initiatives on the MFP. Tara O'Neill, Cowen Institute Policy Manager, said districts receive extra incentive funding from the state when they raise high amounts of funding at the local level. O'Neill said districts get this extra money whether they tax a low tax base at a high rate or tax a healthy tax base at a low rate.|$|E
