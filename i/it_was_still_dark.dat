5|$|The {{assault was}} under the direct command of Major-General Essad Pasha. The plan was to gather the assault force {{secretly}} behind the Turkish lines on 18 May. Then at 03:30 19 May, while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>dark,</b> the Turkish forces would simultaneously attack all along the ANZAC perimeter. The aim was to force the defenders out of their trenches {{and back into the}} sea. To maintain surprise the attack would not be preceded by an artillery bombardment; but the previous day all the available Turkish artillery bombarded the ANZAC lines between 17:00 and midnight. This was something they had done twice before that month. The signal to start the attack {{was supposed to have been}} the detonation of a large mine at Quinn's Post, in the centre of the ANZAC lines, but by 19 May the tunnel for the mine had not been completed. The attacking force, from north to south, comprised the 19th Division (now made up of the 27th, 57th and 72nd Infantry Regiments), 5th Division (13th and 14th Infantry Regiments), 2nd Division (1st, 5th and 6th Infantry Regiments), 16th Division (33rd, 47th, 48th and 125th Infantry Regiments) and the now independent 77th Infantry Regiment. In total this was around 42,000 men. The 2nd and 16th Divisions were fresh, having just arrived on the peninsula, while the other two had taken part in some of the previous counter-attacks at Anzac Cove.|$|E
25|$|The {{landings}} {{went ahead}} unopposed and the commandos {{moved to the}} various objectives, that had been identified by intelligence. Little damage was done {{as a number of}} the targets proved not to exist or were not where they were thought to be. One party was able to damage a bridge, while another set a tyre dump on fire and blew up the breeches of a number of naval guns. Due to the delays during the landings and the need to depart while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>dark,</b> time ran out and the commandos were forced to withdraw. On the way back, an officer was shot when he failed to respond correctly when challenged by a sentry, while 67 men, not knowing that there were no assault craft at their beach due to the earlier error, were left behind and later captured.|$|E
25|$|When the two {{submarines}} arrived {{they were}} off Mendoza Island (now Shenggao Island) {{at the entrance of}} the bay. The two then split up, L4 went to patrol around the entrance of the bay and Halahan ordered L5 to patrol within. Bias Bay is surrounded by rocks and that night there was a fleet of fishing junks sheltering inside and constantly moving around the anchorage. Both the rocks and the junks made it difficult for the British to monitor the area without being detected though they succeeded in doing so and on the morning of 20 October they encountered the Irene steaming off Cake Island. She had been taken over by at least eighteen pirates armed with automatic pistols. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>dark</b> so the L4 was surface cruising with a crew at the 4-inch (102-mm) gun and another pair at the vessel's searchlight. Lieutenant Halahan knew that torpedoes were not helpful in recapturing a pirate held ship but he did have a 4-inch (102-mm) deck gun. Then the Irene was spotted so Halahan maneuvered his submarine into position for firing and when the order was given, the search light was turned on and the gun crew fired a blank warning shot at the steamer. When the shot was ignored a second live round was fired and it blew a hole straight through the ship and killed a pirate who was standing on deck.|$|E

25|$|Sometime after 0100, 12 August, 2nd Battalion {{lost contact}} with C Company on the ridge northward and sounds of combat could be heard coming from that area. When further efforts to reach the company by {{telephone}} and radio failed, the battalion commander sent runners and a wire crew out to try to re-establish contact. He then urged speedy movement of the trains and artillery westward through the pass. But the regimental commander reluctantly held firm to division orders not to move until after daylight. The runners returned and {{said they could not}} find the company. The wire crew was missing. Members of the battalion staff had again heard sounds of combat in the company area. They also had seen flares there. This was interpreted to mean that North Korean troops held it and were signaling to allied units. Still unable to contact the division, 5th Infantry now decided to move the trains and artillery out westward while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>dark,</b> despite division orders to wait for daylight, seeing too much risk in delaying any longer. The battalion of the 24th Infantry promised by the division had not arrived. About 0400 the trains to moved out. They were to be followed by the artillery, and then the 1st Battalion would bring up the rear. In the meantime, the battalion was to hold open the pass and protect the regimental column. Movement of the trains through the pass should have been accomplished in twenty minutes, but it required hours. During the hour or more before daylight, no vehicle moved more than ten or twenty feet at a time. One of the factors creating this situation was caused when the Medical Company tried to move into the column from its position near the 1st Battalion command post. An ambulance hung up in a ditch and stopped everything on the road behind it until it could be pulled out.|$|E

Taylor's initial report stated her assailant beat her about the face but did not rape her. Rumors circulated—widely believed by whites in Sumner—that she was both raped and robbed.

500|$|Zero-Hour had {{originally}} been planned for the morning of 8 April (Easter Sunday) but it was postponed 24 hours {{at the request of}} the French, despite reasonably good weather in the assault sector. Zero-Day was rescheduled for 9 April with Zero-Hour at 05:30. The assault was preceded by a hurricane bombardment lasting five minutes, following a relatively quiet night. When the time came, it was snowing heavily; Allied troops advancing across no man's land were hindered by large drifts. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>dark</b> and visibility on the battlefield was very poor. A westerly wind was at the Allied soldiers' backs blowing [...] "a squall of sleet and snow into the faces of the Germans". The combination of the unusual bombardment and poor visibility meant many German troops were caught unawares and taken prisoner, still half-dressed, clambering out of the deep dug-outs of the first two lines of trenches. Others were captured without their boots, trying to escape but stuck in the knee-deep mud of the communication trenches.|$|E
500|$|By 22:30, Droits de l'Homme was {{in severe}} difficulties, with heavy {{casualties}} among her {{crew and passengers}} {{and the loss of}} her mizzenmast to British fire. Observing the battered state of their opponent, Pellew and Reynolds closed on the stern quarters of the French ship, maintaining a high rate of fire that was sporadically returned by Droits de l'Homme. Having exhausted the 4,000 [...] available, Lacrosse was forced to use the shells he was carrying, which had been intended for use by the army in Ireland. In the high winds, these proved even less effective than solid shot, but did drive the frigates to longer range. With their opponent almost immobilised, the British frigates were able to remain outside her arc of fire, effect repairs when necessary and secure guns that had broken loose in the heavy seas. For {{the rest of the night}} the three battered ships remained locked in a close range duel, until suddenly, at 04:20 while <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>dark,</b> land was spotted just [...] to leeward by Lieutenant George Bell of the Indefatigable.|$|E

Since troops were scheduled to land at Utah and Omaha starting at 06:30 (an hour earlier than the British beaches), these areas received only about 40 minutes of naval bombardment before the assault troops began to land on the shore. Some of the landing craft had been modified to provide close support fire, and self-propelled amphibious Duplex-Drive tanks (DD tanks), specially designed for the Normandy landings, were to land shortly before the infantry to provide covering fire. However, few arrived in advance of the infantry, and many sank before reaching the shore, especially at Omaha.|$|E

500|$|On 22 September, {{following}} the 4th Light Horse Brigade's relief by the 5th Light Horse Brigade, the regiment was tasked with escorting 5,000 prisoners to El Lejjun {{before moving to}} Jisr ed Mejamie, along the Jordan River near its confluence with the Sea of Galilee at Lake Tiberias. From there, {{in the early hours}} of 25 September, the 12th Light Horse Regiment, along with the rest of the brigade and one regiment from the 5th Light Horse Brigade, departed to conduct a dawn attack during the Battle of Samakh before rejoining the division's advance to Tiberias. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>dark</b> when the advancing Australians came under heavy rifle and machine-gun fire from German and Ottoman positions near the railway station about [...] away. In response, the 11th Light Horse Regiment conducted a mounted charge that was checked just short of the objective, and one squadron from the 12th advanced along the left flank on horseback, while the other squadrons attempted to draw fire. Once close enough, the squadron from the 12th dismounted and attacked with their bayonets, which forced most of the defenders out of the village, except the Germans defending the fortified railway station house. At this point, the defenders raised a white flag of truce, and as several Australians from the 11th and 12th Light Horse advanced to take their surrender, the Germans manning the station killed them. The Australians then attacked, clearing the building, and later refused to bury the German dead, which amounted to 98, leaving their bodies to be looted by villagers. In the battle, the regiment lost one man killed and 10 wounded; losses suffered by the horses amounted to 61 killed and 27 injured.|$|E
500|$|The regiment's first {{experience}} of combat started at midnight on 18/19 March when their Turkish opponents {{opened fire on}} their trenches. The main assault, in the brigade's sector, was against the Auckland Mounted Rifles; to support them the regiment sent two troops from the 1st and 10th Squadrons and one troop from the 8th Squadron to form their reserve. At daylight, the men manning No.1 Post could see a group of Turks concentrating around [...] "The Nek" [...] and opened fire on them with a machine-gun, forcing them to withdraw. The Turkish attack continued until that afternoon, when it gradually petered out. It was later estimated that 42,000 Turkish troops {{had been involved in}} the attack on the ANZAC beach-head, {{and by the end of}} the day 10,000 of them had become casualties. Later that day white flags were observed over the Turkish trenches, and some of their men wandered into no man's land. This was considered a ruse to retrieve arms and ammunition off the dead and to bring forward reinforcements, so the Turks were warned to return to their trenches as the New Zealanders were going to open fire again. A real armistice was arranged for 24 May, between 07:30 and 16:30, when the wounded were brought to safety and the dead buried. Squadrons settled into a routine with twenty-four hours in No.1 and No.2 Posts, twenty-four hours in the main trenches and twenty-four hours in support, then back to the outposts. Their first offensive action came on 28 May, when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>still</b> <b>dark.</b> The Turks had built an outpost only [...] from No.2 Post, so the 1st Squadron charged and captured the position. Once it was secured, the 6th Squadron from the Wellington Mounted Rifles provided the garrison for what was now called No.3 Post. They had some difficulties defending it, as the Turks launched a counter-attack to recapture it. After a battle lasting until the next day the 10th Squadron and two troops from the 8th Squadron managed to relieve the Wellington Regiment's survivors and take over the defence of the post. Shortly after the relief, it was decided that the position was untenable and it was abandoned. Casualties gradually mounted and the regiment's first replacements, three officers and forty-four other ranks, arrived at the end of June.|$|E
