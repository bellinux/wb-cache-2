Designed by Jordan Klein, green dye {{was meant to}} be used by Bond as a smoke screen to escape pursuers. Instead Ricou Browning, the film's underwater director, used it to make Bond's arrival more dramatic.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to its commanding position, Gibraltar provided a strongly defended harbour from which ships could operate in both the Atlantic and the Mediterranean. Force H, {{under the command of}} Vice-Admiral James Somerville was based in Gibraltar and had the task of maintaining naval superiority and providing a strong escort for convoys to and from the besieged island of Malta. During the course of the war, Gibraltar came under aerial bombardment from Vichy French aircraft and from aircraft of the Italian Royal Air Force (Regia Aeronautica) based on Sardinia. Additionally, the fortress was the focus of underwater attacks by the Italian Royal Navy (Regia Marina) commando <b>frogman</b> unit (Decima Flottiglia MAS) and their human torpedoes. This Italian unit was based on the interned Italian ship SS Olterra in the nearby Spanish harbour of Algeciras. A number of attacks were also carried out by Spanish and Gibraltarian agents acting on behalf of the German Abwehr.|$|E

25|$|Lionel Crabb was a British Royal Navy <b>frogman</b> and MI6 diver who {{vanished}} {{during a}} reconnaissance mission around a Soviet cruiser berthed at Portsmouth Dockyard in 1956. On 16 November 2007, the BBC and the Daily Mirror reported that Eduard Koltsov, a Soviet <b>frogman,</b> {{claimed to have}} caught Crabb placing a mine on the Ordzhonikidze hull near the ammunition depot and cut his throat. In an interview for a Russian documentary film, Koltsov showed the dagger he allegedly used {{as well as an}} Order of the Red Star medal that he claimed to have been awarded for the deed. Koltsov, 74 {{at the time of the}} interview, stated that he wanted to clear his conscience and make known exactly what happened to Crabb.|$|E

25|$|Deciding {{to become}} a wrestler, Austin joined Chris Adams' school in the Dallas Sportatorium, where Adams also {{wrestled}} for World Class Championship Wrestling (WCCW). Adams' training was purely technical, teaching Austin the moves, but nothing relating to kayfabe (still somewhat a guarded secret at the time) or business. His first lesson in that came from Tony Falk, the referee in his 1989 televised WCCW debut against <b>Frogman</b> LeBlanc, who called the spots to lead him to a pinfall and a $40 payday.|$|E
50|$|The rising {{threat of}} attacks by <b>frogmen</b> in naval bases caused various anti-frogman {{techniques}} to be developed, {{and in the}} USSR one of these was guard <b>frogmen</b> sent to stop the attackers. At first these guard <b>frogmen</b> were armed only with knives and AK-type rifles. The AK-47 was carried in a waterproof case and could be used only on the surface, so the only effective underwater weapon against enemy <b>frogmen</b> was the knife.|$|R

It was available in stockinette proofed with black rubber, or proofed fawn twill. The suit consisted {{of a set of}} booted trousers with reinforced soles or optional ankle seals, and a jacket with cuff seals and an option between a neck seal or integral hood. The two parts were connected by a rolled waist seal held in place by a rubber cummerbund. Sizes available were small, medium, large short and large.|$|E
25|$|This {{new type}} of diving came to the {{attention}} of the Regia Marina which founded the first special forces underwater <b>frogman</b> unit, later copied by the Royal Navy and United States Navy. Capitano di Fregata (Commander) Paolo Aloisi was the first commander of the 1ª Flottiglia Mezzi d'Assalto ("First Assault Vehicle Flotilla"), formed in 1939 as a result of the research and development efforts of Majors Teseo Tesei and Elios Toschi of the naval combat engineers. The two resurrected Paolucci's and Rossetti's concept of manned torpedoes.|$|E
25|$|In 1945 the Spearfisherman Company, {{owned by}} Arthur Brown, of Huntington Beach, California was {{approached}} by the US Navy to produce a rubber suit. These were advertised in {{the first issue of}} the Skin Diver magazine in December 1951, as “seamless, one-piece, pure gum rubber, nude freedom <b>frogman</b> suits”. These were entered by a chute which was folded and clamped to seal, and were available as full length or shortie suits with integral hood. Later versions had a neck level entry chute and a nape valve to purge trapped air. The shortie version was also rebranded as Kellys 7-seas suit.|$|E

25|$|Iqbal and Mir were {{emboldened by}} Headley's {{intelligence}} {{and decided to}} make their attack more ambitious in scale. As they expanded their list of targets, Headley scouted the Oberoi Trident Hotel, the Leopold Cafe, and the Chhatrapati Shivaji Terminus. When LeT decided to target the Nariman House, a Jewish community center, Headley visited the location posing as a Jew. Headley also took boat tours to look for places where the attackers could reach the city through the waterfront; he found a landing location at a fishermen's slum in the Colaba area of southern Mumbai, where he gathered GPS coordinates. For the maritime reconnaissance, Headley received assistance from a <b>frogman</b> in the Pakistan Navy.|$|E

500|$|Bond's {{examination}} of the hull of Disco Volante {{was inspired by the}} ill-fated mission undertaken on 19 April 1956 by the ex-Royal Navy <b>frogman</b> [...] "Buster" [...] Crabb on behalf of MI6, as he examined the hull of the Soviet cruiser Ordzhonikidze that had brought Nikita Khrushchev and Nikolai Bulganin on a diplomatic mission to Britain. Crabb disappeared in Portsmouth Harbour and was never seen again. As well as having Buster Crabb in mind, Fleming would also recall the information about the 10th Light Flotilla, an elite unit of Italian navy frogmen who used wrecked ships in Gibraltar to launch attacks on Allied shipping. The specifications for Disco Volante herself had been obtained by Fleming from the Italian ship designer, Leopold Rodriguez.|$|E
500|$|Both of the {{stations}} {{were designed by}} Newcastle upon Tyne-based architects L J Couves & Partners, and construction work began in 1951. The Cleveland Bridge Company were contracted to construct the steel frames for {{the stations}}' main buildings, including their turbine halls, boiler houses, workshops and stores buildings. Various other companies were contracted {{for the construction of}} other parts of the station. Sir Robert McAlpine & Sons were contracted for site clearance, provision of the foundations for the main and ancillary buildings, as well as the diversion of streams and sewers. Davenport Engineering Co. were responsible for the construction of the North station's cooling towers, as well as the stations' ancillary buildings. P.C.Richardson&Co. built the stations' brick chimneys. Aiton & Co. installed the stations' low-pressure piping equipment.
