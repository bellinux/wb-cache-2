5|$|Sherman {{captured}} {{the state capital}} of Columbia, South Carolina, on February 17, 1865. Fires began that night and by next morning most of the central city was destroyed. The burning of Columbia has engendered controversy ever since, with some claiming the fires were accidental, others a <b>deliberate</b> <b>act</b> of vengeance, and still others that the retreating Confederates burned bales of cotton {{on their way out}} of town.|$|E
5|$|In the Ramayana, the Linga Purana and the Mahabharata, Ila {{grows to}} become the king of Bahlika. While hunting in a forest, Ila accidentally trespassed Sharavana ("Forest of Reeds"), the sacred grove of the goddess Parvati, the consort of the god Shiva. Upon {{entering}} Sharavana, all male beings except for Shiva, including trees and animals, are transformed into females. In the Ramayana, even Shiva had assumed {{the form of a}} female to please the goddess. One legend tells that a female yakshini disguised herself as a deer and purposefully led Ila to the grove in order to save her husband from the king. The Linga Purana and the Mahabharata emphasize the sex change of Ila to be a <b>deliberate</b> <b>act</b> of Shiva to start the Lunar dynasty. The Bhagavata Purana et al. texts tell that Ila's entire entourage as well as his horse also changed their genders.|$|E
5|$|Quantrill's Raiders had {{a support}} network in Missouri, that {{provided}} them with numerous hiding places. Anderson's sisters aided the guerrillas by gathering information inside Union territory. In August 1863, however, Union General Thomas Ewing, Jr., attempted to thwart the guerrillas by arresting their female relatives, and Anderson's sisters were confined in a three-story building on Grand Avenue in Kansas City {{with a number of}} other girls. While they were confined, the building collapsed, killing one of Anderson's sisters. In the aftermath, rumors that the building had been intentionally sabotaged by Union soldiers spread quickly; Anderson was convinced that it had been a <b>deliberate</b> <b>act.</b> Biographer Larry Wood wrote that Anderson's motivation shifted {{after the death of his}} sister, arguing that killing then became his focus—and an enjoyable act. Castel and Goodrich maintain that killing became more than a means to an end at that point for Anderson: it became an end in itself.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} a methodology for obtaining probabilistic risk estimates of <b>deliberate</b> unauthorized <b>acts,</b> integrating estimates of frequencies of serious plots, probabilities of avoiding detection and interdiction, probabilities of successful action, {{and consequences of}} the act. This methodology allows us to compare the risks of <b>deliberate</b> <b>acts</b> with those of accidents and to identify the most cost- effective risk reduction measures through cost-benefit analysis...|$|R

25|$|In all, 918 people died, {{including}} 276 children. It was {{the greatest}} single loss of American civilian life in a <b>deliberate</b> <b>act</b> until the events of September 11, 2001. This includes four that died at the Temple headquarters in Georgetown that night.|$|E
25|$|Inoculation offered {{immunity}} to smallpox, but the procedure carried a definite {{risk that the}} inoculated person could die from smallpox as a result. Thus, many parents felt that they would rather do nothing, risking future smallpox arriving at random, rather than carry out a <b>deliberate</b> <b>act</b> that might well kill their children immediately.|$|E
25|$|In July 2007 the Muslim {{religious}} trust which {{administers the}} Mount began digging a 400-metre-long, 1.5-metre-deep trench {{from the northern}} side of the Temple Mount compound to the Dome of the Rock in order to replace 40-year-old electric cables in the area. Israeli archaeologists accused the waqf of a <b>deliberate</b> <b>act</b> of cultural vandalism.|$|E
50|$|Metropolitan Medical Strike Teams (MMSTs) are federally {{established}} teams {{prepared to}} respond (if needed) {{to assist with}} medical management and public health consequences of chemical, biological and radiological incidents which result from accidental or <b>deliberate</b> <b>acts.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Deliberate</b> <b>acts</b> of {{reprisal}} against target {{populations were}} perpetrated by all combatants. All sides practiced {{the shooting of}} hostages on a large scale. At {{the end of the}} war Ustaše collaborators were killed during the Bleiburg massacre.|$|R
5000|$|The {{quotation}} omits {{the line}} [...] "to guard you in all your ways". Robert Gundry {{notes that the}} original wording {{makes it clear that}} God is promising only to protect from accidents, not from <b>deliberate</b> <b>acts</b> such as the one Satan is proposing.|$|R
25|$|Some {{researchers}} (Friesen & Swift, 2009) {{believe that}} the underpricing of IPOs is less a <b>deliberate</b> <b>act</b> {{on the part of}} issuers and/or underwriters, and more the result of an over-reaction on the part of investors (Friesen & Swift, 2009). One potential method for determining underpricing is through the use of IPO underpricing algorithms.|$|E
25|$|Later {{that same}} day, 909 {{inhabitants}} of Jonestown, 304 of them children, died of apparent cyanide poisoning, mostly {{in and around}} the settlement's main pavilion. This resulted in the greatest single loss of American civilian life in a <b>deliberate</b> <b>act</b> until the September 11 attacks. The FBI later recovered a 45-minute audio recording of the suicide in progress.|$|E
25|$|This {{documentary}} {{examines the}} history of election fraud and {{the history of}} corruption in the Judiciary, and in which Raila Odinga claims {{that it can not be}} ruled out that it was a <b>deliberate</b> <b>act</b> or omission by the Court not to subject the technical evidence to scrutiny because the outcome would invalidate the entire election process and discredit the IEBC.|$|E
50|$|The {{immediate}} {{theory was}} that the explosion {{was caused by a}} bomb planted by local terrorists or even arson due to previous <b>deliberate</b> <b>acts</b> in the past. However, there was no trace of explosives, nor were there flammable materials an arsonist could have used.|$|R
25|$|C. <b>Deliberate</b> <b>acts</b> of {{reprisal}} against target {{populations were}} perpetrated by all combatants. All sides practiced {{the shooting of}} hostages on a large scale.

50|$|In June 2000, four churches around India were bombed. In Andhra Pradesh, church graves were desecrated. A {{church in}} Maharashtra was ransacked. In September 2008, two churches were partly damaged in Kerala.

25|$|One {{is to give}} {{statutory}} {{expression to}} the moral and economic rights of creators in their creations {{and the rights of}} the public in access to those creations. The second is to promote, as a <b>deliberate</b> <b>act</b> of Government policy, creativity and the dissemination and application of its results and to encourage fair trading which would contribute to economic and social development.|$|E
25|$|The Shoubak revolt was an {{uprising}} against Ottoman {{authority in the}} Transjordanian town of Shoubak. The uprising started after the Ottoman forces started to put women of the town into forced labor, {{considered to be a}} <b>deliberate</b> <b>act</b> of punishment against the inhabitants of Shoubak who were frequently insubordinate. Shoubak rose in revolt and managed to rally the neighboring Bedouins with them; the perpetuators were brutally punished by military force through an Ottoman expedition sent from Al-Karak, just north of Shoubak.|$|E
25|$|On February 22, 1987 in {{what became}} known as the “War of the Flag”, a brutal militia battle spread {{throughout}} western Beirut between the Druze PSP's military wing, the People’s Liberation Army (PLA) and Amal. The fighting had started when a PLA member had walked to the Channel 7 station and replaced the Lebanese flag with a PSP flag, in what was a <b>deliberate</b> <b>act</b> of provocation. The battle ended with the Amal movement winning the battle and restoring the Lebanese Flag.|$|E

40|$|The Picture of Nobody" {{posits that}} Shakespeare's birth {{as an author}} in print was “aborted” by {{strategies}} of absence that avoided institutionalized forms of authorial representation. Wilson argues that these possibly <b>deliberate</b> <b>acts</b> of evasion and self-concealment are linked to early modern problems of social class and to Shakespeare's ambition to become "a subject without an identity"...|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{completion}} of a review by the Cabinet Office into major contracts across government, Francis Maude, Minister for the Cabinet Office announced in December 2013, that their review had [...] "found no evidence of <b>deliberate</b> <b>acts</b> or omissions by either firm leading to errors or irregularities in the charging and billing arrangements on the 28 contracts investigated.” ...|$|R
25|$|Survivors have {{testified that}} the {{transmission}} of the HIV virus was a <b>deliberate</b> <b>act</b> by talking about how the men, before they raped them, would {{say that they were}} not going to kill them directly but rather give them a slow death from AIDS. Two-thirds of a sample of 1,200 Rwandan genocide widows tested positive for HIV, and the infection rates in rural areas more than doubled after the genocide. There is no data on the number of victims who died from AIDS after 1994 who had contracted the disease from having been raped during the genocide.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{momentary}} respite, by {{the autumn of}} 1321 the tensions between Edward and the baronial opposition led by Thomas of Lancaster, were extremely high, with both sides retaining mobilised forces across the country. At this point, Isabella undertook a pilgrimage to Canterbury, during which she left the traditional route to stop at Leeds Castle, a fortification held by Bartholomew de Badlesmere, steward of the King's household who had by 1321 {{joined the ranks of}} Edward's opponents. Historians believe that the pilgrimage was a <b>deliberate</b> <b>act</b> by Isabella on Edward's behalf to create a casus belli. Lord Badlesmere was away at the time, having left his wife Margaret in charge of the castle. When the latter adamantly refused the Queen admittance, fighting broke out outside the castle between Isabella's guards and the garrison.|$|E
25|$|Even {{before the}} arrival of European {{settlers}} in local districts beyond coastal New South Wales, Eurasian disease often preceded them. A smallpox epidemic was recorded near Sydney in 1789, which wiped out about half the Aborigines around Sydney. Opinion is divided as to the source of the smallpox. Some researchers argue that the smallpox was acquired through contact with Indonesian fishermen in the far north and then spread across the continent, reaching the Sydney area in 1789. Other research by Craig Mear, Michael Bennett, and Christopher Warren argues that, despite controversy, it is highly likely that the 1789 outbreak of smallpox was a <b>deliberate</b> <b>act</b> by British marines when they ran out of ammunition and needed to expand the settlement out to Parramatta. Smallpox then spread well beyond the then limits of European settlement, including much of southeastern Australia, reappearing in 1829–30, killing 40–60 percent of the Aboriginal population.|$|E
50|$|Peace workers re-organised a {{forum for}} re-affirming the hard-sought peace agreement, and brought the warring camps to another {{negotiation}} parley on July 18, 1997 wherein previous peace agreement was duly re-affirmed. However, that too, was aborted by the KNF (P) by <b>deliberate</b> <b>acts</b> of aggression on the villages of Leijangphai, Tallian and Savaipaih in which thirteen houses were burnt down.|$|R
40|$|Abuse {{case has}} great support in {{identifying}} security threats and security requirements caused by outside attackers, {{but it has}} not been used to capture non-malicious <b>deliberate</b> <b>acts</b> for safety concerns that involves inside abusers. It is important to represent inside abusers in a model and distinguish them from inside intruders and outside attackers, since their behaviors are different. The intent {{of this paper is to}} propose a new extension of abuse case to identify <b>deliberate</b> <b>acts</b> of safety threats caused by inside abusers. A new notation vulnerable use case was introduced to express the actions that leads to threats from inside abusers, countermeasures were introduced by safety use cases, and new relationships were defined to clarify the interactions among use cases, vulnerable use cases, safety use cases and abuse cases. This enhanced model provided a way of capturing as much potential risks caused by inside abusers, and embed safety requirements in the early stage of the system development life cycle...|$|R

25|$|Sherman's {{plan was}} to bypass the minor Confederate troop {{concentrations}} at Augusta, Georgia, and Charleston, South Carolina, and reach Goldsboro, North Carolina, by March 15, 1865, where he would unite with Union forces commanded by John M. Schofield and Alfred H. Terry. As with his Georgia operations, he marched his armies in multiple directions simultaneously, confusing the scattered Confederate defenders as to his first true objective, which was the state capital Columbia. He faced the smaller and battered Army of Tennessee, again {{under the command of}} Gen. Joseph E. Johnston. On February 17, Columbia surrendered to Sherman. Fires began in the city, and most of the central city was destroyed. The burning of Columbia has engendered controversy ever since, with some claiming the fires were accidental, others a <b>deliberate</b> <b>act</b> of vengeance. On that same day, the Confederates evacuated Charleston. On February 18, Sherman's forces destroyed virtually anything of military value in Columbia. The last significant Confederate seaport, Wilmington, surrendered on February 22.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{momentary}} respite delivered by Isabella, by {{the autumn of}} 1321, the tensions between the two factions of Edward, Isabella and the Despenser, opposing the baronial opposition led by Thomas of Lancaster, were extremely high, with forces still mobilised across the country. At this point, Isabella undertook a pilgrimage to Canterbury, during which she left the traditional route to stop at Leeds Castle in Kent, a fortification held by Bartholomew de Badlesmere, steward of the King's household who had by 1321 {{joined the ranks of}} Edward's opponents. Historians believe that the pilgrimage was a <b>deliberate</b> <b>act</b> by Isabella on Edward's behalf to create a casus belli. Lord Badlesmere was away at the time, having left his wife Margaret in charge of the castle. When the latter adamantly refused the Queen admittance, fighting broke out outside the castle between Isabella's guards and the garrison, marking the beginning of the Despenser War. Whilst Edward mobilised his own faction and placed Leeds castle under siege, Isabella was given the Great Seal and assumed control of the royal Chancery from the Tower of London. After surrendering to Edward's forces on 31 October 1321, Margaret, Baroness Badlesmere and her children were sent to the Tower, and 13 of the Leeds garrison were hanged. By January 1322, Edward's army, reinforced by the Despensers returning from exile, had forced the surrender of the Mortimers, and by March Lancaster himself had been captured after the battle of Boroughbridge; Lancaster was promptly executed, leaving Edward and the Despensers victorious.|$|E
500|$|False {{imprisonment}} {{is defined}} as [...] "depriving the claimant of freedom of movement, without a lawful justification for doing so". Unlike assault and battery, false imprisonment is a tort of strict liability: no intention on the behalf of the defendant is needed, but the imprisonment must {{be caused by a}} <b>deliberate</b> <b>act</b> (as decided in Sayers v Harlow Urban District Council, where a faulty lock, not a <b>deliberate</b> <b>act</b> from another party, caused a woman to become trapped in a public toilet) and must be unlawful. The imprisonment of a lawfully convicted criminal is not false, nor is the arrest of a suspect if done in line with the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005 and Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984.|$|E

5000|$|Ruins (from the Latin [...] "Ruina") are {{the remains}} of human-made architecture: {{structures}} that were once intact have fallen, as time went by, {{into a state of}} partial or total disrepair, due to lack of maintenance or <b>deliberate</b> <b>acts</b> of destruction.
