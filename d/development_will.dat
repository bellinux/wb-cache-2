If energy use grows too fast, renewable energy <b>development</b> <b>will</b> chase a receding target. Likewise, unless clean energy supplies come online rapidly, slowing demand growth will only begin to reduce total emissions; reducing the carbon content of energy sources is also needed.|$|E

In a special {{editorial}} in The Grand Rapids Press after the freeway opened in 2004, local resident Curt MacDougall summarized the criticisms of the new freeway. He cited the loss of rural farmland and wetlands as a negative effect of the highway. The editorial also discussed that the freeway does decrease travel times for some residents, but it will mean increased development. That <b>development</b> <b>will</b> mean further urban sprawl, and could spur the creation of additional highways in the area.|$|E

5|$|The heart {{derives from}} splanchnopleuric mesenchyme in the neural plate which forms the {{cardiogenic}} region. Two endocardial tubes form here that fuse {{to form a}} primitive heart tube known as the tubular heart. Between {{the third and fourth}} week, the heart tube lengthens, and begins to fold to form an S-shape within the pericardium. This places the chambers and major vessels into the correct alignment for the developed heart. Further <b>development</b> <b>will</b> include the septa and valves formation and remodelling of the heart chambers. By the end of the fifth week the septa are complete and the heart valves are completed by the ninth week.|$|E
