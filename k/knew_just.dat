500|$|The {{sculpture}} {{was installed}} on October 31 and unveiled on November 1, 1994 {{in front of}} a national audience by Jordan, Reinsdorf and Larry King. [...] Jordan's jersey number was retired during the ceremony. Only Jordan's knee is attached to the base via a triple-steel post. [...] A stationary basketball hoop was almost part of the sculpture too. The sculpture, which is hollow, was designed to withstand the natural elements. After his second retirement following the 1997–98 NBA season, the following quote from the 1992 film A River Runs Through It was added to the base: [...] "At that moment I knew, surely and clearly, that I was witnessing perfection. He stood before us, suspended above the earth, free from all its laws like a work of art, and I <b>knew,</b> <b>just</b> as surely and clearly, that life is not a work of art, and that the moment could not last." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{situation}} {{continued in}} the same way throughout 1942. By March, the few suitable aircraft in operational service were nokt serviceable most of the time. By 15 January 1942, de la Ferté <b>knew</b> <b>just</b> one-fifth of his aircraft were operational. The situation slowly improved throughout the year despite mounting convoy losses and resistance from Bomber Command. By the time John Slessor succeeded de la Ferté as AOC-in-C, he identified 60 squadrons with a total of 850 aircraft, of which 34 were A/S squadrons, operating 450 machines. Slessor felt the Catalina was too vulnerable to U-boat flak and the [...] "prima donnas", namely the Liberator with its long range, were not available in sufficient numbers. On 18 June 1942 the War Cabinet was told that Coastal Command had only 39 Liberators. When it became obvious that the losses to U-boats were becoming unacceptable in March 1943, Coastal Command was finally given sufficient resources it needed.|$|E

500|$|Once {{the second}} new ball was taken after tea, Lindwall {{returned}} but {{appeared to be}} tired and lacking in spirit in his first over. Johnston removed Compton, and one run later, Lindwall clipped Yardley's off stump with the first ball of the next over to leave England at 134/6; the home skipper had made 44 before an outswinger had evaded his bat as he attempted to play a back foot defensive shot. At {{the start of the}} third morning, he bowled Alec Bedser off an inside edge from a bouncer to finish with 5/70 as Australia took a 135-run first innings lead on the third morning. O'Reilly said Lindwall [...] "bowled as well as any fast bowler can bowl. He always seemed to have the situation sized up correctly and he <b>knew</b> <b>just</b> when to put his all into the task...and enjoyed a triumph which seldom comes to any bowler." [...] Arlott praised Lindwall for his subtle variations in pace, line and length, and how he kept the batsman guessing as to what was coming to them.|$|E
500|$|On {{the third}} morning, Bedser and Wright survived for 20 minutes, and Lindwall {{tried to break}} their {{resistance}} by aiming a few bouncers at the former. Bedser eventually inside edged a Lindwall bouncer onto his stumps, ending England's innings at 215, giving Australia a 135-run first innings lead. Lindwall ended with 5/70, while Johnson took 3/72 and Johnston 2/43. Toshack was the other bowler used, sending down 18 overs {{for the loss of}} 23 runs. In later years, Bradman told Lindwall that he pretended not to notice his bowler's pain. Lindwall was worried his captain had noticed the injury, but Bradman later claimed to have feigned ignorance to allow his paceman to relax. O'Reilly said Lindwall [...] "bowled as well as any fast bowler can bowl. He always seemed to have the situation sized up correctly and he <b>knew</b> <b>just</b> when to put his all into the task... and enjoyed a triumph which seldom comes to any bowler."

500|$|Originally, Descent 3 was {{intended}} to support both a software and a hardware renderer, implying that the rendering process of the game could take place either in the CPU or dedicated hardware like a video card. However, about six months after starting development, the team decided {{to go with a}} hardware-only renderer because it allowed them to create [...] "visually stunning" [...] graphics and maintain a solid frame rate without worrying about the limitations imposed by the software renderer. This was a difficult decision since the team had to scrap many tools and software rendering technology that were already developed. In addition, computers with hardware acceleration were not common at the time the decision was made. As the developers noted, [...] "We <b>knew</b> <b>just</b> by looking at our progress on the game under acceleration that we had a beautiful looking game with all the latest technologies — but would anyone actually be able to play it?" [...] Fortunately, as development progressed, hardware acceleration became more popular with each passing year. The game natively supports the Direct3D, Glide and OpenGL rendering APIs for graphics, and the A3D and DirectSound3D technologies for sound.|$|E

500|$|The album's opening {{series of}} songs have {{straightforward}} lyrics. On [...] "Back to Love", Bilal flatters his date's shoes and {{is backed by}} a bubbling funk groove. The song draws on the music of Prince, while the jazz guitar licks of [...] "Winning Hand" [...] draw on Steely Dan. [...] "Climbing" [...] has a rugged beat and a lyrical allusion to The Notorious B.I.G.'s 1993 song [...] "Party and Bullshit". The middle section of the album explores broader emotions and themes of loss and lament. [...] "Slipping Away" [...] is a slow-building meditation on loss, with sentimental music backing the narrator's plea to a departing love. On the slow burning pop rock song [...] "Lost for Now", he comes to terms with being alone and leaves town, but finds salvation in [...] "a smile that changes everything" [...] as the song closes with a shimmer of cymbal. The stark ballad [...] "Butterfly" [...] is built around Bilal's soaring falsetto and Glasper's rippling piano. Its music explores jazz, and also features dreamy Moog accents. The album closes with lyrics about the promise of tomorrow: [...] "Woke up this morning {{to the sound of}} a bluebird singing / Suddenly I <b>knew</b> <b>just</b> where to begin / Something so simple / How can it speak so loud to me?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Progressively after Nicolae Ceauşescu's arrival to power, {{an event}} which {{signaled}} {{the start of}} relative liberalization together with the open encouragement of nationalism, Georgescu responded to the official policies. Dimisianu mentions Georgescu, together with Miron-Radu Parashivescu, Marin Preda, Zaharia Stancu, Baconsky, Dumitrescu, Jebeleanu, Bogza, and Cohmălniceanu, among those who actively helped his generation, as [...] "writers and literary critics who had initially paid a toll to proletkultism, and [...] were silently parting with it, returning to literature, to actual criticism". At that stage, Bedros Horasangian argues, Georgescu [...] "played along", transforming himself from a [...] "not at all naïve or innocent critic and literary ideologue" [...] into a person who acknowledged the change in perspective. According to Horasangian, Georgescu himself was [...] "joking that 'Winter and summer are different things'—he probably always <b>knew,</b> <b>just</b> like Leonte Răutu, who, the more vigilant he was (or appeared), the more intensely he was reading 'rightist' French newspapers and magazines". During a 2004 interview, reflecting {{on the value of}} literature produced under communism, literary historian Alex. Ştefănescu recalled: [...] "Paul Georgescu had a saying he used when I was asking him with half-irony: 'Mr. Paul, how was it possible that you wrote so badly in the years of dogmatism?'. 'Forget that, dear—he would say—the problem is that I couldn't tell I was writing badly'." ...|$|E

When anyone said anything against them, we <b>knew</b> <b>just</b> what that person was worth. The authorities, our teachers, even our parents, became idiots to us." [...] Despite the attempts of the Soviet Union's government {{to prevent the spread}} of the Beatles' popularity amongst their citizens, the band proved to be as popular in the USSR as it was in Britain. The government went as far as censoring the expression of all Western ideals, including the Beatles' bourgeois eccentricity, limiting the Soviet citizens' access to their music. Leslie Woodland, a documentary film maker, commented regarding what the Russian people were told about the West – [...] "Once people heard the Beatles' wonderful music, it just didn't fit. The authorities' prognosis didn't correspond to what they were listening to. The system was built on fear and lies, and in this way, the Beatles put an end to the fear, and exposed the lies." [...] Pavel Palazchenko, Mikhail Gorbachev's conference interpreter, stated that the Beatles' music was a [...] "source of musical relief. They helped us create a world of our own, a world different from the dull and senseless ideological liturgy that increasingly reminded me of Stalinism...". Like Gorbachev, many Russian youth agreed that the Beatles were a way to overcome the cultural isolation imposed by the Cold War and reinforced by their current political system.|$|E
