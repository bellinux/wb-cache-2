5|$|At the August 19th {{semifinal}} rounds, Henry {{was placed}} in Heat 1, again against Wariner and also versus Brenes and Christopher Brown of the Bahamas, among others. Tabarie Henry ran the event in 45.19seconds, ending seventh out of eight athletes in the <b>heat,</b> <b>at</b> 0.13seconds behind Cuba's Williams Collazo (6th place) and 0.45seconds ahead of Italy's Claudio Licciardello (8th place). Overall, Henry ranked 17th out of 24 athletes, and did not progress to finals on August 21.|$|E
5|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} plants may use thermal storage to store solar energy, such as in {{high-temperature}} molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver <b>heat</b> <b>at</b> temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. This method of energy storage is used, for example, by the Solar Two power station, allowing it to store 1.44TJ in its 68m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.|$|E
5|$|French cuisine varies {{according}} to the season. In summer, salads and fruit dishes are popular because they are refreshing and produce is inexpensive and abundant. Greengrocers prefer to sell their fruit and vegetables at lower prices if needed, rather than see them rot in the <b>heat.</b> <b>At</b> the end of summer, mushrooms become plentiful and appear in stews throughout France. The hunting season begins in September and runs through February. Game of all kinds is eaten, often in elaborate dishes that celebrate {{the success of the}} hunt. Shellfish are at their peak when winter turns to spring, and oysters appear in restaurants in large quantities.|$|E

Virus was recovered from whole milk of infected cows after that milk was <b>heated</b> <b>at</b> 72 degrees C. for 5 min. {{and from the}} skim milk component after it was <b>heated</b> <b>at</b> the same temperature for 2 min. Evaporation of the whole milk samples after they were <b>heated</b> <b>at</b> 72 degrees C. for 3 min. did not inactivate the virus, but evaporation of infected skim milk samples after they were <b>heated</b> <b>at</b> 72 degrees C. for 0 - 5 min. did inactivate the virus.

40|$|Detoxification of {{crocidolite}} particles in sprayed crocidolite {{was performed by}} a combination of heating and grinding treatment. Crocidolite crystal was detected XRD analysis in the sample <b>heated</b> <b>at</b> temperatures below 800 ℃ for 3 h, but not after <b>heating</b> <b>at</b> 900 ℃ for 3 h. Although crocidolite crystal remained in the sample <b>heated</b> <b>at</b> the temperatures over 500 ℃, the crocidolite particles could be easily ground using a mortar to smaller than several micrometers in size, which is safe for the human body (below 8 μm).

5|$|Ganymede is {{composed}} primarily of silicate rock and water ice, and a salt-water ocean {{is believed to}} exist nearly 200km below Ganymede's surface, sandwiched between layers of ice. The metallic core of Ganymede suggests a greater <b>heat</b> <b>at</b> some time in its past than had previously been proposed. The surface {{is a mix of}} two types of terrain—highly cratered dark regions and younger, but still ancient, regions with a large array of grooves and ridges. Ganymede has a high number of craters, but many are gone or barely visible due to its icy crust forming over them. The satellite has a thin oxygen atmosphere that includes O, O2, and possibly O3 (ozone), and some atomic hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Rubidium {{compounds}} {{are sometimes}} used in fireworks {{to give them}} a purple color. Rubidium has also been considered for use in a thermoelectric generator using the magnetohydrodynamic principle, where rubidium ions are formed by <b>heat</b> <b>at</b> high temperature and passed through a magnetic field. These conduct electricity and act like an armature of a generator thereby generating an electric current. Rubidium, particularly vaporized 87Rb, {{is one of the most}} commonly used atomic species employed for laser cooling and Bose–Einstein condensation. Its desirable features for this application include the ready availability of inexpensive diode laser light at the relevant wavelength, and the moderate temperatures required to obtain substantial vapor pressures. For cold atom applications requiring tunable interactions, 85Rb is preferable due to its rich Feshbach spectrum.|$|E
5|$|The {{resistive}} Joule {{heating effect}} employed in filament light bulbs also sees more direct use in electric heating. While this is versatile and controllable, {{it can be}} seen as wasteful, since most electrical generation has already required the production of <b>heat</b> <b>at</b> a power station. A number of countries, such as Denmark, have issued legislation restricting or banning the use of resistive electric heating in new buildings. Electricity is however still a highly practical energy source for heating and refrigeration, with air conditioning/heat pumps representing a growing sector for electricity demand for heating and cooling, the effects of which electricity utilities are increasingly obliged to accommodate.|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{asbestos}} waste such as asbestos cement board, sprayed crocidolite and sprayed amosite was heated in a vacuum. The detoxification conditions were then established {{in reference to}} JIS A 1481 : 2006 and JIS K 3850 - 1 : 2006. When asbestos cement board was <b>heated</b> <b>at</b> 700 ℃ for 1 h, detoxification of the cement board was completed. On the other hand, {{in the case of}} amphibolic {{asbestos waste}}, such as sprayed crocidolite and sprayed amosite, was heated, a phase-contrast microscope analysis was not applicable for identification of asbestos <b>heated</b> <b>at</b> more than 500 ℃. According to XRD analysis, crocidolite was eliminated by <b>heating</b> <b>at</b> 800 ℃ for 3 h. Furthermore, amosite was not detected after <b>heating</b> <b>at</b> 700 ℃ for 3 h. Finally, the grindability of heated amphibolic asbestos was investigated. When sprayed crocidolite was <b>heated</b> <b>at</b> 900 ℃ for 3 h and then ground with a mortar for 300 s, the crushed grains had a length of less than 5 μm and an aspect ratio of 3.

40|$|The {{formation}} and structural characteristics of slowly digestible non-pasted granular starch in sweet potato starch were investigated under various hydrothermal treatment conditions. The moisture {{content of the}} sweet potato starch was adjusted to 20, 50 or 90 %, and the starch was <b>heated</b> <b>at</b> 40, 55 or 1007 C for 12 h in a dry oven. The relative crystallinity of the hydrothermally treated samples was decreased with increasing temperature, and the X-ray diffraction patterns of the samples were altered from Cb-type to A-type. Microscopic observations did not reveal any changes in the starch granules of any samples except those with moisture contents of 50 and 90 % that were <b>heated</b> <b>at</b> 1007 C. When gelatinization parameters were examined, samples with moisture contents of 50 and 90 % that were <b>heated</b> <b>at</b> 557 C and samples of all moisture contents that were <b>heated</b> <b>at</b> 1007 C had peak temperatures {{higher than that of}} raw starch but gelatinization enthalpies lower than that of raw starch. The swelling factor of the samples <b>heated</b> <b>at</b> 407 C did not change significantly, whereas that of samples <b>heated</b> <b>at</b> 55 and 1007 C was decreased at increased moisture levels. The sweet potato starch with 50 % moisture content that was <b>heated</b> <b>at</b> 557 C had the highest content of granular slowly digestible starch, about 200 % that of raw starch, although our study did not involve further hydrothermal treatment conditions. Further study is required to complete a process for more efficient production of heat stable and slowly digestible starch...|$|R
5|$|The {{semifinal}} {{round of}} the women's 200meters took place on August 20, where Stewart participated in the eight-person first <b>heat.</b> <b>At</b> {{the end of the}} race, she placed second, finishing with a time of 22.29seconds. The United States' Muna Lee finished with the same time as Stewart. Bahamian runner Debbie Ferguson-McKenzie ranked behind Stewart and Lee (22.51seconds), while fellow Jamaican Veronica Campbell placed ahead of them to take first in the heat (22.19seconds). Stewart took second out of the 16 athletes who advanced to the semifinal round. She advanced to finals. During the last round, Stewart took the bronze medal when she finished the race with a time of 22.00seconds. Muna Lee placed fourth (22.01seconds), while Allyson Felix won the silver medal (21.93seconds).|$|E
5|$|Trinidad and Tobago {{submitted}} {{a team to}} participate in the 4×100meters relay. Although each relay consists of four people, five Trinidadians were involved between both the first and second (final) round. During the first round, Trinidad and Tobago participated in the first heat, which consisted of then 20-year-old Port-of-Spain-born Keston Bledman, who only participated in the relay; Marc Burns, who also participated in the men's 100meters; Richard Thompson, who also medaled in the men's 100meters; and Aaron Armstrong, who also ran in the men's 200meters. The relay ran the collective 400meters in 38.26 seconds, placing first in the first heat during the August 21 semifinal (and first) round. Trinidad and Tobago defeated Japan, which placed second in the <b>heat</b> (<b>at</b> 38.52seconds) and the Netherlands, which placed third (38.87seconds). The Trinidadian team placed first overall out of the ten relays that finished, and progressed to the August 22 final round.|$|E
5|$|In 1992 a {{party of}} French {{academics}} attended a condensed matter conference in Ukraine where physicist Daniel Beysens introduced them {{to the story of}} how ancient Theodosia was supplied with water from dew condensers. They were sufficiently intrigued that in 1993 they went to see for themselves. They concluded that the mounds that Zibold identified as dew condensers were in fact ancient burial mounds (a part of the necropolis of antic Theodosia) and that the pipes were medieval in origin and not associated with the mounds. They found the remains of Zibold's condenser, which they tidied up and examined closely. Zibold's condenser had apparently performed reasonably well, but in fact his exact results are not at all clear, and {{it is possible that the}} collector was intercepting fog, which added significantly to the yield. If Zibold's condenser worked at all, this was probably due to fact that a few stones near the surface of the mound were able to lose <b>heat</b> <b>at</b> night while being thermally isolated from the ground; however, it could never have produced the yield that Zibold envisaged.|$|E

5|$|Most {{of these}} studies give two thermoregulatory roles for the sail of Dimetrodon: one {{as a means of}} warming quickly in the morning, and another as a way to cool down when body {{temperature}} becomes high. Dimetrodon and all other Early Permian land vertebrates are assumed to have been cold-blooded or poikilothermic, relying on the sun to maintain a high body temperature. Because of its large size, Dimetrodon had high thermal inertia, meaning that changes in body temperature occurred more slowly in it than in smaller-bodied animals. As temperatures rose in the mornings, the small-bodied prey of Dimetrodon could warm their bodies much faster than could something the size of Dimetrodon. Many paleontologists including Haack have proposed that the sail of Dimetrodon may have allowed it to warm quickly in the morning in order to keep pace with its prey. The sail's large surface area also meant heat could dissipate quickly into the surroundings, useful if the animal needed to release excess heat produced by metabolism or absorbed from the sun. Dimetrodon may have angled its sail away from the sun to cool off or restricted blood flow to the sail to maintain <b>heat</b> <b>at</b> night.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} numerically {{the effect of}} thermal boundary conditions on conjugated conduction-free convection heat transfer in an annulus between two concentric cylinders using Fourier Spectral method. The inner wall of the annulus is <b>heated</b> and maintained <b>at</b> either CWT (Constant Wall Temperature) or CHF (Constant Heat Flux), while the outer wall is maintained at constant temperature. CHF case is relatively more significant for high pressure industrial applications, {{but it has not}} received much attention. This study particularly focuses the latter case (CHF). The main influencing parameters on flow and thermal fields within the annulus are: Rayleigh number Ra; thickness of inner wall Rs; radius ratio Rr and inner wall-fluid thermal conductivity ratio Kr. The study has shown that the increase in Kr increases the heat transfer rate through the annulus for <b>heating</b> <b>at</b> CWT and decreases the inner wall dimensionless temperature for <b>heating</b> <b>at</b> CHF and vice versa.
