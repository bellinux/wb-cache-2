The {{renewable sources of energy}} derived from the sun are one of the promising options. The photovoltaic cells as one of renewable energy sources have been largely studied in order to obtain cheap, efficient and secure PV cells. The conversion efficiency is the most important property in the PV domain. Indium gallium nitride (InGaN) alloys offer great potential for high-efﬁciency photovoltaics. We present numerical simulations of GaN/InGaN heterojunction solar cells by SCAPs simulation. The calculation of characteristic parameters: short-circuit current density, open-circuit voltage, and conversion efficiency. So, these simulations study the effect of indium content and thickness in these parameters.

40|$|Occupancy is {{the percent}} of time a traffic loop {{detector}} embedded in the road pavement is occupied by vehicles. This term is usually used as a substitution for the traffic density which is not feasible to obtain from detectors. One of the recent applications for the traffic occupancy is in calculating the timing for traffic signals on motorway entrances (Ramp Metering, RM). Most of the existing algorithms for RM assume that these <b>devices</b> will <b>not</b> <b>operate</b> until the traffic occupancy upstream or downstream from the merge area exceeds a specific value called “critical occupancy”. This paper focuses on estimating the critical occupancy using Motorway Incident Detection and Automatic Signalling (MIDAS) data. The data is taken from loop detectors located on three motorway sites in the UK. The results are compared with corresponding values as adopted by the Highways Agency for these sites to operate the ramp metering. The {{results show that the}} values which are currently used to operate the ramp metering devices in these sites are higher than those obtained from analysing the data.

40|$|Medical {{devices are}} used to diagnose, treat, or prevent a disease or {{abnormal}} physical condition without any chemical action in the body. They can also result in unintended incidents and other errors. This thesis was divided into three chapters: i) a systematic review on the recognition, reporting and resolution of incidents related to medical devices and other health technologies; ii) telephone interviews with physicians and registered nurses (RNs) to solicit information on the resolution, reporting and resolution of medical device-related incidents based on their professional experience; and iii) a case study to review the continuous quality improvement (CQI) data retrieved from the wireless smart infusion pump system at The Ottawa Hospital (TOH) and to propose a CQI data analysis process. The systematic review included 30 studies on factors that influence the recognition, reporting and resolution of incidents in hospitals and interventions to improve patient safety. Central themes that emerged for incident reporting were personal attitudes, awareness and perception of incident reporting systems, organizational culture, and feedback to healthcare professionals. In our telephone interviews, physicians and RNs attributed incident recognition to <b>devices</b> <b>not</b> <b>operating</b> based on the manufacturer’s instructions, and to the hospital staff’s knowledge of and professional experience {{with the use of}} the medical device, and clinical manifestations of patients. Suggestions to improve medical device safety surveillance centered on education and training to ensure that the staff is able to use the medical device properly and know what would be considered an error, and how to report these errors. The results of the systematic review and interviews helped to inform the design of a medical device surveillance framework in a hospital setting. Our case study assessed the Dose Error Reduction Software compliance and frequency of soft and hard limit alerts with wireless smart infusion pump systems over a one year period. A CQI data analysis process to monitor the performance of wireless smart infusion pumps is proposed.

In this paper, we investigate the utilization of low-altitude aerial mesh net-works composed by Small Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (SUAVs) in order to re-enstablish connectivity among isolated end-user (EU) devices located on the ground. Aerial ad-hoc networks provide the advantage to be deployable also on critical scenarios where terrestrial mobile <b>devices</b> might <b>not</b> <b>operate,</b> however their implementation is challenging {{from the point of}} view of mobility management and of coverage lifetime. In this paper, we address both these issues with three novel research contributions. First, we propose a distributed mobility algorithm, based on the virtual spring model, through which the SUAV-based mesh node-called also Repairing Units (RUs) in this study- can self-organize into a mesh structure by guaranteeing Quality of Service (QoS) over the aerial link, and connecting the maximum number of EU devices. Second, we evaluate our scheme on a realistic 3 D environment with buildings, and we demonstrate the effectiveness of the aerial deployment compared to a terrestrial one, in terms of coverage and wireless link reliability. Third, we address the problem of energy lifetime, and we propose a distributed charging scheduling scheme, through which a persistent coverage of RUs can be guaranteed over the emergency scenario.

40|$|To better prepare {{students}} for careers in the electric power industry, specifically in the discipline of power system protection, the Electrical Engineering Department at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo proposed an initiative calling {{for the creation of}} new laboratory curriculum that uses microprocessor-based relays to give students hands-on experience in the application of protection theory. This report describes the creation of a system that meets this need by providing a laboratory-scale power system that demonstrates the use of common protective relays and protection schemes. This system provides a platform for laboratory coursework using protective relays for transmission line, transformer, and induction motor protection. Within this laboratory system, one of the primary goals of the project was the integration of the SEL- 311 L Line Protection Relay and the SEL- 710 Motor Protection Relay as part of the overall protection scheme. Development of the project was completed successfully, producing a protection scheme that protects power transmission equipment and the induction motor in both radial and bidirectional systems. The system clears all desired fault types and abnormal operating conditions with primary protection elements for each piece of equipment, as well as time-coordinated backup protection system-wide. The completed protection system is selective, removing only the minimum amount of power equipment necessary to clear fault conditions. It is also secure, in that normal operation does not result in unnecessary trips, and reliable, in that all fault conditions are cleared even when primary protection <b>devices</b> do <b>not</b> <b>operate.</b> The SEL- 311 L and SEL- 710 relays were implemented successfully, and used to demonstrate more complex and advanced protection methods than simple overcurrent elements, such as permissive overreach transfer trips and motor thermal modeling...|$|R
40|$|Quantum cascade lasers {{provide some}} of the highest output powers {{available}} for light in the mid-infrared range (from 3 to 8 m). As many of their applications require portability, designs that have a high wall-plug efficiency are essential, and were designed and grown by others to achieve this goal. However, because a large fraction of these <b>devices</b> did <b>not</b> <b>operate</b> at all, very few of the standard laser measurements could be performed to determine their properties. Therefore, measurements needed to be performed that could non-destructively probe the behavior of QCLs while still providing useful information. This thesis explores these types of measurements, all of which fall into the category of device spectroscopy. Through polarization-dependent transmission and photovoltaic spectroscopy, {{a large portion of the}} quantum mechanical bandstructure could be determined, along with many of the parameters characterizing crystal growth quality. In addition, high-resolution transmission spectroscopy was used to find the properties of the QCL waveguide. In order to find the correspondence between theory and experiment, bandstructure simulations were performed using a three-band p model, and two-dimensional electromagnetic simulations were performed to describe the laser's optical properties. These simulations were found to be in relatively good agreement with the device measurements, and any discrepancies were found to be consistent with problems in the growth and fabrication. by David Patrick Burghoff.

40|$|When organic {{light-emitting}} diodes (OLEDs) {{are exposed to}} the ambient atmosphere, water penetration through pinholes in the cathode results in the formation of non-emissive areas (black spots) due to local oxidation of the cathode around the pinhole. This degradation effect severely limits the lifetime of OLED devices and requires high performance encapsulation in order to delay its onset. We have investigated the process of degradation of OLED devices by water penetration through cathode pinholes, and have discovered that {{this is not just a}} simple oxidation of the cathode occurring as water diffuses within the device. We have observed that other layers within the device interact with the water. In solution processed OLEDs, the hole-injection layer (PEDOT:PSS) absorbs water due to the presence of the PSS acid (formation of H 3 O+). This results in a slight local reduction of the luminance of the device (grey spot) around the pinhole location and actually a reduction of the cathode black spot growth rate at the pinhole during a shelf lifetime test. When the <b>device</b> is <b>not</b> <b>operated,</b> the PEDOT:PSS layer is acting as a local reservoir for water keeping it away from the cathode and slowing down the cathode degradation. However, when the device is operated, water that is captured by the PEDOT:PSS layer to form H 3 O+ can be transported to the cathode under the influence of the applied electric field. This then increases the black spot growth rate. Experimental indications for this operational effect are provided by the threshold voltage behaviour of the effect and transient behaviour of the black spot growth after switching off the OLED. Direct evidence for the role of PEDOT:PSS in the operational effect has been provided by Raman Spectroscopy...|$|R

German EOD experts were notified and attended the scene. Whilst residents living nearby were being evacuated and the EOD personnel were preparing to disarm the bomb, it detonated, killing three of them and severely injuring 6 others. The dead and injured each had over 20 years of hands-on experience, and had previously rendered safe between 600 and 700 unexploded bombs.

40|$|An {{approach}} to parallelize the simulation of AC-Radial Shipboard Power Systems (SPSs) using multicore computers is presented. Time domain simulations of SPSs are notoriously slow, due principally {{to the number}} of components, and the time-variance of the component models. A common {{approach to}} reduce the simulation run-time of power systems is to formulate the electrical network equations using modified nodal analysis, use Bergeron's travelling-wave transmission line model to create subsystems, and to parallelize the simulation using a distributed computer. In this work, an SPS was formulated using loop analysis, defining the subsystems using a diakoptics-based approach, and the simulation parallelized using a multicore computer. A program was developed in C# to conduct multithreaded parallel-sequential simulations of an SPS. The program first represents an SPS as a graph, and then partitions the graph. Each graph partition represents a SPS subsystem and is computationally balanced using iterative refinement heuristics. Once balanced subsystems are obtained, each SPS subsystem's electrical network equations are formulated using loop analysis. Each SPS subsystem is solved using a unique thread, and each thread is manually assigned to a core of a multicore computer. To validate the partitioning approach, performance metrics were created to assess the speed gain and accuracy of the partitioned SPS simulations. The simulation parameters swept for the performance metrics were the number of partitions, the number of cores used, and the time step increment. The results of the performance metrics showed adequate speed gains with negligible error. An increasing simulation speed gain was observed when the number of partitions and cores were augmented, obtaining maximum speed gains of < 30 x when using a quadcore computer. Results show that the speed gain is more sensitive to the number partitions than is {{to the number of}} cores. While multicore computers are suitable for parallel-sequential SPS simulations, increasing the number of cores does not contribute to the gain in speed as much as does partitioning. The simulation error increased with the simulation time step but did not influence the partitioned simulation results. The number of operations caused by protective devices was used to determine whether the simulation error introduced by partitioning SPS simulations produced a inconsistent system behavior. It is shown, for the time step sizes uses, that protective <b>devices</b> did <b>not</b> <b>operate</b> inadvertently, which indicates that the errors did not alter RMS measurement and, hence, were non-influential...|$|R
