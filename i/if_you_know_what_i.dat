25|$|Ghostface {{has been}} parodied and {{referenced}} numerous times in media following his {{appearance in the}} Scream series of slasher films, most prominently in the parody film Scary Movie (2000) where a killer dressed as Ghostface commits a series of murders and is later revealed to be several people as in Scream. In the parody film Shriek <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Know</b> <b>What</b> <b>I</b> Did Last Friday the Thirteenth (2000), a killer wearing a Jason Voorhees-style hockey mask is set on fire, his mask melting to resemble that of Ghostface. The film Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back (2001) features Ghostface, as Shannen Doherty and Craven provide cameos as themselves making the then non-existent Scream 4, but Doherty objects when Ghostface {{turns out to be}} played by the orangutan, Suzann.|$|E
500|$|The lyrics feature LaBelle {{offering}} {{advice on}} how to keep a man's attention and sexual interest. LaBelle described the single as an [...] "anthem for women", in which she defined the term [...] "sexify" [...] as a way for women to [...] "make [...] feel comfortable and confident and happy and proud" [...] or help their men feel the same way. The chorus is accompanied by a [...] "summery two-step tune", and includes lyrics such as [...] "I gotta whole bunch of ways" [...] and [...] "He'll come home girl / <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean." [...] LaBelle continues to instruct women by singing: [...] "I'll sexify you / Have you thinking about my name {{in the middle of the}} day." ...|$|E

2500|$|One of the marvellous {{things about}} John Bonham which made things very easy [...] {{was the fact}} that he really knew how to tune his drums, and I tell you what, that was pretty rare in drummers in those days. He really knew how to make the {{instrument}} sing, and because of that, he could just get so much volume out of it by just playing with his wrists. It was just an astonishing technique that was sort of pretty holistic <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean.|$|E
6000|$|... "And I'm frightfully obliged, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean. Aunt Agatha {{would have}} had sixteen or {{seventeen}} fits if you hadn't headed him off." ...|$|E
