40|$|Background: Tear gas shells {{are used}} to {{disperse}} the mob during any type of street protests. Vascular injuries due to tear gas shells have not been reported. The present study was un-dertaken to analyse the pattern, presentation, management and outcome of vascular injury due to tear gas shells. Methods: Eighteen patients with vascular injury caused by tear gas shells from 1 st Jan. 2008 to 31 st Dec 2009 were studied. Patients with vascular injuries caused by causes other than tear gas shells {{were excluded from the}} study. Results: All patients were treated with reverse saphenous vein graft as segmental loss was less than 2. 5 cm. Wound infection was the most common complication, followed by graft occlusion. Amputation rate was 16. 66 %. Associated nerve injury occurred in 44. 44 % of the patients. Conclusion: Tear gas shell injuries should not be taken lightly. They can cause <b>injuries</b> <b>as</b> <b>serious</b> <b>as</b> vascular injuries. Vascular injuries cased by tear gas shells require prompt revascularisation to improve limb salvage. De-spite proper revascularisation, patients have significant morbidity and need proper rehabilitation in the follow ups...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{describe}} the epidemiology of serious airgun injury in New Zealand. METHODS: Cases {{were selected from}} the New Zealand Health Information Service's hospital inpatient morbidity data files for the period 1979 to 1992 inclusive. RESULTS: There were 718 airgun related injuries resulting in 1. 56 injuries/ 100, 000 population/year. Males and 10 - 14 year olds had higher than average rates of injury. The majority of the incidents were unintentional. There has been a marked decline in injury rates since 1989. CONCLUSIONS: Airgun <b>injuries,</b> while not <b>as</b> <b>serious</b> <b>as</b> powder firearm <b>injuries,</b> account for a significant personal and societal burden. The results suggest that strategies aimed at controlling these injuries, especially those pertaining to children, {{are in need of}} review...|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, cheerleading was {{considered}} [...] {{one of the}} most dangerous school activities. The main source of injuries comes from stunting, also known as pyramids. These stunts are performed at games and pep rallies, as well as competitions. Sometimes competition routines are focused solely around the use of difficult and risky stunts. These stunts usually include a flyer (the person on top), along with one or two bases (the people on the bottom), and one or two spotters in the front and back on the bottom. The most common cheerleading related injury is a concussion. 96% of those concussions are stunt related. Others injuries are: sprained ankles, sprained wrists, back injuries, head injuries (sometimes concussions), broken arms, elbow injuries, knee injuries, broken noses, and broken collarbones. Sometimes, however, <b>injuries</b> can be <b>as</b> <b>serious</b> <b>as</b> whiplash, broken necks, broken vertebrae, and death.|$|R
50|$|On 27 July 2010, Snodgrass was {{believed}} to have suffered a serious knee injury during the pre-season game away to Norwegian team Brann after falling victim to a horrendous challenge by David Nielsen. The knee injury ruled {{him out of the}} rest of the pre-season campaign, but after two scans on the injured knee, the <b>injury</b> was not <b>as</b> <b>serious</b> <b>as</b> first feared, but kept Snodgrass out for several weeks. Manager Simon Grayson claimed that no exact timescale had been put on Snodgrass' recovery from injury. Snodgrass returned to training at the start of September 2010. To help gain match fitness after his injury, Snodgrass played 90 minutes in a closed-doors friendly against Middlesbrough. Snodgrass returned to Leeds' squad after injury when he was named on the bench the game against Doncaster Rovers, he came on as a second-half substitute replacing Ross McCormack.|$|R

5000|$|In July 2016, Mitchell {{joined the}} New York Knicks for the 2016 NBA Summer League. On August 30, 2016, {{he signed with}} the New Zealand Breakers for the 2016-17 NBL season. On January 26, 2017, Mitchell {{fell to the floor}} in agony early {{in the fourth quarter of}} the Breakers' 94-81 loss to the Cairns Taipans after what seemed to be an {{innocuous}} poke to the face while contesting a rebound with Taipans centre Nnanna Egwu resulted in his left eyeball coming out of its socket. Mitchell was taken to Auckland Hospital after the incident. Breakers general manager Dillon Boucher was advised by specialists that while there was some damage to his eye, [...] "the early reports are very positive that the <b>injury</b> is not <b>as</b> <b>serious</b> <b>as</b> first feared." [...] Mitchell was later discharged by specialists that night and reported having vision in the eye. On February 7, 2017, he returned to the US to seek further specialist advice on his injured eye.

25|$|The 1999–2000 season {{saw another}} change in {{management}} for Celtic. Former Liverpool and England international winger John Barnes replaced Vengloš to become {{manager at the}} club. The season started very brightly for Larsson as he notched up eight league goals in just nine games for the club. During Celtic's 1–0 defeat in a UEFA Cup tie against Lyon on 22 October 1999, Larsson suffered a career-threatening injury, breaking his leg in two places in a challenge with Serge Blanc. This resulted in him spending eight months on the sidelines, only returning {{on the last day}} of the 1999–2000 season. John Barnes cited Larsson's <b>injury</b> <b>as</b> being a significant factor in his sacking by Celtic after only months in the position. It was initially feared that Larsson had suffered a compound leg fracture, an injury which would normally result in an even longer absence – or possibly even end his professional career – but X-rays soon revealed that the <b>injury</b> was not <b>as</b> <b>serious</b> <b>as</b> originally feared. By the time Larsson had completed his rehabilitation, John Barnes had been sacked and replaced by director of football Kenny Dalglish as interim manager. Larsson made his comeback with a substitute appearance against Dundee United at Celtic Park on the final day of the SPL season.|$|R
50|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2011-12 season, Ribéry {{suffered}} an ankle injury during a pre-season training session, which resulted in the player being carried from the training ground by members of the club's medical team. Despite the player himself fearing he may have torn ligaments in the ankle, after an examination, club doctors revealed that the <b>injury</b> was not <b>as</b> <b>serious</b> <b>as</b> first thought, and Ribéry missed only one competitive match, a 3-0 DFP-Pokal away win over Eintracht Braunschweig on 1 August 2011. Ribéry made his season debut a week later in Bayern's opening league match of the season, playing the entire match in a 1-0 loss to Borussia Mönchengladbach. In the following week, he assisted on the game-winning goal, scored by Luiz Gustavo, in a win over VfL Wolfsburg. Ribéry scored his first goal of the campaign in the team's next league match against Hamburger SV. Bayern won the match 5-0. Following the international break, on 10 September, he scored a double and assisted on a goal in a 7-0 home victory over SC Freiburg. A week later, Ribéry assisted on both team goals in a shutout win over Schalke 04.Following the October international break, Ribéry manufactured another statistical output after scoring and assisting on two goals in a 4-0 win over Hertha BSC. On 29 October, he scored the game-winning goal in a 2-1 win over FC Augsburg. In the UEFA Champions League, Ribéry scored his first goal in the competition on 22 November against Spanish club Villarreal in the group stage. He scored one goal in each half to give Bayern a 3-1 win, which allowed the club progression to the UEFA Champions League knockout phase. On 3 December, Ribéry scored another set of goals in a 4-1 win against Werder Bremen. The league win re-inserted Bayern back into first-place position in the league after momentarily losing the spot in late November. After failing to score a goal in two months, on 8 February 2012 Ribéry scored the game-winning goal in a 2-0 win over VfB Stuttgart in the quarter-finals of the DFB-Pokal. The goal resulted in Ribéry scoring in every official competition Bayern Munich has participated in since he joined the club in 2007.|$|R
