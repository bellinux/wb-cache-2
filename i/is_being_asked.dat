Near {{the end of the}} film, she informs her commercially-minded boss of her plans to call out the senator's new strategy for what she feels is a ploy, but is shot down. Ultimately, Irving's version of the story is run without the critical interaction. Whether Roth gave in and toed the company line or quit her job is not clear.|$|E
25|$|The United States <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> by the European Union (EU) and the {{developing}} countries, led by Brazil and India, {{to make a}} more generous offer for reducing trade-distorting domestic support for agriculture. The United States is insisting that the EU and {{the developing}} countries agree to make more substantial reductions in tariffs and {{to limit the number}} of import-sensitive and special products that would be exempt from cuts. Import-sensitive products are of most concern to developed countries like the European Union, while developing countries are concerned with special products – those exempt from both tariff cuts and subsidy reductions because of development, food security, or livelihood considerations. Brazil has emphasized reductions in trade-distorting domestic subsidies, especially by the United States (some of which it successfully challenged in the WTO U.S.-Brazil cotton dispute), while India has insisted on a large number of special products that would not be exposed to wider market opening.|$|E
500|$|Astronaut Buzz Aldrin {{called the}} visual effects [...] "remarkable", and said, [...] "I was so extravagantly {{impressed}} by the portrayal {{of the reality of}} zero gravity. Going through the space station was done just the way that I've seen people do it in reality. The spinning is going to happen—maybe not quite that vigorous—but certainly we've been fortunate that people haven't been in those situations yet. I think it reminds us that there really are hazards in the space business, especially in activities outside the spacecraft." [...] Former NASA astronaut Garrett Reisman said, [...] "The pace and story was definitely engaging and I think it was the best use of the 3-D IMAX medium to date. Rather than using the medium as a gimmick, Gravity uses it to depict a real environment that is completely alien to most people. But the question that most people want me to answer is, how realistic was it? The very fact that the question <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> so earnestly {{is a testament to the}} verisimilitude of the movie. When a bad science fiction movie comes out, no one bothers to ask me if it reminded me of the real thing." ...|$|E

500|$|The video {{begins at}} a press conference where Spears, wearing a cropped Mickey Mouse top (paying homage to her days in The New Mickey Mouse Club), <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> {{inappropriate}} questions by news reporters, such as [...] "Is it true you banned junk food, smiles, candy, sunshine and laughter from your Femme Fatale tour?" [...] Angered by the questions, Spears replies (albeit censored): [...] "Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, you're cool, fuck you – I'm out", referencing a scene from the film Half Baked. After leaving the press conference, Spears walks out of the building and out into the street, wearing a white leather jacket and a black skirt with matching with studded combat boots. She signs a fan's copy of Femme Fatale and then blows a kiss to a baby as he whistles the melody of the chorus. As Spears walks along the street, she flashes several men, including a policeman (played by Adrien Galo). As a criminal offence, the policeman searches Spears, feeling up and down her legs, as she is bent over a car. Spears later walks away from the policeman, swinging handcuffs around her finger while he buttons his shirt.|$|E
500|$|Mahathir {{expressed}} {{discomfort with}} [...] "far too many non-Malay citizens who can swamp the Malays" [...] when [...] "...suddenly it has dawned upon the Malay that he cannot even call Malaya his land. There {{is no more}} Tanah Melayu — land of the Malays. He is now a different person, a Malaysian, but a Malay Malaysian whose authority in Malaya — his land — is now not only shared with others, but shared unequally. And {{as if this is}} not enough, he <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> to give up more and more of his share of influence." [...] Mahathir's defence of Malay rights focused both on the [...] "definitive people" [...] line of reasoning and the argument in favour of affirmative action, which the Reid Commission had chosen: [...] "It is not... for reasons of Malay superiority that preferential treatment for Malays in scholarship awards was insisted upon. ... They are a means of breaking down the superior position of the non-Malays in the field of education. The Malays are not proud of this treatment." [...] Shortly after becoming Prime Minister, Mahathir denied he had altered any of his views since he wrote the book.|$|E

The officer <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> to testify to what Monica said to prove that John attempted to murder Monica. Unless the attorney can show that this statement falls within an exception to the hearsay rule, the factfinder (the judge or jury) may not consider Monica's statement (this particular statement, however, would likely be admissible because of [...] "Excited Utterance" [...] and [...] "Present sense impression" [...] exceptions).|$|E

[...] Recording Industry Association of America President Cary Sherman noted that the major television networks supported the legislation but, unlike Wikipedia and Google, did not use their platforms to try to shape public opinion: [...] "when Wikipedia and Google purport to be neutral sources of information that is not only not neutral but affirmatively incomplete and misleading, they are duping their users into accepting as truth what are merely self-serving political declarations." ...|$|E

50|$|In the rebooted continuity, Fox is notably self-centered, {{as opposed}} to his {{previous}} depiction. He is much less motivated by any desire to resist tyranny, and more by revenge against Andross and money.

2500|$|The Kuvasz breed is for {{experienced}} handlers only. The {{combination of}} intelligence, independence and protectiveness make obedience training and socialization absolute necessities. They are strictly working dogs, bred for centuries to think independently and act without instruction, scanning and evaluating {{the environment and}} taking protective or deterrent action as needed. This was a vital trait in their solitary duties protecting livestock. That independence can make training a difficult task, wearing on the patience of even experienced owners. Kuvasz quickly understand what <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> of them, {{but they have to}} respect a person as a trusted leader before they'll obey commands. They're also not usually interested in meaningless activity, such as doing entertaining tricks. As a result, they are not recommended for novices {{and those who do not}} have time to train and socialize them properly. An adolescent Kuvasz should be able to learn basic obedience commands and consistently respond to them; however the instinctive need to investigate strangers and protect its owner may cause the Kuvasz to act independently when off leash and ignore the calls of a handler.|$|E
2500|$|In early 2003 he was {{reported}} {{to be one of the}} cabinet's chief opponents of military action against Iraq, and on 17 March he resigned from the Cabinet. In a statement giving his reasons for resigning he said, [...] "I can't accept collective responsibility for the decision to commit Britain now to military action in Iraq without international agreement or domestic support." [...] He also praised Blair's [...] "heroic efforts" [...] in pushing for the so-called second resolution regarding the Iraq disarmament crisis, but lamented [...] "The reality is that Britain <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> to embark on a war without agreement in any of the international bodies of which we are a leading partner—not NATO, not the European Union and, now, not the Security Council". Cook's resignation speech in the House of Commons received an unprecedented standing ovation by fellow MPs, was described by the BBC's Andrew Marr as [...] "without doubt one of the most effective, brilliant resignation speeches in modern British politics." [...] Most unusually for the British parliament, Cook's speech was met with growing applause from all sides of the House and from the public gallery. According to The Economists obituary, that was the first speech ever to receive a standing ovation in the history of the House.|$|E

6000|$|First, {{to begin}} with the trifle, note {{something}} slipshod and vague in the mere verbiage, typical of those who prefer a catchword to a creed. [...] "This cigarette business" [...] might mean anything. It might mean Messrs. Salmon and Gluckstein's business. But the pastor at Bromley will not interfere with that, for the indignation of his school of thought, even when it is sincere, always instinctively and unconsciously swerves aside from anything that is rich and powerful like the partners in a big business, and strikes instead something that is poor and nameless like the soldiers in a trench. Nor does the expression make clear who [...] "they" [...] are--whether the inhabitants of Britain or the inhabitants of Bromley, or the inhabitants of this one crazy tabernacle in Bromley; nor is it evident how {{it is going to be}} stopped or who <b>is</b> <b>being</b> <b>asked</b> to stop it. All these things are trifles compared to the more terrible offences of the phrase; but they are not without their social and historical interest. About the beginning of the nineteenth century the wealthy Puritan class, generally the class of the employers of labour, took a line of argument which was narrow, but not nonsensical. They saw the relation of rich and poor quite coldly as a contract, but they saw that a contract holds both ways. The Puritans of the middle class, in short, did in some sense start talking and thinking for themselves. They are still talking. They have long ago left off thinking. They talk about the loyalty of workmen to their employers, and God knows what rubbish; and the first small certainty about the reverend gentleman whose sentence I have quoted is that his brain stopped working as a clock stops, years and years ago.|$|E
