40|$|For micro gas {{turbines}} (MGT) of around 1 kW or less, a commercially suitable recuperator {{must be used}} to produce a thermal efficiency suitable for use in UK Domestic Combined Heat and Power (DCHP). This paper uses computational fluid dynamics (CFD) to investigate a recuperator design based on a helically coiled pipe-in-pipe heat exchanger which utilises industry standard stock materials and manufacturing techniques. A suitable mesh strategy was established by geometrically modelling separate boundary layer volumes to satisfy y + near wall conditions. A higher mesh density was then used to resolve the core flow. A coiled pipe-in-pipe recuperator solution for a 1 kW MGT DCHP unit was established within the volume envelope suitable for a domestic wall-hung boiler. Using a low MGT pressure ratio (necessitated by using a turbocharger oil cooled journal bearing platform) meant unit size was larger than anticipated. Raising MGT pressure ratio from 2. 15 to 2. 5 could significantly reduce recuperator volume. Dimensional reasoning confirmed the existence of optimum pipe diameter combinations for minimum pressure drop. Maximum heat exchanger effectiveness was achieved using an optimum or minimum pressure <b>drop</b> <b>pipe</b> combination with large pipe length {{as opposed to a}} large pressure <b>drop</b> <b>pipe</b> combination with shorter pipe length...|$|E

40|$|AbstractDrops {{are used}} to {{effectively}} dissipate the surplus energy of the water flow. A closed conduit drop conveys water and stills it at its downstream. I-type pipe drop is one kind of the closed conduit drops which is used in irrigation networks as a typical hydraulic structure. Sump elevation is an important design parameter for I-type pipe drop. Similarly, in supercritical flow structures, such as open channel chutes, determination of stilling basin invert elevation is very important. At present, these key design parameters {{are determined by the}} momentum and energy equations using tedious trial-and-error procedure. In this study, square conduit <b>drop,</b> <b>pipe</b> drop, and rectangular stilling basin are considered, and three explicit equations have been developed by (multiple) nonlinear regression technique to determine the sump and stilling basin invert elevations. Being very simple and accurate, these equations can be easily used to design the closed conduit drops and stilling basins by hydraulic engineers...|$|E
