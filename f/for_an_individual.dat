5|$|Alcoholism is characterised by an {{increased}} tolerance to alcohol–which means {{that an individual}} can consume more alcohol–and physical dependence on alcohol, which makes it hard <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking. Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A depressed mood is a common symptom of heavy alcohol drinkers.|$|E

5|$|Sleep {{deprivation}} and cumulative fatigue effects describe how individuals {{who fail to}} have an adequate period of sleep (78hours in 24hours) or who have been awake longer than the conventional 1617hours will suffer sleep deprivation. A sleep deficit accumulates with successive sleep-deprived days, and additional fatigue {{may be caused by}} breaking daily sleep into two shorter periods in place of a single unbroken period of sleep. A sleep deficit is not instantly reduced by one night's sleep; it may take two or three conventional sleep cycles <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> to return to unimpaired performance.|$|E

If the grant is approved, the individual then consults with heralds from the Authority to work out the design of their award. Upon completion of this process, the grant documents, in the form of letters patent, are created and provided to the grantee. The entire process is subject to certain fees required by the Government of Canada to cover costs of research and artwork; the fees are not to purchase the grant of arms. For corporations and institutions the process is similar.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{with other}} major {{periodicals}} of its day, the Analytical Review had a low circulation. While both the Tory Critical Review and the British Critic had {{a circulation of}} 3,500 by 1797 and the Monthly Review realized 5,000, Johnson and Christie's journal only ever achieved about 1,500. However, it was common practice during the eighteenth century <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> copy of each publication to be read by many different people. Scholars have estimated that each copy of a London newspaper, for example, was read by thirty people; coffeehouses and taverns were well-stocked with copies of newspapers and journals, as were circulating libraries. Hence, circulation numbers offer only a small glimpse into how many people actually read such publications.|$|E

5|$|Convict {{cichlids}} {{may show}} extended biparental care and adopt unrelated young {{of the same}} species of similar or smaller body size compared to their own biological offspring. The parents may benefit by adopting smaller young by taking advantage of the dilution effect, which is when the risk of predation <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> is reduced because the group size is larger. Another reason that has been considered is that foreign young that are larger than the biological offspring may be a direct predatory threat to them. However, {{it has been shown that}} as the biological offspring develop and become stronger swimmers, the parents are less active about rejecting larger foreign young, but when they do reject, often foreign young are rejected before they are large enough to be perceived as a direct threat to the biological offspring. Thus, it can be concluded that the brood adoption and rejection rely more heavily on the protection of the biological offspring from differential predator instead of from larger adopted cichlids.|$|E
5|$|Males display {{during the}} {{breeding}} season at a lek {{in a traditional}} open grassy arena. The ruff {{is one of the}} few lekking species in which the display is primarily directed at other males rather than to the females, and it is among the small percentage of birds in which the males have well-marked and inherited variations in plumage and mating behaviour. There are three male forms: the typical territorial males, satellite males which have a white neck ruff, and a very rare variant with female-like plumage. The behaviour and appearance <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> male remain constant through its adult life, and are determined by its genes (see §Biology of variation among males).|$|E
5|$|Queens {{mate with}} a single male and colonies may {{have more than one}} queen until the workers arrive, where they both exhibit antagonism. It takes around one or two months <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> egg to develop into an adult. Colonies range in size, varying between 11,000 {{individuals}} to over 300,000. The meat ant is a diurnal species (active throughout most of the day), especially when it is warm. It forages on trees and collect sweet substances such as honeydew and nectar, and also capture insects or collect the remains of animals. A number of predators eat these ants, including the short-beaked echidna (Tachyglossus aculeatus), numerous species of birds, blindsnakes and spiders. This species is also a competitor of the banded sugar ant (Camponotus consobrinus). Meat ants establish territorial borders with neighbouring colonies and solve disputes through ritualised fighting.|$|E

5|$|The Indian Ocean {{formed a}} vital part of Britain's trade links with the wider British Empire. India was {{controlled}} by the East India Company, a commercial organisation that maintained its own army and navy in Indian waters and owned a fleet of large merchant ships known as East Indiamen. These vessels ranged in size between 400 and 1500 tons burthen (bm), carried up to 30 cannons and were capable in certain conditions of fighting warships, although a frigate was usually more than a match <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> East Indiaman. These ships sailed on an annual route from China, the East Indies or India carrying trade goods such as spices, tea or silk to Britain. There the goods were sold, and replaced with general cargo including military equipment and troops for the journey back to the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The race's only {{individual}} {{time trial}} of an extensive length was held as an out-and-back loop around Villars-les-Dombes in the Ain department. The parcours of the -long stage was almost entirely flat. The stage finished at the Parc des Oiseaux, {{one of the}} largest ornithological parks in Europe. Race organisers had expected the quickest times for the course to be around forty minutes. Several of the general classification leaders regarded the time trial as a test <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>individual</b> time trial of similar length due to be held in July, at the Tour de France. As is customary in time trial stages, cyclists set off in reverse order from where they were ranked in the general classification {{at the end of the}} previous stage.
