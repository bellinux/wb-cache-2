Unbelted participants experienced either a constant delay of 8 seconds, or a variable delay of 8 seconds on average. A 16-second delay was introduced for those U.S. drivers who did not show significant improvement. Safety belt use increased from 48% to 67% for U.S. drivers and from 54% to 74% for Canadian drivers.

40|$|Background. Adolescent obesity {{calls for}} {{evidence-based}} treatment approaches given its long-term physical and psychosocial consequences. However, research shows {{there are many}} problems in the translation of scientific evidence into practice. Objective. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop science- and practice-based recommendations for the planning of future adolescent weight management interventions. Methods. We performed (i) literature reviews on <b>intervention</b> <b>studies</b> targeting treatment of obesity in adolescents and Dutch clinical guidelines for obesity as well as practice-based documents and grey literature on treating obesity and delivering health programs for adolescents and (ii) semi-structured interviews with eight clinicians and four non-clinicians working in obesity treatment, management and prevention to explore perspectives on treating adolescent obesity and using evidence in practice. Results. After merging the results from the literature reviews and interviews, four issues emerged: (i) little reporting on theoretical models used in <b>intervention</b> <b>studies,</b> Dutch clinical guidelines and semi-structured interviews; (ii) inconsistency on age-specific considerations for treating obesity in adolescents in <b>intervention</b> <b>studies</b> and Dutch clinical guidelines; (iii) inconsistency on addressing the social nature of obesity in <b>intervention</b> <b>studies</b> and Dutch clinical guidelines and (iv) how professional responsibility should be divided is unclear from <b>intervention</b> <b>studies,</b> Dutch clinical guidelines and semi-structured interviews. Conclusions. Joined action of science and practice is required for future interventions. Future interventions should include topics relevant to the stage of adolescence and give greater focus to the complex social nature of obesity.

40|$|Background: Supporting {{people after}} {{bereavement}} {{is a priority}} area for many health services. Investment in bereavement care must be supported by a rigorous evidence-base. Aim: To examine the (1) relative proportion of descriptive, measurement and intervention research in grief counselling and (2) quality and effectiveness of <b>intervention</b> <b>studies.</b> Design: Systematic review of studies published {{in the area of}} grief counselling. Data sources: MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane Library and PsycINFO databases were searched for studies published between 2000 and 2013. Eligible papers were categorised into descriptive, measurement, review, commentaries and <b>intervention</b> <b>studies.</b> <b>Intervention</b> <b>studies</b> were assessed against the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care methodological criteria, and papers meeting criteria were assessed for quality. The impact of interventions on grief, psychological morbidity and quality of life was examined. Results: A total of 126 data-based papers, including 47 descriptive, 3 measurement and 76 grief counselling <b>intervention</b> <b>studies</b> were included. Only 59 % (n = 45) of <b>intervention</b> <b>studies</b> met Effective Practice and Organisation of Care design criteria. Overall, study quality was poor, with the majority of interventions showing a risk of bias in several key areas. The three studies that met all criteria showed mixed effectiveness. Conclusion: Grief counselling interventions require a strong rationale for design, and a systematic approach to development and evaluation. Descriptive research efforts should inform this process, focusing on homogeneity in sample, identification of risk factors for complicated grief and the impact of extraneous factors on intervention effects. Interventions should include comparisons to usual care, as well as replication to confirm positive findings...|$|R
40|$|The way clinicians break {{bad news}} to cancer {{patients}} has been retrospectively associated with poor psychosocial outcomes for patients. Education {{and practice in}} breaking bad news may be ineffective for improving patients' well-being unless it is informed by a sound evidence base. In the health field, research efforts are expected to advance evidence over time to inform evidence-based practice. Key characteristics of an advancing evidence base are a predominance of new data, and rigorous <b>intervention</b> <b>studies</b> which prospectively demonstrate improved outcomes. This review aimed to examine {{the progress of the}} evidence base in breaking bad news to cancer patients. Manual and computer-based searches (Medline and PsycINFO) were performed to identify publications on the topic of breaking bad news to cancer patients published between January 1995 and March 2009. Relevant publications were coded in terms of whether they provided new data, examined psychosocial outcomes for patients or tested intervention strategies and whether <b>intervention</b> <b>studies</b> met criteria for design rigour. Of the 245 relevant publications, 55. 5 % provided new data and 16. 7 % were <b>intervention</b> <b>studies.</b> Much of the intervention effort was directed towards improving provider skills rather than patient outcomes (9. 8 % of studies). Less than 2 % of publications were rigorous <b>intervention</b> <b>studies</b> which addressed psychosocial outcomes for patients. Rigorous <b>intervention</b> <b>studies</b> which evaluate strategies for improving psychosocial outcomes in relation to breaking bad news to cancer patients are needed.

5000|$|From 1982 - 1989 Cullen {{served as}} Deputy Director of the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Division of Cancer Prevention and Control. Together with Dr. Peter Greenwald, the Director for the NCI Division of Cancer Prevention and Control, he {{established}} a new scientific approach to cancer control based upon a five-phase decision-making model: (1) hypothesis development, (2) method development, (3) controlled intervention trials, (4) defined population studies, and (5) demonstration and implementation studies. A major component of how this model was put into action at NCI was the new Smoking Tobacco and Cancer Program (STCP) which Cullen created in 1982. During his tenure at NCI, he was a vocal advocate for increasing program funding to develop and test intervention strategies to reduce tobacco use and then to apply the best strategies in large target populations. By 1989, the STCP included 55 smoking prevention and cessation trials, affecting 25 states and active in over 200 North American cities. [...] One of the major achievements of the STCP was {{the establishment of the}} American Stop Smoking <b>Intervention</b> <b>Study</b> for Cancer Prevention, widely known as ASSIST, which represented a major shift in federal funding for tobacco control from a primary focus on individuals to include a focus on the community and social environment. [...] Based upon the leadership of Cullen within NCI and Dr. Harmon J. Eyre, representing the American Cancer Society (ACS), and their presentations before the NCI's Board of Scientific Counselors, ASSIST was approved for funding in 1989 and launched in 1991 through a collaborative public/private partnership between NCI and the ACS. ASSIST funded 17 state health departments to conduct the first comprehensive tobacco prevention and control programs on a statewide basis. This seven-year demonstration project served as a model for national tobacco control efforts and led to the current National Tobacco Control Program administered by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Office on Smoking and Health, which continues to fund state health departments in all 50 states and the District of Columbia. [...] During the 1980s, Cullen developed a close working relationship with the Surgeon General C. Everett Koop. Cullen became a key technical consultant to Dr. Koop as he developed into an international leader in tobacco control. In part from the influence of Cullen, Dr. Koop issued a challenge to Americans in 1984 to [...] "create a smoke-free society in the United States by the year 2000." [...] In 1987, Cullen was awarded the Surgeon General's Medallion, the third highest award given by the Office of the Surgeon General for actions of exceptional achievement to the cause of public health and medicine.|$|E
