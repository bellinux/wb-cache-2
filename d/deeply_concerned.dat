5|$|One {{issue with}} which ML Pin was <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> {{was that of}} the country's teacher-training system, an issue he {{stressed}} during an audience with King Ananda Mahidol after the war in 1946, and would later address during his term as Permanent Secretary of Education.|$|E
5|$|Generals Alfred Keller and Adolf Galland had {{scheduled}} {{an inspection}} at Achmer {{for the afternoon}} of 7November1944. Galland had already visited Kommando Nowotny several times and was <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> over the high attrition rate and meager success achieved by the Me 262. After inspecting the two airfields at Achmer and Hesepe, {{he stayed in the}} Penterknapp barracks discussing the problems of the past few weeks. Several pilots openly expressed their doubts as to the readiness of the Me 262for combat operations.|$|E
5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to bribe his way free of his guards, Rupert was imprisoned in Linz. Lord Craven, also taken in the battle, {{attempted}} to persuade his captors {{to allow him to}} remain with Rupert, but was refused. Rupert's imprisonment was surrounded by religious overtones. His mother was <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> that he might be converted from Calvinism to Catholicism; his captors, encouraged by Emperor Ferdinand III, deployed Jesuit priests in an attempt to convert him. The Emperor went further, proffering the option of freedom, a position as an Imperial general and a small principality if Rupert would convert. Rupert refused.|$|E

These twins have command of their mutual legs turn about. Count Luigi is in command now; but at midnight, {{possession}} will pass to my principal, Count Angelo, and--well, you can foresee what will happen. He will march straight off the field, and carry Luigi with him." ...|$|R
5|$|The Spanish Crown was <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> {{with public}} health. Diseases had always troubled the colonies, and town councils spent money to bring {{physicians}} or sanitary equipment {{from other parts}} of the Americas. Reports by doctors about the sanitary and hygienic conditions of various neighborhoods of the cities were frequent. As a man of science, Eugenio Espejo demonstrated his knowledge of the latest scientific advances in Europe and the Americas. Most of the arguments and recommendations he made in his medical works can be found in contemporary sources, such as the Mémoires of the French Academy of Sciences.|$|E
5|$|After {{his first}} {{marriage}} Ambrose Dudley remained childless. His second wife, Elizabeth Tailboys, suffered a phantom pregnancy in 1555. Anne Russell, though nearly 20 years her husband's junior, {{turned out to be}} a congenial partner. Through their paternal grandmother the Dudley brothers descended from the famous 15th century earls, John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, and Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick. The Beauchamp descent especiallywhich was represented by the earldom of Warwickfilled them with pride. Ambrose's childlessness <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> the widowed Robert Dudley, who for many years dared not to remarry for fear of the Queen's displeasure, and eventually died without direct heirs himself in September 1588. Most of Leicester's estateand debtspassed on to Warwick and encumbered his remaining lifetime. He also took care of his deceased brother's illegitimate teenage son Robert, who was his godson and whom Leicester had willed to inherit after Warwick's death.|$|E
5|$|Rather than {{deploying}} Belgian troops {{against the}} mutineers as Janssens had wished, Lumumba dismissed him and renamed the Force Publique the Armée Nationale Congolaise (ANC). All black soldiers were promoted {{by at least}} one rank. Victor Lundula was promoted directly from sergeant-major to major-general and head of the army, replacing Janssens. At the same time, Joseph-Désiré Mobutu, an ex-sergeant-major and close personal aide of Lumumba, became Lundula's deputy as army chief of staff. The government attempted to stop the revolt—Lumumba and Kasa-Vubu intervened personally at Léopoldville and Thysville and persuaded the mutineers to lay down their arms—but in most of the country the mutiny intensified. White officers and civilians were attacked, white-owned properties were looted and white women were raped. The Belgian government became <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> by the situation, particularly when white civilians began entering neighbouring countries as refugees.|$|E

"I {{know what}} you refer to," [...] said Mr. Philip, cutting me short rather abruptly; [...] "and I must beg, for reasons which will {{presently}} appear, that you will make no statement of any sort to me until you have first heard what I have to say.

5000|$|In January 2017, Obernolte {{released}} a statement on his opposition to Xavier Becerra's nomination as California's Attorney General stating, [...] "While Congressman Becerra possesses many of the qualifications necessary in an Attorney General, many of his positions on constitutional issues <b>deeply</b> <b>concern</b> me. His stances on both the First and Second Amendments clearly don't align with my values or those of my constituents. California's Attorney General should be committed to protecting these Constitutional rights." ...|$|R

You have as yet spoken of {{yourself}} only--an important and worthy subject doubtless, but which, perhaps, does not altogether so <b>deeply</b> <b>concern</b> me that I should postpone my repose to hear it. Spare me further prelude, sir, {{and speak to}} the purpose if indeed you have aught to say that concerns me. When you have done, I, in my turn, have something to communicate." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{government}} remained <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> {{about the}} Bolshevik threat, and in May 1919 the Winnipeg General Strike broke out, creating a national crisis which ministers feared {{would lead to}} a revolution. The mounted police were deployed to maintain public order and generate intelligence on the strikers; 245 mounted police were sent into the city, supported by four machine guns mounted on lorries. On June 21, which became known as Bloody Saturday, military veterans marched through the city in support of the strikers; the authorities called in the mounted police to break up the marchers. By the time the police arrived, the protesters had begun to riot and the police carried out two mounted charges. The police then concluded that they were losing control of the situation and fired their revolvers into the crowd, killing one man and injuring others. The marchers fled and the strike collapsed.|$|E
5|$|Hitler was <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> that Ernst Röhm, {{the chief}} of the SA, was {{planning}} a coup. Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich plotted with Göring to use the Gestapo and SS to crush the SA. Members of the SA got wind of the proposed action and thousands of them took to the streets in violent demonstrations on the night of 29 June 1934. Enraged, Hitler ordered the arrest of the SA leadership. Röhm was shot dead in his cell when he refused to commit suicide; Göring personally went over the lists of detainees—numbering in the thousands—and determined who else should be shot. At least 85 people were killed in the period of 30 June to 2 July, which is now known as the Night of the Long Knives. Hitler admitted in the Reichstag on 13 July that the killings had been entirely illegal, but claimed a plot had been under way to overthrow the Reich. A retroactive law was passed making the action legal. Any criticism was met with arrests.|$|E

60|$|Let it not {{be thought}} unbecoming in a layman to have treated at length a subject with which the clergy are more intimately conversant. All may, without impropriety, speak of what <b>deeply</b> <b>concerns</b> all: nor need an apology be offered for going over ground which has been trod before so ably and so often: without pretending, however, to any thing of novelty, either in matter or manner, {{something}} may have been offered to view, which will save the writer from the imputation of having little to recommend his labour, but goodness of intention.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{independent}} {{reports by}} Hampshire Constabulary and North Yorkshire Police criticised {{the decision to}} return his firearms, which prompted the IPCC to launch an independent investigation. This investigation concluded in February 2016 and it published its findings in a 73-page report in April 2017. IPCC associate commissioner Tom Milsom said: [...] "Our investigation paints a <b>deeply</b> <b>concerning</b> portrait of how Surrey Police's firearms licensing team operated at that time. We found a unit which lacked the necessary training and processes to manage such a serious responsibility, staffed by individuals who were failing to undertake their duties with rigour and due consideration." ...|$|R

25|$|The provincial {{government}} approved a 3600MW coal-fueled thermalelectrical plant in Vĩnh Sơn village, Quảng Đông commune, Quảng Trạch District, 40km northeast of this national park. This project has <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> many environmentalists {{as it will}} probably cause {{air and water pollution}} to the park. Wildfire during the dry season is a recurring threat to the forest.|$|E
25|$|As Gibbons was {{campaigning for}} {{governor}} in October 2006, it was brought to light that {{more than ten years}} earlier, his wife Dawn had employed Martha Patricia Pastor Sandoval, a then-illegal immigrant from Peru, as a housekeeper and babysitter. Since the Nannygate matter of 1993, politicians have been <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> about the impact of such revelations on their careers.|$|E
60|$|It {{seems to}} me very {{important}} that the statute laws should be made as plain and intelligible as possible, and be reduced to as small a compass as may consist with the fullness and precision of the will of the Legislature and the perspicuity of its language. This well done would, I think, greatly facilitate the labors of those whose duty it is to assist in the administration of the laws, and would be a lasting benefit to the people, by placing before them in a more accessible and intelligible form the laws which so <b>deeply</b> <b>concern</b> their interests and their duties.|$|R
40|$|After the Tokyo Electric Power Company Fukushima Daiichi {{nuclear power}} plant accident, cancer risk from low-dose {{radiation}} exposure has been <b>deeply</b> <b>concerning.</b> The linear no-threshold model is applied {{for the purpose of}} radiation protection, but it is a model based on the concept that ionizing radiation induces stochastic oncogenic alterations in the target cells. As the elucidation of the mechanism of radiation-induced carcinogenesis is indispensable to justify the concept, studies aimed at the determination of molecular changes associated with thyroid cancers among children who suffered effects from the Chernobyl nuclear accident will be overviewed. We intend to discuss whether any radiation signatures are associated with radiation-induced childhood thyroid cancers...|$|R
40|$|Although {{facial nerve}} palsy occurs less {{frequently}} in children than in adults, {{the condition is}} <b>deeply</b> <b>concerning</b> to the patient and family. Whereas facial nerve palsy is most often idiopathic in the adult population, a secondary cause can now be identified {{in the majority of}} pediatric cases. Pediatricians are, therefore, ideally situated to detect these individuals at an early stage and initiate optimal diagnostic and therapeutic interventions. Proper evidence-based care can optimize the outcomes in these patients. This review provides an overview of the anatomical and pathophysiological considerations in facial nerve palsy and describes the current management principles to assist pediatricians in the diagnosis and treatment of this condition...|$|R
25|$|Later that year, Dato' Kelana Sendeng died. In early 1873, Sayid Abdul Rahman {{took his}} place, {{becoming}} the new Dato' Kelana. The death however did not repair {{the relationship between}} Dato' Kelana and Dato' Bandar. On the contrary, it deteriorated. The new Dato' Kelana was <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> with Dato' Bandar's unchecked influence, and sought ways to counter his adversary's power.|$|E
25|$|<b>Deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> over {{cross-border}} ethnic ties {{of national}} minorities (such as Germans, Poles, Finns), in 1934 the Soviet Union {{decided to create}} a new border security zone along its western border, and in 1935–1937 potentially disloyal nationalities (including German) were mostly (albeit not completely) deported from this strip of land to the inner parts of the Soviet Union by NKVD. German national institutions were gradually abolished.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{to their}} {{counterparts}} among Javanese Hindus, many Dayak leaders {{were also more}} <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> about Balinese efforts to standardize Hindu ritual practice nationally; fearing a decline of their own unique 'Hindu Kaharingan' traditions and renewed external domination. By contrast, most Javanese were slow to consider Hinduism at the time, lacking a distinct organization along ethnic lines and fearing retribution from locally powerful Islamic organizations like the Nahdatul Ulama (NU).|$|E
40|$|This is a polemical {{book that}} {{maintains}} an age-old argument frequently {{cited in the}} debates concerning ownership of the past. As a museum professional with a wealth of experience, James Cuno confidently asserts {{his belief in the}} 'encyclopaedic museum' concept, where museums are seen as institutions that display collections of antiquities as representative examples of the world's artistic legacy. Threats to the encyclopaedic museum, in the form of laws concerning the return of cultural property, <b>deeply</b> <b>concern</b> Cuno, and his fervent belief in the idea that antiquities are the common inheritance of all peoples leads him to challenge the nationalist claims on heritage by modern nation-states...|$|R
50|$|Kelson {{plans to}} set the Haldane {{potential}} in his uncle, Prince Nigel Haldane, before his departure, ensuring that his family's legacy of magic will not perish if Kelson should not survive the war. However, Kelson's plan <b>deeply</b> <b>concerns</b> the Camberian Council, who has long believed that multiple Haldanes cannot wield the Haldane magic simultaneously. Further complicating matters is the ill-timed return of Kelson's mother, Queen Jehana, whose anti-Deryni sentiments cause considerable friction with her son. Nonetheless, Kelson carries through with his plan and sets the Haldane potential in his uncle. The following day, Kelson sends off {{the first half of}} his army, placing it under the command of Bishop Duncan McLain and Earl Dhugal MacArdry.|$|R
50|$|King Cinhil Haldane is dying, a fact which <b>deeply</b> <b>concerns</b> Camber and his family. Although Cinhil {{himself has}} never truly {{overcome}} his distrust of Deryni powers, {{he has kept}} the peace between the races throughout his reign, due largely to his close friendship with the man he believes to be Alister Cullen. However, with Cinhil's death fast approaching, Camber realizes that the ambitious human lords at court will {{soon be able to}} wage open war on Deryni throughout the kingdom. Prince Alroy Haldane, Cinhil's eldest son and heir, is a sickly twelve-year-old boy, and Camber knows all too well that the Regency Council that will control the throne during Alroy's minority will not treat Deryni kindly.|$|R
25|$|Powerful condemnations of {{political}} Zionism {{continued into the}} twentieth century. In 1903, Rabbi Sholom Dovber Schneersohn of Lubavitch published Kuntres Uma'ayan, which contained a strong polemic against Zionism. He opposed the Religious Zionist movement and was <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> that secular nationalism would replace Judaism {{as the foundation of}} Jewish identity. Rabbi Baruch Halberstam (d. 1906) took a leading role in opposing Zionism, in line with the position held by his father, Hayyim Halberstam of Sanz.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2007, Emilio Alvarez Icaza Longoria (chairman of the Human Rights Commission of Mexico City) {{said he was}} <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> that Mexico City had {{the worst}} record for {{homophobic}} hate crimes, with 137 such crimes reported between 1995 and 2005. Journalist and author (Homophobia, Hate, Crime and Justice 1995–2005) Fernando del Collado affirmed that during the decade covered by his book, 387 hate crimes due to homophobia were committed in Mexico (98 percent of which remain unprosecuted).|$|E
25|$|Military service {{sharpened}} Nelson's {{identity as}} an American and his patriotism. He was <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> {{about what he}} considered the ambivalent attitude among Norwegian-American Lutheran clergy toward slavery, and thought that too few of his fellow Norwegian Americans from Koshkonong had volunteered. He read the Norwegian translation of Esaias Tegnér's Friðþjófs saga ins frœkna and found it enthralling. Its unsentimental depiction of character and virtue he {{found to be a}} synthesis of his Norwegian heritage and American home.|$|E
50|$|Sara Hiom of Cancer Research UK said, ‘The {{state of}} NHS {{diagnostic}} services is <b>deeply</b> <b>concerning</b> - and new GP referral guidelines from NICE mean that even more patients {{will be waiting}} for these tests. There aren’t enough trained staff, they’re often reliant on outdated equipment {{and in many cases}} they’re already operating services seven days a week.' Dr Giles Maskell of the Royal College of Radiologists said, ‘Well-resourced testing services are crucial to the early diagnosis of cancer, which in turn is vital to increase survival from the disease.' Cancer Research UK is calling on the government to provide funding for earlier diagnosis of cancer as prompt diagnosis increases the chances the patient will survive.|$|R
50|$|The dances in Indonesia {{reflects}} its {{diverse and}} long history. Several royal houses; the istanas and keratons still survived {{in some parts}} of Indonesia and become the haven of cultural conservation. The obvious difference between courtly dance and common folk dance traditions is the most evident in Javanese dance. Javanese stratified social class is reflected in its culture, where the upper noble class are more concentrated and <b>deeply</b> <b>concern</b> with refinement, spiritual and sophistication; while the commoners are usually more interested in entertainment and social value of the dance. As the result court dances are often have strict rules and disciplines preserved through generations, while folk dances are more liberated and open to any influences.|$|R
