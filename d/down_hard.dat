5|$|At {{this point}} Díaz {{tried to come}} to terms with Madero, {{particularly}} after the capture of Cuautla by the Zapatistas in south-central Mexico. Together with his finance minister and main advisor, José Yves Limantour, Díaz planned to make concessions to the fairly moderate Madero and, once Madero was pacified, crack <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> on the more radical elements among the rebels. A truce was agreed to on April 23.|$|E
5|$|As soon as {{he could}} walk, Braille spent time playing in his father's workshop. At the age of three, the child was playing with some of the tools, trying to make holes in a piece of leather with an awl. Squinting closely at the surface, he pressed <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> to drive the point in, and the awl glanced across the tough leather and struck him in one of his eyes. A local {{physician}} bound and patched the affected eye and even arranged for Braille to be met the next day in Paris by a surgeon, but no treatment could save the damaged organ. In agony, the young boy suffered for weeks as the wound became severely infected; an infection which then spread to his other eye, likely due to sympathetic ophthalmia.|$|E
5|$|At {{the final}} whistle, Van Nistelrooy was {{immediately}} confronted by Arsenal players Martin Keown, Lauren, Ray Parlour, Ashley Cole and Kolo Touré. Keown jumped {{up next to}} Van Nistelrooy and brought his arms <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> on the Dutchman's back, while Lauren pushed Van Nistelrooy {{in the back and}} Parlour and Cole offered verbal abuse. Van Nistelrooy did not react and was escorted away by Manchester United captain Roy Keane, but the incident escalated away from the two of them. In defence of their teammate, Manchester United players Ryan Giggs, Cristiano Ronaldo, Gary Neville, Mikaël Silvestre, Quinton Fortune and Rio Ferdinand also became involved in the situation.|$|E

5|$|In 1995, Toriyama {{detailed}} the equipment he used for Dragon Ball. He used a G-pen nib by Zebra, usually getting three chapters {{out of one}} because he typically does not press <b>down</b> <b>hard.</b> Toriyama used black drawing ink made by Pilot, but his color ink was produced by Luma and applied with a ten-year-old fine point Tenshōdō brush. His whiteout was also made by Luma. He received free Kent paper, similar to Bristol board, from a seller connected to Shueisha, and used a 0.5mm 2B lead mechanical pencil and a wide ruler at least 30cm long.|$|E
5|$|One of the Smith government's first actions was {{to crack}} <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> {{on the black}} {{nationalist}} political violence that had erupted following {{the establishment of a}} second black nationalist organisation, the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), by disgruntled ZAPU members in Tanzania in August 1963. The rival movements were split tribally, ZAPU being mostly Ndebele and ZANU predominantly Shona, and politically—ZAPU, which had relabelled itself the People's Caretaker Council (PCC) within Southern Rhodesia to circumvent its ban, was Marxist–Leninist and backed by the Warsaw Pact and its allies, while ZANU had aligned itself with Maoism and the bloc headed by communist China. Their respective supporters in the black townships clashed constantly, also targeting non-aligned blacks whom they hoped to recruit, and sporadically attacked whites, businesses and police stations.|$|E
5|$|ZAPU members {{attempted}} to bomb or burn down {{the houses of}} blacks who joined or supported white-led political parties, {{as well as the}} churches they attended. Rival nationalists also used violence against each other as they jostled for prominence. In an attempt to restore confidence in the government and end the political intimidation, Smith cracked <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> on the militant nationalists, arresting political agitators in the townships for criminal offences and jailing ZAPU leader Joshua Nkomo in Gonakudzingwa Restriction Camp, a remote detention unit in the country's south-east. The British government, worried that Southern Rhodesia might issue a unilateral declaration of independence (UDI) rather than continue with negotiations, placed troops in Aden on alert.|$|E
50|$|The Committee to Protect Journalists {{expressed}} concern about the deterioration of press freedom in lead up to the election. Reporters without Borders also placed Egypt in the bottom 35 of 175 countries regarding press freedom. While, local journalists said the government has cracked <b>down</b> <b>harder</b> on the press.|$|R
60|$|Matt at once stopped driving, and {{adjusted}} the rubber blanket {{in front of}} his seat. This was no easy job, for the wind kept increasing in violence. He had barely completed the work when there came a crash of thunder, and then the rain came <b>down</b> <b>harder</b> than ever.|$|R
60|$|All {{around him}} were the vast and mysterious fields {{of ice and}} snow. Far off {{he could hear the}} barking of the dogs, but this soon died out, and then came utter silence--a silence that seemed to fairly weigh him down.

5|$|In {{spite of}} the success of the tour, the band was not without at least one serious altercation which has since been widely publicized. After playing a {{sell-out}} show in Glasgow, Scotland, members of the band and crew were involved in heavy drinking. After a brief amount of time, vocalist Randy Blythe, whilst wearing a quilt and attempting to speak with a Scottish accent, became verbally violent towards both drummer Chris Adler and guitarist Mark Morton, the later of whom then struck Blythe from behind on the bus in response. The incident developed into grabbing, pushing and separating until Blythe and Morton then encountered each other outside on the footpath. The fight between the two was especially lackluster due to intoxication, however it resulted in Morton bringing Blythe <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> on the pavement beneath him briefly incapacitating Blythe. Two days and at least one show later, the duo reconciled over drinks.|$|E
5|$|The city {{authorities}} {{proceeded to}} punish severely {{the leaders of}} the Huttwil League. Bern did not accept the terms of the peace of Melligen with its amnesty, claiming the treaty was invalid on its territory, and cracked <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> on the rural population. The peasants were fined large sums and were made to cover the expenses for the military operations. The peace of the Murifeld was declared null and void by the Bernese city council, as was the Huttwil League. The rural population was disarmed. Many of the exponents of the movement were incarcerated, tortured, and finally sentenced to death or to hard labour on galleys, or exiled. Christian Schybi was executed at Sursee on July 9, 1653. Niklaus Leuenberger was beheaded and quartered at Bern on September 6, 1653; his head was nailed at the gallows together with one of the four copies of the Bundesbrief of the Huttwil League. Punishment was hardest in the canton of Bern, where 23 death sentences were handed down and numerous other prominent peasants were executed in courts-martial by von Erlach's army, compared to eight and seven death sentences in Lucerne and Basel, respectively.|$|E
5|$|While Noriega {{was out of}} the country, Díaz Herrera {{considered}} {{using the}} uproar around Spadafora to seize power, but despite mobilizing some troops, eventually decided against following through with the coup, realizing he could not count on sufficient support. Furthermore, Noriega had made a deal with his deputy, to the effect that he would step down as military leader in 1987 and allow Díaz Herrera to succeed him. In 1987, however, Noriega went back on this agreement, announced he would be heading the military for the next five years, and assigned Herrera to a diplomatic post. Díaz Herrera retaliated by making public statements accusing Noriega of rigging the 1984 election, murdering Spadafora, and of trafficking in drugs, as well as of assassinating Torrijo with a bomb on his plane. These statements provoked huge protests against Noriega, with 100,000 people, approximately 25% of the population of Panama City, marching in protest on June 26, 1987. Noriega charged Herrera with treason, and cracked <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> on the protesters. The U.S. Senate passed a resolution asking Noriega to step down until Herrera could be tried; in response Noriega sent government workers to protest outside the U.S. embassy, a protest which quickly turned into a riot. As a result, the U.S. suspended all military assistance to Panama, and the CIA stopped paying Noriega a salary. The Senate resolution had the effect of identifying the U.S. with the effort to remove Noriega; Noriega exploited the rising anti-American sentiment to strengthen his own position. Without the support of the U.S., Panama defaulted on its international debt, and that year the country's economy shrunk by 20%. However, though the U.S. considered not recognizing the new president, the state department decided not to do so, as that would amount to breaking relations with Noriega.|$|E
50|$|Beginning 90 {{million years}} ago the North <b>Downs</b> <b>hard</b> chalk was deposited, a white {{limestone}} comprising over 95% calcium carbonate. This contains thin beds of marl and nodules of flint, either scattered or in bands. The North Downs extending from Farnham to Dover, Kent are formed by this chalk.

25|$|In {{the wake}} of the Jellaz Incident, the French {{authorities}} imposed martial law on Tunis for almost a decade. Within months however, popular discontent manifested itself in the Tunis Tram Boycott. In response the authorities clamped <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> on the Young Tunisian movement several of whose leaders were exiled from the country. After this the movement, which had generally sought to work for the advancement of Tunisia in collaboration with France, became disillusioned with this approach. When the leaders returned form exile, they took a different political approach and founded the Destour party in 1920.|$|E
50|$|The most {{dangerous}} pilot-induced oscillations can occur during landing. Too much up elevator during the flare {{can result in}} the plane getting dangerously slow and threatening to stall. A natural reaction to this is to push the nose <b>down</b> <b>harder</b> than one pulled it up, but then the pilot ends up staring at the ground. An even larger amount of up elevator starts the cycle over again.|$|R

25|$|Originally a {{bodyguard}} of Charles V of Spain, {{he was sent}} to Mexico to counterbalance the influence of the leader of the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire, Hernán Cortés, since the King worried he was becoming too powerful. As Governor of Pánuco, Guzmán cracked <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> on the supporters of Cortés, stripping him and his supporters of property and rights. He conducted numerous expeditions of conquest into the northwestern areas of Mexico, enslaving thousands of Indians and shipping them to the Caribbean colonies. In the resulting power struggles where he also made himself an enemy of important churchmen, Guzmán came out the loser.|$|E
25|$|When I saw Going My Way I was as {{moved as}} they were by the {{character}} he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> on the kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, {{took them to the}} ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over. All {{the way back to the}} house I thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and the one I knew at home.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{aircraft}}'s many faults, {{only two}} {{were lost in}} accidents. The seventh aircraft (38-492) was on its final test flight from the Buffalo factory prior to delivery to the Air Corps when pilot John Strickler, a Bell pilot and engineer/co-pilot Brian Sparks, who was Bell's chief test pilot at the time, encountered problems recovering from a deliberate spin attempt {{which was part of}} the test flight profile. Despite every effort to emerge from the spin, the aircraft would not respond, and it appeared that the rudder had locked. Co-pilot Sparks shut down the engines and waited for the propellers to come to a stop before bailing out. Because of the tandem seating, it was necessary for Sparks to exit the aircraft first, and in doing so he struck the empennage, breaking his legs — and in the process, freeing the rudder. Strickler decided to stay with the aircraft and attempt an emergency landing. By this time, the aircraft had lost sufficient altitude that there was not time to restart the engines. Strickler put the Airacuda <b>down</b> <b>hard</b> in a farmer's field, and walked away unhurt. The Airacuda was so badly damaged it had to be scrapped.|$|E
