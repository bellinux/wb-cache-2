5|$|The castle's fourth corner forms its <b>gatehouse.</b> Here {{the classic}} Edwardian <b>gatehouse</b> design has been {{transformed}} into an asymmetrical structure, with one tower much larger than the other. The <b>gatehouse</b> included portcullises, murder-holes and a drawbridge. Beyond the <b>gatehouse</b> lies a large barbican, inspired by a similar design of the period at the Tower of London and possibly built by the same workmen, designed to protect the causeway leading to the <b>gatehouse.</b> The barbican today is only half of its original height, and includes its own gate, designed to trap intruders within the inner defences. The <b>gatehouse</b> and barbican are linked by a stone causeway.|$|E
5|$|Access to {{the central}} island {{occurred}} over a drawbridge, through a pair of gatehouses on the eastern side. Caerphilly Castle's Inner East <b>Gatehouse,</b> based on the <b>gatehouse</b> built at Tonbridge in the 1250s, reinforced a trend in <b>gatehouse</b> design across England and Wales. Sometimes termed a keep-gatehouse, the fortification had both exterior and interior defences, enabling it to be defended even if {{the perimeter of the}} castle was breached. Two huge towers flanked the <b>gatehouse</b> on either side of an entrance that was protected by portcullises and murder-holes. The substantial size of the <b>gatehouse</b> allowed it to be used for accommodation as well as defence and it was comfortably equipped on a grand scale, probably {{for the use of the}} castle constable and his family. Another pair of gatehouses protected the west side.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{visitors}} typically {{enter the}} house from the High Street to the south, passing through the <b>gatehouse,</b> across the lower courtyard into the hall of the main building. Plas Mawr's <b>gatehouse</b> was only the third such entrance building {{to be built in}} North Wales, despite gatehouses being an important part of English Elizabethan architecture, designed to show off the house and provide a suitably dignified entry for visitors. Few houses in towns had the physical space for a <b>gatehouse</b> like Plas Mawr's. Originally, the <b>gatehouse</b> would have contained a suite of rooms for the steward of the house, Richard Wynn.|$|E

5000|$|Sometimes <b>gatehouses</b> formed {{part of town}} fortifications, perhaps {{defending}} {{the passage of a}} bridge across a river or a moat, as Monnow Bridge in Monmouth. York has four important <b>gatehouses,</b> known as [...] "Bars", in its city walls. One such is Micklegate Bar.|$|R
5|$|The <b>gatehouse</b> in the castle's north wall {{is three}} storeys high; now reached by a static bridge, it was {{originally}} connected to the barbican by a drawbridge. The top of the <b>gatehouse</b> is machicolated, and the approach is overlooked by gun-loops in the <b>gatehouse</b> towers. The <b>gatehouse</b> is {{the only part of}} the castle which has gun-loops, and the curtain wall and towers are studded with windows for domestic use rather than military. There are guardrooms on the ground floor and a basement beneath them. The passage would originally have had three wooden portcullises. Above the entrance passage is an arch in the gateway, although it leads nowhere. The ceiling of the passage through the <b>gatehouse</b> into the castle is vaulted and pierced with murder-holes. Murder-holes were most likely used to drop objects on attackers, similar to machicolations, or to pour water to extinguish fires.|$|E
5|$|The three-storey <b>gatehouse</b> to Raglan Castle {{dates from}} the 1460s and is {{approached}} over a stone bridge restored in 1949. Characterised by extensive machicolations and gunloops, the <b>gatehouse</b> would originally have had a twin-set of portcullises and a drawbridge. The intention of the design was at least partially defensive, but was also intended to provide a dramatic and impressive entrance for senior visitors to the castle. The {{upper part of the}} <b>gatehouse</b> provided chambers for the constable of the castle. Immediately {{to the west of the}} <b>gatehouse</b> was the castle library, once famous for its collection of Welsh literature. On the east side of the <b>gatehouse</b> is the three-storey Closet Tower; this was designed to be integral to the <b>gatehouse,</b> and may have contained the original castle treasury, conveniently accessible by the constable. The Closet Tower was partly altered in later years, possibly to allow the basement to be used as a magazine in the English Civil War.|$|E
5|$|The western {{entrance}} to the Middle Ward is now open, and a gateway leads north from the ward onto the North Terrace. The eastern exit from the ward is guarded by the Norman <b>Gatehouse.</b> This <b>gatehouse,</b> which, despite its name, dates from the 14th century, is heavily vaulted and decorated with carvings, including surviving medieval lion masks, traditional symbols of majesty, to form an impressive {{entrance to}} the Upper Ward. Wyatville redesigned {{the exterior of the}} <b>gatehouse,</b> and the interior was later heavily converted in the 19th century for residential use.|$|E

5|$|At 3:50 pm {{the prisoners}} left H7, {{and the driver}} and a prison orderly were taken back to the lorry, and the driver's foot tied to the clutch. 37 prisoners climbed {{into the back of}} the lorry, while Kelly lay on the floor of the cab with a gun pointed at the driver, who was also told the cab had been booby trapped with a hand grenade. At nearly 4:00 pm the lorry drove towards the main gate of the prison, where the prisoners {{intended}} to take over the <b>gatehouse.</b> Ten prisoners dressed in guards' uniforms and armed with guns and chisels dismounted from the lorry and entered the <b>gatehouse,</b> where they took the officers hostage. At 4:05 pm the officers began to resist, and an officer pressed an alarm button. When other staff responded via an intercom, a senior officer said while being held at gunpoint that the alarm had been triggered accidentally. By this time the prisoners were struggling to maintain control in the <b>gatehouse</b> due to the number of hostages. Officers arriving for work were entering the <b>gatehouse</b> from outside the prison, and each was ordered at gunpoint to join the other hostages. Officer James Ferris ran from the <b>gatehouse</b> towards the pedestrian gate attempting to raise the alarm, pursued by Dermot Finucane. Ferris had already been stabbed three times in the chest, and before he could raise the alarm he collapsed.|$|E
5|$|From 1889 to 1902, an {{extensive}} programme of conservation {{was carried out}} on the bridge and gate, directed by Monmouthshire County Council, which retained responsibility for maintenance. This began with the prevention of the potential collapse of the <b>gatehouse</b> by the insertion of metal tie rods to hold the two faces of the tower together; the four round plates {{at the ends of}} these two rods can still be seen. In 1892, conservation work began on the arches and piers of the bridge following the discovery that riverbed erosion had seriously undermined the piers. Maintenance was carried out on the <b>gatehouse</b> exterior from the mid-1890s to 1897. Roof guttering and downpipes were added, badly eroded stone was replaced with squared blocks of Old Red Sandstone, and the cruciform arrowslit on the left-hand side of the west elevation of the <b>gatehouse</b> was restored to make it symmetrical. Concluding the 1889–1902 renovations, improvements were made to the interior of the <b>gatehouse,</b> and it was opened to the public in 1902.|$|E

5|$|In 1900, {{ownership}} of the <b>gatehouse</b> was transferred from Henry Somerset, 9th Duke of Beaufort to Monmouthshire County Council {{as part of the}} disposal of the entirety of the Somersets' land holdings in Monmouthshire. The gift is recorded on a brass plaque attached to the <b>gatehouse.</b> The local antiquarian Mary Ellen Bagnall-Oakeley wrote the first history of the bridge and <b>gatehouse,</b> Monnow Bridge Tower, which appeared in 1903. In April 1893, the first street light had been erected on the bridge by the town council. In the late 1920s, the top portion of this light was replaced by twin electric lamps. In the 1960s, the lamps were removed completely, and since 1991 the bridge has been floodlit.|$|E

5|$|Leicester's <b>gatehouse</b> {{was built}} {{on the north side of}} the base court, {{replacing}} an older <b>gatehouse</b> to provide a fashionable entrance from the direction of Coventry. The external design, with its symbolic towers and, originally, battlements, echoes a style popular a century or more before, closely resembling Kirby Muxloe and the Beauchamp <b>gatehouse</b> at Warwick Castle. By contrast the interior, with its contemporary wood panelling, is in the same, highly contemporary Elizabethan fashion of Leicester's building in the inner court. Leicester's <b>gatehouse</b> is one of the few parts of the castle to remain intact. The stables built by John Dudley in the 1550s also survive and lie along the east side of the base court. The stable block is a large building built mostly in stone, but with a timber-framed, decoratively panelled first storey designed in an anachronistic, vernacular style. Both buildings could have easily been seen from Leicester's building and were therefore on permanent display to visitors. Leciester's intent may have been to create a deliberately anachronistic view across the base court, echoing the older ideals of chivalry and romance alongside the more modern aspects of the redesign of the castle.|$|E

5|$|The 16th-century <b>gatehouse</b> is on {{the inland}} side of the Nether Bailey, and {{comprises}} twin D-plan towers flanking an arched entrance passage. Formerly the passage was defended by a portcullis and a double set of doors, with guard rooms either side. Over the entrance {{are a series of}} rooms which may have served as accommodation for the castle's keeper. Collapsed masonry surrounds the <b>gatehouse,</b> dating from its destruction after 1690.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Gatehouse</b> {{is reached}} across a wooden bridge, {{incorporating}} a drawbridge. Burges intended {{the bridge to}} copy those of medieval castles, which he believed were designed to be easily set on fire {{in the event of}} attack. The <b>Gatehouse</b> was fitted with a wooden defensive bretache and, above the entrance, Burges sited a portcullis and a glazed statue of the Madonna and Child sculpted by Ceccardo Fucigna.|$|E

5|$|The castle is now {{entered through}} the 13th-century {{southern}} <b>gatehouse,</b> which faces towards the former deer park. This entrance was once {{protected by a}} 14th-century fortified bridge, also called a barbican, but only one set of stone arches remain, showing two surviving arrow slits in arched recesses. The south <b>gatehouse</b> has two drum towers {{on either side of}} a gateway, protected by a portcullis, and would have had three floors, linked to a wall walk around the castle. It would originally have been faced with dressed stonework, which has since been removed. The north <b>gatehouse</b> on the opposite site of the bailey originally led into the town of Launceston. The first floor of the building was probably first used as the porter's room, then by the castle's constable, and finally later as a prison.|$|E
5|$|The {{different}} {{elements of the}} castle were also positioned for particular effect. Unusually, the huge Great <b>Gatehouse</b> faced south-east, away from the main road, hiding its extraordinary architectural features. This may have been because Thomas intended {{to establish a new}} settlement in front of it, but the <b>gatehouse</b> was also probably intended to be viewed from the harbour, where the most senior visitors were expected to arrive. The Lilburn Tower was positioned so as to be clearly - and provocatively - visible to Edward II's castle at Bamburgh, 9 miles (15km) away along the coast, and would have been elegantly framed by the entranceway to the Great <b>Gatehouse</b> for any visitors. It was also positioned on a set of natural basalt pillars, which - although inconvenient to build upon - would have enhanced its dramatic appearance and reflection in the meres.|$|E
5|$|The <b>gatehouse</b> and {{associated}} entry complex was constructed between 1854 and 1855 using convict labour. It {{was designed by}} Royal Engineer and Comptroller General Edmund Henderson, and constructed out of limestone. The <b>gatehouse</b> has two towers {{either side of a}} narrow gate, reminiscent of those found in 13th century English castles or walled cities. Iron that had been scavenged from shipwrecks was used to make the gate, while the clock {{at the top of the}} structure was imported from England. As the main entrance, the <b>gatehouse</b> has remained a significant feature and landmark; since the closure of the prison, it has housed a café and office areas. Restoration was carried out in 2005, preserving the original stone facade and removing non-original rendering.|$|E
