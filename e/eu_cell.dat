40|$|The {{transplantation}} {{of conventional}} human cell and tissue grafts, such as heart valve replacements and skin for severely burnt patients, has saved many lives {{over the last}} decades. The late eighties saw the emergence of tissue engineering with {{the focus on the}} development of biological substitutes that restore or improve tissue function. In the nineties, {{at the height of the}} tissue engineering hype, industry incited policymakers to create a European regulatory environment, which would facilitate the emergence of a strong single market for tissue engineered products and their starting materials (human cells and tissues). In this paper we analyze the elaboration process of this new European Union (EU) human cell and tissue product regulatory regime-i. e. the <b>EU</b> <b>Cell</b> and Tissue Directives (EUCTDs) and the Advanced Therapy Medicinal Product (ATMP) Regulation and evaluate its impact on Member States' health care systems. We demonstrate that the successful lobbying on key areas of regulatory and policy processes by industry, in congruence with Europe's risk aversion and urge to promote growth and jobs, led to excessively business oriented legislation. Expensive industry oriented requirements were introduced and contentious social and ethical issues were excluded. We found indications that this new EU safety and health legislation will adversely impact Member States' health care systems; since 30 December 2012 (the end of the ATMP transitional period) there is a clear threat to the sustainability of some lifesaving and established ATMPs that were provided by public health institutions and small and medium-sized enterprises under the frame of the EUCTDs. In the light of the current economic crisis it is not clear how social security systems will cope with the inflation of costs associated with this new regulatory regime and how priorities will be set with regard to reimbursement decisions. We argue that the ATMP Regulation should urgently be revised to focus on delivering affordable therapies to all who are in need of them and this without necessarily going to the market. The most rapid and elegant way to achieve this would be for the European Commission to publish an interpretative document on "placing on the market of ATMPs," which keeps tailor-made and niche ATMPs outside of the scope of the medicinal product regulation. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{describes}} a combined experimental, analytical and numerical modelling investigation into hydrogen jet fires in a passively ventilated enclosure. The work {{was funded by}} the <b>EU</b> Fuel <b>Cells</b> and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking project Hyindoor. It is relevant to situations where hydrogen is stored or used indoors. In such situations passive ventilation can be used to prevent the formation of a flammable atmosphere following a release of hydrogen. Whilst a significant amount of work has been reported on unignited releases in passively ventilated enclosures and on outdoor hydrogen jet fires, very {{little is known about the}} behaviour of hydrogen jet fires in passively ventilated enclosures. This paper considers the effects of passive ventilation openings on the behaviour of hydrogen jet fires. A series of hydrogen jet fire experiments were carried out using a 31  m 3 passively ventilated enclosure. The test programme included subsonic and chocked flow releases with varying hydrogen release rates and vent configurations. In most of the tests the hydrogen release rate was sufficiently low and the vent area sufficiently large to lead to a well-ventilated jet fire. In a limited number of tests the vent area was reduced, allowing under-ventilated conditions to be investigated. The behaviour of a jet fire in a passively ventilated enclosure depends on the hydrogen release rate, the vent area and the thermal properties of the enclosure. An analytical model was used to quantify the relative importance of the hydrogen release rate and vent area, whilst the influence of the thermal properties of the enclosure were investigated using a CFD model. Overall, the results indicate that passive ventilation openings that are sufficiently large to safely ventilate an unignited release will tend to be large enough to prevent a jet fire from becoming under-ventilated...|$|R

When samples are processed and high-security straws are used for cryopreservation, transmission of virus and cross-contamination in storage have not been reported. While initial screening of those about to embark on ART treatment is good practice, we can find no medical or scientific evidence to support re-screening prior to each treatment cycle for individuals undergoing partner donation in ART.

40|$|The quantum {{efficiency}} (QE) of solar {{cells in the}} UV and IR is lower than that in the VIS, due to absorption and transmission losses. These losses can be reduced through the down- and up-conversion of the incoming sun light. A larger fraction of the solar spectrum {{can be used for}} electricity generation if the converted sun light is spectrally fitted to the spectral response of the solar cell. In so doing, the efficiency of the solar cell increases. The maximal gain in the short circuit current density of a solar cell by the down-conversion of light within the spectral range of 300 and 400 nm to the visible spectral range amounts to 1. 36 mA/cm 2. Using the spectral transfer matrix formalism, the QE of amorphous thin film silicon solar cells with an ideal down-converter doped with the rare earth ions Tb and Eu is simulated. Down-conversion in the spectral range up to 400 nm results in a gain in QE. In this work, the down-conversion of the incoming sun light is investigated using the rare earth ions Tb and Eu within various glass matrices. These glass matrices include fluorozirconate(FZ) glasses, fluorochlorozirconate(FCZ) glasses, lithium and sodium borate glasses, and thin silica and alumina films. Tb ions can be excited in the UV between 300 and 380 nm and emit the converted light in the visible spectral range between 370 and 690 nm, which is well suited to the spectral response of amorphous thin film silicon solar <b>cells.</b> <b>Eu</b> ions can be excited in the UV of 300 and 390 nm and emits the converted light in the visible spectral range between 390 and 560 nm. The materials investigated for down-conversion are optimized with regard to their conversion efficiency and were compared to a commercial fluorescence glass doped with the rare earth ion Tb. Using photothermal deflection spectroscopy and classical transmission and reflection measurement, to determine the absorption of the down-converter, the internal conversion efficiency of the down-converter is determined. Decreasing the structure size, in which the rare earth ions are built, decreased the phonon energy of the matrix material, which leads to higher conversion efficiencies. The highest internal conversion efficiency is observed in FCZ glass, in this material the rare earth ion Eu is incorporated into barium chloride nanocrystals. The FZ and FCZ glasses are not resistant with regard to environmental influences. They corrode in contact with water. Sputtered silica and alumina films doped with the rare earth ion Tb, are optimized with regard to their photoluminescence intensity. The photoluminescence intensity of Tb doped thin films with different layer thickness on different substrates are corrected using the software program CODE with regard to interference effects and optical properties. The influence of Tb concentration, matrix material, and thermal annealing at different temperatures on the photoluminescence intensity is investigated. For up-conversion of the incoming sun light the rare earth ion Nd is investigated. Nd is implanted in quartz glass. The photoluminescence of Nd is investigated through down-conversion. The photoluminescence intensity is optimized through thermal annealing and their dependency on the Nd concentration is investigated. It was found, that concentration quenching sets in with a Nd concentration of 2 at. %. The emission of Nd at 900 nm, which is important for up-conversion, is passivated through water diffusion from air over time, which can be temporarily activated through thermal annealing. So, this system is not resistant with regard to environmental influences and must be further optimized for the application as up-converter. At the end of this work, the developed and optimized down-converters are applied in amorphous thin film silicon solar cells. The glasses investigated for down-conversion are put onto amorphous thin film silicon solar cells. The commercial fluorescence glass doped with the rare earth ion Tb, leads to an increase in the internal {{quantum efficiency}} over the spectral range up to 340 nm. The Eu doped FCZ glass leads to an increase in the internal quantum efficiency over the spectral range up to 335 nm. Thus providing proof-of-concept for the down-conversion of light using the rare earth ions Tb and Eu. Nevertheless, absorption losses in the visible spectral range lead to an overall loss in the short circuit current density. From the series of sputtered Tb doped thin silica and alumina films, the highest photoluminescence intensity is observed on a thin silica film doped with 2 at. % Tb, and annealed at 700 °C for 30 min in a nitrogen atmosphere. One such 3 µm thin Tb doped thin film is integrated into amorphous thin film silicon solar cells. This Tb doped thin film leads to very low absorption losses in the visible spectral range, however, the gain by down-conversion of the UV for this film was not evident...|$|R
