40|$|Discrepancy Reporting Management System (DRMS) is a {{computer}} program designed {{for use in the}} stations of NASA's Deep Space Network (DSN) to help establish the operational history of equipment items; acquire data on the quality of service provided to DSN customers; enable measurement of service performance; provide early insight into the need to improve processes, procedures, and interfaces; and enable the tracing of a data outage to a change in software or hardware. DRMS is a Web-based software system designed to include a distributed database and replication feature to achieve location-specific autonomy while maintaining a consistent high quality of data. DRMS incorporates commercial Web and database software. DRMS collects, processes, replicates, communicates, and manages information on spacecraft data discrepancies, equipment resets, and physical equipment status, and maintains an <b>internal</b> <b>station</b> log.

Njen toplotni odjem je priključen na obstoječi ogrevalni razvod interne toplotne postaje, ki je bila zgrajena leta 1975, in je še danes enake toplotne moči. Z leti pa se je povečevala potreba po toplotni moči, saj so se na toplotne razvode priključevala dodatna ogrevalna telesa, kot sta nova upravna stavba in rezervno ogrevanje strojnice bloka 6. V magistrski nalogi sem opisal obstoječe stanje interne toplotne postaje in informativno določil novo tehnološko opremo, ki bi jo bilo potrebno zamenjati pri rekonstrukciji interne toplotne postaje za nadaljnjo stabilno in varno obratovanje, ter določil nove režime regulacije obratovanja. Izdelal sem tudi izračun in izvedbo rezervnega ogrevanja strojnice bloka 6 in določil možne vire napajanja s paro za nadaljnjo obratovanje interne toplotne postaje. Določena tehnološka oprema je informativno izbrana kot primerzaradi poslovne narave so prikazani le osnovni podatki in stroškovne vrednosti izvedbe rekonstrukcije interne toplotne postaje.

40|$|Within NASA's High Performance Computing and Communication (HPCC) program, NASA Glenn Research Center is {{developing}} an {{environment for the}} analysis/design of propulsion systems for aircraft and space vehicles called the Numerical Propulsion System Simulation (NPSS). The NPSS focuses on the integration of multiple disciplines such as aerodynamics, structures, and heat transfer, along {{with the concept of}} numerical zooming between 0 - Dimensional to 1 -, 2 -, and 3 -dimensional component engine codes. The vision for NPSS is to create a "numerical test cell" enabling full engine simulations overnight on cost-effective computing platforms. Current "state-of-the-art" engine simulations are 0 -dimensional in that there is there is no axial, radial or circumferential resolution within a given component (e. g. a compressor or turbine has no <b>internal</b> <b>station</b> designations). In these 0 -dimensional cycle simulations the individual component performance characteristics typically come from a table look-up (map) with adjustments for off-design effects such as variable geometry, Reynolds effects, and clearances. Zooming {{one or more of the}} engine components to a higher order, physics-based analysis means a higher order code is executed and the results from this analysis are used to adjust the 0 -dimensional component performance characteristics within the system simulation. By drawing on the results from more predictive, physics based higher order analysis codes, "cycle" simulations are refined to closely model and predict the complex physical processes inherent to engines. As part of the overall development of the NPSS, NASA and industry began the process of defining and implementing an object class structure that enables Numerical Zooming between the NPSS Version I (0 -dimension) and higher order 1 -, 2 - and 3 -dimensional analysis codes. The NPSS Version I preserves the historical cycle engineering practices but also extends these classical practices into the area of numerical zooming for use within a companies' design system. What follows here is a description of successfully zooming I-dimensional (row-by-row) high pressure compressor results back to a NPSS engine 0 -dimension simulation and a discussion of the results illustrated using an advanced data visualization tool. This type of high fidelity system-level analysis, made possible by the zooming capability of the NPSS, will greatly improve the fidelity of the engine system simulation and enable the engine system to be "pre-validated" prior to commitment to engine hardware...|$|E
