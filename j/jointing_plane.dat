40|$|This report {{describes}} a three-dimensional model for jointed rock or other media {{with a single}} set of joints. The joint set consists of evenly spaced <b>joint</b> <b>planes.</b> The normal <b>joint</b> response is nonlinear elastic {{and is based on}} a rational polynomial. Joint shear stress is treated as being linear elastic in the shear stress versus slip displacement before attaining a critical stress level governed by a Mohr-Coulomb faction criterion. The three-dimensional model represents an extension of a two-dimensional, multi-joint model that has been in use for several years. Although most of the concepts in the two-dimensional model translate in a straightforward manner to three dimensions, the concept of slip on the <b>joint</b> <b>planes</b> becomes more complex in three dimensions. While slip in two dimensions can be treated as a scalar quantity, it must be treated as a vector in the <b>joint</b> <b>plane</b> in three dimensions. For the three-dimensional model proposed here, the slip direction is assumed to be the direction of maximum principal strain in the <b>joint</b> <b>plane.</b> Five test problems are presented to verify the correctness of the computational implementation of the model...|$|R

However, the drill holes after the normal stress across the joint. The resultant stress concentration decreases the joint aperture and can significantly affect the joint permeability. Different intersections of the hold axis relative to the <b>joint</b> <b>plane</b> were examined utilizing a plane-strain, elastic analysis. It was found that a tangential joint intersection minimized the normal stress change. Stress along the joint increased by 10 to 15 percent and the permeability-aperture product decreased to 65 to 70 percent of its original flow...|$|R

40|$|An {{analytical}} method is developed {{to provide a}} better understanding of bolt shearing across <b>joint</b> <b>planes</b> under lateral confinement. The study was undertaken in conjunction with a laboratory study of the double shearing of bolts in concrete. A review of various {{analytical method}}s is discussed, and the bending behaviour of the bolts is studied under both elastic and plastic conditions. Issues examined include; hinge point location, the effect of concrete strength on the bolt-bending behaviour; the influence of bolt axial loading and bolt diameter on the hinge point position with respect to sheared <b>joint</b> <b>planes.</b> It was found that the applied axial load on the bolt had a significant bearing on the location of the hinge points in different strength concrete, particularly at low strengths. The hinge point location is also influenced by the bolt diameter...|$|R
50|$|More recently, {{the debate}} has been reopened by Jeffrey Schaffer, who {{suggests}} {{that the role of}} glaciers and other erosion processes has been dramatically overstated. Schaffer states that Yosemite Valley above 5600 feet (1700 m), for example, has changed relatively little in the past 30 million years. Other than being slightly larger, if one could look back in time and see them, the major features would be recognizable to the modern eye. Schaffer believes that the numerous <b>joint</b> <b>planes</b> have had the greatest impact on the geomorphology of the Park's major features. This is in contradiction to the consensus view that huge highly abrasive glaciers acting on <b>joint</b> <b>planes</b> combined {{with a great deal of}} uplift over just the past couple million years was the primary shaping force of the features (such rapid uplift would have greatly accelerated all types of erosion).|$|R
40|$|The {{shearing}} behaviour of both {{steel rebar}} and hollow strand cable bolt across <b>joints</b> and shear <b>planes</b> in concrete blocks is examined experimentally. The steel rebars (bolts) {{were tested in}} 20, 40, 50 and 100 MPa concrete blocks, subjected to different pretension loads of 0, 5, 10, 20 50 and 80 kN respectively. Shear testing of the cable bolts, {{was carried out in}} a 50 MP concrete with the cables being tested under two initial axial loading of 50 and 100 kN respectively. It was found that the strength of the concrete has a significant influence on the shear load behaviour and shear deformation of the concrete {{in the vicinity of the}} sheared <b>joint</b> <b>planes.</b> Shearing load across the <b>joint</b> <b>planes</b> was less in 20 MPa concrete in comparison with higher strength, 40 and 100 MPa concrete. Analysis of the failure mode and loads achieved in cable bolt showed that the cable strands bent and the concrete crushed along the shear plane, the shear loading across the concrete and grouted cable then reached the tensile strength of the steel wires...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{the ability}} of the {{distinct}} lattice spring model (DLSM) for modeling stress wave propagation in rocks was fully investigated. The influence of particle size on simulation of different types of stress waves (e. g. one-dimensional (1 D) P-wave, 1 D S-wave and two-dimensional (2 D) cylindrical wave) was studied through comparing results predicted by the DLSM with different mesh ratios (lr) and those obtained from the corresponding analytical solutions. Suggested values of lr were obtained for modeling these stress waves accurately. Moreover, the weak material layer method and virtual <b>joint</b> <b>plane</b> method were used to model P-wave and S-wave propagating through a single discontinuity. The results were compared with the classical analytical solutions, indicating that the virtual <b>joint</b> <b>plane</b> method can give better results and is recommended. Finally, some remarks of the DLSM on modeling of stress wave propagation in rocks were provided...|$|R

40|$|The use of rock bolts as rock {{reinforcement}} {{is becoming}} more popular in Malaysia. However, its effectiveness depends {{on a number of}} factors particularly with regards to the technique of installing the bolt. Its reinforcement mechanism also restricts its application for certain modes of instability and types of rock. This paper highlights a laboratory investigation on the reinforcement mechanisms of rock bolts, specifically on bolt inclination, anchorage type and level of pre-tension. The investigation was conducted using a physical model of a rock bolt intersecting a <b>joint</b> <b>plane.</b> Results obtained show that a better reinforcement can be obtained if bolt is inclined at an angle to the <b>joint</b> <b>plane</b> so that it elongates upon joint displacement. Full-bonded bolt is more superior in terms of mobilising the anchorage capacity and consequently, this allows for immediate utilisation of the reinforcing element. Pre-tensioning of bolt induces clamping effect on joint surface consequently, helps to reduce joint dilatation and increases the inherent shear strength of the joint...|$|R
40|$|The load {{transfer}} capacity and failure mechanism of a fully grouted bolt installed across a joint in shear is investigated, both experimentally and numerically, in five types of bolt. The double-shearing testing of bolts were studied in concrete blocks of 20, 40 and 100 MPa strengths, subjected to different pretension loads of 0, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 80 KN, respectively. The parameters examined include: shear resistance, shear displacement, induced strains and stresses during the bolt-bending process, and its ultimate failure across the sheared <b>joint</b> <b>planes.</b> The conclusions {{drawn from the}} study were that {{the strength of the}} concrete, bolt profile configuration and bolt pretension load played a significant influence on the shear resistance, shear displacement and failure mechanism of the reinforced medium.

40|$|The {{development}} of large open surface fractures over mined-out coal longwall panels {{is the focus}} of this U. S. Bureau of Mines report. The research concentrates on defining the fractures characteristics and their controlling variables. The investigation was conducted at two mines in south-central West Virginia. All but one of the fractures are subparallel to the trend of the underlying longwall panel. One fracture is perpendicular to the trend of a longwall panel. Overall length of the fractures ranges from 60 to 900 ft. In cross section they are V-shaped, ranging from a couple of inches to 25 ft in width at the surface, but narrowing as they increase in depth. Fracture depth varies from a few inches to over 50 ft into bedrock. A vertical fracture or <b>joint</b> <b>plane</b> was observed in the bedrock at several open zones along the fractures. All of the fractures vary in elevation and do not parallel surface contours. The fractures are aligned with local joint trends, they correlate with longwall development, and they are situated in an increased tensional area over the mined out longwall panels. These observations indicate that the fractures are tensional openings along preexisting <b>joint</b> <b>planes</b> possibly triggered by longwall mining...|$|R
