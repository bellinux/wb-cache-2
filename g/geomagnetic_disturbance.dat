Only one half of the variance of the geomagnetic AL-index could be related to the solar wind. Therefore it is concluded that internal processes of the magnetosphere were responsible for additional geomagnetic activity.

Both these effects result in electron density enhancements at all heights at the equator, and the effect varies at other latitudes proportionately with the dip angle.|$|R

The unstable regions are found further downstream. Similarly, the 12 crossings through the tail show that the unstable regions are downstream of the stable regions.

The diurnal wave amplitude decreases with increasing threshold rigidity Rc, and the wave maximum occurs at 2 to 4 hr LT.

40|$|During small <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>disturbances,</b> ESRO 4 and OGO 6 gas {{analyzer}} measurements at high altitudes suggest that helium and atomic oxygen {{concentrations in the}} lower thermosphere decrease, whereas satellite drag measurements indicate that density increases. This discrepancy is explained by the corresponding temperature increases maximizing at high latitudes. ESRO 4 data suggest that at altitudes where atomic oxygen or helium predominates, the temperature increase compensates for the decrease in lower thermospheric concentrations. This yields a net density increase with <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>disturbances.</b> The Explorer 39 drag satellite measurements verify this conclusion. It is felt that the composition variations associated with minor disturbances indicate the upwelling of the polar atmosphere, circulation towards the equator, and subsidence in the equatorial region. ESRO measurements show that at low latitudes the increases in helium concentrations with <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>disturbances</b> are chiefly caused by the circulation from high latitudes and the subsidence at lower latitudes...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, coronal {{magnetic}} field structures are compared with coronal holes, interplanetary plasma and {{magnetic field}}s, and <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>disturbances.</b> The comparison {{is made for}} four selected periods, two in times of low solar activity and the remaining two in high solar activity. As a result, evidence is given that open magnetic structures are formed in the solar corona during both low and high solar activity periods, and that the open field regions are the sources of corotating high-speed solar wind streams. In particular, it is shown that recurrent series of <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>disturbances</b> are seen regardless of solar activity which are well associated with the central meridian passage of long-lived open field regions. In one case, geomagnetic activity of recurrent disturbances {{is found to be}} well correlated with the evolution of the corresponding open field region.

40|$|In September 1859 the Colaba {{observatory}} {{measured the}} most extreme <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>disturbance</b> ever recorded at low latitudes related to solar activity: the Carrington storm. This paper describes a <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>disturbance</b> case with a profile extraordinarily similar to the disturbance of the Carrington event at Colaba: the event on 29 October 2003 at Tihany magnetic observatory in Hungary. The analysis of the H-field at different locations during the "Carrington-like" event leads to a re-interpretation of the 1859 event. The major conclusions of the paper are the following: (a) the global Dst or SYM-H, as indices based on averaging, missed the largest <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>disturbance</b> in the 29 October 2003 event and might have missed the 1859 disturbance, since the large spike in the horizontal component (H) of terrestrial magnetic field depends strongly on magnetic local time (MLT); (b) {{the main cause of}} the large drop in H recorded at Colaba during the Carrington storm was not the ring current but field-aligned currents (FACs), and (c) the very local signatures of the H-spike imply that a Carrington-like event can occur more often than expected.

40|$|The Sun {{was very}} active {{in the early part}} of November 2004. During the period of 810 November 2004, intense <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>disturbances</b> with two superstorms were observed. In a {{companion}} paper (hereinafter referred to as paper 1), the effects observed in the F region during the intense <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>disturbances</b> {{in the early part of}} November 2004 in the Latin American sector were presented. In the present paper, we investigate the effects observed in the F region during the intense <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>disturbances</b> in the early part of November 2004 in the east Asian sector. We have used the ionospheric sounding observations at Ho Chi Minh City (Vietnam) and Okinawa, Yamagawa, Kokubunji, and Wakkanai (Japan) in the present investigations. Also, GPS observations in the east Asian sector (several longitude zones) have been used to study the effect in the F region during the intense <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>disturbances.</b> The ion density versus latitudinal variations obtained by the DMSP F 15 satellite orbiting at about 800 km altitude in the east Asian sector and the magnetic field data obtained at several stations in the Japanese meridian are also presented. Several important features from these observations in both the sectors during this extended period of intense <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>disturbances</b> are presented. The east Asian sector showed very pronounced effects during the second superstorm, which was preceded by two storm enhancements. It should be mentioned that around the beginning of the night on 10 November, ionospheric irregularities propagating from higher midlatitude region to low-latitude region were observed in the Japanese sector. The most intense geomagnetic field H component in that sector was observed on 10 November at L = 2. 8, indicating that the auroral oval and the heating got further to low latitudes and the ionospheric irregularities observed in the Japanese sector on this night are midlatitude ionospheric disturbances associated with the second superstorm. The absence of ionospheric irregularities in the Japanese sector during the 8 November superstorm suggests that the magnetosphere-ionosphere system was possibly preconditioned (primed) when the second interplanetary structure impacted the magnetosphere.

The two giant EQs during this period occurred after the two fastest geomagnetic variations, as revealed by the ratio of the daily Kp index variation over a day ΔKp/Δt (12 and 15, respectively).

40|$|Abstract. Solar Proton Events (SPE) are major, though infrequent, {{space weather}} {{phenomena}} {{that can produce}} hazardous effects in the near-Earth space environment. A detailed understanding of their effects depends upon knowledge of the dynamic rigidity cutoffs imposed by the changing total magnetic field. For {{the first time we}} investigate detailed comparisons between theoretical cutoff rigidities and ground-based measurements during the large <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>disturbance</b> of 4 - 10 November 2001. We make use of the imaging riometer (IRIS) at Halley, Antarctica, fortunately situated such that the rigidity cutoff sweeps {{back and forth across the}} instrument's field of view during the SPE period. The Kp-dependent geomagnetic 2 rigidity cutoff energies are determined from satellite observations combined with previously reported particle-tracing results. We find that the predicted absorption levels show good agreement with those experimentally observed for low and mid levels of <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>disturbance</b> (Kp< 5). However, during more disturbed geomagnetic conditions the cutoff modeling over-estimates the stretching of the geomagnetic field, under-estimating the rigidity cutoff energies, and hence leading to riometer absorption predictions that are too high. In very disturbed conditions (Kp≈ 7 - 9) the rigidity energy cutoffs indicated by the IRIS observations appear to be equivalent to those predicted for Kp≈ 6 by the particle-tracing approach. Examples of changing rigidity cutoff contours for increasing levels of <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>disturbance</b> are presented. 1...|$|E
