Without treatment, average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11years, depending on the HIV subtype.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{highlights}} {{the benefits of}} using knowledge ofthe rates of <b>fluid</b> mixing in the interpretation f reservoir <b>fluid</b> data. Comparison {{of the time it}} would take for a <b>fluid</b> difference to mix with the actual time available for mixing to occur allows two significant advances over a purely statistical analysis of reservoir <b>fluid</b> data: (1) differentiation of a step in <b>fluid</b> properties, indicative of a barrier to <b>fluid</b> communication, from a gradient indicative of incomplete mixing; and (2) quantitative estimation of the degree of compart-mentalization that can readily be adapted into models for prediction of reservoir production performance. We review the existing equations that estimate the mixing times for three main types of variation in <b>fluid</b> properties (<b>fluid</b> contacts, <b>fluid</b> density and <b>fluid</b> chemistry). In addition, a new relationship for <b>fluid</b> pressure mixing s presented. In each case the relationships were validated by comparison with numerical simulation. The different <b>fluid</b> mixing processes were compared by applying the equations to a range of simple <b>fluid</b> scenarios in one simple reservoir description.

5|$|There are {{a number}} of views on the {{potential}} uses of Type I and II <b>fluids.</b> The use of Type I fluid raises concern because its holdover time is shorter than the holdover time for Type II fluid under certain conditions. Both <b>fluids</b> are under scrutiny for their environmental impacts, and it is uncertain if Type II fluid diminishes the runway coefficient of friction since the fluid rolls off the airplane during the takeoff roll. Also, the use of either type fluid may result in a temporary degradation in the airplane's aerodynamic performance, a reduced stall margin, and an increase in drag.|$|E
5|$|Anisotropy {{of liquid}} {{crystals}} is a property not observed in other <b>fluids.</b> This anisotropy makes flows of liquid crystals behave more differentially {{than those of}} ordinary <b>fluids.</b> For example, injection of a flux of a liquid crystal between two close parallel plates (viscous fingering) causes orientation of the molecules to couple with the flow, with the resulting emergence of dendritic patterns. This anisotropy is also manifested in the interfacial energy (surface tension) between different liquid crystal phases. This anisotropy determines the equilibrium shape at the coexistence temperature, and {{is so strong that}} usually facets appear. When temperature is changed one of the phases grows, forming different morphologies depending on the temperature change. Since growth is controlled by heat diffusion, anisotropy in thermal conductivity favors growth in specific directions, which has also an effect on the final shape.|$|E

50|$|Decorative {{fountain}} systems employ <b>fluid</b> amplifiers {{to generate}} their decorative displays and effects. <b>Fluid</b> amplifiers {{rely on a}} <b>fluid</b> control stream to switch a <b>fluid</b> power stream. <b>Fluid</b> amplifiers are so named because a low-energy <b>fluid</b> control signal can control and switch a high-energy <b>fluid</b> power stream to produce an output signal of higher energy level than the <b>fluid</b> control signal. In <b>fluid</b> amplifiers, a <b>fluid</b> power stream, after leaving a nozzle, is switched selectively {{to one or more}} of a plurality of outlet passages. This may be done by supplying <b>fluid</b> control pressure continuously, or as a pulse, to one of the control ports at the exit end of the nozzle until the high-energy power stream is diverted. Alternatively, switching may be effected by closing the other control port so that the <b>fluid</b> that is flowing in through one control port from the atmosphere or some other source will create a sufficient <b>fluid</b> pressure imbalance adjacent the exit end of the nozzle to effect switching of the <b>fluid</b> power stream.|$|R

Amounts of 6 to 12liters over 24hours are recommended. The rate of fluid administration may be altered to achieve a high urine output (200–300ml/h in adults), unless there are other reasons why this might lead to complications, such as a history of heart failure.|$|E
