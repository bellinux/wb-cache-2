5|$|The Angel of the Lord {{stated that}} Manoah's wife was {{to abstain from}} all {{alcoholic}} beverages, and her promised child was not to shave or cut his hair. He {{was to be a}} Nazirite from birth. In ancient Israel, those wanting to be especially dedicated to God for a time could take a Nazirite vow which included abstaining from wine and spirits, not cutting hair or shaving, and other requirements. The wife believed the Angel of the Lord; her husband was not present, so he prayed and asked God to send the messenger once again to teach them <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the boy {{who was going to be}} born.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{contentious}} {{issues facing the}} First Congress during its inaugural session was the issue of <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> revenue for the federal government. There were both domestic and foreign Revolutionary War-related debts, {{as well as a}} trade imbalance with Great Britain that was crippling American industries and draining the nation of its currency. The first effort to begin addressing these issues resulted in the Tariff of 1789, authorizing the collection of duties on imported goods. Signed into law by the president on July 4, 1789, the act established the United States Customs Service and its ports of entry. One year later, the Revenue-Marine was established when Washington signed legislation authorizing construction of ten cutters to enforce federal tariff and trade laws and to prevent smuggling. Until Congress established the Navy Department in 1798, it served as the nation's only armed force afloat. Renamed a century later as the Revenue Cutter Service, it and the U.S. Life-Saving Service were merged in 1915 to form the United States Coast Guard.|$|E

25|$|During the Spanish Inquisition, Spanish women (as well as Native American and African American {{women in}} the Spanish colonies) were {{expected}} to behave {{in a manner that}} would promote the Spanish culture and uphold the standards of Catholicism. Women were typically limited to the following roles: nun, wife/housewife, and mother. Any other role was looked down upon as it defied the Crown and Spanish culture. In fact, Spanish women were expected to teach the Indigenous and African women <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> their children and take care of their family. Because familial endeavors were highly emphasized by the monarchs, Ferdinand II of Aragon and Isabella I of Castile, women were encouraged to have children, raise a family, and secure Spanish ideals and Catholic customs.|$|E

25|$|Fiscal {{contributions}} were {{of prime}} concern to policymakers in the 17th century, {{as they have}} remained ever since, for the wise country would not spend above its revenues. By Petty's time, England was engaged in war with Holland, {{and in the first}} three chapters of Treatise of Taxes and Contributions, Petty sought to establish principles of taxation and public expenditure, to which the monarch could adhere, when deciding <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> money for the war. Petty lists six kinds of public charge, namely defence, governance, the pastorage of men's souls, education, the maintenance of impotents of all sorts and infrastructure, or things of universal good. He then discusses general and particular causes of changes in these charges. He thinks that there is great scope for reduction of the first four public charges, and recommends increased spending on care for the elderly, sick, orphans, etc., as well as the government employment of supernumeraries.|$|E

500|$|Later in 1819, Nathaniel {{moved the}} family to Montville, a hamlet of Moravia. Appreciating his son's talents, Nathaniel Fillmore persuaded Judge Walter Wood, the Fillmores' {{landlord}} and the wealthiest person in the area, to allow Millard to be his law clerk for a trial period. Wood agreed to employ young Fillmore, and to supervise him as he read law. Fillmore taught school for three months to earn money to buy out his apprenticeship at the mill. Fillmore left Wood after 18 months; the judge paid him almost nothing, and the two quarreled when Fillmore earned a small sum by advising a farmer in a minor lawsuit. Refusing to pledge {{not to do it}} again, Fillmore left, abandoning his clerkship. Nathaniel Fillmore again moved the family, and Fillmore accompanied his father west to East Aurora, in Erie County, near Buffalo. [...] This move proved successful, and the farm Nathaniel Fillmore purchased there became prosperous. Nathaniel Fillmore would be the first father of a president to visit his son at the White House, and alluded to his family's onetime poverty when he told a questioner <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> a son to be president: [...] "Cradle him in a sap trough".|$|E
500|$|Seven {{years after}} the Santosky decision, the United States Supreme Court held in Price Waterhouse v. Hopkins that Santosky's higher burden of proof is an {{exception}} to the [...] "conventional rules of civil litigation [...] that parties to civil litigation need only prove their case by a preponderance of the evidence." [...] The Court later extended Santoskys finding of governmental interest in [...] "preserving and promoting the welfare of the child" [...] when it held in Reno v. Flores that children with no available guardians may be held in custody pending deportation hearings. In 2000, the right of parents to choose <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> their child, one of the main constitutional interests at issue in Santosky, was affirmed in Troxel v. Granville when the Court struck down a Washington law that allowed for third parties to petition for visitation rights over parental objections. In his dissent, Justice John Paul Stevens rebutted the assumption of Santosky that interests of the parent and the interests of the child do not diverge, arguing that [...] "the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment leaves room for States to consider the impact on a child of possibly arbitrary parental decisions that neither serve nor are motivated by {{the best interests of the}} child." ...|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft's [...] shows [...] "a keen {{and vital}} concern with education, {{especially}} {{the education of}} girls and women". One year before she published Original Stories, she wrote a conduct book (a popular 18th-century genre, akin to the modern self-help book) entitled Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787), which describes <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> the ideal middle-class woman. In 1789, she assembled The Female Speaker, a text meant to edify the minds of young women by exposing them to literature; she modelled it after William Enfield's anthology The Speaker, which was designed specifically for men. Just one year later, she translated [...] Christian Gotthilf Salzmann's Elements of Morality, a popular German pedagogical text. Wollstonecraft continued writing on educational issues in her most famous work, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), which is largely a defence of female education. She also devotes an entire chapter to outlining a national education plan—she envisioned a half-public, half-private, co-educational system. She also directly challenged Rousseau's [...] (1762), which claimed that women should not be taught to reason since they were formed for men's pleasure and that their abilities lay in observation rather than reason. When Wollstonecraft died in 1797, {{she was working on}} two more educational works: [...] "Management of Infants", a parenting manual; and [...] "Lessons", a reading primer inspired by Anna Laetitia Barbauld's Lessons for Children (1778–79).|$|E
500|$|Although Godwin admired Wollstonecraft's writings, he did {{not agree}} with her that women should receive the same {{education}} as men. Therefore, he occasionally read to Fanny and Mary from Sarah Trimmer's Fabulous Histories (1786) and Anna Laetitia Barbauld's Lessons for Children (1778–79), but, according to Todd, {{he did not}} take great pains with their educations and disregarded the books Wollstonecraft had written for Fanny. [...] William St Clair, in his biography of the Godwins and the Shelleys, argues that Godwin and Wollstonecraft spoke extensively about the education they wanted for their children and that Godwin's writings in The Enquirer reflect these discussions. He contends that after Wollstonecraft's death Godwin wrote to a former pupil to whom she had been close, now Lady Mountcashell, asking her advice on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>raise</b> and educate his daughters. In her biography of Mary Shelley, Miranda Seymour agrees with St Clair, arguing that [...] "everything we know about his daughter's [...] early years suggests that she was being taught in a way of which her mother would have approved", pointing out that she had a governess, a tutor, a French-speaking stepmother, and a father who wrote children's books whose drafts he read to his own first. It was the new Mrs Godwin who was primarily responsible for the education given to the girls, but she taught her own daughter more, including French. Fanny received no formal education after her stepfather's marriage. Yet, the adult Imlay is described by C. Kegan Paul, one of Godwin's earliest biographers, as [...] "well educated, sprightly, clever, a good letter-writer, and an excellent domestic manager". Fanny excelled in drawing and was taught music. Despite Godwin's atheism, all of the children were taken to an Anglican church.|$|E
