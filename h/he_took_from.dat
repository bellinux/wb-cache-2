5|$|In {{the view}} of his biographer Hugh Macdonald, Massenet's main {{influences}} were Gounod and Thomas, with Meyerbeer and Berlioz also important to his style. From beyond France he absorbed some traits from Verdi, and possibly Mascagni, and above all Wagner. Unlike some other French composers of the period, Massenet never fell fully under Wagner's spell, but <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>from</b> the earlier composer a richness of orchestration and a fluency in treatment of musical themes.|$|E

On April 18, Nathan was replaced at closer by Matt Capps after going 3 for 5 in save opportunities.

5|$|The {{change in}} {{partners}} leads the Simpson family to begin arguing and aggressively competing against one another. The tournament takes place, {{and in the}} stands, are leading tennis professionals Andre Agassi, Pete Sampras, Venus Williams, and Serena Williams. At the tournament, Homer ditches Lisa for Venus Williams. In response, Marge replaces Bart with Serena Williams as her partner. Ultimately, Serena and Venus replace Marge and Homer with Sampras and Agassi, respectively. This forces the family {{to go back to}} the bench and resume their normal places in the family. As they enjoy the exhibition of top-class tennis, they agree that it is better to watch things than to do things, and Homer offers to buy the family dinner with money <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>from</b> Sampras' wallet.|$|E
5|$|According to Hardorff, {{the theory}} is {{discounted}} by most academics. He suggests that Marquis may have made errors due {{to the use of}} sign language, which, he claims, cannot convey the nuances of language. In his book, Wooden Leg unambiguously relates a tale of mass suicide. He discusses possible causes of the suicides at length. It puzzled him because the idea of suicide to avoid capture was unknown to the Indians. Attributing the soldier's suicides to the effects of whisky was a common theory among the Indians, although Wooden Leg believed the prayers of medicine men to have been the cause. Wooden Leg's only taste of whisky up to the time of the battle had been a mouthful– which he immediately spat out– that <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>from</b> a captured bottle. In later life, Wooden Leg changed his mind and subscribed to the whisky theory after experiencing the effects of alcohol first-hand.|$|E
5|$|Athena reappears, {{demanding}} that Kratos return {{what she thinks}} <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>from</b> Pandora's Box. She refuses to believe the box was empty, explaining that when Zeus sealed the evils {{of the world in}} the box, she placed her power of hope in it, foreseeing that it would eventually be opened. Athena realizes that when Kratos opened the box to defeat Ares, the evils escaped and infected the gods while Kratos was imbued with hope, which enabled him to kill Ares. She tells Kratos to return her power, saying that she knows how to use it to rebuild the world. Distrusting Athena and tired of being used as a pawn, Kratos refuses; saying his vengeance has ended, he impales himself with the Blade of Olympus and releases hope for the world so that it can heal. An angry Athena pulls the sword from him, saying that he has disappointed her and leaves empty-handed. Near death, Kratos collapses as Athena leaves.|$|E

In the same book, Sultan Bahoo says, [...] "Faqir attains eternity by dissolving himself in oneness of Allah. He, when, eliminates his-self from other than Allah, his soul reaches to divinity."

25|$|Although Xiahou Dun was {{a soldier}} {{for most of his}} life, he was {{receptive}} to scholarly arts and even invited notable scholars to his camp to tutor him.

25|$|His {{style was}} {{conservative}} although it varies considerably over his career, {{and he was}} able to assimilate new influences into his own style without any discordant effect. <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>from,</b> in turn, Mytens, van Dyck, and William Dobson. His last Dutch portraits show a different style reflecting contemporary portraiture there. However he also influenced other artists – both lesser lights as well as more accomplished artists such as van Dyck. Following the Netherlandish tradition, he was particularly accurate and detailed in depiction of clothing. As a result, his portraits are especially useful to costume historians.|$|E
25|$|With his {{commitment}} to the New York Philharmonic and his many other activities, Bernstein had little time for composition during the 1960s. The two major works he produced at this time were his Kaddish Symphony dedicated to the recently assassinated President John F. Kennedy and the Chichester Psalms which he produced during a sabbatical year <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>from</b> the Philharmonic in 1965 to concentrate on composition. To make more time to composition was probably a major factor in his decision to step down as Music Director of the Philharmonic in 1969, and to never again accept such a position elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Ginsberg showed {{this poem}} to Kenneth Rexroth, who criticized it as too stilted and academic; Rexroth {{encouraged}} Ginsberg to free {{his voice and}} write from his heart. Ginsberg took this advice and attempted to write a poem with no restrictions. He was under the immense influence of William Carlos Williams and Jack Kerouac and attempted to speak with his own voice spontaneously. Ginsberg began the poem in the stepped triadic form <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>from</b> Williams but, {{in the middle of}} typing the poem, his style altered such that his own unique form (a long line based on breath organized by a fixed base) began to emerge.|$|E

25|$|By 1906, Abdulaziz {{had driven}} the Al Rashid out of Najd and the Ottomans {{recognized}} him as their client in Najd. His next major acquisition was Al-Hasa, which <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>from</b> the Ottomans in 1913, bringing him {{control of the}} Persian Gulf coast and what would become Saudi Arabia's vast oil reserves. He avoided involvement in the Arab Revolt, having acknowledged Ottoman suzerainty in 1914, and instead continued his struggle with the Al Rashid in northern Arabia. In 1920, the Ikhwan's attention turned to the south-west, when they seized Asir, the region between the Hejaz and Yemen. In the following year, Abdul-Aziz finally defeated the Al Rashid and annexed all northern Arabia.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the questions raised by {{the large amount of}} funding <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>from</b> the health care industry, Baucus declared a moratorium as of July 1, 2009 on taking more special interest money from health care political action committees. Baucus, however, refused to return as part of his moratorium any of the millions of dollars he has received from health care industry interests before July 1, 2009, or to rule out a resumption of taking the same or greater health care industry contributions in the future. His policy on not taking health care industry money reportedly still allowed him to accept money from lobbyists or corporate executives, who, according to The Washington Post, continued to make donations after July 1, 2009. A watchdog group found that in July 2009 Baucus accepted additional money from the health care industry in violation of his own self-defined moratorium terms, reportedly leading Baucus to return those monies.|$|E
25|$|William Egan Colby {{was born}} in Saint Paul, Minnesota, in 1920. His father, Elbridge Colby, who came from a New England family {{with a history of}} {{military}} and public service, was a professor of English, an author, and a military officer who served in the Army and in university positions in Tientsin, China; Georgia; Vermont; and Washington, D.C. Though a career officer, Elbridge Colby's professional pursuits focused less on strictly military activities and more on intellectual and scholarly contributions to military and literary subjects. Elbridge's father, Charles Colby, had been a professor of chemistry at Columbia University but had died prematurely, leaving his family largely without money. William's mother, Margaret Egan, was from an Irish family in St. Paul active in business and Democratic politics. With his Army father, William Colby had a peripatetic upbringing before attending public high school in Burlington, Vermont, and then Princeton University, graduating in 1940 and entering Columbia Law School the following year. Colby recounted that <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>from</b> his parents a desire to serve and a commitment to liberal politics, Catholicism, and independence, exemplified by his father's career-damaging protest in The Nation magazine regarding the lenient treatment of a white Georgian who had murdered a black U.S. soldier also based at Ft. Benning.|$|E

25|$|In 1806, in {{imitation}} of Ancient Rome, Napoléon ordered {{the construction of a}} series of monuments dedicated to the military glory of France. The first and largest was the Arc de Triomphe, built {{at the edge of the}} city at the Barrière d'Étoile, and not finished before July 1836. He ordered the building of the smaller Arc de Triomphe du Carrousel (1806–1808), copied from the arch of Arch of Septimius Severus and Constantine in Rome, next to the Tuileries Palace. It was crowned with a team of bronze horses <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>from</b> the façade of St Mark's Basilica in Venice. His soldiers celebrated his victories with grand parades around the Carrousel. He also commissioned the building of the Vendôme Column (1806–10), copied from the Trajan's Column in Rome, made of the iron of cannon captured from the Russians and Austrians in 1805. At the end of the Rue de la Concorde (given again its former name of Rue Royale on 27 April 1814), he took the foundations of an unfinished church, the Église de la Madeleine, which had been started in 1763, and transformed it into the Temple de la Gloire, a military shrine to display the statues of France’s most famous generals.|$|E
