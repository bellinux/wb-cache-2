40|$|Dysplasia can {{be defined}} as a preneoplastic lesion {{characterized}} by tissular architectural anomalies and cytological changes which remain confined to the epithelium. After a short description of the different histological and cytological criteria of esophageal squamous dysplasia, the authors review the old classifications in three grades: mild, moderate and severe and their evolution towards a simplified two tier classification in low and high grade. The evidence of an association between dysplasia and cancer and the role of dysplasia in esophageal carcinogenesis rely upon several types of studies: epidemiological (geographical and follow-up studies) as well as morphological (based on detailed investigations of surgical specimens). Although esophageal dysplasia is rare <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>countries,</b> <b>in</b> <b>populations</b> at risk, taking into account its excellent prognosis, a rigorous screening methodology must be used associating endoscopic vital staining with cytology and histology.

The contradictory results on the genetic gain in alfalfa breeding for yield in the world and <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>country</b> had as a consequence the yield analysis from different experiments, in different locations, through different years neglecting the interaction germplasm x year (age of alfalfa fields), and germplasm by environment (ecological conditions related to site or conditions in the year). In order to assess the progress in breeding alfalfa for yield <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>country,</b> new experimental <b>populations</b> were compared with old and new alfalfa cultivars developed in the Institute of Field and Vegetable Crops Novi Sad, Serbia. Yield differences between cultivars and experimental populations of alfalfa were not significant. New alfalfa breeding programs should focus on yield per se, with the use of new knowledge on the genetic control of yield and with adaptation of existing or creating new breeding procedure...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} study government’s {{regulation}} of fisheries (or other natural resources) {{in the presence}} of the following two characteristics: 1) The fishery is shared between different countries, so there is at least one other country also regulating the fishery. 2) There is some level of political risk regarding future decisions in both/all countries, which is recognized both by fishermen and governments. The main question we study is how this political risk should affect the government’s policy. We focus on two aspects of government policy; enforcement levels and political uncertainty <b>in</b> own <b>country.</b> <b>Our</b> main result is that uncertainty about enforcement levels in the other country affects the optimal behaviour for the government <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>country.</b> If the optimal enforcement level <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>country</b> is a concave function of the enforcement level in the other country, uncertainty about the policy in the other country should reduce the optimal enforcement level <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>country,</b> which also implies that it is optimal for <b>our</b> <b>country</b> to remove more uncertainty about our policy than it would otherwise be. Conversely, if the optimal enforcement level <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>country</b> is a convex function of the enforcement level in the other country, uncertainty about enforcement in the other country should increase the enforcement level <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>country,</b> and it would be optimal to maintain a higher level of uncertainty about our own policy than otherwise...|$|R
