30|$|We have {{observed}} that many paths common among PDF files exhibit structural similarities to other paths. In fact, {{we were able to}} identify groups of paths similar to each other but not identical. Paths in these groups exhibited a similarity in one of two ways. Paths in some groups were identical except for exactly one customizable path component, while paths in other groups shared a common repetitive subpath. Importantly, however, all paths in a group of similar paths refer to objects with the same purpose, i.e., the same semantic meaning, in PDF. For example, the paths /Pages/Kids/Resources and /Pages/Kids/Kids/Resources have a common repetitive subpath, /Kids, but both refer to PDF dictionaries that have the same purpose—to provide a name for resources required to render a page of a PDF file. Semantically, it is irrelevant which path the structure extraction algorithm took before it visited a page’s resource dictionary—all resource dictionaries have the same semantic meaning. Likewise, the paths /Pages/Kids/Resources/Font/F 1 and /Pages/Kids/Resources/Font/F 42 only differ in the last path segment, which the PDF Standard mandates to be user-defined, but both refer to Font dictionaries describing fonts for use in the PDF file. Again, regardless of the concrete name a specific PDF writer gives to a <b>font</b> <b>dictionary,</b> all font dictionaries are semantically equivalent.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{his arrival}} in the Qing Empire, Morrison learned that the Chinese were {{prohibited}} from teaching their language to foreigners, forcing him to study Chinese secretly and hide his books from sight. Morrison eventually found two tutors, the scholar [...] "Ko Seen-sang" [...] and Abel Yun, who had learned Latin from Catholic missionaries. Together, they began to translate the scriptures and compile the dictionary. In 1809, the East India Company employed Morrison as their translator, which legitimized his presence in Guangzhou's Thirteen Factories and provided sufficient income to continue working on the dictionary project and Bible translation. He translated and printed the Acts of the Apostles in 1810 and completed his Chinese Grammar in 1811. The situation worsened in 1812 when the Jiaqing Emperor issued an edict adding Christianity {{to the list of}} banned witchcrafts and superstitions, making the printing of Chinese-language books on the subject a capital crime [...] The LMS sent the missionary William Milne to assist Morrison in translating and printing the scriptures. In 1814, the East India Company sent the printing engineer Peter Perring Thoms. Together with Morrison's Chinese assistants such as Cai Gao and Liang Fa, he created the Chinese character <b>font</b> for the <b>dictionary.</b> Morrison worked on producing A Dictionary of the Chinese Language for more than 15 years with [...] "extraordinary perseverance, industry, and ingenuity" [...]|$|R
