In July 2015 they agreed to launch six sustainable bioplastic office products (Clip-Mate™, Memo-Mate™, File-Mate™, Pencil-Mate™, Self-Stacker and <b>Desk</b> <b>Tray)</b> in a commercial agreement with TOPS Products Canada.|$|E
50|$|In 1896, Zonia Baber {{designed}} {{a new school}} desk with features specifically for the teaching of geography and other sciences. Unlike a regular school <b>desk,</b> Zonia's featured <b>trays</b> and compartments meant to store learning supplies. Having these trays and compartments meant that students using her desk would always have their learning supplies at hand.|$|R
50|$|By 1927, Shearer {{had made}} a total of 13 silent films for MGM. Each had been {{produced}} for under $200,000 and had, without fail, been a substantial box-office hit, often making a $200,000+ profit for the studio. She was rewarded for this consistent success by being cast in Ernst Lubitsch's The Student Prince in Old Heidelberg, her first prestige production, with a budget over $1,000,000. While she was finishing The Student Prince, Shearer received a call summoning her to Thalberg's office. She entered to find Thalberg sitting at his <b>desk</b> before a <b>tray</b> of diamond engagement rings. He granted her the option to choose her own ring; she picked out the biggest. After weeks of rumors, provoked by wearing the ring, it was announced in August 1927 {{that they were to}} wed. On September 29, 1927, they were married in the Hollywood wedding of the year. Shearer had two children with Thalberg, Irving Thalberg, Jr. (1930-1987) and Katherine (1935-2006). Before they were married, Shearer converted to Judaism so she could marry Thalberg.|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the best}} {{representation}} of Christopher Center's integration of traditional library services with current {{technology is the}} Automated Storage and Retrieval System (ASRS). This combination of robotics and computer system {{has the capacity to}} store 300,000 files. Two stories high, the system features bins stacked along two aisles. Materials that are used infrequently by students or faculty are maintained in this location.When one of the 60,000 items is requested, the robotic system locates and retrieves the publication in about 15 seconds. Using a bar code logged into it, the management computer system runs the robot and simultaneously registers the volume's current location in the one of its 1,872 bins. Designed like a combination car-jack and fork lift, the computer-controlled cranes move along the aisles and up or down the stacks of bins to retrieve the requested material and place it on a <b>tray</b> <b>desk</b> in the main circulation area. Provided by a gift from alumnus Herbert F. Stride, this automated storage and retrieval system {{is one of the first}} five installed for use in libraries in the nation.|$|R
