40|$|During {{the recent}} {{financial}} crisis, ABX. HE index credit default swaps (CDS) on baskets of mortgage-backed securities were a benchmark widely used by financial institutions to mark their subprime mortgage portfolios to market. However, {{we find that}} prices for the AAA ABX. HE <b>index</b> <b>CDS</b> during the crisis were inconsistent with any reasonable assumption for mortgage default rates, and that these price changes are only weakly correlated with observed changes in the credit performance of the underlying loans in the index, casting serious doubt on the suitability of these CDS as valuation benchmarks. We also find that the AAA ABX. HE <b>index</b> <b>CDS</b> price changes are related to short-sale activity for publicly traded investment banks with significant mortgage market exposure. This suggests that capital constraints, limiting the supply of mortgage-bond insurance, may be playing a role here similar to that identified by Froot (2001) {{in the market for}} catastrophe insurance.

40|$|We value {{synthetic}} CDO tranche spreads, <b>index</b> <b>CDS</b> spreads, k th-to-default swap spreads and tranchelets in an intensity-based {{credit risk}} model with default contagion. The default dependence is modelled by letting individual intensities jump when other defaults occur. The model is reinterpreted as a Markov jump process. This {{allows us to}} use a matrix-analytic approach to derive computationally tractable closed-form expressions for the credit derivatives {{that we want to}} study. Special attention is given to homogenous portfolios. For a fixed maturity of five years, such a portfolio is calibrated against CDO tranche spreads, <b>index</b> <b>CDS</b> spread and the average CDS spread, all taken from the iTraxx Europe series. After the calibration, which renders perfect fits, we compute spreads for tranchelets and k th-to-default swap spreads for different subportfolios of the main portfolio. Studies of the implied tranche-losses and the implied loss distribution in the calibrated portfolios are also performed. We implement two different numerical methods for determining the distribution of the Markov-process. These are applied in separate calibrations in order to verify that the matrix-analytic method is independent of the numerical approach used to find the law of the process. Monte Carlo simulations are also performed to check the correctness of the numerical implementations...|$|E

40|$|It {{appears from}} discussions held with {{practitioners}} on forums and conferences that hedging products with CDSs is often {{considered to be}} an easy task. For instance, a bond-CDS position is frequently seen to be a perfect hedge as is the <b>index</b> <b>CDS</b> and its corresponding single-name counterparts. On the other hand, theoreticians claim that a perfect hedge is impossible to achieve with credit derivatives: currently it seems there is no model from which a perfect hedge of credit derivatives can be set up. So, who's right? This paper aims to show that, surprisingly, both are right, in some sense. The misunderstanding comes from a misspecification of the “hedge” term, together with a confusion between hedging and arbitraging. We focus on Credit Default Swaps and explain why, among other things, the “Bond-CDS on the Bond” position does not result in a perfect hedge (except in a very specific case, which is not market standard). By contrast, partial hedge (that is, hedging some parts of the risk) can be obtained and, of course, arbitrage opportunities could be found. We then explain, adopting a philosophical point of view, why it is so problematic to set up a credit portfolio being perfectly hedged (even in a first-order approximation sense). It appears that the nature of the derivative's underlying prevents us reaching this with the currently available financial instruments...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consist of}} four papers on dynamic {{dependence}} modelling in portfolio credit risk. The {{emphasis is on}} valuation of portfolio credit derivatives. The underlying model in all papers is the same, but is split in two different submodels, one for inhomogeneous portfolios, and one for homogeneous ones. The latter framework allows us to work with much bigger portfolios than the former. In both models the default dependence is introduced by letting individual default intensities jump when other defaults occur, but be constant between defaults. The models are translated into Markov jump processes which represents the default status in the credit portfolio. This {{makes it possible to}} use matrix-analytic methods to find convenient closed-form expressions for many quantities needed in dynamic credit portfolio management and valuation of portfolio credit derivatives. Paper one presents formulas for single-name credit default swap spreads and kth- to-default swap spreads in an inhomogeneous model. In a numerical study based on a synthetic portfolio of 15 telecom bonds we study, e. g., how kth-to-default swap spreads depend on the amount of default interaction and on other factors. Paper two derives computational tractable formulas for synthetic CDO tranche spreads and <b>index</b> <b>CDS</b> spreads. Special attention is given to homogenous portfolios. Such portfolios are calibrated against market spreads for CDO tranches, index CDSs, the average CDS and FtD baskets, all taken from the iTraxx Europe series. After the calibration, which leads to perfect fits, we compute spreads for tranchelets and kth-to-default swap spreads for different subportfolios of the main portfolio. We also investigate implied tranche-losses and the implied loss distribution in the calibrated portfolios. Paper three is devoted to derive and study, in an inhomogeneous model, convenient formulas for multivariate default and survival distributions, conditional multivariate distributions, marginal default distributions, multivariate default densities, default correlations, and expected default times. We calibrate the model for two different portfolios (with 10 obligors), one in the European auto sector, the other in the European financial sector, against their market CDS spreads and the corresponding CDS-correlations. In paper four we perform the same type of studies as in Paper 3, but for a large homogenous portfolio. We use the same market data as in Paper 2. Many of the results differ substantially from the corresponding ones in the inhomogeneous portfolio in Paper 3. Furthermore, these numerical studies indicates that the market CDO tranche spreads implies extreme default clustering in upper tranches...|$|E

40|$|Lots of similarity-based {{algorithms}} {{have been}} designed {{to deal with the problem}} of link prediction in the past decade. In order to improve prediction accuracy, a novel cosine similarity <b>index</b> <b>CD</b> based on distance between nodes and cosine value between vectors is proposed in this paper. Firstly, node coordinate matrix can be obtained by node distances which are different from distance matrix and row vectors of the matrix are regarded as coordinates of nodes. Then, cosine value between node coordinates is used as their similarity index. A local community density index LD is also proposed. Then, a series of CD-based indices include CD-LD-k, CD*LD-k, CD-k and CDI are presented and applied in ten real networks. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of CD-based indices. The effects of network clustering coefficient and assortative coefficient on prediction accuracy of indices are analyzed. CD-LD-k and CD*LD-k can improve prediction accuracy without considering the assortative coefficient of network is negative or positive. According to analysis of relative precision of each method on each network, CD-LD-k and CD*LD-k indices have excellent average performance and robustness. <b>CD</b> and CD-k <b>indices</b> perform better on positive assortative networks than on negative assortative networks.

The standard treatment was given in control group, alprostadil 10 μg 2 /d was given in alprostadil group on base of standard treatment. Monitoring indexes were recorded in 1, 3 and 6 days after enrollment. General condition of patients, APACHE Ⅱ score, ventilator conditions (PO 2, PCO 2, RR, PEEP, FiO 2, oxygenation index, airway resistance, lung compliance), mechanical ventilation time, ICU stay time, hospital follow-up, 28 -day follow-up, immune <b>index</b> (<b>CD</b> 4 +/CD 8 +), inflammatory markers (CRP, PCT, IL- 6) were monitored.

MethodsThe fresh pig bone and deproteinized bone were transplanted respectively to establish BABL/C thigh muscle pouches model of male mice and take the samples for detection at 1, 2, 4, 6 weeks after operation. Lymphocyte stimulation index, subset analysis, serum specific antibody IgG, cytokine detection and topographic histologic reaction after implantation were investigated. ResultsAfter the transplantation of deproteinized bone, lymphocyte stimulation <b>index,</b> <b>CD</b> 4 + and CD 8 + T-lymphocyte subsets, serum specific antibody IgG and cytokines in deproteinized bone group were significantly lower than those in fresh pig bone group {{at each time point}} (P< 0. 05). The histological examination found that in fresh bone group at each time point, a large quantity of inflammatory cells infiltrated in the surrounding of bone graft, and they were mainly lymphocytes, including macrophages and monocytes. In deproteinized bone group, there were few inflammatory cells infiltration around bone graft one week after operation. The lymphocytes were decreased as time went by. At 6 weeks, fibroblasts and fibrous tissue grew into the graft, and osteoclasts and osteoprogenitor cells appeared on the verge. ConclusionsThe established heterogeneous deproteinized bone has low immunogenicity and is a potentially ideal scaffold material for bone tissue engineering...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAIMS: Occupational {{exposure}} to organophosphate pesticides {{is becoming a}} common and increasingly alarming world-wide phenomenon. The present study is designed to investigate the preventive effect of N-acetylcysteine on malathion-induced hepatic injury and inflammation in rats. MAIN METHODS: Adult male Wistar rats of body weight 200 - 230 g {{were used for the}} study. Malathion (200 mg/kg b. w. /day) was administered to rats by oral intubation and N-acetylcysteine (2 g/l) in drinking water for 28 days. Rats were sacrificed on the 28 th day, 2 h after the last administration. Markers of liver injury (aspartate transaminase, alanine transaminase, alkaline phosphatase and lactate desyhdogenase), inflammation (leukocyte counts, myeloperoxidase, immunophenotyping of CD 4 (+) and CD 8 (+), interleukin- 1 β, interleukin- 6 and interferon-γ expression) and oxidative stress (lipid peroxidation, reduced glutathione and antioxidant status) were assessed. KEY FINDINGS: Malathion induced an increase in activities of hepatocellular enzymes in plasma, lipid peroxidation <b>index,</b> <b>CD</b> 3 (+) /CD 4 (+) and CD 3 (+) /CD 4 (+) percent and pro-inflammatory cytokines, when decreased antioxidant status in liver was noted. When malathion-treated rats were compared to NAC supplemented rats, leukocytosis, T cell count and IL- 1 β, IL- 6, INF-γ expression were reduced. Furthermore, NAC restored liver enzyme activities and oxidative stress markers. SIGNIFICANCE: Malathion induces hepatotoxicity, oxidative stress and liver inflammation. N-acetylcysteine showed therapeutic effects against malathion toxicity...|$|R
40|$|Tuberculosis {{and human}} Immuno-deficiency virus co-epidemics remain {{a major public}} health {{challenge}} particularly in resource limited settings. This study determined the prevalence of HIV co-infection among TB patients and the risk factors among patients attending Holly memorial Hospital Ochadamu, Ofu L. G. A., Kogi State, Nigeria. Two hundred (200) patients participated in the research, out of which one hundred and seventy three (173) were already confirmed to be HIV positive. Sputum samples were collected by experts into sample bottles aseptically for Acid fast Bacilli test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis; while blood samples were collected by trained nurses from the same candidates by venepuncture into anticoagulated bottles for HIV screening to re- confirm their status. Questionnaires were also administered to obtain some important demographic data. Sputum smear microscopy was carried out to test for Acid Fast Bacilli. Rapid haemagglutination assay was carried out to re-confirm the HIV status of the patients. Results showed that Twenty seven (27) patients signifying 13. 5 % were TB/HIV co-infected. There was significant (p< 0. 05) relationship between TB and HIV status of the patients and clinical symptoms (dry cough, cough with sputum, weight loss and fever). There is need to study Immuno-haematological <b>indices</b> (<b>CD</b> 4 count, Full Blood Count and ESR) routinely to monitor TB and HIV patients on regular basis {{in order to reduce}} morbidity and mortality associated with the diseases...|$|R
