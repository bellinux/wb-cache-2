40|$|Individual {{analysis}} of functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans requires user-adjustment {{of the statistical}} threshold {{in order to maximize}} true functional activity and eliminate false positives. In this study, we propose a novel technique that uses radiomic texture analysis (TA) features associated with heterogeneity to predict areas of true functional activity. Scans of 15 right-handed healthy volunteers were analyzed using SPM 8. The resulting functional maps were thresholded to optimize visualization of language areas, resulting in 116 regions of interests (ROIs). A board-certified neuroradiologist classified different ROIs into Expected (E) and Non-Expected (NE) based on their anatomical locations. TA was performed using the mean Echo-Planner Imaging (EPI) volume, and 20 rotation-invariant texture features were obtained for each ROI. Using forward stepwise logistic regression, we built a predictive model that discriminated between E and NE areas of functional activity, with a cross-validation AUC and success rate of 79. 84 % and 80. 19 % respectively (specificity/sensitivity of 78. 34 %/ 82. 61 %).

The test materials were five different types of plastic kitchen utensils obtained from a global supplier. Homogeneity studies on width, depth, length and thickness of the samples were carried out by the EURL-FCM. They indicated sufficient sample homogeneity. Samples were dispatched to 67 participants (30 NRLs + 37 national official control laboratories from Belgium, Germany, Italy, Spain and the United Kingdom), 63 of them submitted results for the surface area and 53 for the envelope volume.
