5|$|Love's Last Shift {{is today}} read mainly {{to gain a}} {{perspective}} on Vanbrugh's sequel The Relapse, which has by contrast remained a stage favourite. Modern scholars often <b>endorse</b> <b>the</b> criticism that was levelled at Love's Last Shift from the first, namely {{that it is a}} blatantly commercial combination of sex scenes and drawn-out sentimental reconciliations. Cibber's follow-up comedy Woman's Wit (1697) was produced under hasty and unpropitious circumstances and had no discernible theme; Cibber, not usually shy about any of his plays, even elided its name in the Apology. It was followed by the equally unsuccessful tragedy Xerxes (1699). Cibber reused parts of Woman's Wit for The School Boy (1702).|$|E

The mediation plan, however, was soon dropped. Britain and France continued to consider, and put forward, plans to prevent foreign volunteers, outside of the Committee.|$|E
