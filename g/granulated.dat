5|$|Brown sugars are <b>granulated</b> sugars, either {{containing}} residual molasses, or {{with the}} grains deliberately coated with molasses to produce a light- or dark-colored sugar. They are used in baked goods, confectionery, and toffees.|$|E
5|$|Liquid sugars {{are strong}} syrups {{consisting}} of 67% <b>granulated</b> sugar dissolved in water. They {{are used in}} the food processing {{of a wide range of}} products including beverages, hard candy, ice cream, and jams.|$|E
5|$|Onions are {{available}} in fresh, frozen, canned, caramelised, pickled, and chopped forms. The dehydrated product is available as kibbled, sliced, ring, minced, chopped, <b>granulated,</b> and powder forms.|$|E
5|$|Sugar cubes (sometimes called sugar lumps) {{are white}} or brown <b>granulated</b> sugars lightly steamed and pressed {{together}} in block shape. They {{are used to}} sweeten drinks.|$|E
5|$|<b>Granulated</b> sugars {{are used}} at the table, to {{sprinkle}} on foods and to sweeten hot drinks (coffee and tea), and in home baking to add sweetness and texture to baked products (cookies and cakes) and desserts (pudding and ice cream). They are also used as a preservative to prevent micro-organisms from growing and perishable food from spoiling, as in candied fruits, jams, and marmalades.|$|E
5|$|In {{the midst}} of the fight for repeal of Free Silver coinage in 1893, Cleveland sought the advice of the White House doctor, Dr. O'Reilly, about soreness on the roof of his mouth and a crater-like edge ulcer with a <b>granulated</b> surface {{on the left side of}} Cleveland's hard palate. Samples of the tumor were sent {{anonymously}} to the Army Medical Museum. The diagnosis was not a malignant cancer, but instead an epithelioma.|$|E
5|$|It may be {{prepared}} with toppings such as sugar, chocolate or maple glazes, dusted with <b>granulated</b> sugar or cinnamon-sugar, or served plain without any topping. The {{shape of the}} doughnut can lend to the retention of a greater amount of glaze or other toppings compared to other doughnut styles. The old-fashioned doughnut may have a similar texture {{to that of a}} buttermilk doughnut, may be crisp in texture, and typically has cracks and pores on its surface.|$|E
5|$|The {{generic name}} is a {{combination}} of the Latin prefix semi, meaning half, and noun cassis, meaning helmet. The specific name of this taxon, granulata, is derived from the Latin noun grana meaning grain. Here it is used in the diminutive form, meaning <b>granulated,</b> or covered in granules, i.e. small grains or pellets, referring to the shell sculpture.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{and white}} <b>granulated</b> sugar are 97% to nearly 100% carbohydrates, respectively, {{with less than}} 2% water, and no dietary fiber, protein or fat (table). Brown sugar {{contains}} a moderate amount of iron (15% of the Reference Daily Intake in a 100 gram amount, see table), but a typical serving of 4 grams (one teaspoon), would provide 15 calories and a negligible amount of iron or any other nutrient. Because brown sugar contains 5–10% molasses reintroduced during processing, its value to some consumers is a richer flavor than white sugar.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the late}} nineteenth century, sugar was {{purchased}} in loaves, {{which had to be}} cut using implements called sugar nips. In later years, <b>granulated</b> sugar was more usually sold in bags. Sugar cubes were produced in the nineteenth century. The first inventor of a process to make sugar in cube form was the Moravian Jakub Kryštof Rad, director of a sugar company in Dačice. He began sugar cube production after being granted a five-year patent for the process on January 23, 1843. Henry Tate of Tate & Lyle was another early manufacturer of sugar cubes at his refineries in Liverpool and London. Tate purchased a patent for sugar cube manufacture from German Eugen Langen, who in 1872 had invented a different method of processing of sugar cubes.|$|E
25|$|Sucralose is {{a highly}} {{heat-stable}} noncaloric sweetener, allowing it {{to be used in}} many recipes with little or no sugar. It is available in a <b>granulated</b> form that allows for same-volume substitution with sugar. This mix of <b>granulated</b> sucralose includes fillers, all of which rapidly dissolve in liquids. While the <b>granulated</b> sucralose provides apparent volume-for-volume sweetness, the texture in baked products may be noticeably different. Sucralose is not hygroscopic, which can lead to baked goods that are noticeably drier and manifest a less dense texture than those made with sucrose. Unlike sucrose, which melts when baked at high temperatures, sucralose maintains its granular structure when subjected to dry, high heat (e.g., in a 350°F or 180°C oven). Furthermore, in its pure state, sucralose begins to decompose at 119°C or 246°F. Thus, in some baking recipes, such as crème brûlée, which require sugar sprinkled on top to partially or fully melt and crystallize, substituting sucralose will not result in the same surface texture, crispness, or crystalline structure.|$|E
25|$|Ground <b>granulated</b> {{blast furnace}} slag (GGBFS or GGBS): A {{by-product}} of steel production is used to partially replace Portland cement (by up to 80% by mass). It has latent hydraulic properties.|$|E
25|$|To produce <b>granulated</b> sugar, {{in which}} {{individual}} grains do not clump, sugar must be dried, first by heating in a rotary dryer, {{and then by}} blowing cool air through it for several days.|$|E
25|$|Slag-like <b>granulated</b> corium, slag-like {{irregular}} gray-magenta to dark-brown glassy granules with crust. Formed by prolonged contact {{of brown}} ceramics with water, located in large heaps in both {{levels of the}} Pressure Suppression Pool.|$|E
25|$|The stadium {{was opened}} in 1926 with a seating {{capacity}} of roughly 35,000--the {{lower level of}} the final configuration's sideline seats. Tulane Stadium was built on Tulane University's campus (before 1871, Tulane's campus was Paul Foucher's Plantation, where Foucher's father-in-law, Étienne de Boré, had first <b>granulated</b> sugar from cane syrup).|$|E
25|$|Supersulfated cements contain about 80% ground <b>granulated</b> {{blast furnace}} slag, 15% gypsum or {{anhydrite}} {{and a little}} Portland clinker or lime as an activator. They produce strength by formation of ettringite, with strength growth similar to a slow Portland cement. They exhibit good resistance to aggressive agents, including sulfate.|$|E
25|$|Honey {{gets its}} {{sweetness}} from the monosaccharides fructose and glucose, and has {{about the same}} relative sweetness as <b>granulated</b> sugar. It has attractive chemical properties for baking and a distinctive flavor when used as a sweetener. Most microorganisms do not grow in honey, so sealed honey does not spoil, even after thousands of years.|$|E
25|$|Passover cake recipes {{call for}} potato starch or Passover cake flour made from finely <b>granulated</b> matzo instead of regular flour, {{and a large}} amount of eggs to achieve fluffiness. Cookie recipes use matzo farfel (broken bits of matzo) or ground nuts as the base. For {{families}} with Eastern European backgrounds, borsht, a soup made with beets, is a Passover tradition.|$|E
25|$|The 238U {{remaining}} after enrichment {{is known}} as depleted uranium (DU), and is considerably less radioactive than even natural uranium, though still very dense and extremely hazardous in <b>granulated</b> form – such granules are a natural by-product of the shearing action that makes it useful for armor-penetrating weapons and radiation shielding. At present, 95 percent of the world's stocks of depleted uranium remain in secure storage.|$|E
25|$|Portland {{blast-furnace}} slag cement, or Blast furnace cement (ASTM C595 and EN 197-1 nomenclature respectively), contains up to 95% ground <b>granulated</b> {{blast furnace}} slag, {{with the rest}} Portland clinker and a little gypsum. All compositions produce high ultimate strength, but as slag content is increased, early strength is reduced, while sulfate resistance increases and heat evolution diminishes. Used as an economic alternative to Portland sulfate-resisting and low-heat cements.|$|E
25|$|A sugar packet is a {{delivery}} method for one 'serving' of sugar. Sugar packets are commonly supplied in restaurants and coffee bars in preference to sugar bowls or sugar dispensers {{for reasons of}} neatness, spill control, {{and to some extent}} portion control. In 1957, the sugar packet that consisted of a <b>granulated</b> low-calorie sugar substitute, was invented by Benjamin Eisenstadt, the founder of Cumberland Packing or better known today as the Sweet 'N Low company.|$|E
25|$|In 1904, a mason while {{building}} a mill {{in the top}} of São Félix Hill, {{in the vicinity of the}} smaller Castro de Laundos, found a vase with jewellery inside, these pieces had been bought by Rocha Peixoto that took them to the Museum of Porto. The jewellery was made using an evolved technique, very similar to ones made in the Mediterranean, namely with the use of plates and welds, filigree and <b>granulated.</b>|$|E
25|$|As a sweetener, HFCS {{is often}} {{compared}} to <b>granulated</b> sugar, but manufacturing advantages of HFCS over sugar include {{that it is}} easier to handle and more cost-effective. The United States Food and Drug Administration has determined that HFCS is a safe ingredient for food and beverage manufacturing. There is debate over whether HFCS presents greater health risks than other sweeteners. Uses and exports of HFCS from American producers have continued to grow during the early 21st century.|$|E
25|$|Other {{species of}} Callinectes may be easily {{confused}} with C. sapidus because of overlapping ranges and similar morphology. One species is the lesser blue crab (C. similis). It is found further offshore than the common blue crab, {{and has a}} smoother <b>granulated</b> carapace. Males of the lesser blue crab also have mottled white coloration on the swimming legs, and females have areas of violet coloration on the internal surfaces of the claws. C. sapidus can be distinguished from another related species found within its range, C. ornatus, by number of frontal teeth on the carapace. C.sapidus has four, while C. ornatus has six.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the manager of the life preserver manufacturer placed iron bars inside the cork preservers to meet minimum weight requirements at the time. Many of the life preservers had been filled with cheap and less effective <b>granulated</b> cork and brought up to proper weight by the inclusion of the iron weights. Canvas covers, rotted with age, split and scattered the powdered cork. Managers of the company (Nonpareil Cork Works) were indicted but not convicted. The life preservers had been manufactured in 1891 and had hung above the deck, unprotected from the elements, for 13 years.|$|E
25|$|Work {{began on}} the {{southern}} approach road in July 1972 by Clugston Construction of Scunthorpe. The 2.5km approach road to the A1077 junction, by Costain Civil Engineering began in September 1976. It included a 320m span from the southern anchorage of seven pre-stressed concrete box sections, and the A1077 junction, costing £4.25million. Work on the bridge substructure (foundations) began in March 1973. To reduce heat of hydration in the concrete, which produces calcium silicate hydrate from belite, as much as 60% of the Portland cement was replaced with ground <b>granulated</b> blast-furnace slag (GGBS). It took longer to build the southern anchorage due to a diaphragm wall design due to not enough shallow bedrock. The main southern approach roads from Barton to the M180 motorway junction at Barnetby {{were built in the}} late 1970s by Clugston Construction of Scunthorpe, opening in 1978.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the early}} {{industries}} to establish itself in Johnstown was the Knox gelatine plant. It was built in 1890 by Charles B. Knox, a prominent Johnstown resident, who developed the <b>granulated,</b> unflavored gelatin still used in food preparation today. When Knox died in 1908, his wife Rose Knox assumed management of the business. She {{became one of the}} earliest successful American businesswomen. The Knox family and its philanthropic foundation were generous to the city. Results of their philanthropy can still be found there today. They gave the city the block of land known as Knox Field, where the playgrounds, athletic fields, and bridle path are located. Knox Junior High School was named in honor of the family. The Knox Gelatin plant, once a major employer in Johnstown, closed in 1975 following the sale of the company to the Lipton Tea Company.|$|E
25|$|Type V is used where sulfate {{resistance}} is important. Its typical compound composition is: 38% (C3S), 43% (C2S), 4% (C3A), 9% (C4AF), 1.9% MgO, 1.8% (SO3), 0.9% ignition loss, and 0.8% free CaO. This cement {{has a very}} low (C3A) composition which accounts for its high sulfate resistance. The maximum content of (C3A) allowed is 5% for type V Portland cement. Another limitation is that the (C4AF) + 2(C3A) composition cannot exceed 20%. This type is used in concrete {{to be exposed to}} alkali soil and ground water sulfates which react with (C3A) causing disruptive expansion. It is unavailable in many places, although its use is common in the western United States and Canada. As with type IV, type V Portland cement has mainly been supplanted by the use of ordinary cement with added ground <b>granulated</b> blast furnace slag or tertiary blended cements containing slag and fly ash.|$|E
25|$|Mineral {{admixtures}} {{are becoming}} more popular in recent decades. The use of recycled materials as concrete ingredients has been gaining popularity because of increasingly stringent environmental legislation, and the discovery that such materials often have complementary and valuable properties. The most conspicuous of these are fly ash, a by-product of coal-fired power plants, ground <b>granulated</b> blast furnace slag, a byproduct of steelmaking, and silica fume, a byproduct of industrial electric arc furnaces. The use of these materials in concrete reduces the amount of resources required, as the mineral admixtures act as a partial cement replacement. This displaces some cement production, an energetically expensive and environmentally problematic process, while {{reducing the amount of}} industrial waste that must be disposed of. Mineral admixtures can be pre-blended with the cement during its production for sale and use as a blended cement, or mixed directly with other components when the concrete is produced.|$|E
25|$|Type IV Portland cement is {{generally}} {{known for its}} low heat of hydration. Its typical compound composition is: 28% (C3S), 49% (C2S), 4% (C3A), 12% (C4AF), 1.8% MgO, 1.9% (SO3), 0.9% ignition loss, and 0.8% free CaO. The percentages of (C2S) and (C4AF) are relatively high and (C3S) and (C3A) are relatively low. A limitation on this type is that the maximum percentage of (C3A) is seven, and the maximum percentage of (C3S) is thirty-five. This causes the heat given off by the hydration reaction to develop at a slower rate. However, as a consequence {{the strength of the}} concrete develops slowly. After one or two years the strength is higher than the other types after full curing. This cement is used for very large concrete structures, such as dams, which have a low surface to volume ratio. This type of cement {{is generally}} not stocked by manufacturers, but some might consider a large special order. This type of cement has not been made for many years, because Portland-pozzolan cements and ground <b>granulated</b> blast furnace slag addition offer a cheaper and more reliable alternative.|$|E

500|$|The whitish to pale {{brownish}} stipe is [...] long by [...] {{wide and}} is roughly equal in width throughout its length, or sometimes slightly thicker near the base. Its surface, initially covered with whitish granules, becomes more <b>granulated</b> as the mushroom ages, and typically develops prominent ridges and pits (i.e., becomes [...] ) with maturity. The flesh is whitish, measuring 1–2mm thick {{in the hollow}} cap; it becomes layered and chambered, particularly {{in the base of}} the stipe. The sterile inner surface of the cap is whitish and pubescent (covered with short, soft [...] "hair").|$|E
500|$|A lemon drop is {{typically}} prepared straight up, {{meaning that it}} is shaken or stirred with ice, strained, and served in a stemmed glass, such as a martini glass. The glass may be prepared with a sugared rim, performed by dipping {{the rim of the}} glass in water or lemon juice and then dipping it into a rimmer (a shallow tray used in bartending), filled with sugar. Superfine sugar (also called [...] "bar sugar", [...] "caster sugar", [...] "castor sugar" [...] and [...] "ultrafine sugar"), which is more finely ground compared to standard <b>granulated</b> sugar, is sometimes used for this purpose.|$|E
500|$|The Scotch bonnet, {{scientific}} name Semicassis granulata, is a medium-sized to large species of sea snail, a marine gastropod mollusk in the subfamily Cassinae, the helmet shells and bonnet shells. The common name [...] "Scotch bonnet" [...] {{alludes to the}} general outline and color pattern of the shell, which vaguely resemble a tam o' shanter, a traditional Scottish bonnet or cap. The shell is egg-shaped and fairly large, [...] in maximum dimension, with a regular pattern of yellow, orange or brown squarish spots. The surface sculpture of the shell is highly variable: the surface can be smooth and polished, have grooves, be <b>granulated,</b> or even be nodulose {{on the shoulder of}} the whorls.|$|E
500|$|Matte {{paintings}} of the Austrian castle and German airport were based on real buildings; the Austrian castle was a small West German castle that was made to look larger. Rain was created by filming <b>granulated</b> Borax soap against black at high speed. It was only lightly double exposed into the shots so it would not resemble snow. The lightning was animated. The airport used was at San Francisco's Treasure Island, which already had appropriate art deco architecture. ILM added a control tower, Nazi banners, vintage automobiles and a sign stating [...] "Berlin Flughafen". The establishing shot of the Hatayan city at dusk was created by filming silhouetted cutouts that were backlit and obscured by smoke. Matte paintings {{were used for the}} sky and to give the appearance of fill light in the shadows and rim light on the edges of the buildings.|$|E
