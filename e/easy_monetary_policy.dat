While central banks [...] "averted tremendous human suffering", he argues that they have failed to generate what the Western world really needs—"the combination of high, durable and inclusive growth together with genuine financial stability". Worse still, politicians have {{come to rely on}} central bankers to provide the main source of economic stimulus. As a result, Mr El-Erian asserts, they have failed to force through reforms that were badly needed. The long period of <b>easy</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> has pushed up asset prices and thus wealth inequality. It has also meant that the appetite for financial risks (market speculation, in other words) is greater than the willingness of businesses to take economic risks by increasing investment.|$|E

"There {{is plenty}} of room for {{monetary}} easing" [...] in Japan, Kuroda said in a February 2013 interview, adding that the BOJ could go beyond purchasing government bonds to include corporate bonds [...] "or even stocks". The yen, which [...] "has fallen 10% against the dollar since Abe began his campaign in November", also fell on the news of Kuroda's nomination. However, the new governor is [...] "expected to use his experience as Japan’s top currency official until 2003 to rebut overseas criticism that Tokyo is using <b>easy</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> to drive the yen lower, triggering a war of competitive currency devaluation". Bloomberg quoted Stephen Roach, a senior fellow at Yale University, as saying about Kuroda's goals: “It’s a strong pledge from a well-intended man, but I’m not convinced it’s going to work." [...] When Kuroda was asked the same question in his assumption of office's press conference on March 21, Kuroda said the BOJ's role is to stabilize prices, and stabilizing exchange rates {{is the role of the}} Ministry of Finance. He also said that BOJ's [...] "Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing" [...] policy does not intend to devalue, aiming to grow out of deflation by targeting inflation. Although there was opposition from developing countries, the policy was accepted by the other developed countries in the G20 summit. However, G20 members emphasized to Japanese policymakers that it must be used domestically while highlighting the importance of a Japanese effort to reduce government debt.|$|E
40|$|Our {{investigation}} of banks ’ corporate loan pricing {{policies in the}} United States {{over the past two}} decades finds that monetary policy is an important driver of banks ’ risk-taking incentives. We show that banks charge riskier borrowers (relative to safer borrowers) lower premiums in periods of <b>easy</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> than in periods of tight monetary policy. This interest rate discount is robust to borrower-, loan-, and bank-specific factors, macroe-conomic factors and various types of unobserved heterogeneity at the bank and firm levels. Using individual bank information about lending standards from the Senior Loan Officers Opinion Survey (SLOOS), we unveil evidence that the interest rate discount for riskier borrowers in periods of <b>easy</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> is prevalent among banks with greater risk appetite. This finding confirms that the loan pricing discount we observe is indeed driven by the bank risk-taking channel of monetary policy. JEL classification: G 2...|$|E

Against the background of the prevailing uncertainty, our model provides three important implications for ECB monetary policy: (1) cutting interest rates is not effective as long as high uncertainty continues to prevail; (2) by cutting rates under high uncertainty, the ECB reduces the option value of waiting, thereby reducing its effectiveness in future periods; and (3) a hectic ECB <b>monetary</b> <b>policy,</b> that is frequent interest rate changes, induces additional uncertainty to the economy which would most likely aggravate the weakness of in-vestment and consumer goods demand...|$|R

40|$|The {{manipulation}} of credit {{in the conduct}} of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> is receiving increasing attention in regards to the impact it exerts on asset prices and accompanied volatility. Several authors have claimed that relaxed monetary conditions can induce asset bubbles thereby distorting investment decisions on the part of economic actors, be they corporate managers or, investors. This paper explores the impact of the cost of credit on stock return dynamics in the United Kingdom. More specifically it tests the hypothesis that cheap credit (loose monetary conditions) make it easier for investors to follow trend chasing strategies, or equivalently positive feedback trading. Such strategies can lead to runaway prices or, devastating crashes. The model employed {{is based on the assumption}} that investors are not homogeneous in the sense that some of them follow expected utility maximizing behavior, whereas others follow positive feedback trading strategies. The evidence from the U. K. market suggests that there is positive feedback trading linked to the cost of credit. Specifically, the lowering of the cost of credit in the pursuit of <b>easy</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policies</b> leads to positive feedback trading and possibly to unsustainable price bubbles...|$|R

Pooled data for the 15 members of the European Union except Luxembourg and five other OECD countries serves to answer these questions. Three basic conclusions emerge.

Second, coordinated macroeconomic policy exists: easy fiscal policy leads to tight monetary policy, and <b>easy</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> to tight fiscal policy. Third, both monetary and fiscal policy respond to the cycle in a stabilizing manner, but automatic stabilization through fiscal policy is much weaker than generally perceived.

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{monetary}} policy to slow an overheating economy is rarely questioned. However, {{the efficacy of}} monetary policy to revive a sagging economy has been long debated. Some economists argue that monetary policy is largely powerless to revive economic activity after a downturn, comparing <b>easy</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> to “pushing on a string. ” This idea has garnered renewed attention in recent years, {{in no small part}} due to weak recoveries following the past two recessions, despite aggressive monetary easing.

40|$|A {{financial}} crisis appears {{to occur in}} a certain pattern; it usually starts with a rally of bank credits {{against a backdrop of}} <b>easier</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy,</b> ample liquidity, and more relaxed banking regulations. Such financial environment stimulates excess leverage to fund assets in real estates and housing in which consumers take advantage of cheap money and borrow heavily, while bankers zealously lend out in order to achieve high loan growth targets. As with all levered instruments, this practice generates great profits when the asset value rises. In contrast, it produces great losses when the assets fall in value, forcing lenders to ration credits and to compete aggressively for funds to cover the resultant losses. Retrospectively, the Global Financial Crisis exhibits far reaching implications from the excessive leverage, deregulation and from the spiral effects of globalisation, financial speculation, product innovation, moral hazards, and incentives problems. This paper reflects how similar or different the Global Financial Crisis is from the past crises in terms of its causes and manifestations, how Malaysia was impacted, and what key lessons could be learned from it...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{looks at}} {{macroeconomic}} factors behind the current crisis. The first part looks at how global macroeconomic trends [...] including sustained strong growth, low real interest rates, and high saving rates [...] provided an environment conducive to increased financial risk-taking. The second part examines macroeconomic {{policies and the}} international monetary system, assessing whether too <b>easy</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> contributed to asset price bubbles, whether excessive reserve accumulation contributed to a glut of global savings, whether the US dollar's reserve currency status aggravated financial excesses, and whether policies in capital-importing countries were sufficiently countercyclical. We do not find a single factor that can explain the crisis and account for differences in countries' experiences leading up to it; instead, the contribution of macroeconomic policy choices seems complex and ambiguous. However, there are still important policy lessons for, in particular, rebalancing economies away from export-dominated growth and having monetary policy place greater weight on macrofinancial stability.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{demonstrates that}} the August 2007 financial crisis {{was the result of}} three forces: financial liberalization, financial innovation and <b>easy</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> in a number of countries around the globe. The financial liberalization era allowed financial institutions to initiate a new financial activity, which was based on the discretion of the banks to dispose of their loan portfolio in accordance with risk management. That financial innovation relied heavily on interlinked securities and derivatives, all related to asset backed-securities and subprime mortgages in particular. Subprime mortgages was a financial innovation designed to enable home ownership to risky borrowers. It is, therefore, the contention of this contribution that the origins of the current financial crisis can be explained by these three interrelated features that have been going on since the 1970 s. But the root of the current financial crisis is the creation and subsequent developments in the subprime mortgage market, the focus of this contribution...|$|E

(2006), we develop a microfounded macro New-Keynesian model for open economies, be them large or small, and we investigate {{the exchange rate}} pass-through to import prices {{in the context of}} a <b>monetary</b> <b>policy.</b> More specifically, we study two different versions of a Taylor rule (without and with interest rate smoothing), each in contemporaneous, backward-looking and forward-looking form, focusing on the interdependence between the degree of pass-through and the effectiveness of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy.</b> Confirming the findings from the literature we show that there is an adverse relationship between the efficiency of <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> and the exchange rate pass-through. Irrespective of the nature of the shock and the form of the <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> rule, a lower pass-through implies a lower variability of the economy, making the <b>monetary</b> policymaking <b>easier,</b> since different <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> rules produce comparable results.

Significant asset price increases, however, can also occur when interest rates are in line with Taylor rules, associated with periods of financial deregulation and/or innovation. The paper argues that accommodating monetary policy over the period 2002 - 2005, in combination with rapid financial market innovation, would seem in retrospect to have been among the factors behind the run-up in asset prices and financial imbalances [...] the (partial) unwinding of which helped trigger the 2007 / 08 financial market turmoil.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{main purpose}} of this article is to analyze how {{sovereign}} risk influences the loan supply reaction of banks to <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> through the bank lending channel. Additionally, we aim to test whether this reaction differs in <b>easy</b> and tight <b>monetary</b> regimes. Using a sample of 3, 125 banks from the euro zone between 1999 and 2012, we find that sovereign risk plays an important role in determining loan supply from banks during tight monetary regimes. Banks in higher sovereign risk countries reduce lending more during tight regimes. However, we find little evidence to support any relationship between sovereign risk and loan supply reaction to <b>monetary</b> <b>policy</b> expansions.
