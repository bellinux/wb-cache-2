25|$|Maimonides {{argued that}} time was {{required}} between meat and dairy produce because meat can become stuck in the teeth, a problem he suggested would last for about six hours after eating it; this interpretation was shared by Solomon ben Aderet, a prominent pupil of his, and Asher ben Jehiel, who gained entry to the rabbinate by Solomon ben Aderet's approval, {{as well as by}} the later Shulchan Aruch. By contrast, tosafists argued that the key detail was just the avoidance of dairy produce appearing at the same meal as meat. Therefore, it was sufficient to <b>just</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> a new meal—which to them simply meant clearing the table, reciting a particular blessing, and cleaning their mouths. Some later rabbinic writers, like Moses Isserles, and significant texts, like the Zohar (as noted by Vilna Gaon and Daniel Josiah Pinto), argued that a meal still did not qualify as new unless at least an hour had passed since the previous meal.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Clarence Waldron from Jet, Cole said the idea of recording a Christmas album started after {{a telephone call from}} producer and longtime friend Michael Masser, with whom Cole had worked on the song [...] "Someone That I Used to Love" [...] from her 1980 album Don't Look Back and her 1989 single [...] "Miss You Like Crazy". Cole described the telephone call from Masser as unexpected; Masser told her, [...] "I've got this beautiful Christmas song I wrote just for you". When they met, Messer played [...] "No More Blue Christmas"; after the session they both agreed to record a Christmas album. Cole described the decision to form a Christmas album as leaving her [...] "running around in April, looking for Christmas songs". Cole expressed hope that the album would remind her fans about [...] "the true spirit of the holiday season". She wanted it to communicate that Christmas is [...] "a time for families to reflect and not <b>just</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the holidays to be a family". Cole's twin sister Timolin Cole said, [...] "Christmas Eve has always been a magical time with Natalie" [...] when she could connect with family over holiday traditions.|$|E
500|$|Other {{critics were}} less positive. The Herald Suns head {{reviewer}} Leigh Paatsch gave the film no stars, claiming the film tried {{to match the}} edginess of the 2007 comedy film Juno but was, [...] "way, way off the mark". He wrote, [...] "If you think the title screams 'Go watch something else', <b>just</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> you get a load of this lame local production." [...] Jim Schembri of The Age opined that the film {{was an example of}} [...] "just how bad local [...] films can get". In particular, he criticised the [...] "stiff" [...] performances, the [...] "woeful" [...] directing and the plot's implausibility. Variety magazine's Richard Kuipers wrote that the film was [...] "sporadically amusing" [...] and lacked [...] "scripting smarts and pulling power across demographics". He praised the soundtrack and Castle-Hughes' portrayal of Sunni, but felt that the film was brought down by dull cinematography and [...] "uninspired dialogue and direction". Bernadette McNulty of The Daily Telegraph noted that the film's greatest downfall was that [...] "the jokes aren't funny enough and the sadness barely breaks your heart". She complimented Toni Collette's performance but felt that [...] "her slight role is insufficient to make it fly the distance". Luke Goodsell, writing for Empire magazine, awarded the film 2 out of 5 stars and deemed it to be deserving of [...] "an all-purpose warning label to stay the Hell away".|$|E

2500|$|Formula One driver Bruno Senna is {{the nephew}} of Senna (being his sister Viviane's son) of whom he said in 1993: [...] "If you think I'm fast, <b>just</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> you see my nephew Bruno." [...] Due {{to the death of}} his uncle, Bruno {{initially}} gave up motor racing at his family's insistence. He eventually raced in F1 between 2010 and 2012, in the latter year for the Williams team, which was a decision that, reportedly, had a significant emotional impact on the Senna family and was seen by some as a signing only resulting from Bruno's big name and the money it could bring.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the future}} of Savatage, {{frontman}} Jon Oliva explained, [...] "As far as that goes, the whole Wacken thing came up, and I was, like, you know what? If we're going to do anything, {{we have to do}} it now. I don't want to do it when I'm 60 years old. I mentioned that to Paul. He said to me, 'We're going to do the Wacken thing, but let's <b>just</b> <b>wait</b> <b>until</b> the winter tour is over and then you and me we're going to sit down in January and discuss what we're going to do.'" [...] Oliva also said that Savatage has [...] "already gotten offers" [...] to play in [...] "certain areas of the world, America being one, Greece, South America, places like that", and added that he does not rule out the possibility of any more shows. Though Oliva said he does not know what the future holds for Savatage, he said, [...] "I just wish that everything works out good and then we'll see what happens down the road. I'll never say no to anything anymore, because every time I do, I get rained on." ...|$|E

5000|$|In a 2008 interview, Kershaw {{spoke of}} the album. [...] "You've Got to Laugh took about five years to get together. That wasn't intense recording, obviously. I <b>just</b> <b>waited</b> <b>until</b> I'd got enough tracks {{and that was the}} time to release it. Had it not been for my girlfriend, it {{probably}} wouldn't have been released at all. The songs are all about my own experiences or those of people around me; they're about friends and foes; they're about real life, which means there's nothing too glamorous going on".|$|R

2500|$|Cole {{said several}} of the tracks are songs that he held onto before he was signed. He said they were too good to give away on mixtapes. Cole stated that he had 16 tracks on the album, 12 of which he has {{produced}} himself. He also revealed {{that he would not}} release a pre-album mixtape like he previously stated. Instead, every Sunday until the album he released songs that did not make the album. The bundles of songs released are called Any Given Sundays. Cole said that the reason for the subtitle [...] "The Sideline Story" [...] is because he feels since being signed to Jay-Z it has been like someone being on the sidelines for their favorite basketball team, and they're <b>just</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> the coach puts them in.|$|R

5000|$|Early reviews were {{overwhelmingly}} positive. Todd Brown, {{founder and}} editor of Twitch Film, gave a highly positive review of the film, saying that [...] "a tale that weds absolutely gorgeous artwork with beautifully nuanced characters and a deep but natural rooting in ancient folk tales and magic, Song of the Sea has an assured and timeless quality to it. It {{is the sort of}} story that feels as though it always existed somewhere, <b>just</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> now to be told". [...] "Song of the Sea is not about selling units, it's about story and heart and emotion and wonder and craftsmanship and because of that it becomes timeless, a beautiful piece of art that will delight audiences old and young and confirms what many suspected of Moore after Kells: The man's a master storyteller, and we can only hope he has many, many more stories to tell." ...|$|R

40|$|Historians usually {{describe}} the parliamentary offer of the Crown to Oliver Cromwell in 1657 {{as something of}} a self-fulfilling prophecy. Throughout the second Protectorate Parliament, plans to create a Cromwellian monarchy were ‘secretly maturing’; the civilian members of parliament (MPs), tired of military rule, were <b>just</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>until</b> the ‘time was right’. While this article does not seek to deny that many MPs were thinking of constitutional change from an early stage, it will demonstrate that the form of settlement first proposed in the opening months of the second protectorate Parliament was very different to the one eventually embodied in the Humble Petition and Advice. Rather than marking a process of inevitable backsliding towards monarchy, the constitutional debates during the opening months of the second Protectorate Parliament can best be understood by consideration of previous succession crises. In their first motions for constitutional reform, MPs did not seek to make Cromwell king; they proposed to make him a hereditary Protector. By February 1657, however, all mention of hereditary government disappeared suddenly; the parliamentary constitution offered to Cromwell the following month centred upon a non-hereditary monarchy. This article will demonstrate that by failing to trace the development of the scheme to make the supreme magistracy hereditary, and the reasons why it was abandoned in early 1657, historians have failed to appreciate both the motives of those who went on to offer the Crown to Cromwell and the flawed nature of the constitution once Cromwell refused that offer in May 1657...|$|R
