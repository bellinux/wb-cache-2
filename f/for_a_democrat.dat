5|$|The state's liquor {{prohibition}} law was a {{major political}} issues at the time, and Talbot was a strict prohibitionist. During this term he vetoed {{a bill that would}} have disbanded the state police, which were charged with the law's enforcement, and also vetoed a bill replacing prohibition with a licensing scheme. In the 1874 election, anti-prohibition Republicans joined with Democrats to elect William Gaston over Talbot by a narrow margin. The election marked a watershed in post-Civil War Massachusetts, since it was the first victory <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> in that period, and exposed the state Republican Party's fractures on domestic affairs like prohibition. Talbot refused to run in 1875.|$|E
25|$|While the {{previous}} Democratic Governor, Mark Warner, {{was credited with}} doing especially well <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> in rural areas of the commonwealth, Kaine's win featured surprising triumphs in traditionally Republican areas such as Virginia Beach, Chesapeake, and the Northern Virginia suburbs of Prince William County and Loudoun County, as well as impressive showings in Democratic strongholds such as Richmond and Norfolk.|$|E
25|$|In his 2010 {{campaign}} for reelection, Walter Minnick, the U.S. Representative for Idaho's 1st congressional district, {{was endorsed by}} Tea Party Express, an extremely rare occurrence <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democrat.</b> Minnick was the only Democrat to receive a 100% rating from the Club for Growth, an organization the typically supports conservative Republicans. Minnick ultimately lost to Ra√∫l Labrador, a conservative Republican, in the general election.|$|E
50|$|Rogers was a Republican. He {{was elected}} to the Wisconsin Senate in 1902, {{receiving}} 7,380 votes against 5,739 votes cast <b>for</b> <b>A.</b> Huebschmann (<b>a</b> <b>Democrat),</b> and 1,758 votes cast for Vie Peterson.|$|R

25|$|The {{majority}} of Harris County voters are white and {{have tended to}} vote Republican at the presidential level since the mid-20th century; Barack Obama was the first Democrat to win the county since Texas native Lyndon Johnson in 1964. Democratic strength {{is found in the}} city of Houston. Suburban areas such as Cypress, Spring, and Katy in the county's western and northern areas, tend to be strongly Republican. In 2016, Hillary Clinton won the county by the largest margins <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> since 1964.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, Sen. Max Cleland (D-Ga.) was {{involved}} in a contentious re-election campaign against Republican Congressman Saxby Chambliss. The race galvanized Democrats across the nation, who said Chambliss had questioned the patriotism of Cleland, a disabled Vietnam veteran. Miller remained true to the Democrats in this case, campaigning hard for Cleland despite their ideological differences. But after Chambliss won, Miller formed a close working relationship with him. He also moved even further to the right, presumably because it had become increasingly difficult <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> to win statewide in Georgia.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, of the 11 {{states in which}} {{amendments}} defining marriage were on the ballot, all passed handily. Bush won in nine, including Ohio. Interpretation of some exit polling suggests that the amendments may have brought out one million additional voters, most of which came {{out for the first}} time to cast their ballots for Bush. Notably, a vast majority of these states have not voted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> in many years. The two states that Bush did not win, Michigan and Oregon, still passed amendments limiting official recognition of marriage to one man one woman unions.|$|E

25|$|The {{state has}} not voted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> for {{president}} since 1964. Historically, Republican presidential nominees score {{one of their}} best margins of victory here. Utah was the Republicans' best state in the 1976, 1980, 1984, 1988, 1996, 2000, and 2004 elections. In 1992, Utah was the only {{state in the nation}} where Democratic candidate Bill Clinton finished behind both Republican candidate George HW Bush and Independent candidate Ross Perot. In 2004, Republican George W. Bush won every county in the state and Utah gave him his largest margin of victory of any state. He won the state's five electoral votes by a margin of 46 percentage points with 71.5% of the vote. In the 1996 Presidential elections the Republican candidate received a smaller 54% of the vote while the Democrat earned 34%.|$|E
25|$|On paper, the redrawn 17th {{appeared}} to so heavily favor Gekas that it appeared unwinnable <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democrat,</b> even one as conservative as Holden. To some, it was blatant gerrymandering to force Holden into retirement. Gekas retained 60% {{of his former}} territory, and George W. Bush had carried the newly drawn district with 57% {{of the vote in}} 2000. However, to the surprise of many observers, Holden did not retire, instead opting to run in a district that was 65% new to him (a small corner from the even more Republican 9th District was moved to the 17th). Gekas was forced into his first real campaign ever. Holden managed to gain endorsements from much of Gekas' old base, much to Gekas' surprise. Even Gekas' hometown paper, The Patriot-News, endorsed Holden, saying that the 17th was not the same district that elected Gekas in 1982. Gekas got another rude surprise when Holden visited African American neighborhoods such as Uptown and Allison Hill after finding out that Gekas had never set foot in these neighborhoods in his congressional career. He asked the residents of these neighborhoods not to vote for a congressman who didn't bother to visit them. In November 2002, in one of the biggest upsets in recent political history, Holden narrowly defeated Gekas.|$|E
500|$|Another would-be heir to Tilden was Samuel J. Randall, since 1863 {{a congressman}} from Philadelphia. Like Tilden, Randall was {{conservative}} {{on the money}} question but, unusually <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democrat,</b> he supported high tariffs to protect American industry. He also advocated legislation to reduce the power of monopolies. Tilden had supported Randall in his quest to become Speaker of the House, and Randall returned the favor by remaining a loyal Tilden man up to the convention. [...] He now hoped {{for the support of}} the former Tilden adherents in his quest for the presidency. Former Governor Thomas A. Hendricks of Indiana, Tilden's 1876 running mate, also sought a claim on the previous nominee's support. He came from a crucial swing state that the Democrats had narrowly carried in 1876 and had some support in the Midwestern states. [...] His popularity with delegates from the Northeast was impaired by his views on the currency question; he sided with those who wanted looser money.|$|E
50|$|On {{election}} {{night for the}} 1876 presidential race, John Runyan was harassed <b>for</b> being <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> by Charles Presnall {{when they were both}} in New Castle, Indiana. Runyan shot and killed him with his revolver even though he could have retreated.|$|R

50|$|Doty ran <b>for</b> {{president}} as <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> in the 1984 and 1988 elections. In 1988, when he spent approximately $20,000, he received 1,005 votes.|$|R
500|$|Bryan faced {{a number}} of {{disadvantages}} in seeking the Democratic nomination: he was little-known among Americans who did not follow politics closely, he had no money to pour into his campaign, he lacked public office, and had incurred the enmity of Cleveland and his administration through his stance on silver and other issues. [...] There was little advantage to the Democratic Party in nominating a candidate from Nebraska, a state small in population that had never voted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democrat.</b> [...] As state conventions met to nominate delegates to the July national convention, for the most part, they supported silver, and sent silver men to Chicago. [...] Gold Democrats had success in the Northeast, and little elsewhere. [...] Most state conventions did not bind, or [...] "instruct", their delegates {{to vote for a}} specific candidate for the nomination; this course was strongly supported by Bryan. [...] Once delegates were selected, Bryan wrote to party officials and obtained a list; he sent copies of his speeches, clippings from the World-Herald, and his photograph to each delegate.|$|E
2500|$|Bayh {{was elected}} to the U.S. Senate in 1998 to the seat that was once held by his father. He won with 64% of the vote, the largest margin ever {{recorded}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> in a U.S. Senate race in Indiana, defeating former Fort Wayne Mayor Paul Helmke.|$|E
2500|$|Liberal Democrats, too, flinched before Brown. Adlai E. Stevenson, front-runner for the party's presidential {{nomination}} in 1956, urged {{the government to}} [...] "proceed gradually" [...] on school desegregation in deference to the South's long-held [...] "traditions." [...] Stevenson backed integration but opposed using armed personnel to enforce Brown....It certainly helped. Stevenson carried most of Dixie in the fall campaign but received just 61 {{percent of the black}} vote, low <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democrat,</b> and lost the election to Eisenhower by a landslide.|$|E

2500|$|On HBO's Real Time with Bill Maher July 15, 2011, {{during a}} panel {{discussion}} of the debt limit increase negotiations between the U.S. Congress and President Barack Obama, Savage said in a stand-alone remark, [...] "I wish the Republicans were all fucking dead." [...] He apologized for his remarks on his blog later the same night saying in part, [...] "I don't feel that way. My dad is a Republican.

2500|$|Louisiana {{is unique}} among U.S. states in using {{a system for}} its state and local {{elections}} {{similar to that of}} modern France. All candidates, regardless of party affiliation, run in a nonpartisan blanket primary (or [...] "jungle primary") on Election Day. If no candidate has more than 50% of the vote, the two candidates with the highest vote totals compete in a runoff election approximately one month later. This run-off did not take into account party identification; therefore, it was not uncommon <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> to be in a runoff with a fellow Democrat or a Republican to be in a runoff with a fellow Republican.|$|E
2500|$|Popper is {{a member}} of the Libertarian Party, and has {{previously}} expressed support for the Republican Party. He endorsed George W. Bush in the 2004 U.S. presidential election. In November 2008, Popper said, regarding Barack Obama, [...] "this is the first time I've voted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democrat,</b> ever." [...] John Popper was a supporter of Ron Paul during the 2012 U.S. Presidential election, even participating in phone-banking at Ron Paul's New Hampshire campaign headquarters.

2500|$|In 1994, {{moderate}} and conservative Democrats within the U.S. House of Representatives organized {{themselves into the}} Blue Dog Democrats, {{in response to the}} Republican victories at the polls that November. The explanation was that the Blue Dogs felt the party had moved so far left that it had [...] "choked them blue." [...] The name is a reference to an earlier term, Yellow dog Democrat (typically, a southerner who would vote <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> even if a [...] "yellow dog" [...] were the Democratic candidate) and also to the [...] "blue dog" [...] paintings of a Louisiana artist. The Blue Dog Coalition is not considered as conservative as the earlier Dixiecrat and Boll Weevil incarnations of conservative Democrats.|$|E
2500|$|He used {{new media}} to [...] "form {{a bond with}} his supporters" [...] which helped him [...] "appeal to the youth audience's need to feel special, in-the-know, {{empowered}} and special". This was best displayed in his text message announcement of Joe Biden as the vice-presidential candidate. He has also declared, in his book The Audacity of Hope, {{that he did not}} experience a religious upbringing. Rather he developed his faith due to the church's ability to motivate social change. Bowdern wrote, [...] "This is best exemplified in his [...] "50 state strategy", meaning that he campaigned in states that historically would never vote <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democrat.</b> The 2008 presidential election saw a large youth turn out, up to 51%." ...|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{switched}} {{parties to}} run for Congress: [...] "I have never voted <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>Democrat</b> for President, {{and the only way}} for the Republican Party to grow is for Democrats to switch over." [...] He quickly emerged as the leading Republican candidate in the new Louisiana nonpartisan blanket primary format to choose a successor to retiring Democratic Representative Joe Waggonner of Plain Dealing. Wilson did not switch parties until after Waggonner declared that he would not seek reelection. The Republican leadership, under state chairman George Despot of Shreveport, considered endorsing either state Representatives Art Sour of Shreveport, or Bruce Lynn, or a younger prospect, Bossier City council member Chester J. [...] "Buzz" [...] Wojecki. The party finally decided in caucus to anoint Wilson as the candidate most electable in the historically Democratic district.|$|E
