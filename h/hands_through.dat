5|$|The first {{championship}} {{defense of}} WrestleMania was between Junkyard Dog and the reigning WWF Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion Greg Valentine, who was accompanied {{to the ring}} by his manager Jimmy Hart. Junkyard Dog began the match in the offensive position, performing headbutts and punches on Valentine. As the action went back and forth, Hart climbed on the ring apron, where Valentine accidentally hit him. Later, Valentine pinned Junkyard Dog with {{his feet on the}} ropes for leverage, which is an illegal maneuver. As a result, Tito Santana ran down to the ring and explained to the referee what had happened and the match was restarted. Junkyard Dog eventually won the match by count-out as Valentine failed to re-enter the ring. Valentine, however, kept his title as titles do not change <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> count-out.|$|E
5|$|Much of Livingstone's {{first two}} years were devoted to setting up the Mayoral system and administration. He also devoted much time to battling New Labour's plans to upgrade the London Underground system through a public–private {{partnership}} (PPP) program, believing it to be too expensive and tantamount to the privatisation of a state-owned service. He furthermore had strong concerns about safety; PPP would divide {{different parts of the}} Underground among various companies, something that he argued threatened a holistic safety and maintenance program. These concerns were shared by the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) and the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) trade union, who went on strike over the issue, being joined on the picket line by Livingstone. Appointing Bob Kiley as transport commissioner, the duo argued that the upgrade should be carried out in state <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> a public bond issue, as had been done {{in the case of the}} New York City Subway. They launched court cases against the government over PPP in 2001–02, but were ultimately unsuccessful, and the project went ahead, with the Underground being privatised in January 2003.|$|E

25|$|Over {{the course}} of the War, despite {{occasional}} tactical victories and spectacular counter-stroke raids, Confederate control of many regions of Virginia was gradually lost to Federal advance. By October 1862 the northern 9th and 10th Congressional districts along the Potomac were under Union control. Eastern Shore, Northern, Middle and Lower Peninsula and the 2nd congressional district surrounding Norfolk west to Suffolk were permanently Union-occupied by May. Other regions, such as the Piedmont and Shenandoah Valley, regularly changed <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> numerous campaigns.|$|E

500|$|Even in the 18th {{century the}} site was still {{associated}} with traditions and rituals, by then relating to Norse gods. The [...] "Odin Stone" [...] was pierced with a circular hole, and was used by local couples for plighting engagements by holding <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> the gap. In the early 19th century a local landowner and recent immigrant to Orkney decided to remove the Stones {{on the grounds that}} local people were trespassing and disturbing his land in using the stones. He started in December 1814 by smashing the Odin Stone. This caused outrage and he was stopped after destroying one other stone and toppling another. The toppled stone was re-erected in 1906 along with some inaccurate reconstruction inside the circle.|$|E
500|$|The {{commonly}} heard {{female contact}} call is a shrill, kew-wick but the male has a quavering advertising song hoo...ho, ho, hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo. William Shakespeare used this owl's song in Love's Labour's Lost (Act 5, Scene 2) as [...] "Then nightly sings the staring owl, Tu-whit; Tu-who, a merry note, While greasy Joan doth keel the pot", but this stereotypical call {{is actually a}} duet, with the female making the kew-wick sound, and the male responding hooo. The call is easily imitated by blowing into cupped <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> slightly parted thumbs, and a study in Cambridgeshire found that this mimicry produced a response from the owl within 30minutes in 94% of trials. A male's response to a broadcast song appears to be indicative of his health and vigour; owls with higher blood parasite loads use fewer high frequencies and a more limited range of frequencies in their responses to an apparent intruder.|$|E
500|$|While Amusement Vision was {{responsible}} for most of the game's development, Nintendo EAD employees Shigeru Miyamoto and Takaya Imamura took on the role of producer and supervisor, respectively. Sega handled planning and execution and Nintendo {{was responsible}} for supervision of their product. Nagoshi was initially concerned about differences in opinion between the two companies, and mentioned [...] "If Nintendo planned to hold our <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> development, I would have suggested they develop the game themselves. That way we could focus on a project which would reflect our studio's abilities. I figured that would cause a war, but I was told most of the responsibility would be left to us." [...] Miyamoto thought the collaboration resulted in a [...] "true evolution of the F-Zero series", enhancing the simulation of racing at high speeds and expanding the [...] "F-Zero world on a grand scale." [...] Published by Nintendo, F-Zero GX was released in Japan on July 25, 2003, in North America on August 25, 2003, and in PAL regions on October 31, 2003. The Arcade version was released in 2003 alongside its Gamecube counterpart.|$|E

500|$|The next track, [...] "Skew It On the Bar-B" [...] {{features}} rapper Raekwon of the Wu-Tang Clan {{and discusses}} the disappointment of the group's debut album not achieving the coveted [...] "five-mic" [...] rating from The Source: [...] "I gotta hit the Source / I need my other half mic / because that Southernplayalisticadillacmusik {{was a classic}} right?". [...] "Skew It On the Bar-B" [...] {{is followed by the}} title track, which has been compared to the music of soul singer Isaac Hayes. Pogue experimented with delays and echos in his production to make the song [...] "dimensional, like you could actually put your <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> the song." [...] "Synthesizer" [...] contains elements of electrofunk and features funk musician George Clinton. Emma Warren of The Guardian called the track [...] "raw and woozy", dubbing it the [...] "weirdest moment of the record". On the seventh track, [...] "Slump", Big Boi is joined by two members of the Dungeon Family as they describe their experiences selling dope. One of the few tracks that doesn’t have Andre on it, since he is the [...] "unique" [...] one of the group, while Big Boi is more of the traditional gangster. On [...] "West Savannah", Big Boi discusses his Southern roots, and references individuals who grew up outside of the South who fail to recognize different regional Southern identities by stating [...] "You might call us country, but we's only Southern".|$|E
500|$|The Crows' {{insistence that}} reading is useless, even {{dangerous}} for Scarecrow because it only leads to discontentment takes on an especially haunting {{reminder of the}} ways in which the residues of slavery continue to injure contemporary African Americans. The Crows reinforce Scarecrow's subjection at their <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> a song whose refrain [...] "you can't win child, you can't get out of the game" [...] that aims to disabuse Scarecrow of any aspirations toward freedom... Their insistence that [...] "reading is stupid" [...] suggests that a Eurocentric education does not promise liberation from [...] "the game" [...] that race and racism create... The Crow's dismissal of education and western thought fails because they do not offer Scarecrow an alternative that will emancipate him. The Crow's attempt to discipline Scarecrow by displacing his hope with nihilism. For The Crow's so-called book of knowledge is less valuable than what they perceive to be real knowledge-street smarts. Though they are not tethered to a pole, they are seemingly unable or as their commandments and anthem suggests, unwilling to find opportunities than their present location provides. The Crow's chorus to Scarecrow's song is revealing for what it says about their loss of hope... The Crow's are even more disadvantaged than Scarecrow because, unlike him, they are hopeless. The Crow's chorus, like The Crow Commandments, reflects their disillusionment with their inability to realize the promise of upward mobility.|$|E

2500|$|Even in the 18th {{century the}} site was still {{associated}} with traditions and rituals, by then relating to Norse gods. It was visited by Walter Scott in 1814.

2500|$|I have {{discovered}} that {{the public in the}} Holy Land does not fully believe the terrible horror that has befallen our nation in exile. Sadly, the bitter truth is many, many times worse than anything you have heard. All that is known in the free world is but a drop in the ocean of massacres battering European Jewry. To all those doubters, I can bear witness from my own personal experience that all current descriptions are as nothing compared with the awful truth. On leaving Hungary, I saw with my own eyes wagonloads of Italian Jews being transported to their death in Poland. Elderly, women, young children, pushing their shrunken <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> the bars, begging for [...] "Water! Water!" [...] But the Gestapo troops did not allow anyone to approach the death train and assist the captives. I saw prisoners crazed from thirst attacking each other and biting their flesh.|$|E

2500|$|Duffy {{completed}} the screenplay in fall of 1996 {{and passed it}} to a producer's assistant at New Line Cinema to be read by a senior executive. The screenplay changed <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> multiple studios and Duffy was approached by multiple producers for the rights. In March 1997, he was contracted by Paramount Pictures for $500,000, {{and later in the}} month, Miramax Films won a bidding war to buy The Boondock Saints. The studio offered $450,000 to Duffy to write and direct the film. The documentary Overnight, which chronicled Duffy's [...] "rags-to-riches-to-rags" [...] story, showed that the script was worth $300,000, and the film itself was originally given a $15 million budget by Miramax's Harvey Weinstein. Duffy's band The Brood would do the soundtrack, and as a bonus, Miramax offered to buy and throw in co-ownership of J. Sloan's, where Duffy worked. Overnight showed that Duffy frequently exhibited abrasive behavior, causing tension for many people involved in the project. [...] Filming of The Boondock Saints was scheduled for the coming autumn in Boston.|$|E

The singer sports a natural look in the artwork; barefoot and wearing only an oversized, thin white T-shirt as she runs her <b>hands</b> <b>through</b> her hair. Jonathan Borge of InStyle opined that the cover art was enough to cause excitement on its own. Eric Diep from Complex said Gomez [...] "slays the cover artwork" [...] and felt it implied her upcoming album would substantiate her maturity as an artist. Idolator's Mike Wass opined that the artwork was a good look for Gomez which manifested maturity, and {{said that it was}} [...] "yet another indication that the next phase of her career will come as something of a shock to long-term fans". Laura Beck of Cosmopolitan called the cover art [...] "insanely sexy" [...] and [...] "gorgeous", and added: [...] "All this lady needs to look amazing is a T-shirt and a stool. Impressive". Wass, Corrine Heller of E! and Amanda Bell of MTV News all commended Gomez's sex appeal in the cover art, while other critics complimented the artwork's beauty and simplicity.|$|E
