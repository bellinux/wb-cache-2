40|$|Self-criticism {{has been}} shown to be a {{vulnerability}} factor that can lead to and maintain depression. We examined the moderating effect of fear of receiving compassion <b>from</b> <b>others</b> on the positive association between self-criticism and depression. Self-report measures were administered to four separate samples (total N = 701) varying in age (students and community adults) and cultural context (Canada, England, and Portugal). Two different measures of self-criticism and of depression were administered to investigate the generalizability of results. Self-criticism, depression, and fear of compassion <b>from</b> <b>others</b> were positively related to one another in all samples. As predicted, fear of compassion <b>from</b> <b>others</b> exerted a moderating effect on the relationship between self-criticism and depression. Low fear of compassion <b>from</b> <b>others</b> weakened the depressogenic effect of self-criticism, while high fear of compassion <b>from</b> <b>others</b> exacerbated the effect. Thus, a self-critic's ability to be open and responsive to care and support <b>from</b> <b>others</b> protected against depression. The aggregate moderating effect across the four studies was of medium size (d + =. 53) and highly significant, indicating a robust phenomenon. Implications for working with self-critical depressed patients are discussed...|$|R

Additionally, K. langenbergensis differs <b>from</b> <b>other</b> species in lacking teeth with low crowns; having a longer maxillary symphysis; having a crest {{on the side of}} the downward-projecting process of the postorbital; having overlap between the postorbital and the front of the squamosal; and a rectangular parietal that does not form part of the supratemporal fenestra.|$|E
