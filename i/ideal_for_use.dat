5|$|While {{designed}} for smartness and equality, the Scout uniform is also practical. Shirts traditionally have thick seams {{to make them}} <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in makeshift stretchers—Scouts were trained to use them in this way with their staves, a traditional but deprecated item. The leather straps and toggles of the campaign hats or Leaders' Wood Badges {{could be used as}} emergency tourniquets, or anywhere that string was needed in a hurry. Neckerchiefs were chosen as they could easily be used as a sling or triangular bandage by a Scout in need. Scouts were encouraged to use their garters for shock cord where necessary.|$|E

25|$|Fiber optic {{microphones}} do {{not react}} to or influence any electrical, magnetic, electrostatic or radioactive fields (this is called EMI/RFI immunity). The fiber optic microphone design is therefore <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> {{in areas where}} conventional microphones are ineffective or dangerous, such as inside industrial turbines or in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) equipment environments.|$|E

25|$|After the War, it {{was decided}} that the school would not move back to Lee-on-the-Solent. Ted learned that Great Ballard Estate in New Milton was on the market for sale. With the large Arts and Craft house, {{vegetable}} garden and about 40 acres of land it was <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> as a school. As neither he nor Stuart Cruickshank could raise the capital to purchase, Ted negotiated a lease and the school took occupation in January 1946.|$|E
25|$|The BCC SRTV-22 (Osprey) variant has an {{internal}} crew of three with options for two additional crew or two (roll protected) patients, but loses either one crew member or patient as required. The variant {{is designed to}} quickly load and unload from the V-22 with no major adjustments other than collapsing the roll protection. Additionally, it is less than 900lbs per wheel, making it <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> as an Internally Transportable Vehicle (ITV) and can be ordered with the V-22 trailer.|$|E
25|$|Davuls were <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> as {{military}} instruments {{because of the}} unique {{way in which they}} could be carried. The Ottoman janissaries, for example, hung their davuls at their breasts with thick straps. This made it easier for the soldiers to carry their instruments from battle to battle. This practice {{does not seem to be}} limited to just the Ottoman Empire, however; in Egypt, drums very similar to davuls were braced with cords, which allowed the Egyptian soldiers to carry them during military movements.|$|E

25|$|Cuttings {{of sweet}} potato vine, either edible or {{ornamental}} cultivars, will rapidly form roots {{in water and}} will grow in it, indefinitely, in good lighting with {{a steady supply of}} nutrients. For this reason, sweet potato vine is <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in home aquariums, trailing out of the water with its roots submerged, as its rapid growth is fueled by toxic ammonia and nitrates, a waste product of aquatic life, which it removes from the water. This improves the living conditions for fish, which also find refuge in the vast root systems.|$|E
25|$|Intending {{to improve}} on the RX 550, Spectrum {{introduced}} the Beaver RX 650 in 1991, intending to place it in the Advanced Ultra-light Aeroplane category (AULA) in Canada. The RX 650 has doors that fold upwards, making it <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> on floats. The cockpit cage was changed to welded steel tube, from the previously used aluminum and a sprung tailwheel was added. In service the 650 quickly proved to have structural issues and its acceptance in the AULA category was rescinded by Transport Canada until the issues could be rectified. Most customer 650s were kept flying by operating them in the Basic Ultra-light Aeroplane category. Spectrum Aircraft {{went out of business}} in 1992, prior to rectifying the issues with the 650.|$|E
500|$|At the Berkeley Radiation Lab, Lawrence offered Segrè {{a job as}} a {{research}} assistant—a relatively lowly position for someone who had discovered an element—for [...] a month for six months. When Lawrence learned that Segrè was legally trapped in California, he reduced Segrè's salary to $116 a month. Working with Glenn Seaborg, Segrè isolated the metastable isotope technetium-99m. Its properties made it <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in nuclear medicine, and it is now used in about 10 million medical diagnostic procedures annually. Segrè went looking for element 93, but did not find it, as he was looking for an element chemically akin to rhenium instead of a rare-earth element, which is what element 93 was. Working with Alexander Langsdorf, Jr., and Chien-Shiung Wu, he discovered xenon-135, which later became important as a nuclear poison in nuclear reactors.|$|E

2500|$|When used on {{fuel from}} {{commercial}} power reactors the plutonium extracted typically contains too much Pu-240 {{to be considered}} [...] "weapons-grade" [...] plutonium, <b>ideal</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> in a nuclear weapon. Nevertheless, highly reliable nuclear weapons can be built {{at all levels of}} technical sophistication using reactor-grade plutonium. Moreover, reactors that are capable of refueling frequently can be used to produce weapon-grade plutonium, which can later be recovered using PUREX. Because of this, PUREX chemicals are monitored.|$|E
2500|$|In 1940, Palmdale Army Airfield was {{activated}} as a United States Army Air Corps (later Air Forces) airfield {{for use as}} {{an emergency}} landing strip and for B-25 Mitchell medium bomber support training during World War II.
