40|$|The HVAC systems {{utilizing}} {{renewable energy}} sources {{are one of the}} main contributors towards the fossil fuel dependency reduction. Among these, the ground source heat pump systems, especially those based on vertical ground heat exchanger, are very attractive, due to their high efficiency. The size of the systems depends on the building (geometry, construction materials, orientation etc. but also usage and internal gains), on the ground thermophysical characteristics, on the climatology of the area and on the ground heat exchanger design and construction. As a result, the ground heat exchanger length required for heating may result significantly different from the one required for cooling. In this work, the ground heat exchanger lengths required for heating and cooling are calculated for two model-buildings, a residential and an office one, located at 40 different Greek cities, covering a wide range of country's climate conditions. Assuming that a ratio of these lengths in the 0. 8 - 1. 2 range is required for efficient long-term operation of the autonomous GSHP system with minimum installation cost, the results suggest that autonomous systems may be used in areas with the <b>heating</b> <b>degree-days</b> in the 800 - 950 Â K-days range.

As national inventory reports provide estimates at only a country or regional level, we have developed a new GIS approach that increases the resolution of emission inventories.

40|$|The Florida manatee (Trichechus manatus latirostris), a {{subspecies}} of the West Indian manatee, {{is one of}} {{the most}} endangered marine mammals in United States waters. The Florida manatee is the only manatee that ranges into subtropical and temperate regions. During the winter months manatees adopt a “refuging strategy” where they aggregate at warm-water sources immediately following decreases in the ambient water temperature to below 20 ° C (68 ° F) in order to avoid cold stress syndrome (CSS). During the winter manatees aggregate in warm water refuges, including natural warm water springs and the effluent discharges of power plants. The purpose of this study was to determine the number of manatees that aggregate and utilize the waters of the Florida Power and Light (FPL) Plant in Port Everglades (PPE), Florida, its effluent canal, and the surrounding Intracoastal Waterway during the winter months. This study documents the importance of Port Everglades as a wintering refuge for the Florida manatee. This study analyzed the inverse relationship between the number of manatees present at a warm water effluent and water temperature. In this study data were collected over five manatee winter seasons (between 15 November and 31 March) from 1999 - 2004, from both boat-based and land-based surveys monitoring the presence of manatees in the effluent canal from the FPL electricity generating facility in Port Everglades, FL and the Intracoastal Waterway.

The duration of these episodes was unusually long, with each lasting more than 1 month: 55 days for the warm anomaly of October–December 2002 and 37 days for the cold anomaly of February–March 2007. Temperature departures over each respective period were the largest for the continental climate of interior Alaska (. 108 C) and the smallest for the maritime regions of Alaska (, 48 C).

The combined model is evaluated with measurements from an urban neighborhood in Basel, Switzerland, {{and the importance of}} surface–atmosphere model coupling is demonstrated. Impacts of extensive albedo increases in two Chicago, Illinois, neighborhoods are modeled. Clear-sky summertime reductions of diurnal maximum air temperature for the residential neighborhood (λp = 0. 33) are − 1. 1 °, − 1. 5 °, and − 3. 6 °C for uniform roof albedo increases of 0. 19, 0. 26, and 0. 59, respectively; reductions are about 40 % larger for the downtown core (λp = 0. 53). Realistic impacts will be smaller because the 1 D modeling approach ignores advection; a lake-breeze scenario is modeled and temperature reductions decline by 80 %. Assuming no advection, the analysis is extended to seasonal and annual time scales in the residential neighborhood. Yearly average temperature decreases for a 0. 59 roof albedo increase are about − 1 °C, with summer (winter) reductions about 60 % larger (smaller). Annual cooling degree-day decreases are approximately offset by <b>heating</b> <b>degree-day</b> increases and the frequency of very hot days is reduced. Despite the variability of modeling approaches and scenarios in the literature, a consistent range of air temperature sensitivity to albedo is emerging; a 0. 10 average increase in neighborhood albedo (a 0. 40 roof albedo increase for λp = 0. 25) generates a diurnal maximum air temperature reduction of approximately 0. 5 °C for “ideal” conditions, that is, a typical clear-sky midlatitude summer day...|$|R

In order to better understand the effectiveness of cool roof technologies in a future that is expected to become increasingly warmer, data collected from weather stations near each DOE site were used to interpret the potential influences of weather patterns on cool roof energy savings. This research confirmed that cool roofs do reduce energy consumption, especially at sites with warmer summers and milder winters. Regression analyses of energy consumption and temperature data were conducted to identify associations between air temperatures and <b>heating</b> and cooling <b>degree-days</b> with seasonal energy consumption.

An archetypal load profile for a rural health clinic (25 kWhe/day and 118 – 139 kWht) is described, and a regional analysis is performed for sub-Saharan Africa by aggregating NASA meteorological data (insolation, temperature, and <b>heating</b> and cooling <b>degree-days)</b> using correlates to latitude. As a baseline for comparison, the technical, economic (using discounted cash flow) and environmental aspects of traditional electrification approaches, namely photovoltaic (PV) systems and diesel generators, are quantified, and options for meeting heating and cooling loads (e. g. gas-fired heaters, absorption chillers, or solar water heaters) are evaluated alongside an emerging micro-concentrating solar power (-CSP) technology featuring a solar thermal organic Rankine cycle (ORC). Photovoltaics hybridized with LPG/Propane and -CSP trigeneration are the lowest cost alternatives for satisfying important but often overlooked thermal requirements, with cost advantages for CSP depending on latitudinal variation in insolation and thermal parameters. For a 15 -year project lifetime, the net present cost for meeting clinic energy needs varied from 45 to 75 k USD, with specific levelized electricity costs of 0. 26 – 0. 31 USD/kWh. In comparison, diesel generation of electricity is both costly (> 1 USD/kWh) and polluting (94 tons CO 2 per site over 15 years), while LPG/Propane based heating and cooling emits 160 – 400 tons CO 2 depending on ambient conditions. The comparative analysis of available technologies indicates that where the energy demand includes a mixture of electrical and thermal loads, as in typical health and education outposts, on-carbon emitting -CSP trigeneration approaches can be cost-effective.

40|$|The global {{increase}} of temperature, together with more frequent severe winters and summer heat waves {{may lead to}} a change in energy consumption and agricultural production. Cooling, <b>heating,</b> and growing <b>degree-days</b> (CDD, HDD, and GDD), respectively, are used to quantify the energy needed to condition or heat buildings, and to study the growing season. Using a new dataset made of 4023 daily TN –TM–TX series for the period 2001 – 2011 and 3897 monthly TM homogenized series for the period 1951 – 2011, we computed CDD, HDD, GDD, and Winkler Index (WI) for Europe. We developed a model that correlates degree-days calculated with daily TN –TM–TX data with degree-days obtained by monthly TM data, in the overlapping period 2001 – 2011. A set of parameters for each station was then applied to the corresponding 1951 – 2011 monthly records. We interpolated the parameters and the reconstructed degree-day series onto a European 0. 25 ∘ × 0. 25 ∘ grid: with these gridded parameters, one can estimate the degree-days for any European location if only monthly TM is available. We present maps of HDD, CDD, GDD, and WI for the period 1951 – 2010. To validate them, we run a comparison in the Carpathian area using an independent dataset (from the CARPATCLIM project). The regional records show high correlations, especially for HDD (r > 0. 99) andWI (r > 0. 98). Subsequently, we performed a linear trend analysis on European and regional basis. HDD showed a significant decrease almost everywhere in Europe, whereas CDD, GDD, and WI showed a significant increase in particular in the last 30 years in the Mediterranean region. Moreover, WI indicated that new areas in France and central Europe became suitable for grape cultivation in the last decades. JRC. H. 7 -Climate Risk Managemen...|$|R
40|$|The use of time-of-day (TOD) pricing as a load {{management}} tool for electric utilities has recently gained wide interest. Although utilities have successfully used TOD pricing for some industrial customers, its applicability {{in the residential}} sector is untested. The Federal Energy Administration (and now the Department of Energy) has funded several experiments to test the implications of TOD pricing for residential customers. The major objective {{of this study is}} to analyze the Arizona TOD pricing experiment. Data from the first six months of the experiment had been analyzed previously in several different studies. Summaries of their methodologies and results are presented in Chapter 1. Many of these earlier analyses were unable to identify significant TOD price responses. A major deficiency in all was their failure to account properly for participation incentive payments. Consequently, meaningful inferences regarding residential responses to TOD prices cannot be drawn from these misspecified models. Chapter 2 contains a description of the experiment and the data is generated. The basic observation is monthly kilowatt hours consumed by each household in three time periods. Special attention is given to the derivation of the incentive payment inherent in the experimental design. This payment depends on experimental rates and patterns of pre-experimental usage. Specific adjustments to the data are required due to variations in billing cycle lengths and days. Details of these procedures and information on how the samples were edited are discussed in Chapter 3. The conclusion of this chapter presents data which reveal that households did significantly shift consumption from high to low cost periods. Chapter 4 contains a description of the hypothesized models and statistical methodology. Since this study focuses on household responses to TOD prices while controlling for impacts of experimental design, theoretically derived models are not tested. Income, TOD prices, <b>heating</b> or cooling <b>degree-days,</b> the electricity-using capacity of the households' appliance stocks, and incentive payments are the major determinants of consumption investigated. Ordinary least squares techniques are used to estimate TOD demand models for each month, for the summers of 1976 and 1977, and for the winter of 1976 / 77. Since the experimental design was modified in May, 1977, an analysis of covariance was done to test for structural changes. The results presented in Chapter 5 emphasize the importance of including the incentive payment in the TOD models. Without this term, no TOD price is significant. With it, TOD prices and the other independent variables are shown to be significant determinants of consumption. Statistical results are very impressive for the models estimated from the 18 months of cross-sectional data. Since the incentive payments depended partially on the rates to which customers were assigned, calculation of price elasticities had to be modified accordingly. Simple elasticities measured price responses which ignored the impact of the incentive payment. Since the incentive did not depend on experimental usage, it is the appropriate measure of household responses to TOD prices. Total price elasticities are used to measure TOD price responses under the specific Arizona experimental environment. A number of important conclusions are discussed in Chapter 6. The most important deal with the treatment of the incentive payment. When it is properly modeled, meaningful price coefficients can be estimated. Also, the results strongly suggest that households earmarked this payment for electricity purchases. Partial derivatives of the incentive were much larger than those for income. Misleading billing information may have produced this unexpected result. In May, 1978, billing procedures were improved. An analysis of these data should shed more light on this important matter...|$|R
