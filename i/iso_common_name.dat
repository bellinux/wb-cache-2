40|$|Triafamone (approved <b>ISO</b> <b>common</b> <b>name)</b> {{is a new}} sulfonanilide {{herbicide}} {{discovered and}} developed by Bayer CropScience AG under the code number AE 1887196. Its mode of action is inhibition of the enzyme acetolactate synthase (ALS). Field trials since 2007 have shown that triafamone can be effectively used in direct seeded or transplanted rice from seeding or transplanting to late post-emergence at rates of 20 to 50 g a. i. /ha using spray or granular formulations. Target weeds are important grasses such as Echinochloa crus-galli, Echinochloa colonum, Echinochloa oryzicola, Paspalum distichum, Isachne globosa, and sedges (including ALS resistant strains). The selective weed control spectrum is further extended in several co-formulation products being developed by Bayer CropScience AG. Environmental fate, ecotoxicology and toxicology studies indicate that triafamone has a favorable user, consumer and environmental profile. First registrations are expected i...|$|E

5000|$|However these <b>common</b> <b>names</b> {{appear to}} be in use {{exclusively}} in Western Australia, as the two species of Adenanthos that occur outside Western Australia are both woollybushes, yet have <b>common</b> <b>names</b> based on the term gland flower, which is also used in the <b>common</b> <b>name</b> of A. barbiger (hairy glandflower), a Western Australia jugflower species.|$|R
