500|$|The video {{begins with}} a girl (a young Underwood) {{studying}} at home. Her abusive father arrives and asks her if she needs help. She declines his offer and starts gathering her things to leave the room, however; as she stands up, he grabs her arm. She manages to pull away and leave. Underwood stated that this scene had no script. She and the actor acted it out the way they thought it might have happened. Underwood revealed that she left the filming location with bruises on her arm- [...] "I had <b>finger</b> <b>marks</b> on my arm when I left {{at the end of}} the day, so I was like, 'Wow.' ... It was intense. I wasn't just imagining it, it was really intense." [...] As the video continues, the girl is seen standing in the middle of a cemetery, walking around and staring at the clouds as a thunderstorm forms in the sky. She runs back to her house through an old, destroyed yellow-brick road, similar to the one of Wizard of Oz. She enters the house to see her father sleeping on the couch, holding a bottle of alcohol. She sits next to him, recalling the times he let his drunkenness and anger get out of hand. She tries to wake him up but fails. She realizes that he has passed out. She looks through the window and notices the thunderstorm getting worse, so she leaves her father and runs to the cellar alone to protect herself. She's seen lying in an old bed and crying, as she hears the tornado coming closer, with her father still passed out. The next day, there are no traces of the house, and she calmly walks away.|$|E
2500|$|In April 1906 it was {{reported}} that a watchman who had been the watchman on Telephone No. 3 for two years was believed to have been drowned. [...] On April 26, 1906 the body of the watchman, William B. Flannigan, was found not far from the steamer. [...] It was surmised from <b>finger</b> <b>marks</b> on the boat's railing that Flannigan had fallen into the river when trying to board the Telephone by climbing over the railing rather than using the gangway.|$|E
60|$|An {{index to}} {{each set of}} <b>finger</b> <b>marks</b> made by the same person, is needful in almost every kind of inquiry, whether it be for {{descriptive}} purposes, for investigations into race and heredity, or into questions of symmetry and correlation. It is essential to possess an index to the <b>finger</b> <b>marks</b> of known criminals before the method of finger prints can be utilised as an organised means of detection.|$|E

60|$|So Wilson mooned around, thinking, thinking, guessing, guessing, day and night, and {{arriving}} nowhere. Whenever he {{ran across}} a girl {{or a woman}} he was not acquainted with, he got her fingerprints, on one pretext or another; and they always cost him a sigh when he got home, for they never tallied with the <b>finger</b> <b>marks</b> on the knife handle.|$|E

5000|$|In October 1972, Mark was {{involved}} in an accident in Hawaii and lost most of his left-hand ring <b>finger.</b> <b>Mark</b> was quoted later in Melody Maker as [...] "climbed like a native and fell like an Englishman".

60|$|Differences between finger {{prints of}} {{different}} classes might {{continue to exist}} although those of different races are inconspicuous, because every race contains men of various temperaments and faculties, and we cannot tell, except by observation, whether any of these are correlated with the <b>finger</b> <b>marks.</b> Several different classes have been examined both by Mr. Collins and myself. The ordinary laboratory work supplies finger prints of persons of much culture, and of many students both in the Art and in the Science schools. I took {{a large number of}} prints from the worst idiots in the London district, through the obliging assistance of Dr. Fletcher Beech, of the Darenth Asylum; my collections made at Board Schools are numerous, and I have one of field labourers in Dorsetshire and Somersetshire. But there is no notable difference in any of them. For example; the measurements of the ridge-interval gave the same results in the art-students and in the science-students, and I have prints of eminent thinkers and of eminent statesmen that can be matched by those of congenital idiots.[5] No indications of temperament, character, or ability {{are to be found in}} <b>finger</b> <b>marks,</b> so far as I have been able to discover.|$|E
60|$|My {{attention}} was first {{drawn to the}} ridges in 1888 when preparing a lecture on Personal Identification for the Royal Institution, which had for its principal object {{an account of the}} anthropometric method of Bertillon, then newly introduced into the prison administration of France. Wishing to treat the subject generally, and having a vague knowledge of the value sometimes assigned to <b>finger</b> <b>marks,</b> I made inquiries, and was surprised to find, both how much had been done, and how much there remained to do, before establishing their theoretical value and practical utility.|$|E
6000|$|Poor Mary! how {{glad she}} was to see her boy again--most of all, that they could talk {{together}} of their lost one! How they discoursed for hours about her! How they cried together over the little faded bonnet, that once could scarce be kept {{for a moment on}} the busy, curly head! How they treasured, as relics, the small <b>finger</b> <b>marks</b> on the doors, and consecrated with sacred care even the traces of her merry mischief about the cottage, and never tired of telling over to each other, with smiles and tears, the record of the past gleesome pranks! ...|$|E

60|$|There was {{a certain}} eagerness in the young man's voice that caused Mark to watch him closely. He was a good looking young fellow, but his face was not a strong one; and {{although}} he evidently tried to assume an appearance of indifference as he sat down, there was a nervous movement of his <b>fingers.</b> <b>Mark</b> took his place behind him as play began. The game was ecarte, {{and for a time}} Emerson lost.|$|R
6000|$|... "It whizzed {{the poor}} babe dead. He was {{seated on a}} cheese of wads at the time, and after the dust of the pow-dered bulwarks had blown away, I noticed he yet sat still, his eyes wide open. 'My little hero!' cried I, and I clapped him on the back; but he fell on his face at my feet. I touched his heart, and found he was dead. There was not a little <b>finger</b> <b>mark</b> on him." ...|$|R
60|$|Leaving {{aside the}} Randoms that exceed 0 but {{are less than}} 1, there are {{nineteen}} {{cases in which the}} Random may be compared with the Observed values; in all but two of these the Observed are the highest, and in these two the Random exceed the Observed by only trifling amounts, namely, 5·18 Random against 5·00 Observed; 1·87 Random against 1·00 Observed. It is impossible, therefore, to doubt from the steady way in which the Observed values overtop the Randoms, that there is a greater average likeness in the <b>finger</b> <b>marks</b> of two brothers, than in those of two persons taken at hazard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now then," [...] said Wilson, [...] "I {{have here}} the natal autographs {{of the two}} children--thrown up to ten times the natural size by the pantograph, so that anyone who can see at all can tell the {{markings}} apart at a glance. We will call the children A and B. Here are A's <b>finger</b> <b>marks,</b> taken {{at the age of}} five months. Here they are again taken at seven months. [Tom started.] They are alike, you see. Here are B's at five months, and also at seven months. They, too, exactly copy each other, but the patterns are quite different from A's, you observe. I shall refer to these again presently, but we will turn them face down now.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have studied}} {{some of these}} {{signatures}} so much that I know {{them as well as}} the bank cashier knows the autograph of his oldest customer. While I turn my back now, I beg that several persons will be so good as to pass their fingers through their hair, and then press them upon one of the panes of the window near the jury, and that among them the accused may set THEIR <b>finger</b> <b>marks.</b> Also, I beg that these experimenters, or others, will set their fingers upon another pane, and add again the marks of the accused, but not placing them in the same order or relation to the other signatures as before--for, by one chance in a million, a person might happen upon the right marks by pure guesswork, ONCE, therefore I wish to be tested twice." ...|$|E
60|$|At last, when {{he reached}} the dark, calamitous {{building}} in which his madness had culminated, and found the black hallway, he dashed down it, perceiving no light or sound. But he raised his voice, hailing loudly; reckless of everything but that he should find the old mischief-maker with the eyes that looked too far away to see the disaster he had wrought. The door opened, and in the stream of light Father Rogan stood, his book in hand, with his <b>finger</b> <b>marking</b> the place.|$|R

50|$|In 710, Mont Tombe {{was renamed}} Mont Saint Michel au péril de la Mer ("Mount Saint Michael at the peril of the sea) after {{erecting}} an oratory to Saint Michael by bishop Saint Aubert of Avranches in 708. According to the legend, Aubert received, during his sleep, {{three times the}} order from Saint Michael to erect an oratory on the Mont Tombe. The archangel was reputed to have left his <b>finger</b> <b>mark</b> on Aubert's skull. This skull is displayed at the Saint-Gervais d'Avranches basilica with such a scar on it.|$|R
