40|$|AbstractAimTo {{evaluate}} {{the safety and}} efficacy of various initial strategies of loop diuretic administration in patients with acute decompensated heart failure (ADHF) on diuresis, renal function, electrolyte balance and clinical outcomes. MethodsConsecutive patients admitted with ADHF were randomized into three groups - intravenous furosemide infusion + intravenous dopamine, intravenous furosemide bolus in two divided doses and intravenous furosemide continuous infusion alone. At 48  h, the treating physician could adjust the diuretic strategy. Primary endpoint was negative fluid balance at 24  h after admission. Secondary end points were duration of hospital stay, negative fluid balance at 48, 72, 96  h, the trend of serum electrolytes, and renal function and 30 day clinical outcome (death and emergency department visits). ResultsOverall ninety patients (thirty in each group) {{were included in the}} study. There was a greater diuresis in first 24  h (p =  0. 002) and a shorter hospital stay (p =  0. 023) with the bolus group. There {{was no significant difference in}} renal function and serum sodium and serum potassium levels. There was no difference in the number of emergency department visits among the three groups.

40|$|AbstractHyponatremia often {{associates}} with heart failure. Although severe salt restriction is generally recommended in heart failure treatment, it may promote hyponatremia {{which is a}} risk factor for increased morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients. Therefore, it is not yet clear whether correction of hyponatremia is an effective treatment in congestive heart failure with hyponatremia. We experienced a successful case of refractory congestive heart failure with hyponatremia treated with hypertonic saline and furosemide. A 45 -year-old man, suffering from dilated cardiomyopathy, was admitted to our hospital for heart failure worsening with hyponatremia. We started <b>diuretics</b> <b>therapy</b> without correction of hyponatremia, but his clinical status of heart failure was not improved. Therefore, we additionally started to correct hyponatremia by continuous injection of hypertonic saline. The correction of hyponatremia increased urinary volume dramatically, and improved cardiac output and clinical status of heart failure. This case strongly suggests that combination of hypertonic saline and furosemide could enhance diuretic effect, and improve the clinical status of heart failure in congestive heart failure patients with hyponatremia. <Learning objective: Hyponatremia is a major problem associated with heart failure, but it is not yet clear whether correction of hyponatremia is an effective treatment in patients with congestive heart failure. We experienced a successful case of refractory congestive heart failure with hyponatremia treated with hypertonic saline and low dose furosemide. This case strongly suggests that aggressive correction of hyponatremia can be an effective treatment for refractory congestive heart failure with hyponatremia. ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractForty {{years ago}} therapy for {{congestive}} heart failure was limited largely to the mercurial diuretics {{and a variety of}} cardiac glycoside preparations; these were often ineffective, and the common practice of “pushing” digitalis caused serious, sometimes lethal side effects. Today, a more complete understanding of the regulation of cardiac work and pathophysiology of heart failure is having a profound impact on therapeutic strategy for this common condition. Despite more powerful means to augment myocardial contractility and much more effective <b>diuretics,</b> <b>therapy</b> that relies only on inotropic stimulation and diuresis is no longer optimal for the majority of patients with heart failure. Thus, strategies for the therapy of heart failure must take into account new understanding of mechanisms that initiate, perpetuate and exacerbate the hemodynamic and myocardial abnormalities in these patients. Recognition of the detrimental effects of excessive afterload and the importance of relaxation (lusitropic) as well as contraction (inotropic) abnormalities has led to widespread acceptance of vasodilator therapy, which has dramatically improved our ability to alleviate the symptoms of heart failure. Changes that result from altered gene expression in the hypertrophied myocardium of patients with {{congestive heart failure}} can give rise to a cardiomyopathy of overload that, although initially compensatory, may hasten death. These and other advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology, biochemistry and molecular biology of heart failure provide a basis for new therapeutic strategies that can slow the progressive myocardial damage that causes many of these patients to die, {{while at the same time}} improving well-being in patients with congestive heart failure...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{relation}} between preoperative left ventricular muscle mass and clinical {{outcome of the}} Fontan procedure was evaluated retrospectively in 22 patients with tricuspid atresia who were selected for this physiologic surgical correction by conventional hemodynamic criteria. Patients {{were divided into two}} groups: group A (excellent or good outcome) and group B (poor outcome or death) based on the clinical course assessed up to 9. 5 years postoperatively. Thirteen of 22 group A patients did not have prolonged, clinically significant, systemic venous hypertension and were not on long-term <b>diuretic</b> drug <b>therapy.</b> Nine of 22 group B patients either had clinically significant systemic venous hypertension, required long-term <b>diuretic</b> drug <b>therapy</b> or died (3 patients). Age at surgery, pulmonary arteriolar resistance, left ventricular ejection fraction, enddiastolic volume, end-diastolic pressure, systemic oxygen saturation and pulmonary to systemic blood flow ratio (Qp/Qs) were not statistically different between the two groups. Left ventricular muscle mass, both in group A patients (92 ± 31 g/m 2) and in group B patients (146 ± 61 g/m 2), was greater than the normal mean value (p < 0. 01 and p 0. 001, respectively). Left ventricular muscle mass in group B was significantly greater than in group A (p < 0. 01). Furthermore, left ventricular muscle mass/end-diastolic volume (mass/ volume) ratio, reflecting the extent of left ventricular hypertrophy relative to volume overload, was significantly greater in group B (1. 1 ± 0. 28) than in group A (0. 84 t 0. 21) (p < 0. 05). These findings are consistent with the observation that less satisfactory postoperative clinical outcome may, at least in part, be related to impaired diastolic function associated with inappropriately hypertrophied left ventricular myocardium. Determination of left ventricular muscle mass appears to be a useful variable to be considered along with conventional hemodynamic selection criteria for anticipating the clinical outcome in patients with tricuspid atresia considered as candidates for the Fontan procedure...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to review {{clinical}} studies on hypophosphatemia in pediatric intensive care unit patients with a view to verifying prevalence and risk factors associated with this disorder. We searched the computerized bibliographic databases Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, and LILACS to identify eligible studies. Search terms included critically ill, pediatric intensive care, trauma, sepsis, infectious diseases, malnutrition, inflammatory response, surgery, starvation, respiratory failure, <b>diuretic,</b> steroid, antiacid <b>therapy,</b> mechanical ventilation. The search period covered those clinical trials published from January 1990 to January 2004. Studies concerning endocrinological disorders, genetic syndromes, rickets, renal diseases, anorexia nervosa, alcohol abuse, and prematurity were not included in this review. Out of 27 studies retrieved, only 8 involved pediatric patients, and most of these were case reports. One clinical trial and one retrospective study were identified. The prevalence of hypophosphatemia exceeded 50 %.
