5000|$|The <b>controlled</b> <b>stop,</b> more {{commonly}} referred to as the [...] "emergency stop", is an exercise which determines the ability of the candidate to stop the vehicle promptly yet under control during a simulated emergency. The simulation is performed by the examiner raising his or her hand and saying, [...] "STOP!". A <b>controlled</b> <b>stop</b> exercise will be carried out on every extended test and one third of normal tests. This might be an emergency stop, or the candidate might be asked to make a <b>controlled</b> <b>stop</b> in a specific location. During dangerous weather conditions, such as rain and snow, this test can be left out for safety reasons.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} {{nonlinear}} robust controller for steam <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> in power systems. Based on dissipation theory, an innovative recursive design method {{is presented to}} construct the storage function of single machine infinite bus (SMIB) and multi-machine power systems. Furthermore, the nonlinear L 2 -gain disturbance attenuation control strategy is achieved for speed <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> of turbo-generators without requiring the solution of an HJI inequality. With multi-machine power system control, all the variables in the control law are only relevant to the state variables of the local generator, thus a decentralized control strategy is achieved. Simulation results of a 4 -machine system show that the controller can enhance power transient stability and dynamic performance. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Due to {{the differing}} {{electromechanical}} characteristics of modern variable speed wind turbines to conventional generators, {{the provision of}} ancillary services from wind generation is likely to {{change the nature of}} the frequency response of power systems to contingency events. This paper explores the aggregate contribution from wind turbines to the frequency response of future power systems, considering both emulated inertial and <b>governor</b> <b>controls.</b> In particular, the potential issues that may arise {{as a result of the}} changing nature of the system frequency response due to the uncertainty over the distribution of ancillary services from embedded generation on the network, are examined in the context of future power system requirements.

40|$|A novel {{nonlinear}} decentralized robust <b>governor</b> <b>control</b> for hydroturbine-generator sets in multi-machine {{power systems}} is suggested in this paper. The nonelastic water hammer effect and disturbances are {{considered in the}} modeling. The advanced differential geometry theory, nonlinear robust control theory and the dynamic feedback method are combined to solve the problem. The nonlinear decentralized robust control law for the speed governor of hydroturbine-generators has been derived. The input signals to the proposed controller are all local measurements and independent to the system parameters. The derived control law guarantees the integrated system stability with disturbance attenuation, which is significant to the real power system application. Computer tests on an 8 -machine, 36 -bus power system show clearly {{the effectiveness of the}} new control strategy in transient stability enhancement and disturbance attenuation. The computer test results based on the suggested controller are compared favorably with those based on the conventional linear <b>governor</b> <b>control.</b> © 2004 Elsevier Ltd.
