However, google.cn shows the Chinese frontier strictly according to Chinese claims with no <b>dotted</b> <b>lines</b> indicating the border with India and Pakistan. For example, the South Tibet region claimed by China but administered by India as {{a large part of}} Arunachal Pradesh is shown inside the Chinese frontier by google.cn, with Indian highways ending abruptly at the Chinese claim line.

25|$|The Wichita {{were known}} to tattoo their faces and bodies with solid and <b>dotted</b> <b>lines</b> and circles. They called {{themselves}} Kitikiti'sh / Kirikirish ("raccoon-eyed people") because of the tattooed marks around their eyes. They wore clothes made of tanned hides, which the women prepared and sewed. They often decorated their dresses in elk teeth. The kindred Pawnee called them Kírikuuruks / Kírikuruks ("bear-eyed people") and the Arikara Čirikuúnux (a reference to the Wichitas' tattoos). The Kiowa knew them as Thoe-Khoot ("tattoo faces").|$|E
50|$|In the {{adjacent}} image, the solid lines correspond to actual particles (of momentum p1 and so on), while the <b>dotted</b> <b>line</b> {{corresponds to a}} virtual particle carrying momentum k. For example, if the solid lines were to correspond to electrons interacting {{by means of the}} electromagnetic interaction, the <b>dotted</b> <b>line</b> would correspond to the exchange of a virtual photon. In the case of interacting nucleons, the <b>dotted</b> <b>line</b> would be a virtual pion. In the case of quarks interacting by means of the strong force, the <b>dotted</b> <b>line</b> would be a virtual gluon, and so on.|$|R

25|$|In optics, {{a virtual}} image {{is an image}} formed when the {{outgoing}} rays from a point on an object always diverge. The image appears to be located {{at the point of}} apparent divergence. Because the rays never really converge, a virtual image cannot be projected onto a screen. In diagrams of optical systems, virtual rays are conventionally represented by <b>dotted</b> <b>lines.</b> Virtual images are located by tracing the real rays that emerge from an optical device (lens, mirror, or some combination) backward to a perceived point of origin.|$|E
25|$|There is {{no single}} usage of segregation; {{in some cases it}} can mean the {{exclusion}} of motor vehicles and in other cases the exclusion of pedestrians as well. Thus, it includes bike lanes with solid painted lines but not lanes with <b>dotted</b> <b>lines</b> and advisory bike lanes where motor vehicles are allowed to encroach on the lane. It includes cycle tracks as physically distinct from the roadway and sidewalk (e.g. barriers, parking or bollards). And it includes bike paths in their own right of way exclusive to cycling. Paths which are shared with pedestrians and other non-motorized traffic are not considered segregated and are typically called shared use path, multi-use path in North America and shared-use footway in the UK.|$|E
25|$|The {{representations}} in (a–d) are trees, {{whereby the}} specific conventions employed in each tree vary. Solid lines are dependency edges and lightly <b>dotted</b> <b>lines</b> are projection lines. The {{only difference between}} tree (a) and tree (b) is that tree (a) employs the category class to label the nodes whereas tree (b) employs the words themselves as the node labels. Tree (c) is a reduced tree insofar as the string of words below and projection lines are deemed unnecessary and are hence omitted. Tree (d) abstracts away from linear order and reflects just hierarchical order. The arrow arcs in (e) are an alternative convention used to show dependencies and are favored by Word Grammar. The brackets in (f) are seldom used, but are nevertheless quite capable of reflecting the dependency hierarchy; dependents appear enclosed in more brackets than their heads. And finally, the indentations like those in (g) are another convention that is sometimes employed to indicate the hierarchy of words. Dependents are placed underneath their heads and indented. Like tree (d), the indentations in (g) abstract away from linear order.|$|E

25|$|In figure 2, the process-data {{diagram of}} the {{delivery}} phase within CCU is depicted. This way of modeling was invented by Saeki (2003). On the left side {{you can see the}} meta-process model and on the right side the meta-data model. The two models are linked to each other by the relationships visualized as <b>dotted</b> <b>lines.</b> The meta-data model (right side) shows the concepts involved in the process and how the concepts are related to each other. For instance it is visible that a package consists of multiple parts, being the: software package, system description, manual, and license and management information. The numbers between the relations indicate in what quantity the concepts are related. For example the “1..1” between package and software package means that a package has to contain at least 1 software package and at the most 1 software package. So in this case a package just has to contain 1 software package. On {{the left side of the}} picture the process-data model is depicted. This consists of all the activities within the delivery process. This article is based on this process-data model. The meta-process model (left side of the process-data diagram) is divided into several parts which are presented along with the corresponding paragraphs throughout the article to make it easier to understand.|$|E

500|$|In 1856, Scottish chemist Archibald Couper began {{research}} on the bromination of benzene at the laboratory of Charles Wurtz in Paris. [...] One month after Kekulé's second paper appeared, Couper's independent and largely identical theory of molecular structure was published. [...] He offered a very concrete idea of molecular structure, proposing that atoms joined to each other like modern-day Tinkertoys in specific three-dimensional structures. Couper {{was the first to}} use lines between atoms, in conjunction with the older method of using brackets, to represent bonds, and also postulated straight chains of atoms as the structures of some molecules, ring-shaped molecules of others, such as in tartaric acid and cyanuric acid.

Within the <b>dotted</b> <b>line</b> box in Fig. 4 c, the color of Ti changes from orange in interior to green in exterior. It can be inferred that the concentration of Ti 3 SiC 2 is decreasing gradually.
