5|$|Ion I. Agârbiceanu (1907–1971) was {{the author}} of {{pioneering}} work in spectroscopy, famed for his invention of a <b>gas</b> <b>laser.</b> Another one of the writers' sons was a surveyor. He and his family remained in possession of Agârbiceanu's large villa in Cluj, which was later declared a historic monument. The writer's grave was awarded the same status by Romania's Culture Ministry in 2012. Among the localities associated with Agârbiceanu's work, Bucium is home to a Fefeleaga Memorial House, a modern reconstruction which used Romanian folk houses as a blueprint; Sofia Danciu's actual home burned down in summer 2014.|$|E

Since then numerous other types of lasers have been constructed, like <b>gas</b> <b>lasers,</b> semiconductor lasers, dye lasers, chemical lasers and free-electron lasers (FELs). Each type possesses some unique characteristics, which make it particularly suitable for certain applications that cannot be realised by other lasers.

25|$|A <b>gas</b> <b>laser</b> is a laser {{in which}} an {{electric}} current is discharged through a gas to produce light. The first <b>gas</b> <b>laser,</b> the Helium-neon, was invented by William R. Bennett, Don Herriott, and Ali Javan in 1960. The first continuous visible <b>gas</b> <b>laser,</b> operating at 632.8nm in the red, was invented by A. D. White and J. D. Rigden in 1962.|$|E
25|$|Gas lasers, {{laser diodes}} and {{solid-state}} lasers can be manufactured to emit ultraviolet rays, and lasers are available which {{cover the entire}} UV range. The nitrogen <b>gas</b> <b>laser</b> uses electronic excitation of nitrogen molecules to emit a beam that is mostly UV. The strongest ultraviolet lines are at 337.1nm and 357.6.6nm, wavelength. Another type of high power <b>gas</b> <b>laser</b> is the excimer laser. They are widely used lasers emitting in ultraviolet and vacuum ultraviolet wavelength ranges. Presently, UV argon-fluoride (ArF) excimer lasers operating at 193nm are routinely used in integrated circuit production by photolithography. The current wavelength limit of production of coherent UV is about 126nm, characteristic of the Ar2* excimer laser.|$|E
25|$|Iranian {{scientists}} outside Iran {{have also}} made some major contributions to science. In 1960, Ali Javan co-invented the first <b>gas</b> <b>laser,</b> and fuzzy set theory was introduced by Lotfi A. Zadeh. Iranian cardiologist Tofigh Mussivand invented and developed the first artificial cardiac pump, the precursor of the artificial heart. Furthering research and treatment of diabetes, the HbA1c was discovered by Samuel Rahbar. Iranian physics is especially strong in string theory, with many papers being published in Iran. Iranian American string theorist Kamran Vafa proposed the Vafa–Witten theorem together with Edward Witten. In August 2014, Iranian mathematician Maryam Mirzakhani became the first woman, {{as well as the}} first Iranian, to receive the Fields Medal, the highest prize in mathematics.|$|E

Argon ion lasers can also operate in multi-line mode. Major disadvantage are high power consumption, generation of mechanical noise due to fan cooling and limited laser powers. Key suppliers are Coherent, CVI/Melles Griot, JDSU, Lasos, LTB and Newport/Spectra Physics.|$|R

2500|$|Faced {{with this}} {{enormous}} project, in 1989/90 National Academy of Sciences conducted a second {{review of the}} US ICF {{efforts on behalf of}} the US Congress. The report concluded that [...] "considering the extrapolations required in target physics and driver performance, as well as the likely $1billion cost, the committee believes that an LMF [...] is too large a step to take directly from the present program." [...] Their report suggested that the primary goal of the program in the short term should be resolving the various issues related to ignition, and that a full-scale LMF should not be attempted until these problems were resolved. The report was also critical of the <b>gas</b> <b>laser</b> experiments being carried out at LANL, and suggested they, and similar projects at other labs, be dropped. The report accepted the LASNEX numbers and continued to approve an approach with laser energy around 10MJ. Nevertheless, the authors were aware of the potential for higher energy requirements, and noted [...] "Indeed, if it did turn out that a 100-MJ driver were required for ignition and gain, one would have to rethink the entire approach to, and rationale for, ICF." ...|$|E
