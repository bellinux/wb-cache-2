40|$|In today’s research, smart {{textiles}} is {{an established}} topic in both electronics and the textile fields. The concept of producing microelectronics directly on a textile substrate {{is not a}} mere idea anymore and several research institutes are working on its realisation. Microelectronics like organic field effect transistor (OFET) can be manufactured with a layered architecture. The production techniques {{used for this purpose}} can also be applied on textile substrates. Besides gate, active and contact layers, the isolating or dielectric layer is of high importance in the OFET architecture. Therefore, generating a high quality dielectric layer that is of low roughness and insulating at the same time is one of the fundamental requirements in building microelectronics on textile surfaces. To evaluate its potential, we have studied polyimide as a dielectric layer, dip-coated onto copper-coated polyester filaments. Accordingly, the copper-coated polyester filament was dip-coated from a polyimide solution with two different solvents, 1 -methyl- 2 -pyrrolidone (NMP) and <b>dimethylformaldehyde.</b> A variety of dip-coating speeds, solution concentrations and solvent-solute combinations have been tested. Their effect {{on the quality of the}} layer was analysed through microscopy, leak current measurements and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Polyimide dip-coating with polyimide resin dissolved in NMP at a concentration of 15 w% in combination with a dip-coating speed of 50 mm/min led to the best results in electrical insulation and roughness. By optimising the dielectric layer’s properties, the way is paved for applying the subsequent semi-conductive layer. In further research, we will be working with the organic semiconductor material TIPS-Pentacen...|$|E
40|$|Trivalent {{lanthanide}} (Ln 3 +) -containing complexes have {{a number}} of important applications in molecular imaging, catalysis, medical diagnosis, information storage, and environmental sensing. The properties of Ln 3 +-containing complexes that are useful for these applications are influenced by coordination chemistry, including the number of coordinated ligands and ligand-exchange rates. The coordination numbers for water molecules bound to Eu 3 + and Tb 3 + have been studied by luminescence-decay measurements; however, the coordination numbers of other important oxygen-containing functional groups such as ketones, esters, ethers, sulfonyls, amides, phosphine oxides, and aldehydes have not been as thoroughly studied in solution {{because of the lack of}} hydroxyl groups that quench the luminescence of Eu 3 + or Tb 3 +. Therefore, there is a need to develop analytical methods to measure the coordination of different functional groups to Ln 3 + ions. This thesis describes efforts to measure the number of solvent molecules coordinated to Dy 3 + ions using 17 O-NMR spectroscopy in acetone, ethyl acetate, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylsulfonate, <b>dimethylformaldehyde,</b> di-isopropyl ketone, hexamethyl acetone and 4 -chlorobenzaldehyde. These solvents were selected because they contain a range of functional groups that have different electron-donating abilities and steric bulk. The measured coordination numbers were consistent with reasonable values, indicating that 17 O-NMR spectroscopy is a useful tool for measuring the coordination number of non-hydroxyl oxygen-containing ligands. In addition to coordination numbers of ligands, ligand-exchange rates are another important parameter that impacts the coordination chemistry of Ln 3 + ions. This thesis describes the study of water-exchange rates of Ln 3 + ions in room temperature ionic liquids. Room temperature ionic liquids were studied because they are important solvents for Ln 3 + ions. Luminescence-decay measurements were used to measure the coordination number of Eu 3 + and Tb 3 + ions in water/ 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium ethylsulfate (1 : 19, v/v), and variable-temperature 17 O-NMR spectroscopy was used to measure the water-exchange rates of Gd 3 +, Tb 3 +, Dy 3 +, Ho 3 +, and Er 3 + ions in water/ 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium ethylsulfate (1 : 19, v/v). Water-exchange rates increased with increasing charge density of Ln 3 + ions, except for Tb 3 +. This trend of water-exchange rates is opposite to the trend of Ln 3 + aqua ions, indicating that the change of solvents can manipulate ligand-exchange rates of Ln 3 + ions to the extreme case of inversing exchange-rate trends. For Tb 3 + ions, the fast water-exchange rate was attributed to the presence of a trace amount of Tb 4 + that was confirmed by X-ray absorption spectroscopy. These findings suggest variable-temperature 17 O-NMR spectroscopy is a useful technique to study the ligand-exchange rates of Ln 3 + ions in ionic liquids...|$|E
