The page consists of only two words: Liber generationis ("The book of the generation"). The lib of Liber is turned into a giant monogram which dominates the entire page. The er of Liber is presented as an interlaced ornament within the b of the lib monogram. Generationis is broken into three lines and contained within an elaborate frame in the right lower quadrant of the page. The entire assemblage is contained within an elaborate border.|$|E

Riley executed a second charge, silencing these too and taking their crews prisoner. His carrier was hit three times; for his actions Riley was awarded the Military Medal, the battalion's first <b>decoration</b> <b>of</b> the war.|$|E

5|$|The central Petén {{style of}} {{architecture}} is modelled {{after the great}} city of Tikal. The style is characterized by tall pyramids supporting a summit shrine adorned with a roof comb, and accessed by a single doorway. Additional features are the use of stela-altar pairings, and the <b>decoration</b> <b>of</b> architectural façades, lintels, and roof combs with relief sculptures of rulers and gods. One of the finest examples of Central Petén style architecture is Tikal Temple I. Examples of sites in the Central Petén style include Altun Ha, Calakmul, Holmul, Ixkun, Nakum, Naranjo, and Yaxhá.|$|E
5|$|The <b>decoration</b> <b>of</b> the {{elongated}} {{north and}} south walls includes brick blind arches in the bottom part and a large arch for each wall adjacent to the dome with a columned window in the middle. There are windows above the lower arches of the {{north and south}} facade. The dome, which also exhibits a large number of ornamental details and ceramics, features eight windows, one for each of its sides. The medieval frescoes which were painted on the interior walls of the church have been only fragmentarily preserved.|$|E
5|$|The decorations were in wood, stucco and stone, {{including}} marble, with geometrical and floral {{patterns and}} arabesques with Samarran and Byzantine origins. The decorations were {{more complex than}} the earlier Islamic forms and more carefully adapted to structural constraints. The imposing architecture and <b>decoration</b> <b>of</b> Fatimid buildings such as the al-Hakim mosque provided a backdrop that supported the dual role of the Fatimid caliph as both religious and political leader.|$|E
