And take some double chin drill. Your eyes are as vapid as the <b>glasseyes</b> of your stuffed fox. They have the dimensions of your other features, that's all. I'm not a triple screw propeller.|$|E
50|$|All <b>glasseyes</b> used to {{classified}} in {{a single}} species, Heteropriacanthus cruentatus, but recent morphological and genetic analysis indicates that <b>glasseyes</b> should be divided into three species: Heteropriacanthus cruentatus (Atlantic Ocean and southwest Indian Ocean), H. fulgens (northeastern Atlantic), and H. carolinus (Indo-Pacific).|$|E
50|$|<b>Glasseyes</b> {{or glass}} bigeyes (Heteropriacanthus) are a genus of the bigeye family {{found in all}} {{tropical}} seas around the world. It occasionally makes {{its way into the}} aquarium trade. It grows to a size of 50.7 cm in length.|$|E
5000|$|Their first U.S. {{national}} tour {{was billed as}} the [...] "Double Dipping Tour" [...] and took place in November 2006. They traveled with Reverend <b>Glasseye</b> and shared members between the two bands, hence the tour title. After this tour, Paul Dilley of Reverend <b>Glasseye</b> became a staple of HUMANWINE.|$|R

50|$|The {{species is}} named for Waigeo, an island in Indonesia; the common name is also spelled Waigeo or Weigeu seaperch. It {{is also known as}} the sand bass, sand perch, or <b>glasseye</b> perch. The generic name Psammoperca derives from the Greek ψάμμος (sand) and πέρκη (perch).|$|R
50|$|This {{fish can}} be found in the {{aquarium}} trade. It can be kept with other nocturnal fish, including pinecone fish, <b>glasseye</b> squirrelfish, and cardinalfish. This species requires plenty of hiding places and low lighting in the aquarium. Spawning of the related flashlightfish Photoblepharon palpebratum in an aquarium was observed by Meyer-Rochow in 1976.|$|R

40|$|Two new {{formations}} {{comprise the}} Nile Group; the lower Little Wanganui Formation {{and the upper}} Karamea Limestone. The Little Wanganui Formation contains the Kongahu Member (new name), <b>Glasseye</b> Mudstone (new name), and Kohaihai Limestone (new name). The Whaingaroan to late Duntroonian Kongahu Member consists of mass transported fossiliferous sandstones and conglomerates/breccias, which were derived from a landmass situated {{to the west of}} Kongahu Point. The member, which is largely confined to the coast between the Mokihinui and Little Wanganui Rivers, nonconformably overlies Paparoa Granite or is interbedded with the Kaiata Mudstone and (or) GlasseyeMudstone. The Whaingaroan-waitakian <b>Glasseye</b> Mudstone is an open marine calcareous detrital lutite, which is limited to the southern half of the study area. The Kohaihai Limestone is a shallow marine echinoderm biosparite, which conformably overlies the coaly Mawheranui Group in the Karamea region. The Karamea Limestone consists of the Stony Creek Limestone Member (new name) and the Oparara Member (new name). The Waitakian Stony Creek Limestone Member, a bryozoan biosparite, unconformably overlies the Kohaihai Limestone and the <b>Glasseye</b> Mudstone, or rests on Karamea Granite. The Oparara Member consists of calcareous very fine sandstone or fine-grained bryozoan biosparite; the member conformably overlies the Stony Creek Limestone in the Karamea region, unconformably overlies the <b>Glasseye</b> Mudstone elsewhere, and is conformably overlain by the Blue Bottom Group. The distribution of lithologies suggests that two sedimentary regimes operated in the study area during middle Tertiary time. The northern (Karamea) region was the site of a relatively stable, shallow, current swept, slowly subsiding carbonate shelf. The remainder of the study area was occupied by a rapidly subsiding marine basin (Little Wanganui basin), flanked on the west by a small rugged granitic landmass. Tectonic activity along the Paparoa Tectonic Zone during the late Eocene-middle Oligocene created an archipelago of islands with associated NNE trending basins; the most northerly of which constituted the Little Wanganui basin...|$|R

5000|$|H.A. Stevens - Harvey A. Stevens (d. 1894) {{began this}} factory in Weedsport, New York from 1880 to 1902. Harvey had several {{brothers}} that helped {{out at the}} shop, but George {{was the only one}} that would carve and paint decoys under his own label. So, the two brothers made commercial decoys and they made them during two time periods. First, the tackeye decoy made between 1870 and about 1890 and then the improved <b>glasseye</b> decoy made thereafter until George retired in the early 1900s. The Stevens brothers made two models, the standard decoy and the sleeper [...] "humpback" [...] decoy.|$|R
5000|$|They {{recorded}} {{their next}} release and first full-length album, Far Q, with Daniel Lancaster (of Hertfordshire band Proceed) at Studio <b>Glasseye</b> in Hatfield, England. It {{was released in}} March 2010 on A Wolf at Your Door Records in the UK, under the Distort Entertainment label in Canada and for rest of Europe under Redfield Records on limited Mediabook-CD and limited white vinyl. This release retained some element of the band's punk roots whilst gearing itself more towards post-hardcore/melodic hardcore influences.Before that Redfield Records release a 10" [...] split-vinyl in February 2010 with the single Far Q together with tracks from Grace.Will.Fall, Talk Radio Talk and MNMTS.|$|R
40|$|Based on {{a review}} of {{published}} and unpublished reports we analyzed Rapa Nui's (Easter Island) traditional and artisan fisheries. We include information from 2000 - 2009 on landings, species, fishing grounds, fleet and number of fisherfolks according to the Servicio Nacional de Pesca (SERNAPESCA) and personal communication with SERNAPESCA officials. Presently, 29 species of fishes and two invertebrates are fished (along {{with a group of}} species reported as "non-identified"), primarily from the 10 main fishing grounds within 5 nm from the shore. Sporadic fishing trips reach areas up to 25 nm offshore. Statistics about the artisan fleet and number of operative fishers is spotty and unreliable. In 2011 SERNAPESCA reported 123 artisan fishers and 31 boats for the island. Landings occur in five coves, of which Hanga Piko and Hanga Roa are the most important. Between 2000 - 2009 the mean annual landing ranged between 109 - 171 ton. The main exploited resources during this period were yellowfin tuna, snoek, Pacific rudderfin, rainbow runner, <b>glasseye,</b> oilfish, deep-water jack and swordfish. We highlight the urgent need to improve fisheries statistics (catch, effort, fishing grounds) in order to develop a science-fishery management and conservation plan, particularly linked with artisan fishery activities. Globally, we identify the need to integrate across fields (i. e., ecology, conservation, fisheries, education, outreach) more broadly in the national research system, to improve the management and conservation of Easter Island's unique marine environment. Within this framework, we identify an urgent need to create a research marine station on the island with permanent personnel, which can focus on this fragile oligotrophic ecosystem...|$|R
