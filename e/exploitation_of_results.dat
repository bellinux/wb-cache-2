The current legislation in the European Union and the United States gives special treatment to cooperation in R&D and the joint <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> (extended cooperation). We study several collusive regimes for a class of examples in which vertical relations are explicitly introduced. Regarding antitrust policy implications we fmd that: a) there is an ana-lytical justification to a 'rule of reason' treatment for extended cooperation in research joint ventures and, b) individual exemptions, though restrictive of competition, might be welfare improving.

The article follows the activities of the various research groups competing in the race to identify the genes and depicts the frequent conflicts between them.

40|$|Abstract:- Decision {{making in}} urban and {{regional}} development and management (URDeMa) issues {{is a difficult}} task to perform due to several constraints. The negotiation stage between the several parties involved in URDeMa decision-making is highlighted as a critical point for the whole process. Formal and informal processes and tools adopted for decision-making in URDeMa issues are reviewed to investigate their capabilities and limitations. The requirement for a computational tool that will assist at the high-level the decision-making process by facilitating the negotiations between stakeholders is identified. A conceptual framework {{for the development of}} a model that would support such a tool is presented in detail. Issues regarding input’s form and methodology of collection, theoretical context of the model’s operation, mode of implementation, and <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> are analysed.

This chapter describes and compares the main characteristics of SEAMLESS-IF and CAPRI, looking at objectives, concepts for database and model linking, modelling approaches at farm level and technology representation, agri-environmental indicators and baseline construction for forward looking impact assessment. Observed differences in these areas follow from SEAMLESS-IF focusing on field and farm level components stressing bio-economic interrelations and technological innovation, whereas CAPRI adopts a more market oriented perspective with full coverage of EU policies. Software design in SEAMLESS-IF is shaped by flexible component integration and a strong client oriented graphical user interface.

30|$|To answer our {{research}} question by proposing a model able {{to optimize the}} success of the university-industry technology transfer process, we put forward the vision of a university ideally seen like a hub, a crossroad of cultures, made of tacit and explicit knowledge, technology, and innovation, a link between training and local development, an institution that assumes the role of local development agent by facilitating the creation of knowledge and skills as well as economic value. This highlights the need for the scientific community to be supported by financial resources, both private and public, throughout the process of research and <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>results.</b> Since it is natural that research uses resources with a degree of risk, it becomes necessary that the technology developed can return the value used in the economic system, as only in this way can the process be virtuous.

40|$|Abstract. During {{the last}} few years, {{research}} and practice worldwide have shown that enhancing interoperability among organizations, systems or software applications is a multi-disciplinary issue of critical importance, touching upon processes, data and technical standardization. Fortunately, researchers and practitioners have started to realize the impact of interoperability in achieving true one-stop service provision for citizens and businesses, in fostering collaboration between enterprises or in minimizing the needed investment for maintaining complex systems. Current research results show that there exist common practices to be shared among public sector organisations and private sector enterprises, in attempts related with aligning organisation and processes, tackling semantic and technical shortcomings, building relevant architectures and finally achieving the legal interconnection and co-operation of systems. The identification of such common areas between eBusiness and eGovernment can then lead to a joint exploration, enhance reuse of the real paradigms and real <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> by enterprises and administrations. Also future interoperability research directions, as emerging from relevant strategies and research roadmaps of important stakeholders, and also from relevant research workshops, are outlined. Furthermore, {{it is argued that}} interoperability research should be extended towards ‘knowledge interoperability ’ as well, and deal with the development of methods and architectures enabling the exchange of knowledge among co-operating organizations...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this master’s thesis is to contribute to two main aspects of experimental tests on the behaviour of load-bearing masonry subjected to earthquake action carried out within the European research project SERIES. The first part explains the general context and presents the <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>results</b> of {{the first phase of}} SERIES project TA 5. This first phase investigates the response of four simple unreinforced clay masonry walls, two of them including acoustic insulation devices (SonicStrip). This phase has a double objective. On one hand, the tests aim at {{a better understanding of the}} seismic behaviour of single wall in dynamic conditions. On the other hand, the comparison between walls having a same global geometry, but with and without acoustic insulation devices allows the assessment of the consequences of the presence of that type of device on the seismic behaviour. The second part describes the design of specimens and the preliminary assessment of the structural behaviour of the second phase of the SERIES project TA 5. The design is focusing on the investigation of the behaviour of T- and L-shaped walls, and in particular on the role of the parts of the structural elements perpendicular to the earthquake direction, and on the characterization of the frame behaviour in such masonry structures. The structural assessment is carried out according to Eurocodes 6 and 8 and considers different loading situations that can be found in daily practice. Some preliminary information on the experimental results of the second phase of the SERIES project TA 5 are finally given. ...|$|E
40|$|Intelligent Industrial Processes {{is an area}} of {{excellence}} in research and innovation at Luleå University of Technology (LTU), which was formed to promote multi-disciplinary research and innovation relating to Process Industrial Automation, also referred to as ProcessIT. LTU has a strong track record of research in close collaboration with process industries, where research results have often found their way into products and services strengthening the industries position on the global market. For this area {{of excellence}} a road mapping study with respect to Automatic Control research was conducted and is summarized in this white paper. The study shows that current research activities in Automatic Control are very relevant to Intelligent Industrial Processes, dealing with techniques for process understanding (modeling), design and implementation of control systems, and process monitoring, only to mention some. It is concluded that the design and establishment of an Open Research and Innovation Platform is essential for collaborative and multi-disciplinary research in the area. Such a software platform will enable industry partners to more efficiently work with their industrial processes and that in close collaboration with researchers and engineering businesses. At the same time researchers and innovators {{will have the opportunity to}} test and validate their results and innovations on real-life cases, enabling a swift <b>exploitation</b> <b>of</b> <b>results.</b> Some key principles for this software platform are the open source, open data and open innovation principles that need to be captured in the platform.
