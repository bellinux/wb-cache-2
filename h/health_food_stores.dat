25|$|The {{legacy of}} the hippie {{movement}} continues to permeate Western society. In general, unmarried couples of all ages feel free to travel and live together without societal disapproval. Frankness regarding sexual matters has become more common, {{and the rights of}} homosexual, bisexual and transsexual people, as well as people who choose not to categorize themselves at all, have expanded. Religious and cultural diversity has gained greater acceptance. Co-operative business enterprises and creative community living arrangements are more accepted than before. Some of the little hippie <b>health</b> <b>food</b> <b>stores</b> of the 1960s and 1970s are now large-scale, profitable businesses, due to greater interest in natural foods, herbal remedies, vitamins and other nutritional supplements. Authors Stewart Brand and John Markoff argue that the development and popularization of personal computers and the Internet find one of their primary roots in the anti-authoritarian ethos promoted by hippie culture.|$|E
25|$|In the kitchen, tempeh {{is often}} {{prepared}} by cutting it into pieces, soaking in brine or salty sauce, and then frying. Cooked tempeh can be eaten alone, or used in chili, stir fries, soups, salads, sandwiches, and stews. Tempeh's complex flavor {{has been described}} as nutty, meaty, and mushroom-like. It freezes well, and is now commonly available in many western supermarkets, as well as in ethnic markets and <b>health</b> <b>food</b> <b>stores.</b> Tempeh performs well in a cheese grater, after which it may be used in the place of ground beef (as in tacos). When thin-sliced and deep-fried in oil, tempeh obtains a crisp golden crust while maintaining a soft interior—its sponge-like consistency makes it suitable for marinating. Dried tempeh (whether cooked or raw) is more portable and less perishable and may be used as a stew base. Sometimes when tempeh is diced and left, they will create white feathery fluff which bonds the cut—this is the Rhizopus mold still growing—this is normal and perfectly edible.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the first}} several decades of the 20th century, these beliefs were {{introduced}} to the United States as Germans settled around the country, some opening the first <b>health</b> <b>food</b> <b>stores.</b> [...] Many moved to Southern California, where they could practice an alternative lifestyle in a warm climate. In turn, young Americans adopted the beliefs and practices of the new immigrants. [...] One group, called the Nature Boys, who included William Pester, took to the California desert, raised organic food, and espoused a back-to-nature lifestyle. Eden ahbez, a member of this group, wrote a hit song, [...] "Nature Boy'", which was recorded in 1947 by Nat King Cole, popularizing the homegrown back-to-nature movement to mainstream America.

2500|$|The {{first signs}} of modern [...] "proto-hippies" [...] emerged in fin de siècle Europe. Between 1896 and 1908, a German youth {{movement}} arose as a countercultural reaction to the organized social and cultural clubs that centered around German folk music. Known as Der Wandervogel ("wandering bird"), the hippie movement opposed the formality of traditional German clubs, instead emphasizing amateur music and singing, creative dress, and communal outings involving hiking and camping. Inspired by the works of Friedrich Nietzsche, Goethe, Hermann Hesse, and Eduard Baltzer, Wandervogel attracted thousands of young Germans who rejected the rapid trend toward urbanization and yearned for the pagan, back-to-nature spiritual life of their ancestors. During the first several decades of the 20th century, Germans settled around the United States, bringing {{the values of the}} Wandervogel with them. Some opened the first <b>health</b> <b>food</b> <b>stores,</b> and many moved to southern California where they could practice an alternative lifestyle in a warm climate. Over time, young Americans adopted the beliefs and practices of the new immigrants. One group, called the [...] "Nature Boys", took to the California desert and raised organic food, espousing a back-to-nature lifestyle like the Wandervogel. Songwriter eden ahbez wrote a hit song called Nature Boy inspired by Robert Bootzin (Gypsy Boots), who helped popularize health-consciousness, yoga, and organic food in the United States.|$|E

2500|$|Their conference, set for Labor Day 1979, was to {{be called}} the [...] "Spiritual Conference for Radical Fairies",Harry Hay (1996) Radically Gay: Gay Liberation in the Words of its Founder, edited by Will Roscoe. with the term [...] "Radical Faerie" [...] having been coined by Hay. The term [...] "Radical" [...] was chosen to reflect both {{political}} extremity and the idea of [...] "root" [...] or [...] "essence", while the term [...] "Faerie" [...] was chosen in reference both to the immortal animistic spirits of European folklore and to the fact that [...] "fairy" [...] had become a pejorative slang term for gay men. Initially, Hay rejected the term [...] "movement" [...] when discussing the Radical Faeries, considering it to instead be a [...] "way of life" [...] for gay males, and he began referring to it as a [...] "not-movement". In organising the event, Hay handled the political issues, Burnside the logistics and mechanics, Kilhefner the budgetary and administrative side, and Walker {{was to be}} its spiritual leader.
