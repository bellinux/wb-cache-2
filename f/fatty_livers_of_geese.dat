Computed tomography was performed: there was no enlargement <b>of</b> the <b>liver</b> or spleen, but the attenuation value over the <b>liver</b> indicated appreciable <b>fatty</b> infiltration <b>of</b> the <b>liver,</b> establishing the diagnosis <b>of</b> acute <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy.

50|$|The {{most common}} form of the {{mutation}} is G1528C, in which the guanine at the 1528th position is changed to a cytosine. The gene mutation creates a protein deficiency that is associated with impaired oxidation of long-chain fatty acids that can lead to sudden infant death. Long-chain L-3-hydroxyacyl-coenzyme A dehydrogenase deficiency is associated with some pregnancy-specific disorders, including preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome (hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, low platelets), hyperemesis gravidarum, acute <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy, and maternal floor infarct of the placenta.

5000|$|Acute <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> <b>of</b> {{pregnancy}} {{is a rare}} condition and occurs in approximately one in 7,000 to one in 15,000 pregnancies. [...] The mortality from acute <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy has been reduced significantly to 18%, and is now related primarily to complications, particularly DIC (Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation) and infections. [...] After delivery, most mothers do well, as the stimulus for fatty acid overload is removed. The disease can recur in future pregnancies, with a calculated genetic chance of 25%; the actual rate is lower, however. [...] Mortality of the foetus has also diminished significantly, but still remains 23%, and {{may be related to}} the need for premature delivery.|$|R
5000|$|The {{understanding}} of the causes <b>of</b> acute <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy has been improved by advances in mitochondrial biochemistry. Deficiency of LCHAD (3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase) leads to an accumulation of medium and long chain fatty acids. When this occurs in the foetus, the unmetabolized fatty acids will re-enter the maternal circulation through the placenta, and overwhelm the beta-oxidation enzymes of the mother. [...] The gene responsible for LCHAD has been isolated, and the most common mutation found in acute <b>fatty</b> <b>liver</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy is the E474Q missense mutation. [...] LCHAD deficiency is autosomal recessive in inheritance and mothers are often found to be heterozygous for the affected mutation.|$|R
