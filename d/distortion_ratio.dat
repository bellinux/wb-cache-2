The modulation spectrogram {{is able to}} repre-sent redundant patterns across frequency with similar features, and the tensor factorisation is able to isolate these patterns in an unsupervised way. The method overcomes the limitation of conventional non-negative matrix factorisation algorithms to utilise the redundancy of sounds in frequency. In the proposed method, separated sounds are synthesised by filtering the mix-ture signal with a Wiener-like filter generated from the esti-mated tensor factors. The proposed method was compared to conventional algorithms in unsupervised separation of mixtures of speech and music.

40|$|We {{have shown}} {{previously}} that the progeny of crosses between heterozygous females and C 57 BL/ 6 males show transmission <b>ratio</b> <b>distortion</b> at the Om locus on mouse chromosome 11. This {{result has been}} replicated in several independent experiments. Here we show that the distortion maps to a single locus on chromosome 11, closely linked to Om, and that gene conversion is not implicated in {{the origin of this}} phenomenon. To further investigate the origin of the transmission <b>ratio</b> <b>distortion</b> we generated a test using the well-known effect of recombination on maternal meiotic drive. The genetic test presented here discriminates between unequal segregation of alleles during meiosis and lethality, based on the analysis of genotype at both the distorted locus and the centromere of the same chromosome. We used this test to determine the cause of the transmission <b>ratio</b> <b>distortion</b> observed at the Om locus. Our results indicate that transmission <b>ratio</b> <b>distortion</b> at Om is due to unequal segregation of alleles to the polar body at the second meiotic division.

40|$|It was {{recently}} {{shown that the}} symmetric multiple-description (MD) quadratic rate-distortion function for memoryless Gaussian sources and two descriptions {{can be achieved by}} dithered Delta-Sigma quantization combined with memoryless entropy coding. In this paper, we generalize this result to stationary (colored) Gaussian sources by combining noise shaping and source prediction. We first propose a new representation for the test channel that realizes the MD rate-distortion function of a Gaussian source, both in the white and in the colored source case. We then show that this test channel can be materialized by embedding two source prediction loops, one for each description, within a common noise shaping loop. While the noise shaping loop controls the tradeoff between the side and the central distortions, the role of prediction (like in differential pulse code modulation) is to extract the source innovations from the reconstruction at each of the side decoders, and thus reduce the coding rate. Finally, we show that this scheme achieves the MD rate-distortion function at all resolutions and all side-to-central <b>distortion</b> <b>ratios,</b> in the limit of high dimensional quantization. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a sub-Nyquist rate data ac-quisition front-end based on compressive sensing theory. The front-end randomizes a sparse input signal by mixing it with pseudo-random number sequences, followed by analog-to-digital converter sampling at sub-Nyquist rate. The signal is then recon-structed using an L 1 -based optimization algorithm that exploits the signal sparsity {{to reconstruct the}} signal with high fidelity. The reconstruction {{is based on a}} priori signal model information, such as a multi-tone frequency-sparse model which matches the input signal frequency support. Wideband multi-tone test signals with 4 % sparsity in 5 ~ 500 MHz band were used to experimentally verify the front-end performance. Single-tone and multi-tone tests show maximum signal to noise and <b>distortion</b> <b>ratios</b> of 40 dB and 30 dB, respectively, with an equivalent sampling rate of 1 GS/s.
