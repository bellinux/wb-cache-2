40|$|This three-month, single-blind {{clinical}} study compared two whitening treatments, at-home with 10 % carbamide peroxide and in-office with 35 % hydrogen peroxide, for {{the degree of}} color change of teeth, color relapse and tooth and <b>gum</b> <b>sensitivity.</b> The degree of color change and color relapse was evaluated by using a colorimeter, shade guide and color slide photography. Teeth and <b>gum</b> <b>sensitivity</b> were self-evaluated by the subjects, who recorded daily the tooth and <b>gum</b> <b>sensitivity</b> they experienced during the two weeks of treatment and one week post-treatment. A 14 -day at-home treatment was compared with 60 minutes of in-office treatment (two appointments, each with three 10 -minute applications). The at-home treatment produced significantly lighter teeth than the in-office treatment during all active-treatment periods and follow-up visits according to all three-color evaluation methods. Color relapse for both treatments stabilized by six weeks. At-home treatment resulted in statistically significant higher <b>gum</b> <b>sensitivity</b> than in-office treatment during {{the latter part of}} the first week. For tooth sensitivity there were no significant differences between the treatments. Eighty four percent of the subjects reported at-home treatment to be more effective and 16 % found no difference between the treatments. There were no subjects who reported the in-office treatment to be superior in tooth whitening to the at-home treatment. King Saud Universit...|$|E
50|$|The {{route of}} {{infection}} in most cases is from infected lower molars or from pericoronitis, which is an infection of the gums surrounding the partially erupted lower (usually third) molars. Although the widespread involvement seen in Ludwig's usually develops in immunocompromised persons, it can also develop in otherwise healthy individuals. Thus, {{it is very important}} to obtain dental consultation for lower-third molars at the first sign of any pain, bleeding from the <b>gums,</b> <b>sensitivity</b> to heat/cold or swelling at the angle of the jaw.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Evidence from Western {{countries}} {{indicates that}} there are fundamental discrepancies between self-perceived illness of immigrants {{and the provision of}} health care, according to the Western bio-medical health service model. These need to be understood in the planning and implementation stages of public health care programs for new immigrants. The objectives of the present study were to investigate self-perceived versus clinically diagnosed dental and periodontal health status among immigrants from Ethiopia. Methods During 2004 – 2005, dental and periodontal health status was recorded among 340 Ethiopian immigrants, utilizing the DMFT and CPI indices. Additionally, participants were interviewed using a questionnaire which included perceived dental and periodontal health status. Sensitivity and specificity levels of this perception were calculated and compared with the published scientific literature. Results Regarding dental caries, according to the three operational cut-off points, sensitivity ranged from 70 % to 81 %, and specificity ranged from 56 % to 67 %. Regarding periodontal status, 75 % of the subjects clinically diagnosed with periodontal pockets self-perceived a "bad" health status of <b>gums</b> (<b>sensitivity)</b> and 54 % of the subjects diagnosed without periodontal pockets, reported a "good" health status of gums (specificity). These indications of perception levels were higher than a previous study conducted among native born Israelis. Conclusion Minority ethnic groups should not be prejudicially regarded as less knowledgeable. This is illustrated by the unexpected high level of oral health status perception in the present population. Oral health promotion initiatives among immigrants should be based upon optimal descriptive data in order to accomplish the inherent social commitment to these diverse populations. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo compare {{oral hygiene}} {{practices}} and self-reported oral health problems among smoker and non-smoker male {{high school students}} in Dammam, Al-khobar and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia. Materials and methodsCross sectional study design was employed. The study sample (453) was calculated and participants were randomly selected from public high schools. Pilot tested questionnaire was distributed among participants of the study. Descriptive and analytical statistics generated using SPSS version 22. Statistical significance involved using a p-value of < 0. 05. ResultsThe prevalence of smoking among teenagers (15 – 19 years) was about 20. 2 %. Almost 61. 9 % (197) of non-smokers had excellent grades compared to 42 % (33) of smokers. About 64. 5 % (258) of the respondents used tooth brushing and 62. 5 % (244) used miswak and 23. 6 % (91) of them visited dentist for regular checkup. The comparison of oral hygiene practices between smokers and non-smokers revealed no statistically significant differences. Almost half of the teenagers had bleeding <b>gums</b> and tooth <b>sensitivity,</b> and were dissatisfied with the appearance of their teeth. Self-reported tooth sensitivity was higher among smokers (64 %) compared with non-smokers (43 %) (p-value 0. 001). Similarly, more smokers exhibited dryness of mouth than non-smokers and the difference was statistically significant (p-value 0. 007). ConclusionThere is high prevalence of smoking among adolescents. No significant differences were observed between smokers and non-smokers regarding oral hygiene practices. However, tooth sensitivity and dryness of mouth were more common in smokers than non-smokers. Smoking cessation programs should be introduced in schools...|$|R
