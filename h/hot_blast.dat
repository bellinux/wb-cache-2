5|$|The Monkland Canal was {{constructed}} {{at the end}} of the 18th century initially to transport coal to Glasgow from the rich local deposits. The invention of the <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> furnace process in 1828 meant that Coatbridge's ironstone deposits could be exploited to the maximum by the canal link and <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> process. The new advances meant that iron could be produced with two thirds less fuel. Summerlee Iron Works was one of the first iron works to use this technology. By the mid 19th century there were numerous <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> furnaces in operation in Coatbridge.|$|E
5|$|The tuyeres {{are used}} to {{implement}} a <b>hot</b> <b>blast,</b> {{which is used to}} increase the efficiency of the blast furnace. The <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> is directed into the furnace through water-cooled copper nozzles called tuyeres near the base. The <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> temperature can be from 900°C to 1300°C (1600°F to 2300°F) depending on the stove design and condition. The temperatures they deal with may be 2000°C to 2300°C (3600°F to 4200°F). Oil, tar, natural gas, powdered coal and oxygen can also be injected into the furnace at tuyere level to combine with the coke to release additional energy and increase the percentage of reducing gases present which is necessary to increase productivity.|$|E

5|$|Nittany Furnace, known earlier as Valentine Furnace, was a <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> iron furnace {{located in}} Spring Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States.

5|$|It {{was during}} {{the last years of}} the 18th century that the area {{developed}} from a loose collection of hamlets into the town of Coatbridge. The town's development and growth have been intimately connected with the technological advances of the industrial revolution, and in particular with the <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> process. Coatbridge was a major Scottish centre for iron works and coal mining during the 19th century and in this period was described as 'the industrial heartland of Scotland' and the 'Iron Burgh'.|$|E
5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{existed in}} China from about 1st century AD {{and in the}} West from the High Middle Ages. They spread from the region around Namur in Wallonia (Belgium) in the late 15th century, being introduced to England in 1491. The fuel used in these was invariably charcoal. The successful substitution of coke for charcoal is widely attributed to Abraham Darby in 1709. The efficiency of the process was further enhanced by the practice of preheating the combustion air (<b>hot</b> <b>blast),</b> patented by James Beaumont Neilson in 1828.|$|E
60|$|We walked our horses, trotted, loped, and {{repeated}} the order, over and over, hour by hour, mile after mile, under a sun that burned our faces and through choking dust.

That smooth red-branched and glistening green-leafed plant {{of the desert}} apparently flourished without rain. On all sides the evidences of extreme drought proved the year to be the dreaded anno seco of the Mexicans.|$|R
50|$|If the {{defrosting}} system melts all the ice {{before the}} timed defrosting period ends, then a small device (called a defrost limiter) {{acts like a}} thermostat and shuts off the heating element to prevent too large a temperature fluctuation, it also prevents <b>hot</b> <b>blasts</b> of air when the system starts again, should it finish defrosting early. On some early frost-free models, the defrost limiter also sends {{a signal to the}} defrost timer to start the compressor and fan as soon as it shuts off the heating element before the timed defrost cycle ends. When the defrost cycle is completed, the compressor and fan are allowed to cycle back on.|$|R

This scirocco has been modified in Egypt, at least during the spring, apparently by the planting of trees. About a quarter-century ago, its regular course was three days: on the first it set in; the second was its worst; and men knew that it would exhaust itself on the third. Now it often lasts only a single day, and even that short period has breaks.|$|R
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that blast furnaces, that convert raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron {{by means of a}} cold blast and <b>hot</b> <b>blast,</b> were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC). The bloomery was nonexistent in ancient China; however, the Han-era Chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a furnace and causing decarburization. Cast iron and pig iron could be converted into wrought iron and steel using a fining process.|$|E
5|$|From about 1790 {{textiles}} {{became the}} most important industry in the west of Scotland, especially the spinning and weaving of cotton, which flourished until in 1861 the American Civil War cut off the supplies of raw cotton. The industry never recovered, {{but by that time}} Scotland had developed heavy industries based on its coal and iron resources. The invention of the <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> for smelting iron (1828) revolutionised the Scottish iron industry. As a result, Scotland became a centre for engineering, shipbuilding and the production of locomotives. Toward the end of the 19th century, steel production largely replaced iron production.|$|E
5|$|In a {{blast furnace}} fuel (coke), ores, and flux (limestone) are {{continuously}} supplied {{through the top}} of the furnace, while a <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> of air (sometimes with oxygen enrichment) is blown into the lower section of the furnace through a series of pipes called tuyeres, so that the chemical reactions take place throughout the furnace as the material falls downward. The end products are usually molten metal and slag phases tapped from the bottom, and flue gases exiting from {{the top of the}} furnace. The downward flow of the ore and flux in contact with an upflow of hot, carbon monoxide-rich combustion gases is a countercurrent exchange and chemical reaction process.|$|E

The Kes 79 spectrum can be well fitted by a single NEI component, and the narrow-band images of that source show an inhomogeneous distribution of heavy elements. The heavy elements are richest in the positions S, SE and SW of Kes 79, where there may exist interaction between shocks and molecular clouds implied by radio observations. For W 49 B we present here the nonequilibrium ionization (NEI) analysis based on its emission line diagnostics, and the spectral fit using two NEI components. The reverse shock in W 49 B may be still hot and we don’t find evidence for a <b>hotter</b> <b>blast</b> wave in ASCA spectra. ...|$|R

40|$|Conditioned {{suppression}} is {{an animal}} model of anxiety disorders {{that has been}} broadly used to investigate the behavioral effects of different drugs. However, various methodological variables (e. g., the type of aversive stimulus) that supposedly interfere with the acquisition of conditioned suppression may also contribute to conflicting results among the studied drugs. Additionally, few studies have sought to investigate the effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). The present study investigated the effect of subchronic 5 -day administration of 5 mg/kg fluoxetine in the retention of conditioned suppression produced by a <b>hot</b> air <b>blast</b> (HAB). The subjects were 12 albino Wistar rats distributed into an Experimental Group (EG) and Control Group (CG). After sessions were conducted to pair two stimuli, a sound and HAB, fluoxetine (EG) or saline (CG) was administered. Twentyfour hours after the last injection, a test session was conducted. The results showed no difference between groups. Fluoxetine (5 mg/kg) did not exert anxiolytic effects in this model of conditioned suppression produced by a HAB.

5|$|Cupola furnace: American {{anthropologist}} Vincent C. Pigott of the University of Pennsylvania {{states that}} the cupola furnace existed in China at least by the Warring States period (403–221 BC), while Donald B. Wagner writes that some iron ore melted in the blast furnace may have been cast directly into molds, but most, if not all, iron smelted in the blast furnace during the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) was remelted in a cupola furnace; it was designed so that a cold blast injected at the bottom traveled through tuyere pipes across the top where the charge (i.e. of charcoal and scrap or pig iron) was dumped, the air becoming a <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> before reaching {{the bottom of the}} furnace where the iron was melted and then drained into appropriate molds for casting.|$|E
5|$|For a {{fortunate}} few though fortunes {{could be}} won 'with a rapidity only equalled by the princely gains {{of some of}} the adventurers who accompanied Pizarro to Peru', noted one observer. Among the most notable success stories were the six sons of Coatbridge farmer Alexander Baird. The Baird family had become involved in coal mining but opened an iron foundry in order to exploit the new <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> process of iron smelting invented by James Beaumont Neilson. The Baird's subsequently constructed numerous iron foundries in Coatbridge including the famous Gartsherrie iron works. The waste heap or 'bing' from the Baird's Gartsherrie works was said to be as large as the great pyramid in Egypt. One son, James Baird, was responsible for erecting sixteen blast-furnaces in Coatbridge between 1830 and 1842. Each of the six sons of Alexander Baird was reputed to have become a millionaire.|$|E
5|$|A {{blast furnace}} {{converts}} raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola furnace to produce cast iron. The earliest specimens of cast iron found in China date to the 5th century BC during the late Spring and Autumn period, yet the oldest discovered blast furnaces date to the 3rd century BCE and the majority date to the period after Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) established a government monopoly over the iron industry in 117 BCE (most of the discovered iron works sites built before this date were merely foundries which recast iron that had been smelt elsewhere). Iron ore smelted in blast furnaces during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the pig iron scraps were remelted in the cupola furnace to make cast iron. Cupola furnaces utilized a cold blast traveling through tuyere pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of charcoal and pig iron was introduced. The air traveling through the tuyere pipes thus became a <b>hot</b> <b>blast</b> once it reached {{the bottom of the}} furnace.|$|E
