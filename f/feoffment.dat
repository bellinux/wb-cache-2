25|$|Brian Cornwall died in 1391. The date is {{variously}} {{given as}} 5 May, and 18 August: the inquisition held at Standlake, Oxfordshire, in early September recorded {{it as the}} Friday after the Assumption and stated that John, his heir, was 24 and more years of age – the best evidence for his birth date. It noted that his estates in the county included the manor of Asthall-under-Wychwood, which was held in chief: this was a property that went back to Richard of Cornwall himself, who was granted it in 1227 by his brother, Henry III. There was also Idbury, held of the Earl of March. The inquisition taken at Bridgnorth the following day recorded the manor of Kinlet, also held of the Earl of March, as worth nothing beyond outgoings. It also listed various pieces {{of land in the}} vicinity of Kinlet, including a small estate at Catsley. At Leominster an inquisition recorded Brian's moiety of Ashton as held in joint <b>feoffment</b> with his wife Maud, who had survived him. The succession posed few legal issues and on 25 September the escheators were ordered to hand over to John Cornwall all his lands held in chief.|$|E
500|$|The Lord Chancellor had, {{since the}} 15th century, been tasked with {{administering}} estates where the estate {{was to be}} used for charitable purposes. In Bailiff of Burford v Lenthall, Lord Hardwicke suggested that the jurisdiction of the Court over charity matters came from its jurisdiction over trusts, {{as well as from the}} Charitable Uses Act 1601. Carne suggests that, as the Court had long been able to deal with such situations, the 1601 act was actually just the declaration of pre-existing custom. This is illustrated by the Chancellor's original jurisdiction over feoffments to uses, which came from his original status as a clergyman, as charity had been originally enforced by the Church and the ecclesiastical courts. Essentially, an owner of land could dispose of it by granting the right to use it and collect fees to another, not just by selling it. This was not valid at the common law courts but was in the Court of Chancery; the Lord Chancellor is reported as having said, in 1492, [...] "where there is no remedy at common law there may be good remedy in conscience, as, for example, by a <b>feoffment</b> upon confidence, the feoffor has no remedy by common law, and yet by conscience he has; and so, if the feoffee transfers to another who knows of this confidence, the feoffor, by means of a subpoena, will have his rights in this Court". After the reign of Edward IV, if the charitable land were to be sold (or land were to be sold to create the charity) the Court of Chancery was the only place this could be done, as ecclesiastical and probate courts did not have a valid jurisdiction.|$|E

50|$|At both <b>feoffments</b> George II of Great Britain {{swore that}} he would respect the {{existing}} privileges and constitutions of the Estates in Bremen-Verden and in Hadeln, thus confirming 400-year-old traditions of Estate participation in their governments. Being a Prince-Elector of the Holy Roman Empire and represented in its Diet {{by virtue of his}} Electorate of Hanover, George II Augustus didn't bother about Bremen-Verden's status of imperial estate. Since Bremen-Verden had turned Hanoverian, it never again sent its own representatives to a Diet.|$|R
50|$|Uses were {{equitable}} or beneficial {{interests in}} land. In early law {{a man could}} not dispose of his estate by will nor could religious houses acquire it. As a method of evading the common law, the practice arose of making <b>feoffments</b> to the use of, or upon trust for, persons other than those to whom the seisin or legal possession was delivered, to which the equitable jurisdiction of the chancellor gave effect. To remedy the abuses which it was said were occasioned by this evasion of the law the Statute of Uses of 1536 was passed. However it failed to accomplish its purpose. Out of this failure of the Statute of Uses arose the modern law of trusts (see that article for further details).|$|R

5000|$|The {{effect of}} the statute of Quia Emptores (1290) {{was to make the}} {{creation}} of manors henceforward impossible, inasmuch as it enacted [...] "that upon all sales and <b>feoffments</b> of land the feoffee shall hold the same, not of his immediate feoffor, but of the chief lord of the fee of whom such feoffor himself held it". The statute did not apply to a tenant-in-chief of the king, who might have alienated his land under a license. Accordingly, it is assumed that all existing manors are [...] "of a date prior to the statute of Quia Emptores except perhaps some which may have been created by the king's tenants-in-chief with license from the crown". When a great baron had granted out smaller manors to others, the seignory of the superior baron was frequently termed an honour.|$|R
5000|$|... ‘For the {{avoiding}} of feigned, covinous and fraudulent <b>feoffments,</b> gifts, grants, alienations, bonds, suits, {{judgments and}} executions, as well of lands and in tenements, as {{of goods and}} chattels, more commonly used and practised in these days than hath been seen or heard of heretofore; which <b>feoffments,</b> gifts, grants etc have been and are devised and contrived of malice, fraud, covin, collusion or guile to the end, purpose and intent to delay, hinder or defraud creditors and others of their just and lawful actions, suits, debts, etc; {{not only to the}} let or hindrance of the due course and execution of law and justice, but also to the overthrow of all true and plain dealing, bargaining and chevisance between man and man, without the which no commonwealth or civil societycan be maintained or continued.’ The original Fraudulent Conveyances Act 1571 The third action, which has operated since the Fraudulent Conveyances Act 1571, is that transactions entered into by a bankrupt are voidable if they would result in assets otherwise available to creditors becoming unduly depleted or particular creditors becoming unjustly enriched. Initially transactions made only with the intention of depriving creditors of assets, or perverting the priorities for order of distribution were vulnerable, while the modern approach of the Insolvency Act 1986 contains more provisions that unwind transactions simply because their effect is deprivation of assets available to creditors. Reminiscent of the 1571 Act, under the Insolvency Act 1986 section 423, a company may recover assets if they were paid away for [...] "significantly less than the value" [...] of the thing, and this was done [...] "for the purpose of" [...] prejudicing other creditors' interests. In Arbuthnot Leasing International Ltd v Havelet Leasing Ltd (No 2) Scott J held that the motive of the company or its directors was irrelevant, so that even though Havelet Leasing Ltd's lawyers had advised (quite wrongly) that their scheme of starting another company and transferring assets to it would be lawful, because the scheme's purpose was to put the assets out of other creditors' reach it breached section 423.|$|R
40|$|This thesis, {{which is}} based on manuscripts in Magdalen College, Oxford, is a study of the English career of Sir John Fastolf (1380 - 1459). In the first chapter Fastolf's {{investment}} in land is examined and the conclusion is reached that Fastolf bought property in a limited and artificial market. The second chapter analyses the administration of Fastolf's estates. It demonstrates that Fastolf paid close attention to administration and policy-making. A survey of Fastolf's friends and associates, particularly {{in the light of the}} <b>feoffments</b> he made, is undertaken in the third chapter. The subject of the fourth chapter is the emnity between Fastolf and William, Duke of Suffolk during the 1440 s. The high-handedness of the Duke and his officers is emphasised. The major lawsuits fought by Fastolf are studied in the final chapter. It is concluded that Fastolf suffered not because he had bought property unwisely but because he was the victim of the acquisitiveness of men who had political power during Suffolk's supremacy. Disputes, nevertheless, were almost always conducted in a peaceful way...|$|R

5000|$|In English law, <b>feoffment</b> was a {{transfer}} of land or property that gave the new holder the right to sell {{it as well as}} the right to pass it on to his heirs as an inheritance.

In feudal England a <b>feoffment</b> could only be made of a fee (or [...] "fief"), which is an estate in land, that is to say an ownership of rights over land, rather than ownership of the land itself, the only true owner of which was the monarch under his allodial title. Enfeoffment could be made of fees of various feudal tenures, such as fee-tail or fee-simple.|$|E

50|$|In the Middle Ages, the {{advantage}} of obtaining title to property through a fine (as opposed to, for example, a simple <b>feoffment</b> or deed of gift) was that it provided the transaction with the additional legal authority of a royal or court judgment, and ensured that {{a record of the}} conveyance would be preserved among the court archives.|$|E

50|$|In the Middle Ages, {{especially}} {{under the}} European feudal system, <b>feoffment</b> or enfeoffment was the deed {{by which a}} person was given land {{in exchange for a}} pledge of service.

50|$|<b>Feoffment</b> (constitutio feudi, infeudatio) {{involved}} the vassal being formally seized of his fief through a commendation ceremony.

He thereby symbolically received the protection of his new superior. From the end of the 9th century, this act was expanded to include an oath of allegiance, which was usually sworn on a religious relic. The oath served to affirm the binding of the liegeman to his liege, but emphasized that the vassal had not lost his status as a free knight, because only the free could be bound by oath.|$|E
