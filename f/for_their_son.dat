The {{proceedings}} of the trial were relayed in real-time by the court's official microblog account, though journalists covering the trial needed {{to belong to a}} pre-approved list.

Eve's desperation to conceal all evidence of her past relationship—and child—with Julian Crane leads to the breakup of her marriage and family, especially when her adoptive sister Liz Sanbourne arrives in the fictional Northeastern town of Harmony and ruins Eve's life for abandoning her first family.

25|$|In liberal circles, an {{idea was}} seriously {{discussed}} {{as to whether}} or not to force the King to abdicate, the Crown Prince renounce his rights to the throne, and instead have Augusta take up a regency <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>son.</b> Because the letters and diaries of that time were later destroyed by Augusta, it is not clear whether she seriously considered this option. After, in May 1848, 800 members of the German National Assembly met in the Frankfurter Paulskirche to discuss German unification and Prince William returned from London the following month. A year later, in 1849, he was appointed Governor-General of the Rhine Province and in the spring of 1850, he and Augusta took up residence in Koblenz.|$|E
