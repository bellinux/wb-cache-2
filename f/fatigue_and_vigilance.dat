40|$|In this {{vigilance}} {{research the}} effect of fatigue on driver’s voluntary reaction times (RT) and autonomic skin conductance (SC) was studied. Participants (n= 17) drove approximately 3 hours in a simulator responding simultaneously on a peripheral visual vigilance task (PVVT). RTs were classified into 5 quintiles according to their latency. Also misses and misclassifications were explored. Results indicated that RTs increased linearly over time. SC amplitudes differed significantly between RT quintiles. Vigilance performance was the best when arousals were frequent but their magnitude remained relatively low. Frequent and high amplitude arousals in turn {{were associated with the}} worst performance. Results suggest that autonomic SC and voluntary RT could be combined to reveal driver’s <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> <b>vigilance</b> performance more consistently than either measure alone...|$|E
40|$|According to {{statistics}} for 2003, 9 in 100, 000 people in Canada died from driving accidents. A high percentage (30 - 40 %) of these took place due to sleepiness on monotonous road conditions. Therefore, driver vigilance must be studied {{in order to}} attempt to decrease these fatal accidents. Thiffault and Bergeron (2003) have proposed a model for <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> <b>vigilance</b> which involves both endogenous and exogenous factors. In this framework, endogenous factors would include any fluctuation in alertness which originates from within the driver, such as circadian variations associated with the time of day, fatigue generated from the task itself, and sleep related problems that the individual may be suffering. Exogenous factors that influence driving vigilance are those which come from the task itself, such as road geometry and road-side environmental cues. The authors also suggest that mental under-load caused by such driving conditions could {{be as important as}} overload from urban expressway conditions...|$|E

40|$|Circadian rhythm sleep {{disorders}} (CRSDs) {{are related to}} alterations in circadian timekeeping system or misalignment between endogenous circadian rhythm and exogenous factors, such as desidered or socially required time schedules, that affect sleep timing or duration. The most commonly observed are jet lag disorder, advanced and delayed sleep phase disorder, free-running disorder, and irregular sleep-wake disorder. The clinical picture may include sleep loss, <b>fatigue,</b> cognitive <b>and</b> <b>vigilance</b> deterioration <b>and</b> hormonal and gastrointestinal distress.

40|$|International audienceDuring {{long and}} {{monotonous}} driving at night, most drivers progressively {{show signs of}} visual <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> loss of <b>vigilance.</b> Their capacity to maintain adequate driving performance usually is affected and varies with {{the age of the}} driver. The main question is to know, on one hand, if occurrence of <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> drowsiness is accompanied by a modification in the driving performance of the driver and, on the other hand, if this relationship partially depends on the driver's age. Forty-six male drivers, divided into three age categories: 20 - 30, 40 - 50, and 60 - 70 years, performed a 350 -km motorway driving session at night on a driving simulator. Driving errors were measured in terms of number of running-off-the-road incidents (RORI) and large speed deviations. The evolution of physiological vigilance level was evaluated using electroencephalography (EEG) recording. In older drivers, in comparison with young and middle-aged drivers, the degradation of driving performance was correlated to the evolution of lower frequency waking EEG (i. e., theta). Contrary to young and middle-aged drivers, the deterioration of the vigilance level attested by EEG correlated with the increase in gravity of all studied driving errors in older drivers. Thus, depending on the age category considered, only part of the driving errors would constitute a relevant indication as for the occurrence of a state of low arousal...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUNDDyspnea is {{the major}} source of {{disability}} in COPD. In COPD, environmental cues (eg, the prospect of having to climb stairs) become associated with dyspnea and may trigger dyspnea even before physical activity commences. We hypothesized that brain activation relating to such cues would be different between patients with COPD and healthy control subjects, reflecting greater engagement of emotional mechanisms in patients. METHODSUsing functional MRI (FMRI), we investigated brain responses to dyspnea-related word cues in 41 patients with COPD and 40 healthy age-matched control subjects. We combined these findings with scores on self-report questionnaires, thus linking the FMRI task with clinically relevant measures. This approach was adapted from studies in pain that enabled identification of brain networks responsible for pain processing despite absence of a physical challenge. RESULTSPatients with COPD demonstrated activation in the medial prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate cortex, which correlated with the visual analog scale (VAS) response to word cues. This activity independently correlated with patient responses on questionnaires of depression, fatigue, and dyspnea vigilance. Activation in the anterior insula, lateral prefrontal cortex, and precuneus correlated with the VAS dyspnea scale but not with the questionnaires. CONCLUSIONSThe findings suggest that engagement of the emotional circuitry of the brain is important for interpretation of dyspnea-related cues in COPD and is influenced by depression, <b>fatigue,</b> <b>and</b> <b>vigilance.</b> A heightened response to salient cues is associated with increased symptom perception in chronic pain and asthma, and the findings suggest that such mechanisms may be relevant in COPD...|$|E

40|$|Objective {{assessments}} of subjective complaints such as sleepiness, tiredness or <b>fatigue</b> using sleepiness <b>and</b> <b>vigilance</b> tests aim to identify its causes and {{to judge the}} fitness to drive or to work of the affected person. "Vigilance" comprises wakefulness, alertness and attention and is therefore not merely reciprocal to sleepiness. Since it is a complex phenomenon with several dimensions {{it is unlikely to}} be appropriately assessed by one single "vigilance test". One important dimension of vigilance discussed here is wakefulness with its counterpart of overt sleep and the whole spectrum of various levels in between. The transit zone between full wakefulness and overt sleep is mainly characterised by the subjective complaint of sleepiness, which cannot be measured directly. Only the consequences of reduced wakefulness such as a shortened sleep latency, slowed cognitive function and prolonged reaction time can be measured objectively. It is, therefore, more promising to combine a battery of subjective and objective tests to answer a specific question in order to achieve the most appropriate description for a given clinical or medicolegal situation. However even then we must keep in mind that many other important aspects of fitness to drive / fitness to work such as neurological, psychiatric and neuropsychological functions including risk taking behaviour are not covered by vigilance tests. A comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach is essential in such situations...|$|R
40|$|There {{were two}} major {{objectives}} for this thesis: 1) {{to integrate the}} existing literature based on <b>vigilance,</b> noise, <b>and</b> neuromuscular <b>fatigue</b> <b>and</b> 2) {{to determine the effects}} of muscle contraction intensity, neuromuscular <b>fatigue,</b> <b>and</b> noise on the performance of complex <b>and</b> simple <b>vigilance</b> tasks. Vigilance or an individual's state of physiological or psychological readiness to mediate performance when reacting to a stimulus can be affected simultaneously by noise and neuromuscular stimuli. Noise exposure and muscle contraction have been shown to both negatively <b>and</b> positively affect <b>vigilance</b> performance. However, this contradiction may be a result of differences in muscle contraction and noise intensities, durations, and type as well as the complexity of the vigilance task. It was determined in the present experiment that continuous noise at an intensity of 95 dB (A) impairs both simple and to a greater extent complex vigilance task performance. Isometric muscle contractions at 5 % and 20 % of a maximum voluntary contraction also impaired simple <b>and</b> complex <b>vigilance</b> task performance. There did not seem to be an interaction effect between noise and contraction intensity...|$|R
40|$|Mass {{transport}} {{has generally}} been recognized as a major limiting factor in the sensitivity and performance of miniaturized sensor platforms. To overcome this limitation, a new approach, termed molecular dam, has been developed to enhance mass transport for protein enrichment in nanofluidic channels by nanoscale electrodeless dielectrophoresis under physiological buffer conditions. We demonstrated protein enrichment factor to be greater than 105 -fold in 20 seconds, which is orders of magnitude faster than most reported methods. We also studied the detailed mechanism as how the electrokinetic forces get balanced to achieve the molecular damming effect and the scaling relation of force and nanoconstriction size. Both the capillary- and electrokinetically-driven nanoslit sensor platforms have also been developed in parallel to enhance the reaction kinetics of protein sensing by reducing the diffusion length of reactants. A methodology for the real-time assessment of a diverse set of performance biomarkers, which are indicators of <b>fatigue,</b> <b>vigilance,</b> <b>and</b> stress, is currently being undertaken by the 711 th Human Performance Wing at the Wright Patterson Air Force Base to assess the preparedness of its personnel for various missions.

In this work, we intensify the Poincaré analysis by dividing the distribution of HR data in different accelerating and decelerating segments and by establishing properties of asymmetry between these segments. We also show that most of the properties of long-term HRV correlate well with specific fatigue measures for a group of 5 volunteers despite their large inter-individual differences in HR-to-fatigue correlations...|$|R
