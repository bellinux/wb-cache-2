25|$|By the 16th century, the Christian Kingdom of Georgia {{had become}} {{fractured}} {{into a series}} of smaller states which were fought over by the two great Muslim empires in the region, Ottoman Turkey and Safavid Persia. But {{during the second half of}} the century a third imperial power emerged to the north, namely the Russian state of Muscovy, which shared Georgia's Orthodox religion. Diplomatic contacts between the Georgian Kingdom of Kakheti and Moscow began in 1558 and in 1589, Tsar Fyodor <b>I</b> <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> put the kingdom under his protection. Yet little help was forthcoming and the Russians were still too remote from the south Caucasus region to challenge Ottoman or Persian control and hegemony successfully. Only in the early 18th century did Russia start to make serious military inroads south of the Caucasus. In 1722, Peter the Great exploited the chaos and turmoil in the Safavid Persian Empire to lead an expedition against it, while he struck an alliance with Vakhtang VI, the Georgian ruler of Kartli and the Safavid-appointed governor of the region. However, the two armies failed to link up and the Russians retreated northward again, leaving the Georgians to the mercy of the Persians. Vakhtang ended his days in exile in Russia.|$|E
500|$|On March 25, 2008, Gravel {{announced}} that he would leave the Democrats and join the Libertarian Party, saying: [...] "My libertarian views, as well as my strong stance against war, the military industrial complex and American imperialism, seem not to be tolerated by Democratic Party elites who are {{out of touch with the}} average American; elites that reject the empowerment of American citizens <b>I</b> <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> the Democratic Party at the beginning of this presidential campaign with the National Initiative for Democracy." [...] The following day Gravel entered the race for the 2008 Libertarian presidential nomination, saying that he would have run as a third-party candidate all along except that he needed the public exposure that came from being in the earlier Democratic debates. Gravel's initial notion of running as a fusion candidate with other parties was met with skepticism and not pursued.|$|E
2500|$|MacDonald {{summarized}} what {{he considered}} {{the prospect of a}} fair representation by the SPLC's Beirich: [...] "Given Ms Beirich's poor record in accurately portraying my writings, I had no confidence that she would conduct and report on an interview with me in a non-biased way. Nevertheless, <b>I</b> <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> be interviewed by her if she would answer my concerns about her previous writing about me. She has not responded to this offer." [...] MacDonald specifically named six points which he demands Beirich address before he grants her an interview, in a series of emails between himself and her, published on his website.|$|E

2500|$|The studio {{publicity}} {{department was}} concerned audiences would confuse Granger with British actor Stewart Granger, so they suggested he change {{his name and}} offered him a list from which to choose. [...] "The names were all interchangeable, like Gordon Gregory and Gregory Gordon. I didn't want to change my name," [...] Granger later recalled. [...] "I liked Farley Granger. It was my father's name, and his grandfather's name. They kept bringing me new combinations, and finally <b>I</b> <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> change it to Kent Clark. I {{was the only one}} who thought it was funny." [...] Eventually the studio issued a press release announcing Farley Granger, a senior at North Hollywood High School, had been cast in The North Star after he responded to an ad in the local paper. [...] "I thought that was a really dumb story," [...] said Granger. [...] "The truth was much more interesting." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 826, the King of Jutland Harald Klak {{was forced}} to flee from Denmark by Horik I, Denmark's other king. [...] Harald went to Emperor Louis I of Germany to seek help getting his lands in Jutland back. Louis <b>I</b> <b>offered</b> <b>to</b> make Harald Duke of Frisia if he would give up the old gods. Harald agreed, and his family and the 400 Danes with him were baptized in Ingelheim am Rhein. When Harald {{returned}} to Jutland, Emperor Louis and Ebbo of Rheims assigned the monk Ansgar to accompany Harald and oversee Christianity among the converts. When Harald Klak was forced from Denmark by King Horik I again, Ansgar left Denmark and focused his efforts on the Swedes. Ansgar traveled to Birka in 829 and established a small Christian community there. His most important convert was Herigar, described as a prefect {{of the town and}} a counselor to the king. In 831 the Archdiocese of Hamburg was founded and assigned responsibility for proselytizing Scandinavia.|$|E
