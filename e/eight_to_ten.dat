Those schools which teach from years <b>eight</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> often have a wider catchment area. The size of institutions is widely varied. In the Reykjavík urban area, schools can be up to 1200 pupils in size. In rural areas, schools can have fewer than 10 pupils, and around 50% of schools have fewer than 100 pupils. All compulsory education institutions are mixed sex. Many counselling services are available, including help with studies and specific subjects; psychological counselling is also available.|$|E

Mine owned by PBS Coals in Stonycreek Township in Somerset County. The National Transportation Safety Board reported that the flight impacted at 563mph (906km/h, 252m/s, or 489 knots) at a 40-degree nose-down, inverted attitude. The impact left a crater <b>eight</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> feet deep (c. 3m), and 30 to 50 feet wide (c. 12m). All 44 people on board died. Many media reports and eyewitness accounts said {{the time of the}} crash was 10:06 or 10:10; an initial analysis of seismographic data in the area concluded that the crash occurred at 10:06, but the 9/11 Commission report states that this analysis was not definitive and was retracted. Other media outlets and the 9/11 Commission reported the time of impact as 10:03, based on when the flight recorders stopped, analysis of radar data, infrared satellite data, and air traffic control transmissions.|$|E

Overall height of the body was 10.5 metres (of which most was submerged), surmounted by a mast and extendible aerial of 9 metres. Data (air and water temperature, atmospheric pressure and relative humidity) were encoded and transmitted four times a day.

5|$|Illinois was {{released}} on July 4, 2005, through Rough Trade Records in Europe and was distributed domestically by Asthmatic Kitty Records starting July 5, 2005. Although he initially {{had no plans to}} perform this material live, less than two weeks after the release of Illinois, Stevens embarked on a North American tour to promote the album, performing with a string section of <b>eight</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> members named the Illinoisemakers. He deliberately chose to avoid television as a promotional tool and focused on the tour performances themselves. He was supported on some dates by opening acts Liz Janes (who is also signed to Asthmatic Kitty) and Laura Veirs as well as Illinois collaborator Shara Nova's solo project My Brightest Diamond. He toured in support of the album again from September through November 2006, this time including dates in several European cities. During the 2006 dates, Stevens and his band transitioned from wearing University of Illinois-themed outfits to butterfly suits and bird wings.|$|E
5|$|In {{neighboring}} {{areas of}} Russia {{there are significant}} numbers of Norway spruce, but they only exist sporadically within Øvre Pasvik, {{with no more than}} 40 trees in one place. The lack of spruce is caused by a combination of frost occurring as late as June, and wildfire. There is also a limited amount of birch, specifically dwarf birch and silver birch. Aspen is uncommon largely because its bark and roots are popular food for animals. Along some creeks there are bird cherry and grey alder. The area is too dry to allow the latter to grow away from creeks and lake sides. There are <b>eight</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> species of willow within the national park.|$|E

5|$|On February 10, 1825, Cofresí plundered the sloop Neptune. The {{merchant}} ship, with a {{cargo of}} fabric and provisions, was attacked while its dry goods were unloaded at dockside in Jobos Bay. Neptune {{was owned by}} Salvador Pastorisa, who was supervising the unloading. Cofresí began the charge in a sloop, opening musket fire on the crew, and Pastoriza fled in a rowboat. Despite a bullet wound, Pastoriza identified four of the <b>eight</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> pirates (including Cofresí). An Italian living in Puerto Rico, Pedro Salovi, was reportedly second-in-command during the attack. The pirates pursued and shot those who fled. Cofresí sailed Neptune out of Jobos Port, a harbor in Jobos Bay (near Fajardo), and adopted the sloop as a pirate ship.|$|E
5|$|Run privately for profit, as {{were all}} English prisons until the 19th century, the Marshalsea {{looked like an}} Oxbridge college and functioned as an {{extortion}} racket. Debtors in the 18th century who could afford the prison fees had access to a bar, shop and restaurant, and retained the crucial privilege of being allowed out during the day, which gave {{them a chance to}} earn money for their creditors. Everyone else was crammed into one of nine small rooms with dozens of others, possibly for years for the most modest of debts, which increased as unpaid prison fees accumulated. The poorest faced starvation and, if they crossed the jailers, torture with skullcaps and thumbscrews. A parliamentary committee reported in 1729 that 300inmates had starved to death within a three-month period, and that <b>eight</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> were dying every 24hours in the warmer weather.|$|E

50|$|The 4DD was {{somewhat}} unsuccessful because {{the upper level}} compartments were cramped and poorly ventilated (the upper level windows could not be opened due to tight clearance). The compartments were pressure-ventilated but the equipment proved to be troublesome. Dwell times at stations were lengthened because {{of the increase in}} the number of passengers per door. To obtain the extra seating capacity that was being sought, it was instead decided to lengthen trains from <b>eight</b> cars <b>to</b> <b>ten.</b>|$|R
5|$|The raw wound {{fabric of}} silk or cotton was fed from large rollers into Myers' {{varnishing}} machine for processing. The processed wet fabric, soaked with varnish, was rubbed and pressed so the varnish {{would go into}} all the pores. The excess varnish was then removed and the wet fabric cloth hung outdoors in bright sunshine for 6 to 12 hours like laundry. The processed fabric had the elastic properties of rubber. This patented varnish that Myers invented was able to seal the balloon material to hold the hydrogen gas, that otherwise would penetrate even glass and metal. The silk or cloth fabric used required <b>eight</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> applications of the varnish to seal properly to be thoroughly impervious to hydrogen gas.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} to have been {{equipped}} with two 82m-long hangar decks for wheeled aircraft and a third 128m-long hangar deck for seaplanes; all of the hangars were 18.5m wide. The flight deck would have been 128.5m long and 18.7m wide. All three of the hangars and flight deck were intended to have been mounted above the main structural deck. The ship's designers intended to mount a take off deck on the bow, which would have been 30m long and 10.5m wide. According to naval historian Erich Gröner, the ship was designed to carry either 13 fixed-wing or 19 folding-wing seaplanes, along with around 10 wheeled aircraft. Rene Greger estimated the ship to carry <b>eight</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> fighter aircraft and a combination of fifteen to twenty bombers and torpedo-floatplanes.|$|E
5|$|USS Guam and USS Trenton began transit {{from the}} coast of Oman towards Mogadishu at 22:30 (23:30 Oman time) on 2 January. The {{commander}} of Amphibious Group Two had initially proposed a seven-ship Amphibious Task Group, composed of vessels anchored at Masirah Island (off Oman) and Dubai and including four amphibious ships so that {{the full range of}} amphibious capabilities would be available for the operation. However, intervention in Kuwait seemed imminent and the commander of naval forces at Central Command did not want to divert that many ships from the Persian Gulf, thus the decision to send two of the closest ships. Although the two vessels were selected by mid-afternoon on 2 January, the transfer of some personnel from Dubai to Masirah caused a delay of <b>eight</b> <b>to</b> <b>ten</b> hours. Guam and Trenton carried forces from the 4th Marine Expeditionary Brigade, including a detachment of CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters—the largest helicopters operated by the US military—and two squadrons of CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters.|$|E
