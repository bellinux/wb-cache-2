25|$|Structural {{analysis}} is {{the branch of}} mechanical engineering (and also civil engineering) devoted to examining why and how objects fail and to fix the objects and their performance. Structural failures occur in two general modes: static failure, and <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure.</b> Static structural failure occurs when, upon being loaded (having a force applied) the object being analyzed either breaks or is deformed plastically, depending on the criterion for failure. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> occurs when an object fails {{after a number of}} repeated loading and unloading cycles. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> occurs because of imperfections in the object: a microscopic crack {{on the surface of the}} object, for instance, will grow slightly with each cycle (propagation) until the crack is large enough to cause ultimate failure.|$|E

40|$|A {{review of}} records {{maintained}} by the National Transportation Safety Board showed that 16, 054 civil aviation accidents occurred in the United States during the 3 -year period ending December 31, 1969. Material failure was {{an important factor in}} the cause of 942 of these accidents. Fatigue was identified as the mode of the material failures associated with the cause of 155 accidents and in many other accidents the records indicated that <b>fatigue</b> <b>failures</b> might have been involved. There were 27 fatal accidents and 157 fatalities in accidents in which <b>fatigue</b> <b>failures</b> of metal components were definitely identified. <b>Fatigue</b> <b>failures</b> associated with accidents occurred most frequently in landing-gear components, followed in order by powerplant, propeller, and structural components in fixed-wing aircraft and tail-rotor and main-rotor components in rotorcraft. In a study of 230 laboratory reports on failed components associated with the cause of accidents, fatigue was identified as the mode of failure in more than 60 percent of the failed components. The most frequently identified cause of fatigue, as well as most other types of material failures, was improper maintenance (including inadequate inspection). Fabrication defects, design deficiencies, defective material, and abnormal service damage also caused many <b>fatigue</b> <b>failures.</b> Four case histories of major accidents are included in the paper as illustrations of some of the factors invovled in <b>fatigue</b> <b>failures</b> of aircraft components...|$|R

Because {{it is the}} material of choice for applications requiring enormous flexibility and motion (e.g., peripheral stents, heart valves, smart thermomechanical actuators and electromechanical microactuators), it is necessarily exposed to much greater fatigue strains compared to other metals. While the strain-controlled fatigue performance of nitinol is superior to all other known metals, <b>fatigue</b> <b>failures</b> have been observed in the most demanding applications.

40|$|Corrosion is {{well known}} to reduce the {{structural}} integrity of aluminium alloy aircraft components. In addition, it can cause early <b>fatigue</b> <b>failures</b> in components in which fatigue is {{not considered to be}} a life limiting factor. This is because corrosion damage, such as corrosion pits, is up to 100 {{times the size of the}} inclusions intrinsic in most aerospace aluminium alloys. The trailing edge flap lug of the F/A- 18 Hornet aircraft is an example of an unexpected failure due to corrosion damage. In this report a Monte Carlo model is developed to simulate this phenomenon. This model predicts the fatigue lives of corroded and uncorroded specimens of the aluminium alloy 7010 -T 7651. It does this using high-quality fatigue crack growth data for this alloy from a previous research project (SICAS) combined with probability density functions for size of the corrosion pits and inclusions in this alloy. The distribution of the predicted fatigue lives is an excellent match for that observed in the SICAS project. The model was then extended to predict the location of <b>fatigue</b> <b>failures.</b> It showed that with good laboratory data the model could very accurately predict the location and life of pitting-induced <b>fatigue</b> <b>failures.</b> RELEASE LIMITATION Approved for public releas...|$|R

500|$|On 17 June 2000, a Class 73 train derailed at Nelaug Station on the Sørland Line. The {{train was}} {{traveling}} at slow speed and no-one was injured, but had the derailment happened at full speed, {{it could have}} been fatal. The derailment was caused by a <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> in the front axle of the train. All Class 71 and 73 trains were immediately grounded, and were investigated by maintenance crews. The derailed train had recently had its axle checked for fatigue, but no cracks had been found. On 19 June, NSB stated that they had made insufficient tests during the [...] controls. Class 71 had been through ultrasonic testing and were therefore allowed to resume operation the day after the accident. A DNV report from late August concluded with that the cracks had been caused by rust, which was again caused by water being sealed in by the corrosion-protective layer.|$|E

40|$|TutorialRotating {{disk and}} blade <b>fatigue</b> <b>failures</b> are usually a low {{percentage}} of failures in most machinery types, {{but other than}} coupling / shaft end failures remain {{some of the most}} problematic for extensive repairs. High-cycle <b>fatigue</b> <b>failures</b> of rotating disks and blades are not common in most machinery types, but when they occur, they require extensive repairs and resolution can be problematic. This paper is an update of the tutorial given at the 2004 Turbomachinery Symposium focusing on high-cycle <b>fatigue</b> <b>failures</b> in steam turbines, centrifugal and axial gas compressors in refineries and process plants. The failure theories and many of the descriptions for cases given in 2004 have been updated to include blade resonance concerns for potential flow as well as vane and blade wake effects. Disk vibratory modes can be of concern in many machines, but of little concern in others as will be explained. In addition, vibratory modes are included where blades are coupled via communication with the main disk. Over the past decade, fluid-structure-interaction computational methods and modal testing have improved and have been applied to failure theories and problem resolution in the given cases. There is also added information on the effects of mistuning blades and disks, some beneficial and some with serious concerns for increased resonant amplification. Finally, knowledge about acoustic pressure pulsation excitation, particularly for centrifugal impellers at rotating blade passing frequency, has been greatly expanded.

2500|$|In one {{series of}} tests {{conducted}} by Santa Cruz Bicycles, it was shown that for a frame design with identical shape and nearly similar weight, the carbon frame is considerably stronger than aluminum, when subjected to an overall force load (subjecting the frame to both tension and compression), and impact strength. [...] While carbon frames can be lightweight and strong, they may have lower impact resistance compared to other materials, and can be prone to damage if crashed or mishandled. Cracking and failure can result from a collision, but also from over tightening or improperly installing components.

2500|$|Typically, a bolt is {{tensioned}} (preloaded) by {{the application}} of a torque to either the bolt head or the nut. The applied torque causes the bolt to [...] "climb" [...] the thread causing a tensioning of the bolt and an equivalent compression in the components being fastened by the bolt. The preload developed in a bolt is due to the applied torque and {{is a function of the}} bolt diameter, the geometry of the threads, and the coefficients of friction that exist in the threads and under the torqued bolt head or nut. The stiffness of the components clamped by the bolt has no relation to the preload that is developed by the torque. The relative stiffness of the bolt and the clamped joint components do, however, determine the fraction of the external tension load that the bolt will carry and that in turn determines preload needed to prevent joint separation and by that means to reduce the range of stress the bolt experiences as the tension load is repeatedly applied. This determines the durability of the bolt when subjected to repeated tension loads. Maintaining a sufficient joint preload also prevents relative slippage of the joint components that would produce fretting wear that could result in a <b>fatigue</b> <b>failure</b> of those parts.|$|E
