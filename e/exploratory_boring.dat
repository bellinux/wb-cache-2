In May 2014, Dominion Virginia Power was awarded $47 million from the United States Department of Energy (DOE) to help fund the construction of a 12-megawatt demonstration project, consisting of two 6-megawatt offshore wind turbines. It intended to have them in full operation in 2017, but postponed the project since the single bid for construction was too high.

50|$|It was {{not until}} 1940 when coal {{supplies}} became critically low because of the Second World War that Leigh Creek coal was considered again. The deposits seemed extensive and extracting the coal by open cut methods was considered feasible. <b>Exploratory</b> <b>boring</b> started in 1941 and plans were made to develop the first open cut mine. Excavation started in 1943 {{under the control of}} the Engineering & Water Supply Department. It was apparent that the electricity supply industry would be the largest user of Leigh Creek coal so control of the coalfield was transferred to the Electricity Trust of South Australia (ETSA) in 1948.|$|E

An old artesian well stands {{north of the}} school grounds - {{part of an effort}} to secure deep water for the school in the 60's (WVA). It is believed that the well was an <b>exploratory</b> <b>bore</b> hole to determine and analyze the mineral content of the sub-surface of the surrounding area. Bore hole samples including sediment samples from surrounding open wells (Rapo, Brasileno, Casiple) were collected and sent for analysis.

50|$|In February 2009, the company, Scandinavian Highlands Holding A/S, {{published}} {{the results of}} geophysical investigations by its subsidiary, Harz Minerals GmbH, according to which hitherto unknown mineral deposits {{of the size of}} those at the Rammelsberg may be present, two kilometres west of the Rammelsberg ore deposits. In autumn 2009 several <b>exploratory</b> <b>bores</b> were sunk {{in the area of the}} Hessenkopf and Gosetal to a depth of 500-600 metres. At the end of January 2010, after a news blackout of several months, the company announced that they would soon be drilling to a depth of 800 metres, where they suspected there would be rich mineral deposits.|$|R
50|$|The Solinst {{continuous}} multichannel tubing (CMT) {{system is}} a system that uses custom-extruded flexible 1.7-inch OD multichannel MDPE tubing to monitor as many as seven discrete zones within a single borehole in either unconsolidated sedimentary or in bedrock. Prior to insertion, ports are created that allow groundwater to enter each of the six outer pie-shaped channels (nominal diameter=0.5 in) at different depths with a central hexagonal center channel (nominal diameter=0.4 in) at the bottom. The multichannel tubing can be extruded in lengths up to 300 feet and is generally shipped as 200 foot lengths in 4-ft-diameter coils. The desired length of tubing, equal to the total depth of the multilevel well plus stickup, is cut from the coil, and the well is built at the jobsite based on the hydrogeologic data obtained from the <b>exploratory</b> <b>boring</b> or other methods. The tubing is stiff enough to be easily handled, yet light and flexible enough to allow site workers to insert the multilevel well hand-over-hand into the borehole. To date, CMT installations have been almost entirely backfilled installations where the sand packs and bentonite seals are poured or tremied from the ground surface. Einarson and Cherry (2002) provide additional information on the CMT system. More information is also provided by Solinst.|$|E

40|$|This {{memorandum}} summarizes our {{preliminary evaluation}} of the productivity of the shallow alluvial aquifer underlying the planned liquefied natural gas (LNG) offloading terminal at Bradwood Landing and the potential production rate of the planned on-site groundwater production well (Well 1). The conclusions presented in this memorandum are based solely upon our review of the subsurface investigation and exploratory borings completed by URS (2005) and our past experience with alluvial aquifers in similar localities. Based on the exploratory borings completed at the site, the shallow subsurface consists of up to 30 feet of dredge fill and fine-grained silt and clay overlying an approximately 60 foot thick alluvial sequence of fine- to medium-grained silty sand to sand (the “Upper Sand Package ” described by URS), which is underlain by approximately 40 feet of fine-grained silt and clay. An <b>exploratory</b> <b>boring</b> completed approximately 200 feet from the proposed location for Well 1 is provided in Attachment 1 to illustrate the subsurface geology {{in the vicinity of}} the proposed well site. Columbia River bathymetry data for the channel near the site indicates that the elevation of the Columbia River channel bottom is approximately- 20 to- 50 ft MSL 1, which is coinciden...|$|E
50|$|The {{greater part}} of Rutsweiler am Glan’s {{population}} worked even into the 1950s at the stone quarries around the Remigiusberg. Agriculture was worked as a secondary occupation, for the scant soil never would yield up plentiful crops. Since that time, {{there has been a}} great shift in the economic base, and most villagers nowadays work in the service sector, administration and industry in Kusel and in the Kaiserslautern area. Most of the ﬁelds now lie fallow. Among independent businesses in Rutsweiler today are a bakery, a trout farming business, a building ﬁrm and an electrical installation ﬁrm. From 1893 to 1901, two deep-boring operations were undertaken on the Potzberg, whose purpose was to explore for the presence of coal. Even after two more <b>exploratory</b> <b>bores</b> in other municipalities, the results were unsatisfactory.|$|R
40|$|Taking into {{consideration}} natural depletion of reserves of hydrocarbons in Mesozoic deposits {{of the majority}} of operated deposits of North Caucasus and for the purpose of further development of oil and gas producing industry in the region it is necessary to involve a carbonaceous complex of Jura of West Pre-Caucasus with the burial depth of more than 5300  m in the development. When drafting engineering design for a construction of exploratory wells in complex mining and geological conditions driven by anomalously high overburden pressure and temperature, use of thoroughly studied field geological information and taking {{into consideration}} the experience of boring similar wells is important. The paper provides analysis of geophysical data, the results of complex studies of reservoir porosity and permeability features of rocks picked out of core-samples of the first exploratory well on Krupskaya zone (porosity, permeability, electrical, acoustic, lithological characteristics), pressure-and-temperature conditions. The information obtained allowed to specify technological parameters of boring and tailing-in and to give recommendations regarding the way of <b>exploratory</b> wells <b>boring</b> and use of borehole equipment. In order to avoid the development of significant hydrodynamic pressure in the borehole which provokes gas showings it is necessary to keep on a certain level of minimal values of mud rheology parameters (dynamic shear stress τ =  70 ¸ 135  dPa; plastic viscosity η =  25 ¸ 35  mPa·s). For the purpose of real-time keeping of overbalance with anomalously high overburden pressure, control and regulation of calculated head pressure a stripper head should be included into the equipment configuration. Furthermore well head equipment and blowout preventer equipment must be designed for expected gradient of overburden pressure...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is comprised}} of three chapters, each of which contributes {{to the field of}} behavioral finance. Two of the chapters focus on topics in environmental economics and the third on U. S. household finance. All of the papers analyze the incentives and behavior of individuals (or firms {{in the case of the}} first chapter) to provide insight into macro phenomena. "The Effects of Carbon Markets on Equity Prices and Volatility" uses a firm-level dataset of carbon assets and liabilities between 2005 and 2007 to examine the impact of volatile carbon prices on equity prices. I find that the changes to firms' market capitalizations during a period of falling carbon prices are explained by the change in the net present value of emission permit holdings. Equity prices respond to changes in the mark-to-market value of firms' carbon permit shortfalls or surpluses and carbon price volatility increases the volatility of equity prices. I also document considerable delays in the equity and options markets responses to developments in carbon markets and attribute these lagged responses to information constraints and the novelty of carbon markets. "Outstanding Debt and the Household Portfolio," co-written with my classmate Reza Shabani, alters a simple portfolio choice model to allow households to retire outstanding debt and realize a risk-free rate of return equal to the interest rate on that debt. Using the Survey of Consumer Finances we find that households with mortgage debt are 10 percent less likely to own stocks and 37 percent less likely to own bonds compared to similar households with no outstanding mortgage debt. To show that our results are not driven by irrational behavior amongst a subset of households, we construct two proxy variables for financial naivete. Finally we calculate the costs of non-optimal investment decisions in the presence of various forms of household debt including mortgages, home equity loans and credit card debt. We find that 26 percent of households should forego equity market participation on account of the high interest rates that they pay on their debt. "Crude Drilling: An Analysis of Incentives and Behavior in the Oil Industry During the 1860 s" explains why rates of oil extraction in the nascent oil industry far exceeded the profit maximizing levels predicted by the economic theory of non-renewable resources. The analysis combines historical narrative accounts with property sale and lease data and information on oil well owners to explain how individual incentives led to aggregate over-drilling. In particular, I focus on the incentives of under-capitalized wildcat drillers as an explanation for the excessive waste and under-investment that characterized the early oil market. I find that these poorer prospectors were incentivized to extract oil at higher than optimal rates because of the characteristics of their property lease contracts and the low-cost drilling technology they used to <b>bore</b> <b>exploratory</b> wells. Low barriers to entry in the early oil drilling business led to an influx of wildcat drillers into the nascent oil market and delayed the entry of additional well-capitalized drillers. The result was a market characterized by cyclical supply shocks, low levels of investment in storage and conservation, and corresponding price instability...|$|R
40|$|From the Proceedings of the 1990 Meetings of the Arizona Section - American Water Resources Association and the Hydrology Section - Arizona-Nevada Academy of Science - April 21, 1990, Arizona State University, Tempe, ArizonaNew {{regulations}} {{concerning the}} management of underground storage tanks (USTs) have resulted in increased awareness of environmental contamination resulting from leaking USTs. The objective of the typical underground storage tank investigation is to determine if any subsurface contamination has occurred {{as a result of}} tank or product line leakage, fuel spills or overfills. Soil contamination at underground storage tank sites is usually discovered during the removal and replacement of USTs. Techniques {{that can be used to}} detect the presence of soil contamination adjacent to existing USTs include soil vapor analysis, <b>exploratory</b> <b>boring,</b> and soil and ground water sampling. The lateral and vertical extent of contamination must be determined at any site which contains detectable quantities of contamination. Two common methods for determining the extent of contamination are over-excavation and borehole drilling and sampling. Boring design and location considerations include number of borings, borehole depth and spacing, and site sub -surface conditions. Differentiation between perched sub -surface water and aquifers is critical. Once an appropriate boring plan has been established, then a sampling and analysis plan must be adopted that meets the needs of the particular investigation. The determination of the extent of contamination at an underground storage tank site is the first step leading to site closure and remediation...|$|E
