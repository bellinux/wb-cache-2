5|$|On 19 June 1250, {{following}} the canonisation of Malcolm's wife Margaret by Pope Innocent IV, Margaret's remains were disinterred {{and placed in}} a reliquary. Tradition <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> as the reliquary was carried to the high altar of Dunfermline Abbey, past Malcolm's grave, it became too heavy to move. As a result, Malcolm's remains were also disinterred, and buried next to Margaret beside the altar.|$|E
5|$|Several legends about Jovan Vladimir {{have been}} {{recorded}} in western Macedonia. One <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that,</b> after he was beheaded, he brought {{his head to the}} Monastery of StJohn of Bigor. On a hill above the village of Pesočani in the Municipality of Debarca, there is a locality called Vladimirovo, at which some ruins can be seen. The locals claimed that Vladimir was born there, and brought his severed head there. The Church of StAthanasius near Pesočani, now in ruins, is reputed to have been built by Vladimir. People from the region gathered there each year {{on the eve of his}} feast day. They lit candles on the remains of the church's walls, and prayed to the saint. Tradition <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the Monastery of StNaum had a bell tower named after the saint, in the foundation of which a portion of his relics was placed.|$|E

5|$|Van Cortlandt Park is {{a popular}} site for {{cross-country}} running, owing to its miles of cinder trails and hills {{as well as its}} steep terrain. One legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> a cross-country coach thought that Van Cortlandt Park's tracks were too hard and instead went to the New Jersey Meadowlands to train. Its courses {{are some of the most}} utilized cross-country courses in the United States.|$|E
5|$|A belief {{from the}} Leskovac region states the ala is a monster with an {{enormous}} mouth who holds in her hand a big wooden spoon, with which she grabs and devours everything that gets in her way. One story <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> a man kept such an ala in his barn; she drank thirty liters of milk every day. Another warns that ale {{in the form of}} twelve ravens used to take the crops from vineyards.|$|E
5|$|Ala can “sneak” into humans, {{gaining a}} human form while {{retaining}} their own properties. A tradition <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> an ala sneaked into St. Simeon, {{which made him}} voracious, but St. Sava took her out of him. In a tale recorded in eastern Serbia and Bulgaria, a farmer killed an ala who possessed a skinny man living in a distant village, because the ala destroyed his vineyard. In another story, an ala gets into a deceased princess and devours the soldiers on watch.|$|E

5|$|Around 1000, Vladimir, still a boy, succeeded {{his father}} Petrislav as {{the ruler of}} Duklja. Petrislav is {{regarded}} as the earliest ruler of Duklja whose existence can be confirmed by primary sources, which also indicate that he was in close relations with Byzantium. The principality consisted of two provinces: Zenta in the south and Podgoria in the north. A local tradition <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Vladimir's court was situated on the hillock called Kraljič, at the village of Koštanjica near Lake Skadar, in the Krajina region of southeastern Montenegro. Near Kraljič lie the ruins of the Prečista Krajinska Church (dedicated to Theotokos), which already existed in Vladimir's time. According to Daniele Farlati, an 18th-century ecclesiastical historian, the court and residence of Serbian rulers once stood in Krajina.|$|E
5|$|Boosted by this spiritual experience, Afonso won {{the battle}} against an outnumbering enemy. Legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Afonso killed the five Moorish kings of the Seville, Badajoz, Elvas, Évora and Beja taifas, before decimating the enemy troops. Hence, in {{gratitude}} to Jesus, he incorporated five shields arranged in a cross—representing his divine-led victory over the five enemy kings—with each one carrying Christ's five wounds {{in the form of}} silver bezants. The sum of all bezants (doubling the ones in the central shield) would give thirty, symbolizing Judas Iscariot's thirty pieces of silver.|$|E
5|$|Caldas has a {{tradition}} of embroidery (bordado) possibly dating to the 15th century. Legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Queen Leonor's handmaidens, seeing the monarch without her usual brilliance after selling off her jewellery, embroidered her cloak so that it appeared to have golden threads. Caldas embroidery is almost always made with three shades of molasses brown thread on white linen, and on rare occasion with white thread on brown linen. Known for its symmetry, the craft's common themes include arachnids, spirals, angles, birds, hearts, crowns, and shrimp nets.|$|E

5|$|In some legends, Marko's wonder {{horse was}} a gift from a vila. A Serbian story says that {{he was looking for a}} horse who could bear him. To test a steed, he would grab him by the tail and sling him over his shoulder. Seeing a diseased piebald foal owned by some carters, Marko grabbed him by the tail but could not move him. He bought (and cured) the foal, naming him Šarac. He became an {{enormously}} powerful horse and Marko's inseparable companion. Macedonian legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> Marko, following a vilas advice, captured a sick horse on a mountain and cured him. Crusted patches on the horse's skin grew white hairs, and he became a piebald.|$|E
5|$|Legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the Cailleach {{was tired}} {{from a long}} day herding deer. Atop Ben Cruachan she fell asleep on her watch and a well she was tending overflowed, running down from the {{highlands}} and flooding the valleys below, forming first a river and then the loch. The overflowing well is a common motif in local Gaelic creation tales - {{as seen in the}} goddess Boann's similar creation of the River Boyne in Ireland. Other connections to the region include her above-mentioned strong ties with the fierce whirlpool in the Gulf of Corryvreckan.|$|E
5|$|Macbeth did {{not survive}} the English {{invasion}} for long, for he was defeated and mortally wounded or killed by the future Malcolm III ("King Malcolm Ceann-mor", son of Duncan I) {{on the north side}} of the Mounth in 1057, after retreating with his men over the Cairnamounth Pass to take his last stand at the battle at Lumphanan. The Prophecy of Berchán <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> he was wounded and died at Scone, sixty miles to the south, some days later. Macbeth's stepson Lulach was installed as king soon after.|$|E

He and Petrosino engaged in a brief conversation, then Cascioferro killed Petrosino and returned to join the dinner again. Historical reconstructions have dismissed this version and cannot locate Cascioferro {{at the scene of the}} crime.|$|E
5|$|Mythology <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> {{the forests}} of Vajjabhumi (west Birbhum) were hot-spots of Hindu and tantric activities. Some authors have called Birbhum by the name Kamkoti which relates to its tantric heritage. Tantrics, {{including}} the Vajrayana, the Shaktas, and the Buddhists established many temples for tantra sadhana rituals and Shakti worship. Birbhum has many Shakti Peethas such as Tarapith, Bakreshwar, Kankalitala, Fullara near Labhpur, Sainthia and Nalhati. One of the famous Shakti worshippers of Tarapith was Bamdev, popularly known as Bama Khyapa.|$|E
5|$|Once {{again in}} Buenos Aires, San Martín {{and his wife}} {{attended}} to the first official performance of the Argentine National Anthem, on 28 May 1813 at the Coliseo Theater.

5|$|One account <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> the Germans paid Bogdan-Pitești {{the cost}} of paper and printing, which had been {{hitherto}} provided, for free, by Cantacuzino. Bogdan-Pitești (and German funds) were probably involved in financing a new platform, Cronica, launched by Arghezi and Gala Galaction in February 1915. In October of that year, with probable German support, Bogdan-Pitești, Arghezi and Galaction set up another Germanophile newspaper, Libertatea ("Freedom"), presided upon, for a short while, by N. Fleva. According to one account, Fleva had earlier been approached to take over as Seara manager by German envoys Brociner and Hilmar von dem Bussche-Haddenhausen, but, realizing the implications, had refused.|$|E
5|$|Popular myth <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> a US Army {{airplane}} {{had flown}} over Villalba {{on the day}} of the invasion and dropped a yellow silk foulard marked with a black L (indicating Luciano). Two days later, three American tanks rolled into Villalba after driving thirty miles through enemy territory. Don Calogero climbed aboard and spent the next six days traveling through western Sicily organizing support for the advancing American troops. As General Patton's Third Division moved onward the signs of its dependence on Mafia support were obvious to the local population. The Mafia protected the roads from snipers, arranged enthusiastic welcomes for the advancing troops, and provided guides through the confusing mountain terrain.|$|E
5|$|Prior to {{the early}} eighteenth century, hunting was mostly by {{indigenous}} Indonesians. Legend <b>has</b> <b>it</b> <b>that</b> sometime in the early eighteenth century, around 1712, Captain Christopher Hussey, while cruising for right whales near shore, was blown offshore by a northerly wind, where he encountered a sperm whale pod and killed one. Although the story may not be true, sperm whales were indeed soon exploited by American whalers. Judge Paul Dudley, in his Essay upon the Natural History of Whales (1725), states that one Atkins, ten or twelve years in the trade, {{was among the first}} to catch sperm whales sometime around 1720 off the New England coast.|$|E
