5|$|Demand for <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> {{increased}} in the early 1950s. The <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> facility at Wabash, now renamed the Dana Plant by the Atomic Energy Commission, was reopened, and DuPont resumed production of <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> in May 1952. The site was used a pilot plant for a new production process using hydrogen sulphide. The <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> facility was closed again in early 1957. The facility, and a larger complex at the Savannah River Site had fulfilled its purpose, supplying <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> for the plutonium production reactors at Savannah River.|$|E
5|$|Canada was an {{alternative}} source of <b>heavy</b> <b>water.</b> Cominco {{had been involved}} in <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> research since 1934, and produced it at its smelting plant in Trail, British Columbia.

5|$|Cominco had {{produced}} electrolytic hydrogen at Trail, British Columbia, since 1930. Urey suggested in 1941 {{that it could}} produce <b>heavy</b> <b>water.</b> To the existing $10million plant consisting of 3,215 cells consuming 75MW of hydroelectric power, secondary electrolysis cells were added to increase the deuterium concentration in the water from 2.3% to 99.8%. For this process, Hugh Taylor of Princeton developed a platinum-on-carbon catalyst {{for the first three}} stages while Urey developed a nickel-chromia one for the fourth stage tower. The final cost was $2.8million. The Canadian Government did not officially learn of the project until August 1942. Trail's <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> production started in January 1944 and continued until 1956. <b>Heavy</b> <b>water</b> from Trail was used for Chicago Pile 3, the first reactor using <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> and natural uranium, which went critical on 15 May 1944.|$|E
5|$|Cominco's president, Selwyn G. Blaylock, was cautious. There {{might be}} no post-war demand for <b>heavy</b> <b>water,</b> and the patent {{on the process}} was held by Albert Edgar Knowles, so a {{profit-sharing}} agreement would be required. In response, Taylor offered $20,000 for plant modifications. There the matter rested until 6 December, when Blaylock {{had a meeting with}} the British physicist G. I. Higson, who informed him that Taylor had become discouraged with Cominco, and had decided to find another source of <b>heavy</b> <b>water.</b> Blaylock invited Taylor to visit Trail, which he did from 5 to 8 January 1942. The two soon found common ground. Blaylock agreed to produce <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> at Trail, and quickly secured approval from the Chairman of the Board, Sir Edward Beatty. A contract was signed on 1 August 1942. The <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> project became known as the P-9 Project in October 1942.|$|E
5|$|Intermediate {{product was}} shipped from Wabash and Alabama by rail in sealed metal containers. The {{finished}} product was shipped by rail from Morgantown via the Monongahela Railway and Trail via the Canadian Pacific Railway to the Manhattan Project's Metallurgical Laboratory at the University of Chicago. <b>Heavy</b> <b>water</b> from Trail {{was used for}} Chicago Pile 3 at Argonne, the first reactor using <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> and natural uranium. Designed by Eugene Wigner and built {{under the direction of}} Walter Zinn, it went critical on 15 May 1944. An allocation of <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> was used by the Chalk River Laboratories to build ZEEP under Kowarski's direction, which went critical in September 1945. This was followed by its NRX rector in 1947, which was also moderated by <b>heavy</b> <b>water.</b> Like CP-3 and ZEEP it was used for scientific research, and not for plutonium production.|$|E

40|$|High quality CTD {{data were}} {{collected}} {{in the north of}} the Shikoku Basin where an abyssal boundary current has been observed through direct current measurements. Analyses of hydrographic data showed: 1. Colder and saltier <b>water</b> (<b>heavier</b> <b>water)</b> compared to surrounding waters is found above the continental shelf-toe and the eastern flank of the Kyushu-Palau Ridge where the existence of the abyssal boundary current has been expected. The <b>heavier</b> <b>water</b> has a horizontal extent of about 50 km. 2. The <b>heavier</b> <b>water</b> has the vertical scale of 2000 m from the sea bottom, and is associated with a thermal wind shear which enhances a component of the flow toward a direction looking the Nankai Trough (a trough located along the northern end of the Shikoku Basin) to the left in the abyss. The assumed “level of no motion ” at about 2500 m depth gives the geostrophically estimated current in a good agreement with the directly measured current. A volume transport associated with the colder and higher salinity water is estimated to be about 2 Sv off Cape Shiono-misaki which may include a recirculation above the Nankai Trough. This is about twice of the transport estimated in the interior of the Shikoku Basin through a vorticity balance between the stretching term and latitudinal variation of the planetary vorticity. 1...|$|R
5|$|The Montreal team in Canada {{depended}} on the Americans for supplies of <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> from the US <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> plant in Trail, British Columbia, (which was under American contract), as well as technical information about plutonium. The Americans {{said that they would}} give <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> to the Montreal group only if it agreed to direct its research along the limited lines suggested by du Pont. Despite doing much good work, by June 1943 work at the Montreal Lab had come to a complete standstill. Morale was low and the Canadian Government proposed cancelling the project. In April 1944, a Combined Policy Committee meeting in Washington agreed that Canada would build a <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> reactor. John Cockcroft became the director. The Americans supported the project with information and visits. They also supplied material, for example, uranium and <b>heavy</b> <b>water.</b> The Chalk River Laboratories opened in 1944, and in 1946 the Montreal Laboratory was closed. The project developed the ZEEP reactor, which went critical in September 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{electrolytic}} finishing {{plant was}} established at Morgantown because that plant {{was under the}} control of DuPont's Ammonia Division. At this plant the output from the distillation plants, which was about 90% <b>heavy</b> <b>water,</b> was broken down by electrolysis into hydrogen and oxygen. The light hydrogen tends to be drawn off first, leaving the <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> behind. This process was repeated through several stages to yield a finished product that was 99.75% <b>heavy</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{properties}} of <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> {{had been discovered}} in 1932 by Harold Urey. In 1933, Leif Tronstad and Jomar Brun, the head of Norsk Hydro Rjukan, created a plan for industrial production of <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> in Norway. As Norsk Hydro were already producing ammonia for nitrogen fertilizer, Tronstad and Brun had realized that large amounts of electrolyzed water were available. Tronstad was paid by Norsk Hydro as a consultant. Already in 1934, Norsk Hydro had opened a plant near the power station at Vemork. This was the world's first plant for industrial mass production of <b>heavy</b> <b>water.</b> Both French and German scientists expressed interest in the project.|$|E
5000|$|Similarly, when <b>water</b> vapor condenses, <b>heavier</b> <b>water</b> {{molecules}} holding 18O atoms tend {{to condense}} and precipitate first. The water vapor gradient heading from the tropics to the poles gradually {{becomes more and}} more depleted of 18O. Snow falling in Canada has much less H218O than rain in Florida; similarly, snow falling in the center of ice sheets has a lighter [...] signature than that at its margins, since heavier 18O precipitates first.|$|R
5000|$|A {{naturally}} occurring example of non-biological kinetic fractionation occurs during the evaporation of seawater to form clouds under {{conditions in which}} {{some part of the}} transport is unidirectional, such as evaporation into very dry air [...] In this instance, isotopically lighter water molecules (i.e., those with 16O) will evaporate slightly more easily than will the isotopically <b>heavier</b> <b>water</b> molecules with 18O, and this difference will be greater than it would be if the evaporation was taking place under equilibrium conditions (with bidirectional transport).|$|R

5|$|Already in 1941, Tronstad {{was aware}} that <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> {{production}} at Vemork had greatly increased. In the beginning, Tronstad had not {{been aware of the}} connection between <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> and atomic weaponry, but it eventually became clear that Germany could be running a nuclear energy project, especially after Harold Urey visited the United Kingdom in November 1941. Tronstad later learned from Jomar Brun that further expansion of <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> production was being discussed. Brun had been a part of a small conference on the issue, hosted by Kurt Diebner in Berlin, in January 1942. Brun would later communicate with England through Einar Skinnarland, a covert Special Operations Executive agent hailing from Rjukan. In October 1942, Brun was summoned to England, reportedly at the request of Winston Churchill. Instead, a team of agents were parachuted into the area to gather more intelligence, under the codename Operation Grouse.|$|E

5|$|During World War II Norway was {{invaded by}} Germany and Tronstad {{conducted}} domestic resistance {{for one year}} before fleeing the country for England. There, he gathered valuable intelligence from Norwegian sources, both {{on the development of}} the V-2 rocket and the growing German interest in <b>heavy</b> <b>water.</b> In 1943 Tronstad planned Operation Gunnerside, in which the German access to <b>heavy</b> <b>water</b> processing at Vemork was severely impeded.

5|$|<b>Heavy</b> <b>water</b> {{is a form}} {{of water}} that {{contains}} a larger than normal amount of the hydrogen isotope deuterium, also known as heavy hydrogen, rather than the common hydrogen-1 isotope that makes up most of the hydrogen in ordinary water.
