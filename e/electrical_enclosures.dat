40|$|The {{focus of}} this task is to {{optimize}} the form and placement of a controller comprising the Grid Friendly™ appliance (GFA) controller, power supply and power relay (and/or a solid-state power electronic switch) that would command a domestic water heater to shed its load in response to stress on the electric power grid. The GFA controller would disconnect the water heater from its supply circuit whenever it senses a low voltage signal or other indicators of system stress communicated via the electric power distribution system. Power would be reconnected to the appliance when the GFA controller senses the absence of these signals. This project has also considered more frequent cycling of this controller’s relay switch to perform demand-side frequency regulation. The principal criteria considered in this optimization are reliability, cost and life expectancy of the GFA components. The alternative embodiments of the GFA equipment under consideration are: Option 1 - installation inside the insulation space of the water heater between the tank and jacket Option 2 containment in a separate nearby <b>electrical</b> <b>enclosure</b> Option 3 - as a modification or adjunct to the distribution panel housing and/or the breaker that protects the water heater supply circuit...|$|R

40|$|Plastic {{components}} are vital components of many engineered products, frequently representing 20 - 40 % {{of the product}} value. While injection molding {{is the most common}} process for economically producing complex designs in large quantities, a large initial monetary investment is required to develop appropriate tooling. Accordingly, injection molding may not be appropriate for applications that are not guaranteed to recoup the initial costs. In this paper, component cost and lead-time models are developed from industry data for an <b>electrical</b> <b>enclosure</b> consisting of two parts produced by a variety of low to medium volume manufacturing processes including fused deposition modeling, direct fabrication, and injection molding with used tooling, soft prototype tooling, and hard tooling. The viability of each process is compared with respect to the manufacturing cost and lead time for specific production quantities of one hundred, one thousand, and ten thousand. The results indicate that the average cost per enclosure assembly is highly sensitive to the production quantity, varying in range from $ 243 per enclosure for quantity one hundred to $ 0. 52 per enclosure for quantity ten thousand. The most appropriate process varies greatly with the desired production quantity and cost/lead time sensitivity. As such, a probabilistic analysis was utilized to evaluate the effect of uncertain demand and market delays, the result of which demonstrated the importance of maintaining supply chain flexibility by minimizing initial cost and lead time...|$|R

5000|$|Bonding" [...] is {{a method}} by which all {{electrically}} conductive materials and metallic surfaces of equipment and structures, not normally intended to be energized, are effectively interconnected together via a low impedance conductive means and path {{in order to avoid}} any appreciable potential difference between any separate points. The bonded interconnections of any specific electrically conductive materials, metallic surfaces of <b>enclosures,</b> <b>electrical</b> equipment, pipes, tubes or structures via a low impedance path are completely independent and unrelated to any intended contact or connection to Earth. For example, airplanes do not have any connection to the planet Earth when they are airborne. However, it is extremely important for the safety and welfare of passengers, crew and aircraft that all metallic parts and structures of an airplane be effectively bonded together. The laboratories and satellites orbiting in space above the planet Earth obviously have no direct connection with the surface of our planet. All conductive surfaces of these orbiting laboratories and satellites, though, must be effectively bonded together to avoid differences of potential from being induced across their surfaces from the countless charged particles and magnetic waves traveling through space.|$|R
