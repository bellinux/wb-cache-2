5|$|<b>Impermeable</b> plasma {{is a type}} {{of thermal}} plasma which acts like an <b>impermeable</b> solid with respect to gas or cold plasma and can be {{physically}} pushed. Interaction of cold gas and thermal plasma was briefly studied by a group led by Hannes Alfvén in 1960s and 1970s for its possible applications in insulation of fusion plasma from the reactor walls. However, later {{it was found that the}} external magnetic fields in this configuration could induce kink instabilities in the plasma and subsequently lead to an unexpectedly high heat loss to the walls.|$|E
5|$|In {{petroleum}} geology, {{these black}} shales {{are an important}} source rock that filled conventional petroleum reservoirs in overlying formations, are an unconventional shale gas reservoir, and are an <b>impermeable</b> seal that traps underlying conventional natural gas reservoirs.|$|E
5|$|Note: Anyone aiding {{a victim}} of CS gas {{exposure}} will also suffer similar severe irritation (unless goggles, gas masks, and <b>impermeable</b> gloves are worn).|$|E
5|$|It {{contains}} more than 151 different polypeptides, and has a very high protein-to-phospholipid ratio (more than 3:1 by weight, which is about 1protein for 15phospholipids). The inner membrane is home to around 1/5 of the total protein in a mitochondrion. In addition, the inner membrane is rich in an unusual phospholipid, cardiolipin. This phospholipid was originally discovered in cow hearts in 1942, and is usually characteristic of mitochondrial and bacterial plasma membranes. Cardiolipin contains four fatty acids rather than two, and may help to make the inner membrane <b>impermeable.</b> Unlike the outer membrane, the inner membrane doesn't contain porins, and is highly <b>impermeable</b> to all molecules. Almost all ions and molecules require special membrane transporters to enter or exit the matrix. Proteins are ferried into the matrix via the translocase of the inner membrane (TIM) complex or via Oxa1. In addition, there is a membrane potential across the inner membrane, formed {{by the action of}} the enzymes of the electron transport chain.|$|E
5|$|The {{lipid bilayer}} (or {{phospholipid}} bilayer) {{is a thin}} polar membrane made of two layers of lipid molecules. These membranes are flat sheets that form a continuous barrier around all cells. The cell membranes of almost all living organisms and many viruses are made of a lipid bilayer, as are the membranes surrounding the cell nucleus and other sub-cellular structures. The lipid bilayer is the barrier that keeps ions, proteins and other molecules where they are needed and prevents them from diffusing into areas where they should not be. Lipid bilayers are ideally suited to this role because, {{even though they are}} only a few nanometers in width, they are <b>impermeable</b> to most water-soluble (hydrophilic) molecules. Bilayers are particularly <b>impermeable</b> to ions, which allows cells to regulate salt concentrations and pH by transporting ions across their membranes using proteins called ion pumps.|$|E
5|$|The {{molluscan}} shell {{appears to}} have originated from a mucus coating, which eventually stiffened into a cuticle. This would have been <b>impermeable</b> and thus forced {{the development of more}} sophisticated respiratory apparatus in the form of gills. Eventually, the cuticle would have become mineralized, using the same genetic machinery (engrailed) as most other bilaterian skeletons. The first mollusc shell almost certainly was reinforced with the mineral aragonite.|$|E
5|$|Twyfelfontein is {{situated}} in the Huab valley of the Mount Etjo formation in southern Kunene Region of Namibia, an area formerly known as Damaraland. The rocks containing the art work are situated in a valley flanked by the slopes of a sandstone table mountain. An underground aquifer on an <b>impermeable</b> layer of shale sustains a spring in this otherwise very dry area.|$|E
5|$|According to the varying-permeability model, {{gas bubble}} nuclei are simply stable microbubbles. The {{stability}} of these microbubbles {{is due to}} elastic skins or membranes consisting of surface-active molecules. These skins are normally permeable to gas, and collapse is prevented by their compression strength. These skins can become stiff and effectively <b>impermeable</b> to gas when they are subjected to large compressions, typically exceeding 8atm, at which stage the pressure inside increases during further compression as predicted by Boyle's law.|$|E
5|$|Like {{most other}} coastal Orange County streams, the {{watershed}} of Aliso Creek is now heavily urbanized. With 70percent {{of the original}} land surface now underneath <b>impermeable</b> surfaces such as pavement and buildings, far more runoff now enters the creek—not only inducing an increased year-round flow, but much larger rainy season flows. In the 1920s and 1930s, devastating floods wreaked havoc on much of southern California; the Los Angeles Flood of 1938 was the most famous flooding episode of this period.|$|E
5|$|Reptiles {{evolved from}} amphibious {{ancestors}} which left the aquatic lifestyle and became terrestrial. To prevent loss of moisture reptilian skin lost the softness and moisture of amphibian skin {{and developing a}} thick stratum corneum with multiple layers of lipids which served as an <b>impermeable</b> barrier as well as provided protection from the ultraviolet. Over time, reptilian skin cells became highly keratinised, horny, sturdy and desiccated. The surfaces of the dermis and epidermis of all reptilian scales form a single contiguous sheet, {{as can be seen}} when the snake sheds its skin as a whole.|$|E
5|$|Scandium is a {{soft metal}} with a silvery appearance. It {{develops}} a slightly yellowish or pinkish cast when oxidized by air. It {{is susceptible to}} weathering and dissolves slowly in most dilute acids. It does not react with a 1:1 mixture of nitric acid (HNO3) and 48% hydrofluoric acid (HF), possibly due {{to the formation of}} an <b>impermeable</b> passive layer. Scandium turnings ignite in air with a brilliant yellow flame to form scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Certain genera of gram-positive bacteria, such as Bacillus, Clostridium, Sporohalobacter, Anaerobacter, and Heliobacterium, {{can form}} highly resistant, dormant {{structures}} called endospores. In almost all cases, one endospore is formed {{and this is}} not a reproductive process, although Anaerobacter can make up to seven endospores in a single cell. Endospores have a central core of cytoplasm containing DNA and ribosomes surrounded by a cortex layer and protected by an <b>impermeable</b> and rigid coat. Dipicolinic acid is a chemical compound that composes 5% to 15% of the dry weight of bacterial spores. It is implicated as responsible for the heat resistance of the endospore.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, a {{group of}} {{materials}} scientists reported that they have successfully generated stable <b>impermeable</b> plasma with no magnetic confinement using only an ultrahigh-pressure blanket of cold gas. While spectroscopic data {{on the characteristics of}} plasma were claimed to be difficult to obtain due to the high pressure, the passive effect of plasma on synthesis of different nanostructures clearly suggested the effective confinement. They also showed that upon maintaining the impermeability for a few tens of seconds, screening of ions at the plasma-gas interface could give rise to a strong secondary mode of heating (known as viscous heating) leading to different kinetics of reactions and formation of complex nanomaterials.|$|E
5|$|Surrounding the {{southern}} part of Lake Okeechobee is the Fort Thompson Formation, made of dense, hard limestone, shells, and sand. Rain water is less likely to erode the limestone to form solution holes—smaller versions of sinkholes that do not intersect with the water table. In this formation the beds are generally <b>impermeable.</b> Underneath the metropolitan areas of Palm Beach County is the Anastasia Formation, composed of shelly limestone, coquina, and sand representing a former mangrove or salt marsh. The Anastasia Formation is much more permeable and filled with pocks and solution holes. The Fort Thompson and Anastasia Formations, and Miami Limestone and (x), were formed during the Sangamon interglacial period.|$|E
5|$|The {{generation}} of ATP by the mitochondrion from cytosolic NADH {{relies on the}} malate-aspartate shuttle (and to a lesser extent, the glycerol-phosphate shuttle) because the inner mitochondrial membrane is <b>impermeable</b> to NADH and NAD+. Instead of transferring the generated NADH, a malate dehydrogenase enzyme converts oxaloacetate to malate, which is translocated to the mitochondrial matrix. Another malate dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction occurs in the opposite direction, producing oxaloacetate and NADH from the newly transported malate and the mitochondrion's interior store of NAD+. A transaminase converts the oxaloacetate to aspartate for transport back across the membrane and into the intermembrane space.|$|E
5|$|The {{rocks are}} home to over 70 species of animals and 340 species of plants, which {{includes}} over 200 species of wildflowers. Vernal pools atop the plateaus fill {{during the rainy season}} in winter and spring because the andesite is <b>impermeable.</b> The dwarf woolly meadowfoam, a species of wildflower, grows around these pools, and is endemic to the rocks. The pools are also one of only a few places where the federally threatened species of fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, can be found. To protect these and other threatened species, the Bureau of Land Management has listed the rocks as an Area of Critical Environmental Concern since 1984.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the nuclear}} {{membrane}} is <b>impermeable</b> to large molecules, nuclear pores {{are required to}} regulate nuclear transport of molecules across the envelope. The pores cross both nuclear membranes, providing a channel through which larger molecules must be actively transported by carrier proteins while allowing free movement of small molecules and ions. Movement of large molecules such as proteins and RNA through the pores is required for both gene expression {{and the maintenance of}} chromosomes. Although the interior of the nucleus does not contain any membrane-bound sub compartments, its contents are not uniform, and a number of sub-nuclear bodies exist, made up of unique proteins, RNA molecules, and particular parts of the chromosomes. The best-known of these is the nucleolus, which is mainly involved in the assembly of ribosomes. After being produced in the nucleolus, ribosomes are exported to the cytoplasm where they translate mRNA.|$|E
5|$|The next day, Aya {{sees the}} orange {{mass of people}} from the park enter the city water supply. She goes to Dr. Klamp one more time, and discovers that Dr. Klamp has {{engineered}} special sperm for Eve so that she can create the Ultimate Being. He then spontaneously combusts. Aya finds Eve {{in another part of the}} museum, where the orange mass has surrounded her, forming an <b>impermeable</b> shield to protect her while the Ultimate Being gestates within her. After several failed attempts to attack Eve, the military asks Aya to attack her from a chopper, as she is the only one who can get close without combusting. The plan works, but Aya has to personally finish the fight on a now-wrecked Statue of Liberty, where Eve finally succumbs to necrosis due to her unstable cells. As Aya rests on a naval vessel, the Ultimate Being is born and attacks the surrounding ships. Aya does battle with the Ultimate Being, but its mitochondria causes it to evolve at an alarming rate. Aya sets the vessel's boiler pressure dangerously high, so as to destroy it with the Ultimate Being on board.|$|E
5|$|The {{skin of a}} teleost {{is largely}} <b>impermeable</b> to water, and the main {{interface}} between the fish's body and its surroundings is the gills. In freshwater, teleost fish gain water across their gills by osmosis, while in seawater they lose it. Similarly, salts diffuse outwards across the gills in freshwater and inwards in salt water. The European flounder spends most of its life in the sea but often migrates into estuaries and rivers. In the sea in one hour, it can gain Na+ ions equivalent to forty percent of its total free sodium content, with 75 percent of this entering through the gills and the remainder through drinking. By contrast, in rivers there is an exchange of just {{two percent of the}} body Na+ content per hour. As well as being able to selectively limit salt and water exchanged by diffusion, there is an active mechanism across the gills for the elimination of salt in sea water and its uptake in fresh water.|$|E
25|$|The grid's {{inherent}} {{high street}} and intersection frequencies produce {{large areas of}} <b>impermeable</b> surfaces in the street pavement and the sidewalks. In comparison to recent networks with discontinuous street types, grids can be up to 30% higher in <b>impermeable</b> surfaces attributable to roads. The emerging environmental priority of retaining as much as 90% of rain water on site becomes problematic with high percentages of <b>impermeable</b> surfaces. And since roads constitute the largest share of the total <b>impermeable</b> surfaces of a development, the difficulty {{is compounded by the}} grid type of layout. For these reasons modern planners have attempted to modify the rigid, uniform, classic grid.|$|E
25|$|This {{surface layer}} may vary in permeability, {{so that if}} the bubble is {{compressed}} it may become <b>impermeable</b> to diffusion at sufficient compression.|$|E
25|$|Most Gram-negative {{bacteria}} are intrinsically resistant to vancomycin because their outer membranes are <b>impermeable</b> to large glycopeptide molecules (with {{the exception of}} some non-gonococcal Neisseria species).|$|E
25|$|An aquifer is an {{underground}} layer of water-bearing permeable rock, rock fractures or unconsolidated materials (gravel, sand, or silt) from which groundwater can be extracted using a water well. The study of water flow in aquifers and {{the characterization of}} aquifers is called hydrogeology. Related terms include aquitard, which is a bed of low permeability along an aquifer, and aquiclude (or aquifuge), which is a solid, <b>impermeable</b> area underlying or overlying an aquifer. If the <b>impermeable</b> area overlies the aquifer, pressure could cause it to become a confined aquifer.|$|E
25|$|Other {{features}} of the military colors are a tie for attaching decorations, six sashes for the troops in the flag's guard and a protective cover of <b>impermeable</b> fabric.|$|E
25|$|Substrate {{with low}} {{porosity}} that permits limited transmission of groundwater {{is known as}} an aquitard. An aquiclude is a substrate with porosity that is so low it is virtually <b>impermeable</b> to groundwater.|$|E
25|$|The {{danger of}} {{pollution}} of municipal supplies is minimized by locating wells in areas of deep groundwater and <b>impermeable</b> soils, and careful testing and monitoring of the aquifer and nearby potential pollution sources.|$|E
25|$|Salt domes {{and salt}} glaciers {{are a common}} feature of the Zagros Mountains. Salt domes are an {{important}} target for petroleum exploration, as the <b>impermeable</b> salt frequently traps petroleum beneath other rock layers.|$|E
25|$|In seeds with combinational dormancy, {{the seed}} or fruit coat is <b>impermeable</b> to {{water and the}} embryo has {{physiological}} dormancy. Depending on the species, physical dormancy can be broken before or after physiological dormancy is broken.|$|E
25|$|Graphene {{has been}} found to allow {{positively}} charged hydrogen atoms or protons to pass through it, despite being <b>impermeable</b> to all other gases, including hydrogen itself. This could lead to major improvements in clean energy technology.|$|E
25|$|Interfaces {{within the}} crust. Typically, a {{horizontal}} detachment zone, a dense, <b>impermeable</b> layer {{or even a}} lithological interface may provide a horizontal plane of weakness which the ascending magma will exploit, forming a sill or lopolith.|$|E
25|$|Since the {{intertidal}} zone periodically desiccates, barnacles are well adapted against water loss. Their calcite shells are <b>impermeable,</b> and they possess two plates {{which they can}} slide across their apertures when not feeding. These plates also protect against predation.|$|E
25|$|ADH binds to {{principal}} {{cells in}} the collecting duct that translocate aquaporins to the membrane, allowing water to leave the normally <b>impermeable</b> membrane and be reabsorbed into the body by the vasa recta, thus increasing the plasma volume of the body.|$|E
25|$|The village {{primarily}} {{stands on}} Tunbridge Wells Sand and Wadhurst Clay. The combination of permeable and <b>impermeable</b> types creates {{an abundance of}} streams and springs in woodland areas. These are known Ghyll springs and streams, and are common in the High Weald.|$|E
25|$|An {{aquitard}} is a zone {{within the}} earth that restricts {{the flow of}} groundwater from one aquifer to another. A completely <b>impermeable</b> aquitard is called an aquiclude or aquifuge. Aquitards comprise layers of either clay or non-porous rock with low hydraulic conductivity.|$|E
25|$|The Government of Japan {{decided the}} policy {{to prevent the}} {{groundwater}} flowing in the reactor buildings. A frozen soil wall (Land-side <b>Impermeable</b> Wall) was scheduled for introduction to block the flow of groundwater and prevent its mixing with contaminated water.|$|E
25|$|Four {{geological}} strata, marine sediments {{laid down}} 90–100million years ago; pervious upper and middle chalk above slightly pervious lower chalk and finally <b>impermeable</b> Gault Clay. A sandy stratum, glauconitic marl (tortia), is {{in between the}} chalk marl and gault clay.|$|E
