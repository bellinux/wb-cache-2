25|$|In Syria, Nate and Sully meet Chloe and Cutter, who <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> Marlowe is {{the head}} of the same order to which Francis Drake belonged. The group finds the second crypt and the other half of the amulet, {{revealing}} the location of the next clue, in Yemen. As they escape Marlowe's men, Cutter breaks his leg. He and Chloe are forced to abandon the quest.|$|E

25|$|Wilder {{established}} the Gilda Radner Hereditary Cancer Program at Cedars-Sinai to screen high-risk candidates (such as women of Ashkenazi Jewish descent) and to run basic diagnostic tests. He testified before a Congressional committee that Radner's condition had been misdiagnosed {{and that if}} doctors had inquired more deeply into her family background they would <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> her grandmother, aunt, and cousin all died of ovarian cancer, and therefore they might have attacked the disease earlier.|$|E
25|$|At 6 months, infants {{are also}} able {{to make use of}} {{prosodic}} features of the ambient language to break the speech stream they are exposed to into meaningful units, e.g., they are better able to distinguish sounds that occur in stressed vs. unstressed syllables. This means that at 6 months infants have some knowledge of the stress patterns in the speech they are exposed and they <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> these patterns are meaningful.|$|E
25|$|And {{that the}} Church of Christ consisteth of meane persons, is no wonder; for wee <b>have</b> <b>learned,</b> <b>that</b> the poore receive the Gospell, {{and you know}} you have granted, that it stands with the light and Law of Nature, That the liberty, power, and rule, should be in the whole, and not in one man or a few; so that the power must rest in the body; and not in the Officers, though the Church be never so poore.|$|E
60|$|But Nebuchadnezzar {{required}} another lesson. He <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the God of the Jews was wiser {{than all}} the planets and heavenly lords and gods whom the Babylonian magicians consulted; he <b>had</b> not <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> that same God of the Jews was the Creator and Lord of heaven and earth. He <b>had</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the God of heaven favoured him, and had helped him toward his power and glory; but he thought that {{for that very reason}} the power and glory were his own--that he had a right over the souls and consciences of his subjects, and might make them worship what he liked, and how he liked.|$|R

25|$|Two detectives from RHD interrogated her {{the next}} month, July 2010. She {{told them she}} was {{concerned}} that events leading to Lazarus's arrest {{in which she was}} involved had been portrayed differently in the media than she recalled them, putting the department in a more favorable light. Nuttall as well, she recalled, had been placed in an equally difficult position, since he told her that Lazarus may <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> they had reopened the investigation despite the precautions he and Barba had taken.|$|E
25|$|Students {{complete}} {{requirements for}} the Master of Management in Health Care within one year by taking core business courses one night per week and health care courses one weekend per month. They also work in teams on a project. Most students are clinicians, physicians, or nurse managers; all candidates must have {{at least five years}} of work experience in their fields. Students <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> by following standard business practices, providers can improve the quality of care to patients and save money.|$|E
25|$|A bait ball is {{a last-ditch}} {{defensive}} measure adopted by fish schools {{when they are}} overwhelmed and more effective defensive strategies have broken down. Schooling fish are easier to attack once they abandon their free streaming behaviour and form into a tight bait ball. Many predator species <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> by interacting cooperatively they can panic schooling fish into forming a bait ball. This cooperative behaviour can occur both intraspecifically (among the individuals within a predator species) and interspecifically (across individuals belonging {{to more than one}} predator species).|$|E

25|$|I <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> {{many of the}} Greeks believe Pythagoras {{said all}} things are {{generated}} from number. The very assertion poses a difficulty: How can things which do not exist even be conceived to generate? But {{he did not say}} that all things come to be from number; rather, in accordance with number – on the grounds that order in the primary sense is in number and it is by participation in order that a first and a second and the rest sequentially are assigned to things which are counted.|$|E
25|$|To {{determine}} if infants were {{picking up on}} the statistical information, each infant was presented with multiple presentations of either a word from the artificial grammar or a nonword {{made up of the}} same syllables but presented in a random order. Infants who were presented with nonwords during the test phase listened significantly longer to these words than infants who were presented with words from the artificial grammar, showing a novelty preference for these new nonwords. However, the implementation of the test could also be due to infants learning serial-order information and not to actually learning transitional probabilities between words. That is, at test, infants heard strings such as dapiku and tilado that were never presented during learning; they could simply <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> the syllable ku never followed the syllable pi.|$|E
500|$|Crickets {{have many}} natural enemies and {{are subject to}} various {{pathogens}} and parasites. They are eaten by large numbers of vertebrate and invertebrate predators and their hard parts are often found during the examination of animal intestines.

They have fought armed struggles, and whatever they <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> is relevant to Mozambique we will use." [...] Guerrillas received tuition in subversion and political warfare as well as military aid, specifically shipments of 122mm artillery rockets in 1972, with 1600 advisors from Russia, Cuba and East Germany. FRELIMO adopted Marxism-Leninism at an early stage.|$|E
500|$|J.D. Shapiro, {{who wrote}} the {{original}} screenplay, was critical of the film as well. In a 2010 letter to The New York Post, he asserted that his draft bore {{little resemblance to the}} final script; the result, he said, was embarrassing: [...] "The only time I saw the movie was at the premiere, which was one too many times." [...] In Better Living Through Bad Movies, Scott Clevenger and Sheri Zollinger wrote, [...] "So what new truths have we gleaned from Battlefield Earth? First, we <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> spirituality is a fine thing, but it's probably best to avoid joining denominations that make action movies." ...|$|E
500|$|Almendra was {{released}} on November 29, 1969 on Vik, a subsidiary of RCA Records. Some sources, however, place {{the release of the}} album in early 1970, time in which the band released a typewritten, photocopied flyer that said: [...] "Over the course of six months of intense work, we <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> what is transcendent is no longer owned by the author and belongs to everyone. That is why January 15 is an important date for us and for you: it is the release of our first long play to you." [...] "Muchacha (ojos de papel)", with [...] "Ana no duerme" [...] as its B-side, {{was released}} as the album's only single on January 20, 1970.|$|E

500|$|Libby {{is one of}} the few main {{characters}} not to have a centric episode detailing her life before the crash. The writers said a reason for killing the character was so they could explore her backstory in a mysterious and posthumous way. The producers intended to explore Libby's backstory through flashbacks in the show's third season, and later in the fourth season, although her character did not appear. Although she appeared in [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", her backstory was not explored. In September 2008, the writers stated her backstory would probably be explored in the fifth season; however, Lindelof revealed in May 2009 her story would not be explored any further, saying, [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>learned</b> <b>that</b> if you kill someone off the show, they are less likely to cooperate with you". The producers said Watros was busy with other commitments, and they could not reveal Libby's story without her.|$|E
