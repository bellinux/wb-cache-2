The best weather was predicted between July 18 and 21, but the Potsdam Conference {{was due to}} start on July 16 and President Harry S.

5|$|Hurricane Alberto {{caused the}} worst {{flooding}} in western Cuba in 32years. The first tropical storm and hurricane of the 1982 Atlantic hurricane season, Alberto developed from a tropical disturbance on June 2 {{in the southern}} Gulf of Mexico. It rapidly organized and attained hurricane status the following day, the <b>earliest</b> <b>date</b> for a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean since Hurricane Alma in May 1970. Shortly after reaching peak winds off 85mph (140km/h), Alberto rapidly weakened due to approaching upper-level winds. Initial forecasts predicted the hurricane would continue northeastward into Florida; it turned sharply westward and drifted erratically for several days across the eastern Gulf of Mexico, before dissipating on June 6.|$|E
5|$|Of the {{off-season}} storms that struck land, {{portions of the}} Caribbean were affected most. Hurricane Alice was the only of the cyclones to strike land as a hurricane, doing so to islands in the northern Lesser Antilles; it caused locally heavy rainfall and moderate damage. No hurricanes have ever made landfall in the United States during December, although at one point a storm in 1925 was believed to have done this. One century earlier, a hurricane formed in the western Caribbean and struck Florida on or before June 3, which was the <b>earliest</b> <b>date</b> for a United States hurricane landfall. However, there is an unofficial hurricane in 1863 that struck the Florida panhandle, killing 110 people. The deadliest official off-season storm was a tropical storm in May 1948, which killed 80 people in the Dominican Republic.|$|E
5|$|On June 1, a {{tropical}} depression formed off western Cuba from an organized cloud system. It moved slowly northeastward through the Gulf of Mexico, and strengthened into Tropical Storm Alberto on June 3. Alberto traveled generally northeast on an erratic course, and briefly intensified to a Category1 hurricane, {{one of the}} earliest hurricanes of June, and the <b>earliest</b> <b>date</b> for a hurricane in the Atlantic Ocean since Hurricane Alma in May 1970. Due to strengthening vertical wind shear, Alberto then quickly weakened into {{a tropical}} storm, doubled back to the west, and dissipated near the Florida Keys on June 6. Alberto {{is an example of a}} storm to enter the Gulf of Mexico and dissipating while never make landfall, which is an unusual event.|$|E

5|$|The Pipe rolls, {{sometimes}} called the Great rolls, or the Great Rolls of the Pipe, are a collection of financial records maintained by the English Exchequer, or Treasury, and its successors. The <b>earliest</b> <b>date</b> from the 12th century, and the series extends, mostly complete, from then until 1833. They form the oldest continuous series of records concerning English governance kept by the English, British and United Kingdom governments, covering a span of about 700 years. The early medieval ones are especially useful for historical study, as they {{are some of the}} earliest financial records available from the Middle Ages. A similar set of records was developed for Normandy, which was ruled by the English kings from 1066 to 1205, but the Norman Pipe rolls have not survived in a continuous series like the English.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the {{instruments}} is unclear, though {{there have been many}} suggestions. Historical accounts, of which the <b>earliest</b> <b>date</b> from 588CE, note that young Japanese men traveled to Korea to study the kakko, a drum that originated in South China. This study and appropriation of Chinese instruments may have influenced the emergence of taiko. Certain court music styles, especially gigaku and gagaku, arrived in Japan through both Korea and China. In both traditions, dancers were accompanied by several instruments that included drums similar to taiko. Certain percussive patterns and terminology in togaku, an early dance and music style in Japan, in addition to physical features of the kakko, also reflect influence from both China and India on drum use in gagaku performance.|$|E

5|$|Traffic {{lights were}} downed by high winds, causing {{numerous}} traffic delays. Landslides along major roadways caused several accidents, one involving a bus that was damaged by rocks. One business was significantly damaged, {{with at least}} one main wall collapsing. To speed up the removal of debris, members of the Mexican army were deployed throughout Sinaloa. According to officials in Mexico, Tropical Depression One-E was the first known tropical cyclone to impact the state of Sinaloa during the month of June on record. With the system impacting land on June19, it marked the <b>earliest</b> <b>date</b> that a tropical cyclone had impacted the state, with the average date of first impact being August15.|$|E
5|$|When Tropical Storm Irene {{formed on}} August 7, {{it was the}} <b>earliest</b> <b>date</b> for the {{formation}} of the ninth tropical storm in an Atlantic hurricane season, beating the previous record held by a storm in the 1936 season by 13days. This storm also marked the fifth occasion the name Irene had been used to name a tropical cyclone in the Atlantic. Due to the lack of effects on land from Hurricane Irene, the name was not retired by the World Meteorological Organization and was reused in the 2011 Atlantic season; however, due to the extreme damage caused by the 2011's Irene, it was retired in 2012 and was replaced with the name Irma.|$|E
5|$|Alamo Force was {{responsible}} for coordinating plans for the invasion of western New Britain. The Arawe landing was scheduled for 15December as this was the <b>earliest</b> <b>date</b> by which the air bases around Nadzab in New Guinea, which were needed to support the landing, could be made operational. This date also gave the landing force time to conduct essential training and rehearsals. As Arawe {{was believed to be}} only weakly defended, Krueger decided to use a smaller force than the one which had been intended for the landing at Gasmata. This force, designated the Director Task Force, was concentrated at Goodenough Island where it was stripped of all equipment not needed for combat operations. Logistical plans called for the assault echelon to carry 30 days worth of general supplies and enough ammunition for three days of intensive combat. After the landing, holdings would be expanded to 60 days worth of general supplies and six days worth of all categories of ammunition other than anti-aircraft ammunition, for which a 10-day supply was thought necessary. The assault force and its supplies were to be carried in fast ships which could rapidly unload their cargo.|$|E
