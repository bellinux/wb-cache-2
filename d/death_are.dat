5|$|Because of its higher {{susceptibility}} {{and lower}} reliance on fire for reproduction, the optimal fire interval for B.prionotes {{is higher than}} for other Banksia species with which it occurs. One simulation suggested an interval of 18 years was optimal for B.prionotes, compared to 15 years for B.hookeriana and 11 years for B.attenuata. The same model suggested that B.prionotes is quite susceptible to reductions in fire intervals. On the other hand, it shows little susceptibility to increases in fire interval: although senescence and <b>death</b> <b>are</b> often observed in plants older than about 30 years, healthy stands have been observed that have escaped fire for 50 years. These stands have a multi-aged structure, demonstrating the occurrence of successful inter-fire recruitment.|$|E

5|$|Grindcore is {{an extreme}} genre of music that {{originated}} {{in the early to}} mid-1980s, drawing inspiration from the most abrasive-sounding musical styles: hardcore punk, extreme metal, industrial and noise rock. Grindcore is characterized by a noise-filled sound that uses heavily distorted, down-tuned guitars, grinding overdriven bass, high speed tempo, blast beats, and vocals which consist of growls and high-pitched shrieks. Early groups like Napalm <b>Death</b> <b>are</b> credited with laying the groundwork for the style. It is most prevalent today in North America and Europe, with popular contributors such as Brutal Truth and Nasum. Lyrical themes range from a primary focus on social and political concerns, to gory subject matter and black humor.|$|E

It is considered most likely, considering the writings of various ancient historians, that the poison was concealed in mushrooms (as Claudius was known to have been particularly fond of them), and Agrippina the Younger, Claudius' wife, is thought to have been the most likely to have instigated the murder or to have been the lead conspirator in the plot to overthrow Claudius.|$|E
