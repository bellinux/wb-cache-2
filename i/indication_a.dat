5000|$|Analog voting systems usually utilize either 2,175 Hz or 1,950 Hz as an <b>indication</b> <b>a</b> {{receiver}} is squelched or idle. In {{the case}} of 2,175 Hz, the steady tone leaking from a receiver phone line, or from {{the output of the}} voting comparator, may cause the transmitter to lock on. The most frequent cause of this is crosstalk in the telephone cables, frequently caused by a too-high audio level in the line (called [...] "overdriving" [...] the line).|$|E

It was subsequently determined that the false alarm had been created by a rare alignment of sunlight on high-altitude clouds above North Dakota and the Molniya orbits of the satellites, an error later corrected by cross-referencing a geostationary satellite.|$|E
50|$|Detailed {{examination}} of the NAV, and a letter on 24 August 1984 which related to the NAV switching failure mode, was passed to the investigators by McDonnel Douglas. The examination showed that the NAV mode, during its operation in-flight, {{can lead to a}} completely false LOC or GS indication ('ON' <b>indication).</b> <b>A</b> tiny red flag should have appeared on the indicator when the error occurred, but it didn't appear. This error occurred when the NAV receiver doesn't deliver an output signal. The letter was sent to every operators of DC-8, DC-9, C-9 and MD-80, which was equipped with the faulty NAV receiver.|$|E
5000|$|The {{forefront}} <b>indication</b> <b>a</b> {{depressive episode}} is manifesting is the sudden loss of energy or motivation in daily routines.

However, without an actual disease present, this neurotic thinking often results in severe anxiety, sleep disturbance, and mood swings which may hinder social relationships. Individuals with endogenous depression may experience inconsistencies in symptom severity [...] which is often the reason for delayed treatment. If left untreated, symptoms may progress to a major depressive episode.|$|E
