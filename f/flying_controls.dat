5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was controlled by}} a fighter-type control stick and rudder bar which operated the powered <b>flying</b> <b>controls</b> (PFCs). Each PFC had a single electro-hydraulic powered flying control unit (PFCU) except the rudder which had two, one running as a back-up. Artificial feel and autostabilisation {{in the form of}} pitch and yaw dampers were provided, as well as an auto mach trimmer.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} positive review {{scores and}} praise from gaming publications and news sources alike for its visual presentation and <b>flying</b> <b>controls.</b> Similar to its SNES predecessor, Pilotwings 64 serves {{to demonstrate the}} graphical capabilities of its gaming hardware. Although the flight simulator did not enjoy the same commercial success as its fellow launch game Super Mario 64, Pilotwings 64 nonetheless went on to sell over one million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{change to}} an AC system was a {{significant}} improvement. The Vulcan's powered <b>flying</b> <b>controls</b> were hydraulically actuated but each powered flying control unit (PFCU) had a hydraulic pump which was driven by an electric motor. Because there was no manual reversion, a total electrical failure {{would result in a}} loss of control. The standby batteries on the B.1 were designed to give enough power for 20 minutes of flying time but this proved to be optimistic and two aircraft, XA891 and XA908, crashed as a result.|$|E

50|$|The {{cause of}} the {{accident}} was {{the failure of the}} power <b>flying</b> <b>control</b> system. Plasma coating on the pistons of the power <b>flying</b> <b>control</b> system had flaked off and blocked the return valve, causing the aircraft to lose its maneuverability. It was revealed in 2007 that the failed component was inside a system that Copterline did not have the authority to service or even open. A periodic leak test that could have revealed the problem was omitted. Furthermore, the emergency floats failed to operate. The manufacturer, Sikorsky, confirmed that damages have been paid {{to the families of the}} casualties, but a court case between Copterline and Sikorsky is still pending.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an agent based control scheme for {{satellite}} formation flying is discussed.

5|$|The {{development}} process had involved {{extensive use of}} physical models; for one series of blowing trials, mixtures of focused hot and cold air were directed onto ground platforms to simulate the ground effect upon take-off. This work {{was considered to be}} critical to the project as there was very little knowledge of the adverse effects which could influence the aircraft during the vertical takeoff process; as there was no airflow over the ailerons, tailplane, and rudder while the aircraft was held in a stationary hover, wingtip control jets were experimented with as an alternative reaction control approach. These research included the development of an all-new control response simulator which linked a series of simple <b>flying</b> <b>controls</b> to a computer. By the end of 1958, barely eighteen months after the start of the project, all the main features of the P.1127 were developed with one exception, that being the reaction control system, the development of which was completed by April 1959.|$|E
25|$|The {{pilot was}} seated in the front, with the {{reconnaissance}} operator in the back. The back-seat occupant controlled the cameras and navigated the aircraft. However, the rear seat of the F-15A was fitted {{with a set of}} rudimentary <b>flying</b> <b>controls,</b> which made it possible for the reconnaissance operator to relieve the pilot if needed. Both crew members were rated pilots and both were trained in the reconnaissance task, so they usually alternated position on each flight.|$|E
25|$|The triplane {{design that}} was chosen {{employed}} a longer central plane with wingtip ailerons, with <b>flying</b> <b>controls</b> {{based on a}} fixed biplane tail and rudder at the rear and a canard biplane elevator section at the front. The internal structure was based on tubular-steel with linen-covered wings and interior sections; a four-wheel chassis or running gear formed the undercarriage. A Curtiss pusher engine drove a propeller through a chain and sprocket arrangement; later a Kirkham engine from the Baddeck No. 2 was substituted.|$|E

50|$|In 1972, {{aircraft}} again {{returned to}} Andrews Field (renamed Andrewsfield Aerodrome) when a 915m grass strip along {{part of the}} line of the original main runway was constructed. As flying increased, a clubhouse and <b>flying</b> <b>control</b> were erected in 1975 for the Andrewsfield Flying Club. The airfield was licensed by the CAA in 1976.|$|R

25|$|Mignet {{made the}} {{aircraft}} intentionally simple. The Flying Flea {{is essentially a}} highly staggered biplane, which almost could {{be considered to be}} a tandem wing aircraft, built of wood and fabric. The original design was a single-seater, and had two-axis <b>flying</b> <b>controls.</b> The aircraft had a standard control stick. Fore-and-aft movement controlled the front wing's angle of attack, increasing and decreasing the lift of the wing. Because the front wing was located forward of the center of gravity, that would pitch the nose up and down.|$|E
25|$|The CL-41 {{design was}} the product of the Canadair Preliminary Design department. The design {{incorporated}} a turbojet-powered, low-wing aircraft with a tricycle undercarriage and a T-type tail assembly. The <b>flying</b> <b>controls</b> are manual with spring tabs. The cabin, fitted with a rear-hinged canopy for both crew members, can be pressurized to a differential of 3 psi (20 kPa), the equivalent of about 2,000 m of altitude. It was designed to be a side-by-side trainer for providing elementary jet flight training and other training to an advanced level. The prototype first flew on 13 January 1960.|$|E
25|$|The SA.4 was {{designed}} for a crew of five: pilot, copilot, bombardier ("air bomber"), navigator and radio operator. The prone bombardier's position was a tube extending forward of the cockpit above the radome; the crew compartment being pressurized. These positions were fitted with opaque nosecones, as the Sperrins were never used for live bombing. The pilot was {{the only member of}} the crew to have a Martin-Baker-produced ejector seat underneath a jettisonable roof panel; other crew members were intended to bail out via a door located under the navigator's console. The other three crew positions were located behind the pilots, facing rearwards. Unusually, the pilot's <b>flying</b> <b>controls</b> lacked any direct connection to the aircraft's flight control surfaces, control input was instead directed into a gearbox to actuate rotatable ball-screw jacks to move each flight surface via aerodynamic load instead; a corresponding artificial feel system was also installed. Bill Gunston and Peter Gilchrist describe the control system as having been simple, light, reliable, and low-friction and contrast it positively against powered systems of the era.|$|E

50|$|The {{wings are}} {{constructed}} of tubular {{front and rear}} spars. The wings and <b>flying</b> <b>control</b> surfaces are covered in Kevlar/Mylar/Polyester laminate. The wings can be removed or folded (if an optional folding kit is installed) for storage and transportation. The wing tips are of composite construction which reduces drag and improves low speed handling. Access to the cabin is provided by two gull-wing doors.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—To achieve stable {{flying height}} of a pickup head in {{near-field}} optical disk drives, this study investigates a discrete sliding mode control with a frequency-shaped sliding surface.

500|$|The P.1127 was {{equipped}} with entirely conventional <b>flying</b> <b>controls</b> when operated within the normal flying regime; to avoid aerodynamic stall conditions when decelerating to slow speeds, control would be gradually and automatically transferred to the reaction jets, or [...] "puffers", by bleeding more air from the compressor as the engine nozzles were moved towards the downwards position. An auto-stabilisation system was installed upon all aircraft; the necessity of such a feature is arguable, as countless transitions between vertical and horizontal flight were performed with the auto-stabiliser equipment being entirely disabled.|$|E
500|$|The name, [...] "Britannia" [...] {{was chosen}} in April 1950 with Britannia 101 the {{designation}} for first two prototypes {{powered by the}} early series Proteus 625, the follow-up from the 600 series engine that had successfully completed its type trials. The first prototype, registered G-ALBO, with Bristol Chief Test Pilot A.J. [...] "Bill" [...] Pegg at the controls, flew {{for the first time}} on 16 August 1952 at Filton Aerodrome. The maiden flight was eventful as the over-sensitive <b>flying</b> <b>controls</b> led to a wild pitching before Pegg restored control. During the landing approach, smoke filled the cockpit and the main undercarriage bogie was stuck in its cycle, only fully deploying seconds before landing. The [...] "snags" [...] proved to be minor and by September, the prototype was cleared to perform at the 1952 SBAC Display at Farnborough where spectators commented on the [...] "quietness" [...] of the giant airliner. In November 1952, Popular Science reported that by 1954 BOAC would have 25 of these aircraft on routes such as London-to-Tokyo over the Arctic and North Pole. However, in 1953 and 1954, three de Havilland Comets crashed without explanation, and the Air Ministry demanded the Britannia undergo lengthy tests. Further delays were attributed to teething problems with the engine resulting in the loss in December 1953 of the second prototype, G-ALRX, caused by a failed reduction gear that led to an engine fire and the aircraft landing on the mudflats of the Severn Estuary. Resolving easily avoidable inlet icing issues – by selecting a slightly different cruising height than that specified – which were exaggerated by BOAC destroying the Britannia's sales prospects and delaying the Britannia's introduction by two years, also took time. The first prototype G-ALBO was subsequently modified to more closely approximate a production standard but was retained by the company to undergo engine testing and development.|$|E
2500|$|Ground {{testing in}} a static rig {{commenced}} in 1956, but the Oryx engines failed to develop full power and maximum gas flow. Even with {{modifications to the}} power units, the first flight was aborted when the P.74 failed to fly. This may have been providential as there were no escape provisions for the two pilots. The only entrance door was located at the rear on the port side. The primary test pilot was famously quoted as saying the hapless P.74 had, [...] "...the cockpit, <b>flying</b> <b>controls</b> and engine controls... designed without any input from a pilot." ...|$|E
50|$|In 1934 {{significant}} {{works were}} undertaken {{at the site}} and a large factory and imposing Art Deco administration buildings were constructed together with a flying school building which also housed <b>flying</b> <b>control.</b> Later, an experimental block {{was added to the}} north of the factory.

2500|$|In {{the event}} of pilot disorientation, the Flight Control System allows for rapid and {{automatic}} recovery by the simple press of a button. On selection of this cockpit control the FCS takes full control of the engines and <b>flying</b> <b>controls,</b> and automatically stabilises the aircraft in a wings level, gentle climbing attitude at 300 knots, until the pilot is ready to retake control. The aircraft also has an Automatic Low-Speed Recovery system (ALSR) which prevents it from departing from controlled flight at very low speeds and high angle of attack. The FCS system is able to detect a developing low-speed situation and to raise an audible and visual low-speed cockpit warning. This gives the pilot sufficient time to react and to recover the aircraft manually. If the pilot does not react, however, or if the warning is ignored, the ALSR takes control of the aircraft, selects maximum dry power for the engines and returns the aircraft to a safe flight condition. Depending on the attitude, the FCS employs an ALSR [...] "push", [...] "pull" [...] or [...] "knife-over" [...] manoeuvre.|$|E
2500|$|The Amiot 143 had {{the same}} high-wing and fixed {{undercarriage}} as the Amiot 140, with the wing thick enough to allow crew access to the engines by a tunnel between the wing spars. [...] The pilot sat in an enclosed cockpit, level with {{the leading edge of}} the wing and the navigator-bombardier, who was also provided with <b>flying</b> <b>controls,</b> sat in the extensively glazed gondola beneath the pilot. The radio operator sat towards the rear of the gondola and in early aircraft operated two 7.7mm (0.303in) Lewis guns. [...] Nose and dorsal turrets, each carrying a Lewis gun, completed the defensive armament, while the gondola also housed an internal bomb-bay. After 40 aircraft had been completed, the design was revised, with the aircraft being fitted with a longer nose (increasing overall length from 17.94m (58ft 10in) to 18.24m (59ft 10in), a revised fuel system and with the Lewis guns in the nose, dorsal turrets and ventral position replaced by single 7.5mm (.295in) MAC 1934 machine guns, with a fourth gun used by the navigator-bombardier firing through a hatch in the floor.|$|E
2500|$|The F-15E {{prototype}} was {{a modification}} of the two-seat F-15B. The F-15E, despite its origins, includes significant structural changes and much more powerful engines. The aft fuselage was designed to incorporate the more powerful engines with advanced engine bay structures and doors. [...] The advanced structures utilized Superplastic forming and diffusion bonding (SPF/DB) technologies. [...] The back seat is equipped for a weapon systems officer (WSO pronounced 'wizzo') to work the new air-to-ground avionics. The WSO uses multiple screens to display information from the radar, electronic warfare, or Thermographic cameras, monitor aircraft or weapons status and possible threats, select targets, and use an electronic moving map to navigate. Two hand controls are used to select new displays and to refine targeting information. Displays can be moved from one screen to another, chosen from a menu of display options. Unlike earlier two-place jets (e.g. the F-14 Tomcat and Navy variants of the F-4), whose back seat lacked <b>flying</b> <b>controls,</b> {{the back seat of}} the F-15E cockpit is equipped with its own stick and throttle so the WSO can take over flying, albeit with reduced visibility.|$|E

2500|$|The Saunders A.3 Valkyrie {{was built}} in {{response}} to Air Ministry specification 22/24 for a large general duty and patrol flying boat, Saunders receiving an order for a single prototype for trials in February 1925. It was a three-engined biplane with a two step monocoque hull, circular apart from the shallow, curved planing bottom. The fuselage had no internal bulkheads and was deliberately designed to be flexible so as to absorb the shocks of landing, {{though there was a}} rigid section under the wings. As with Saunders' other wooden aircraft, Valkyrie's hull [...] was covered with Consuta sewn stress-bearing plywood. It accommodated a crew of five. There was a pair of open tandem cockpits with dual <b>flying</b> <b>controls</b> well forward of the wing leading edge. Below this, aft and in the hull were the navigation and radio operator's position, and further aft, behind the trailing edge there were two gunners' positions, roughly in tandem but offset port and starboard, each fitted with machine guns on Scarff rings. The gunner's cockpit in the nose was similarly equipped. [...] There were bunks and living space for all five crew in the rigid part of the hull. The fin was large and angular, carrying the braced rectangular tailplane with unbalanced elevators above the top of the hull. [...] The fin also carried a large and prominently balanced rudder with a rudder servo surface on outriggers.|$|E
