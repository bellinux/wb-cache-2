5|$|Octopuses are <b>highly</b> <b>intelligent,</b> but {{the extent}} of their {{intelligence}} and learning capability are not well defined. Maze and problem-solving experiments have shown evidence of a memory system that can store both short- and long-term memory. It is not known precisely what contribution learning makes to adult octopus behaviour. Young octopuses learn nothing from their parents, as adults provide no parental care beyond tending to their eggs until the young octopuses hatch.|$|E

5|$|Archibald, 5th Earl of Rosebery, born in 1847, had {{inherited}} his title from his grandfather in 1868, when aged 21, {{together with an}} income of £30,000 a year. He owned 40,000acres (160km²) in Scotland, and land in Norfolk, Hertfordshire, and Kent. His father had {{died when he was}} eight and he had been brought up by his mother, who had subsequently married Harry Powlett, 4th Duke of Cleveland. His mother was a distant figure, and their relationship was always strained. The Earls of Rosebery, whose family name was Primrose, were old, if undistinguished, members of the Scottish aristocracy. Rosebery was considered to be strikingly handsome and immensely cultivated. He was <b>highly</b> <b>intelligent,</b> and a brilliant future was forecast for him by his tutors at both Eton and Christ Church, Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Francis has {{individualized}} features, to {{the point}} that the attention to his face gives it the quality of a portrait such as van Eyck's c. 1431 Portrait of Cardinal Niccolò Albergati. The head and face are minutely detailed. Francis is in his mid-thirties, wears stubble and has a somewhat jowly face and receding hairline. He is presented as a <b>highly</b> <b>intelligent</b> but perhaps detached and impassive individual. He is given a complex and inscrutable expression; physiological traits not uncommon in contemporary Flemish painting. He kneels on a bed of flowers, and his heavy robe and folded drapery have a choppy and overflowing feel. His lower limbs seem disconnected, positioned in an anti-naturalistic manner; giving the impression that he is levitating.|$|E
25|$|Next to {{predicting}} a group's performance on more complex criterion tasks {{as shown in}} the original experiments, the collective intelligence factor c was also found to predict group performance in diverse tasks in MBA classes lasting over several months. Thereby, <b>highly</b> collectively <b>intelligent</b> groups earned significantly higher scores on their group assignments although their members did not do any better on other individually performed assignments. Moreover, <b>highly</b> collective <b>intelligent</b> teams improved performance over time suggesting that more collectively intelligent teams learn better. This is another potential parallel to individual intelligence where more intelligent people are found to acquire new material quicker.|$|R

5|$|In {{intelligent}} mammals, such as primates, the cerebrum {{is larger}} {{relative to the}} rest of the brain. Intelligence itself is not easy to define, but indications of intelligence include the ability to learn, matched with behavioral flexibility. Rats, for example, are considered to be <b>highly</b> <b>intelligent,</b> as they can learn and perform new tasks, an ability that may be important when they first colonize a fresh habitat. In some mammals, food gathering appears to be related to intelligence: a deer feeding on plants has a brain smaller than a cat, which must think to outwit its prey.|$|E

While on the road, Ramsey receives a report about an armed suspect, and a brief chase ensues.

Experiments and invasive brain surgery at an Alliance secret facility left her delusional, paranoid, {{and at times}} violent, though her uncanny ability to seemingly sense things before they happen leaves questions as to where the delusions end and reality begins for her. The experiments seemed to have made her a psychic. The experiments also gave her a seemingly innate ability in hand-to-hand combat, and she is capable of killing or incapacitating several opponents with ease. She gets frequent fits of anxiety and experiences post-traumatic flashbacks of her time in the Alliance facility. Her mental instability and uncanny abilities, paired with several erratic and violent acts, are a recurring source of fear and doubt among the crew, especially with Jayne, whom she once slashed with a knife. Jayne very frequently requests that River and Simon {{be taken off the}} ship.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{combination}} of multi-functional machines and mobile robots supports emergence of <b>highly</b> flexible <b>intelligent</b> manufacturing systems (IMS). In {{this kind of}} manufacturing system some machines must, stay fixed at previously established positions (heavy equipment) but some types of multi-functional machines (small flexible equipment and mobile robots) can stay in one position for one or several periods and change their position for others periods, or change permanently {{their position in the}} shop floor. Moreover, using mobile robots allows performing transportation and operation Simultaneously. This possibility may change the decision processes and manufacturing system configuration, calling into question the existing decision methods in strategic, tactical mid operational levels. This paper concerns the specific production systems in which mobile robots operate in the same shop floor {{and at the same time}} with conventional and multi-functional machines and humans. This kind of production system is more sophisticated than conventional manufacturing chain (as cellular manufacturing System) and can decrease the reactivity time and new products can be quickly introduced (as for dynamic cellular manufacturing system). However, the configuration and optimization of this kind of system is very different from conventional production systems. In thiS paper, in one hand, the advantages of this kind of system and then several difficulties and challenges from operation management and industrial engineering point of view in configuration, organization, planning and optimization of IMS is discussed and developed. As a first step it is considered that localization is a key issue in the <b>highly</b> flexible <b>intelligent</b> manufacturing. Several approaches exist for outdoor localization, but indoor localization is an open problem. In this work, it is presented and discussed the <b>highly</b> flexible <b>intelligent</b> manufacturing system and the indoor localization.
