5|$|Cacti {{are used}} as {{construction}} materials. Living cactus fences are employed as barricades. The woody parts of cacti, such as Cereus repandus and Echinopsis atacamensis, are used in buildings and in furniture. The frames of wattle and daub houses built by the Seri people of Mexico may use parts of Carnegiea gigantea. The very fine spines and hairs (trichomes) of some cacti were used {{as a source of}} fiber <b>for</b> <b>filling</b> pillows and in weaving.|$|E
5|$|Scholarly {{consensus}} favours an Anglo-Saxon, probably Kentish origin for the Bayeux tapestry. This famous {{narrative of}} the Conquest is not a true woven tapestry but an embroidered hanging worked in wool yarn on a tabby-woven linen ground using outline or stem stitch for lettering and the outlines of figures, and couching or laid work <b>for</b> <b>filling</b> in figures.|$|E

5|$|The Seventeenth Amendment (Amendment XVII) to the United States Constitution {{established}} the popular election of United States Senators {{by the people}} of the states. The amendment supersedes , Clauses 1 and 2 of the Constitution, under which senators were elected by state legislatures. It also alters the procedure <b>for</b> <b>filling</b> vacancies in the Senate, allowing for state legislatures to permit their governors to make temporary appointments until a special election can be held.|$|E
5|$|All of the inert {{versions}} {{went from}} the manufacturers directly to Wendover Army Air Field, Utah, by rail, where they were used by the 216th Base Unit in flight testing of the bomb. Some test drop missions were flown by the 509th Composite Group's 393d Bombardment Squadron as training exercises. The bombs intended as live ordnance were shipped to the Naval Ammunition Depot, McAlester, Oklahoma, <b>for</b> <b>filling</b> with explosives. The Composition B was poured as a slurry, solidified in a drying facility for 36 hours, sealed, and shipped by railroad to the Port Chicago Naval Magazine, California, for shipment by sea to Tinian.|$|E

5|$|Similar to the 1997 film, Air Force One, 24 {{featured}} the president's personal jumbo-jet (Air Force One). Air Force One {{was featured in}} 24 seasons 2 and 4. Air Force Two (carrying the Vice President but not the President) was featured in season 6. Several actors featured in 24, such as Xander Berkeley, Glenn Morshower, Wendy Crewson, Timothy Carhart, Jürgen Prochnow, Tom Everett and Spencer Garrett also appeared in the film Air Force One. The 25th amendment, which deals with succession to the Presidency and establishes procedures <b>for</b> <b>filling</b> a vacancy {{in the office of}} the Vice President and responding to Presidential disabilities, was also a shared theme between the film and the television series. 24 used the same Air Force One set from another television series, The West Wing.|$|E
5|$|In South Africa {{cylinders}} may {{be filled}} {{for commercial purposes}} by {{a person who is}} competent {{in the use of the}} filling equipment to be used, who knows the relevant sections of the applicable standards and regulations, and has written permission from the owner of the cylinder to fill it. The cylinder must be in test and suitable for the gas to be filled, and the cylinder may not be filled above the developed pressure for the temperature reached when it is filled. An external inspection of the cylinder must be made, and specified details of the cylinder and fill must be recorded. If the fill is of a gas other than air, the analysis of the completed fill must be recorded by the filler and signed by the customer. If the residual pressure in a cylinder presented <b>for</b> <b>filling</b> does not produce a reasonably strong flow of gas from the valve when opened the filler may refuse to fill the cylinder unless an acceptable reason is given for it being empty, as there is no way for the filler to check if it has been contaminated.|$|E
5|$|The moat was {{situated}} {{at a distance}} of about 20m from the outer wall. The moat itself was over 20m wide and as much as 10m deep, featuring a 1.5m tall crenellated wall on the inner side, serving as a first line of defence. Transverse walls cross the moat, tapering towards the top {{so as not to be}} used as bridges. Some of them have been shown to contain pipes carrying water into the city from the hill country to the city's north and west. Their role has therefore been interpreted as that of aqueducts <b>for</b> <b>filling</b> the moat and as dams dividing it into compartments and allowing the water to be retained over the course of the walls. According to Alexander van Millingen, however, there is little direct evidence in the accounts of the city's sieges to suggest that the moat was ever actually flooded. In the sections north of the Gate of St. Romanus, the steepness of the slopes of the Lycus valley made the construction maintenance of the moat problematic; it is probable therefore that the moat ended at the Gate of St. Romanus, and did not resume until after the Gate of Adrianople.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{essentially}} employs a thin-layer interface model <b>for</b> <b>filled</b> rock joints to analyze wave propagation across the jointed rock masses. The thin-layer interface model treats the rough-surfaced joint and the filling material as a continuum medium with a finite thickness. The filling medium is sandwiched between the adjacent rock materials. By back analysis, {{the relation between}} the normal stress and the closure of the filled joint are derived, where the effect of joint deformation process on the wave propagation through the joint is analyzed. Analytical solutions and laboratory tests are compared to evaluate the validity of the thin-layer interface model <b>for</b> <b>filled</b> rock joints with linear and nonlinear mechanical properties. The advantages and the disadvantages of the present approach are also discussed...|$|R
