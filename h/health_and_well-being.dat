40|$|Abstract This study aims {{to examine}} psychosocial factors {{associated}} with mental <b>health</b> <b>and</b> emotional <b>well-being</b> difficulties {{in a group of}} Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander adults. A self-reported survey was administered to 155 par-ticipants aged 18 – 80 from five Indigenous communities, who were recruited through local Aboriginal Community Con-trolled Health Services. Stress, resilience, mental <b>health</b> <b>and</b> emotional <b>well-being</b> were measured. Structural Equation Modelling was used to analyse the association of stress and resilience with mental <b>health</b> <b>and</b> emotional <b>well-being</b> difficul-ties. Seventy-eight participants had no mental health or emotional well-being difficulties but 77 participants were at risk. Low levels of resilience emerged as a key psychosocial factor associated with mental <b>health</b> <b>and</b> emotional <b>well-being</b> dif-ficulties while high levels of resilience were associated with a reduced risk. High levels of stress was related to an increased risk of experiencing mental <b>health</b> <b>and</b> emotional <b>well-being</b> difficulties. Improving our understanding of psychological characteristics associated with resilience in the face of stress can inform prevention and treatment interventions for stress-exposed individuals...|$|R

5|$|The novel Bulldog Drummond {{begins when}} Drummond places an {{advertisement}} {{in a newspaper}} looking for adventure to lift the ennui {{of his life in}} post-war London. The response comes from Phyllis Benton, who is concerned for the <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> of her father, over whom Henry Lakington and Carl Peterson have a hold. At {{the end of the novel}} Drummond and Phyllis marry, and remain married throughout the course of the McNeile and Fairlie series of books, in contrast to the films, which generally portray Drummond as unmarried. Phyllis becomes integral to the plot of some of the novels: she is kidnapped by Irma Peterson in several stories, including The Black Gang and The Female of the Species.|$|E
5|$|However, {{despite their}} vulnerability, some women in rural Malawi {{believe that they}} do, to a certain extent, have {{control over their own}} <b>health</b> <b>and</b> <b>well-being.</b> They tell their husbands that the HIV/AIDS {{epidemic}} has made sexual infidelity extremely dangerous and encourage them to refrain from engaging in extramarital sexual contact. In addition, many women are convinced that, by appealing to the vulnerability of their children (who will probably be orphaned if their parents contract HIV), they can convince their husbands to use condoms consistently during extramarital sexual encounters. Other women seek support from their friends and family members when they believe that their husbands' unsafe behaviors are putting their lives at risk. Finally, as a last resort, women might warn their husbands that they will visit the ankhoswe, or traditional marriage counselor, and demand divorce if their husbands refuse to remain faithful and actively prevent the transmission of the disease.|$|E

For self-assessed health, the dependent variable is categorical, and we estimate non-linear dynamic panel ordered probit models, while for psychological wellbeing, we estimate a dynamic linear specification. The results show that both contractual and working conditions have an influence on <b>health</b> <b>and</b> psychological <b>well-being</b> <b>and</b> that the impact is different for men and women...|$|R

40|$|There {{is growing}} {{attention}} in industry for the Vision Zero strategy, which {{in terms of}} work-related <b>health</b> <b>and</b> safety is often labelled as Zero Accident Vision or Zero Harm. The consequences of a genuine commitment to Vision Zero for addressing <b>health,</b> safety <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> <b>and</b> their synergies are discussed. The Vision Zero for work-related <b>health,</b> safety <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> {{is based on the}} assumption that all accidents, harm and work-related diseases are preventable. Vision Zero for <b>health,</b> safety <b>and</b> <b>well-being</b> is then the ambition and commitment to create and ensure safe and healthy work and to prevent all accidents, harm and work-related diseases in order to achieve excellence in <b>health,</b> safety <b>and</b> <b>well-being.</b> Implementation of Vision Zero is a process – rather than a target, and healthy organizations make use of a wide range of options to facilitate this process. There is sufficient evidence that fatigue, stress and work organization factors are important determinants of safety behaviour and safety performance. Even with a focus on preventing accidents these additional factors should also be addressed. A relevant challenge is the integration of the Vision Zero into broader business policy and practice. There is a continued need more empirical research in this area...|$|R
