The mirror blank was produced in 1969 {{as one of a}} set of four, along with those for the AAT, CFHT and Blanco telescopes, and was purchased for the WHT in 1979, ten years after it was made. The primary is solid and un-thinned, so no active optics system is required, despite its weight of [...] The mirror support cell holds the main mirror on a set of 60 pneumatic cylinders. Even under the most extreme loading (with the telescope pointing at the horizon, so the mirror is vertical) the shape of the mirror changes by only during normal operation the deformation is much smaller.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Glass-ceramic</b> :Glass ceramic {{is used to}} make {{products}} such as Corningware and Pyroflam, which have {{many of the best}} properties of both glass and ceramic cookware.

2500|$|<b>Glass-ceramic</b> {{materials}} {{share many}} properties with both non-crystalline glass and crystalline ceramics. They are {{formed as a}} glass, and then partially crystallized by heat treatment. For example, the microstructure of whiteware ceramics frequently contains both amorphous and crystalline phases.

2500|$|An {{electric}} stove {{is a large}} kitchen appliance {{that converts}} electricity into heat in order to cook and bake food. In addition to heated coils atop a stovetop range, <b>glass-ceramic</b> cooktops and induction stoves using electromagnetic induction {{have proven to be}} popular in commercial kitchens as well as for domestic use in homes. Canadian inventor Thomas Ahearn is often credited with inventing the electric cooking range in 1882. However, the first such patent for an electrical stove apparatus was awarded in the United States much earlier to George B. Simpson on September 20, 1859. Simpson's patent, US patent #25532 for an 'electro-heater' surface heated by an platinum-wire coil powered by batteries; is described in his own words to be useful to [...] "warm rooms, boil water, cook victuals...".|$|E
2500|$|Two {{types of}} glass solders are used: vitreous, and devitrifying. Vitreous solders retain their {{amorphous}} structure during remelting, can be reworked repeatedly, and are relatively transparent. Devitrifying solders undergo partial crystallization during solidifying, forming a <b>glass-ceramic,</b> {{a composite of}} glassy and crystalline phases. Devitrifying solders usually create a stronger mechanical bond, but are more temperature-sensitive and the seal {{is more likely to}} be leaky; due to their polycrystalline structure they tend to be translucent or opaque. Devitrifying solders are frequently [...] "thermosetting", as their melting temperature after recrystallization becomes significantly higher; this allows soldering the parts together at lower temperature than the subsequent bake-out without remelting the joint afterwards. Devitrifying solders frequently contain up to 25% zinc oxide. In production of cathode ray tubes, devitrifying solders based on PbO-B2O3-ZnO are used.|$|E

50|$|Compared to {{conventional}} kitchen stoves, <b>glass-ceramic</b> cooktops are relatively simple to clean, {{due to their}} flat surface. However, <b>glass-ceramic</b> cooktops can be scratched very easily, so {{care must be taken}} not to slide the cooking pans over the surface.

50|$|Diopside based {{ceramics}} and glass-ceramics have potential applications in various technological areas. A diopside based <b>glass-ceramic</b> named 'silceram' {{was produced by}} scientists from Imperial College, UK during the 1980s from blast furnace slag and other waste products.

50|$|After {{crystallization}} {{the dominant}} crystal phase {{in this type}} of <b>glass-ceramic</b> is a high-quartz solid solution (HQ s.s.). If the <b>glass-ceramic</b> is subjected to a more intense heat treatment, this HQ s.s. transforms into a keatite-solid solution (K s.s., sometimes wrongly named as beta-spodumene). This transition is non-reversible and reconstructive, which means bonds in the crystal-lattice are broken and new arranged. However, these two crystal phases show a very similar structure as Li could show.|$|E
50|$|In the 1970s, <b>glass-ceramic</b> {{cooktops}} {{started to}} appear. <b>Glass-ceramic</b> has very low thermal conductivity, a {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of practically zero, but lets infrared radiation pass very well. Electrical heating coils or infrared halogen lamps {{are used as}} heating elements. Because of its physical characteristics, the cooktop heats more quickly, less afterheat remains, and only the plate heats up while the adjacent surface remains cool. Also, these cooktops have a smooth surface and are thus easier to clean, but are markedly more expensive.|$|E

50|$|Glass-ceramics {{are used}} to make {{cookware}} (originally known by the brand name CorningWare) and stovetops which have both high resistance to thermal shock and extremely low permeability to liquids.

50|$|Some {{well-known}} {{brands of}} glass-ceramics are Pyroceram, Ceran (cooktops), Eurokera (cooktop, stoves and fireplaces), Zerodur (telescope mirrors), and Macor, Kanger (<b>Glass-Ceramic</b> for cooktop, stoves, microwave and fireplaces door). German manufacturer Schott introduced Zerodur in 1968, Ceran followed in 1971. Nippon Electric Glass of Japan is another worldwide manufacturer of glass ceramics, whose related products {{in this area}} include Firelite and Neoceram fire-rated glass. Keralite, manufactured by Vetrotech Saint-Gobain, is a specialty <b>glass-ceramic</b> fire and impact safety rated material for use in fire-rated applications.

50|$|A {{solid-state}} battery design is attractive for its safety, eliminating {{the chance of}} ignition from rupture. Current solid-state Li-air batteries use a lithium anode, a ceramic, glass, or <b>glass-ceramic</b> electrolyte, and a porous carbon cathode. The anode and cathode are typically separated from the electrolyte by polymer-ceramic composites that enhance charge transfer at the anode, and electrochemically couple the cathode to the electrolyte. The polymer-ceramic composites reduce overall impedance. The main drawback of the {{solid-state battery}} design is the low conductivity of most <b>glass-ceramic</b> electrolytes. The ionic conductivity of current lithium fast ion conductors is still lower than liquid electrolyte alternatives.|$|E

50|$|The pre-formed <b>glass-ceramic</b> blank of the {{secondary}} mirror will then be polished, and tested by Safran Reosc. The mirror will be shaped and polished to a precision of 15 nanometres (15 millionths of a millimetre) over the optical surface.|$|E
50|$|Foturan (notation of the manufacturer: FOTURAN) is a {{photosensitive}} glass by SCHOTT Corporation developed in 1984.

50|$|The most {{interesting}} properties of these glass-ceramics are their thermomechanical properties. <b>Glass-ceramic</b> from the LAS {{system is a}} mechanically strong material and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 800-1000 °C. The dominant crystalline phase of the LAS glass-ceramics, HQ s.s., has a strong negative {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE), keatite-solid solution as still a negative CTE but much higher than HQ s.s. These negative CTEs of the crystalline phase contrasts with the positive CTE of the residual glass. Adjusting the proportion of these phases offers a wide range of possible CTEs in the finished composite. Mostly for today's applications a low or even zero CTE is desired. Also a negative CTE is possible, which means, in contrast to most materials when heated up, such a <b>glass-ceramic</b> contracts. At a certain point, generally between 60% m/m and 80% m/m crystallinity, the two coefficients balance such that the <b>glass-ceramic</b> as a whole has a thermal expansion coefficient that is very close to zero. Also, when an interface between material will be subject to thermal fatigue, glass-ceramics can be adjusted to match the coefficient of the material they will be bonded to.|$|E
50|$|<b>Glass-ceramic</b> {{materials}} {{share many}} properties with both non-crystalline glasses and crystalline ceramics. They are {{formed as a}} glass, and then partially crystallized by heat treatment, producing both amorphous and crystalline phases so that crystalline grains are embedded within a non-crystalline intergranular phase.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{developed}} {{for use in}} the mirrors and mirror mounts of astronomical telescopes, LAS glass-ceramics have become known and entered the domestic market through its use in <b>glass-ceramic</b> cooktops, as well as cookware and bakeware or as high-performance reflectors for digital projectors.|$|E
