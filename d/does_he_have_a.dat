2500|$|After debuting at the Orpheum Theatre in San Francisco, the Broadway {{production}} {{opened at}} the Broadway Theatre on 25 September 1979 and closed on 26 June 1983, after 1,567 performances and 17 previews. Patti LuPone starred as Eva, with Mandy Patinkin as Che, Bob Gunton as Perón, Mark Syers as Magaldi, and Jane Ohringer as Perón's mistress. Harold Prince directed with choreography by Larry Fuller. [...] During the run, six actresses alternated playing the title role, in addition to LuPone: Terri Klausner (matinees), Nancy Opel (matinees), Pamela Blake (matinees), Derin Altay, Loni Ackerman and Florence Lacey. [...] Patinkin was replaced by future Tony Award winner Anthony Crivello. New York Times critic Frank Rich stated: [...] "Loni Ackerman, the current Eva Perón, has no discernible Latin blood, but she sings the role {{better than any of}} the American Evitas, as well as acting and dancing it with nonstop energy. Anthony Crivello, a performer new to me, is easily the best Che I've seen in New York or London: not only <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> supple voice, but he also moves with such grace that he lightens the heavy, moralizing tone his character must bear. He's so effective, in fact, that he almost convinces you that there's a sound reason for Che Guevara to be dragged into the Peron saga." [...] Tom Carter understudied Patinkin and performed as Che.|$|E

50|$|The {{students}} are explained as the reincarnations of their alter egos, {{as opposed to}} merely corresponding to them. Allie is an only child; she no longer has a brother.

Avalon High's team name is the Knights, not Excalibur.

[...] Lohafer was also a coach and he led the football Spoofhounds to state championship appearances in 1984, 1994, 1996 and a basketball state championship appearance in 1995.

Later that night, Hornblower takes Bush to an exclusive establishment, where he plays whist with Admiral Edward Pellew, Captain Hammond, and Hammond's nephew Jack, who aspires to serve under Hornblower. Hornblower's whist winnings are enough {{to pay the rent}} he owes to his landlady, Mrs. Mason; Mrs. Mason's daughter Maria is attracted to him.|$|E

50|$|Today it is {{peculiar}} {{that his}} name is not remembered for being the first American Latino performer to sing in English and Spanish and to further blend North and South American musical styles. Although he received awards and recognition in his day, his name and accomplishments appear {{not to have been}} passed down to later generations, nor was it seen fit to include his name in museums or have some type of monument or memorial in his hometown of Boyle Heights. No movie was ever made about his life, nor <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Some academics (with the exception of Loza, Tumpak, et al.) outright dismiss Russell simply because he was light-skinned, had European features, and Anglicized his name, instead of pouring over his myriad accomplishments as a Mexican-American, multilingual entertainer who performed in radio, television, motion pictures, and in venues all over the United States, Mexico, Latin America, and Europe.|$|E
50|$|The {{objective}} of Shadow of Memories is to guide player character Eike Kusch through the fictional German town of Lebensbaum (Life's Tree) as he travels through time {{to prevent and}} unmask his murderer. The game takes place in three parts: a prologue, eight chapters, and an epilogue. In the prologue and each chapter, Eike dies, is resurrected by the non-player character Homunculus, and travels back in time before his death {{with the intent of}} changing events to prevent it. Shadow of Memories lacks traditional action elements, and Eike cannot attack nor <b>does</b> <b>he</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> bar displaying his health. The digipad, a time-traveling item given to Eike by Homunculus, requires energy units, which the player can find scattered around the town. The gameplay primarily consists of time-traveling through the different eras, finding items, and interacting through dialogue with the non-player characters. Actions taken in one time period affect future ones; for example, if Eike removes a seal from the squire's manor in 1580, the seal will not appear in the present era.|$|E
