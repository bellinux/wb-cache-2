5000|$|On 27 June 2013, {{firmware}} version 2.0.2 was released with [...] "Improved <b>focusing</b> <b>speed</b> in One-Shot AF mode", among other fixes and improvements. The firmware update [...] "did in fact markedly improve the EOS M's speed" [...] over the camera's initial firmware, but its autofocus performance was reportedly [...] "still not {{as fast as}} many other compact system cameras".|$|E
50|$|The {{speed of}} the AF system is highly {{dependent}} on the widest aperture offered by the lens. F-stops of around 2 to 2.8 are generally considered optimal in terms of <b>focusing</b> <b>speed</b> and accuracy. Faster lenses than this (e.g.: 1.4 or 1.8) typically have very low depth of field, meaning that it takes longer to achieve correct focus, despite the increased amount of light.|$|E

40|$|We {{introduce}} an interactive, portable, {{and inexpensive}} solution for estimating refractive {{errors in the}} human eye. While expensive optical devices for automatic estimation of refractive correction exist, {{our goal is to}} greatly simplify the mechanism by putting the human subject in the loop. Our solution is based on a high-resolution programmable display and combines inexpensive optical elements, interactive GUI, and computational reconstruction. The key idea is to interface a lenticular view-dependent display with the human eye in close range - a few millimeters apart. Via this platform, we create a new range of interactivity that is extremely sensitive to parameters of the human eye, like refractive errors, focal range, <b>focusing</b> <b>speed,</b> lens opacity, etc. We propose several simple optical setups, verify their accuracy, precision, and validate them in a user study.

40|$|Focusing light {{deep inside}} living tissue {{has not been}} {{achieved}} despite its promise to {{play a central role}} in biomedical imaging, optical manipulation and therapy. To address this challenge, internal-guide-star-based wavefront engineering techniques [...] for example, time-reversed ultrasonically encoded (TRUE) optical focusing [...] were developed. The speeds of these techniques, however, were limited to no greater than 1 Hz, preventing them from in vivo applications. Here we improve the speed of optical focusing deep inside scattering media by two orders of magnitude, and focus diffuse light inside a dynamic scattering medium having a speckle correlation time as short as 5. 6 ms, typical of living tissue. By imaging a target, we demonstrate the first focusing of diffuse light inside a dynamic scattering medium containing living tissue. Since the achieved <b>focusing</b> <b>speed</b> approaches the tissue decorrelation rate, this work is an important step towards in vivo deep tissue noninvasive optical imaging, optogenetics and photodynamic therapy.

30|$|With the {{development}} of computer technology and image processing theory, the auto-focus technology based on the image processing has been continuously developed, {{and it is the}} trend of the current auto-focus technology. To improve the <b>focus</b> <b>speed,</b> Subbarao et al. put forward the defocus depth method based on the spatial domain convolution and the deconvolution transform, which is realized within the space and improved the <b>focus</b> <b>speed</b> obviously compared with the frequency domain [3]. Kehtarnavaz et al. chose the square gradient function to measure high-frequency component in the defocused image. The rule-based searching method is used to search for the focusing position of the lens, which is applied to the digital camera [4]. Gamadia et al. proposed an auto-focus method under low light, which adopted the image enhancement method to increase the contrast of the image, and the image contrast was measured by designing the focusing evaluation function [5]. For the different contrasts, an auto-focus method which is applied to television cameras was proposed [6]. Li et al. proposed an improved Canny edge detection algorithm and improved the image edge details of the image signal and suppressed the false edge by using the wavelet transform and adaptive median filter [7]. Combining with the defocus depth method, Qi et al. proposed a focus depth method [8]. This method was used to estimate the image defocusing amount in three positions and adjust the camera directly to the focus location nearby, and then search for the best focus position with a small step. With the characteristic superiority of accuracy, this method can improve the <b>focus</b> <b>speed</b> by 37 %. Han et al. put forward the Zernike's orthogonal auto-focus algorithm to avoid losing ideal characteristics of the focusing curve and being trapped in the local minima [9].|$|R

50|$|A {{dual speed}} focuser can provide two <b>{{focusing}}</b> <b>speeds</b> {{by using a}} set of co-axial knobs, one for fast focusing and another for fine focusing when the film or CCD is near the perfect focal plane. This {{is different from the}} two separate focusing knobs seen on low level microscopes. Another common reason to employ a dual-speed focuser is with the use of short focal length eyepieces, where the depth of focus is short, requiring critically accurate focusing.|$|R
