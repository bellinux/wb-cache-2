40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to fully characterize normosmic perception of stimuli expected to cause widely varying degrees of olfactory and nasal trigeminal stimulation and to directly evaluate the possible role of olfactory nerve stimulation in nasal irritation sensitivity. During each of four identical test sessions, four anosmic and 31 normosmic participants were presented with a range of concentrations extending from peri-threshold for normosmics to supra-threshold for anosmics. For each session, odor (0) and nasal irritation (Nl) sensitivities were summarized in terms of the concentrations required to produce four sensation levels ('iso-response ' concentrations). Within-participant variation in these iso-response concentrations was < 10 -fold for 95 % of normosmics, <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>O</b> and Nl. For O but not Nl, these apparent fluctuations in sensitivity were largely accounted for by the uncertainty surrounding the iso-response concentrations calculated for each session. Anosmics exhibited minimal within- and between-participant variation in Nl and required, for all but the highest perceptual level, a higher concentration than almost all normosmics. Between-participant variation, expressed in terms of 90 % confidence interval widths, was — 0. 5 log units <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>O</b> and Nl for the highest perceptual level, but increased to — 0. 8 and 1. 8 log units, respectively, for the lowest (peri-threshold) level. Our findings suggest that: (i) most apparent variation over time in O sensitivity is actually a reflection of the uncertainty surrounding estimates of sensitivity obtained for each session; (ii) within- and between-participant variation in 0 sensitivity is far less than is commonly reported; and (iii) low to moderate levels of Nl i...|$|E

40|$|The {{semiconducting}} silicides offer significant {{potential for}} use in optoelectronic devices. Full implementation of the materials, however, requires the ability to tailor the energy gap and band structure to permit the synthesis of heterojunctions.

As part of {{an investigation into the}} synthesis of semiconducting silicide heterostructures, a series of β-Fe(Si 1 −xGex) 2 epilayer samples, with nominal alloy content in the range 0 0. 04. Osmium silicide films have been grown by molecular beam epitaxy on Si(100). The silicides have been grown using e-beam evaporation sources <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>Os</b> and Si onto Si(100) substrates at varying growth rates and temperatures ranging from 600 - 700 ºC.

A change in crystalline quality is observed with an increase in Si overpressure. For a lower silicon to osmium flux ration (JSi/JOs= 1. 5) both OsSi 2 and Os 2 Si 3 occur, whereas with a much larger Si overpressure (JSi/JOs> 4), crystalline quality is greatly increased and only a single phase, Os 2 Si 3, is present. The out-of-plane X-ray diffraction data show that the film grows along its [4 0 2] direction, with a good crystal quality as evidenced by the small FWHM in the rocking curve.

40|$|In {{spite of}} the strict EU regulations, {{concentrations}} of surface ozone and PM 10 often exceed the pollution standards for The Netherlands and Europe. Their concentrations are controlled by (precursor) emissions, social and economic developments and a complex combination of meteorological actors. This study tackles the latter, and provides insight in the meteorological processes that {{play a role in}} O 3 and PM 10 levels in Cabauw (The Netherlands). The relations between meteorological actors and air quality are studied on a~local scale based on observations from Cabauw and are determined by a comprehensive correlation analysis and a multiple regression (MLR) analysis in 2 modes, with and without air quality variables as predictors. Furthermore, the objective Lamb Weather Type (WT) approach based on ECMWF (European Center for Medium-range Weather Forecasting) operational data is used to assess the influence of the large-scale circulation on air quality. Keeping in mind its future use in downscaling future climate scenarios for air quality purposes, special emphasis is given to an appropriate selection of the regressor variables readily available from operational meteorological forecasts or OAGCMs (Ocean-Atmosphere coupled General Circulation Models). The regression models perform satisfactory <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>O</b> 3 and PM 10, with an increased performance when including previous days air quality information. The lamb weather types show a seasonal distinct pattern for high (low) episodes of average O 3 and PM 10 concentrations, and these are clear related with the meteorology-air quality correlation analysis. Although using a circulation type approach can bring some interesting physical relations forward, our analysis reveals the circulation method is limited in terms of short-term air quality forecast <b>for</b> <b>both</b> <b>O</b> 3 and PM 10. In summary, it is concluded that the use of a regression model is more promising for short-term downscaling from climate scenarios than the use of a weather type classification approach...|$|E
