25|$|Other body systems {{affected}} by Lyme-like Disease. More common than EM are symptoms due to invasion by the spirochaete {{of the nervous}} system, heart, muscles and joints. These may start weeks or months after the tickbite. Initially, they may include flu-like illness, fever, headache, sore throat, fatigue, aching muscles and joints. More serious are meningitis, Bell's palsy (weakness of the face muscles), swelling of joints, and heart problems with palpitations and breathlessness. Lyme disease is difficult to distinguish from many other illnesses like Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) because the symptoms may be similar. If you have symptoms that could be Lyme disease, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not remember a tickbite, see your doctor. Diagnosis is helped by a blood test called a Western Blot test, but your doctor will consider whether any other illness could be causing your symptoms and may do some other tests.|$|E
500|$|Paul Gray {{wrote in}} a review in Time that the {{documents}} that make up Shikasta allow Lessing to stretch the novel out over vast periods of time and shift perspective [...] "dramatically from the near infinite to the minute". He said that the book's cohesiveness is its variety, and noted how Lessing interspaces her [...] "grand designs" [...] and [...] "configurations of enormous powers" [...] with [...] "passages of aching poignancy". Gray said that Shikasta is closer to Gulliver's Travels and the Old Testament {{than it is to}} Buck Rogers, and may disappoint readers interpreting her [...] "space fiction" [...] as [...] "science fiction". He found Lessing's bleak vision of Earth's history in which she suggests that humans [...] "could not... help making the messes they have, that their blunders were all ordained by a small tic in the cosmos", a little [...] "unsatisfying", but added that <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not subscribe to her theories, the book can still be enjoyable, [...] "even furiously engaging on every page". Gray called Shikasta [...] "an audacious and disturbing work from one of the world's great living writers".|$|E
2500|$|Hecklers {{interrupted}} Oren's speech ten times, {{with many}} students cheering them in support. Among other slogans, the hecklers yelled, [...] "Michael Oren, propagating murder {{is not an}} expression of free speech," [...] "killers" [...] and [...] "how many Palestinians did you kill?" [...] After the fourth disruption, Oren took a 20-minute leave {{before returning to the}} podium. Before continuing he said, [...] "I've spent most of my life living in and studying the Middle East and one of the great and eternal cultural facets of the Middle East is hospitality... <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not agree with them, even if they're ostensibly your enemy. I'm your guest here and I'm asking for the Middle Eastern hospitality for your guest, I've come into your house." [...] By the end of the program, 11 UC Irvine and Riverside students were reportedly arrested.|$|E
