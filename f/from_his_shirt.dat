2500|$|Mia {{insists that}} it's common {{knowledge}} that he's the third best-looking guy at AEHS after Josh Richter and Justin Baxendale and described his nose as aquiline, mouth as [...] "eminently kissable" [...] and neck as aromatic due to an intoxicating blend of Tide <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> collar, his Gillette shaving foam and Ivory soap and a special Michael smell makes it the best smell in the world. Michael loves Mia just as she is, though her neurotic behavior and insecurity can be frustrating. In fact, Michael {{is the one who}} often feels insecure in their relationship because he knows Clarisse Marie Renaldo does not think he is an appropriate consort and all the gossip magazines would much rather prefer to see Mia date a fellow royal or celebrity like James Franco or as Mia's other grandmother, Mamaw suggests Zac Efron from High School Musical. Due to this, Michael believes moving to Japan and developing his robotic arm would finally prove to the world that he is, in fact, worthy of dating a princess. Michael returns to New York a multi-millionaire and the president/owner of his own robotics company, Pavlov Robotics, named after his dog. [...] Michael donates a robot arm to Genovia from his company for free even though the waiting list is long, helping Mia's father win the election. Mia realizes that she is still in love with Michael, but tries to convince herself otherwise. When she and Michael kiss on a coach ride, however, she writes, [...] "I can't do this to J.P. I just can't. Oh my God, though, I love Michael so much." [...] When J.P. and Mia split due to J.P using her and lying to her, she and Michael reunite, spending the night together.|$|E

60|$|But he {{was very}} much in love. The next morning {{appeared}} in a drizzle of rain that followed the beautiful warmth of the day before. He had the coach all to himself, and in the damp and leathery solitude he drew out the little oval picture <b>from</b> beneath <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> frill and looked long and fixedly with a fond and foolish joy at the innocent face, the blue eyes, the red, smiling lips depicted upon the satinlike, ivory surface.|$|R

60|$|He {{tried his}} best, but though he {{followed}} his plan up for fully an hour not a bird did he hit, {{and by that}} time his arm was so tired that further throwing was out of the question.

When he had {{reached the end of the}} first row of casks he paused a moment to listen to the gurglings of the many half-inch streams running to waste. His quick ears caught a similar gurgling from the right in the direction of the next alleyway. Listening closely, he could have sworn he heard the sounds of a bit biting into hard wood.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the film}} was {{released}} in the United States, the death of Hsiao Mi, [...] "The Boss", was cut down to him simply being stabbed in the chest with a knife {{in order to receive}} an [...] "R" [...] rating. The original version of his death, which not only shows an explicit close-up of the knife in his chest but Cheng Chao-an's fingers piercing his rib cage and blood flowing <b>from</b> under <b>his</b> <b>shirt,</b> would have given the film an [...] "X" [...] rating. The first time this scene was shown in the US was when it played on cable channel AMC in July 2004.|$|R
60|$|They waited, sitting {{upon the}} stone. The {{rest of the}} men were at work out of sight around a bend in the road. Everything would have gone well--except, perhaps, with Corrigan, had not Tony been moved to {{decorate}} the plot with its conventional accompaniment. He was of dramatic blood, and perhaps he intuitively divined the appendage to villainous machinations as prescribed by the stage. He pulled <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> bosom a long, black, beautiful, venomous cigar, and handed it to Burney.|$|E
60|$|We {{stopped a}} minute. I tore off {{the sleeve of}} my hunting shirt, and then Rube gave me {{a bit of a}} cut on the arm. I let the blood run till the sleeve was soaked and dripping, then Rube tore off a strip <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> and bandaged my arm up tight. We rolled the sleeve in a ball and threw it down, then took a turn, made a zigzag or two to puzzle the brute, and then went on our line again. For another ten minutes we could hear the barking get nearer and nearer, and then it stopped all of a sudden. On we went, and it was half an hour again before we heard it, and then it was a long way off.|$|E
60|$|At last he saw {{him coming}} down the path with a stealthy, {{crouching}} step, with one musket slung behind him, {{and the other in}} his hand ready for instant action. He was a dreadful sight. His face was bound up with a sleeve cut <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt.</b> His forehead was encrusted and his hair matted with dried blood, with which also his linen jacket and trousers were thickly stained. Stephen had chosen a tree round whose foot was a thick growth of bush, and he now proceeded to put into execution the plan that he had decided upon. Stooping behind the trunk of the tree, he thrust up from among the bushes his cap {{on the top of a}} ramrod, taking care that the upper part only just showed above the leaves. Almost instantly Jacopo levelled his rifle and fired. Stephen gave a loud cry and dropped the cap. The Peruvian, with a yell of exultation, threw away the gun, drew his knife, and bounded forward. As he came up, Stephen sprang out, and brought the butt end of his gun down with all his strength on the Peruvian’s head, striking him senseless to the ground. Stephen picked up the murderer’s knife and placed it in his belt, took the musket from his shoulder, and then with a cord he had brought with him bound his feet, and turning him over fastened his wrists tightly together.|$|E

5000|$|By early June 1955, Peel {{was in a}} panic. The top {{legal officer}} in the county, Chillingworth, had already stated that Peel would get no second chance. Peel then hired Floyd [...] "Lucky" [...] Holzapfel (a known {{criminal}} and a carpenter's apprentice) to murder the Chillingworths. On the night of June 14, Holzapfel and an accomplice named Bobby Lincoln went to Manalapan and landed on the beach behind the Chillingworths' house around 1a.m. Bobby Lincoln crouched in the bushes as Holzapfel knocked on the door. The judge answered in his pajamas. Holzapfel pulled a pistol <b>from</b> under <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> and forced the judge and his wife into the boat. After the boat drifted for about an hour, the couple were thrown overboard with lead weights strapped to their legs.|$|R
50|$|The {{unexpected}} {{death of}} Aaron appears {{to make the}} argument that his death is merely an allusion to the mysterious and miraculous death of Moses. In the accounts of Moses’ death, al-Tabari reports, “While Moses was walking with his servant Joshua, a black wind suddenly approached. When Joshua saw it, he thought that the Hour—the hour of final judgement—was at hand. He clung to Moses….But Moses withdrew himself gently <b>from</b> under <b>his</b> <b>shirt,</b> leaving it in Joshua’s hand”. This mysterious death of Moses is also asserted in Deuteronomy 34:5, “And Moses the servant of the LORD died there in Moab.” There is no explanation to why Moses may have died or why Moses may have been chosen to die: there is only this mysterious “disappearance.” According to Islamic tradition, Moses is buried at Maqam El-Nabi Musa, Jericho.|$|R
6000|$|... 'We {{went by the}} stars,' Seth said. 'It {{was easier}} {{than it would have}} been by day, for when the sun's right overhead, it ain't a very {{straightforward}} matter to know how you are going; but there would be no difficulty then to scouts like Rube and me. Well, we had run, may-be, an hour and a quarter when we heard a faint, short bark far behind. [...] "The brute is on our trail," [...] Rube said; [...] "they haven't given us so much start as I looked for. Another half hour and he will be at our heels sure enough." [...] I felt this was true, and felt very bad-like for a bit. In another quarter of an hour the bark was a good bit nearer, and we couldn't go no faster than we were going. All of a sudden I said to Rube, [...] "Rube, I've heard them dogs lose their smell if they taste blood. Let's try it; it's our only chance. Here, give me a cut in the arm, I can spare it better than you can; you lost a lot to-night from that cut." [...] We stopped a minute. I tore off the sleeve of my hunting shirt, and then Rube gave me a bit of a cut on the arm. I let the blood run till the sleeve was soaked and dripping, then Rube tore off a strip <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>shirt</b> and bandaged my arm up tight. We rolled the sleeve in a ball and threw it down, then took a turn, made a zigzag or two to puzzle the brute, and then went on our line again. For another ten minutes we could hear the barking get nearer and nearer, and then it stopped all of a sudden. On we went, and it was half an hour again before we heard it, and then it was a long way off. [...] "I expect we're all right now, Seth," [...] Rube said. [...] "I guess we are," [...] I said; [...] "but the sooner we strike water, the better I shall be pleased." [...] It was nigh another half hour, and we were both pretty nigh done, when we came upon the stream, and the dog couldn't have been more than a mile off. It was a bit of a thing five or six yards wide, and a foot or two deep in the middle. [...] "Which way?" [...] says Rube. [...] "Up's our nearest way, so we had better go down." [...] "No, no," [...] says I; [...] "they're sure to suspect that we shall try the wrong course to throw them off, so let's take the right." [...] Without another word up stream we went, as hard as we could run. In a few minutes we heard the dog stop barking, when we might have been half a mile up stream. [...] "We must get out of this, Rube," [...] I said. [...] "Whichever way they try with the dog, they are safe to send horsemen both ways." [...] "Which side shall we get out, Seth?" [...] "It don't matter," [...] I said; [...] "it's all a chance which side they take the dog. Let's take our own side." [...] Out we got; and we hadn't ran a quarter of a mile before we heard a tramping of horses coming along by the stream. We stopped to listen, for we knew if they had the dog with them, and if he was on our side of the river, we were as good as dead. [...] "If they take the trail, Seth," [...] Rube said, [...] "it's all up with us. Don't let's run any more. We are men enough to shoot the four first who come up, and I only hope one of them may be El Zeres; that'll leave us a pistol each, and we will keep them for ourselves. Better do that, by a long way, than be pulled to pieces with hot pinchers." [...] "A long way, Rube," [...] I said. [...] "That's agreed, then. When I give the word, put the barrel against your eye and fire; that's a pretty safe shot." [...] As the Mexicans got to the place where we had got out, we stopped and held our breath. There was no pause,--on they went; another minute, and we felt certain they had passed the spot. [...] "Saved, by thunder!" [...] Rube said; and we turned and went off at a steady trot that we could keep up for hours. [...] "How long shall we get, do you think, Seth?" [...] "That all depends how long they follow down stream. They can't tell how far we are ahead. I should think they will go two miles down; then they will cross the stream and come back; and if they don't happen to be on the right side of the stream as they pass where we got out, they will go up another two or three miles, and near as much down, before they strike the trail. We're pretty safe of half an hour's start, and we might get, if we're lucky, near an hour. We ain't safe yet, Rube, by a long way. It's near thirty miles from Pepita's to the camp. We've come sixteen of it good--eighteen I should say; we have got another twelve to the road, and we ain't safe then. No; our only chance is to come across a hacienda and get horses. There are a good many scattered about; but it's so dark, we might pass within fifty yards and not see it. There won't be a streak of daylight till four, and it ain't two yet." [...] "Not far off, Seth." [...] By this time we had got our wind again, and quickened up into a fast swing; but our work had told on us, and we couldn't have gone much over seven miles an hour. Several times, as we went on, we could hear a trampling in the dark, and knew that we had scared some horses; but though we had a lasso we had brought with us, we might as well have tried to catch a bird with it. In an hour we heard the dog again, but it was a long way behind. There was nothing for it now but hard running, and we were still seven miles from the road, and even that didn't mean safety. I began to think we were going to lose the race, after all. In another quarter of an hour we stopped suddenly. [...] "Thunder!" [...] said Rube; [...] "what's that?" [...] Some animal, that had been lying down, got up just in front of us. [...] "It's a horse! Your lasso, Rube!" [...] Rube, however, had made a tremendous rush forward, and, before the animal could stretch himself into a gallop, had got close, and grasped him by the mane. [...] "It's no go," [...] Rube said, as the horse made a step forward; [...] "he's an old un, dead lame." [...] "Don't leave go, Rube," [...] I said. [...] "He'll do for our turn." [...] He was a miserable old beast, but I felt that he would do as well as the best horse in the world for us. Rube saw my meaning, and in a minute we were both astride on his back. He tottered, and I thought he'd have gone down on his head. Kicking weren't of no good; so I out with my knife and gave him a prod, and off we went. It weren't far, some two hundred yards or so, but it was the way I wanted him, right across the line we were going. Then down he tumbled. [...] "All right," [...] said I. [...] "You've done your work, old man; but you mustn't lay here, or they may light upon you and guess what's been up." [...] So we lugged him on to his feet, gave him another prod, which sent him limping off; and on we went on our course, sure that we were at last safe, for we had thrown the bloodhound altogether off our trail. For a mile or so we kept right away from our course, for fear that they should keep straight on, and, missing the scent, lead the dog across the trail, and so pick it up again; then we turned and made straight for the road. [...] "I don't think, Rube," [...] I said after a while, [...] "that we shall strike the road far off where we left it at Pepita's." [...] "No, I expect not, Seth. We had better bear a little more to the south, for they will most likely make for Pepita's, and day will soon be breaking now." [...] "We'd better not strike the road at all, Rube; likely enough, they will follow it down for a few miles in hopes of picking us up." [...] "I hope they will," [...] Rube said; [...] "and I expect so. Won't it be a lark, just?" [...] "What do you mean, Rube?" [...] "Mean? Why, didn't the Cap tell us to leave San Miguel before daybreak, and to ride to meet him? It warn't likely that he meant us to ride more than ten miles or so; so that he will be within that distance of San Miguel by an hour after daybreak, and will be at Pepita's half an hour later. If them fellows ride on, they are safe to fall into as nice a trap as----" [...] "Jehoshophat!" [...] said I. [...] "You're right, Rube. Let's make tracks. It can't be more than another four or five miles to the road, and day will break in half an hour." [...] "How strong do you reckon them, Seth?" [...] "Fifty or sixty," [...] said I, [...] "by the regular sound of the horses." [...] "That's about what I guessed," [...] Rube said. [...] "There are forty of our chaps, and they will be fresh. We'll give 'em goss." ...|$|E

It did not stop there, as spinach could also give Popeye the skills and powers he needed, as in The Man on the Flying Trapeze, where it gave him acrobatic skills.
