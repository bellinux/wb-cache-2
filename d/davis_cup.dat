5|$|From 2010 to 2016, Canada {{competed in}} 16 <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> ties. Raonic {{represented}} Canada in 11 of those ties, missing five due to injury: Ecuador in 2011, Japan in 2014, Belgium in 2015, and France and Chile in 2016.

5|$|Furthermore, at ATP Masters 1000 tournaments, {{they are}} all in the top-10 list (since 1970). Djokovic and Nadal lead with a record 30 titles each, {{followed}} by Federer (27) and Murray (14). All four players have also played key roles in leading their countries to success in the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup.</b> Djokovic and Federer helped Serbia (2010) and Switzerland (2014), respectively, win the competition for the first time, while Nadal has won four <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> titles, and Murray helped end a drought of 79 years for Great Britain in <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> competition (2015).|$|E
5|$|In the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> final, Murray's {{victory over}} Ruben Bemelmans in {{straight}} sets pulled Great Britain {{level in the}} final after Kyle Edmund had lost the first singles rubber in five sets, played on indoor clay courts at Ghent. He then partnered his brother Jamie in a four-set victory over the pairing of Steve Darcis and David Goffin, before defeating Goffin again in the reverse singles on Sunday, thus ensuring a 3–1 victory for Great Britain, their first <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> title since 1936 and their tenth overall. Murray also became only the third person since the current <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> format was introduced to win all eight of his singles rubbers in a <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> season, after John McEnroe and Mats Wilander.|$|E
5|$|Paes {{started his}} <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> career in 1990 {{at the age}} of 16, when he partnered Zeeshan Ali in doubles to beat the Japanese team in a gruelling five-set encounter. He is {{considered}} one of the top <b>Davis</b> <b>cup</b> players for his country, with a record of 89–32 overall, as of July 2015. He played an important role in the Indian <b>Davis</b> <b>cup</b> team that reached the World Group from 1991–1998. He was part of the Indian <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> team that reached the semifinals of the 1993 <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> with wins against Switzerland and France, eventually losing to Australia. In singles, his major wins came against French duo of Arnaud Boetsch and Henri Leconte in Fréjus, France in 1993, Wayne Ferreira in 1994, and Goran Ivanišević in 1995 when India defeated Croatia, Jan Siemerink in 1995 to defeat Netherlands, and Jiří Novák in 1997.

In 2007, Leander has three wins (two doubles and one singles) and no losses in the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup.</b>|$|E
5|$|The 1974 <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> {{marked the}} first time that neither Australia or the United States won the final since 1936, as South Africa and India were the finalists. However, the final was not contested as the Indian team refused to travel to South Africa in protest at the South African government's {{apartheid}} policies. South Africa were awarded the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> on walkover. Sweden beat Czechoslovakia 3–2 the following year to become the first European nation since 1936 to win the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup.</b> The <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> underwent further reorganisation in 1981 when a 16 team World Group was introduced. The remaining nations were split into regional groups with promotion and relegation to and from the World Group.|$|E
5|$|Afterwards, Murray criticised {{the tournament}} {{schedule}} and {{cast doubt on}} his availability for next year's <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup.</b>|$|E
5|$|Federer holds many <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> {{records for}} Switzerland that {{includes}} most total wins, most singles wins and most years played.|$|E
5|$|Murray and Federer {{shared the}} two North American Hard Court Masters titles, at Montreal and Cincinnati respectively, with Djokovic being the losing finalist on both occasions. The US Open final was contested by Djokovic and Federer. Djokovic won in four sets, {{giving him a}} third slam title of the season. Murray led Great Britain to <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> victory in 2015, winning all eight of a {{possible}} eight singles rubbers and becoming the latest member of the quartet to win the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup.</b>|$|E
5|$|Murray {{pulled out}} of the match against Lithuania, so younger players could gain more {{international}} experience, and to allow him to focus on trying to win Grand Slam titles. His absence was criticised by <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> captain John Lloyd. The Lithuanian side entered the tie as underdogs; fielding a team of teenagers, but Lithuania won 3–2. This {{was the first time that}} Great Britain had lost five ties in a row and was described as a humiliating <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> defeat for Great Britain. It led to the resignation of John Lloyd as <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> captain, with Britain now threatened with relegation to the lowest tier of the competition.|$|E
5|$|Playing against Australia in {{the semifinals}} of the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> World Group in Glasgow, Murray won both his singles rubbers in {{straight}} sets, against Thanasi Kokkinakis and Bernard Tomic. He also partnered his brother Jamie, and they won in five sets against the pairing of Sam Groth and Lleyton Hewitt, the results guiding Great Britain to the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> final {{for the first time}} since 1978 with a 3–2 lead over Australia.|$|E
5|$|Vying for Argentina's first title, del Potro {{played in}} the 2016 <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> against Croatia. His first match was a four set victory against Ivo Karlović. Partnering Leonardo Mayer, del Potro lost in doubles against Ivan Dodig and Marin Cilic. 2–1 down in matches, del Potro played in singles against Cilic, coming back from 2 sets down {{for the first time}} in his career to win in five sets. Described as one of the best <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> comebacks ever, del Potro {{levelled}} the score at 2–2, paving the way for Federico Delbonis to complete the comeback by beating Ivo Karlović in straight sets, thus claiming Argentina's first ever <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> title.|$|E
5|$|After the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> tie Cochet only {{played in}} minor tournament and doubles matches. He won the singles in La Baule against Raymond Rodel and the mixed doubles in Vals-les-Bains. Rodel, Cochet, Jacques Brugnon and Pierre Henri Landry, {{representing}} the Racing Club de Paris, sailed to Japan {{for a series}} of friendly matches against the Japanese <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> team where Cochet suffered a surprise defeat against Takeichi Harada. They then visited India to face the Indian <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> team in a series of exhibitions. Cochet won all of his matches. In 1929 Cochet was ranked number one by several journals and journalists most notably by A Wallis Myers, Hungarian tennis magazine Tennisz és Golf, edited by Béla von Kehrling and on the list of rival Bill Tilden. Evidently he led the French rankings as well. In December he was inducted as Honorary Member to the U.S.L.T.A. in New York.|$|E
5|$|At the Dubai Tennis Championships, he {{defeated}} Novak Djokovic in the semifinals, {{and then}} defeated Tomáš Berdych {{in the final}} to win his sixth Dubai crown and his first title since Halle in 2013. Federer made the final at the Indian Wells Masters, but lost to Novak Djokovic in a final-set tiebreaker. At the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> quarterfinals, Federer won both of his singles rubbers against Kazakhstan, the second {{of which was the}} first live deciding rubber of his <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> career. Federer then took a wild card into the Monte-Carlo Masters defeating Novak Djokovic {{on his way to the}} finals, but lost to compatriot Stan Wawrinka in a tight final.|$|E
5|$|Del Potro {{played in}} the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> Final, with the title {{on the line and}} looking to fulfill his {{childhood}} dream. He lost in the second rubber to David Ferrer, despite being two sets to one up, eventually losing in a pulsating five-set contest in a match lasting over five hours. With his country down 2–1, del Potro needed to beat Rafael Nadal in the reverse singles to keep the tie going. Del Potro dominated the first set, but could not keep his level up and lost in four sets. For the third time in six years, Argentina lost in the finals of the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> World Group, this time 3–1.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{made his}} <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> for Switzerland {{debut in the}} World Group 1st Round against Italy in 1999 at 17 years of age. In his first match he {{defeated}} Davide Sanguinetti in four sets and recorded a second singles victory in a dead rubber two days later as Switzerland advanced to the World Group Quarterfinals. In the Quarterfinals Federer, who was still 17 years old, suffered his first <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> loss when he was defeated by Belgian Christophe Van Garsse in five sets. The Swiss team {{would go on to}} lose the rubber 3–2. A year later, Federer competed in his first <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> doubles rubber where he teamed with countryman Lorenzo Manta to defeat Australians Wayne Arthurs and Sandon Stolle in four sets. Despite the doubles victory, Federer lost both singles rubbers to Mark Philippoussis and Lleyton Hewitt which saw Switzerland sent to the World Group Playoffs {{for the first time in}} Federer's career. He would return for the playoffs in July 2000 and led Switzerland to a 5–0 win over Belarus by recording wins in singles and doubles.|$|E
5|$|He next {{headed to}} the United States {{to compete in the}} <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> World Group first round with Great Britain, who went into the tie as outsiders. Murray won both of his ties against Donald Young and Sam Querrey respectively, helping Britain to their first <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> quarterfinal since 1986. Murray's next tournament was the Rotterdam Open after {{receiving}} a late wild card, however he lost to Marin Čilić in straight sets in the quarterfinals. His following competition, the Mexican Open in Acapulco, ended in a semifinal defeat by Grigor Dimitrov in a thrilling three-setter that required two tiebreakers to decide the final two sets.|$|E
5|$|His first <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> {{highlight}} came in 2003 as {{the newly}} crowned Wimbledon champion led his country to an historic semifinal run. After recording five wins in ties against the Netherlands and France, the Swiss team traveled to Melbourne {{to play the}} highly rated Australians. Federer once again defeated Wimbledon runner-up Mark Philippoussis in the second rubber but allowed the Australians to lead the tie 2–1 going into Day 3 after dropping the doubles rubber in five sets. Federer then played Lleyton Hewitt in a sudden death situation for Switzerland and despite leading two sets to love, succumbed to a fast finishing Hewitt in five sets. Australia {{would go on to}} claim the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> title months later as Federer's interest in <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> began to wane and his focus shifted to his personal career. He would go on to skip many ties over the years but often competed in the World Group Playoffs each year in order for Switzerland to maintain their place in the top division.|$|E
5|$|In 1994, ranked No 143, he lost in {{the first}} round of a Challenger to No 208 Louis Gloria. Four weeks later, he beat World No. 13 Wayne Ferreira in {{straight}} sets in the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 2013 <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> World Group first round, Raonic won singles rubbers over Ramos-Viñolas and Guillermo García-López to lead Canada over top-seeded Spain. He {{repeated}} this feat with {{victories over}} Fabio Fognini and Seppi to help Canada defeat Italy in the quarterfinals, sending Canada into the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> semifinals {{for the first}} time since 1913. In the semifinal against Serbia, Raonic won his singles match over Tipsarević, but lost to world No. 1 Djokovic as Canada was eliminated. The defeat marked Raonic's first singles match against Djokovic.|$|E
5|$|Murray {{returned}} for the Europe/Africa Zone Group II tie versus Luxembourg. He beat Laurent Bram, a tennis coach, 6–0, 6–0, 6–0, {{the last time}} a Briton had achieved this score line in <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> was Alan Mills defeating Josef Offenheim in 1959, also against Luxembourg. Andy and Jamie Murray teamed up {{for the first time in}} <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> doubles for a straight sets win. In his second singles match, Andy then recorded a third straight sets victory, over world No. 81 Gilles Müller, with Great Britain eventually winning 4–1.|$|E
5|$|Sweden reached {{two more}} finals in 1988 and 1989 but lost both times to West Germany. The United States regained the title in 1990, but they lost 3–1 to France the {{following}} year. They regained the title a year later, {{but could not}} defend it in 1993 as Germany won. Sweden were victorious in 1994, and they won a further two Davis Cups in 1997 and 1998. Australia regained the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> in 1999, but they lost the following two finals to Spain and France respectively. Russia won their first <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> in 2002, before Australia regained the title the following year. Spain won the tournament {{for the second time}} in 2004, and would win a further three titles in 2008, 2009 and 2011. The Czech Republic won successive Davis Cups in 2012 and 2013, before Switzerland won their first title in 2014. Great Britain won their first <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> since 1936 when they beat Belgium 3–1.|$|E
5|$|The Indian duo has a 303–103 career record together. They have {{a higher}} success rate against various top teams. They have a <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> record of longest winning streak in doubles, with 24 {{straight}} wins.|$|E
5|$|The National Tennis Centre, which {{includes}} Aegon Arena, hosts various cultural, sporting and social events. Several <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> matches have been played there, including the 2005 <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> final. The city {{is represented in}} the top Slovak leagues in women's and men's basketball, women's handball and volleyball, and men's water polo. The Devín–Bratislava National run is the oldest athletic event in Slovakia, and the Bratislava City Marathon has been held annually since 2006. A race track is located in Petržalka, where horse racing and dog racing events and dog shows are held regularly.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of countryman Stanislas Wawrinka as a Grand Slam singles champion in 2014 renewed hope for Federer in his <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> quest, and the pair both committed to playing each tie that year. Their commitment would pay off as wins over Serbia, Kazakhstan and Italy allowed the Swiss team {{to advance to}} the 2014 <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> Final. Leading into the final, Federer was suffering from a back injury that threw serious doubt over Switzerland's chance to claim the title, and a second rubber straight sets loss to Gaël Monfils seemingly spelled the worst for Switzerland. However, a rejuvenated Federer returned the next day to help claim the doubles rubber, which set up a fourth rubber singles tie between Federer and Richard Gasquet. Federer defeated Gasquet in straight sets and in doing so handed Switzerland its first (and only to date) <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> title.|$|E
5|$|When {{asked to}} play for Argentina in the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup,</b> del Potro declined, arguing {{problems}} with {{the press and the}} team, and his decision to prioritize his personal career.|$|E
5|$|Del Potro was {{selected}} to play his first home-based <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> tie, between Argentina and Russia. He won his first singles match against Davydenko in three sets. He also won the fifth and deciding match against Igor Andreev in straight sets, booking Argentina {{a place in the}} final.|$|E
5|$|Despite his injury, Federer {{finished}} the season {{on a high}} by defeating Richard Gasquet to clinch the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> for Switzerland {{for the first time}} in its history. The final was held at the Stade Pierre-Mauroy in Lille, France attracting over 27,000 spectators per match; this broke attendance record for the highest ever officially-sanctioned competition tennis match.|$|E
5|$|Following the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup,</b> Murray's {{season was}} cut short by his {{decision}} to undergo surgery, in order {{to sort out the}} lower back problems that had caused him problems since {{the early stages of the}} previous season. After being forced to withdraw from the French Open in May, the injury flared up again during the US Open and later during the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> World Group Play-offs, Murray made the decision that surgery was the best way to sort the problem out for the long-term. Following the conclusion of the 2013 season, Murray was voted the 2013 BBC Sport Personality of the Year, after having been heavy favourite since the nominees were announced.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, ranked No 130, {{he managed}} to beat Croatia's World No 7 Goran Ivanišević (1992 and 1994 Wimbledon singles finalist) in a {{controversial}} five-setter on grass. Jan Siemerink, in 1996, then ranked No. 20, also fell to Paes in the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup.</b>|$|E
5|$|In March, Murray {{split with}} coach Ivan Lendl, {{who had been}} widely praised for helping Murray achieve his goal of winning Grand Slam titles. At the 2014 Miami Masters, Murray {{defeated}} Matthew Ebden, Feliciano López and Jo Wilfried Tsonga but lost to Djokovic in the quarterfinals. In the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> quarterfinals against Italy, he beat Andreas Seppi in his first rubber, then teamed up with Colin Fleming to win the doubles rubber. Murray had only beaten one top ten player on clay, Nikolay Davydenko, back in 2009, and so in his final singles match, was stunned by Fabio Fognini in straight sets, which took Great Britain to the deciding final rubber. However, in this match his compatriot, James Ward was defeated by Andreas Seppi, also in straight sets, knocking Murray and Great Britain out of the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup.</b>|$|E
5|$|In September 2004, {{he won the}} Junior US Open and was {{selected}} for the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> World Group play-off match against Austria later that month; however, he was not selected to play. Later that year, he won BBC Young Sports Personality of the Year.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} against Belgium in Ghent, Murray beat Ruben Bemelmans and {{combined}} with brother Jamie {{to win the}} doubles rubber before defeating David Goffin to win the <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> for Great Britain, 79 years after the national team's last win.|$|E
5|$|Murray is the men's singles 2012 and 2016 Olympic gold medallist, {{making him}} the only tennis player, male or female, to have won two Olympic singles titles. He {{featured}} in Great Britain's Davis Cup-winning team in 2015, going 11–0 in his matches (8 singles and 3 doubles) as they secured their first <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> title since 1936.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> {{was founded}} in 1900 as the International Lawn Tennis Challenge. Four members of Harvard University wished to {{challenge}} Great Britain in a tennis competition. One of the American players, Dwight F. Davis, designed a tournament format and ordered a sterling silver trophy from Shreve, Crump & Low for approximately $1,000. The first match, held at Longwood Cricket Club in Boston, Massachusetts, was won by the American team 3–0. There was no match the following year, but the United States retained the trophy in 1902, beating Great Britain 3–2. This was followed by four successive victories for Britain, from 1903 to 1906. The 1904 <b>Davis</b> <b>Cup</b> saw new teams compete for the first time, as Belgium and France entered.|$|E
