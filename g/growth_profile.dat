There are {{a wide variety of}} materials that can be deposited by LbL including polyions, metals, ceramics, nanoparticles, and biological molecules. Another important quality of LbL is the high degree of control over thickness, which arises due to the variable <b>growth</b> <b>profile</b> of the films, which directly correlates to the materials used, the number of bilayers, and the assembly technique. By the fact that each bilayer can be as thin as 1 nm, this method offers easy control over the thickness with 1 nm resolution.|$|E

As wealth inequality grows, polarizing the rich and poor and creating social conflict, the state can prioritize growth or protectionism. Protectionist and aggressive nationalist policies will only accentuate wealth inequality so therefore States have {{no option but to}} prioritize growth. The challenge of the growth formulation will be to capitalize each citizen and guarantee their access to technology {{while at the same time}} managing the ecological ad technological risks that will inevitably result. The necessity of this growth formulation to avert the deterioration of geopolitical and geoeconomic conditions means that the State must become more important not less, according to this new <b>growth</b> <b>profile.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{etiology}} of AIS remains unclear, thus various hypotheses concerning its pathomechanism have been proposed. To date, biomechanical modeling {{has not been}} used to thoroughly study {{the influence of the}} abnormal <b>growth</b> <b>profile</b> (i. e., the growth rate of the vertebral body during the growth period) on the pathomechanism of curve progression in AIS. This study investigated the hypothesis that AIS progression is associated with the abnormal growth profiles of the anterior column of the spine. Methods A finite element model of the spinal column including growth dynamics was utilized. The initial geometric models were constructed from the bi-planar radiographs of a normal subject. Based on this model, five other geometric models were generated to emulate different coronal and sagittal curves. The detailed modeling integrated vertebral body growth plates and growth modulation spinal biomechanics. Ten years of spinal growth was simulated using AIS and normal growth profiles. Sequential measures of spinal alignments were compared. Results (1) Given the initial lateral deformity, the AIS <b>growth</b> <b>profile</b> induced a significant Cobb angle increase, which was roughly between three to five times larger compared to measures utilizing a normal <b>growth</b> <b>profile.</b> (2) Lateral deformities were absent in the models containing no initial coronal curvature. (3) The presence of a smaller kyphosis did not produce an increase lateral deformity on its own. (4) Significant reduction of the kyphosis was found in simulation results of AIS but not when using the <b>growth</b> <b>profile</b> of normal subjects. Conclusion Results from this analysis suggest that accelerated growth profiles may encourage supplementary scoliotic progression and, thus, may pose as a progressive risk factor. </p...|$|E

In experiment 2 (n = 748, initial weight 243 ± 30 g) fish were held in fifteen groups and had either free or restricted access to diets with three lipid levels.

Its commercial cultivation process is often performed on wheat straw and animal manure based compost that mainly contains lignocellulosic material as a source of carbon and nutrients for the mushroom production. As a large portion of compost carbohydrates are left unused in the current mushroom cultivation process, the aim of this work was to study wild-type A. bisporus strains for their potential to convert the components that are poorly utilized by the commercial strain A 15.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe rising {{number of}} novel {{pathogens}} threatening {{the human population}} has motivated the application of mathematical modeling for forecasting the trajectory and size of epidemics. Materials and methodsWe summarize the real-time forecasting results of the logistic equation during the 2015 Ebola challenge focused on predicting synthetic data derived from a detailed individual-based model of Ebola transmission dynamics and control. We also carry out a post-challenge comparison of two simple phenomenological models. In particular, we systematically compare the logistic growth model and a recently introduced generalized Richards model (GRM) that captures a range of early epidemic <b>growth</b> <b>profiles</b> ranging from sub-exponential to exponential growth. Specifically, we assess the performance of each model for estimating the reproduction number, generate short-term forecasts of the epidemic trajectory, and predict the final epidemic size. ResultsDuring the challenge the logistic equation consistently underestimated the final epidemic size, peak timing {{and the number of}} cases at peak timing with an average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 0. 49, 0. 36 and 0. 40, respectively. Post-challenge, the GRM which has the flexibility to reproduce a range of epidemic <b>growth</b> <b>profiles</b> ranging from early sub-exponential to exponential growth dynamics outperformed the logistic growth model in ascertaining the final epidemic size as more incidence data was made available, while the logistic model underestimated the final epidemic even with an increasing amount of data of the evolving epidemic. Incidence forecasts provided by the generalized Richards model performed better across all scenarios and time points than the logistic growth model with mean RMS decreasing from 78. 00 (logistic) to 60. 80 (GRM). Both models provided reasonable predictions of the effective reproduction number, but the GRM slightly outperformed the logistic growth model with a MAPE of 0. 08 compared to 0. 10, averaged across all scenarios and time points. ConclusionsOur findings further support the consideration of transmission models that incorporate flexible early epidemic <b>growth</b> <b>profiles</b> in the forecasting toolkit. Such models are particularly useful for quickly evaluating a developing infectious disease outbreak using only case incidence time series of the early phase of an infectious disease outbreak...|$|R
