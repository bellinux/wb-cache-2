5000|$|One {{might wonder}} what effect this {{interpretation}} of the Law of Contraposition has on Hempel's paradox of confirmation.

5000|$|This {{result would}} confirm the assertion, [...] "Whatever does not burn yellow is not sodium salt", and consequently, {{by virtue of}} the <b>equivalence</b> <b>condition,</b> it would confirm the {{original}} formulation. Why does this impress us as paradoxical? The reason becomes clear when we compare the previous situation with the case of an experiment where an object whose chemical constitution is as yet unknown to us is held into a flame and fails to turn it yellow, and where subsequent analysis reveals it to contain no sodium salt. This outcome, we should no doubt agree, is what was to be expected {{on the basis of the}} hypothesis ... thus the data here obtained constitute confirming evidence for the hypothesis. ...In the seemingly paradoxical cases of confirmation, we are often not actually judging the relation of the given evidence, E alone to the hypothesis H ... we tacitly introduce a comparison of H with a body of evidence which consists of E in conjunction with an additional amount of information which we happen to have at our disposal; in our illustration, this information includes the knowledge (1) that the substance used in the experiment is ice, and (2) that ice contains no sodium salt. If we assume this additional information as given, then, of course, the outcome of the experiment can add no strength to the hypothesis under consideration. But if we are careful to avoid this tacit reference to additional knowledge ... the paradoxes vanish.|$|E

40|$|A {{complete}} set of <b>equivalence</b> <b>conditions,</b> relating the mass-lumped Bubnov-Galerkin finite element (FE) scheme for Lagrangian linear elements to node-centred finite volume (FV) schemes, is derived {{for the first time}} for conservation laws in a three-dimensional cylindrical reference. <b>Equivalence</b> <b>conditions</b> are used to devise a class of FV schemes, in which all grid-dependent quantities are defined in terms of FE integrals. Moreover, all relevant differential operators in the FV framework are consistent with their FE counterparts, thus opening the way to the development of consistent hybrid FV/FE schemes for conservation laws in a three-dimensional cylindrical coordinate system. The two-dimensional schemes for the polar and the axisymmetrical cases are also explicitly derived. Numerical experiments for compressible unsteady flows, including expanding and converging shock problems and the interaction of a converging shock waves with obstacles, are carried out using the new approach. The results agree fairly well with one-dimensional simulations and simplified models...|$|R

40|$|Power {{regulation}} of horizontal-axis grid-connected up-wind constant-speed pitch-regulated wind turbines presents a demanding control {{problem with the}} plant, actuation system and control objectives all strongly nonlinear. In this paper, a novel nonlinear control strategy is devised which, in some sense, optimises performance across the operating envelope. In comparison with linear control, the nonlinear strategy achieves a substantial improvement in performance. The realisation adopted is crucial in attaining the required performance. An extended local linear <b>equivalence</b> <b>condition</b> is introduced which provides {{a basis for the}} selection of an appropriate realisation. This is an important, and general, issue in the design of gainscheduled systems and generic realisations, which satsify the extended local linear <b>equivalence</b> <b>condition,</b> are derived for SISO systems scheduled upon an internal plant or controller variable. For the wind turbine nonlinear controller, realisations which satisfy the extended local linear <b>equivalence</b> <b>condition</b> provide a substantial improvement in performance in comparison to linear control and realisations which do not satisfy this condition...|$|E
