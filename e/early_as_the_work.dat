50|$|There are two {{generally}} recognized senses {{of the term}} Sino-Christian theology. In the broad sense, {{it belongs to the}} tradition of indigenous theology which stretches <b>as</b> <b>early</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> during <b>the</b> time of the Jesuit China missions, until the present day. However, these indigenizing efforts are often critiqued for a lacking in their assessments of traditional Chinese culture, particularly as found in Confucianism. In the narrow sense of the term, Sino-Christian theology is associated with cultural Christians like Liu Xiaofeng and He Guanghu who have challenged the indigenizing approach and have proposed the greater need to articulate a critically reflective theology using the Chinese language.|$|R
5000|$|Pithos has two irreconcilable derivations, {{classical}} and Mycenaean. On the one hand, {{it was a}} well-used word of the Iron Age in Greece, dating to <b>as</b> <b>early</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> of Homer. Julius Pokorny and other professional linguists developed a derivation from Proto-Indo European *bhidh-, [...] "container", that followed all the rules of language change and moreover was related to Latin fiscus, [...] "purse", from which English obtains [...] "fiscal". Regardless of the real derivation, a pithos certainly {{seems to be a}} large purse containing economic goods in quantity. The derivation would have been elegant, tracing fiscality back to prehistoric Greece, it was thought, taking its place with oikos, [...] "house", the origin word for economic, and others. At that time Greek and Latin were believed to have had a common ancestor other than Proto-Indo-European.|$|R
50|$|Although the German {{translation}} which Schubert used {{has been}} attributed to August Schlegel (apparently on the basis of various editions of Cymbeline bearing his name published in Vienna in 1825 and 1826), the text is not exactly <b>the</b> same <b>as</b> <b>the</b> one which Schubert set: and this particular adaptation of Shakespeare had already been published <b>as</b> <b>early</b> <b>as</b> 1810 <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>work</b> of , and again — under the joint names of A.

50|$|Along with written speech, the Greeks {{commenced}} studying grammatical {{and philosophical}} issues. A philosophical {{discussion about the}} nature and origins of language can be found <b>as</b> <b>early</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> of Plato. A subject of concern was whether language was man-made, a social artifact, or supernatural in origin. Plato in his Cratylus presents the naturalistic view, that word meanings emerge from a natural process, independent of the language user. His arguments are partly based on examples of compounding, where the meaning of the whole is usually related to the constituents, although by the end he admits a small role for convention. The sophists and Socrates introduced dialectics as a new text genre. The Platonic dialogs contain definitions of the meters of the poems and tragedy, the form and the structure of those texts (see the Republic and Phaidros, Ion, etc.).|$|R
50|$|In {{tropical}} Africa of the continent's center, {{the technique}} of lost-wax casting was developed <b>early,</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> from Benin show. When a king died, his successor would order that a bronze head be made of his predecessor. Approximately 170 of these sculptures exist, and the oldest date from the twelfth century. The Oba, or king, monopolized the materials that were most difficult to obtain, such as gold, elephant tusks, and bronze. These kings made possible {{the creation of the}} splendid Benin bronzes; thus, the royal courts contributed substantially to the development of sub-Saharan art. In 1939, heads very {{similar to those of the}} Benin Empire were discovered in Ife, the holy city of the Yoruba, which dated to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. This discovery supported an earlier tradition holding that it was artists from Ife who had taught Benin the techniques of bronze metalworking. Recognition of the antiquity of the technology in Benin advanced when these sculptures were dated definitively to that era.|$|R

5000|$|It {{eventually}} {{earned the}} name [...] "shinpa" [...] (literally meaning [...] "new school") to contrast it from [...] "kyūha" [...] ("old school" [...] or kabuki) due its more contemporary and realistic stories. With {{the success of}} the Seibidan troupe, however, shinpa theater ended up with a form that was closer to kabuki than to the later shingeki because of its continued use of onnagata and off-stage music. As a theatrical form, it was most successful in <b>the</b> <b>early</b> 1900s <b>as</b> <b>the</b> <b>works</b> of novelists such as Kyōka Izumi, Kōyō Ozaki, and Roka Tokutomi were adapted for the stage.

25|$|The formal psychometric {{measurement}} of creativity, {{from the standpoint}} of orthodox psychological literature, is usually considered to have begun with J. P.

Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to IQ-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.|$|R

50|$|The lack of {{opportunity}} in the South prompted many African Americans to migrate to Western cities in search {{of jobs in the}} booming munitions industry. Once they arrived, they were met with a variety of factors that separated emerging migrant communities from white ones. This urban spatial segregation {{led to the creation of}} racially homogeneous areas in cities that saw large amounts of African American immigration, such <b>as</b> <b>the</b> San Francisco Bay and Los Angeles. It is estimated that less than 1% of Los Angeles's 461,000 black residents lived in communities without a black majority in 1960, resulting in de facto segregation. In order to exploit the poor financial situation many migrants were in, areas of low income housing were established in places city planners wanted them to live. For example, South Los Angeles was established as a designated area for African Americans <b>as</b> <b>early</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> 1930s. <b>Working</b> class blacks were attracted by the low price of housing intentionally placed in order to encourage the concentration of blacks and Latinos away from whites. Freeways were often built with the isolation of racial communities in mind. They served to reinforce lines of segregation and further contributed to the isolation of racially homogeneous communities in racially diverse cities. The fear of racially motivated violence and discrimination also served to isolate communities of minorities as they sought collective security and nondiscriminatory treatment close to home. The limited amount of housing, combined with the upsurge of immigrants during the Second Great Migration lead to severe overcrowding and housing shortages that contributed to increasingly low property values.|$|R
