500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews {{with one}} detractor. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an [...] "A–" [...] {{and called it}} his [...] "favorite episode of season seven" [...] and that he wished that [...] "it had been the series finale" [...] for The X-Files. VanDerWerff argued that the episode possessed a [...] "warmth and tenderness" [...] that was missing from the following two seasons, after Duchovny left the series as a full-time star. He concluded that [...] "the genius of 'Je Souhaite' lies in how it embraces the inherent weirdness of the world this show is set in." [...] Rob Bricken from Topless Robot named [...] "Je Souhaite" [...] the second most funny X-Files episode, writing, [...] "Best line: When Scully, ever the skeptic, begins trying to rationalize her examination of an invisible body, Mulder replies with an exasperated, 'Oh!' It's {{what most of us}} had been thinking <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>about</b> Scully's refusal to acknowledge all the strange crap she had seen." ...|$|E
500|$|Adeline Hulot, on {{the other}} hand, is mercy personified. Like her cousin Bette, she comes from a peasant background, but has internalized the ideals of 19th-century womanhood, {{including}} devotion, grace, and deference. She reveals in the first scene that she has known <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>about</b> her husband's infidelities, but refuses to condemn him. Adeline's forgiving nature is often considered a significant character flaw. Some suggest that she is partly to blame for Hulot's wandering affection. C.A. Prendergast, for example, calls her forgiveness [...] "an inadequate and even positively disastrous response" [...] to her situation. He further suggests that Adeline, by choosing the role of quiet and dutiful wife, has excised from herself the erotic power to which the Baron is drawn. [...] "ne could {{at the very least}} offer the tentative speculation that Hulot's obsessional debauchery is in part the result of a certain poverty in Adeline, that the terrible logic of Hulot's excess is partially shaped by a crucial deficiency in his wife." [...] Others are less accusatory; Adeline's nearly infinite mercy, they say, is evidence of foolishness. Critic Herbert J. Hunt declares that she shows [...] "more imbecility than Christian patience", and David Bellos points out that, like her husband, she is driven by passion– albeit of a different kind: [...] "Adeline's desire (for good, for the family, for Hector, for God) is so radically different from the motivating desires of the other characters that she seems in their context to be without desire..." ...|$|E

500|$|Reviews of {{the episode}} by {{television}} critics were positive, with Kevin McFarland of The A.V. Club calling it [...] "an episode of Family Guy that rewards every viewer who liked the show in the past." [...] McFarland also gave high praise to the episode, writing, [...] "At first, I was simply pleased that 'Back to the Pilot' didn't screw things up at the beginning, but as the episode went, I kept looking at the clock and being amazed that it hadn't dropped the ball yet. It used short cutaways and a plethora of self-referential jokes the writers must have stockpiled <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>about</b> the animation quality, voice quality, {{and structure of the}} pilot to every possible advantage." [...] He continued, [...] "It wasn't perfect {{by any stretch of the}} imagination, and it's not on the same level as the occasional brilliance that South Park reaches on about one occasion per season nowadays, but it's the most fun I've had watching the show that didn't involve a Star Wars parody in many years." [...] McFarland concluded his review by giving the episode a grade of A-. Kate Moon of TV Fanatic also enjoyed the episode, noting, [...] "'Back to the Pilot' was a great meta episode of Family Guy. From poking fun at its own flaws in the original series to acknowledging how silly the cutaway gags can be, Family Guy shone at its layered best tonight." [...] She continued, [...] "Treating its animated characters like real actors was a nice touch as well. [...] Watching the original family showed how much the characters evolved and changed throughout the series' long run." [...] Moon concluded her review by giving the episode a 4.2 out of 5. Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number two on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and described the episode as [...] "pure genius". He added, [...] "Not only was the episode hilarious with amazing Brian and Stewie moments, but it was genuinely quite clever in the time-travel stakes, which is impressive on a nerd level." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1886, Van Gogh {{left the}} Netherlands and {{traveled}} to Paris to explore emerging artistic movements {{under the guidance}} and continued support of his brother Theo van Gogh, an art dealer. Surprised that Vincent had come to Paris unannounced, and in opposition to their conversations about timing of his arrival, Vincent stayed in Theo's apartment on Rue Laval until a larger apartment could be acquired. For four months, Van Gogh studied with Fernand Cormon, painting plaster casts, live nude models and props available at Cormon's studio. [...] Cormon also encouraged open-air painting. [...] There me met Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec, Émile Bernard, and Louis Anquetin. Through Theo and artistic social circles he also met Edgar Degas, Camille Pissarro, Paul Signac, Georges Seurat, and Paul Gauguin. [...] Through the fellowship with these men, he was introduced to Impressionists, Symbolists, Pointillists, and Japanese art, Ukiyo-e, and woodcut prints. In spite of his unusual manner, disheveled clothes and often time frightening manner, Paris was the one place where Van Gogh developed friendships with other artists. [...] So much so that when Toulouse-Lautrec heard disparaging remarks against Van Gogh, he challenged the man to a duel. Seeing and trading artwork with the Parisian avant-garde artists, Van Gogh understood what Theo {{had been trying to}} tell him <b>for</b> <b>years</b> <b>about</b> modern art. He was able to experiment with each of the movements to develop his own style, becoming what some say is [...] "one of the most important artists in modern art." ...|$|E
