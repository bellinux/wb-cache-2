5|$|Tessellations {{in three}} or more {{dimensions}} are called <b>honeycombs.</b> In three dimensions there is just one regular honeycomb, which has eight cubes at each polyhedron vertex. Similarly, in three dimensions there is just one quasiregular honeycomb, which has eight tetrahedra and six octahedra at each polyhedron vertex. However, there are many possible semiregular <b>honeycombs</b> in three dimensions. Uniform polyhedra can be constructed using the Wythoff construction.|$|E
5|$|A uniform {{honeycomb}} in hyperbolic {{space is}} a uniform tessellation of uniform polyhedral cells. In 3-dimensional hyperbolic space {{there are nine}} Coxeter group families of compact convex uniform <b>honeycombs,</b> generated as Wythoff constructions, and represented by permutations of rings of the Coxeter diagrams for each family.|$|E
5|$|A real {{physical}} tessellation is a tiling made {{of materials}} such as cemented ceramic squares or hexagons. Such tilings may be decorative patterns, or may have functions such as providing durable and water-resistant pavement, floor or wall coverings. Historically, tessellations were used in Ancient Rome and in Islamic art {{such as in the}} decorative geometric tiling of the Alhambra palace. In the twentieth century, the work of M. C. Escher often made use of tessellations, both in ordinary Euclidean geometry and in hyperbolic geometry, for artistic effect. Tessellations are sometimes employed for decorative effect in quilting. Tessellations form a class of patterns in nature, for example in the arrays of hexagonal cells found in <b>honeycombs.</b>|$|E

5|$|Each {{level is}} {{composed}} {{of a number of}} challenges that involve solving puzzles, jumping over obstacles, gathering objects, and defeating opponents. The game also features some elements of action-adventure games. Players often have to speak with NPCs and then {{figure out a way to}} help them. It is also possible to increase Banjo and Kazooie's energy bar by collecting extra <b>honeycombs</b> that are hidden throughout the levels. Banjo and Kazooie can perform a wide range of abilities, such as jumping, climbing, swimming, flying, and rolling into enemies. Most of these moves are learned by finding Bottles, a friendly mole, inside the worlds. Some moves require specific items so that they can be performed. For instance, red feathers allow Banjo and Kazooie to fly, while gold feathers protect them from damage. Some items also allow the character to gain temporary abilities in a particular moment. For instance, the turbo trainers provide a speed burst to reach a certain destination on time.|$|E
5|$|By N42 and S89 the equestrian parade {{is at an}} end, and the {{following}} 16 figures on the north and 18 on the south are taken to be the elders of Athens judging by their braided hair, an attribute of distinguished age in Classical art. Four of these figures raise their right hand in a clenched fist gesture suggestive of a pose associated with the thallophoroi (olive branch bearers) who were older men chosen in competition for their good looks alone. No drill holes, however, exist for any branch to be inserted in their hands. Next in line (S107–114, N20–28) are the musicians: four kithara (a variant of the lyre) and four aulos (flute) players. N16–19 and S115–118 (conjectured) perhaps, as hydriaphoroi, the water-vessel carriers, here men, rather than metic girls mentioned {{in the literature on}} the Panathenaia. N13–15, S119–121 are the skaphephoroi, the tray bearers of the <b>honeycombs</b> and cakes used to entice the sacrificial animals to the altar. N1–12, S122–149 are the four cows and four sheep on the north and ten cows on the south meant for sacrifice on the acropolis, presumably an abbreviated form of the hecatomb usually offered on this occasion – there is an a-b-a rhythm of placid and restive cows.|$|E
