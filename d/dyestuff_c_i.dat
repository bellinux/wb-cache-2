The potentiometric titration experiment is used to investigate acid-base properties of the sediment surface with a constant capacitance surface complexation model. The parameters controlling the sorption such as solution pH and ion strength, as well as the influence of organic carbon and Ca 2 + ion on the adsorption, are evaluated. It is shown that the titration data can be successfully described by the surface protonation and deprotonation model with the least-squares FITEQL program 2. 0. The sorption isotherm data are fitted to the Freundlich equation in a nonlinear form (1 /n = 0. 3 - 0. 9) for all tested dyes. With increasing pH value, the sorption of <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Mordant Black 11 and <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Direct Blue 86 on the sediment decreases, while for <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Basic Yellow X- 5 GL and <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Basic Red 13, the extent of sorption slightly increases. In addition, ion strength also exhibits a considerably different effect on the sorption behavior of these dye compounds. The addition of Ca 2 + can greatly reduce the sorption of <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Basic Red 13 on the sediment surface, while it enhances the sorption of <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Direct Blue 6.

A correspondence is established between <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 0 -ideals and a certain kind of matrices which we call x-nice, and a chain of <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 0 -ideals corresponds to a factorization of some x-nice matrix. When the local ring A itself is a complete intersection of dimension zero, a <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 0 -ideal is necessarily of the form (0 :bA) for some b∈ A. Some criteria are provided to recognize whether an ideal (0 :bA) is <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 0 or not. When y is a minimal generator of the maximal ideal of A, it is also proved that the ideals yA and (0 :yA) are <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 0 simultaneously and that this is the case exactly when the ideal (0 :yA) is principal. These <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 0 -ideals of the form (0 :yA), y being a minimal generator of the maximal ideal, are investigated.

For the VO defects, it is established that the doping with Ge affects the thermal stability of VO (830 cm - 1) defects {{as well as their}} fraction converted to VO 2 (888 cm - 1) defects. In Ge-free samples containing carbon, it was found that carbon impurity atoms do not affect the thermal stability of VO defects, although they affect the fraction of VO defects that is converted to VO 2 complexes. Considering the oxygen-carbon complexes, it is established that the annealing of the 862 cm - 1 band associated with the <b>C</b> <b>i</b> O i defects is accompanied with the emergence of the 1048 cm - 1 band, which has earlier been assigned to the C s O 2 i center.

A Bibliographic and Documentary Exploratory Research was conducted based on safety and efficacy data contained in scientific studies and legal documents. The study showed that the creation of ANVISA was necessary because no resolution had been published about the safety and efficacy of cosmetics for the <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> before ANVISA. However, the challenges faced by the <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> may have had a negative impact on the health of consumers. Finally, it was concluded that the actions before ANVISA were insufficient to the <b>C.</b> <b>I</b> [...] Thus, the creation of ANVISA was essential to have a regulatory basis fot the <b>C.</b> <b>I...</b>|$|R

Accordingly, the polyester woven samples were dyed with <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Disperse Yellow 160, <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Disperse Red 77 and <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Disperse Blue 79 : 1, and the cotton woven samples were dyed with <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Reactive Yellow 176, <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Reactive Red 239 and <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Reactive Blue 221. The effluents of the dyeings with these dyes and also with their mixtures were decolorized by ozone gas. The colours of the samples dyed with the decolorized effluents were compared with the original dyeings (standards) and the colour differences were calculated. Under the experimental conditions of this investigation, the many of the dyeing effluents were decolorized successfully, except the effluent of <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> Disperse Red 77. In the case that this red disperse dye present in the dyebath, the decolorized effluent had a slight reddish colour. The colour differences between the original dyeing (standard) and the samples dyed with the decolorized effluent are mostly below the tolerance (DE< 1) or slightly above the tolerance. The solid colours and uniform dyeings were achieved in the dyeings. The method seems promising in decreasing {{the amount of water}} used in textile dyeings...|$|R

40|$|The Roma population, one of {{the largest}} {{minority}} groups in Europe, experience discrimination and stigma associated with marginalized social position. Few studies have examined mental illnesses in the Roma, and none have examined the Roma children. The present study estimates mental health and behavioral disorders among Roma children in comparison to non-Roma children in educational institutions. Data were drawn from the School Children Mental Health Study in Europe (SCHME) study in Romania (Roma children identified by parent report, N[*]=[*] 70; non-Roma, N[*]=[*] 925) and Bulgaria (Roma children identified by exclusively-Roma schools, N[*]=[*] 65; non-Roma, N[*]=[*] 1312). The Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire was given to the parents and teachers to measure child mental health; children reported on their mental health through the Dominique Interactive. Control covariates included child sex and age, and parental characteristics when parent reports were available. Based on the child’s own report, Roma children had a higher odds of any internalizing disorder (OR[*]=[*] 2. 99, 95 % <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 2. 07 – 4. 30), phobias (OR[*]=[*] 4. 84, 95 % <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 3. 19 – 7. 35), separation anxiety disorder (OR[*]=[*] 2. 54, 95 % <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 1. 72 – 3. 76), generalized anxiety disorder (OR[*]=[*] 2. 95, 95 % <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 1. 75 – 4. 96), and major depressive disorder (OR[*]=[*] 3. 86, 95 % <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 2. 31 – 6. 37). Further Roma children had a higher odds of any externalizing disorder (OR[*]=[*] 2. 84, 95 % <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 1. 78 – 4. 54), oppositional defiant disorder (OR[*]=[*] 3. 35, 95 % <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 1. 93 – 5. 82), ADHD (OR[*]=[*] 2. 37, 95 % <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 1. 26 – 4. 46), and conduct disorder (OR[*]=[*] 3. 63, 95 % <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 2. 04 – 6. 46). Based on the report of teachers, Roma children had higher odds of emotional problems (OR[*]=[*] 2. 03, 95 % <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 1. 20 - 3. 44), peer-relational problems (OR[*]=[*] 2. 76, 95 % <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 1. 73 - 4. 41) and prosocial behavior (OR[*]=[*] 2. 75, 95 % <b>C.</b> <b>I.</b> 1. 75 - 4. 33). Roma children experience a higher burden of mental health problems compared with their non-Roma counterparts. Attention to child health and mental health among the Roma is urgently needed, as these children experience a constellation of health problems associated with poverty as well as experiences of stigma and discrimination...|$|R
