25|$|Since Le Sage's {{particles}} must lose speed when {{colliding with}} ordinary matter (in {{order to produce}} a net gravitational force), {{a huge amount of}} energy must be converted to internal energy modes. If those particles have no internal energy modes, the excess energy can only be absorbed by ordinary matter. Addressing this problem, Armand Jean Leray proposed a particle model (perfectly similar to Le Sage's) in which he asserted that the absorbed energy is used by the bodies to produce magnetism and heat. He suggested, that this might be an answer <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of where the energy output of the stars comes from.|$|E

2500|$|Scholars {{describe}} this philosophy as {{built on the}} foundation of non-dualism speculations in Upanishads, and term it as [...] "Advaitic Theism". The term combines the seemingly contradictory beliefs of a personal God that can be worshiped with a God that is immanent in creation and in one's own self. God in this philosophy is within, is not different from the individual self, states Daniel Sheridan, and transcends the limitations of specificity and temporality. He describes Advaitic Theism as a [...] "both/and" [...] solution <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of whether God is transcendent or immanent in relation to creation, where God is identical with Self and the Universe, and credits the Bhāgavata with a [...] "truly creative religious moment" [...] for introducing this philosophy. The text suggests that God Vishnu and the soul (Atman) in all beings is one.|$|E
2500|$|The IAEA has {{consistently}} stated it {{is unable to}} conclude that Iran's nuclear program is entirely peaceful. Such a conclusion would normally be drawn only for countries that have an Additional Protocol in force. [...] Iran ceased its implementation of the Additional Protocol in 2006, and also ceased all other cooperation with the IAEA beyond what Iran acknowledges it is required to provide under its safeguards agreement, after the IAEA Board of Governors decided, in February 2006, to report Iran's safeguards non-compliance to the UN Security Council. The UN Security Council, invoking ChapterVII of the UN Charter, then passed Resolution 1737, which obligated Iran to implement the Additional Protocol. Iran responded that its nuclear activities were peaceful and that Security Council involvement was malicious and unlawful. In August 2007, Iran and the IAEA entered into an agreement on the modalities for resolving remaining outstanding issues, and made progress in outstanding issues except <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> of [...] "alleged studies" [...] of weaponization by Iran. Iran says it {{did not address the}} alleged studies in the IAEA work plan because they {{were not included in the}} plan. The IAEA has not detected the actual use of nuclear material in connection with the alleged studies and says it regrets it is unable to provide Iran with copies of the documentation concerning the alleged studies, but says the documentation is comprehensive and detailed so that it needs to be taken seriously. Iran says the allegations are based on [...] "forged" [...] documents and [...] "fabricated" [...] data, and that it has not received copies of the documentation to enable it to prove that they were forged and fabricated.|$|E
2500|$|The {{impossibility of}} {{answering}} truly {{the question whether}} the 100th (or 10,000th) decimal {{in the evaluation of}} Pi is or is not a 9, splendidly illustrates how impossible it is to predicate truth in abstraction from actual knowing and actual purpose. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>question</b> cannot be answered until the decimal is calculated. Until then no one knows what it is, or rather will turn out to be. And no one will calculate it, until it serves some purpose to do so, and some one therefore interests himself in the calculation. And so until then the truth remains uncertain: there is no 'true' answer, because there is no actual context in which the question has really been raised. We have merely a number of conflicting possibilities, not even claims to truth, and there is no decision. Yet a decision is possible if an experiment is performed. But his experiment presupposes a desire to know. It will only be made if the point becomes one which it is practically important to decide. Normally no doubt it does not become such, because for the actual purposes of the sciences it makes no difference whether we suppose the figure to be 9 or something else. I.e. the truth to, say, the 99th decimal, is ' true enough ' for our purposes, and the 100th is a matter of indifference. But let that indifference cease, and the question become important, and the ' truth ' will at once become ' useful '. Prof. Taylor's illustration therefore conclusively proves that in an actual context and as an actual question there is no true answer to be got until the truth has become useful. This point is illustrated also by the context Prof. Taylor has himself suggested. For he has made the question about the 100th decimal important by making the refutation of the whole pragmatist theory of knowledge depend on it. And what nobler use could the 100th decimal have in his eyes? If in consequence of this interest he will set himself to work it out, he will discover this once useless, but now most useful, truth, and—triumphantly refute his own contention! ...|$|E
