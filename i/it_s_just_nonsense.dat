40|$|It {{might look}} like a {{defensive}} structure against marauding enemies, but in fact <b>it</b> <b>s</b> <b>just</b> a way to improve yields in your fish-pond. Just place rows of bamboo sticks in the pond about half a metre apart. The sticks serve as {{a breeding ground for}} periphyton (algae, bacteria, plankton and other organisms), on which fish thrive well. This cuts down on fish feed, always a considerable expense for fish farmers. In a joint project in south Asia, researchers from the universities of Mangalore (India), Mymensingh (Bangladesh), Stirling (Scotland), and Wageningen (The Netherlands) spent three years studying, improving and standardising the technique. They had encountered it being used by fishermen in open water, such as the lagoons of CÃ´te d Ivoire and Benin, and some Asian rivers. The effect of the sticks varies according to the type of fish. In the trials Indian carp and tilapia performed well, with yields increasing by 70 to 80 %. Other materials can be used as substrates, instead of bamboo. The researchers experimented with sugarcane bagasse, PVC pipes and jute sticks. All led to increased yields but none as much as bamboo. The bamboo can be re-used three to four times. Using rotting material should be avoided as it adversely affects fish production. An extra advantage of the stick-method is that they discourage poachers, since the sticks make it difficult to catch a lot of fish in a short time. The same goes for the fish farmer, who will not easily be able to catch small amounts of fish, but can best remove the sticks at one time and harvest all the fish in one go.

That was the message that re-emerged strongly at the 1999 Zimbabwe International Book Fair held in Harare last August. Under the theme of Women s voices: gender, books and development, an intensive programme of workshops, seminars and encounters focussed on the gender aspects of publishing in Africa. Key parts of the programme were organised by the African Publishing Network (APNET) with whom CTA, given its interest in developing technical publishing capacity in Africa, has worked {{since its inception in}} 1992. [APNET, incidentally, signed an unprecedented five-year partnership agreement with five Northern donor partners in New York on 9 November 1999]. CTA s strong presence at the ZIBF was much appreciated by the many visitors working in agriculture and rural development, and gave the CTA delegation a rare opportunity of on-site exposure to gender-focussed exchanges and organisations. This will be especially useful in reinforcing the considerable efforts now underway to improve the distribution and readership of Spore, and the CTA publications output in general, among women and women s organisations.

Take {{a look at}} the diaries of the world s political leaders chock-a-block with summit meetings, sometimes two in one week. In mid-June 2002, squashed between an environmental summit in Brazil and a richest nation moot, with NEPAD partners, in Canada, was the World Food Summit Five Years Later in Rome, Italy. There, under the absent eye of most northern Heads of State, and with massive (but very porous) security, the leaders of many developing countries, powerless and budget-challenged, reaffirmed the previous summit s pledge in 1996 to halve the number of hungry people in the world within the, by now, next 12 years. Tying up the time of 6, 613 participants, 74 Heads of State or Government, 181 country representatives, 1, 200 civil society people and 1, 601 media representatives (the equivalent of 250 working years), have such summits become exercises in pompous insincerity, or do they have a value? In terms of promises kept, no. The networking, though, driven by the hundreds of southern NGOs that made the journey, was a joy to behold. The rapprochements between NGOs and the World Bank, the furtive search of the life science industrialists and farmers leaders for partnership, the opportunity to coax the EU representative almost to seek forgiveness for subsidised agriculture all these mark a new phase in cooperation which could change the face of ACP agriculture. That makes a summit worthwhile. And it brings out the occasional chance remark that could trigger off quite a debate, such as that by Nobel prize winner Amartya Sen on poverty and hunger: 'What really matters is that people can buy food; where it is produced is not important.

40|$|This book {{could have}} been called 'How to win friends and {{influence}} people' but that title was taken way back in 1936 for what became a classic {{in the art of}} persuasion. That art, for institutions seeking funds, favours or friends, is now called public awareness building. This manual is a solid and comprehensive introduction to the task facing more and more agricultural organisations, namely that of explaining their goals, their needs and their services to the various publics they seek to serve, or rely upon. As such, it fits into the long-term CTA programme of assisting partners to heighten their public profile. It looks in detail at separate and linked approaches and tools: press releases, dealing with the press, interview techniques, newsletters, annual reports, audio-visual presentations, publicity events, fairs, crisis situations, monitoring and evaluation, and more. But, beware, using all the tools in this book will not necessarily win you all the attention you want. In communication there are two sides to any story, and what you say may not be what your targets hear. They also notice what emanates from your institution. That aspect is often overlookedby institutions who believe that public awareness is just a set of mechanistic tools. No, <b>it</b> <b>s</b> more than that. Go outside your organisation and try to understand how others see you, how they interpret your body language, your behaviour. Does your institution look confident or brash? Cooperative or sneery? Blustering or reliable? <b>It</b> <b>s</b> not <b>just</b> a question of getting your way; you have to get understood properly too. This book, the simpler side of the coin, can help you get there.
