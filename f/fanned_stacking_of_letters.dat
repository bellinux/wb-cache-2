5000|$|Upwords (also branded as Scrabble Upwords in the United States and Canada, and Topwords Crucimaster, Betutorony, Palabras Arriba, Stapelwoord {{in other}} countries) is a board game invented by Elliot Rudell and {{originally}} {{published by the}} Milton Bradley Company, now a division of Hasbro. The game remains under license to Hasbro by Rudell Design, LLC. Upwords is similar to Scrabble, or Words With Friends, in that players build words using letter tiles on a gridded gameboard. The point of difference is that in Upwords letters can be <b>stacked</b> on top <b>of</b> other <b>letters</b> already on the gameboard to create new words. The higher the <b>stack</b> <b>of</b> <b>letters,</b> the more points are scored. This typically makes words built in later turns of the game more valuable than earlier words, increasing play intensity and adding a level of strategy unique to Upwords. The memorization of two-letter words is considered a useful skill in this game.|$|R
25|$|The {{contestant}} {{in control}} chooses between two <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>letter</b> tiles, one containing vowels {{and the other}} consonants, and Riley reveals the top tile from that stack and places it on the board. This is done nine times, and the final grouping must contain at least three vowels and four consonants. The contestants then have 30 seconds to form the longest single word they can, using the nine revealed letters; no letter may be used more often than it appears in the selection. The frequencies <b>of</b> the <b>letters</b> within each stack are weighted according to their frequency in natural English, {{in the same manner}} as Scrabble. For example, there are many Ns and Rs in the consonant stack, but only one Q. The letter frequencies are altered by the producers from time to time, so any published list does not necessarily reflect the letters used in any particular programme.|$|R

Each RNALogo graph is composed <b>of</b> <b>stacks</b> <b>of</b> <b>letters,</b> with one <b>stack</b> for each position in the consensus RNA secondary structure. RNALogo provides a convenient and high configurable logo generator. An RNALogo graph is generated for each RNA family in Rfam, and these generated logos are accumulated into a gallery of RNALogo.

50|$|Initially Langdon’s ambigrams {{followed}} the yin/yang model, featuring rotational symmetry. But when the name STARSHIP resisted his efforts, he resorted to mirror image symmetry, establishing a second format. The STARSHIP, ambigram {{was sold to}} Jefferson Starship and appeared on the label of the Spitfire album (1976). Other approaches to ambigram designs followed: chain ambigrams are those that will not work as self-contained words, but when separate parts of a word can each be created symmetrically, they can be linked, end to end in an infinite chain. These can be of either rotational or mirror-image type. Mirror image chains are rare; rotational chains are normally presented in a circular format. Totem ambigrams, so named due to their vertical <b>stacking</b> <b>of</b> <b>letters,</b> present mirror-image symmetry. Totem ambigrams give the artist greater flexibility as to what letter may {{be called upon to}} mirror another. A non-symmetrical type of ambigram is the Figure/Ground illusion, 8 in which spaces within and between the <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> one word form the <b>letters</b> <b>of</b> a second word. These are verbal versions of the well-known profiles-and-chalice illusion. For these, a voluntary perception shift is required of the viewer.|$|R
