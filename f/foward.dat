At its meeting on August 9, 2005, the Technical Panel unanimously recommended MR‐ 00289 ‐ R 00 ‐R 06 : Outage Coordination – 14 ‐Day Advance Approval and Generator Testing to the IESO Board for its approval with a recommended effective date of December 7, 2005. This rule amendment came directly from the deliberations of the OPSC. Also at the same meeting the Technical Panel endorsed the re‐drafting of the outage coordination provisions of the market rules in plain language if and when any further amendments to this section of the market rules are proposed by the OPSC. To meet this direction, the OPSC has developed a work plan and is <b>fowarding</b> it to the Technical Panel to keep them apprised of the schedule for development because the changes are expected to unfold over the coming months.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{economic}} globalisation and urbanisation is currently {{taking place in}} and around Southeast Asian metropolitan regions. In Malaysia, the Klang-Langat Valley is an extended metropolitan region (EMR). The region is expanding very rapidly. The process of urban sprawl in the EMR tends to favour the southern corridor. This paper discusses the growth of manufacturing and service activities and their impacts on settlements located in the peripheral areas of the EMR. Analysis of data gathered from the Population and Housing Census of Malaysia and various economic reports indicates that the proces of economic development and urbanisation in the Klang-Langat Valley EMR is mainly concentrated in the core and internal areas of the region. However {{there is a clear}} indication that such development is shifting towards the peripheries. Various advanced producer services such as research and development, computeration, banking, insurance, fast <b>fowarding</b> and delivery services which are vital for manufacturing processes have emerged to strengthen the functions of metropolitan city of Kuala Lumpur. Availabality of these services are facilitated by the most up-to date technology which could benefit firms located in the region in terms of urbanisation economy. Many more corporate headquaters are established in the core and internal zones {{while at the same time}} the manufacturing and public services relocate their activities to the peripheries of the EMR. The shift of economic activities to the peripheries has brought about change and urbanisation of the area, resulting in the growth of many housing schemes and planned small towns in the peripheries. However, characteristics of these settlements are clearly distinct from those settlements known to many writers as desakota which used to be found in many metropolitan cities of Southeast Asia. Although Kuala Lumpur has not been regarded as a mega city, in the near future, with the fast expansion of her built-up areas, the city will emerge as one of most prominent conurbations in this region...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi comparar a resistência tênsil e a evolução da reação tecidual da parede {{abdominal}} de ratos, submetidos à incisão mediana e fechamento abdominal em três técnicas diferentes: fechamento por planos, fechamento por planos complementada com pontos subtotais e fechamento por planos complementada com tela de poliglactina 910, estudados no primeiro, no sétimo e no décimo quarto dia de pós-operatório. O teste de resistência, utilizado para aferir a resistência à ruptura, foi descrito por UDUPA & CHANSOURIA 17, em 1969. Após a realização do teste, procedeu-se à ressecção de parte da ferida cirúrgica, sendo encaminhado o material para estudo microscópico ao Departamento de Patologia da USF. Os resultados obtidos no teste de resistência tênsil mostraram que as técnicas de fechamento abdominal complementadas com reforço conferem maior resistência à tração da parede abdominal nos primeiros dias do pós-operatório. A comparação dos testes de resistência, efetuados no décimo quarto dia, revelou que a resistência à tração da parede abdominal encontrava-se semelhante nos diferentes métodos utilizados. O estudo da reação tecidual, observada neste trabalho, mostrou um aumento da reação nos subgrupos de ratos em que se aplicaram as técnicas de reforço, sendo mais intensa quando do uso da tela de poliglactina 910. Conclui-se portanto que os métodos de fechamento de parede abdominal em ratos, quando da utilização de reforço, conferem à parede abdominal, nos primeiros dias de pós-operatório, maior resistência à tração. Em relação à reação tecidual, ela é maior quando se usa técnicas de reforço. The {{purpose of}} this work was to compare the tensile resistance {{and the evolution of}} the tissue reaction of the rats&# 146; abdominal wall, submitted to the mediana incision and abdominal wound closing by three different techniques: closing by plans, closing by plans completed with subtotal points and closing by plans completed with a poliglactina 910 mesh, studied in the first, the seventh and fourteenth post-operative days. 90 Wistar rats were studied, divided into three groups of 30 in each one in which the techniques described were conducted and afterwards subdivided into nine subgroups of 10 rats each, in which the test of tensile resistance was realized. The resistance test used for checking the resistance, the rupture was described by UDUPA & CHANSOURIA, in 1969. Afer the realization of the test a resection was made {{in a part of the}} surgical wound and <b>fowarded</b> for a microscopical study. The results obtained in the tensile resistance test showed the techniques of the abdominal wound closing, complemented with reinforcement give greater resistance to the traction of the abdominal wall in the first post-operativedays. The comparison of the tissue reaction observed in this work showed an increase of the reaction in the subgroups of rats in which the techniques of reinforcement were used, being more intense when using the poliglactina 910 mesh. I t was concluded therefore, that the methods of closing the abdominal wound wall in rats, when using the reinforcement, gave a greater resistance to the traction in the abdominal wall in the first post-operative days. In relation to the tissue reaction, this is greater when using the reinforcement techniques...|$|R
