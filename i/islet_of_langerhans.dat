25|$|Hormones are {{the major}} {{signaling}} molecules of the endocrine system, though they often regulate each other's secretion via local signaling (e.g. <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> cells), and most are also expressed in tissues for local purposes (e.g. angiotensin) or failing that, structurally related molecules are (e.g. PTHrP).|$|E
25|$|When the {{glucose level}} {{comes down to}} the usual {{physiologic}} value, insulin release from the β-cells slows or stops. If the blood glucose level drops lower than this, especially to dangerously low levels, release of hyperglycemic hormones (most prominently glucagon from <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> alpha cells) forces release of glucose into the blood from the liver glycogen stores, supplemented by gluconeogenesis if the glycogen stores become depleted. By increasing blood glucose, the hyperglycemic hormones prevent or correct life-threatening hypoglycemia.|$|E
25|$|Sulfatide {{has several}} isoforms, {{including}} C16:0, which is found {{primarily in the}} secretory granules and toward {{the surface of the}} membrane of β cells. Secretory granules and β cells are found in the <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> and in rat β TC3 cells. Research has shown that in the pancreases of type II diabetic mouse models, there is a deficiency of C16:0. Additional research has shown that C16:0 {{plays an important role in}} assisting to improve insulin crystal preservation, and as the β cells in the pancreas secrete insulin, sulfatide aids in the monomerization of insulin, which is the breakdown of insulin into its basics components or monomers. Consequently, sulfatide is needed in order to maintain normal insulin secretion, which sulfatide is capable of mediating through stimulation of calcium dependent exocytosis and Adenosine triphosphate(ATP) sensitive potassium ion channels. Sulfatide can also stimulate proinsulin folding as well, as it can serve as a molecular chaperone for insulin.|$|E
50|$|In mammals, insulin is {{synthesized}} in {{the pancreas}} within the β-cells <b>of</b> the <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans.</b> One million to three million <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> (pancreatic <b>islets)</b> form the endocrine {{part of the}} pancreas, which is primarily an exocrine gland.

50|$|Insulin is {{produced}} by the pancreas in a region called <b>Islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans.</b> In the <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans,</b> there are beta-cells, which are responsible for production of insulin.

40|$|In diabetes, {{pancreatic}} ß-cells {{play a key}} role. These {{cells are}} clustered within structures called <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> inside the pancreas and produce insulin, which is directly secreted into the blood stream.

40|$|Abstract. <b>Islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> are microorgans {{scattered}} throughout the pancreas, and are responsible for synthesizing and secreting pancreatic hormones. While progress has recently been made concerning cell differentiation <b>of</b> the <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans,</b> the mechanism controlling islet morphogenesis is not known. It is thought that these islets are formed by mature cell association, first differentiating in the primitive pancreatic epithelium, then migrating in the extracellular matrix, and finally associating into <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans.</b> This mechanism suggests that the extracellular matrix has to be degraded for proper islet morphogenesis.

40|$|Body weight {{regulation}} {{is the result}} of food intake and energy expenditure. The central nervous system (CNS), and in particular, the hypothalamus, controls food intake as well as metabolism, the latter mainly by autonomic effects on the <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans,</b> hepatocytes and adipocytes. Body weight, more precisely body fat content, is probably controlled by a feedback mechanism in which insulin, released from the B cell of the <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans,</b> plays a key role. The <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> is an intricate neuroendocrine unit in which the release of glucagon, insulin, and somatostatin from A, B, and D cells, respectively, is controlled by the CNS via a rich autonomic innervation. In addition, the endocrine cells of the pancreas influence each other by paracrine actions. The CNS control of the islets shapes the plasma insulin and blood glucose profiles during the circadian cycle and thereby regulates the nutrient flow to the different tissues in the body. Thus, the CNS structures involved in regulation of body weight and food intake control also metabolism. The mechanisms contributing to match food intake and the needs of metabolism are discussed. ...|$|E

50|$|The {{discovery}} of a role for the pancreas in diabetes is generally ascribed to Joseph von Mering and Oskar Minkowski, who in 1889 found that dogs whose pancreas was removed developed all the {{signs and symptoms of}} diabetes and died shortly afterwards. In 1910, Sir Edward Albert Sharpey-Schafer suggested that people with diabetes were deficient in a single chemical that was normally produced by the pancreas—he proposed calling this substance''''insulin'''', from the Latin insula, meaning island, in reference to the insulin-producing <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> in the pancreas. The endocrine role of the pancreas in metabolism, and indeed the existence of insulin, was further clarified in 1921, when Sir Frederick Grant Banting and Charles Herbert Best repeated the work of Von Mering and Minkowski, and went further to demonstrate they could reverse induced diabetes in dogs by giving them an extract from the pancreatic <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> <b>of</b> healthy dogs. The <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> was discovered in 1869 by an anatomist named Paul Langerhans. He identified the keys cells in the pancreas which produce the main substance that controls glucose levels in the body.|$|R

Materials and Methods. Using antibodies to S 100 protein, to main hormones produced in the <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> in human pancreas (insulin, glucagon and somatostatin), and to neuron-specific enolase (NSE) we carried out an immunohistochemical analysis of human pancreatic samples. The samples were taken from adults without pancreatic diseases, from patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, as well as from fetuses and newborns. Results. Two types of S 100 -positive cells can be found in human <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> starting from gestation week 15 – 16 : cells located on islet periphery, and cells situated inside an islet. Cells located on periphery are flattened and have small amount of cytoplasm. These cells have long processes extending mainly along periphery. The cells located inside islets are oval- or round-shaped, and generally have no processes. Conclusion. In an early fetal period in <b>islets</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> <b>of</b> human pancreas, two types of S 100 -positive cells appear, they being different in their structure. The cells on periphery are similar morphologically to glial cells. The cells inside islets are no different in their structure from other endocrine cells.

This study {{is an attempt to}} investigate the effects of radiofrequency (RF) radiation produced by GSM mobile phones on the insulin release in rats. Methods: Forty two female adult Sprague Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups. Group 1 were exposed to RF radiation 6 hours per day for 7 days. Group 2 received sham exposure (6 hours per day for 7 days). Groups 3 and 4 received RF radiation 3 hours per day for 7 days and sham exposure (3 hours per day), respectively. The specific absorption rate (SAR) of RF was 2. 0 W/kg. Results: Our results showed that RF radiations emitted from mobile phone could not alter insulin release in rats. However, mild to severe inflammatory changes in the portal spaces of the liver of rats as well as damage in the cells of <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> were observed. These changes were linked with the duration of the exposures.

Histological analysis demonstrated that the exocrine pancreatic tissues were dispersed within the hepatic parenchyma and spleen in L. rohita. Thin septa of connective tissue separated parenchyma of liver and also the spleen from exocrine pancreatic cells. However, in M. vittatus, the discrete pancreatic tissue formed distinct oval or elongated acini interspersed with small area of <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans</b> and blood vessels. In N. notopterus, the rhomboidal acinar cells of discrete pancreatic tissue intercalated with comparatively clear and large <b>islet</b> <b>of</b> <b>Langerhans.</b> The exocrine acinar cells in all the three species were provided with prominent nuclei and densely packed zymogen granules.
