40|$|Abstract Title: the Danish Representative Democracy: <b>genuine</b> {{political}} <b>equality</b> and legitimacy? Written by: Sofie Krøll Westphal Pedersen & Silje Biørnstad Denmark {{is known}} for being a democratic and equal country. Still the Hoover index has grown from 23, 8 % in 1990 to 26, 8 % in 2005. This {{is not the only}} measure witnessing a growth in inequality in Denmark. Numbers from Eurostat shows that the inequality in Denmark from 2005 until 2012 has grown the most out of all the European countries. In the same time frame we have experienced a number of political reforms on the labour marked. Due to this we started wondering if all citizens have the same opportunity to influence the adopted policies. We found theory stating that the citizens must have somehow the same economical resources in order for a democracy to be well functioning. Based on that theory and our general wondering we formulated the following research question: Is <b>genuine</b> political <b>equality</b> found in the Danish representative democracy? And how does the level of <b>genuine</b> political <b>equality</b> influence the legitimacy in the political system? Working questions Furthermore we developed three working questions, which were beneficial and helpful in the search for an answer to our research question. We have answered the three different working questions in three different chapters. Chapter 1 contains an explanation on the formal equality in the Danish democracy and an explanation on how the involvement in the Danish representative democracy has developed. Here we are concentrating on the requirements for formal political equality and the movement from a class solidarity to a political involvement based on individual values. Chapter 2 contains an analysis on whether there is in fact <b>genuine</b> political <b>equality</b> in the representative democracy or not. We are here focusing on the requirements for formal political equality found in chapter 1. Furthermore we are analysing whether these requirements also mean that there is in fact <b>genuine</b> political <b>equality.</b> Chapter 3 is our last chapter written in order to answer our research question, and contains an assessment on how the level of <b>genuine</b> political <b>equality</b> in the Danish representative democracy affects the legitimacy. Methods and theories In our project we chose five concepts to serve as our theory. In each of the concepts several authors are mentioned. The concepts are as following: the ideal representative democracy, the post-democracy, the liberal democracy, inequality and legitimacy. Our project is based on critical theory and we have used a qualitative research strategy in order to answer our research question. Conclusion In our project we conclude that there is formal political equality in the Danish representative democracy in almost all the essential aspects stated by Dahl and Knudsen. But certain factors such as the paradox of the dominating liberal-democracy, the unequal access to the public debate and the lack of diversity among the elected politicians, limit the amount of <b>genuine</b> political <b>equality</b> in Danish political system. According to the ‘vicious circle of inequality’ the lack of <b>genuine</b> political <b>equality</b> will mainly limit the political influence of the citizens, who already have a lack of economic resources. This will make these citizens even more insecure and when citizens are insecure it will often result in mistrust in the elected politicians. The politicians need to have the trust of the citizens in order to maintain their legitimacy and thus a lack of <b>genuine</b> political <b>equality</b> is dangerous for the legitimacy of the political system...|$|R

40|$|This paper criticizes Brudner's purported dialectical {{deduction}} {{and hence}} "justification" of a communitarian form of liberalism. Brudner's argument begins from an atomistic and libertarian conception of liberalism as {{the idea of}} individuals having independent worth as self-sufficient agents. It attempts {{to show that the}} contradictions in such a view require resolution, first, through a move to the notion of the equal worth of individuals as autonomous beings and, finally, through the contradictions within egalitarianism to the subsumption of liberty and equality in a liberal community. The point of the deduction is to show that the only conceptually stable and hence viable form of liberalism is communitarian. The paper argues that Brudner's starting-point in independent worth does not express a <b>genuine</b> independence. <b>Equality</b> and community are present implicitly within his initial formulation. Hence, there are no contradictions and no demonstration through their resolution that liberalism, however initially conceived, must end up as communitarian in form. This {{is not to say that}} a genuine initial independent individualism cannot be clearly formulated. However, such a position would not generate any supposed contradictions and could lead to a "justification" of a liberal community only on the basis of utilitarian and rational contractarian claims, more in the manner of Hobbes than Hegel...|$|R

From my study I show how it opened up opportunities for women from both middle class and working class backgrounds to be first-in-the-family to go to university. I will also argue that whilst there have been very welcome changes in education, and HE especially, such that there is a gender balance of undergraduate students in HE, {{this does not mean that}} gender equality has been achieved.

The latest statistics of 2010 revealed that positions filled by women account for only 19 % and 29 % in top management and senior management respectively (personal communication with Lucy Holbol, South African Institute of Race and Relations (SAIRR) via email, April 2012). Data was collected at an Information Technology department of a company in Pretoria, South Africa using face-to-face semi-structured interviews. Thematic analysis and a listening guide were used to analyse the data. The findings of the study are located within the theoretical framework of social constructionism of gendered identity as well as the role of language in constructing gender in the workplace. Moreover, the main themes that emerged in the analysis were: the gendered organisational culture; reasons why men are better suited than women for the field of Information Technology; caring for children and the ability to cope with work responsibilities simultaneously; the languaging around senior management positions; the gender of management; and perspectives of race and gender policies within the South African workplace.

50|$|The German judicare system {{leads to}} the review of legal aid cases on indigence and their merits first by the lawyers in private practice, then the courts, while averting {{dependence}} on external legal aid institutions removed from the judicial process. Another element of strength lies in the system’s low cost. Altogether smaller amounts of state budgets are provided for legal aid per capita compared with other European countries. To secure receiving their fees through legal aid, lawyers’ drafted briefs must have arguable merit thereby ensuring the high quality of representation of indigents. Substandard performance of lawyers is therefore not an option. The German model is also considered to put the indigent litigant on <b>genuine</b> <b>equality</b> with a wealthy litigant. The indigent has the same right to choose her lawyer as a more affluent person. The lawyer representing the indigent is naturally motivated to win the case since as a victorious party he is entitled to recover the full lawyer’s fees, i.e. not just the reduced legal aid fees, from the party that loses the case. The loser-pays-all system constitutes an incentive for lawyers to represent indigent clients.|$|E

[...] In the August 24, 1957, issue, Buckley's editorial [...] "Why the South Must Prevail" [...] spoke out explicitly in favor of temporary segregation in the South until [...] "long term equality could be achieved." [...] It argued that [...] "the central question that emerges... is whether the White community in the South is entitled to take such measures as are necessary to prevail, politically and culturally, in areas where it does not predominate numerically? The sobering answer is Yes—the White community is so entitled because, for the time being, it is the advanced race." [...] His answer was that temporary segregation in the South was a good idea now (in 1957) and the black population lacked the education, economic, or cultural development for racial equality to be possible, claiming the white South had [...] "the right to impose superior mores for whatever period it takes to effect a <b>genuine</b> cultural <b>equality</b> between the races." [...] Two weeks after that editorial was published, another prominent conservative writer, L.

30|$|Across {{the former}} socialist {{countries}} in Eastern Europe and Central Asia, wages were mostly assigned by central planners by establishing an occupational wage scale within each industry—and wages were then set as {{a multiple of}} the wage of the lowest-grade occupation, the base wage (Brainerd 2000). Another noteworthy feature of the wage setting scheme in most former socialist countries is the extreme compression of wage scales—so that top managers, for example, would rarely earn {{more than five times}} as much as the average manual worker, whereas the same ratio has been known to reach 20 -to- 1 or more in the USA (Brainerd 2000). It should be noted that while other labor market institutions included widespread membership in official unions, with the exception of Poland, these unions played little role in wage determination (Brainerd 2000). Together with government policies such as relatively high minimum wages and generous maternity leave and day care benefits in most of these countries (Brainerd 2000; Kuddo 2009), this would seem to have both encouraged women to work and also to have generated relatively low (if any) gender wage gaps in these former socialist countries back in the days of socialism. Indeed, “the socialist countries of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union were long committed—at least nominally—to gender equality in the labor market” (Brainerd 2000 : 138). For example, employer discrimination against pregnant and nursing women was prohibited, and mothers with small children had the right to work part-time—so that female labor force rates and female educational attainment in the former Soviet Union were {{among the highest in the}} world (Abdurazakova 2010). <b>Genuine</b> gender <b>equality,</b> however, was never achieved—for example, women tended to concentrate in the state subsidized sectors of the economy such as health care, medicine, education, textile, and food industries where average wages were below the overall national average, and women were substantially underrepresented in leadership and top managerial positions (Abdurazakova 2010).|$|R

40|$|There {{has been}} a lot of talk about post-racialism since the 2008 {{election}} of Barack Obama as the first black President of the United States. Some have argued that the Obama election illustrates the evolution of the United States from its unfortunate racist past to a more admirable post-racial present in which the problem of invidious racial discrimination has largely been overcome. Others have argued that the Obama election illustrates only that an extraordinarily gifted, mixed-race, multiple Ivy League graduate, Harvard Law Review President was able to overcome the persistent discriminatory racial practices that continue to disadvantage the bulk of less fortunate racial minority group members in the United States. Part I of this essay discusses the claim that we have now become a post-racial society, arguing that this claim itself constitutes a form of systemic discrimination against racial minorities. Section I. A describes the history of Supreme Court involvement in the sacrifice of minority interests for the benefit of the white majority in order to establish a context in which the racial jurisprudence of the contemporary Supreme Court can be assessed. Section I. B describes how the contemporary Court has used post-racial assumptions to perpetuate discrimination against racial minorities in the name of protecting the equality interests of whites. Part II discusses the Supreme Court’s hostility to disparate impact claims. Section II. A describes how the Court rejected disparate impact claims under its constitutional equality jurisprudence. Section II. B describes how the Roberts Court is extending this hostility to the statutory disparate impact claims created by Congress in Title VII. Part III argues that the recognition of disparate impact claims is a sensible precommitment strategy for the resolution of the nation’s persistent racial discrimination problem. Section III. A argues that racial discrimination is so deeply embedded in United States culture that it cannot be eradicated through mere voluntary efforts to behave in nondiscriminatory ways. Section III. B argues that viewing racially disparate impact as sufficiently suspect to warrant a presumptive remedy would enable the culture to approximate the <b>genuine</b> racial <b>equality</b> that its ingrained racial attitudes have thus far precluded it from attaining. The Conclusion expresses the fear that Supreme Court jurisprudence will continue to reject disparate impact claims in the name of post-racialism precisely because the Court is one of the institutions on which the culture relies to perpetuate its systemic discrimination against racial minorities...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} a {{critical}} review of educated women’s leadership in their emancipation in Ethiopia. Did they provide leadership and to what extent? It is to be noted that educated women’s leadership has been of great importance to women’s emancipation worldwide. Strong leadership was also {{the driving force behind}} women’s movements and feminism everywhere. However, the role of educated women in Ethiopia is hard to discern and their leadership efforts are largely invisible. On the other hand, many among the educated also lack the passion and desire to commit themselves in the fight for women’s emancipation. In this thesis I researched the settings and frameworks of women’s leadership and discussed the factors that function as limitations and/or opportunities. Overall there were more limitations than opportunities. These limitations are often historically rooted in the country’s religious, cultural, economic, political and traditional systems. And, as much as history and religion can be a source of strength and pride for many, they can also be a serious obstacle. The political regime of the Derg also scarred an entire population to the extent that despite the currently proclaimed ‘freedom’ of the EPRDF ruling party, women remain reluctant to step forward and claim their rights. The ruling party appears to appropriate women’s emancipation as a “private” interest and to use it for political gain, {{in the same manner as}} the Derg regime had done before it. Nowhere is there any sign of <b>genuine</b> freedom and <b>equality</b> for women in practice. Rhetoric reigns supreme through laws and policy documents, but they are not matched by genuine actions and concrete strategies. The traditional religious base of society is also making it more difficult to challenge autocratic tendencies of the ruling elite. The effect is that civil society is slowly being pushed to extinction, leaving the ruling party in charge as the main actor in all public services. This has serious consequences for the genuine emancipation of women in the country. The thesis finds that women’s leadership is not a luxury or personal demand, but a crucial step for the development of the country at large. It is encouraging to note that there are different sections of active women in the country waiting for strong leadership, leadership that can unite them into a movement and guide them on their unique emancipation paths. After all, it is only women themselves who, with their existing epistemic advantage, can transform their situation and change their status. Sociology(D. Litt. et Phil. (Sociology) ...|$|R

Certain readings of Black Consciousness reflect the philosophy as espousing a more regressive as opposed to a progressive liberatory politics. Furthermore, Black Consciousness with {{its focus on}} race its critics will argue is not in line with a politics of non-racialism which seeks a total rejection of race. However, such an understanding of non-racialism is a very limited and unsophisticated one as it entails a rejection of race without first engaging with the concrete reality of race, while also assuming that a rejection of race entails integration. Indeed, it may be a great goal to attain a society in which race does not matter and in which it is not a determining factor in the life of any individual. Yet, to not see race when race has had and continues to have a profound impact on South African society, especially the poor black majority, may serve to be more regressive than progressive. In a society where inequality manifests along racial lines a hastily sought integration may not serve to attain the desired outcome of a <b>genuine</b> non-racial society. <b>Equality</b> thus becomes a central perquisite to make possible the attainment of a non-racial society unhindered by the limitations of white superiority and black inferiority. With the persistence of inequality accompanied by white domination and acquiescing blacks a non-racial society will serve to be an illusion. Biko, through his articulation of the Black Consciousness philosophy sought the attainment of a radical egalitarianism; this from the Black Consciousness optic being the condition upon which a non-racial politics and society could be forged. Black Consciousness has the ability to create a truly non-racial subject, its sophisticated conception of race which conceives of race as being consciously contrived can serve to illustrate the implicit non-racial outlook of the Black Consciousness philosophy. Through the project of Black Consciousness the end goal could indeed be perceived as being a radical egalitarian non-racial society. The overall tenor is that Black Consciousness complements non-racialism more than it contradicts it...|$|R
