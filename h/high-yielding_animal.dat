40|$|Ethiopia holds large {{potential}} for dairy development {{due to its}} large livestock population, the favorable climate for improved, <b>high-yielding</b> <b>animal</b> breeds, and the relatively disease-free environment for livestock. Given the considerable {{potential for}} smallholder income and employment generation from high-value dairy products, development of the dairy sector in Ethiopia can contribute significantly to poverty alleviation and nutrition in the country. Like other sectors of the economy, the dairy sector in Ethiopia has passed through three phases or turning points, following {{the economic and political}} policy in the country. In the most recent phase, characterized by the transition towards market-oriented economy, the dairy sector appears to be moving towards a takeoff stage. Liberalized markets and private sector investment and promotion of smallholder dairy are the main features of this phase. Milk production during the 1990 s expanded {{at an annual rate of}} 3. 0 percent compared to 1. 63 - 1. 66 percent during the preceding three decades. Review of the development of dairy sector in Ethiopia indicates that there is a need to focus interventions more coherently. Development interventions should be aimed at addressing both technological gaps and marketing problems. Integration of crossbred cattle to the sector is imperative for dairy development in the country. This can be achieved either through promotion of large private investment to introduce new technology in the sector such as improved genotypes, feed and processing, and promotion of integration of crossbred cattle into the smallholder sector through improving their access to improved cattle breeds, AI service, veterinary service, and credit. Similarly, government should also take the lead in building infrastructure and providing technical service to smallholders. Severe shortages, low quality and seasonal unavailability of feed likewise remain as major constraints to livestock production in Ethiopia. These constraints need to be addressed and technological change be promoted to increase milk production. Discussion paperNon-PRIFPRI 1 EPT...|$|E

30|$|Growth hormone (GH) plays a {{vital role}} in {{different}} biological processes, such as growth, metabolism, lactation, and reproduction of farm animal species (Malveiro et al. 2001; Ola et al. 2008; Boutinaud et al. 2003; Seevagan et al. 2015; Katoh et al. 2008; Reinecke et al. 1993). GH is released from the anterior lobe of pituitary gland, where its main effects are associated with the stimulation of growth of bones and skeletal muscles, through the action of insulin-like growth factor (IGF- 1) (An et al. 2011), as well as its great role in milk production (Akers 2006). Consequently, it has been observed that <b>high-yielding</b> <b>animals</b> reveal greater GH levels in comparison to low-yielding ones (Akers 2006). The Caprine GH gene has been mapped on the short arm of goat chromosome 19 (Capra hircus 19 q 22) (Supakorn 2009). It is encoded by 2.5 Â kbp. Caprine GH gene consists of five exons and four intervening introns (Accession: D 00476) (Missohou et al. 2006). The aim {{of the present study was}} to screen the genetic polymorphism of goat GH gene in three common goat breeds in Egypt (Barki, Damascus, and Zaraibi) employing two genetic tools; PCR-RFLP and DNA sequencing.|$|R
40|$|This paper aims {{to compare}} {{different}} adaptive {{responses of the}} mammary gland of cows, ewes, and goats submitted to extended milking intervals in different systems of management. Depending on the species, these extended milking intervals can be characterized by the following milk removal approaches; 3 milkings every 2 d, elimination of 1 milking per week (i. e., 13 vs. 14 milkings per week), and once-daily milking with additional suckling (i. e., dual purpose system of suckling and milking) or without suckling (exclusive once-daily milking). All the <b>high-yielding</b> <b>animals</b> and breeds adapted without problems to being submitted to intervals between milking less than 20 to 21 h. Under these conditions, all ruminant species demonstrated only low and transitory variations in milk production and quality. Thus, management systems using such an interval are good tools for the dairy producer who wants to save time without important adverse economic impact. When animals have good mammary gland health, these management systems can be applied without preliminary adaptation. However, goats and some breeds of dairy ewes seem to adapt to once-daily milking better than cows. Additionally, goats and ewes with higher production levels demonstrate a lower reduction in milk yield. With goats, {{there is only a}} limited variation in milk quality and cheese-making capacity of the milk produced, but ewes and cows show a significant enrichment of milk constituents, especially in fat. This indicates some differences in the regulation of lactose, protein, and fat synthesis depending on the duration of the milking interval and provides interesting models for physiological studies on milk secretion and synthesis regulation. Anatomical and physiological characteristics of lactating cows and ewes, in terms of cisternal vs. alveolar volumes within the mammary glands, could contribute to different abilities in adaptation to different milking systems. In goats, however, other mechanisms, such as compliancy of the mammary gland and regulation of tight junction impermeability, could be involved in milk secretion regulation and, thus, could become new targets for genetic selection of animals better adapted to accept extended milking intervals...|$|R
40|$|Journal articleGenetic {{analysis}} of the kappa-casein gene (CSN 3) promoter regions of 42 cattle representing 9 different breeds revealed that 2 distinct haplotypes (A and B) exist at this locus, differing from each other by single base changes at positions - 514 (T/G), - 426 (T/C), and - 384 (T/C), where haplotype A has bases T, T, and T and haplotype B has bases G, C, and C. The AA and AB haplotypes were found to occur at a higher frequency in the animals tested, with 69. 0 and 21. 4 % being homozygous and heterozygous, respectively. The sequences that include these polymorphisms are potentially important in transcriptional regulation of the kappa-casein gene, because they contain putative sites for binding of many transcription factors. Linkage disequilibrium between the kappa-casein promoter haplotype and either one of the 2 major kappa-casein coding sequence haplotypes was not evident. The A allele is dominant in all groups (dairy, beef, and dual purpose) with an allele frequency of 80 % and is higher among <b>high-yielding</b> dairy <b>animals</b> (88. 9 %) than among beef animals (75 %). The AB haplotype is comparatively rare in the dairy cattle (11. 1 %) compared with both beef and dual-purpose animals. The BB haplotype, though rare overall (9. 5 %), is much higher in dual-purpose animals (18. 8 %) than dairy (5. 6 %) animals. In contrast, the B allele is much more representative of the kappa-casein promoters from other ruminants. Enterprise Ireland; Teagasc Walsh fellowshi...|$|R
40|$|Ninety-five {{per cent}} of cows resume ovarian {{activity}} by day 50 postpartum. Numerous factors {{can influence the}} time taken, including nutritional status, intercurrent dis-ease (eg, lameness) {{and the degree of}} postpartum weight loss. Trace element deficiencies are often blamed for poor conception rates; however, in most circumstances it is more fruitful to address other issues such as feeding (amount and availability), housing and animal handling (farm staffâcow interactions). The sequence of events traditionally seen is: A rise in plasma follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) five days postpartum; Plasma luteinising hormone (LH) gradually increases until about day 10; After this, LH secretion is pulsatile; The LH pulse frequency gradually rises, culminating in the first preovulatory LH surge; Progesterone concentrations subsequently rise, but this increase generally lasts less than 10 days; Normal oestrous cycles follow. However, in <b>high-yielding</b> dairy <b>animals,</b> the inci-dence of abnormal progesterone concentrations, defined as no significant rise or a prolonged period (> 20 days) of increased progesterone, may be as high as 47 per cent. Factors that have been recognised as increasing the risk of delayed cyclicity include: An extended dry period; Health problems in the first month of lactation; Negative energy balance; Dystocia. One of the practical problems is that cows with a severe energy deficit can produce enough oestrogens to elicit an LH surge and ovulation, but not enough to induce oestrous behaviour. A negative (or positive) energy balance will, however, lead to changes in body condi-tion score (BCS), and regular condition scoring of individuals will enable diets to be modified to obtain the optimum BCS at critical times in the production cycle (see top left table on page 537). It should be borne in mind that adverse changes in BCS in one lactation may affect production, health and fertility in subsequent lactations...|$|R

Unfortunately, {{a large number of}} farm breeds have been lost and many more are at risk of loss. To disappear, replaced by few <b>high-yielding</b> and specialized <b>animals,</b> are local breeds. They are adapted to the local environmental and disease stresses, they need low external inputs and are able to give many different products (i. e. milk-meat-wool) and services.

Mountains are rich in local breeds that are resistant to inclement conditions of the surrounding environment, plastic enough to contribute to the self-sufficient economy of mountain communities, and preserved in genetic purity because of the geographic isolation. The research compares the strategies adopted in mountain areas for the conservation of three different sheep breeds facing extinction. Throughout deep-interviews to various actors (breeders, representatives of breeders' associations, SME, public officials, policy makers and researchers), the analysis reveals that in all case-studies the program of conservation is linked to a wider process of local development.

40|$|Influenza A viruses are {{the cause}} of annual {{epidemics}} of human disease with occasional outbreaks of pandemic proportions. The zoonotic nature {{of the disease and}} the vast viral reservoirs in the aquatic birds of the world mean that influenza will not easily be eradicated and that vaccines will continue to be needed. Recent technological advances in reverse genetics methods and limitations of the conventional production of vaccines by using eggs have led to a push to develop cell-based strategies to produce influenza vaccine. Although cell-based systems are being developed, barriers remain that need to be overcome if the potential of these systems is to be fully realized. These barriers include, but are not limited to, potentially poor reproducibility of viral rescue with reverse genetics systems and poor growth kinetics and yields. In this study we present a modified A/Puerto Rico/ 8 / 34 (PR 8) influenza virus master strain that has improved viral rescue and growth properties in the African green monkey kidney cell line, Vero. The improved properties were mediated by the substitution of the PR 8 NS gene for that of a Vero-adapted reassortant virus. The Vero growth kinetics of viruses with H 1 N 1, H 3 N 2, H 6 N 1, and H 9 N 2 hemagglutinin and neuraminidase combinations rescued on the new master strain were significantly enhanced in comparison to those of viruses with the same combinations rescued on the standard PR 8 master strain. These improvements pave the way for the reproducible generation of <b>high-yielding</b> human and <b>animal</b> influenza vaccines by reverse genetics methods.

In recent years he has managed agricultural research and development projects in the Caribbean for several international and regional organizations. He is currently the Deputy Executive Director (Development) of the Caribbean Agricultural Research and Development Institute (CARDI). Livestock development contributes to national agricultural output, so saving foreign exchange on imports, and {{can be a powerful}} stimulus to change among small and subsistence farmers. Small-scale dairying {{has been shown to be}} a harbinger of new disciplines and management practices that can be applied with great benefit in other agricultural enterprises. Agriculture in the Caribbean, in common with most ACP countries, is based mainly on crops rather than livestock. In the recent past, export crops have been predominant in terms of national priority and farmer prestige. Except in a few countries, livestock have been relegated to marginal lands and they have been farmed mostly in traditional ways to produce meat, hides and a little milk. Only in rare instances have they received supplementary feeding and other improved management techniques, such as pest and disease control on a sustained basis. Nor has livestock performance been recorded so as to permit more selective breeding and more advantageous feeding. Yet, in the Caribbean certainly, and possibly in many countries in Africa and the Pacific, the potential for improving livestock output is substantial and, with the improvement of livestock, comes the potential for the improvement of under-developed agriculture in general. As a result of the Caribbean region's specialization in export crops such as sugar, bananas, cotton, cocoa, coconut and spices, food self-sufficiency has suffered and costs of imported foods have risen. Livestock products, and feeds for livestock, now account for 53 % of the total food import bill. These imports include meat, and the full range of dairy products: liquid milk, butter and cheese. Grains and soya beans are also imported at considerable cost to feed the relatively modest livestock sector that does exist. Only recently have we begun to realise that the Caribbean is quite capable of growing excellent pasture grasses and legumes and in addition has available a range of suitable animal feed from byproducts of our traditional export crops and their associated industries. Also, the Caribbean has long had its own breeds of cattle and sheep adapted to the region and with a proven track record as milk and meat producers: the Jamaica Hope and Jamaica Red cattle, the Barbados Blackbelly sheep and the Buffalypso, a beef strain of water buffalo developed in Trinidad. Resource-poor farmers wisely avoid overdependence on any single farm enterprise and so initially livestock are required for more than one purpose: and in the case of cattle, for meat and milk. But it is milk production which may have the most interesting potential. Dairying is a challenge in that it requires high standards of management to breed and feed animals in order to achieve regular and sustained production of a sufficient quantity and quality of milk. Dairying also demands development of a collection, processing and distribution infrastructure if it is to go beyond the level- of localized self-sufficiency. But if these twin challenges (on and off the farm) are met, the benefits permeate other sectors of agricultural production, processing and distribution. Experience in Western Europe and in North America showed that the development of milk production for urban centres provided the financial, technical and management catalyst to farming in general. The most immediate benefit of milk production is the regular income it provides virtually all-year-round. To produce milk of saleable quality, disciplines of regular milking and hygiene must be practiced. Records must be kept to itemize milk sold and to identify <b>high-yielding</b> <b>animals</b> that need supplementary feeding and whose female calves should be retained for breeding. To be productive, pastures need year-round management including timely grazing, cutting for conservation and fertilizing. Since milk should be produced throughout the year, cows must be mated so that calving and lactations are spread. The farmer who is introduced to these disciplines will surely also apply them to his or her other farm enterprises. CARDI has identified three main problems that must be addressed if the Caribbean States are to achieve their potential in livestock production: the improvement of management of all classes of livestock, including control of parasites; the upgrading of livestock, particularly sheep and goats, by crossing with improved breeds; and the development of our pasture grasses, legumes and forage tree species to substitute for imported feedstuffs. A new generation of young people is entering agriculture in the Caribbean. They are open to new ideas and will respond to farming systems that offer the stimulus of more technical inputs in place of the drudgery of past agricultural practices. Where governments have provided the right incentives by managing imports and encouraging infrastructure, the signs are that our farmers are interested in developing livestock, particularly dairying, as part of their farm production and that, as a result, the entire farm output will benefit.
