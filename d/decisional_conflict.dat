5000|$|Several {{researchers}} {{in this field}} have designed scales for measuring to what extent shared decision-making {{takes place in the}} clinical encounter and its effects, from the perspective of patients or healthcare professionals or both, or from the perspective of outside observers. The purpose of these scales is to explore what happens in shared decision-making and how much it happens, with the goal of applying this knowledge to incite healthcare professionals to practise it. Based on these scales, simple tools are being designed to help physicians better understand their patients’ decision needs. One such tool that has been validated, SURE, is a quick questionnaire for finding out in busy clinics which patients are not comfortable about the treatment decision (<b>decisional</b> <b>conflict).</b> SURE is based on O’Connor’s <b>Decisional</b> <b>Conflict</b> Scale [...] which is commonly used to evaluate patient decision aids. The four yes-or-no questions are about being Sure, Understanding the information, the Risk-benefit ratio, and sources of advice and Encouragement.|$|E
40|$|Background: As {{an early}} {{step in the}} {{development}} of a decision aid for idiopathic trigger finger (TF) we were interested in the level of <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> experienced by patients and hand surgeons. This study tested the null hypothesis that there is no difference in <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> between patients with one or more idiopathic trigger fingers and hand surgeons. Secondary analyses address the differences between patients and surgeons regarding the influence of the DCS-subcategories on the level of <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict,</b> as well as the influence of patient and physician demographics, the level of self-efficacy, and satisfaction with care on <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict.</b>   Methods: One hundred and five hand surgeon-members of the Science of Variation Group (SOVG) and 84 patients with idiopathic TF completed the survey regarding the <b>Decisional</b> <b>Conflict</b> Scale. Patients also filled out the Pain Self-efficacy Questionnaire (PSEQ) and the Patient Doctor Relationship Questionnaire (PDRQ- 9). Results: On average, patients had <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> comparable to physicians, but by specific category patients felt less informed and supported than physicians. The only factors associated with greater <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> was the relationship between the patient and doctor. Conclusions: There is a low, but measurable level of <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> among patients and surgeons regarding idiopathic trigger finger.

Methods: We conducted a cross-sectional survey on {{a convenience sample of}} 321 consecutive psychiatric outpatients with emotional disorders. All patients completed self-report questionnaires assessing sociodemographic and clinical variables, patients’ preference of participation in decision making, perceived <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> about treatment, adherence to prescribed treatment, and satisfaction with the psychiatric care provided. Multiple correspondences analysis was used to investigate relationships of <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> with the variables of interest. Results: Approximately, two-thirds of psychiatric outpatients self-reported <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> regarding their treatment. Interestingly, the presence of <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> did not influence significantly patients’ preferences of participation or their adherence to prescribed treatment. Patients without <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> registered significantly higher satisfaction. Multiple correspondences analysis evidenced two clear profiles: patients without <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> received the treatment they preferred, mainly psychotherapy or combined treatment, had been under psychiatric treatment for longer than 5 years, and self-reported high satisfaction with health care received; on the other hand, patients with <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> did not receive the treatment they preferred, were treated with pharmacotherapy alone {{for a period of time}} between 1 and 5 years, and self-reported medium satisfaction with received health care.

University of Missouri [...] Kansas City, 2017 Background: Symptom relief in {{peripheral arterial disease}} (PAD) {{can be obtained by}} invasive options such as endovascular stenting as well as exercise, and PAD medications. Each of these options have their own risks and benefits. A lack of knowledge about treatment options, risks and benefits, and how these matter to the patient, as well as a lack of support relating to treatment decisions can result in <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict.</b> We aimed to (1) document <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> in patients facing PAD treatment decisions; (2) examine site variability in decisional conflict; and (3) examine whether <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> is associated with PAD treatment strategy and 1 -year health status outcomes. Methods: The PORTRAIT study is an observational prospective study that enrolled patients with new or an exacerbation of PAD symptoms from 16 PAD specialty clinics in the US, the Netherlands, and Australia. Patients were interviewed before they underwent PAD treatments to document their socio-economic background and their health status (Peripheral Artery Questionnaire – PAQ). Medical history was abstracted from the medical records. At 3 months, treatment information and <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> (yes/no – 4 -item SURE instrument) information was collected from the patient. One-year follow-up health status information was collected by phone interview. Median odds ratios were calculated to quantify the level of site variability. A multivariable logistic regression model was constructed to examine the association between <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and primary PAD treatment strategy (invasive vs. non-invasive). A multivariable linear regression model was built to examine the association between <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and 1 -year PAQ summary scores, while adjusting for baseline PAQ summary scores. Results: The unadjusted median odds ratio (MOR) for site variability was 2. 01 (95 % CI 1. 56 - 3. 13; p< 0. 001), after adjusting for country, the MOR was 1. 12 (95 % CI 1. 00 - 1. 46; p= 0. 35). After adjustment for site and relevant patient covariates, <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> was associated with lower odds of receiving invasive treatment (OR= 0. 58; 95 % CI 0. 34 - 1. 00; p= 0. 050). <b>Decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> was also associated with lower 1 -year health status gains for the PAQ summary score (adjusted B=- 4. 72; 95 % CI - 9. 38;- 0. 06; p= 0. 047), even adjusting for primary PAD treatment strategy. Conclusion: One in five patients facing PAD treatment decisions experience <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict.</b> While there is considerable variation for the occurrence of <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict,</b> it is more common among non-US countries. As compared with patients who do not experience <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict,</b> those reporting conflict are more often managed non-invasively and experience lesser 1 -year health status gains, not entirely explained by the primary PAD treatment modality. Increasing knowledge and support for non-invasive PAD treatment options may be ways to reduce <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> in PAD. Introduction [...] Methods [...] Results [...] Discussio...|$|E

METHOD: A prospective {{study examined}}treatment decision making and psychological dis-tress in {{a convenience sample of}} Chinese womenrecently diagnosed with early-stage breast cancer(BC). Totally 195 (93 % response rate) women withBC recruited from a major Hong Kong breastcentre were assessed at 3 days after the initialdiagnostic consultation (Baseline) and at 1 -monthfollowing BC surgery (Follow-up). DecisionalConﬂict was assessed at Baseline, whereas DecisionRegret, Psychological Distress, Physical SymptomDistress, and Optimism were assessed at Follow-up. Forced-entry multiple regression analysestested the mediating eﬀect of decision regret onthe relationship between <b>decisional</b> <b>conﬂict</b> anddistress. RESULTS: The average age of the womenwas 53 years old. Half of the women hadmastectomy and 31 % had breast conserving surgery. Higher <b>decisional</b> <b>conﬂict</b> (b 5. 20, p 5. 008) resulted in higher regret (F(1, 184) 5 7. 24, p 5. 008). Higher <b>decisional</b> <b>conﬂict</b> (b 5. 142, p 5. 014) alsoresulted in greater distress at 1 -month post-surgery(F(3, 142) 5 37. 05, po. 001). After adjusting for the eﬀects of physical symptom distress, age, andoptimism, <b>decisional</b> <b>conﬂict</b> (b 5. 120, p 5. 037) and regret (b 5. 151, p 5. 008), explained 45 % ofthe variance in distress (F(5, 179) 5 31. 01, po. 001). The Sobel test indicated that regret was a mediatorof the eﬀect of <b>decisional</b> <b>conﬂict</b> on distress(z 5 2, 74, p 5. 003).

40|$|Background. Decision-making on {{reproductive}} {{issues is}} influenced by an interplay of individual, familial, medical, religious and socio-cultural factors. Women with chronic medical illnesses such an HIV infection and cancers are often fraught with <b>decisional</b> <b>conflicts</b> about child-bearing. With increase {{in the incidence of}} these illnesses as well as improvement in survival rates, {{there is a need to}} pay due attention to the issue of reproductive decision-making. Examining the prevalence and determinants of fertility desires in the two groups in a comparative manner would help bring to light perception of the medical community and the society in general on the two illnesses and the issue of motherhood. ^ Methods. Systematic literature search was undertaken using databases such as MEDLINE (PubMED), MEDLINE (Ovid), PsycInfo and Web of Science. Articles published in English and English language abstracts for foreign articles were included. Studies that explore ‘fertility desires’ as the outcome variable were included. Quantitative studies which have assessed the prevalence of fertility desires as well as qualitative studies which have provided a descriptive understanding of factors governing reproductive desires were included in the review. ^ Results. A total of 34 articles (29 studies examining HIV and 5 studies examining cancer in relation to fertility desires). Variables such as age, stage of illness, support of spouse and family, perception of the medical community and one’s own view of motherhood were key determinants among both groups. ^ Conclusion. There is a need for uniform, systematic research in this field. It is important that health care workers acknowledge these <b>decisional</b> <b>conflicts,</b> include them as part of the medical care of these patients and provide guidance with the right balance of information, practicality and compassion. ...|$|R

Due to their predator life, crocodilians deal with <b>decisional</b> <b>conflicts</b> emerging from concurrent stimuli. By testing young Crocodylus niloticus with sounds in the absence or presence of chemical stimuli, we show that (i) the prandial (feeding) state modulates the responsiveness of the animal to a congruent, i. e. food-related olfactory stimulus, (ii) the prandial state alters the responsiveness to an incongruent (independent of food) sound, (iii) fasted, but not sated, crocodiles display selective attention to socially relevant sounds over noise in presence of food odour.

40|$|ObjectiveAbdominal aortic {{aneurysm}} patients {{tend to be}} informed inconsistently and incompletely about their disorder and the treatment options open to them. The objective of this trial was to evaluate whether these patients are better informed and experience less <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> regarding their treatment options after viewing a decision aid. DesignA six-centre, randomised clinical trial comparing a decision aid plus regular information versus regular information from the surgeon. MethodsIncluded patients had recently been diagnosed with an asymptomatic abdominal {{aortic aneurysm}} at least 4  cm in diameter. The decision aid consisted of a one-time viewing of an interactive CD-ROM elaborating on elective surgery versus watchful waiting. Generally, the decision aid advised patients with aneurysms less than 5. 5  cm to agree to watchful waiting, for larger aneurysms the decision aid provided insight into the balance of benefit and harm of surgical and conservative approaches, taking into account age, co-morbidity {{and size of the}} aneurysm. The primary outcome was patient <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> measured at 1 month follow-up (<b>Decisional</b> <b>Conflict</b> Scale). Secondary outcomes were patient knowledge, anxiety and satisfaction. ResultsIn 178 aneurysm patients, <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> scores did not differ significantly between the decision aid and the regular information groups (22 vs. 24 on the 0 – 100 <b>Decisional</b> <b>Conflict</b> Scale; p = . 33).

This retrospective study evaluates whether the testing age should be above 25 years to prevent adverse effects such as regret or <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict,</b> by determining the percentage and characteristics of patients reporting these problems. 111 of 219 patients (51 %) tested for BRCA 1 / 2 mutations or Lynch syndrome between 18 and 25 years from July 1996 to February 2011, returned self-report surveys. Primary measures were regret, <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and family influence. Secondary measures included quality of life (QoL), coping style, impact of genetic testing, and risk perception. Median age was 27 [21 - 40] years, with 86 % female. 73 % was tested for BRCA 1 / 2, 27 % for Lynch syndrome. Only 3 % reported regret, however 39 % had moderate (32 %) to severe (7 %) <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict.</b> Regression analysis revealed that <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> was associated with more monitoring/neutral coping style (p < 0. 03) or paternal/no family mutation (p < 0. 02); there were no differences in QoL, impact or risk perception. 42 % were mutation carriers, showing equal <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> to non-carriers. 68 % would recommend testing < 25 years; 77 % desired surveillance < 25 years if a mutation carrier.

40|$|Shared {{decision-making}} {{has been}} described as allowing patients to gain more control over their life situation and feel less helpless. The aim of this systematic review was to describe the involvement of older patients in shared decision-making in community settings. In accordance with the systematic review method, a total of 2468 abstracts were read, after which nine quantitative studies were included. A qualitative thematic analysis was performed and two themes emerged; increased understanding of self-management and a desire to strengthen one’s position in relationship with professionals, both of which were essential for empowering older patients to participate in shared decision-making. Older patients’ shared decision-making was seen as a struggle to maintain their autonomy in different areas of everyday life. Emotional and psychological problems made their position more difficult. In order to empower them in relationships with Healthcare professionals, older patients require more knowledge (self-efficacy) and information about their illness, which could strengthen their position in the decision-making process.

40|$|Conflict at work {{is quickly}} {{classified}} as a "darkside" construct that has primarily negative, destructive, and aversive consequences to individual employees’ well-being and task performance, to citizenship behavior and performance in work teams, and to organizational fitness and survival chances. In this chapter, I review these and related research findings and examine under what conditions, and why, conflict tends to be primarily negative and destructive or, alternatively, positive and constructive. Questions that are asked and answered include "does it matter what the conflict is about?" and "to what extent does the way people manage their conflicts bring out positive and/or negative consequences?" and "what can be done, in terms of systems design, or training and development, to benefit from conflict at work and to put it to good use?" In addition to a closer examination of the possible functions of conflict at work, this chapter devotes a large section to conflict management. This chapter starts with a brief but necessary treatment of some definitional aspects, {{to set the stage}} and to clarify some issues left unclear in past work on organizational conflict. From this it follows, among other things, that this chapter is not about intrapersonal conflicts, in which an individual needs to decide between two equal positives or negatives—as in so-called <b>decisional</b> <b>conflicts,</b> role conflicts, or work-family conflicts. Also, it clarifies that social conflict needs to be distinguished from other "dark-side" constructs that plague organizations, including aggression, incivility, and deviance. Although these constructs are touched on, it is important to reemphasize that conflict need not involve intent to harm another party and need not cause negative outcomes. The second major section of this chapter is about conflict-management tendencies and practices, relating research to core theories of strategic choice such as Deutsch’s (1973) theory of cooperation and competition and Pruitt and Rubin’s (1986) dual concern theory. The section ends with a relatively brief treatment of Organizational Dispute Resolution (ODR) systems and more informal dispute resolution strategies applied by managers and organizational leaders. The third section explores the various functions, both positive and negative, of conflict at work. The fourth and final section concludes the chapter with some core conclusions, with a specific eye toward applied issues and possible advice to practitioners faced with conflicts in their workplace...|$|R
50|$|A common {{thought process}} and {{decision}} making framework however, can be fairly uniform {{as a part of}} ICZM around the world. To achieve the principles set out in sustainable types of management a step by step process can be adhered to. Firstly, issues and problems need to be identified and assessments of these need to be quantified. This first step will include integration between government, sectoral entities and local residents. The assessments also have to be broad in their application. Once the issues and problems have been identified and weighted, an effective management plan can be made. The plan will be specific to the area in question. Thirdly, the adoption of the plan can be carried out. They can be legally binding statutory plans, strategies or objectives which are generally quite powerful or they can be non-statutory processes and can act as a guide for future development. This duality is largely beneficial as the future can be taken into account, but still provide for a firm stance based in the present. The fourth step is implementation, this active phase includes; law enforcement, education, development etc. The implementation activities will be of course, be as unique as their environments and can take many forms. The last phase is evaluation of the whole process. The principles of sustainability mean that there is no ‘end state.’ ICZM is an ongoing process which should constantly readjust the equilibrium between economic development and the protection of the environment. Feedback is a crucial part of the process and allows for continued effectiveness even when a situation may change.Public participation and stakeholder involvement is essential in ICZM processes, {{not only in terms of}} a democratic approach, but also from a technical-instrumental point of view, in order to reduce <b>decisional</b> <b>conflicts</b> (Ioppolo et al., 2013).|$|R

Body image and psychological distress in nipple sparing mastectomy : the roles of self-compassion and appearance investment [...] Chapter 4. Study 2. <b>Decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and regret following nipple sparing mastectomy [...] Chapter 5. General discussion and conclusiomn. Women {{diagnosed with breast cancer}} often experience significant psychological distress from the time of diagnosis, as well as during and after their surgery. <b>Decisional</b> <b>conflict,</b> post-decision regret and body image disturbances have been shown to contribute to a woman's psychological distress and satisfaction with the outcome of her breast surgery. Nipple sparing mastectomy with immediate breast reconstruction (NSM+IBR) is a relatively new yet oncologically safe surgical technique that may help to minimise psychological distress from <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict,</b> regret and body image disturbances as it is a single-step procedure and preserves a woman's skin and areola complex. The current thesis is presented in three parts. First a literature review of research investigating the effects of surgery for breast cancer on a woman's body image and the relationship of body image with distress, <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and regret is presented. The second section of the thesis comprises two chapters corresponding to empirical work investigating:Study 1. Body image disturbance and psychological distress in women who have undergone NSM+IBR, inclusing investigation of the mediating effect of self-compassion, and the moderating effect of appearance investment on this body image-distress relationship via self-compassion. Study 2. <b>Decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and post-decision regret in NSM+IBR, as well as factors that are associated with increased levels of <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and regret, such as satisfaction with reconstructed breasts, physical and sexual well-being after breast surgery, partner reactions to the woman's reconstructed breasts and the importance a woman places on her partner's reaction. Methods: Women diagnosed with breast cancer (N= 80) who had previously undergone NSM+IBR completed online questionnaires including the Body Image Scale (Hopwood et al., 2001), Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scales (Lovibond & Lovibond, 1992), Impact of Event Scale (Horowitz et al., 1979), Self-Compassion Scale (Short Form; Raes et al., 2011), Appearance Schemas Inventory (Revised; Cash et al., 2004), <b>Decisional</b> <b>Conflict</b> Scale (O’Connor, 1995), Decision Regret Scale (Brehaut, 2003), BREAST-Q (Pusic et al., 2009) and a measure of perceived partner reactions and the importance placed on this reaction (scale designed specifically for the current study). Results:Study 1 : Mean scores on general and cancer-specific psychological distress were within normal ranges and body image disturbance was moderately low. Body image was positively correlated with depression, stress, impact of event scale scores and appearance investment, and negatively correlated with self-compassion. Bootstrap moderated mediation analyses indicated a significant indirect (mediating) effect of self-compassion (depression, anxiety, stress) but only for women with high levels of appearance investment. Study 2 : Mean scores on <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and regret indicated {{that the majority of the}} current sample experienced low levels of <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and regret, although 15 % indicated high levels of conflict, and 20 % reported moderate to strong regret. Simple linear regression analyses indicated that the extent to which a woman cared about her partner’s reaction to her reconstructed breasts uniquely contributed to <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict,</b> while a woman’s satisfaction with her reconstructed breasts uniquely contributed to decision regret. No other factors were associated with conflict or regret. Conclusions: Findings suggest that NSM+IBR may minimise the adverse psychological impacts of mastectomy, with the majority of the current sample experiencing low levels of psychological distress, body image disturbance, <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and decision regret. However, NSM+IBR is not an available option for all women undergoing mastectomy. As such, identifying women high in appearance investment and low in self-compassion may be of particular clinical relevance for identifying women who are at greater risk for poorer psychological adjustment post-surgery. Additionally, recognition of factors that contribute to <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and regret, such as the importance placed by a woman on her partner’s reaction to her reconstructed breasts, and her satisfaction with her reconstructed breasts, respectively, may assist with interventions aimed at reducing <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and regret. The research documented in the current thesis may, therefore, be of particular relevance for clinicians engaged in supportive psychological interventions dedicated to women who have undergone breast surgery by: i) providing additional support to women identified as at risk for greater distress; ii) assisting clinicians in modifying existing breast surgery body image interventions for the most favourable outcome (e. g., by including psycho-education and practice on increasing self-compassion and lowering appearance investment); iii) routinely involving partners in the decision-making process to help reduce <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and post-decision regret; and iv) working with women on their expectations of the outcome of surgery.

40|$|Abstract Background A {{major change}} has {{occurred}} {{in the last few years}} in the therapeutic approach to patients presenting with all forms of acute coronary syndromes. Whether or not these patients present initially to tertiary cardiac care centers, they are now routinely referred for early coronary angiography and increasingly undergo percutaneous revascularization. This practice is driven primarily by the angiographic image and technical feasibility. Concomitantly, there has been a decline in expectant or ischemia-guided medical management based on specific clinical presentation, response to initial treatment, and results of noninvasive stratification. This 'tertiarization' of acute coronary care has been fuelled by the increasing sophistication of the cardiac armamentarium, the peer-reviewed publication of clinical studies purporting to show the superiority of invasive cardiac interventions, and predominantly supporting (non-peer-reviewed) editorials, newsletters, and opinion pieces. Discussion This review presents another perspective, based on a critical reexamination of the evidence. The topics addressed are: reperfusion treatment of ST-elevation myocardial infarction; the indications for invasive intervention following thrombolysis; the role of invasive management in non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction and unstable angina; and cost-effectiveness and real world considerations. A few cases encountered in recent practice in community and tertiary hospitals are presented for illustrative purposes The numerous and far-reaching scientific, economic, and philosophical implications that are a consequence of this marked change in clinical practice as well as healthcare, <b>decisional</b> and <b>conflict</b> of interest issues are explored. Summary The weight of evidence does not support the contemporary unfocused broad use of invasive interventional procedures across the spectrum of acute coronary clinical presentations. Excessive and unselective recourse to these procedures has deleterious implications for the organization of cardiac health care and undesirable economic, scientific and intellectual consequences. It is suggested that there is need for a new equilibrium based on more refined clinical risk stratification in the treatment of patients who present with acute coronary syndromes. </p...|$|R

In this paper, we synthesize theories and empirical findings from the psychology of judgment and choice to provide a new theoretical explanation for such user preferences. Our argument centers on the assertion that the MCDM method preferred by decision makers {{is a function of the}} degree to which the method tends to introduce <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict.</b> The model we develop relates response mode, decision strategy, and the salience of <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> to user preferences among decision aids.

40|$|A Dutch online patient {{decision}} aid {{to support}} prosthetic heart valve selection was recently developed. A multicenter randomized controlled trial {{was conducted to}} assess whether use of the patient decision aid results in optimization of shared decision making in prosthetic heart valve selection. In a 5 -center randomized controlled trial, patients were allocated to receive either standard preoperative care (control group) or additional access to the patient decision aid (intervention group). Legally capable adult patients accepted for elective isolated or combined aortic and mitral valve replacement were included. Primary outcome was preoperative <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> (<b>Decisional</b> <b>Conflict</b> Scale); secondary outcomes included patient knowledge, involvement in valve selection, anxiety and depression, (valve-specific) quality of life, and regret. Out of 306 eligible patients, 155 were randomized (78 control and 77 intervention). Preoperative <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> did not differ between the groups (34 % versus 33 %; P= 0. 834). Intervention patients felt better informed (median <b>Decisional</b> <b>Conflict</b> Scale informed subscore: 8 versus 17; P= 0. 046) and had a better knowledge of prosthetic valves (85 % versus 68 %; P= 0. 004). Intervention patients experienced less anxiety and depression (median Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale score: 6 versus 9; P= 0. 015) and better mental well-being (mean Short Form Health Survey score: 54 versus 50; P= 0. 032). Three months postoperatively, valve-specific {{quality of life and}} regret did not differ between the groups.

40|$|Patient {{decision}} aids facilitate treatment decisions. They {{are often}} evaluated {{in terms of}} their effect on <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict,</b> as measured by the <b>Decisional</b> <b>Conflict</b> Scale (DCS). It is unclear to what extent lower DCS scores are accompanied by observable patient behavior or emotions. To help interpret DCS scores. In a Dutch university hospital, statements on behaviors or emotions during decision making were collected from asymptomatic aneurysm patients and healthy employees. Subsequently, they rated the intensity of <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> that each statement expresses on a 1 to 10 scale. Selected statements were prospectively tested in aneurysm patients and cancer patients facing treatment dilemmas. Associations between patients' DCS scores and reported behavior and emotions were analyzed using logistic regression analysis. Participants provided 363 statements on behaviors and emotions during decision making, of which 28 were mentioned more than 4 times. Nine forms of behavior and emotions were selected as they were graded with the least variable median ratings of intensity of <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict.</b> Among 100 patients facing a treatment dilemma, each point increase in DCS lowered their odds for "immediately making the decision" (odds ratio [OR], 0. 96; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 0. 93 - 0. 98), whereas the odds of "fretting regularly" (OR, 1. 05; 95 % CI, 1. 02 - 1. 08) and "feeling nervous when thinking of the decision" (OR, 1. 04; 95 % CI, 1. 01 - 1. 06) where higher.

40|$|Background. The <b>Decisional</b> <b>Conflict</b> Scale (DCS) is {{a useful}} {{clinical}} tool in assessing the health care consumers' decisional needs. However, the exact predictive ability of the DCS is unknown. Objective. To examine the DCS as a proxy measure for patients' knowledge level and {{as a predictor of}} downstream effects of high <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict,</b> specifically, decision delay, discontinuance of chosen option, and decisional regret. Design. Meta-analyses with individual data from 10 clinical trials using the following statistics: descriptive statistics, correlation analysis and logistic regression. Results. Patients' knowledge deficit has a fair association with the uninformed subscale of the DCS (OR 3. 10; 95 % CI 1. 58 - 6. 05). Patients' decisional delay has a very strong association with the DCS (OR 23. 81; 4. 66 - 121. 51). Patients' discontinuance of chosen treatment has a varied association with the DCS, very strong for change from status quo (OR 59. 37; 4. 09 - 861. 05) and fair for change from active treatment (OR 3. 39; 1. 42 - 8. 00). Patients' decisional regret has a strong association with the DCS (OR 5. 52; 3. 35 - 9. 12). Conclusion. When clinicians assess a patient's <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> after counselling, and they find the <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> is low, they can be reasonably assured that the likelihood of downstream decision delay, change from the status quo, or decisional regret will be low. However, low scores on the uninformed scale do not guarantee the patient is well informed; they need to validate the patients' understanding with some follow-up questions. Moreover, the likelihood of discontinuing active treatment even with low <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> is also a possibility...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of a web based decision aid versus a leaflet versus, usual practice in reducing parents' <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> for the first dose MMR vaccination decision. The, impact on MMR vaccine uptake was also explored. DESIGN: Three-arm cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Fifty GP practices in the north of, England. PARTICIPANTS: 220 first time parents making a first dose MMR decision. INTERVENTIONS: Web, based MMR decision aid plus usual practice, MMR leaflet plus usual practice versus usual practice only, (control). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: <b>Decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> was the primary outcome and used as the, measure of parents' levels of informed decision-making. MMR uptake was a secondary outcome. RESULTS: <b>Decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> decreased post-intervention for both intervention arms to a level where, parents could make an informed MMR decision (decision aid: effect estimate= 1. 09, 95 % CI - 1. 36 to - 0. 82; information leaflet: effect estimate=- 0. 67, 95 % CI - 0. 88 to - 0. 46). Trial arm was significantly, associated (p< 0. 001) with <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> at post-intervention. Vaccination uptake was 100 %, 91 %, and 99 % in the decision aid, leaflet and control arms, respectively (χ(2) (1, N= 203) = 8. 69; p= 0. 017). Post-hoc tests revealed a statistically significant difference in uptake between the information leaflet, and the usual practice arms (p= 0. 04), and a near statistically significant difference between the, decision aid and leaflet arms (p= 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: Parents' <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> was reduced in both, the decision aid and leaflet arms. The decision aid also prompted parents to act upon that decision and, vaccinate their child.

40|$|Purpose: <b>Decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> is a {{significant}} and important barrier in end-of-life care planning, and it is often encountered in health professionals' discussions with patients and their families. Little {{is known about the}} measurement of <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict,</b> and existing measures are not suitable for all contexts. In this study, psychometric properties of the <b>Decisional</b> <b>Conflict</b> Scale, which was translated for the first time into Korean [Korean version of DCS (K-DCS) ], were examined. Methods: A sample of 273 community-dwelling elders was surveyed (mean age: 77. 26  years; 80. 2 % women). Internal consistency reliability and stability reliability were tested by calculating Cronbach α and Pearson's correlation coefficients. Exploratory factor analysis and logistic regression analyses were performed to test validity. Results: Reliability of the K-DCS was acceptable with Cronbach α =. 87; test-retest correlation r = . 76. Factor analysis showed a two-factor structure with nine items: informed/values clarity and uncertainty. Concordance between K-DCS and the four treatment directives was significant (kappa values ≥. 78). Controlling for age and gender, those with decision implementation were more likely to implement their decisions on tube feeding (odds ratio =  5. 15, p = . 033) and hospice care (odds ratio =  2. 83, p = . 017).

40|$|As {{the aging}} {{population}} in the nation increases, cancer diagnoses {{in this age group}} will also increase. The many chronic medical conditions associated with older adults are confounded by a diagnosis of cancer. Older adults with cancer are at risk for physical, psychological, and functional decline as a result of not only the cancer, but also the cancer treatment. In their current research agenda, the Oncology Nursing Society identified the need for research related to multiple comorbidities in older adults with cancer. This study utilized a cross-sectional, descriptive, correlational study design to explore the relationships between and among treatment-related <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict,</b> quality of life, and comorbidity in older adults with cancer. Oncology nurses recruited a sample size of 200 for this study from outpatient medical oncology, radiation oncology, and palliative care practices. Using an anonymous survey method, participants completed three psychometrically-sound instruments, including the <b>Decisional</b> <b>Conflict</b> Scale, Self-Administered Comorbidity Questionnaire, and the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire. Bivariate relationships existed between increased levels of <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and increased quality of life (p =. 009) and quality of life and comorbidity (p =. 001). All six regression models achieved significance (p 3 ̆c. 001). Statistically significant relationships were identified in each of the six regression models. Positive relationships existed between <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and financial problems, physical function, and global health status/quality of life. Increased emotional function may be predictive of decreased <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> in all of the regression models. Other negative relationships existed between <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and cognitive function, diarrhea, spiritual support, insomnia, year diagnosed, fatigue, and nausea/vomiting. With their focus on patient-centered care, oncology nurses are a crucial component of the multidisciplinary cancer team that can empower older cancer patients to communicate their values and preferences regarding cancer treatment. Additionally, this study underscores the importance of oncology nurses being prepared to provide high-quality care to geriatric patients with multiple comorbidities. Given the paucity of research on the impact of cancer and its treatment on older adults, there are no published studies that address all of these variables. In light of the regression analyses, further research is needed with regard to emotional function, spiritual support, and symptom management in the setting of decision making in older adults with cancer.

40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} effects of {{pharmacist}} consultation versus a decision aid on women's <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> regarding use of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and subsequent satisfaction with the decision-making process. Setting: A family medicine clinic in Canada. Method: The study was a prospective, randomised comparative trial. Peri- and post-menopausal female patients aged 48 to 52 years were invited to participate. Volunteers (n = 128) received either a private consultation with a pharmacist or a take-home decision aid. Data collection was undertaken prior to the intervention and again following an appointment with a physician to discuss HRT. Outcome: measures included: perception of being informed about HRT, <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict,</b> satisfaction with the education and the decision made regarding HRT, and adherence to HRT if prescribed. Telephone follow-up occurred three and 12 months after the physician appointment. Key findings: After discussing HRT with their physicians, 35 of 91 women (38. 5 %) chose HRT, 15 (16. 5 %) declined it and 41 (45. 1 %) opted to delay their decision. Both interventions significantly increased women's perception of being informed about this form of therapy and decreased <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict.</b> Satisfaction with the education and with the HRT decision was high.

40|$|Rationale: We {{developed}} an evidence-based decision aid {{for patients with}} advanced cystic fibrosis considering referral for lung transplantation. Objectives: To prospectively evaluate whether use of the decision aid increased knowledge about the options, improved realistic expectations, and decreased <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> in adult patients. Methods: We performed a single-blind randomized controlled trial involving 149 adult patients with cystic fibrosis with an FEV₁ ≤ 40 % predicted from 14 Canadian and Australian centers. All participants received an education and counseling session from their cystic fibrosis team and were then randomized to receive the decision aid or usual care. The decision aid is available online at [URL] Measurements and Main Results: The primary end points measured were participants’ knowledge, realistic expectations, and <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> evaluated 3 weeks after randomization. Patients randomized to the decision aid had greater knowledge about their options (P< 0. 0001) and had more realistic expectations about the benefits and risks of lung transplantation (P< 0. 0001) compared with those randomized to usual care.

40|$|Background: Deciding {{whether or}} not to have breast {{reconstruction}} following breast cancer diagnosis is a complex decision process. This randomized controlled trial assessed the impact of an online decision aid [Breast RECONstruction Decision Aid (BRECONDA) ] on breast reconstruction decision-making. Methods: Women (n = 222) diagnosed with breast cancer or ductal carcinoma in situ, and eligible for reconstruction following mastectomy, completed an online baseline questionnaire. They were then assigned randomly to receive either standard online information about breast reconstruction (control) or standard information plus access to BRECONDA (intervention). Participants then completed questionnaires at 1 and 6 months after randomization. The primary outcome was participants' <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> 1 month after exposure to the intervention. Secondary outcomes included <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> at 6 months, satisfaction with information at 1 and 6 months, and 6 -month decisional regret. Results: Linear mixed-model analyses revealed that 1 -month <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> was significantly lower in the intervention group (27. 18) compared with the control group (35. 5). This difference was also sustained at the 6 -month follow-up. Intervention participants reported greater satisfaction with information at 1 - and 6 -month follow-up, and there was a nonsignificant trend for lower decisional regret in the intervention group at 6 -month follow-up. Intervention participants' ratings for BRECONDA demonstrated high user acceptability and overall satisfaction. Conclusions: Women who accessed BRECONDA benefited by experiencing significantly less <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and being more satisfied with information regarding the reconstruction decisional process than women receiving standard care alone.

40|$|STUDY QUESTION: How do female {{patients}} experience fertility preservation (FP) consultation (FPC) with {{a specialist}} in reproductive medicine and subsequent decision-making on FP? SUMMARY ANSWER: Most patients had positive experiences with FPC, but negative experiences {{were found to be}} associated with <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and decision regret. WHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY: When confronted with a need for gonadotoxic treatment, girls and young women will have to make an irreversible decision with regard to FP. Patients may experience <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and develop regret about their decision during follow-up. Patients' opportunities to ask questions during FPC and their knowledge about FP have been inversely related to <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict.</b> STUDY DESIGN, SIZE, DURATION: A questionnaire on experiences with FPC, designed after qualitative research, was retrospectively distributed to 108 patients to whom FP was offered after FPC between July 2008 and July 2013. Aiming to minimize recall bias, we defined a subgroup of patients counselled since 2011 who had not yet tried to conceive after FPC. PARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING, METHODS: Patients were aged >/= 16 years and had either cancer or a benign disease that required gonadotoxic therapy. They received FPC in a single university hospital in the Netherlands. Apart from patients' experiences, patients' characteristics, <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> and decision regret were assessed. MAIN RESULTS AND ROLE OF CHANCE: A total of 64 patients (59. 3 %) responded to the questionnaire. Patients generally had positive experiences with FPC, but indicated room for improvement. Negative experiences were associated with <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> regarding the FP decision (not enough time for counselling: P < 0. 0001; not having the opportunity to ask all questions during FPC: P < 0. 0001; not feeling supported by the counsellor during decision-making: P = 0. 0003; not all applicable options were discussed: P = 0. 0001; benefits and disadvantages of FP options were not clearly explained: P = 0. 0005). <b>Decisional</b> <b>conflict</b> was correlated to decision regret (P < 0. 0001). In the subgroup of patients counselled after 2011 who had not tried to conceive (n = 33), similar results as for the total study population were found for the association of patient experiences with <b>decisional</b> <b>conflict.</b> LIMITATIONS, REASONS FOR CAUTION: Given our retrospective design, we were not informed about the causality of the associations observed. We studied Dutch patients who were counselled in a single centre and were at least 16 years old when filling in the questionnaire. This may limit the generalizability of our data to other settings and populations. WIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS: More attention should be paid to improving FPC care. Interventions aiming at improving patients' comprehension of the topic of FP and their feelings of being supported in decision-making are advisable.
