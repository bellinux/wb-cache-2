40|$|In many organisations, {{air travel}} is an {{essential}} part of conducting business in order to meet company objectives and goals. The selection of a preferred airline is a complex undertaking. Corporations may obtain discounts based on expenditure commitments; the airline may have a <b>frequent</b> <b>flyer</b> programme; or a low cost carrier may offer a better alternative to full service carriers. The literature on corporate travel is fairly limited with determinants determining the selection of airlines having been studied from other perspectives such as the business traveller, thus, this study should make a significant contribution to this field by generating new information on corporate travel and in particular corporate air travel decisions. The literature review provides a demarcation of the broad concepts of the buying approach towards corporate air travel. Also discussed is the relationship between the key role players in airline selection: the corporate traveller; the travel management company; and the airline. Various determinants of airline selection by corporations are identified and the role of <b>frequent</b> <b>flyer</b> <b>programmes</b> is analysed. Furthermore, the move towards low-cost airlines as a preferred choice for corporate travel is investigated. The empirical phase of the research study focussed on identifying the determinants of airline selection by large-sized corporations in South Africa; the relative importance of <b>frequent</b> <b>flyer</b> programmes; and the move towards low-cost airlines as a preferred choice for corporate travel. The target population was sampled using a non-probability convenience sampling approach with a newly designed quantitative, ex post facto web-based questionnaire, distributed via e-mail to the target population. Exploratory factor analysis was done to identify whether an underlying structure of airline selection determinants exists from which the relative importance of <b>frequent</b> <b>flyer</b> <b>programmes</b> could be assessed. From the results, a model of corporate airline selection determinants was derived. Then, the model was compared to the conceptual model formulated from the literature survey. A number of important selection determinants were identified, and it became evident that <b>frequent</b> <b>flyer</b> <b>programmes</b> are, generally, not considered a decisive determinant in the selection of a preferred airline by corporations. However, the influence of low-cost airlines was shown to be considerable, in line with the endeavour to save on air travel expenses within a corporate air travel management programme. The findings should assist both corporations and airlines with the design of their air travel buying approaches and marketing strategies respectively.

40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to contribute to a better theoretical and empirical knowledge about the way <b>frequent</b> <b>flyer</b> <b>programmes</b> influence customer behaviour. It aims to describe the relationships between purchase orientations and personalized rewards on customers' perceived programme value and subsequent loyalty. Design/methodology/approach - The research uses self-determination theory (SDT) and purchase orientations to classify types of rewards in terms of their effect on perceived programme value and loyalty. Scales are developed through exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. To validate the hypotheses, surveys are realized in a major international airline. Structural equation modelling confirms the research model. Findings - Perceived value and loyalty vary according to purchase orientation, in support of the SDT. Intrinsic (extrinsic) rewards motivate customers to act to obtain a benefit within (apart from) the target of their purchase orientation and influences loyalty positively (have low impact on loyalty). Research limitations/implications - Further testing of reward types, in(ex) trinsic motivation, SDT, across multiple contexts is necessary for validity enhancement. Practical implications - Differentiation through tailored (non-) monetary rewards is possible in markets marked by strong competition to appeal to different segments. Originality/value - This is one of the pioneer articles in the use of SDT in marketing research.

30|$|The {{effects of}} new entry on price {{dispersion}} {{are even more}} difficult to analyse. In a seminal paper, Borenstein and Rose [10] find that routes with higher levels of competition are characterized by a greater degree of price dispersion. Gerardi and Shapiro [11], on the other hand, find that dispersion decreases with the level of competition. They also make the theoretical argument that dispersion depends on the ability of airlines to mark up fares and/or price-discriminate. 1 They argue that when new carriers enter a market, increased competition restricts these strategies and therefore the dispersion should decrease. An alternative theory predicts that price dispersion actually derives from incumbent brand loyalty: new entrants try to attract price-conscious customers by offering lower prices, but this strategy has little effect on the existing base of high-paying customers (with <b>frequent</b> <b>flyer</b> <b>programmes).</b> In this scenario, a positive relationship exists between price dispersion and competitive intensity. Martin & Koo [12], in their analysis of daily fares offered on 1, 000 U.S. domestic routes, find that price dispersion is positively influenced by the presence of low-cost carriers but not by the intensity of competition. Dana [13] shows that if individual and aggregate demand are uncertain price dispersion may characterise pricing strategies of firms even if they have no market power.|$|R
40|$|Airline alliances {{dominate}} {{the air transport}} industry with the largest carriers belonging {{to one of the}} four alliance groupings—Wings, 1 Star Alliance, oneworld, SkyTeam—which represent 56 % of world revenue passenger kilometers. Although much research has been carried out to evaluate the impact of alliance membership on performance of airlines, little has been done on the perceived impacts by participating airlines. This paper gathers opinions of all the airlines, belonging to the four global alliances in 2002 on the impact alliances have had on their traffic and on their performance in general. To achieve this, a comprehensive survey of the alliance management departments of airlines participating in the alliances was carried out. The survey examined which type of cooperation among carriers (<b>frequent</b> <b>flyer</b> <b>programmes,</b> code share, strategic alliance without antitrust immunity, strategic alliance with antitrust immunity) have produced the most positive impact on traffic and which types of route (short haul, long haul, hub–hub, hub–non-hub, non-hub–non-hub) have been affected the most. In addition, the respondent airlines quantified the effect alliances have had on specific areas of their operation, such as load factors, traffic, costs, revenue and fares. Their responses are analysed by alliance groupings, under airline and under geographic region to establish which group, type of carrier and geographic region has benefited the most. The results show that each of the four global alliances groupings has experienced different results according to the type of collaboration agreed amongst their member airlines...|$|R
40|$|Airlines employ <b>frequent</b> <b>flyer</b> <b>programmes</b> (FFPs) {{to enhance}} their {{competitiveness}} and retain loyal and profitable customers. There has been some debate on the continued effectiveness of FFPs and industry and academia have questioned {{the extent to which}} FFPs are still capable of enhancing loyalty among their members. This study looks at Business Class travellers, both members and non-members of a FFP who travel frequently on the same airline, and aims to measure their level of loyalty, {{while at the same time}} ascertaining whether a difference exists between members and non-members. An online questionnaire is used to measure the level of loyalty of 2 050 frequent business class travellers. Results show no significant difference between members and non-members of the FFP in terms of their level of compound loyalty displayed towards the airline. It also found that a higher tier of membership does not necessarily display a higher level of loyalty. These results indicate that equating specific tier membership of a loyalty programme to a high level of loyalty towards an airline cannot be generally accepted. Recommendations flowing from the research would include that the tier-structure of FFPs may need to be reconsidered to achieve the actual benefits for which they were created. The findings also imply that members of the FFP are not necessarily more loyal than non-members and calls for an in-depth analysis to establish which mediating factors within the loyalty programme will have an inducing effect on the level of loyalty towards the airline.
