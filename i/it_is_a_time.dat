25|$|Like {{the holiday}} of Sukkot, the {{intermediary}} days of Passover {{are known as}} Chol HaMoed (festival weekdays) and are imbued with a semi-festive status. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> for family outings and picnic lunches of matzo, hardboiled eggs, fruits and vegetables, and Passover treats such as macaroons and homemade candies.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these festivals, ceremonies marking rites of passage are also performed within the shrines. Two such ceremonies are {{the birth of a}} child and the Shichi-Go-San. When a child is born they are brought to a shrine so that they can be initiated as a new believer and the kami can bless them and their future life. The Shichi-Go-San (the Seven-Five-Three) is a rite of passage for five-year-old boys and three- or seven-year-old girls. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> for these young children to personally offer thanks for the kami’s protection and to pray for continued health.|$|E

25|$|Mental {{prayer was}} defined by Fr. John Hardon in his Modern Catholic Dictionary {{as a form of}} prayer in which the sentiments {{expressed}} are one's own and not those of another person. Mental prayer is a form of prayer whereby one loves God through dialogue with him, meditating on his words, and contemplating him. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of silence focused on God and one's relationship with him. It is distinguished from vocal prayers which use set prayers, although mental prayer can proceed by using vocal prayers in order to improve dialogue with God. Mental prayer can be divided into meditation, or active mental prayer; and contemplation, passive mental prayer.|$|E
25|$|Messianic Jews {{and some}} other sabbatarian churches also observe Yom Kippur as a holy day, from evening to evening. In the Christian observance, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of prayer and fasting from all food and drink and a time of {{instruction}} through study and church attendance. It focuses on Christ's sacrifice and atonement for sins. It {{is seen as a}} time to give thanks and praise, to humble oneself and to seek repentance. It is also a time where Messianic Jews pray for Israel and Jews who have not yet proclaimed Yeshua/Jesus is the Messiah that was promised in prophesies from the Old Testament.|$|E
25|$|According to Clayton Christensen, {{disruptive}} innovation {{is the key}} to future success in business. The organisation requires a proper structure in order to retain competitive advantage. It is necessary to create and nurture an environment of innovation. Executives and managers need to break away from traditional ways of thinking and use change to their advantage. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of risk but even greater opportunity. The world of work is changing with the increase in the use of technology and both companies and businesses are becoming increasingly competitive. Companies will have to downsize and re-engineer their operations to remain competitive. This will affect employment as businesses will be forced {{to reduce the number of}} people employed while accomplishing the same amount of work if not more.|$|E

25|$|Celtic Reconstructionist Pagans (or CRs) often {{celebrate}} Samhain on {{the date}} of first frost, or when {{the last of the}} harvest is in and the ground is dry enough to have a bonfire. Some follow the old tradition of building two bonfires, which celebrants and livestock then walk or dance between as a ritual of purification. For CRs, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when the dead are especially honoured. Though CRs make offerings at all times of the year, Samhain is a time when more elaborate offerings are made to specific ancestors. This may involve making a small shrine. Often there will be a meal, where a place for the dead is set at the table and they are invited to join. Traditional tales may be told and traditional songs, poems and dances performed. A western-facing door or window may be opened and a candle left burning on the windowsill to guide the dead home. Divination for the coming year is often done, whether in all solemnity or as games for the children. The more mystically inclined may also see this as a time for deeply communing with their deities, especially those seen as being particularly linked with this festival.|$|E
500|$|The Antoinism worship {{takes place}} in temples. A dressed member welcomes anyone who enters the temple by calling them [...] "brother" [...] and [...] "sister", {{even if they are}} just visitors. The service is very unceremonial and informal, as there is no liturgy, singing, or pre-set prayers, and lasts from 15 to 30 minutes. Attendance at worship is not {{required}} and many people come sporadically. According to sociologist Régis Dericquebourg, [...] "the Antoinist worship is a ritual of intercession. (...) <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of big emotional intensity with an intimate aspect".|$|E

2500|$|The Restoration is {{an unusual}} {{historical}} period, as its literature is bounded by a specific political event: {{the restoration of the}} Stuart monarchy. It is unusual in another way, as well, for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when the influence of that king's presence and personality permeated literary society to such an extent that, almost uniquely, literature reflects the court. The adversaries of the restoration, the Puritans and democrats and republicans, similarly respond to the peculiarities of the king and the king's personality. Therefore, a top-down view of the literary history of the Restoration has more validity than that of most literary epochs. [...] "The Restoration" [...] as a critical concept covers the duration of the effect of Charles and Charles's manner. This effect extended beyond his death, in some instances, and not as long as his life, in others.|$|E
