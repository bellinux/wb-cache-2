50|$|<b>Daytime</b> <b>reception</b> of {{overseas}} shortwave and longwave time signal services in Australia (and New Zealand) is rather poor as the nearest HF (and longwave) time signal services are BPM (China), JJY (Japan) and WWVH (Hawaii, USA).|$|E
5000|$|The Benghazi station used {{an improvised}} studio at its {{transmitting}} station, as its studio headquarters were burnt down by protesters {{in the early}} days of the revolution. [...] None of the stations operated a website. However, in early April 2011, a live internet stream of the Benghazi station was established independently by a political activist, relaying off-air reception of the 675 AM signal. The location where the activist was receiving the 675 AM signal was not disclosed, though it must have been within Libya or its immediate vicinity as it had <b>daytime</b> <b>reception</b> of the signal by ground wave propagation.|$|E
50|$|Although {{designed}} {{just for}} campus, in <b>daytime</b> <b>reception</b> was now possible throughout Colchester, however {{this could not}} be advertised {{under the terms of}} the licence. This transmitter - again, by Wireless Workshop - was initially sited by Bertram Russell tower. This, on a hill by water, was one of the best possible AM transmission sites in Essex. The 1602 kHz LPAM mast had to be moved in 2003 to accommodate new student residences, and was sited behind the Sports Hall. Although in the tradition of URE, 999 kHz on induction loops was maintained as backup. URE closed 999 kHz in 2001 due to the extra costs of two AM licences.|$|E

40|$|Performance {{uncertainties}} for a 10 -m optical reception station {{may arise}} from {{the nature of the}} communications channel or from a specific technology choice. Both types of uncertainties are described in this article to develop an understanding of the limitations imposed by them and to provide a rational basis for making technical decisions. The performance at night will be considerably higher than for <b>daytime</b> <b>reception...</b>|$|E
40|$|The OMEGA {{transmissions}} from North Dakota on 13. 10 and 12. 85 kHz were monitored {{at several}} sites using a recently developed OMEGA timing receiver {{specifically designed for}} this purpose. The experiments were conducted at Goddard Space Flight Center, Greenbelt, Maryland; U. S. Naval Observatory, Washington, D. C.; and at the NASA tracking station, Rosman, North Carolina. Results show that cycle identification of the two carrier frequencies was made at each test site, thus, coarse time (76 microseconds) from the OMEGA transmitted signals to within the ambiguity period of each OMEGA frequency was extracted. The fine time determination, which was extracted from the phase difference between the received OMEGA signals and locally generated signals, was about + or - 2 microseconds for <b>daytime</b> <b>reception</b> and about + or - 5 microseconds for nighttime reception...|$|E
40|$|The {{capacity}} is determined for an optical channel employing Pulse Position Modulation (PPM) and an Avalanche PhotoDiode (APD) detector. This channel {{is different from}} the usual optical channel in that the detector output is characterized by a Webb-plus-Gaussian distribution, not a Poisson distribution. The {{capacity is}} expressed {{as a function of the}} PPM order, slot width, laser dead time, average number of incident signal and background photons received, and APD parameters. Based on a system using a laser and detector proposed for X 2000 second delivery, numerical results provide upper bounds on the data rate, level of background noise, and code rate that the channel can support while operating at a given BER. For the particular case studied, the capacity-maximizing PPM order is near 2048 for nighttime reception and 16 for <b>daytime</b> <b>reception.</b> Reed-Solomon codes can handle background levels 2. 3 to 7. 6 dB below the ultimate level that can be handled by codes operating at the Shannon limit. 1...|$|E
