The saying, "It isn't the mountains ahead that wear you out—It's the grain of sand in your shoe " (Priest, 1974), is an apt statement for teachers to reflect upon in their careers as exceptional educators. Not only must teachers meet their students ' needs, organize and present interesting lessons, and manage student behavior (the mountains), but they also must make decisions about bathroom breaks, sharpening pencils, and other mundane mat-ters (the grain of sand) that make a classroom run smoothly. These routine matters revolve around the following questions, adapted from a Florida Diagnostic and Learning Resource-Action Center publication (Staff, 1983) : 1. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>plan</b> to begin the day or period? 2. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>plan</b> to end the day or period? 3.

What {{factors in the}} physical environment is it {{that make you feel}} comfortable in some of the places in the city, but in other places not comfortable at all? Why do some cities have a rich public life in their public realm, while the public realm in other cities is abandoned and empty? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>plan</b> environments that support people’s physical and mental health? These are questions that I put to myself, and that people who are interested in or working with physical planning should ask themselves. That is why I have been studying an authority on the subject, the Danish Professor Jan Gehl, who has been researching and working with peoplefriendly public realms for 50 years. He {{is best known for his}} book Life between buildings that has been a text-book in the education of architects for more than 30 years, and to have initiated Copenhagens most famous pedestrian street, Strøget, to show his theory of how people will use the public realm, if it’s only got the right qualities. The project showed positive results, and was expanded to include other streets in the citycentre of Copenhagen. Today he is the owner of, together with Helle Søholt, the architecht’s office ‘Gehl Architechts – Urban Quality Consultants’. Together with their 41 employees they broadcast their knowledge in building socially sustainable cities. The forms for their work is speaking at big scale conferences as well as smaller gatherings for people who are involved with creating better cities for people. They arrange workshops and masterclasses, they sell books and continue research in city life and public spaces. They also work as consultants in different projects all over the world.

Create {{a process that}} builds community, business, political and media consensus even during a disruptive construction program. Mayor Magrath Drive is a key corridor within the City of Lethbridge. Over 30, 000 vehicles per day use the roadway as a commuter route and to access the 150 businesses located along its perimeter. In the late 1990 ’s, traffic volumes exceeded the roadway design capacity. Traffic congestion on Mayor Magrath Drive and services roads, particularly at the intersections, had reduced access to businesses and impacted the efficient movement of vehicles and pedestrians along the corridor.

40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that the {{television}} industry in Britain has entered a period of fundamental and unpredictable change. Historical patterns of media consumption are changing and new markets are developing for a variety of entertainment and information experiences. Many of these changes are driven by technological advancements and changing consumer lifestyles. Corporate structures, strategic networks and competitor-collaborator relationships are increasingly characterised by their complexity. Traditional models of revenue generation are under pressure, and there are uncertainties about what will replace them. The present climate of economic instability accompanied by recent, unexpected jolts to the financial markets holds, as yet, indeterminate repercussions over the longer term for investment in the media. On the policy front, the tension between the challenges of an expanding market and the obligations of public service broadcasting suggest the need for an evolving regulatory framework. New contradictions are emerging such as those of globalism and the appeal of localism or even individualism. Paradoxically, forces for convergence appear to be shaping industry dynamics at the same time as pressures for diversity are reinforcing social and cultural differences. All of these have implications for how the television industry will develop over the next ten years. For policy makers, industry regulators and corporate planners operating in this volatile environment, the usual tools for forecasting and strategic decision making are often less than effective. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>plan</b> for a future that is shifting, turbulent and characterised by uncertainty? Traditional techniques for planning and modelling require at least a modicum of predictability and stability. From July 2001 to June 2002, twenty-seven key industry professionals came together to consider these issues with a view to developing ideas about how the television industry might prepare for and respond to the challenges of the next ten years. This report is an outcome of their discussions held over the twelve month period. The project, called Future Reflections, was initiated and facilitated by the Media School at Bournemouth University with research support from the Independent Television Commission and the British Screen Advisory Council. The aims of the Future Reflections project were to: • develop a set of scenarios about the future of television, collaboratively with industry experts • help the television sector define and deal with common future issues • contribute to public policy and debate concerning the long-term future of television • contribute to the advancement of a theoretical framework for the scenario analysis approach. The primary question addressed by the Future Reflections project was: What is the television industry likely to look like in 2012 and what will be the implications for public policy and the management of companies involved in television? This report, together with a seminar on 21 November 2002, is a final stage in the project, although it is intended to publish a number of articles in academic journals at a later date. The report presents a set of four possible scenarios for television in 2012 together with the issues and challenges associated with each of the scenarios...|$|E

[...] Classroom management [...] Assessment [...] Lesson planning. Introduction. So, you've {{decided to go to}} China to teach English as a second language. Or, you are in China now beginning the adventure of a lifetime. Congratulations!By now, you probably have encountered the attitude that says, "You speak English; what more do you need to know?" Just {{the fact that you are}} a native English speaker makes you an expert in your subject matter. And since your students will have been studying English with non-native English speakers for 9 - 12 years already, their biggest need/lack will have been (or will be perceived to have been) exposure to native speakers. Every word you speak is an educational event! What more might you need to know?This manual is designed to help you when all of the other things you might possibly need to know become painfully apparent. What exactly is ESL? What is a good teacher [...] . a good class… a successful lesson? How do you teach American English Conversation to a class of 50, using a British English grammar text that is 10 years out of date? How do you do ANYTHING without a computer/copy machine/overhead projector? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>plan</b> a lesson when you've never stood up in front of a class before? How do you even know where to start?Chapter 1 will cover the history of English and English education in China. This should give you a good overview of the topic and help you to understand your place as a foreign teacher of English in China. Chapter 2 will cover a number of topics specifically dealing with the theoretical underpinnings of Teaching ESL. It will discuss methods, concepts, issues, and some of the current debates in the field of Teaching English as a Second Language (TESL). Chapter 3 will discuss several factors that may affect your students' learning. While this section cannot hope to cover all possible influences (that is beyond the scope of this thesis), a number of the major issues are addressed. Chapter 4 begins to move out of the realm of "theory" and into the nuts and bolts of actually teaching English in China. What can you expect (and what might be expected of you) if you are assigned to teach Extensive or Intensive Reading, Writing, Grammar, Vocabulary, or Oral English?Chapter 5 offers some suggestions on organizing and managing your class time and accomplishing the myriad of daily tasks involved in teaching. Chapter 6 suggests ways you might create tests that will enable you to assess your students' needs prior to planning lessons. Chapter 7 is the longest single chapter in the manual, covering lesson planning from the semester down to the individual class level. A sample of a lesson plan is presented, as well as an explanation of how it was created. All handouts and notes required to use it in an actual class are included. Department of EnglishThesis (M.
