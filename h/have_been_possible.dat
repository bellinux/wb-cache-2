5|$|A German {{victory on}} the Battle of Britain Day was unlikely. It could only <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> if Park had made crass errors {{and had been}} caught on the ground. Stephen Bungay postulates that had the loss rates been reversed, Dowding could have {{replaced}} those with reinforcements from his C units and carried on. Moreover, during both major engagements Fighter Command had used less than ½ of its strength. It {{would have been able}} to meet the Luftwaffe again on the morrow.|$|E
5|$|Rieve and his {{executive}} officer were both severely criticized {{for failing to}} take all possible steps to save Karlsruhe in a later investigation into the sinking. The report concluded that since the ship was still afloat after two hours, and two torpedoes were required to sink her, it might <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> to take her under tow back to Kristiansand or another port. In addition, the forward pumps still had power, and so the flooding could have been slowed enough to permit {{a return to a}} safe harbor.|$|E

5|$|The TDRS-1 {{program was}} overall less successful, with the {{satellite}} suffering several computer failures and an overall loss of telemetry for several hours. In all, the orbiter {{was able to}} use the satellite for 65 of the planned 89 orbits, and could make successful use of the connection on about forty. The Continuous Flow Electrophoresis System equipment functioned as planned, processing several hundred times more material than would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> on Earth, and the Asahi Shimbun crystal experiment, flown for the second time, was able to produce snow crystals after the canister was redesigned.|$|E
5|$|The {{appearance}} of the Space Exploration Center's Inquiry Room was influenced by Sylvia Anderson, who {{in her role as}} producer supervised design aspects and wanted the light-blue uniforms of the SEC officials to be vividly contrasted with a tangerine and black duotone backdrop.

5|$|The stegosaurians {{were widely}} {{distributed}} geographically {{in the late}} Jurassic.

5|$|Two {{species of}} {{woodpeckers}} in the Americas, the ivory-billed woodpecker and the imperial woodpecker, {{have been considered}} extinct since the mid-to-late 20th century, though there <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> but disputed sightings of ivory-billed woodpeckers in the United States since 2004, and a small population may survive in Cuba. Another critically endangered species is the Okinawa woodpecker from Japan, with a single declining population {{of a few hundred}} birds. It is threatened by deforestation, golf course, dam and helipad construction, road building and agricultural development.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the release}} of Ace, Cascade Games was infamous for their Cassette 50 (1983) game {{compilation}} that featured simplistic and subpar games. Stevens points out that without the income from the compilation, the project would not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible.</b> The developers estimate the production cost of Ace at £40k. Following {{the release of}} Ace, Cascade moved into mainstream AAA game development. Wilhelmy says that Cascade boasted over a million GBP in turnover over the following years. The company produced two sequels, Ace 2 (1987) and ACE 2088 (1989), and various other games before closing down in 1990.|$|E

5|$|If Sedna {{formed in}} its current location, the Sun's {{original}} protoplanetary disc must have extended as far as 75AU into space. Also, Sedna's initial orbit must have been approximately circular, otherwise its formation by the accretion of smaller bodies into a whole would not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible,</b> because the large relative velocities between planetesimals {{would have been too}} disruptive. Therefore, it must have been tugged into its current eccentric orbit by a gravitational interaction with another body. In their initial paper, Brown, Rabinowitz and colleagues suggested three possible candidates for the perturbing body: an unseen planet beyond the Kuiper belt, a single passing star, or one of the young stars embedded with the Sun in the stellar cluster in which it formed.|$|E

5|$|Meråker saw in {{industrial}} boom {{due to the}} railway. There was already a copper mine and smelters at Kopperå, and they saw the railway as a possibility to change from locally produced charcoal to imported coke. A pulp mill opened in 1887, but burned down in 1912. The most important industry was the carbide factory that opened in Kopperå in 1900—Meraker Smelteverk. Though located close to the hydroelectricity sources in Meråker, the import and export of raw and finished materials would not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> without the railway. A port for the plant was built at Muruvik in 1918.|$|E
5|$|One {{week later}} the FIA {{announced}} a review panel {{to investigate the}} cause of the accident, which was made up of former drivers and team principals, and published its findings four weeks later. The report found that there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident. Instead, the contributing factors were found to include track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the circuit. The report also made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering stricken vehicles — which were subsequently introduced for the 2015 season — before concluding that it would not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> to mitigate Bianchi's injuries through changes to the cockpit design. The report also revealed that the fail-safe for the car's brake-by-wire system had failed. Despite this, Marussia was not found to be responsible for the accident.|$|E
5|$|The 1910 general {{elections}} {{had left the}} Liberals as a minority government dependent upon the support of Irish Nationalists. As desired by the Nationalists, Asquith introduced legislation that would give Ireland Home Rule, but the Conservatives and Unionists opposed it. As tempers rose over the Home Rule Bill, which would never <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> without the Parliament Act, relations between the elderly Knollys and the Conservatives became poor, and he was pushed into retirement. Desperate to avoid the prospect of civil war in Ireland between Unionists and Nationalists, George called a meeting of all parties at Buckingham Palace in July 1914 {{in an attempt to}} negotiate a settlement. After four days the conference ended without an agreement. Political developments in Britain and Ireland were overtaken by events in Europe, and the issue of Irish Home Rule was shelved.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{members of}} Ursidae {{belong to the}} extinct subfamily Amphicynodontinae, including Parictis (late Eocene to early middle Miocene, 38–18 Mya) and the slightly younger Allocyon (early Oligocene, 34–30 Mya), both from North America. These animals looked very different from today's bears, being small and raccoon-like in overall appearance, and diets perhaps more {{similar to that of}} a badger. Parictis does not appear in Eurasia and Africa until the Miocene. It is unclear whether late-Eocene ursids were also present in Eurasia, although faunal exchange across the Bering land bridge may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> during a major sea level low stand as early as the late Eocene (about 37 Mya) and continuing into the early Oligocene. European genera morphologically are very similar to Allocyon, and to the much younger American Kolponomos (about 18 Mya), are known from the Oligocene, including Amphicticeps and Amphicynodon.|$|E

5|$|BioWare {{provided}} its Aurora Engine from Neverwinter Nights for the sequel. One of {{the decisions}} to use Aurora rather than build a new engine from scratch was the toolset—Obsidian wanted players {{to continue to be}} able to make content for the game, which may not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>possible</b> with a new engine. BioWare made itself available to Obsidian with technical support on the engine, but Obsidian planned on completely overhauling Aurora, including its code. The designers wanted to improve the visuals of the first game with additions such as better lighting and textures, which required significant changes to the engine. The upgraded engine was referred to as Electron. Electron was designed to incorporate DirectX to make it compatible for a potential Xbox 360 release, but Obsidian eventually abandoned plans for a port to the system for financial reasons. The toolset that was used to create the game was also revamped, and included several additions like a customizable interface, a new dialogue format, and building assistants—similar to the wizards found in Microsoft Word and Excel. Like Neverwinter Nights, the toolset was included in the game's release for players to use.|$|E
