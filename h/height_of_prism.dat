5|$|The {{work of the}} {{surveying}} {{team was}} greatly hampered by the inclemency of the weather, and it took until 1776 to complete the task. To find {{the volume of the}} mountain, it was necessary to divide it into a set <b>of</b> vertical <b>prisms</b> and compute the volume of each. The triangulation task falling to Charles Hutton was considerable: the surveyors had obtained thousands of bearings to more than a thousand points around the mountain. Moreover, the vertices <b>of</b> his <b>prisms</b> did not always conveniently coincide with the surveyed heights. To make sense of all his data, he hit upon the idea of interpolating a series of lines at set intervals between his measure values, marking points <b>of</b> equal <b>height.</b> In doing so, not only could he easily determine the <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> his <b>prisms,</b> but from the swirl of the lines one could get an instant impression of the form of the terrain. Hutton had invented contour lines, in common use since for depicting cartographic relief.|$|R

The base <b>of</b> the <b>prism</b> is represented as an n-side polygon (e. g., triangle, square, pentagon, etc.) which depicts the internal information of the system, whereas the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>prism</b> is represented as a single axis which depicts the external information of the system.

40|$|Trace of ray {{deviated}} by a prism, {{which is}} common in a TIR (total internal reflection) measurement system, is sometimes difficult to manage, especially if the prism is an equilateral right angle prism (ERAP). The point where the ray is reflected inside the right-angle prism is also changed as the angle of incident ray changed. In an ATR (attenuated total reflectance) measurement system, range of this point determines size of sample. Using JavaScript and HTML 5 model and visualization of ray tracing deviated by an ERAP is perform and reported in this work. Some data are obtained from this visualization and an empirical relations between angle of incident ray source θ_S, angle of ray detector hand θ_D, and angle of ray detector θ'_D are presented for radial position of ray source R_S, radial position of ray detector R_D, <b>height</b> <b>of</b> right-angle <b>prism</b> t, and refractive index <b>of</b> the <b>prism</b> n.

40|$|The author {{measured}} the stress generated in situ by a tamper (78 kg) while compacting cohesive soil (Cr.) and sand (Fr.) of a fill-type darn, and discussed these theoretical background. Results are as follow. 1) The {{model of the}} behavior of tamper-ground systems are expressed by the linear models of 3 rd, 2 nd and single degree of freedom as eq. (1) -(4), eq. (12) -(13) and eq. (17), shown Fig. 1. 2) By supposing a soil prism region where the stress works effective for compaction, the stress are calculated from the theory of the strain energy. The <b>height</b> <b>of</b> soil <b>prism</b> is double <b>of</b> the depth generating the stress which is one half of the surface stress. A is a contact area in eq.

However using equations in 2), theoretical stresses are calculated at 3. 8 - 5. 2 kg/cm 2 which almost coincide with experimental results. 5) Ground characteristics such as of soil, water content and density effect the stress generated by a tamper...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a CFD {{commercial}} code {{is used to}} evaluate the pressure drop through pipes in a stream of high pressure gas. Both hexahedral and tetrahedral grids are considered. Preliminarily, a grid sensitivity analysis is carried out by comparing CFD results with analytical results. Each grid is characterized by a different number and thickness of layers in order to investigate the behavior of the grid with respect to the boundary layer. Then, the model is validated by using a literature test case, in which high pressure gas flow through a rough pipe is experimentally studied. Moreover, various equations of state (i. e. constant properties, ideal gas and Redlich-Kwong equation) and boundary conditions (e. g. pressure, mass flow, etc.) are taken into consideration and compared. Finally, the model is used to extrapolate the behavior of gaseous fuels (i. e. natural gas, biogas and hydrogen-methane mixture) flowing at high pressure through pipes of different roughness. The analyses show that the radial depth <b>of</b> the <b>prism</b> layers on pipe wall has to be controlled to allow the correct resolution of the boundary layer. Moreover, the results highlight that the first element <b>height</b> <b>of</b> the <b>prism</b> layer should be high enough to avoid inconsistencies in the rough model application. At the same time, the grid used for calculations does not strongly influence the numerical results and hence tune of the first element height to perfectly fit the roughness is not always justified. The final analysis on the different gaseous fuels put into evidence the capability of the CFD analysis to determine the energy performance of fuel transportation in gas pipeline...|$|R
40|$|Out-of-home {{activities}} are engaged within time - space prisms, but the prisms themselves are unobservable. In this paper, stochastic frontier models with observed departure and arrival times as dependent variables are formulated to locate time - space prism vertices. Two possible distributions {{often used in}} frontier models for one-sided disturbance terms, the half-normal distribution and exponential distribution, are examined better to represent observed behavior. The locations <b>of</b> morning <b>prism</b> origin vertices and evening prism terminal vertices on working days and nonworking days are estimated with an empirical dataset obtained in southeast Florida. The {{results suggest that the}} exponential distribution has a better goodness of fit, but the coefficient estimates of explanatory variables are similar between models with the two distributions, suggesting that the model parameter estimates are robust regardless of the assumptions regarding the distribution of the one-sided random disturbance. It is found that the average <b>heights</b> <b>of</b> the morning <b>prism</b> before work and the evening prism after work on working days are estimated at about 2. 5 hours and about 3 hours, respectively. It is also found that part-time workers have prism heights that are on average larger by half an hour than those of full-time workers on working days, and smaller by 1. 5 hours on nonworking days. ...|$|R
40|$|Organic {{components}} of typical prismatic layers in several molluscan shells were reexamined by applying {{scanning electron microscopy}} to preparations treated with the freeze-dry or the critical-point-dry method, with the result showing the following: The interior <b>of</b> <b>prisms</b> is almost filled up with a spongy intraprismatic matrix. Also three principal types <b>of</b> <b>prisms</b> are distinguishable {{according to the state}} of development and the histochemical nature of a vertical (interprismatic) wall. Namely, <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> type 1 are separated from their neighbor by a rigid vertical wall, and are represented by calcite simple <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> Pinctada and aragonite simple <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> Anodonta: <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> type 2 are separated by a compound (partly rigid and partly spongy) vertical wall, and are represented by aragonite simple <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> Unio; <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> type 3 are separated by a spongy vertical wall, and are represented by composite <b>prisms</b> <b>of</b> Tapes and Peronidia. These findings suggest that type 2 is intermediate between types 1 and 3, and that transformation of an interprismatic matrix from a "primitive" rigid matrix to a more "advanced" spongy one has probably taken place in the course <b>of</b> evolution <b>of</b> <b>prisms.</b> In addition, the histochemical nature of the rigid matrix is acidophilic like the shell epidermis. Meanwhile, the spongy matrix, regardless of being inter- or intraprismatic, is basophilic, and will have some connections with mineralization <b>of</b> <b>prisms...</b>|$|R

The neural mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> adaptation {{have come}} under scrutiny since the observations that the technique can alleviate hemispatial neglect following stroke, and can alter spatial cognition in healthy controls. Relative to non-imaging behavioral studies, fMRI investigations <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> adaptation face several challenges arising from the confined physical environment of the scanner and the supine position of the participants. Any researcher who wishes to administer prism adaptation in an fMRI environment must adjust their procedures enough to enable the experiment to be performed, {{but not so much}} that the behavioral task departs too much from true prism adaptation. Furthermore, the specific temporal dynamics of behavioral components <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> adaptation present additional challenges for measuring their neural correlates. We developed a system for measuring the key features <b>of</b> <b>prism</b> adaptation behavior within an fMRI environment. To validate our configuration, we present behavioral (pointing) and head movement data from 11 right-hemisphere lesioned patients and 17 older controls who underwent sham and real prism adaptation in an MRI scanner. Most participants could adapt to prismatic displacement with minimal head movements, and the procedure was well tolerated.
