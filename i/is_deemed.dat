5|$|For the 2010 Ski Flying World Cup season, {{beginning}} in Oberstdorf, and from thereon used at all ski flying and ski jumping events, a supplementary points system was introduced. This system {{takes into account}} the wind speed and direction during each jump, as well as mid-round start gate adjustments, in order to enable a more fair contest. If a headwind is present, this <b>is</b> <b>deemed</b> an unfair advantage and points are therefore deducted as 'compensation'; if a tailwind is present, this <b>is</b> <b>deemed</b> to be a disadvantage and additional points are awarded instead. The amount of deduction or addition is calculated via coefficient using complex instrumentation which analyses the wind conditions at the time of a jump, and the value of the points themselves are in minimum increments of 0.1.|$|E

5|$|When Article 5A {{is brought}} into force, the President will {{also be able to}} decline to assent to a bill seeking to amend the Constitution that has a direct or {{indirect}} effect of circumventing or curtailing his discretionary powers.

If the Tribunal rules that the bill does not have this effect, the President <b>is</b> <b>deemed</b> to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the Tribunal pronounces its opinion in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal decides to the contrary, the Prime Minister may opt to submit the bill to the electorate. If the bill is supported at a national referendum by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast, the President <b>is</b> <b>deemed</b> to have assented to the bill on the day immediately following the day when the results of the referendum have been published in the Government Gazette.|$|E

States maintain a BAC level between 0.08 and 0.10 percent for non-CMV drivers.

5|$|As regards a bill {{mentioned}} in paragraph 1, the President, acting {{in accordance with}} the advice of the Cabinet, may refer to a Constitutional Tribunal {{the question of whether the}} bill circumvents or curtails the discretionary powers conferred on him or her by the Constitution. If the Tribunal is of the opinion that the bill does not have this effect, the President <b>is</b> <b>deemed</b> to have assented to the bill on the day after the day when the Tribunal's opinion is pronounced in open court. On the other hand, if the Tribunal feels that the bill does have the circumventing or curtailing effect, and the President either has withheld or withholds his assent to the bill, the Prime Minister may direct that the bill be submitted to the electors for a national referendum. In that case, the bill only becomes law if it is supported by not less than two-thirds of the total number of votes cast at the referendum. If 30 days have expired after a bill has been presented to the President for assent and he or she has neither signified the withholding of assent nor referred the Bill to a Constitutional Tribunal, the bill <b>is</b> <b>deemed</b> to have been assented to on the day following the expiry of the 30-day period. The procedure is similar for a bill {{mentioned in}} paragraph 2, except that if the Constitutional Tribunal rules that the bill has a circumventing or curtailing effect, the Prime Minister has no power to put the bill to a referendum. This ensures that changes to the President's discretionary powers can only be made by way of constitutional amendments and not ordinary statutes.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to pursue quality standards for computer-manufacturing of prosthetic sockets for people with transtibial limb loss. Thirty-three duplicates of study participants’ normally used sockets were fabricated using central fabrication facilities. Socket-manufacturing errors were compared with clinical assessments of socket fit. Of the 33 sockets tested, 23 <b>were</b> <b>deemed</b> clinically to need modification. All 13 sockets with mean radial error (MRE) greater than 0. 25 mm were clinically unacceptable, and 11 of those <b>were</b> <b>deemed</b> in need of sizing reduction. Of the remaining 20 sockets, 5 sockets with interquartile range (IQR) greater than 0. 40 mm <b>were</b> <b>deemed</b> globally or regionally oversized and in need of modification. Of the remaining 15 sockets, 5 sockets with closed contours of elevated surface normal angle error (SNAE) <b>were</b> <b>deemed</b> clinically to need shape modification at those closed contour locations. The remaining 10 sockets <b>were</b> <b>deemed</b> clinically acceptable and not in need modification. MRE, IQR, and SNAE may serve as effective metrics to characterize quality of computer-manufactured prosthetic sockets, helping facilitate the development of quality standards for the socket manufacturing industry...|$|R
