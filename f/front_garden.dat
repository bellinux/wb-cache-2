5|$|Moore and Nash {{were on the}} organising {{committee}} of the International Surrealist Exhibition, {{which took place in}} London in 1936. In 1937, Roland Penrose purchased an abstract 'Mother and Child' in stone from Moore that he displayed in the <b>front</b> <b>garden</b> of his house in Hampstead. The work proved controversial with other residents and the local press ran a campaign against the piece over the next two years. At this time Moore gradually transitioned from direct carving to casting in bronze, modelling preliminary maquettes in clay or plaster rather than making preparatory drawings.|$|E
5|$|The {{statue of}} James II is an outdoor bronze {{sculpture}} {{located in the}} <b>front</b> <b>garden</b> of the National Gallery at Trafalgar Square in London, United Kingdom. Probably inspired by French statues of the same period, it depicts James II of England as a Roman emperor, wearing Roman armour and a laurel wreath (traditionally awarded to a victorious Roman commander). It originally also depicted him holding a baton. It was produced by the workshop of Grinling Gibbons, though probably not by Gibbons himself. The statue has been relocated several times since it was first erected in {{the grounds of the}} old Palace of Whitehall in 1686, only two years before James II was deposed.|$|E
5|$|In 1955, the McCartney {{family moved}} {{for the last}} time to a small three-bedroomed brick-built terrace house at 20 Forthlin Road in Allerton, which is now owned by The National Trust. It only cost £1:6s:0d per week, which was due to Mary's {{seniority}} at the hospital. Before moving to Forthlin Road, Jim had been secretary of the Speke Horticultural Society, and had often sent his sons out to canvass for new members. Jim planted dahlias and snapdragons in the <b>front</b> <b>garden</b> of Forthlin Road and regularly trimmed the lavender hedge, although it was Paul's job to collect horse manure from the local streets in a bucket to be dug into the flowerbeds. As Jim was a heavy smoker, Jim would first dry and then crush sprigs of Lavender and then burn them (like incense) in the ashtrays to kill the smell of his cigarette smoke.|$|E

5|$|Moderate winds blew {{down about}} 1,600trees in the district, 23 of which fell onto houses. The United States National Arboretum lost many mature trees and azaleas {{on the bank}} of the Anacostia River. The winds also downed many power lines, leaving 129,000customers without power. Many streets were blocked by the fallen trees and power lines. At the White House, the winds downed one tree in the <b>front</b> <b>garden,</b> though there was no damage to the {{building}} itself. The storm surge resulted in flooding at the Washington Navy Yard. There, the marina was damaged, and some buildings and cars in low area garages were flooded. Five people were rescued from cars in flood waters during the storm, and several roads were closed due to the flooding. Throughout the district, the passage of Isabel created approximately 30,000pounds (13,600kg) of debris. Damage in Washington, D.C., totaled $125million (2003USD, ($ USD).|$|E
5|$|Will, Neil and Jay's girlfriends {{have all}} {{broken up with}} them since {{the events of the}} last film, and Simon is unhappy with his girlfriend Lucy, who has become obsessive and abusive. Simon and Will are {{depressed}} and ostracised at university; Neil is working in a bank; and Jay is taking a gap year in Australia. He emails Neil, claiming that he is now a top DJ at a popular night club, lives in a luxury mansion, and has daily sex with multiple partners. This convinces them to visit him in Australia for their Easter holidays. Once they arrive at the club they find that Jay in fact only works as a toilet attendant and lives in a tent in his Uncle's <b>front</b> <b>garden,</b> while Will meets Katie, an old friend from his private school days, who is backpacking, and she persuades him to join her.|$|E

25|$|The {{hall was}} covered in render during the 18th century. An {{engraving}} published in James Hall's History of 1883 shows the rendered front façade with hexagonal, octagonal, rectangular and diamond-shaped window lights, two 18th-century doorcases, several tall brick chimneys and an altered roofline. In photographs from around 1900 to the 1950s, the hall has a pebble-dashed appearance and retains the old windows, doorcases and chimneys; a <b>front</b> <b>garden</b> enclosed by low iron railings is also present. The railings had been removed by 1948, presumably during the Second World War. The hall was listed on 19 April 1948, {{and was one of}} the first group of buildings in Nantwich to attain this status. During the 1940s and 1950s the hall deteriorated, and by 1958 it was in a dilapidated condition. Local architect James Edleston restored the building in the 1960s. The majority of the render was removed, as well as most of the old windows, one of the Georgian doorcases and several chimneys. The <b>front</b> <b>garden</b> also disappeared at this time.|$|E

Some of the garden are visible to the public from the street while the back garden is more private but over time became overshadowed by modern housing developments.

25|$|George Hodson {{fell to the}} ground. He {{had been}} struck by a single bullet, {{travelling}} from front to back. The bullet had exited through Hodson's back, about an inch lower than the point of entry in his right chest. Hodson died {{in the middle of}} Sydney Road. Paterson, now with a rifle, ran back outside and onto Champ Street. He decided he could not get a clear shot, so he stood on a low wall in the prison's <b>front</b> <b>garden.</b> He aimed his rifle at Ryan, and claimed he fired a shot in the air when a woman came into his line of sight.|$|E
25|$|Purcell and Elmslie set {{the house}} thirty feet {{behind the front}} {{property}} line, conserving a sense of privacy for its inhabitants and allowing them to look over their neighbors’ gardens to their north and south, rather than through their windows. Likewise, the Purcells and the neighbors could enjoy the home’s <b>front</b> <b>garden,</b> created in collaboration with landscape architect Harry Franklin Baker, including a reflecting pool with water plants and small fountain, and native plants and trees.

25|$|Also {{included}} is {{an example}} of tunnel back to backs which were built in large numbers in Bowling after the 1866 bylaw change. The tunnel gave access to the rear two houses and a group of four privies. Most such houses exceeded the bylaw minimum (the 1870 bylaw still permitted construction of the one up and one down) by including a side scullery and often a small <b>front</b> <b>garden.</b> In the example in the table the ground floor had a good size living room and a side scullery with access to the tunnel. Such houses had either two or three bedrooms, the third being in a flying free hold over the tunnel. Even the three-bedroom type was considerably smaller than the type 3 Ripley Ville house.|$|E
25|$|Simpson's initial {{claim that}} he was asleep {{at the time of}} the murders was refuted by several {{different}} accounts. According to defense lawyer Johnnie Cochran, Simpson had never left his house that night, and he was alone as he packed his belongings to travel to Chicago. Cochran claimed that Simpson went outside through the back door to hit a few golf balls into the children's sandbox in the <b>front</b> <b>garden,</b> one or more of which made the three loud thumps on the wall of Kaelin's bungalow. Cochran produced a potential alibi witness, Rosa Lopez, a neighbor's Spanish-speaking housekeeper who testified that she had seen Simpson's car parked outside his house {{at the time of the}} murders. But Lopez's testimony, which was not presented to the jury, was pulled apart under intense cross-examination by Clark, when Lopez was forced to admit that she could not be sure of the precise time she saw Simpson's white Bronco outside his house.|$|E
25|$|Located in {{the city}} of Oakland, California, at 4770 Lincoln Ave, it is the only LDS temple built with a modern five-spire design and {{exhibits}} an Oriental motif. Its architect was Harold W. Burton. The exterior of the temple is reinforced concrete faced with sierra white granite from Raymond, California. On the north and south faces of the temple are two decorative friezes; it is the last LDS temple to have such. The back (south side) is a depiction of Christ descending from heaven {{to the people of the}} American continent soon after his resurrection in the Holy Land. The front (north side) illustrates Christ preaching his gospel to the people. Within the <b>front</b> <b>garden</b> courtyard there is a statue of children in front of a bronze plaque bearing a scripture from 3 Nephi chapter 17, from the Book of Mormon, relating how Christ blessed the children during his visit to the people of ancient America.|$|E
50|$|The IBZ Berlin's {{garden was}} {{designed}} by Peter Latz, and consists of three main areas: the <b>front</b> <b>gardens,</b> the backyard garden and the roof <b>garden.</b> The <b>front</b> <b>gardens</b> reference the historical appearance of the Rüdesheimer Square. The same applies for the roadside trellis, which was however removed in the early 21st century and, according to the management, shall be rebuilt in a modified way with Erich Wiesner. The side entrances of the house are characterised by pairs of trees. The courtyard garden can be distinguished by the cobbled paths that run parallel and have, in part, been reshaped.|$|R

500|$|The River Mersey forms Didsbury's {{southern}} and southwestern boundaries and certain {{stretches of the}} river also demarcate {{the boundaries of the}} City of Manchester.
