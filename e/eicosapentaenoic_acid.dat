5|$|Most {{of the fat}} {{found in}} food {{is in the form}} of triglycerides, cholesterol, and phospholipids. Some dietary fat is {{necessary}} to facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins (A, D, E, and K) and carotenoids. Humans and other mammals have a dietary requirement for certain essential fatty acids, such as linoleic acid (an omega-6 fatty acid) and alpha-linolenic acid (an omega-3 fatty acid) because they cannot be synthesized from simple precursors in the diet. Both of these fatty acids are 18-carbon polyunsaturated fatty acids differing in the number and position of the double bonds. Most vegetable oils are rich in linoleic acid (safflower, sunflower, and corn oils). Alpha-linolenic acid is found in the green leaves of plants, and in selected seeds, nuts, and legumes (in particular flax, rapeseed, walnut, and soy). Fish oils are particularly rich in the longer-chain omega-3 fatty acids <b>eicosapentaenoic</b> <b>acid</b> (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). A large number of studies have shown positive health benefits associated with consumption of omega-3 fatty acids on infant development, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and various mental illnesses, such as depression, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, and dementia. In contrast, it is now well-established that consumption of trans fats, such as those present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils, are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackground & aimsSeveral {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that vegetarians and vegans have much lower plasma concentrations of omega- 3 fatty acids (i. e., docosahexaenoic and <b>eicosapentaenoic</b> <b>acids)</b> when compared to those who eat fish. The purposes of this study were 1) to define the age and/or sex-specific docosahexaenoic plus <b>eicosapentaenoic</b> <b>acids</b> levels in red blood cell membranes (expressed as a percent of total fatty acids; hereafter the omega- 3 index) in long-term vegans, and 2) {{to determine the effects of}} a vegetarian omega- 3 supplement (254  mg docosahexaenoic plus eicosapentaenoic acids/day for 4 months) on the omega- 3 index. MethodsA sample (n =  165) of vegans was recruited, and their omega- 3 index was determined using a dried blood spot methodology. A subset of 46 subjects with a baseline omega- 3 index of < 4 % was given a vegetarian omega- 3 supplement for 4 months and then retested. ResultsThe mean ± SD omega- 3 index was 3. 7  ±  1. 0 % which was similar to that of a cohort of omnivores (deployed US soldiers) from a recently-reported study. Among the vegan cohort, the index was significantly higher in females than males (3. 9  ±  1. 0 % vs. 3. 5  ±  1. 0 %; p =  0. 026) and was directly related to age (p for trend =  0. 009). The omega- 3 index increased from 3. 1  ±  0. 6 % to 4. 8  ±  0. 8 % (p =  0. 009) in the supplementation study. ConclusionsWe conclude that vegans have low baseline omega- 3 levels, but not lower than omnivores who also consume very little docosahexaenoic and <b>eicosapentaenoic</b> <b>acids.</b> The vegans responded robustly to a relatively low dose of a vegetarian omega- 3 supplement...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the fatty acid {{composition}} of human fertilization-failed oocytes. A total of 150 unfertilized oocytes from 43 women undergoing in-vitro fertilization (IVF) were analysed using capillary gas chromatography.

Of the monounsaturated fatty acids (14. 27 %) oleic acid was the most abundant (9. 77 %). Polyunsaturated fatty acids comprised 6. 50 % of fatty acids, the n- 6 :n- 3 ratio being 7. 73.

OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to assess the association between plasma phospholipid fatty acids and risk of total prostate cancer by stage and grade. DESIGN: This was a nested case-control analysis of 962 men with a diagnosis of prostate cancer after a median follow-up time of 4. 2 y and 1061 matched controls who were {{taking part in the}} European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition. The fatty acid composition of plasma phospholipids was measured by gas chromatography, and the risk of prostate cancer was estimated by using conditional logistic regression with adjustment for lifestyle variables. RESULTS: We found a positive association between palmitic acid and risk of total, localized, and low-grade prostate cancer. The risk of prostate cancer for men in the highest quintile compared with the lowest quintile of palmitic acid was 1. 47 (95 % CI: 0. 97, 2. 23; P for trend = 0. 032).

Plant foods can provide alpha-linolenic acid which the human body uses to synthesize the long-chain n-3 fatty acids EPA and DHA.

25|$|There are {{multiple}} subfamilies of eicosanoids, including most prominently the prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, lipoxins, resolvins, and eoxins but also others {{as noted in}} the following Nomenclature section. For each subfamily, there is the potential to have at least 5 separate series of metabolites, two series derived from ω-6 PUFAs (arachidonic and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acids), one series derived from the ω-3 PUFA (<b>eicosapentaenoic</b> <b>acid),</b> and one series derived from the ω-9 PUFA (mead acid). This subfamily distinction is important. Mammals, including humans, are unable to convert ω-6 into ω-3 PUFA. In consequence, tissue levels of the ω-6 and ω-3 PUFAs and their corresponding eicosanoid metabolites link directly to the amount of dietary ω-6 versus ω-3 PUFAs consumed. Since certain of the ω-6 and ω-3 PUFA series of metabolites have almost diametrically opposing physiological and pathological activities, it has often been suggested that the deleterious consequences associated with the consumption of ω-6 PUFA-rich diets reflects excessive production and activities of ω-6 PUFA-derived eicosanoids while the beneficial effects associated with the consumption of ω-3 PUFA-rich diets reflect the excessive production and activities of ω-3 PUFA-derived eicosanoids. In this view, the opposing effects of ω-6 PUFA-derived and ω-3 PUFA-derived eicosanoids on key target cells underlie the detrimental and beneficial effects of ω-6 and ω-3 PUFA-rich diets on inflammation and allergy reactions, atherosclerosis, hypertension, cancer growth, {{and a host of other}} processes.|$|E

Dietary studies investigating the effects of PUFA-containing oils on lymphocyte functions have yielded contradictory findings; such studies are difficult to compare since there are many variations in protocols. The present study investigated the effects of exogenously added fatty acids on proliferation of leucocytes to whole blood in vitro and the effects of feeding diets containing oils rich in saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids, n- 6 PUFA or n- 3 PUFA on rat leucocyte proliferation in whole blood and on receptor and surface marker expression by peripheral blood leucocytes. When added exogenously to whole blood all fatty acids tested, except myristic acid, inhibited leucocyte proliferation; the greatest inhibition of proliferation was seen with arachidonic and <b>eicosapentaenoic</b> <b>acids.</b> To investigate the effects of dietary lipids on proliferation and surface marker expression by leucocytes, rats were fed for ten weeks on a low fat (LF) diet (approximately 2...|$|R
