40|$|The {{international}} Argo program, {{consisting of}} a global array of more than 3000 <b>free-drifting</b> <b>profiling</b> <b>floats,</b> has now been monitoring the upper 2000 meters of the ocean for several years. One of its main proposed evolutions {{is to be able}} to reach the deeper ocean in order to better observe and understand the key role of the deep ocean in the climate system. For this purpose, Ifremer has designed the new “Deep-Arvor” profiling float: it extends the current operational depth down to 4000 meters, and measures temperature and salinity for up to 150 cycles with CTD pumping continuously and 200 cycles in spot sampling mode. High resolution profiles (up to 2000 points) can be transmitted and data are delivered in near real time according to Argo requirements. Deep-Arvor can be deployed everywhere at sea without any pre-ballasting operation and its light weight (~ 26 kg) makes its launching easy. Its design was done to target a cost effective solution. Predefined spots have been allocated to add an optional oxygen sensor and a connector for an extra sensor. Extensive laboratory tests were successful. The results of the first at sea experiments showed that the expected performances of the operational prototypes had been reached (i. e. to perform up to 150 cycles). Meanwhile, the industrialization phase was completed in order to manufacture the Deep-Arvor float for the pilot experiment in 2015. In this paper, we detail all the steps of the development work and present the results from the at sea experiments...|$|R
40|$|Argo will be {{a global}} array of 3, 000 <b>free-drifting</b> <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> that will measure the {{temperature}} and salinity of the upper 2, 000 metres of the ocean. Global observations from Argo will provide significant benefits for operational oceanography (predictions of ocean conditions {{for use by the}} oceanographic and marine research and industry communities); seasonal forecasting (improved longterm forecasts of wet or dry seasons and better warning of the likelihood of floods and drought) and climate studies (detecting changes in the temperature and salinity of the oceans that are related to climate change). Since its inception about 3 years ago, Argo has gained momentum with 13 nations, plus the European Commission, providing (or planning to provide) funding for floats. Global coverage with around 3, 000 floats is anticipated by 2006. This paper outlines the international Argo project and progress made to date. USE OF NEUTRALLY BUOYANT FLOATS BEFORE ARGO The idea of using neutrally buoyant floats to measure sub-surface ocean currents was first developed in the mid- 1950 s by Stommel (1955) in the US and Swallow (1955) in the UK. These early floats were tracked acoustically and the SOFAR and RAFOS floats that evolved from them were used extensively in the 1970 s and 80 s. A brief history of neutrally buoyant floats is given by Gould (1999). World Ocean Circulation Experiment (WOCE) WOCE is a component of the World Climate Research Program (WCRP) and involved scientists in 30 countries in carrying out observations of the worlds oceans and developing global ocean models to assimilate these data. The measurement phase of WOCE lasted from 1990 to 1998 and required global coverage with sub-surface floats, along with other measurements. This precluded acoustic tracking and resulted in the development by Webb Research Corporation of the first-generation Autonomous Lagrangian Circulation Explorer (ALACE), Davis et al. (1992), and <b>Profiling</b> ALACE (PALACE) <b>floats,</b> Davis et al...|$|R

In parallel with their emergence, {{the field of}} miniature, low power bio-optical and biogeochemical sensors is rapidly evolving. Over recent years, the bio-geochemical and bio-optical community has begun {{to benefit from the}} increase in observational capacities by developing <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> that allow the measurement of key biooptical variables and subsequent products of biogeochemical and ecosystem relevance like Chlorophyll a (Chla), optical backscattering or attenuation coefficients which are proxies of Particulate Organic Carbon (POC), Colored Dissolved Organic Matter (CDOM). Thanks to recent algorithmic improvements, new bio-optical variables such as backscattering coefficient or absorption by CDOM, at present can also be extracted from space observations of ocean color. In the future, an intensification of in situ measurements by bio-optical <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> would permit the elaboration of unique 3 D / 4 D bio-optical climatologies, linking surface (remotely detected) properties to their vertical distribution (measured by autonomous platforms), with which key questions {{in the role of the}} ocean in climate could be addressed. In this context, the objective of the IOCCG (International Ocean Color Coordinating Group) BIO-Argo working group is to elaborate recommendations in view of a future use of bio-optical <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> as part of a network that would include a global array that could be ¿Argo-relevant¿, and specific arrays that would have more focused objectives or regional targets. The overall network, realizing true multi-scale sustained observations of global marine biogeochemistry and biooptics, should satisfy the requirements for validation of ocean color remote sensing as well as the needs of a wider community investigating the impact of global change on biogeochemical cycles and ecosystems. Regarding the global <b>profiling</b> <b>float</b> array, the recommendation is that Chla as well as POC should be the key variables to be systematically measured.

40|$|The {{scientific}} community observes the ocean for {{applications in the}} fields of oceanography and climate research. In order to recover in situ data, more than 3, 000 <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> are operated in the framework of the Argo Program. Each float performs cycles between the sea surface and a depth of 2, 000 meters. Scientific data are gathered while the float is travelling upward from the depths of the oceans, and are then transmitted via a satellite communication system {{at the end of each}} cycle. During its time at the surface, mainly dedicated to transmissions, the float is vulnerable and subject to drift, which limits its use in many studies. Moreover, transmission times are becoming longer due to a trend towards high resolution or multi-sensor profiles. Consequently, the transmission system embedded in the <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> had to evolve. Argos- 3 is the latest generation of the Argos satellite communication system. It has been designed to allow instruments to transmit more data in a small time budget, and as an alternative to Iridium, already implemented on <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> in restrictive applications. This study aims to evaluate the implementation of Argos- 3 on Arvor <b>profiling</b> <b>floats.</b> Tests were carried out first in the laboratory, before being implemented on the Arvor float and deployed at sea.

This method is valid when surface wind speeds are higher than approximately 7  m s− 1 (Soloviev and Lukas 2006; Kawai and Wada 2007).

These float prototypes were equipped with a small-sized and submersible pCO 2 sensor and an optode O 2 sensor for highresolution measurements in the surface ocean layer. Four consecutive deployments were carried out during November 2010 and June 2011 near the Cape Verde Ocean Observatory (CVOO) in the eastern tropical North Atlantic.

To maintain accuracy, regular pCO 2 sensor zeroings at depth and surface, as well as optode measurements in air, were performed for each profile. Through the application of data processing procedures (e. g., time-lag correction), accuracies of floatborne pCO 2 measurements were greatly improved (10 - 15 µatm for the water column and 5 µatm for surface measurements).

40|$|The ARGO {{system is}} {{expected}} to form the backbone of a global ocean observing system. Its extension into the ice-covered polar oceans is difficult, since current <b>profiling</b> <b>float</b> designs {{have to return to}} the sea surface to be located and to transmit their data record. Since 1999 autonomous, <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> were deployed in the Weddell gyre area by the AWI-Bremerhaven, many of which failed when encountering sea-ice. This study presents results from recent float developments aimed to overcome these difficulties through ice-sensing, acoustic positioning, and intermediate data storage. Since 1999 92 autonomous, <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> were deployed in the Weddell gyre area. Since 2002, AWI floats feature an Ice Sensing Algorithm (ISA), which determines the likeliness of ice coverage based on upper ocean temperatures. By the end of 2004, 12 of 18 floats resurfaced after the first winter season. All of those surviving the first winter survived the second winter season as well. Thus, the overall probability of ISA equipped floats to endure the winter season is about 80 % (24 of 30 instruments). A total of 20 floats are equipped with RAFOS receivers. Sound coverage for the RAFOS navigation system is provided by 3 sound sources installed since 2003 (2 refurbished in 2005) and 3 sources installed in 2005. Sound coverage varies according to season, location and sound source manufacturer, though a value of 400 km can be safely assumed for planning purposes.

40|$|Biogeochemical-Argo is the {{extension}} of the Argo array of <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> to include floats that are equipped with biogeochemical sensors for pH, oxygen, nitrate, chlorophyll, suspended particles, and downwelling irradiance. Argo is a highly regarded, international program that measures the changing ocean temperature (heat content) and salinity with <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> distributed throughout the ocean. Newly developed sensors now allow <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> to also observe biogeochemical properties with sufficient accuracy for climate studies. This extension of Argo will enable an observing system that can determine the seasonal to decadal-scale variability in biological productivity, the supply of essential plant nutrients from deep-waters to the sunlit surface layer, ocean acidification, hypoxia, and ocean uptake of CO 2. Biogeochemical-Argo will drive a transformative shift in our ability to observe and predict the effects of climate change on ocean metabolism, carbon uptake, and living marine resource management. Presently, vast areas of the open ocean are sampled only once per decade or less, with sampling occurring mainly in summer. Our ability to detect changes in biogeochemical processes that may occur due to the warming and acidification driven by increasing atmospheric CO 2, as well as by natural climate variability, is greatly hindered by this undersampling. In close synergy with satellite systems (which are effective at detecting global patterns for a few biogeochemical parameters, but only very close to the sea surface {{and in the absence of}} clouds), a global array of biogeochemical sensors would revolutionize our understanding of ocean carbon uptake, productivity, and deoxygenation. The array would reveal the biological, chemical, and physical events that control these processes. Such a system would enable a new generation of global ocean prediction systems in support of carbon cycling, acidification, hypoxia and harmful algal blooms studies, as well as the management of living marine resources. In order to prepare for a global Biogeochemical-Argo array, several prototype <b>profiling</b> <b>float</b> arrays have been developed at the regional scale by various countries and are now operating. Examples include regional arrays in the Southern Ocean (SOCCOM), the North Atlantic Sub-polar Gyre (remOcean), the Mediterranean Sea (NAOS), the Kuroshio region of the North Pacific (INBOX), and the Indian Ocean (IOBioArgo). For example, the SOCCOM program is deploying 200 <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> with biogeochemical sensors throughout the Southern Ocean, including areas covered seasonally with ice. The resulting data, which are publically available in real time, are being linked with computer models to better understand the role of the Southern Ocean in influencing CO 2 uptake, biological productivity, and nutrient supply to distant regions of the world ocean. The success of these regional projects has motivated a planning meeting to discuss the requirements for and applications of a global-scale Biogeochemical-Argo program. The meeting was held 11 - 13 January 2016 in Villefranche-sur-Mer, France with attendees from eight nations now deploying Argo floats with biogeochemical sensors present to discuss this topic. In preparation, computer simulations and a variety of analyses were conducted to assess the resources required for the transition to a global-scale array. Based on these analyses and simulations, it was concluded that an array of about 1000 biogeochemical <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> would provide the needed resolution to greatly improve our understanding of biogeochemical processes and to enable significant improvement in ecosystem models. With an endurance of four years for a Biogeochemical-Argo float, this system would require the procurement and deployment of 250 new floats per year to maintain a 1000 float array. The lifetime cost for a Biogeochemical-Argo float, including capital expense, calibration, data management, and data transmission, is about $ 100, 000. A global Biogeochemical-Argo system would thus cost about $ 25, 000, 000 annually. In the present Argo paradigm, the US provides half of the <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> in the array, while the EU, Austral/Asia, and Canada share most the remaining half. If this approach is adopted, the US cost for the Biogeochemical-Argo system would be ~$ 12, 500, 000 annually and ~$ 6, 250, 000 each for the EU, and Austral/Asia and Canada. This includes no direct costs for ship time and presumes that float deployments can be carried out from future research cruises of opportunity, including, for example, the international GO-SHIP program ([URL] The full-scale implementation of a global Biogeochemical-Argo system with 1000 floats is feasible within a decade.

40|$|The only {{method used}} to date to measure {{dissolved}} nitrate concentration (NITRATE) with sensors mounted on <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> {{is based on}} the absorption of light at ultraviolet wavelengths by nitrate ion (Johnson and Coletti, 2002; Johnson et al., 2010; 2013; D’Ortenzio et al., 2012). Nitrate has a modest UV absorption band with a peak near 210 nm, which overlaps with the stronger absorption band of bromide, which has a peak near 200 nm. In addition, there is a much weaker absorption due to dissolved organic matter and light scattering by particles (Ogura and Hanya, 1966). The UV spectrum thus consists of three components, bromide, nitrate and a background due to organics and particles. The background also includes thermal effects on the instrument and slow drift. All of these latter effects (organics, particles, thermal effects and drift) tend to be smooth spectra that combine to form an absorption spectrum that is linear in wavelength over relatively short wavelength spans. If the light absorption spectrum is measured in the wavelength range around 217 to 240 nm (the exact range {{is a bit of a}} decision by the operator), then the nitrate concentration can be determined. Two different instruments based on the same optical principles are in use for this purpose. The In Situ Ultraviolet Spectrophotometer (ISUS) built at MBARI or at Satlantic has been mounted inside the pressure hull of a Teledyne/Webb Research APEX and NKE Provor <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> and the optics penetrate through the upper end cap into the water. The Satlantic Submersible Ultraviolet Nitrate Analyzer (SUNA) is placed on the outside of APEX, Provor, and Navis <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> in its own pressure housing and is connected to the float through an underwater cable that provides power and communications. Power, communications between the float controller and the sensor, and data processing requirements are essentially the same for both ISUS and SUNA. There are several possible algorithms that can be used for the deconvolution of nitrate concentration from the observed UV absorption spectrum (Johnson and Coletti, 2002; Arai et al., 2008; Sakamoto et al., 2009; Zielinski et al., 2011). In addition, the default algorithm that is available in Satlantic sensors is a proprietary approach, but this is not generally used on <b>profiling</b> <b>floats.</b> There are some tradeoffs in every approach. To date almost all nitrate sensors on <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> have used the Temperature Compensated Salinity Subtracted (TCSS) algorithm developed by Sakamoto et al. (2009), and this document focuses on that method. It is likely that there will be further algorithm development and it is necessary that the data systems clearly identify the algorithm that is used. It is also desirable that the data system allow for recalculation of prior data sets using new algorithms. To accomplish this, the float must report not just the computed nitrate, but the observed light intensity. Then, the rule to obtain only one NITRATE parameter is, if the spectrum is present then, the NITRATE should be recalculated from the spectrum while the computation of nitrate concentration can also generate useful diagnostics of data quality...|$|R

Here we use an adjoint sensitivity analysis together with a four-dimensional fluctuating oceanic current system to identify key regions for intensive monitoring by drifting <b>profiling</b> <b>float.</b> In this way we aim to maximize observational efficiency. As a scientific benchmark for the validity of our approach, we have attempted to define the ambient sensitivity of the oceanic heat content to a subtle change in water temperature within the Pacific Basin. We focus on the interannual tomultidecadal variations in particular. As a result, sensitivity signals reflecting changes in heat content exhibit a characteristic pattern in the three-dimensional continuumand have drastic temporal changes. This implies that the key regions will depend greatly on the operational timeframe of the observing system. We demonstrate a more effective geographic deployment strategy for the <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> monitoring changes in the oceanic heat content on a decadal timescale. 1...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the global}} carbon cycle and its {{variation}} requires a dense network of observations. Despite a growing data base for marine CO 2 surface observations (SOCAT v 2) {{large parts of}} the oceans still remain uncharted both in space and time (e. g., Southern Ocean, Arabian Sea). Moreover, the impact of mesoscale processes on the marine carbon cycle is still not well understood {{due to a lack of}} high resolution in situ observations. Recently, small-sized and submersible pCO 2 and O 2 sensors can be used to overcome these constraints. Thus, next to ship-based observations new platform technologies such as <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> or gliders come into reach. Two science showcases in the eastern tropical North Atlantic will be presented to demonstrate the potential of such autonomous observations: 1) Measurements of pCO 2 and O 2 performed on a <b>profiling</b> <b>float</b> were used to derive precise air-sea fluxes and production estimates which are consistent with time-series data from the Cape Verde Ocean Observatory (CVOO) and 2) a suite of synergetic autonomous O 2 observations (glider, float, mooring) revealed mesoscale processes that featured unexpected open ocean subsurface hypoxia and anoxia...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 The {{production}} and consumption of oxygen during photosynthesis and respiration stoichiometrically links oxygen and organic carbon in the surface ocean. Oxygen sensors are currently being deployed on <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> throughout the ocean, which {{has the potential to}} greatly expand the extent of in situ oxygen measurements and our understanding of biological processes in the ocean. Inaccuracies in current oxygen sensors due to instrument drift currently limit the utility of these floats for estimating air-sea oxygen fluxes. This thesis describes in situ calibrations of oxygen sensors on <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> through atmospheric measurements and the use of this data towards understanding oxygen and organic carbon cycles in the Pacific. We deployed 12 modified Argo floats equipped with Aanderaa oxygen optodes in the Pacific: one at Ocean Station Papa (OSP) in the northeast Pacific, 10 in the Kuroshio Extension (KE), and one in the south subtropical Pacific near Samoa. Air oxygen measurements after each <b>float</b> <b>profile</b> were used to accurately calibrate the optodes and correct for drift observed in approximately ½ of the optodes over > 2 years. I interpret these oxygen data using two methods. At OSP, I developed a 1 -dimensional abiotic gas model for use with oxygen data to determine the annual net community production (ANCP). I found that summertime production was roughly balanced by wintertime net heterotrophy and that estimates of bubble-induced, air-sea exchange and diapycnal diffusion {{at the base of the}} mixed layer were important to interpretation of oxygen fluxes. In the KE I interpreted data from multiple floats to determine mean annual cycles of supersaturation and air-sea oxygen fluxes from biogeochemical regions. While the magnitude of the abiotic oxygen fluxes in winter is too high to quantify ANCP in this area, I calculated summertime {{production and}} winter subduction from the regional oxygen data. This work represents an improvement in our ability to remotely measure in situ oxygen and new methods of interpretation so that a global array of oxygen sensors on <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> can be used to quantify the marine oxygen and carbon cycles...|$|R
50|$|A {{handful of}} {{companies}} and organizations manufacture <b>profiling</b> <b>floats</b> {{used in the}} Argo program. APEX floats, made by Teledyne Webb Research, {{are the most common}} element of the current array. SOLO and SOLO-II floats (the latter use a reciprocating pump for buoyancy changes, unlike screw-driven pistons in other floats) were developed at Scripps Institution of Oceanography. Other types include the NINJA float, made by the Tsurumi Seiki Co. of Japan, and the PROVOR float developed by IFREMER in France. Most floats use sensors made by Sea-Bird Electronics, which also makes a <b>profiling</b> <b>float</b> called Navis. A typical Argo float is a cylinder just over 1 metre long and 14 cm across with a hemispherical cap. Thus it has a minimum volume of about 16,600 cubic centimetres (cm3). At Ocean Station Papa in the Gulf of Alaska the temperature and salinity at the surface might be about 6 °C and 32.55 parts per thousand giving a density of sea-water of 1.0256 g/cm3. At a depth of 2000 metres (pressure of 2000 decibars) the temperature might be 2 °C and the salinity 34.58 parts per thousand. Thus, including the effect of pressure (water is slightly compressible) the density of sea-water is about 1.0369 g/cm3. The change in density divided by the deep density is 0.0109.|$|R
