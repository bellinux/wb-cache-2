I could not believe that the love of life that actuated us had been implanted in our breasts by aught other than God. It was God's will, and we His poor creatures could only obey and fulfil His will. And yet, God was kind. In His all-kindness He saved us from so terrible, though so righteous, an act.|$|E

Stone facings were used to protect the concrete tympana, the imperial eagles put back in place and the four statues repositioned accordingly during the bridge expansion.|$|E

We identify how peer reviewers define "good" interdisciplinary proposals and the rules they follow: respect for disciplinary sovereignty, deference to expertise and methodological pluralism. These rules ensure the preponderance of the voices of experts over non-experts. Panelists also adopt strategies to make other reviewers who lack expertise trust that their judgments are disinterested and unbiased, while reviewers who lack expertise {{are not afraid to}} make decisions based on idiosyncratic tastes rather than substantive quality...|$|E
40|$|This paper investigates husbands 2 ̆ 7 {{and wives}} 2 ̆ 7 {{perceptions}} of {{fairness of the}} domestic division of labour Using data from a recent national Australian survey, the paper shows that 59 per cent of women report that the division of labour in the home is fair even though they also report responsibility {{for the bulk of}} the work. On the other hand, 68 per cent of men report that the division of household labour is <b>fair.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on Thompson 2 ̆ 7 s distributive justice framework, the paper analyses the factors underlying these patterns in relation to perceptions of fairness of childcare and housework. The results show that, for both men and women, the key factor determining perceptions of fairness is the division of tasks between men and women. The amount of time spent on domestic labour is also significant, but is less important than who does what around the home. There is little support for other hypotheses relating to gender role attitudes,lime spent in paid work and financial power. The conclusion examines these findings in light of the distributive justice framework and considers their implications for understanding perceptions of fairness in households...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the birth of}} television and the modern media corporation that launched it, through {{the archives of the}} designer of the "first" set, John Vassos, a Greek-born American industrial designer, interior decorator, and illustrator (1898 - 1985). Vassos's early career is used as a case study to analyze the historical and cultural forces that shaped the emergence of this new media and the new profession of industrial design, through archival materials housed in the Archives of American Art at the Smithsonian Institution in Washington D. C. and at Syracuse University. Specifically, this thesis unites various parts of Vassos's early career, from his modernist illustrations to industrial design, through the aesthetics and practices of modernism. As RCA's lead industrial designer for over 40 years, Vassos was involved in the design and promotion of RCA's electronic products, including radios and televisions and studio equipment. Vassos also designed the new spaces carved out for their use in the home including the "living room of the future" featured at the 1939 World's <b>Fair.</b> <b>Drawing</b> from his skills as an illustrator, designer and display expert, Vassos helped develop RCA's public image at a time of its greatest expansion in radio and television manufacturing and broadcasting. This reading of Vassos's work is both diachronic, taking into account his work over the early part of his career to analyze his specific contribution and synchronic, in relationship to other designers working contemporaneously. Thus, this thesis explores Vassos's double role as a participant, with active agency within the emergence of the new field and as a subject, constrained by social roles and forces. Ranging from turnstile to the transmitter, Vassos along with other industrial designers used the streamlined aesthetic to create visual unity among mechanical and electronic products, from home to office, from subway to skyline...|$|E
