40|$|Surface and {{underground}} mining operations generate seismic ground motions which are created by chemical explosions and <b>ground</b> <b>failures.</b> It {{may come as a}} surprise to some that the <b>ground</b> <b>failures</b> (coal bumps, first caves, pillar collapses, rockbursts, etc.) can send signals whose magnitudes are as strong or stronger than those from any mining blast. A verification system that includes seismic, infrasound, hydroacoustic and radionuclide sensors is being completed as part of the CTBT. The largest mine blasts and <b>ground</b> <b>failures</b> will be detected by this system and must be identified as distinct from signals generated by small nuclear explosions. Seismologists will analyze the seismic records and presumably should be able to separate them into earthquake-like and non earthquake-like categories, using a variety of so-called seismic discriminants. Non-earthquake essentially means explosion- or implosion-like. Such signals can be generated not only by mine blasts but also by a variety of <b>ground</b> <b>failures.</b> Because it is known that single-fired chemical explosions and nuclear explosion signals of the same yield give very similar seismic records, the non-earthquake signals will be of concern to the Treaty verification community. The magnitude of the mine-related events is in the range of seismicity created by smaller nuclear explosions or decoupled tests, which are of particular concern under the Treaty. It is conceivable that legitimate mining blasts or some mine-induced <b>ground</b> <b>failures</b> could occasionally be questioned. Information such as shot time, location and design parameters may be all that is necessary to resolve the event identity. In rare instances where the legitimate origin of the event could not be resolved by a consultation and clarification procedure, it might trigger on On-Site Inspection (OSI). Because there is uncertainty in the precise location of seismic event as determined by the International Monitoring System (IMS), the OSI can cover an area of up to 1, 000 squared kilometers. In active mining districts this area could include several different mining operations. So, an OSI could be disruptive both to the mining community and to the US Government which must host the foreign inspection team. Accordingly, it is in the best interest of all US parties to try and eliminate the possible occurrence of false alarms. This can be achieved primarily by reducing the ambiguity of mine-induced seismic signals, so that even if these remain visible to the IMS they are clearly consistent with recognizable mining patterns...|$|R

The bedded blocks measure ten feet (3 meters) in diameter and they appear in landslide rubble. This shows ground disturbance which could eventually cause the land to slide.|$|E

40|$|DOI: 10. 17014 /ijog. 3. 2. 95 - 105 An {{assessment}} of surface rupture and collateral <b>ground</b> <b>failures</b> {{can help to}} evaluate the impact of future earthquakes. This paper {{presents the results of}} a field survey conducted to map the surface rupture and geotechnical phenomena associated with the ground shaking during the July 2, 2013 earthquakes in Tanah Gayo Highland. The objectives of this survey are to document and to characterize the surface ruptures as well as to identify types of earthquake-induced <b>ground</b> <b>failures.</b> Results of the survey identified four best sites of possible surface rupture. Two locations are obvious surface ruptures that can be traced on primary topographic feature of the active fault segment from the north to the south, crossing Pantan Terong Hill. The fault segment has a total mapped length of 19 km, with WNW trending zone and a dextral rupture offset. The ground shaking also resulted in landslides and liquefaction in areas underlain by very fine-grained tuffaceous sands. Based on the field survey, it can be concluded that the newly defined active fault segment, the Pantan Terong segment, is likely the segment that ruptured at the July 2, 2013 Tanah Gayo earthquake. Due to the soil types and unstable rocky slopes in the hilly Central Aceh region, large-scale landslides are primary risks during an earthquake event in this region. </p...|$|R

50|$|Earthquake {{environmental}} effects are the effects {{caused by an}} earthquake on the natural environment, including surface faulting, tectonic uplift and subsidence, tsunamis, soil liquefactions, ground resonance, landslides and <b>ground</b> <b>failure,</b> either directly linked to the earthquake source or provoked by the ground shaking.These are common features produced both in their near and far fields, routinely recorded and surveyed in recent events, very often remembered in historical accounts and preserved in the stratigraphic record (paleoearthquakes).

40|$|The 921 Chi-Chi {{earthquake}} (M-w = 7. 6) in 1999 caused extensive <b>ground</b> <b>failures</b> in {{the central}} part of Taiwan. Severe damages due to soil liquefaction and ground softening occurred widespread in Wufeng. Various phenomena such as sand boils, settlement, horizontal translation of a building, and lateral spreading associated with liquefaction and ground softening were observed in Wufeng and documented. The locations of soil liquefaction, settlement, and no observed <b>ground</b> <b>failures</b> in Wufeng were also identified, investigated, and analyzed after the earthquake. The areas of sand boils and lateral spreading are mainly located beside the creeks and match the regions of present and old river channels pretty well. In situ soil profiles and material properties of Wufeng are obtained based on 25 borings and six cone penetrometer (CPT) soundings before and after the earthquake. Results of aftershocks and data obtained from Nantou Township are compiled in the analyses to delineate the boundary of liquefaction and nonliquefaction. Data of standard penetration tests (SPT), CPT, and shear wave velocity are selected and the empirical methods recommended by an NCEER workshop were employed to evaluate the liquefaction resistance of soils. The results are also compared with the performance functions obtained through artificial neural network modeling. The SPT-based performance function has better prediction on the cases of nonliquefaction than other empirical methods do. Impacts of fines content (FC) (both nonplastic and plastic) on liquefaction resistance are also found to be profound. For SPT cases, an empirical boundary is suggested for soils with fines content larger than 35 %. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

By using conventional geophysical characterization methods, {{it is hard}} to detect detailed weak rock and fault zone which can lead underground structure to fail after excavation and before supporting. In this study, an enhanced detection system of predicting weak zones ahead of tunnel face is developed for making up the problems of the conventional characterization methods. Using the developed system, case studies are performed for detection of a spherical shaped weak zone and an oriented fault. The experimental results show that the presence of weak zones and their sizes, location, and states can be accurately predicted from electrical resistance measurements through a proper inversion process. ...|$|R
