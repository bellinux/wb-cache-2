40|$|Abstract—A InGaP/GaAs {{heterojunction}} {{bipolar transistor}} structure is proposed in which the base epi-layer underneath the extended ledge works as a <b>base</b> <b>ballast</b> resistor. The structure eliminates the critical alignment for a passivation ledge formation as well as additional process steps for external <b>base</b> <b>ballast</b> resistor. Both ballasted and unballasted devices were fabricated and compared. Small signal equivalent circuit gives us {{the magnitude of the}} effective ballast resistance. The thermal characteristics, including gain-col-lapsed – and regression curve are shown and modeled. The temper-ature dependency of base sheet resistance and its influence on the device performance are also discussed. Index Terms—Ballast resistor, InGaP/GaAs HBT, passivation ledge. I...|$|R

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} test for weak form <b>efficiency</b> <b>based</b> on the practitioner's {{approach}} to technical analysis. Previous studies typically make inferences on weak form <b>efficiency</b> <b>based</b> on the empirical results of testing only one class of technical rules-trend indicators. The practitioner's approach, on the other hand, typically involves the simultaneous use of trend indicators and other confirming indicators because trend indicators do not sufficiently capture the information content in past prices. By combining trend indicators with confirming indicators that are also based on the detection of trends in past prices, {{it is possible to}} construct a superior technical trading strategy that captures a more comprehensive aspect of predictability in past prices. Applying the technical trading rules to data on five Asian-Pacific stock markets, the evidence suggests that {{a test for}} weak form <b>efficiency</b> <b>based</b> solely on trend indicators is noisy and that the alternative test proposed in this study is significantly more effective in capturing the information content in past prices. An examination of weak form <b>efficiency</b> <b>based</b> on this alternative test suggests that weak form efficiency is determined by factors other than technological progress. ...|$|R

Frequent research on the track supporting materials shows a good result which improves the existing overall performance. Good ride quality with high speed, minimum initial construction capital, long life service and low maintenance cost are the issue on the railway technology. Ballast is one of the determinant parts of the railway structure which has great influence on the performance of the railway track. The aim of this project is to assess the different aspects which affect the overall performance on the ballast structure, its material characterization, gradation, failure modes and modelling techniques. Quality <b>based</b> <b>ballast</b> material characteristics investigation and proper selection of ballast gradation with proper modelling methods will lead to an economical, minimum defect, minimum maintenance and replacement cost. ...|$|R
