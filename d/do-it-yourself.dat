Where the iBook required substantial disassembly to access internal components such as the hard drive, users only need to remove the battery and the RAM door to replace the MacBook drive. Apple provides <b>do-it-yourself</b> manuals for these tasks.|$|E
5|$|Cluj-Napoca {{is also an}} {{important}} regional commercial centre, with many street malls and hypermarkets. Eroilor Avenue and Napoca and Memorandumului streets are the most expensive venues, with a yearly rent price of 720 euro/m², but Regele Ferdinand and 21 Decembrie 1989 avenues also feature high rental costs. There are two large malls: VIVO! (including a Carrefour hypermarket) and Iulius Mall (including an Auchan hypermarket). Other large stores include branches of various international hypermarket chains, like Cora, Metro, Selgros and <b>do-it-yourself</b> stores such as Baumax and Praktiker.|$|E
5|$|While Playford {{was known}} for his use of price {{controls}} to restrain the price of living and therefore attract blue-collar workers to settle in the state and fuel industrialisation, South Australia was slow to introduce consumer protection laws in regards to quality control. It was believed that he was opposed to compulsory pasteurisation and other quality standards on milk to avoid offending his rural support base. Playford's reluctance to introduce regulations for tradesmen such as builders, electricians and plumbers were often seen to have resulted from his being a keen <b>do-it-yourself</b> handyman.|$|E
5|$|Continuously {{variable}} phase control circuits {{are common in}} subwoofer amplifiers, and {{may be found in}} crossovers and as <b>do-it-yourself</b> electronics projects. Phase controls allow the listener to change the arrival time of the subwoofer sound waves relative to the same frequencies from the main speakers (i.e., at and around the crossover point to the subwoofer). A similar effect can be achieved with the delay control on many home theater receivers. The subwoofer phase control found on many subwoofer amplifiers is actually a polarity inversion switch. It allows users to reverse the polarity of the subwoofer relative to the audio signal it is being given. This type of control allows the subwoofer to either be in phase with the source signal, or 180 degrees out of phase.|$|E
5|$|The {{library is}} spread over four {{floors of the}} Marine Parade Community Building, with a floor area of 3,500 square metres (37,675 square feet). As {{one of the first}} {{neighbourhood}} libraries, the library's entire second floor is its children's book section, featuring murals, trivia and multimedia tools. The library has more than 150,000 books and 2,500 videos available for loan. There is a café on the ground floor, and the library is fitted with numerous couches and benches for the public's use. Other facilities include multimedia stations, <b>do-it-yourself</b> service stations, and music posts equipped with headphones.|$|E
5|$|Irvine {{is married}} to wife Rita, whom he met in a public house in Burnley. The couple were wed on 3 October 1966 and have three sons; Darren, Stephen and Jonathan, who played semi-professional {{football}} for Nelson and Colne. He {{has lived in the}} village of Worsthorne since retiring from football in 1974. Following his retirement he rented a warehouse from a friend and started a <b>do-it-yourself</b> retail business in the centre of Burnley. The shop was reasonably successful, and Irvine opened a second branch in Keighley, West Yorkshire. However, the business became untenable after several years and left Irvine owing £44,000 to the bank after a potential buyer for the shop pulled out of the deal. Following the collapse of the business, Irvine suffered severe depression and at one stage attempted suicide by taking an overdose of paracetamol tablets. He was discovered in time by his wife and admitted to Burnley General Hospital, where he underwent an emergency procedure to pump his stomach. After the attempt, he got a part-time job with Burnley Borough Council, working with young people at local community centres. He later worked as a window cleaner for 12months before selling the round for a profit. Irvine then took a job in an engineering factory, where he worked for 14years, before joining electrical firm LED. From there, he moved to Aeropia, an aircraft parts manufacturer, where he has worked as a stores manager ever since. On matchdays at Turf Moor, he gives guided tours of the ground to supporters.|$|E

25|$|In {{the post-war}} period there were {{increasing}} numbers of people who possessed gardens. This resulted in increased information on gardening on radio and TV. In 1978 the BBC began to broadcast The Beechgrove Garden, filmed in Scotland and aimed at the owners of suburban semi-detached houses. The twentieth and twenty-first centuries saw a huge increase in <b>do-it-yourself</b> gardening books and magazines.|$|E

25|$|Black Flag was {{and remains}} well-respected within the punk subculture, {{primarily}} for their tireless promotion of an autonomous DIY punk ethic and aesthetic. They are often regarded as pioneers {{in the movement}} of underground <b>do-it-yourself</b> record labels that flourished among 1980s punk rock bands. Through constant touring throughout the United States and Canada, and occasionally Europe, Black Flag established a dedicated cult following.|$|E
25|$|Sears Homes {{have become}} {{increasingly}} popular among history enthusiasts because of their sturdy structure, the <b>do-it-yourself</b> nature of construction and the popular architectural design concepts.

25|$|Other social {{movements}} exist as offshoots of queer culture or combinations of queer identity with other views. Adherents of queer nationalism {{support the notion}} that the LGBT community forms a distinct people due to their unique culture and customs. Queercore (originally homocore) is a cultural and social movement that began in the mid-1980s as an offshoot of punk expressed in a <b>do-it-yourself</b> style through zines, music, writing, art and film.|$|E
25|$|Horn {{loudspeakers}} {{can provide}} very high efficiencies, making {{them a good}} match for very low-powered amplifiers, such as single-ended triode amps or other tube amplifiers. After WWII, some early hi-fi fans {{went so far as}} to build low frequency horns whose mouths took up much of a wall of the listening room. The throats were sometimes outside on the lawn, or in the basement. With the coming of stereo in the 1960s, this approach was rarely seen. Many loudspeaker buyers and <b>do-it-yourself</b> loudspeaker fans sought smaller designs for aesthetic reasons.|$|E
25|$|The {{complete}} technical {{disclosure of}} the Columbia LP by Peter C. Goldmark, Rene' Snepvangers and William S. Bachman in 1949 {{made it possible for}} a great variety of record companies to get into the business of making long playing records. The business grew quickly and interest spread in high fidelity sound and the <b>do-it-yourself</b> market for pickups, turntables, amplifier kits, loudspeaker enclosure plans, and AM/FM radio tuners. The LP record for longer works, 45rpm for pop music, and FM radio became high fidelity program sources in demand. Radio listeners heard recordings broadcast and this in turn generated more record sales. The industry flourished.|$|E
25|$|In January 1905, small {{advertisements}} {{were placed}} in the Automobile and Cycle Trade Journal offering bare Harley-Davidson engines to the <b>do-it-yourself</b> trade. By April, complete motorcycles were in production on a very limited basis. That year, the first Harley-Davidson dealer, Carl H. Lang of Chicago, sold three bikes from the five built in the Davidson backyard shed. Years later the original shed was taken to the Juneau Avenue factory where it would stand for many decades as a tribute to the Motor Company's humble origins until it was accidentally destroyed by contractors cleaning the factory yard in the early 1970s.|$|E

Super 8 Film Festival (Toronto) and compiling and editing a reference book of hand-crafted film techniques (Recipes for Disaster: A Handcrafted Film Cookbooklet (2001, revised 2004, 2006). After Hurricane Katrina, Hill's interests in film expanded into archiving. She gave talks at CalArts, the University of South Carolina, and other venues, promoting <b>do-it-yourself</b> techniques for archiving and restoring motion picture film.

25|$|Bode {{was an avid}} {{reader in}} his spare time. He also co-wrote Counting House, a fictional story, with his wife Barbara which was {{published}} by Harper's magazine in August 1936. Bode also enjoyed boating. Early on in his career, while working for Bell Labs in New York, he used to sail-boat on Long Island Sound. After World War II, he bought a surplus landing craft (LCT) with which he explored {{the upper reaches of}} the Chesapeake Bay near the eastern shore of Maryland. He also enjoyed gardening and <b>do-it-yourself</b> projects. He was married to Barbara Bode (nee Poore). Together they had two children; Dr. Katharine Bode Darlington and Mrs. Anne Hathaway Bode Aarnes.|$|E
25|$|The American punk and indie rock movements, {{which had}} been largely {{underground}} since the early 1980s, became part of mainstream culture during the mid-1990s. With Nirvana's success, major record labels capitalized on the popularity of alternative rock and other underground music by signing and promoting independent bands. In 1994, {{the same year that}} Jawbreaker's 24 Hour Revenge Therapy and Sunny Day Real Estate's Diary were released, Green Day and the Offspring had multi-platinum success with Dookie and Smash. After underground music went mainstream, emo retreated and reformed as a national subculture over the next few years. Inspired by Jawbreaker, Drive Like Jehu and Fugazi, the new emo was a mixture of hardcore punk passion and indie-rock intelligence, with punk rock's anthemic power and <b>do-it-yourself</b> work ethic but smoother songs, sloppier melodies and yearning vocals.|$|E
25|$|Plasma arc {{loudspeakers}} use electrical plasma as a radiating element. Since plasma has minimal mass, but {{is charged}} {{and therefore can}} be manipulated by an electric field, {{the result is a}} very linear output at frequencies far higher than the audible range. Problems of maintenance and reliability for this approach tend to make it unsuitable for mass market use. In 1978 Alan E. Hill of the Air Force Weapons Laboratory in Albuquerque, NM, designed the Plasmatronics Hill Type I, a tweeter whose plasma was generated from helium gas. This avoided the ozone and nitrous oxide produced by RF decomposition of air in an earlier generation of plasma tweeters made by the pioneering DuKane Corporation, who produced the Ionovac (marketed as the Ionofane in the UK) during the 1950s. Currently, there remain a few manufacturers in Germany who use this design, and a <b>do-it-yourself</b> design has been published and has been available on the Internet.|$|E
25|$|The Tinkering Studio {{began in}} 2008 as an {{in-house}} program geared towards maker culture and a “think with your hands” approach. It is housed within {{the museum in}} a dedicated space in the South Gallery, where it runs free <b>do-it-yourself</b> activities for museum visitors; it also shares its work with a larger audience of educators in afterschool programs, schools, museums and other learning environments. It is being cited as a prototype for similar programs across the globe, including South Korea, Canada, India, and Saudi Arabia. The Exploratorium also operates as afterschool tinkering program in partnership with San Francisco chapters of the Boys and Girls Club. In 2012 the Exploratorium was awarded a grant to create the California Tinkering Network, {{in collaboration with the}} Community Science Workshops, Techbridge, the Discovery Science Center, the California Afterschool Network, and the California STEM Learning Network. These organizations partner with over 20 local afterschool or summer programs to provide STEM-enriched activities for children in underserved communities. The initiative was designed to test an adaptable model for providing tinkering activities to promote learning and development in an afterschool setting.|$|E
