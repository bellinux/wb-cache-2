The No. 1 acknowledged challenge of constructing an OTEC plant is the Cold Water Pipe (CWP), which draws cold water from 1000 m depths up to the surface, {{to serve as the}} coolant for the OTEC Rankine cycle. For a commercial-scale plant, the CWP is on the order of 10 m in diameter. This report describes work done by LMSSC developing the CWP for LM MS 2 New Ventures emerging OTEC business. The work started in early 2008 deciding on the minimum-cost CWP architecture, materials, and fabrication process. In order to eliminate what in previous OTEC work had been a very large assembly/deployment risk, we took the innovative approach of building an integral CWP directly from theOTEC platform and down into the water. During the latter half of 2008, we proceeded to a successful small-scale Proof-of-Principles validation of the new fabrication process, at the Engineering Development Lab in Sunnyvale. During 2009 - 10, under the Cooperative Agreement with the US Dept. of Energy, we have now successfully validated key elements of the process and apparatus at a 4 m diameter scale suitable for a future OTEC Pilot Plant. The validations include: (1) Assembly of sandwich core rings from pre-pultruded hollow 'planks,' holding final dimensions accurately; (2) Machine-based dispensing of overlapping strips of thick fiberglass fabric to form the lengthwise-continuous face sheets, holding accurate overlap dimensions; (3) Initial testing of the fabric architecture, showing that the overlap splices develop adequate mechanical strength (work done under a parallel US Naval Facilities Command program); and (4) Successful resin infusion/cure of 4 m diameter workpieces, obtaining full wet-out and a non-discernable <b>knitline</b> between successive stepwise infusions...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} {{methodology}} {{for creating a}} simulated foam microstructure for use in forward simulations of wave equations to quantitatively analyze the expected scattering phenomenon primarily responsible for the attenuation of interrogating signals in Sprayed-On Foam Insulation (SOFI). Our approach builds off of the popular use of Voronoi Tessalations for crystal growth modeling by using the Laguerre variant (Apollonius Graph) applied to close-packed spheres. A fi lled-in random raindrop algorithm is used to generate the packing confi guration. Lastly, variation of diameter mean values is used to model <b>knitlines,</b> i. e., the interfaces between sprayed-on layers...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{evaluation}} of the basic fracture properties of Thermal Protection System (TPS) polyurethane foam insulation materials was conducted to validate the methodology used in estimating critical defect sizes in TPS applications on the Space Shuttle External Fuel Tank. The polyurethane foam found on the External Tank (ET) is manufactured by mixing liquid constituents and allowing them to react and expand upwards - a process which creates component cells that are generally elongated in the foam rise direction and gives rise to mechanical anisotropy. Similarly, the application of successive foam layers to the ET produces cohesive foam interfaces (<b>knitlines)</b> which may lead to local variations in mechanical properties. This study reports the fracture toughness of BX- 265, NCFI 24 - 124, and PDL- 1034 closed-cell polyurethane foam {{as a function of}} ambient and cryogenic temperatures and knitline/cellular orientation at ambient pressure...|$|R
