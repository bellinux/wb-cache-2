5|$|On Independence Day and Republic Day, {{patriotic}} {{songs in}} regional languages are broadcast {{on television and}} radio channels. They are also played alongside flag hoisting ceremonies. Patriotic films are broadcast. Over the decades, according to The Times of India, {{the number of such}} films broadcast has decreased as channels report that audiences are oversaturated with patriotic films. The population cohort that belong to the <b>Generation</b> <b>Next</b> often combine nationalism with popular culture during the celebrations. This mixture is exemplified by outfits and savouries dyed with the tricolour and designer garments that represent India's various cultural traditions. Retail stores offer Independence Day sales promotions. Some news reports have decried the commercialism. Indian Postal Service publishes commemorative stamps depicting independence movement leaders, nationalistic themes and defence-related themes on 15 August.|$|E
