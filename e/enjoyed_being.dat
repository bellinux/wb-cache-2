5|$|From batting in the middle-order, Ganteaume was {{eventually}} promoted {{to open the}} batting as a theory at the time suggested that wicketkeepers might make good openers as they became accustomed to the conditions while keeping wicket; Ganteaume neither believed this theory nor <b>enjoyed</b> <b>being</b> an opener. He scored his maiden first-class century in 1946; a second followed later in the year.|$|E

5|$|Michael takes relish {{in being}} able to freely {{proclaim}} his relationship with Jan to his bosses, making Jan uncomfortable. She eventually pulls him aside and tries to get him to have sex with her in the bathroom. Michael refuses and she becomes angry. As they drive home together, Jan hypothesizes that she only <b>enjoyed</b> <b>being</b> with Michael because their relationship was undisclosed and therefore unethical, and that disclosing it was a mistake. Michael is hurt and upset at this, and Jan takes back her comments to keep him from crying.|$|E

5|$|After {{an attempt}} on Paul Robinson's (Stefan Dennis) life, Mark is {{introduced}} {{as the lead}} detective in the case. When he received conflicting information from the suspects he interviews, Mark struggled to identify the culprit. McGregor told a writer from SX News that he <b>enjoyed</b> <b>being</b> involved in the storyline, as he had never had that much responsibility before. To prepare for the role, McGregor chose to research his character's job. Mark was described as being handsome, charming and a perfectionist. He was dedicated to {{his job as a}} police detective and often put his work ahead of everything else. As a consequence, Mark struggled to balance his work and personal lives. McGregor stated that he shared some similarities with Mark and he enjoyed getting into character.|$|E
5|$|Christopher Douglas {{argues that}} Jardine liked {{to make his}} runs when his side was in {{difficulty}} and <b>enjoyed</b> <b>being</b> tested; his approach would often lead his team to recovery from an unfavourable situation. Douglas comments that Jardine held {{his place in the}} England side despite strong competition from other batsmen. His defensive technique rescued England from weak positions in around a dozen innings and only played in two losses with England (which were his two least successful games with the bat). He also excelled in the main Gentlemen v Players fixture at Lord's, making a good score in each of his appearances in this match. Jack Hobbs classed him as a great batsman and believed that he was under-rated by his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Glover {{had started}} her {{modelling}} career early, when {{at the age}} of 9, a photographer noticed her on a shopping trip with her mother, and compared her to a young version of Lorraine Chase from the British TV show Emmerdale. Glover found she <b>enjoyed</b> <b>being</b> photographed, and planned to become a professional model from the age of 12. She began entering modelling contests {{at the age of}} 14, and beauty pageants, to get noticed as a model. She was a regional finalist for the beauty title Miss Great Britain at the age of 17, and traveled to London to be a national finalist at the age of 18, while studying Holistic Therapy at St Helens College.|$|E

5|$|In {{the ensuing}} {{reshuffle}} in Vienna Johann Philipp Stadion became the Austrian foreign minister, freeing Metternich {{to assume the}} post of Ambassador to the Russian Empire. He {{never made it to}} Russia, as need had arisen for a new Austrian at the French court. Metternich was approved for the post in June 1806. He <b>enjoyed</b> <b>being</b> in demand and was happy to be sent to France on a generous salary of 90,000 gulden a year. After an arduous trip he took up residence in August 1806, being briefed by Baron von Vincent and Engelbert von Floret, whom he would retain as a close adviser for two decades. He met French foreign minister Charles Talleyrand on 5 August and Napoleon himself five days later at Saint-Cloud; soon, the War of the Fourth Coalition drew both Talleyrand and Napoleon eastwards. Metternich's wife and children joined him in October, and he went into society, using his charm to win great eminence there. The presence of Eleonore did not prevent him from a series of affairs that certainly included Napoleon's sister Caroline Murat, Laure Junot, and perhaps many besides.|$|E
5|$|Matilda {{had been}} educated in a {{sequence}} of convents, however, and may well have taken the vows to formally become a nun, which formed an obstacle to the marriage progressing. She {{did not wish to}} be a nun and appealed to Anselm for permission to marry Henry, and the Archbishop established a council at Lambeth Palace to judge the issue. Despite some dissenting voices, the council concluded that although Matilda had lived in a convent, she had not actually become a nun and was therefore free to marry, a judgement that Anselm then affirmed, allowing the marriage to proceed. Matilda proved an effective queen for Henry, acting as a regent in England on occasion, addressing and presiding over councils, and extensively supporting the arts. The couple soon had two children, Matilda, born in 1102, and William Adelin, born in 1103; it is possible that they also had a second son, Richard, who died young. Following the birth of these children, Matilda preferred to remain based in Westminster while Henry travelled across England and Normandy, either for religious reasons or because she <b>enjoyed</b> <b>being</b> involved in the machinery of royal governance.|$|E

50|$|While {{many people}} assume {{that other people}} enjoy tickling, {{a recent survey of}} 84 college {{students}} indicated that only 32% of respondents <b>enjoy</b> <b>being</b> tickled, with 32% giving neutral responses and 36% stating that they do not <b>enjoy</b> <b>being</b> tickled. The study also found a very high level of embarrassment and anxiety associated with tickling. However, in the same study the authors found that the facial indicators of happiness and amusement do not correlate, with some people who indicated that they do not <b>enjoy</b> <b>being</b> tickled actually smiling more often during tickling than those who indicated that they do <b>enjoy</b> <b>being</b> tickled, which suggests that there may be other factors at play (such as embarrassment and anxiety) in the case of those who indicated a dislike for tickling than the mere physical sensation experienced. It has also been suggested that people may enjoy tickling because it elicits laughter as well as the feeling of being tickled. Social psychologists find that mimicking expressions generally cause people to some degree experience that emotion.|$|R

25|$|With {{the arrival}} of the Seljuq Turks in the late 11th century, Damascus again became the capital of {{independent}} states. It was ruled by Abu Sa'id Taj ad-Dawla Tutush I starting in 1079 and he was succeeded by his son Abu Nasr Duqaq in 1095. The Seljuqs established a court in Damascus and a systematic reversal of Shia inroads in the city. The city also saw an expansion of religious life through private endowments financing religious institutions (madrasas) and hospitals (maristans). Damascus soon {{became one of the most}} important centres of propagating Islamic thought in the Muslim world. After Duqaq's death in 1104, his mentor (atabeg), Toghtekin, took control of Damascus and the Burid line of the Seljuq dynasty. Under Duqaq and Toghtekin, Damascus experienced stability, elevated status and a revived role in commerce. In addition, the city's Sunni majority <b>enjoyed</b> <b>being</b> a part of the larger Sunni framework effectively governed by various Turkic dynasties who in turn were under the moral authority of the Baghdad-based Abbasids.|$|E
