40|$|AbSTRACT Habitat {{suitability}} (HS) modeling relates {{a species}} ’ potential presence/ab-sence {{to a set}} of environmental variables. because of stochastic or demo-graphic population fluctuations, relating abundance to environment is difficult and generally requires time-series of population-density data. Here, I propose an approach to compute relative capacity of a set of habitat classes. I defined relative capacity of a <b>habitat</b> <b>class</b> as being proportional to its carrying capac-ity, and replaced time-series of density measures with spatial replicates. A hypothetical environment was first divided into several habitat classes and population densities were measured in a sample of these habitats. Three meth-ods of computing relative capacity were compared: (1) maximum density per <b>habitat</b> <b>class,</b> (2) coefficients of a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) of the habitat densities, and (3) slopes of isodars computed for all pairs of habitat classes. Accuracy of these methods was evaluated using spatially-explicit demographic simulations. I investigated biological assumptions (species’ sensitivity, reactivity and selectivity, regional stochasticity) and sampling de-sign (sample size, distance between pairs of habitat classes, number of habitat classes, uncertainty over abundance). GLM and maximum-density methods provided accurate results when at least five site-pairs were available. Isodars outperformed other methods in landscapes with many habitat classes, but are best suited to large or noise-free data sets. Optimal performance was reached with more than 50 site-pairs and five habitat classes...|$|E

Measuring and reliable reporting of trends and changes in biodiversity requiresamongst others detailed and accurate land cover and habitat maps in a standard and comparable way. The objective {{of this paper is to}} assess the EODHaM (EO Data for Habitat Mapping) classification resultsfor a Dutch case study. The EODHaM system was developed within the BIO SOS (The BIOdiversity multi-SOurce monitoring System: from Space TO Species) project and contains the decision rules for each landcover and <b>habitat</b> <b>class</b> based on spectral and height information. One of the main findings is that canopyheight models, as derived from LiDAR, in combination with very high resolution satellite imagery providesa powerful input for the EODHaM system for the purpose of generic land cover and habitat mapping forany location across the globe. The assessment of the EODHaM classification results based on field datashowed an overall accuracy of 74 % for the land cover classes as described according to the Food andAgricultural Organization (FAO) Land Cover Classification System (LCCS) taxonomy at level 3, while theoverall accuracy was lower (69. 0 %) for the habitat map based on the General Habitat Category (GHC) system for habitat surveillance and monitoring. A GHC <b>habitat</b> <b>class</b> is determined for each mapping uniton the basis of the composition of the individual life forms and height measurements. The classificationshowed very good results for forest phanerophytes (FPH) when individual life forms were analyzed interms of their percentage coverage estimates per mapping unit from the LCCS classification and validatedwith field surveys. Analysis for shrubby chamaephytes (SCH) showed less accurate results, but might alsobe due to less accurate field estimates of percentage coverage. Overall, the EODHaM classification resultsencouraged us to derive the heights of all vegetated objects in the Netherlands from LiDAR data, inpreparation for new habitat classifications...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Recently the {{independent}} multinomial selections model (IMS) with the multinomial logit link {{has been suggested}} as an analysis tool for radio-telemetry habitat selection data. This model assumes independence between animals, independence between sightings within an animal, and identical multinomial habitat selection probabilities for all animals. We propose two generalizations to the IMS model. The first generalization is to allow a Markov chain dependence between consecutive sightings of the same animal. This generalization allows for both positive correlation (individuals persisting in the same <b>habitat</b> <b>class</b> {{in which they were}} previously sighted) and negative correlation (individual vacating the <b>habitat</b> <b>class</b> in which they were previously sighted). The second generalization is to allow for heterogeneity. Here, a hierarchical Dirichlet-multinomial distribution is used to allow for variability in selection probabilities between animals. This generalization accounts for over-dispersion of selection probabilities and allows for inference to the population of animals, assuming that the animals studied constitute a random sample from that population [...] Both generalizations are one parameter extensions to the multinomial logit model and allow for testing the assumptions of identical multinomial selection probabilities and independence. These tests are performed using the score, Wald, and asymptotic likelihood ratio statistics. Estimates of model parameters are obtained using maximum likelihood techniques, and habitat characteristics are tested using drop-in-deviance statistics. Using example data, we show that persistence and heterogeneity exist in habitat selection data and illustrate the difference in analysis results between the IMS model and the persistence and heterogeneity models. Through simulation, we show that analyzing persistence data assuming independence between sightings within an animal gives liberal tests of significance for habitat characteristics when the data are generated with positive correlation and conservative tests of significance when the data are generated with negative correlation. Similarly, we show that analyzing heterogeneous data, assuming identical multinomial selection probabilities, gives liberal tests of significance for habitat characteristics...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of our study}} was to characterize the trophic connections of the dominant fishes of the deep-pelagic region of the northern Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) with respect to vertical distribution using carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) stable isotope analysis. Our goals were to identify previously unknown or underestimated trophic linkages for those fishes with unknown diets and confirm diet classifications of those fishes for which data are available. We analyzed a recently collected data set of 48 mesopelagic, bathypelagic and bathydemersal fishes that were collected between Iceland and the Azores as part of MAR-ECO, an international field project of the Census of Marine Life (CoML). Both stable isotopes were increasingly enriched with increasing <b>habitat</b> <b>class</b> depth. The stable isotope data had a strongly linear relationship, implying reliance on a single organic matter source with an isotopic signature {{that is consistent with}} pelagic production. Based on N stable isotope signatures, the mean trophic levels ranged from 1. 8 to 5. 7, also increasing with increasing <b>habitat</b> <b>class</b> depth. Over half of the zooplankton and micronekton species analyzed were at about trophic level 3, indicating they were zooplanktivorous. Nearly half of the mesopelagic fishes had a trophic level of ca. 4, indicating consumption of a mix of zooplankton, micronekton and small myctophids. The largest group of fishes, 23 species, were feeding at about trophic level 4. 5, indicating consumption of large mysids and other micronekton or mesopelagic fishes or both. The highest trophic levels estimated were among the bathydemersal fishes; nine species had a trophic level of 4. 8 or higher, though levels could be overestimated if these fishes were utilizing benthic energy, as well. Overall, the data are consistent with widespread opportunistic feeding in the deep sea; many species shared similar trophic levels because omnivory was common. There was evidence of widespread consumption of diel-migrating organisms, which is a plausible mechanism for direct energy transport into the bathyal region...|$|E

40|$|Our {{aim was to}} {{investigate}} the oviposition and larval habitats of the saltwater mosquito Aedes vigilax (Skuse) (Diptera: Culicidae) in a mangrove forest system in subtropical Queensland, Australia. Eggshells (indicators of oviposition) and larvae were sampled in three <b>habitat</b> <b>classes</b> that were depicted in a schematic model. Two classes were in depressions or basins, either with hummocks or dense pneumatophore substrates, both of which retained water after tidal flooding. The third class was in freely flushed mangroves that corresponded with more frequent tidal connections than the depression classes. ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer tests were used to analyze the data. The null hypotheses were rejected: the hummock class was a significant habitat based on both eggshell and larval data. The conclusion was that mosquito production in the mangrove system was distributed unevenly between <b>habitat</b> <b>classes,</b> and that the hummock class had conditions suited to the requirements of the immature stages of Ae. vigilax. This research has the potential to inform mosquito management strategies by focusing treatment on the problem habitats and underpinning habitat modifications including reducing water retention in the basins.

40|$|A major {{challenge}} for population ecology {{is to be}} able to predict population sizes in novel conditions, as in those following habitat loss or translocation. To do this successfully, we show here that it is necessary to understand the behavioral basis of dispersal decisions as they affect fitness. The Seychelles warbler, like many socially complex species, lives in family groups. This leads to the stable usage of sink habitats through kin competition. Sink usage means that bird density is not representative of habitat quality, and consequently that simple extrapolations from current habitat occupancy mis-estimate the effects of habitat loss. Similarly, per territory reproductive success for Seychelles warblers declines with density within a <b>habitat</b> <b>class,</b> in common with many territorial species. This too undermines the use of simple extrapolations to predict the consequences of habitat loss. Retrospective predictions for two actual translocations show some success, while the extent to which they fail emphasizes the need for full understanding of the links between the environment occupied and reproductive success. ...|$|E

The labeling process, although intended to be automated, was complicated due to a strong many-to-one relationship between gridcodes and habitat types. The automated search for specific habitats based on their expected elevation, landform, geology, and land cover characteristics was confounded by habitats systems with multiple class values in the data input variables (e.g., the same habitat system could exist in elevation classes 0 - 500  m, and 500 - 1000  m). Gridcodes not assigned into a <b>habitat</b> <b>class</b> by the automated labeling procedure described above were therefore subsequently labeled in a manual, interpretive process which considered gridcode similarity (i.e., variation in class values in input variables), and in particular, similarity in land cover types.|$|E

40|$|The EUNIS-compliant {{information}} on Seabed Habitats {{that is currently}} available from the EMODNET portal covers {{only about half of}} the European Union (EU) waters in the Northeast Atlantic and adjacent Seas with EU outermost regions {{in other parts of the}} Atlantic or in the Indian Ocean still remaining out of the exercise. These gaps limit the geographical comprehensiveness of any studies on seabed-related Ecosystem Functions and Services. However, separate broad-scale seabed habitat mapping sources offer complementary seabed-related geospatial information that can be straightforwardly or, after some basic GIS processing, translated into EUNIS classes. This work focused on expeditiously obtaining a comprehensive coverage of permanently submerged seabed habitats (i. e., EUNIS classes A 3 to A 6) throughout most of the EU marine waters. This was achieved by bringing in, and harmonizing where need, complementary EUNIS-compliant broad-scale geospatial information from the UNEP’s Global Seafloor Geomorphic Features Map (GSGFM). The new geospatial dataset obtained, a polygon shapefile, extends for approximately 8. 7 million km 2 and more than doubles the coverage of EUNIS seabed <b>habitat</b> <b>classes</b> when compared to the datasets available from the EMODNET Seabed Habitats portal. The new information details more than 90 % of the EU waters down to EUNIS level 2 and 3, improving EMODNET datasets by populating the deep-sea and offshore areas with previously disregarded geomorphic-based EUNIS <b>habitat</b> <b>classes.</b> Conversely, it is acknowledged that the GSGFM data could did not bring in any relevant information concerning EUNIS shelf habitats. The methodology and some area-based statistics on seabed habitat are presented, including overall and basin-specific mapped extents. It is noted that the mapping and quantification of several habitat extents are still geographically biased and underestimate the actual extent of the habitat. A comprehensive and homogeneous coverage of all EU seabed is expected in 2016 from the EMODNET Seabed Habitats programme.

40|$|Abstract Habitat {{diversity}} {{is a widely}} used criterion for locating conservation activities such as protected areas. Most habitat diversity indices are measures of alpha di-versity at the scale of habitats and are therefore insensi-tive to the underlying biological differences between habitats. To incorporate such inter-habitat differences, a new method is presented which calculates a measure of beta (β) diversity from pixels within a window passed throughout a habitat map. To avoid confusion with β di-versity indices, the new measure is called β-dissimilarity. β-Dissimiliarity is calculated from the mean Bray-Curtis dissimilarity, Dm, of field data which comprise each <b>habitat</b> <b>class.</b> The variance of Dm distinguishes discreteβ-dissimilarity distributions from homogenous patterns.

ES associated with livestock keeping and fodder production are recorded as having the highest fraction of positive impacts on SPAs, ranging from 88 % and 78 % in the Boreal biogeographic region to 20 % and 6 % in the Mediterranean. The use of ES varied according to dominant <b>habitat</b> <b>class,</b> highlighting the dependence of specific ES on associated ecosystem functions. For instance, fibre production was the predominant ES throughout forest habitats while crop, fodder and livestock exhibit similar patterns of dominance across agricultural landscapes.

Introduction: The surficial geologic habitat maps for Oregon and Washington are thematic maps, they show the distribution of benthic habitat classes over the continental margin of Oregon and Washington. Traditionally, map accuracy has simply described positional accuracy (e. g. elevations given are + or – 10 meters). A thematic map of marine geologic habitat, the product of an interpretative process, introduces another type of accuracy termed “Thematic Accuracy”. Thematic Accuracy deals with the misidentification or omission of a <b>habitat</b> <b>class.</b> An assessment of thematic accuracy for the geologic habitat maps is needed as the maps are implemented in high level decision making processes and modeling efforts. To address this problem a map set of weighted data-density is produced.

Locations {{were obtained from the}} ground and classified to one of six habitats based on stand structure, and digitally overlaid onto a habitat map produced from a LANDSAT Thematic Mapper scene of the study area. Home range sizes were calculated using the 95 % adaptive kernel and 95 % minimum convex polygon methods. To analyze habitat associations, a total of 1, 073 locations were entered into a geographic information system alongwith habitat attribute data obtained from digital coverages. Logistic regression and other statistical techniques were used to determine variables significantly associated with bear locations, including <b>habitat</b> <b>class,</b> patch size, slope, elevation, aspect, edge type, and distance to roads, streams, and edges. Female black bear home ranges averaged 32 km 2 (95 % adaptive kernel method) and 30 km 2 (95 % minimum convex polygon method). Home range size was significantly affected by individual variation among bears, most likely due to differences in food availability within each bear's home range. Female bears inhabited geographically stable home ranges from year to year and tolerated home range overlap with other female bears. Habitat use within home ranges shifte...|$|E
40|$|Producing {{coral reef}} benthic habitat maps from {{acoustic}} backscatter has been hindered by uncertainties {{in interpreting the}} acoustic energy parameters E 1 (roughness) and E 2 (hardness), typically limiting such maps to sediment classification schemes. In this study acoustic interpretation was guided by high-resolution LADS (Laser Airborne Depth Sounder) bathymetry. The acoustic survey was conducted in Palm Beach County, FL, from inshore sand to outer reef slope, using a multiplexed echosounder (BioSonics DT-X at 38 2 ̆ 6 418 kHz). E 1 and E 2 values, empirically normalized to mean depth, were compared to spatially-coincident values of a LADS-derived proxy for topographic complexity (Reef-Volume) and eight LADS=delineated benthic <b>habitat</b> <b>classes.</b> The 38 and 418 kHZ E 1 parameters were positively correlated with Reef-Volume, {{in agreement with the}} general empirical basis for bottom seabed classification. The opposite trend was observed for the 38 and 418 kHz E 2 parameters, contrary to convention, which would predict an increasing trend of E 2 from sand (soft, flat) to colonized pavement (hard, flat). Tukey HSD testing proved all four acoustic parameters capable of distinguishing between habitats; significant differences ranged from 25 - 27 of the k(k- 1) / 2 = 28 comparisons between the eight habitat categories. An a posteriori discriminant analysis of each frequency, paring E 1 and E 2 as predictor variables, showed that the 418 kHz signal provided superior predictive accuracy for six (consolidated from eight) <b>habitat</b> <b>classes</b> (74. 3 versus 68. 2...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} using 1 m {{resolution}} of panchromatic ikonos image and 2. 44 m resolution of multispectral quickbird image for mapping coral reef habitat at subtidal zone. The habitat map {{was produced by}} using unsupervised method combined with visual RGB image verification at two map scales, 1 : 10. 000 and 1 : 5000. Simple field observation found that 4 <b>habitat</b> <b>classes</b> may evaluated: live coral, seagrass mixed with sand, sand and mixed coral. Different map scale results on different level of accuracy. In case of quickbird image, the larger map scale may result on more accurate level, meanwhile opposite condition may found at ikonos image...|$|R
40|$|A {{quantitative}} and systematic approach to {{marine protected area}} (MPA) design is now common practice world-wide, yet many pre-existing MPAs have been developed without explicit goals {{and are likely to}} require incremental refinement as new knowledge is gained. In particular, there is a growing need to consider the effects of climate change. However, there has been limited research addressing the incremental incorporation of climate change resilience features into MPA design. This study used MARXAN conservation planning software with fine-scale, remotely-sensed, shallow water (< 20 m) bathymetry and habitat maps, empirical benthic community data from deeper water, and comprehensive socio-economic information from Ningaloo Marine park. It, assessed the representation of benthic habitats within the current marine park zones, identified priority areas of high resilience for inclusion within sanctuary zones and examined if any iterative refinements to the current sanctuary zones are necessary. Of the 65 <b>habitat</b> <b>classes,</b> 16 were less than ideally represented within the current sanctuary zones; most of these <b>habitat</b> <b>classes</b> were in deeper offshore waters. These deeper areas also demonstrated the highest resilience values and, as such, MARXAN outputs suggested minor increases to the current Sanctuary zones in the deeper offshore areas. Incorporation of the recent data and a systematic approach for the new Ningaloo Marine Park management plan for the next decade can refine representative marine park zones. In addition, the study also demonstrated that inclusion of climate change resilience factors within the design process for MPAs is feasible and can be applied to future marine conservation planning practice; on a global scale...|$|R
