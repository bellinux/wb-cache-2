60|$|That any evil {{directly}} {{follows from}} the closest interbreeding has been denied by many persons; but rarely by any practical breeder; and never, as far as I know, by one who has largely bred animals which propagate their kind quickly. Many physiologists attribute the evil exclusively to the combination and consequent increase of morbid tendencies common to both parents; {{and that this is}} an active source of mischief there can be no doubt. It is unfortunately too notorious that men and various domestic animals endowed with a wretched constitution, and with a strong <b>hereditary</b> <b>disposition</b> to disease, if not actually ill, are fully capable of procreating their kind. Close interbreeding, on the other hand, often induces sterility; and this indicates something quite distinct from the augmentation of morbid tendencies common to both parents. The evidence immediately to be given convinces me that it is a great law of nature, that all organic beings profit from an occasional cross with individuals not closely related to them in blood; and that, on the other hand, long-continued close interbreeding is injurious.|$|E
40|$|Mankind is {{nowadays}} {{faced with}} many different challenges (both concerning man’s knowledge {{as well as}} man’s practical conduct) {{brought about by the}} exploration of the molecular basis of heredity. Many entwined questions arise: is genetic knowledge relevant to the comprehension of nature in general and of man’s vision of himself in particular? Faced with the new possibilities of insight and intervention in human genom, how should we conceive nature (both human as well as non-human) ? Modern molecular biology has demonstrated that our genetic patrimony must not be considered throughly and completely determined; on the contrary it constitutes an aray of possible dispositions, on which we have the possibility to intervene, therefore changing our destiny. The insight in man’s genom has therefore on one side made our personal and <b>hereditary</b> <b>dispositions</b> accessible and comprehensible to us (thus producing a new concept of destiny); on the other side human genetics makes it possible for everyone to change his/her personal genetic constitution or that of his/her descendants, and therefore indicates a previously unknown way of autonomous behaviour. The ethical judgement of the above mentioned possibilities on one side questions the legitimacy of the aims and on the other analyses whether a justification of the tools used for these purposes is possible. The difference between therapeutic and non-therapeutic interventions or between somatic interventions on individuals and interventions on the germinal line (which will influence also the following generations) are to be considered part of the aim’s question, whereas the moral analysis of the means is oriented towards the unconditional respect of the autonomy of those involved and towards a manifold evaluation of benefits, drawbacks and risks...|$|R
40|$|Left {{ventricular}} Non-Compaction-Cardiomyopathy (LVNC) is a so far underinvestigated myocardial disease, {{compared to}} hypertrophic or dilatative cardiomyopathies. Nevertheless, LVNC as primary genetic disorder recently started gaining in importance. It {{is attributed to}} an arrest of the myocardial compaction process during morphogenesis of the myocardium. To date, {{it has been shown}} that LVNC is connected with sarcomeric proteins often carrying mutations. Myomesin 2 is responsible for the proper crosslink between titin and myosin and therefore indispensable for accurate sarcomer function. There is already evidence between defined mutations and cardiomyopathy in the context of myomesin 1. Therefore and given the structural and functional homology within the member-proteins of the myomesin gene-family it stands to reason to also analyze other family representatives, (e. g. myomesin 2 or 3) in regard to pathologically relevant mutations. MYOM- 2, as an interesting candidate gene for LVNC, was analyzed in the scope of this study. For this purpose genomic DNA of 52 LVNC patients was assessed using molecular-genetic methods. Each of the 37 exons of MYOM- 2 were amplified by PCR and subsequently sequenced for variations. This procedure resulted in identifying six unknown non-synonymous variations within exons 14, 20, 25 and 26, as well as two unknown synonymous variations within exons 2 and 19. The unknown non-synonymous variations are located in immunglobulin-like and fibronectin-type-III-like domains. These domains are vital for protein-protein-interactions between myomesin 2 and other M-band-components. The collected data were compared with a set of genomic DNA from 400 healthy individuals, in which none of the six variations was found. Beyond that, numerous known synonymous and non-synonymous SNPs were confirmed. In order to clarify the relevance of the found variations future studies could focus on further LVNC patients with <b>hereditary</b> <b>dispositions</b> as well as analyze the biophysical and biochemical characteristics of the altered domains described in this study...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{examines}} {{the impact of}} socio-cultural environment {{on the development of}} musical talent among pupils in the 2 nd three years of primary school. Thesis begins with {{a closer look at the}} definition of giftedness, which may be general or specific (partial). Specific giftedness means that children achieve above-average results in one area only, while general gifted children achieve above-average results in multiple different areas. The characteristics of gifted pupils which distinguish themselves from their ungifted peers are presented. Thesis also presents the impact of socio-cultural environment, which has a significant influence on the development of talent. If a child grows up in an unfavourable environment, the prospects for the development of his abilities are poor in spite of <b>hereditary</b> <b>dispositions.</b> In order to develop child's musical talent, early detection and work with talented pupil is important; not only by the parents, but also and especially by teachers in primary schools. Definition of a musical talent is presented, together with tests to determine the level of development of pupil’s musical abilities. The ways to recognize and promote the work of talented music pupils are presented in the context. In the empirical part of the research I identify the impact of socio-cultural environment on the development of musical talent of children. The study included 6 pupils from 4 th class, 23 pupils from 5 th class, 29 parents and 8 primary school teachers from one of the elementary schools in Gorenjska region. I used to explore different measurement instruments: tests of musical abilities for pupils of 4 th and 5 th class, a questionnaire for their parents and a questionnaire for primary school teachers. Survey has shown that the development of musical talent is greatly influenced by the socio-cultural environment and additional musical education of pupils (especially playing an instrument or music school attendance). Teachers do not apply any tests to identify musical talents; rather they discover gifted pupils with observation of their work and progress. Musically talented pupils are given the opportunity to participate in more complex tasks and are stimulated with various extra duties. The research has also shown that musically gifted pupils are not more motivated to perform musical activities in primary school than their peers which are not identified as musically gifted. ...|$|R

40|$|One {{fundamental}} question in biology is {{which are the}} processes {{that give rise to}} a differentiation between individuals, species and groups. Since the discovery of genes as the units of heredity, there has been a tendency to view genes as the determinants of the physical characteristics. It was W. Johannsen [1] who first proposed the distinction between genotype and phenotype by studying the heritable variation in plants. The <b>hereditary</b> <b>dispositions</b> of organisms was differentiated from the ways in which those dispositions have physical manifes- tation. The genotype-phenotype distinction was a conceptual framework from which studies of development, genetics and evolution achieved a new perspec- tive, being the next step the understanding of how is the mapping between these two differenciate spaces. The first section of this work contains a literature review of the main con- cepts that have been developed in time with the study of the genome and its expression and from which the genotype-phenotype mapping is considered nowa- days as a crucial framework wich picks up the complex mechanism by which individuals are developed [1 - 14]. It is also shown in the last part of this sec- tion actual genotype-phenotype mappings which resulting properties are going to be analyzed and compared in the third section [18, 19][21 - 23]. The second section shows a literature review of the concept of neutral evolution, which ex- plains the invariance of phenotype behind multiple point mutations, and how from this mechanism which is observed in actual organisms along evolution is possible the punctuacted equilibria phenomenon. Behind this concept of evo- lution scientific community is constructing neutral networks, which are defined from the genotype-phenotype mappings, and studying some properties of these networks having a biological interpretation [15 - 17]. This section also shows dif- ferent constructions of neutral networks arising from genotype-phenotype map- pings defined in the first section. Note that most of the models analyzed are based on RNA folding. The third section shows network properties of genotype- phenotype mappings of the different models which are defined in the lastest sec- tions and are compared to each other. The fourth section explains a new model based on a cellular automata. This model is thougth to be appropiate because of its originality and mathematical nature. Some measures that have been used in previous models are applied over the new model in order to compare the resulting biological properties. For finalyzing the work, a new measure is de- veloped and applied to the model to obtain interesting biological interpretations. The main goal of this work is to compare different models of neutral net- works to a new one based on a cellular automaton. From this comparison, we can elucidate that from a very simple and abstract model it is possible to ob- tain similar results to very much complicated models based on RNA folding or protein function. As a second goal, biological properties such as robust- ness, evolvability and accesibility are studied to get an intuitive idea about how evolution operates behind neutral mutations.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2015. Major: Chemistry. Advisor: Theresa Reineke. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xxiii, 270 pages. Polymers - large macromolecules composed from many smaller subunits - have ever-growing uses and potentials in our lives. More specifically, cationically charged polymers {{have been widely}} explored as non-viral vectors to deliver nucleic acid to cells {{in an effort to}} regulate gene and protein expression. The polymeric vehicle must not only bind and complex with DNA to protect and deliver it to the targeted site, but also efficiently dissociate from the DNA and be non-toxic to the cell or host organism. Herein lies the wide array of polymers that must be rationally designed and synthesized in order for the delivery vehicle to perform its specific function. At the turn of the century, two monumental achievements paved way for gene therapy. First, the Human Genome Project was completed. This milestone continues to unravel important information about the genetic basis of human health, disease, <b>hereditary,</b> and genetic <b>dispositions.</b> Second, RNA interference was discovered, an innate cellular pathway to control gene expression within cells. These discoveries afforded scientists the information necessary to move forward with controlling gene and protein expression profiles. More recently, CRISPR-cas technology was discovered, which allows scientists to permanently edit the genetic code by either regulating genes or adding, disrupting, deleting, or altering the specific base-pairs within the DNA sequence. Herein, we investigate several classes of polymers and macromolecules for the complexation and delivery of nucleic acid, including: amino acids, dendrimers, micelles, and linear homo- and block polymers. Initially, it was shown that polymer type, length, charge, dispersity, and composition greatly affect the efficacy of these therapeutic delivery vehicles. With this in consideration we set out to explore some of the fundamental properties of polymeric vectors. Diblocks, triblocks, and statistical copolymers were designed and synthesized with varying amounts of primary and tertiary amines. These were complexed with pDNA to from polyplexes and probed for their toxicity, stability, gene expression profiles, and mechanisms of membrane permeability. Amphiphilic polymers were also synthesized, which in aqueous environments spontaneously self assembled into core-shell structured micelles. These were probed for their ability to change size in different buffers and form different sized aggregates with DNA...|$|R

40|$|Selection of {{significant}} genes via expression patterns {{is an important}} problem in microarray experiments. Owing to small sample size and {{the large number of}} variables (genes), the selection process can be unstable. This paper proposes a hierarchical Bayesian model for gene (variable) selection.

The recurrent headache can be understood as being a heterogeneous state, consisting of some more, still not found, <b>hereditary</b> <b>disposition</b> factors which altogether, interacting with surrounding factors give the recognizable clinical picture. The current heredity concept suggests multifactor heredity. The research was conducted in Vojvodina, the Northern Province of Serbia. The population of Vojvodina is around 2 million people belonging to more than 20 different ethnic groups. During the 20 years period (1988 - 2008), 30363 children aged 3 to 17 years were tested, independent of the place of birth. The presence of headaches similar to those tested was compared among {{all the members of the}} family within three generations. Positive family data of the recurrent headaches was detected among 98, 6 % children with migraine headaches, 64, 7 % children with non- migraine headaches, and 32, 4 % children without recurrent headaches.

A review on literatures of prostatic cancer epidemiology (Dr. Mishina). The review revealed evidences as follows: Two striking evidences in prostatic cancer epidemiology are prevalence only in older ages and different incidence between races. The highest frequency is observed among Negros living in U. S. and relatively higher among Whites commonly in U. S. and Europe. On the contrary, most Orientals show lower frequency, though that among Japanese is increasing remarkably during these one or two decades. Some migrant studies reveal that frequency among Japanese Americans is approximately in the middle between Japanese in Japan and American Whites. Although the occurrence of latent cancer is almost equal in each race, histological features of the cancer cells are more active in Whites or Japanese Americans than Japanese in Japan. Two probable evidences are influence from sexual life and heredity. This disease is fewer in unmarried men than married men and prevalent in men with greater sexual activities.

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{association}} between life events, family history of mammary carcinoma and breast cancer. It was guided by a model consisting of events, family disposition and age {{at the side of}} the independent variables. In addition to these factors 'lack of social support' was introduced. The latter is conceptualized as a vulnerability factor capable of aggravating the impact of events without having an independent effect. There was no hypothesis on chronic difficulties, so this is exploratory. This research was conducted as a so-called 'limited prospective' design. Women with a suspicious breast lump were interviewed before surgery. After having confirmed the outcome of the surgery the sample was divided into a group with cancer and cases with a benign diagnosis. Women with gall stones were introduced as another control group. The interviews were performed along a semi-structured schedule, tape recorded and analyzed by using Brown and Harris' Life Events and Difficulties Scale. The analyses were made with 33 women with cancer, 59 with a benign tumor and 20 with gall stones. In the 'malignant' group the severest events was four times as high as in controls. All other degrees of threat were equally distributed over the groups. Chronic difficulties of the highest degree of severity also occur more often in the cancer group. They are not independent from events so that analyzing them separately is not useful. The rate of family history of breast cancer does not differ between the tumor groups, but is much lower in the gall stone patients. In the cancer group there is an association between this possibly hereditary factor and severe events, in the 'benign' group both are uncorrelated. The life event effect is explained in context of a higher illness susceptibility due to a <b>hereditary</b> <b>disposition.</b> For events occurring without it an explanation remains unclear. life events chronic difficulties breast cancer family history of breast cancer...|$|E
40|$|Japanese cedar pollinosis (JCPsis) {{is a major}} {{national}} health problem in Japan. The present review provides an update on information on JCPsis based on clinical data from our research group, through {{the support of the}} Department of Health and Welfare (Japanese Government), during the period from 1988 to 1997, because this disease is infrequently documented internationally despite a large number of publications from Japan. The information on JCPsis presented here may be of use in the management of various kinds of pollinosis prevalent in other countries. The prevalence rates of JCPsis vary from district to district and also depend on the age of the subjects, the method of analysis and the year of examination in population. Yet, on an average, the incidence of JCPsis is presumed to be 10 - 20 % in adults and 5 - 10 % in children. The risk factors for sensitization and the onset of symptoms seem to be dependent on the amount of air-borne pollen, the age of school children, <b>hereditary</b> <b>disposition,</b> including human leukocyte antigen type and the high levels of specific IgE in childhood. Because pollen counts also vary depending on many factors, such as the type of pollen samplers used, yearly variations, the number of pollen count stations, the atmospheric temperature and solar radiation in the previous year of the season, accurate predictions of daily and seasonal pollen counts are rather difficult. Commercial crude extracts and purified allergenic substances Cry j I and II correlate well with the skin test and the radioallergosorbent test. Japanese cedar pollen has an allergenic component that is cross-reactive with Japanese cypress. In many patients, the onset of symptoms occurs on the day when the air-borne pollen count is 10 /cm 2 (the Durham method) and, if severe symptoms occur due to intense exposure to pollen, the symptoms will last for a long time despite variations in the pollen count (priming effect). Eye glasses, face masks and keeping windows and doors of the house closed are useful measures for pollen avoidance. Symptom control during the season is not difficult by the continuous use of new anti-allergic drugs during the season. If medication is started 1 – 2 weeks prior to the onset of the season, more satisfactory results can be obtained. Specific immunotherapy can not only control symptoms, but can reduce the amount of medication and, after completion of the regimen, long- term remission without medication can be expected...|$|E
40|$|Selection of signi?cant genes via {{expression}} patterns {{is important}} in a microarray problem. Owing to small sample size and large number of variables (genes), the selection process can be unstable. This research proposes a hierarchical Bayesian model for gene (variable) selection. We employ latent variables in a regression setting and use a Bayesian mixture prior to perform the variable selection. Due to the binary nature of the data, the posterior distributions of the parameters are not in explicit form, {{and we need to}} use a combination of truncated sampling and Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based computation techniques to simulate the posterior distributions. The Bayesian model is ?exible enough to identify the signi?cant genes as well as to perform future predictions. The method is applied to cancer classi?cation via cDNA microarrays. In particular, the genes BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 are associated with a <b>hereditary</b> <b>disposition</b> to breast cancer, and the method is used to identify the set of signi?cant genes to classify BRCA 1 and others. Microarray data can also be applied to survival models. We address the issue of how to reduce the dimension in building model by selecting signi?cant genes as well as assessing the estimated survival curves. Additionally, we consider the wellknown Weibull regression and semiparametric proportional hazards (PH) models for survival analysis. With microarray data, we need to consider the case where the number of covariates p exceeds the number of samples n. Speci?cally, for a given vector of response values, which are times to event (death or censored times) and p gene expressions (covariates), we address the issue of how to reduce the dimension by selecting the responsible genes, which are controlling the survival time. This approach enables us to estimate the survival curve when n << p. In our approach, rather than ?xing the number of selected genes, we will assign a prior distribution to this number. The approach creates additional ?exibility by allowing the imposition of constraints, such as bounding the dimension via a prior, which in e?ect works as a penalty. To implement our methodology, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) method. We demonstrate the use of the methodology with (a) di?use large B??cell lymphoma (DLBCL) complementary DNA (cDNA) data and (b) Breast Carcinoma data. Lastly, we propose a mixture of Dirichlet process models using discrete wavelet transform for a curve clustering. In order to characterize these time??course gene expresssions, we consider them as trajectory functions of time and gene??speci?c parameters and obtain their wavelet coe?cients by a discrete wavelet transform. We then build cluster curves using a mixture of Dirichlet process priors...|$|E
40|$|Diagnosis code C 50 {{represents}} {{malignant neoplasm}} of breast. It {{is the most}} frequent tumour disease in women. In 2009, 5975 cases were newly diagnosed in women in the Czech Republic and 1607 women died of this disease. There exist many risk factors which can cause tumour such as <b>hereditary</b> <b>disposition,</b> age, menses, menopause and other factors. At the same time, we can influence many factors and so prevent the disease. Prevention is also important, whether {{in the form of}} self - investigation of breast or mammography screening, which is recoverable by insurance from the age of 45. Treatment of breast carcinoma includes a lot of medical modalities such as surgical, hormonal and biological treatment, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. This thesis deals in more details with radiotherapy which is irreplaceable in treatment of this disease. Radiotherapy is a treatment of malignant and benign tumours by means of ionising radiation. In order to treat patients with radiotherapy, a team of doctors and radiologists shall create an individual radiation plan for them including the exact target volume, critical organs, radiation technology, fractionation and particular radiation exposure, radiation position and many other data necessary to accurate irradiation. A technology of two tangential fields is the most applied technology at breast cancer treatment. This technology is also applied in Nemocnice České Budějovice a. s. where I have created a file of 60 patients with breast carcinoma treated on oncology department in the year 2011. There have been used 536 verification images on the whole, it means 1608 evaluation. In course of treatment a patient should have an identical radiation position, which is reached with irradiation and fixation aids. However, from various reasons small or bigger deviations from the optimal position happen and therefore a possibility of irradiation of another volume than the required target one can occur. It is necessary {{to be aware of the}} fact that during a treatment of oncology patients there can often appear change of weight, change of body shape of a patient and at advanced stages even also change of physical state and movability of a patient. Therefore large deviations can happen in patients with breast carcinoma namely for example in case of breast deformation or abnormal loss of weight due to the treatment. In Nemocnice České Budějovice a. s., the maximum allowed deviation for vertical, lateral and longitudinal axis is stated 0, 7 cm and for rotation 3 °. I have noticed the acquired deviation values from verification images into a chart and consequently into a figure where are shown the average deviations and frequencies of these deviation in particular axes for each radiation field. The biggest deviation has happened in vertical axis and the average deviation in that axis was 0, 29 cm. The maximum allowed deviation was exceeded only at 3 %, so at 45 deviation from the total evaluation. This thesis should prove the fact that verification images enable to prevent possible errors during radiotherapy. This hypothesis has been confirmed because only 3 % evaluation exceeded the maximum allowed deviations. Verification images enable us to disclose wrong irradiation position, therefore only the target volume is irradiated and follows no irradiation of the surrounding healthy tissue and critical organs...|$|E
