5|$|Beetles have {{a variety}} of ways to communicate, {{including}} the use of pheromones. The mountain pine beetle emits a pheromone to attract other beetles to a tree. The mass of beetles are able to overcome the chemical <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> the tree. After the tree's defenses have been exhausted, the beetles emit an anti-aggregation pheromone. The species can stridulate to communicate.|$|E

5|$|Fort Corcoran was a wood-and-earthwork {{fortification}} {{constructed by}} the Union Army in northern Virginia {{as part of the}} <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> Washington, D.C. during the American Civil War. Built in 1861, shortly after the occupation of Arlington, Virginia by Union forces, it protected {{the southern end of the}} Aqueduct Bridge and overlooked the Potomac River and Theodore Roosevelt Island, known as Mason's Island.|$|E

5|$|Lasker's match {{record was}} as {{impressive}} between his 1896–97 re-match with Steinitz and 1914: he won {{all but one}} of his normal matches, and three of those were convincing <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> his title. He first faced Marshall in the World Chess Championship 1907, when despite his aggressive style, Marshall could not win a single game, losing eight and drawing seven (final score: 11½−3½).|$|E
5|$|Navarro, for his part, {{pressured}} by Madero, {{tried to keep}} the ceasefire {{for as long as he}} could. This proved to be quite costly to the defenders. The rebel forces captured the outer <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> the city unopposed, as no federal officer was willing to countermand the orders to hold fire. Instead, the troops withdrew deeper into the city.|$|E
5|$|With rising {{tensions}} Shirley {{acted to}} strengthen the military <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> the colony. He created a series of volunteer militia companies along the frontier.

5|$|After the {{surrender}} of General Robert E. Lee's Army of Northern Virginia on April 9, 1865, {{the primary reason for}} manned defenses protecting Washington ceased to exist. Initial recommendations by Colonel Barton S. Alexander, then-chief engineer of the Washington defenses, were to divide the defenses into three classes: those that should be kept active (first-class), those that should be mothballed and kept in a reserve state (second-class), and those that should be abandoned entirely (third-class). Due to its rear-area nature {{and the fact that the}} fort was unimportant to the overall <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> Washington, Fort Runyon fell into the third-class category.|$|E
5|$|As {{was common}} for many senior {{officers}} {{at the end of}} the war, Alexander was honored with a brevet rank of brigadier general in the regular army, effective March 13, 1865. Following his closure of the offices of the <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> Washington, D.C., he was briefly ordered to New England, where he supervised the renovation of various minor fortifications and river improvements in Maine. That posting came to an end on January 7, 1867, when he was ordered to the West Coast as the chief U.S. Army engineer in the region. He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on March 7, 1867.|$|E

5|$|Beauregard {{continued}} {{commanding the}} <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> Petersburg {{in the early}} days of the siege, but with the loss of the Weldon Railroad in the Battle of Globe Tavern (August 18–21), he was criticized for not attacking more forcefully and he became dissatisfied with the command arrangements under Lee. He hoped for an independent command, but his desires were thwarted in two instances: Lee chose Lt. Gen. Jubal Early to lead an expedition north through the Shenandoah Valley and threaten Washington, and Davis chose Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood to replace the faltering Joseph E. Johnston in the Atlanta Campaign.|$|E
5|$|By 22 May Chacal was {{reassigned to}} the 2nd DCT when the unit was tasked to carry {{demolition}} teams to the northernmost French ports; the ship arrived at Calais that evening. Together with Léopard and eight smaller destroyers, Chacal bombarded advancing German troops {{as they approached}} the <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> Boulogne-sur-Mer throughout the 23rd. During the night of 23–24 May, the ship was badly damaged by bombs from Heinkel He 111 bombers and shells from German artillery and had to be beached between Ambleteuse and Wimereux lest she sink.|$|E
5|$|Caliph Abu Bakr died in Madinah, making Umar his successor. Umar removed Khalid from {{command of}} the Muslim army and {{appointed}} Abu Ubaidah as the new commander in chief. In later years, following the Battle of Yarmuk, the Rashidun Caliphate annexed the whole Levant, followed by the conquest of Antioch in 638. By 639, the Byzantines had lost Armenia and Mesopotamia. Emperor Heraclius concentrated on the <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> Egypt and Anatolia, creating a buffer-zone in Anatolia west of Caesarea by abandoning all the Byzantine fortifications there. The Muslims never invaded Anatolia. However, by 642 the Byzantines lost Egypt and Tripolitania to the Caliphate.|$|E

5|$|During the American Civil War, {{he served}} as an advisor to the Engineering Brigade of the Army of the Potomac and became chief {{engineer}} of the <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> Washington, D.C.

He died on December 15, 1878, in San Francisco, California.|$|E
5|$|During this time, Vandegrift {{continued}} to direct efforts to strengthen {{and improve the}} <b>defenses</b> <b>of</b> the Lunga perimeter. Between 21 August and 3 September, he relocated three Marine battalions—including the 1st Raider Battalion, under U.S. Lieutenant Colonel Merritt A. Edson (Edson's Raiders), and the 1st Parachute Battalion—from Tulagi and Gavutu to Guadalcanal. These units added about 1,500 troops to Vandegrift's original 11,000 men defending Henderson Field. The 1st Parachute battalion, which had suffered heavy casualties in the Battle of Tulagi and Gavutu-Tanambogo in August, was placed under Edson's command.|$|E
