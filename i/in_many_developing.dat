5|$|<b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>developing</b> countries, the {{ketogenic}} diet {{is expensive}} because dairy fats and meat {{are more expensive}} than grain, fruit and vegetables. The modified Atkins diet has been proposed as a lower-cost alternative for those countries; the slightly more expensive food bill can be offset by a reduction in pharmaceutical costs if the diet is successful. The modified Atkins diet is less complex to explain and prepare and requires less support from a dietitian.|$|E
5|$|Biomass {{for heat}} and {{power is a}} fully mature {{technology}} which offers a ready disposal mechanism for municipal, agricultural, and industrial organic wastes. However, the industry has remained relatively stagnant over the decade to 2007, even though demand for biomass (mostly wood) continues to grow <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>developing</b> countries. One {{of the problems of}} biomass is that material directly combusted in cook stoves produces pollutants, leading to severe health and environmental consequences, although improved cook stove programmes are alleviating some of these effects. First-generation biomass technologies can be economically competitive, but may still require deployment support to overcome public acceptance and small-scale issues.|$|E

5|$|Primary {{resistance}} {{occurs when}} a person becomes infected with a resistant strain of TB. A person with fully susceptible MTB may develop secondary (acquired) resistance during therapy because of inadequate treatment, not taking the prescribed regimen appropriately (lack of compliance), or using low-quality medication. Drug-resistant TB is a serious public health issue <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>developing</b> countries, as its treatment is longer and requires more expensive drugs. MDR-TB is defined as resistance to the two most effective first-line TB drugs: rifampicin and isoniazid. Extensively drug-resistant TB is also resistant to three {{or more of the}} six classes of second-line drugs. Totally drug-resistant TB is resistant to all currently used drugs. It was first observed in 2003 in Italy, but not widely reported until 2012, and has also been found in Iran and India. Bedaquiline is tentatively supported for use in multiple drug-resistant TB.|$|E
5|$|Although {{regulation}} reducing lead {{in products}} has greatly reduced exposure {{in the developed}} world since the 1970s, lead is still allowed in products <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>developing</b> countries. In all countries that have banned leaded gasoline, average blood lead levels have fallen sharply. However, some developing countries still allow leaded gasoline, which is the primary source of lead exposure in most developing countries. Beyond exposure from gasoline, the frequent use of pesticides in developing countries adds a risk of lead exposure and subsequent poisoning. Poor children in developing countries are at especially high risk for lead poisoning. Of North American children, 7% have blood lead levels above 10 μg/dL, whereas among Central and South American children, the percentage is 33 to 34%. About one fifth of the world's disease burden from lead poisoning occurs in the Western Pacific, and another fifth is in Southeast Asia.|$|E

25|$|Auto rickshaws carry {{people and}} goods <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>developing</b> countries. Also {{known as a}} three-wheeler, Samosa, tempo, tuk-tuk, trishaw, auto, rickshaw, autorick, bajaj, rick, tricycle, mototaxi, baby taxi or lapa in popular parlance, they are {{motorized}} version of the traditional pulled rickshaw or cycle rickshaw. They are an essential form of urban transport, both as vehicles for hire and for private use, <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>developing</b> countries, and a form of novelty transport in many Eastern countries.|$|E
25|$|The community-led total {{sanitation}} campaigns {{which have}} been successful <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>developing</b> countries usually also result {{in the construction of}} pit latrines (typically with pour flush in Asia, without pour flush in sub-Saharan Africa) as a first step to get away from open defecation.|$|E

50|$|The {{distribution}} of wealth among the Nepali is consistent with that <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>developed</b> and developing countries: the highest 10% of households control 39.1% of the national wealth and the lowest 10% control only 2.6%.|$|R
25|$|Renewable energy {{projects}} <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>developing</b> {{countries have}} demonstrated that renewable energy can directly contribute to poverty alleviation by providing the energy needed for creating businesses and employment.

25|$|Plant-parasitic {{nematodes}} cause {{significant economic}} losses {{to a wide}} variety of crops. Chemical control is a widely used option for plant-parasitic nematode management. However, chemical nematicides are now being reappraised in respect of environmental hazard, high costs, limited availability <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>developing</b> countries or their diminished effectiveness following repeated applications.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>many</b> <b>developing</b> {{countries}} such as India, sales tax/VAT are key revenue sources as high unemployment and low per capita income render other income sources inadequate. However, there is strong opposition to this by many sub-national governments as it leads to an overall reduction in the revenue they collect {{as well as of}} some autonomy.|$|E

50|$|Dog licensing, {{euthanasia}} of stray dogs, muzzling, {{and other}} measures contributed to the elimination of rabies from the United Kingdom in the early 20th century.

25|$|According to {{researchers}} at the Overseas Development Institute, the lack of infrastructure <b>in</b> <b>many</b> <b>developing</b> countries {{represents one of the}} most significant limitations to economic growth and achievement of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Infrastructure investments and maintenance can be very expensive, especially in such areas as landlocked, rural and sparsely populated countries in Africa.|$|E
