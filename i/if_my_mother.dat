60|$|<b>If</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{suspected}} that I was anticipating marriage, and said nothing, Nancy Durrett suspected and spoke out.|$|E
60|$|Very well. But <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{insists on}} saying things, she must say them in Lady Frederick's presence.|$|E
6000|$|... "Dare, <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> throws Marg at that--slacker, I'll {{block the}} deal if it's {{the last thing}} I ever do," [...] he declared, violently.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Sorrah a bit!' {{returned}} Lanty, 'tho' 'tis {{a pretty}} place enough. <b>If</b> <b>my</b> old <b>mother</b> was here, 'tis her heart would {{warm to the}} mountains.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, madam. I {{give you}} my solemn word as a Queen's {{daughter}} that I will never wed, save by your consent, <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> life be granted. The King of Scots knows not {{that there is such}} a being. He need never know it. I will thank and bless you whether you throw me into the Tower, or let me abide as the humblest of your serving-women, under the name I have always borne, Cicely Talbot." ...|$|R
60|$|Yes, and again, {{as we walk}} home, I note some {{neighbours}} {{looking at}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and at me, and whispering. Again, as the three go on arm-in-arm, and I linger behind alone, I follow some of those looks, and wonder <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> step be really not so light as I have seen it, and if the gaiety of her beauty be really almost worried away. Again, I wonder whether any of the neighbours call to mind, as I do, how we used to walk home together, she and I; and I wonder stupidly about that, all the dreary dismal day.|$|R
6000|$|... "Willing? God forbid! I am simply {{amenable}} to force; <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> chooses to take me, I won't resist. I can't! I {{have come to}} that!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shouldn't wonder. I know I {{should go}} mad <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{turned out to}} be {{somebody}} else's wife." [...] And then they both sauntered away.|$|E
6000|$|... "Darling," [...] he said, [...] "I am much happier. And <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> were {{reconciled}} {{to me and}} to you I should, I think, {{be happy}} quite." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I do. You {{are doing}} a noble, thankworthy thing. It is not only that I thank you for his sake, {{but it is a}} grand and {{beautiful}} deed in itself; and <b>if</b> <b>my</b> dear <b>mother</b> know, she is blessing you for it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then why do {{you want}} to have a fuss, and a bother, and a chatter? <b>If</b> <b>my</b> father and <b>mother</b> don't approve, they can telegraph.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "For <b>if</b> <b>my</b> {{father and}} <b>mother</b> got wit, And my bold brethren three, O mickle wad be the gude red blude, This day wad be spilt for me! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am not an}} {{independent}} being. <b>If</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and Mr. Wright were to agree together to put me out of harm's way they could easily manage it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall find it, if ever I find it, in yours," [...] she interrupted. [...] "And {{what shall}} you do <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> will not consent to our engagement?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sure. Meet you here. I {{just wanted}} to unload on you, Dare. Looks as <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> has hatched it up between Margie and our esteemed countryman, Richard Swann." ...|$|E
60|$|If I {{had been}} {{round the world}} since we parted, we {{could hardly have been}} better pleased to meet again. My aunt cried {{outright}} as she embraced me; and said, pretending to laugh, that <b>if</b> <b>my</b> poor <b>mother</b> had been alive, that silly little creature would have shed tears, she had no doubt.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Valeria, <b>if</b> you {{understood}} <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{as well as}} I do, {{a serious}} explanation of her conduct {{would be the last}} thing in the world that you would expect from me. The idea of taking <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> seriously!" [...] He burst out laughing again. [...] "My darling, you don't know how you amuse me." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>If</b> your <b>mother,</b> <b>my</b> dear Amadis, had not fancied {{your father}} better than somebody, {{you might have}} been that somebody's son. Consider this. Always be a philosopher, even about women.|$|R
6000|$|... "You term {{marriage}} miserable, I suppose, {{from what}} you saw of my father and mother's. <b>If</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> suffered what I suffered when I was with papa, she {{must have had a}} dreadful life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed, Laura,' said Philip, with a smile, 'I am equally {{far from}} {{guessing}} what I should do <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> had {{been anything but}} what she was, as from guessing what I should do if I had a talent for music.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, Peters, <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> presses you as {{to whether}} any news has been {{received}} from Vordwyk, you must tell the truth; but {{if it can be}} concealed from her it will be much the best. She will have anxiety enough concerning my father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do I {{know any}} destroyer-lootenants?" [...] said he. [...] "This coast's rank with 'em! Destroyer-lootenants are born stealing. It's a mercy they's {{too busy to}} {{practise}} forgery, or I'd be in gaol. Engineer-Commanders? Engineer-Lootenants? They're worse!... Look here! <b>If</b> <b>my</b> own <b>mother</b> was {{to come to me}} beggin' brass screws for her own coffin, I'd--I'd think twice before I'd oblige the old lady. War's war, I grant you that; but what I've got to contend with is crime." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{my little}} mother," [...] said Paul with loving pride. [...] "I got Grandma to hang it there where I'd {{see it as}} soon as I opened my eyes in the morning. I never mind not having the light when I go to bed now, because it just seems as <b>if</b> <b>my</b> little <b>mother</b> was right here with me. Father knew just what I would like for a {{birthday}} present, although he never asked me. Isn't it wonderful how much fathers DO know?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All the time," [...] she answered, fervently, [...] "I am {{praying that}} he may. <b>If</b> he treated <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> badly, I {{am sure that}} he has suffered. I can't quite forget, either," [...] she went on, [...] "although that seems selfish, that when I {{come out of the}} hospital, even if all goes well, I may still be homeless." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And, <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> trains her up," [...] said Ebbo, thoughtfully, [...] "she {{will be all}} {{the better}} {{daughter}} to her. But, Sir Cousin, you know I too must be going. So soon as I can brook the saddle, I must seek out and ransom my father." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> {{will let}} me,' {{answered}} the boy. And the king bade the servant {{go back to}} the mother and say that if she would give her boy to him, he should live in the palace and marry his prettiest daughter {{as soon as he was}} a man.|$|E
60|$|This {{finished}} my {{opposition to the}} swallow-tail coat. <b>If</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> {{the daughter of a}} pioneer, a woman of the farm, accepted it as something appropriate to her son, its ultimate acceptance by all America was inevitable. Thereafter I lay in wait for an opportunity to display myself in all my London finery.|$|E
6000|$|... "But," [...] he added, [...] "my {{marriage}} {{is becoming a}} necessity, <b>if</b> only for <b>my</b> <b>mother's</b> sake; and you stand far before any other woman with me, if that would but satisfy you. I verily believe that {{in a short time}} we should be just as comfortable together as if we could start with more romance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As {{it is not}} far and {{you have}} that big basket, I'll go with you and help carry the things, <b>if</b> I may? <b>My</b> <b>mother</b> will let me, and my father will come and see you, I'm sure, if you'd like to have him. He takes care of everybody, and is the best and wisest man in all the world." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{the people}} in the villages, so far as I could detect, saw no {{difference}} in their world. Two little girls bobbed and an old labourer touched his hat convulsively as I walked through the village. He still thought he knew his place--and mine. I did not know him, but I would have liked dearly to have asked him <b>if</b> he remembered <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> <b>if</b> either <b>my</b> uncle or old Lichtenstein had been man enough to stand being given away like that.|$|R
6000|$|She {{coloured}} and {{hesitated for}} some moments, and then returned, [...] "I cannot tell you that. <b>If</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> was the Margaret Affleck you advertised for, and something {{has been left}} to her, or some relation wishes to trace her, {{it is too late}} now. She is dead, and it is nothing to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For my part," [...] remarked a third Yip, [...] "I {{would rather}} {{go back home}} and dig and polish some more {{diamonds}} and mine some more gold and make you another dishpan than be scratched from head to heel by these dreadful bushes. Even now, <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> saw me, she would not know I am her son." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go home; tell my mother--all the world--that Christina Sorel is my wife, wedded on the Friedmund Wake by Friar Peter of Offingen, and if {{she should}} bear a child, he is my true and lawful heir. My sword for him--my love to her. And <b>if</b> <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> would not be haunted by me, let her take care of her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I will try," [...] {{returned}} Hester, {{attempting to}} smile. [...] "But {{it is not}} that I am discontented with my lot, for they are as kind to me here as <b>if</b> they were <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> and sister, and I like doing the embroidery work very much--it's not that. It is the weary waiting, and hoping for, and expecting news of my darling father--news which never comes." ...|$|R
5000|$|The murders made {{headlines}} in New York {{and the city}} went into an uproar. Agron was called [...] "The Capeman" [...] because he wore a black cape with red lining during the fight, while Hernandez was labeled [...] "The Umbrella Man" [...] because he used an umbrella with a sharp end as a weapon. After Agron was captured, he was quoted as saying: [...] "I don't care <b>if</b> I burn, <b>my</b> <b>mother</b> could watch me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know, mother; I {{have not}} been able to think about it. I should not think he could. I know if it had been me I should have hated her even <b>if</b> she was <b>my</b> <b>mother,</b> for coming after all this time to rob me of your love and father's. I should run away as he has done, I daresay, though I don't know about that; but I would not have gone with her." ...|$|R
