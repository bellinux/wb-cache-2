40|$|Data on {{the film}} cooling {{performance}} of several liner cooling devices are obtained over the range of velocity and density ratios relevant to gas turbines. Among the devices with tangential injection, the wiggle strip device and the machined ring with skirt construction provide the 13; most effective film cooling. The addition of a skirt to the wiggle strip may improve its performance in the lower velocity range. The lowest effectiveness was obtained with the splash cooling arrangement which gives effective cooling of the slot lip {{at the expense of}} downstream performance. Of the discrete hole injection devices tested, 13; the <b>dimpled</b> <b>hole</b> construction gives a significantly better performance than normal injection over a wide range of velocity ratios...|$|E
30|$|The Cr {{layer is}} used as an {{adhesion}} layer for Au which is washed out later. The fabrication process is followed by 0.7  μm SiO 2 PECVD deposition at 250  ° C as dielectric. A 30  nm TiW is used at this step as an adhesion layer between D 2 and G 1. In step five a 2.5  μm thick spin coated polyimide layer {{is used as}} a sacrificial layer. To create the anchor and the <b>dimple</b> <b>holes,</b> polyimide is patterned using RIE. Then the fabrication process is completed by sputtering the 70  nm Au as a seed layer and an electroplated Au layer with total thickness of 2  μm and removing the sacrificial layer using O 2 plasma dry etching in RIE.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} an experimental evaluation {{pertaining to the}} influence of steel self-tapping screw on its twisting-in specimens made of various materials and its twisting-out process. Main principles of the investigation methodology including description of  technological scheme of self-tapping screw electro-arc machining and specimens applied while executing the experiments and hardware measuring tools used for fixation of torque which has been applied to the self-tapping screw during its twisting-in in the specimen  and its twisting-out process have been presented in the paper. It has been established that the self-tapping screw electro-arc machining initiates formation of <b>dimples</b> (<b>holes)</b> which have solidified metal flows along their edges. The flows give a cutting ability to the screw and so they exert an influence on the conditions of screw’s interaction with the specimen during its twisting-in and twisting-out processes. The paper presents results of experimental investigations that demonstrate an impact of self-tapping screw electro-arc machining on its twisting-in in the specimens made of various materials and twisting-out procedure. In particular, it has been ascertained that torque value applied to the self-tapping screw with modified surface during twisting-in process is less in comparison with the self-tapping screw having an initial state of its surface {{and in the case of}} its twisting-out process the value is higher. In this respect difference between the indicated torque values is increasing when material hardness of the specimen becomes higher.   </p...|$|R
40|$|Using the {{experimental}} and theoretical approach both heat transfer and gas-dynamics of two complex vortex and swirling flows {{have been studied}} in details. New regularities regarding the local and average heat transfer have been established in the cylindrical channel with initial tangentially-inclined flow swirl at the stationary conditions, {{as well as in}} the radial rotating channel. The new similarity correlations have been obtained for the different boundary conditions arranged at the channel exit. The turbulence model has been determined, describing adequately both the thermal and gas-dynamic parameters, the Coriolis force influence on heat transfer in the radial rotating cylindrical channel with flow swirl has been studied. The heat transfer and gas-dynamic calculation procedure has been developed. The novel approach has been studied of the heat transfer control along the channel axial length with tangentially-inclined flow swirl. New heat transfer and gas-dynamic regularities over the flat plate at the secondary flow supply into single- and dual rows of discrete hemispherical <b>dimples</b> and twin <b>holes</b> at the inlet have been established. New scientific results characterizing the thermal effectiveness of the flat plate have been obtained at the external turbulence and flow acceleration conditions. The basic similarity correlations are given for the heat transfer effectiveness, as well as for correction functions, characterizing effect of external turbulence and flow acceleration; the span-wise heat transfer non-uniformity has been identified. The turbulence models describing adequately heat transfer and gas-dynamic have been justified, the physical features defining heat transfer effectiveness have been revealed for the conditions studied. The suggestions are given for the calculation procedures on the heat transfer effectiveness. ???????????????? ? ???????????? ??????????? ?????????? ? ???????????? ???? ????? ??????? ???????? ? ??????????? ???????. ? ?????????????? ?????? ? ?????????????-????????? ????????? ?????? ?? ????? ??? ???????????? ??????? ? ??? ?????????? ???????? ?????? ??????????? ????? ?????????????? ?????????? ? ???????? ???????????, ???????? ????????? ??????? ??? ????????? ????????? ??????? ?? ??????. ?????????? ?????? ??????????????, ????????? ??????????? ???????? ? ???????????????? ????????, ??????? ??????? ???? ????????? ?? ?????????? ? ????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ?????? ? ????????? ??????. ??????????? ???????? ??????? ????????????? ??????????? ? ????????????. ?????? ????? ?????????? ??????????? ?? ????? ?????? ? ?????????????-????????? ????????? ??????. ??????????? ????? ?????????????? ??????????? ? ???????????? ????? ??????? ???????? ??? ?????? ?????????? ?????? ? ????- ? ?????????? ??????? ?????????? ??????????????? ?????????? ? ? ?????? ????????? ?? ?????. ???????? ????? ??????, ??????????????? ???????? ????????????? ??????? ??????????? ??? ????????? ??????? ? ?????????? ??????????????? ? ??????????. ???????????? ??????? ????????? ??????? ??? ????????????? ??????????? ? ??????????? ??????? ? ????, ??????????? ??????? ??????? ?????????????? ? ????????? ??????, ?????????? ?????????? ??????????????? ???????????. ?????????? ?????? ??????????????, ????????? ??????????? ?????????? ? ????????????, ???????? ?????????? ???????????, ???????????? ????????????? ??????????? ? ????????? ????????. ?????????????? ??????????? ? ????????? ??????? ????????????? ?????????? ??????????...|$|R
40|$|Mission {{critical}} {{applications of}} MEMS devices require {{knowledge of the}} distribution in their material properties and long-term reliability of the small-scale structures. This project reports on a new testing program at Sandia to quantify the strength distribution using samples that reflect the dimensions of critical MEMS components. The strength of polysilicon fabricated with Sandia's SUMMiT 4 -layer process was successfully measured using samples with gage sections 2. 5 {micro}m thick by 1. 7 {micro}m wide and lengths of 15 and 25 {micro}m. These tensile specimens have a freely moving pivot on one end that anchors the sample to the silicon die and prevents off axis loading during testing. Each sample is loaded in uniaxial tension by pulling laterally with a flat tipped diamond in a computer-controlled Nanoindenter. The stress-strain curve is calculated using the specimen cross section and gage length dimensions verified by measuring against a standard in the SEM. The first 48 samples had a means strength of 2. 24 {+-} 0. 35 GPa. Fracture strength measurements grouped into three strength levels, which matched three failure modes observed in post mortem examinations. The seven samples in the highest strength group failed in the gage section (strength of 2. 77 {+-} 0. 04 GPa), the moderate strength group failed at the gage section fillet and the lowest strength group failed at a dimple in the hub. With this technique, multiple tests can be programmed at one time and performed without operator assistance {{at a rate of}} 20 - 30 per day allowing the collection of significant populations of data. Since the new test geometry has been proven, the project is moving to test the distributions seen from real geometric features typical to MEMS such as the effect of gage length, fracture toughness, bonding between layers, etch <b>holes,</b> <b>dimples</b> and shear of gear teeth...|$|R
