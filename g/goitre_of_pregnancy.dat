40|$|BACKGROUND Multinodular goitre or nodular {{hyperplasia}} or adenomatoid goitre is {{the most}} common thyroid disease, which occurs due to deficient iodine intake. Initial hyperthyroid states, followed by follicular atrophy and secondary changes like haemorrhage, calcification and cystic degeneration occurs in most of the cases. Longstanding cases <b>of</b> nodular <b>goitre</b> can be associated with carcinomas, usually follicular carcinomas, and rarely papillary carcinomas. [1] This study was done to know the incidence of coexisting malignancies, follicular and papillary carcinomas of thyroid, in longstanding nodular <b>goitres</b> <b>of</b> thyroid. METHODS All the cases <b>of</b> nodular <b>goitres</b> examined {{in the last two years}} were studied, including the thyroidectomy specimens and FNAC slides whichever was done. Extensive grossing of the thyroidectomy specimens was done to detect the possibility of malignancy in longstanding cases <b>of</b> nodular <b>goitre</b> <b>of</b> thyroid. Review of FNAC slides was done in cases where cytodiagnosis of coexisting malignancy was missed and detected in histopathological examination. RESULTS In the present study, conducted over a two-year period, out of 50 cases of thyroidectomy specimens <b>of</b> multinodular <b>goitres</b> studied, six cases were diagnosed to be having coexisting malignancy of thyroid, of which four were follicular carcinomas of thyroid and two were papillary carcinomas of thyroid. FNAC diagnosis of coexisting malignancy was initially missed in FNAC in two cases, i. e. one case each of follicular carcinoma and papillary carcinoma. These FNAC slides were reviewed and the foci of malignancies detected. CONCLUSION There is a possibility of malignancy of thyroid coexisting with longstanding multinodular <b>goitre</b> <b>of</b> thyroid, which should be kept in mind, while performing the needle biopsy and thorough examination of FNAC slides is needed to avoid missing the possible detection of the coexisting malignant lesion. Thyroidectomy specimens should be extensively grossed to detect these coexisting lesions, and review of FNAC slides should be done whenever needed for correlation with histopathological findings. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction The {{specific}} dermatoses <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> represent heterogeneous {{group of}} pruritic skin disorders that occur exclusively in <b>pregnancy.</b> Specific Dermatoses <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> The updated classification proposed subdividing specific dermatoses <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> into four main categories: 1. atopic eruption of pregnancy; 2. polymorphic eruption of pregnancy; 3. pemphigoid gestationis; 4. intrahepatic cholestasis <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Severe pruritius, {{which is the}} main symptom in all 4 entities, can impair maternal quality of life. Significant maternal risks are not associated with specific dermatoses of pregnancy; however, pemphigoid gestationis and intrahepatic cholestasis <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> are associated with fetal risks. Conclusion Pathognomonic laboratory tests are not available, except direct immunofluorescence which is diagnostic of pemphigoid gestationis and elevated serum level of bile acids of intrahepatic cholestasis <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Characteristic clinical features provide discrimination between polymorphic eruption <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and atopic eruption <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{most recent}} {{reclassification}} <b>of</b> dermatoses <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> includes polymorphic eruption <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> atopic eruption <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> and pemphigoid gestationis; intrahepatic cholestasis <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> strictly not a dermatosis, {{was included in}} specific dermatoses <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> for working purposes.

40|$|The {{specific}} dermatoses <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> {{represent a}} heterogeneous group of pruritic skin diseases {{that have been}} recently reclassified and include pemphigoid (herpes) gestationis, polymorphic eruption <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> (syn. pruritic urticarial papules and plaques <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy),</b> intrahepatic cholestasis <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> and atopic eruption <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> They are associated with severe pruritus that should never be neglected in pregnancy but always lead to an exact work-up of the patient. Clinical characteristics, in particular timing of onset, morphology and localization of skin lesions are crucial for diagnosis which, in case of pemphigoid gestationis and intrahepatic cholestasis <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> will be confirmed by specific immunofluorescence and laboratory findings. While polymorphic and atopic eruptions <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> are distressing only to the mother because of pruritus, pemphigoid gestationis {{may be associated with}} prematurity and small-for-date babies and intrahepatic cholestasis <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> poses an increased risk for fetal distress, prematurity, and stillbirth. Corticosteroids and antihistamines control pemphigoid gestationis, polymorphic and atopic eruptions of pregnancy; intrahepatic cholestasis <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> in contrast, should be treated with ursodeoxycholic acid.

Materials and Methods: A descriptive study concerning 1077 pregnant women and failure <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy</b> including abortion and fetal death and its relationship with maternal age, paternal age, parity and previous abortion was carried out. Results: The prevalence <b>of</b> failure <b>of</b> <b>pregnancy,</b> abortion and fetal death was 13. 8, 11. 4 and 2. 4 respectively. High maternal age was the most prevalent factor involved with abortion (21. 8 with the age of 40 or older and 10 with age group of 20 - 30).
