5000|$|Their {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} large stretches of deciduous forest, especially with oaks, across eastern North America. They can occur, {{with varying degrees}} of success, in young successional woodlands and occasionally in extensive plantings of shade trees in suburban areas, parks, and cemeteries. For a viable breeding population, at least 10 to 12 hectares of forest are required. In winter, scarlet tanagers occur in the montane forest of the Andean foothills. Scarlet tanagers migrate to northwestern South America, passing through Central America around April, and again around October. They begin arriving in the breeding grounds in numbers by about May and already start to move south again in mid-summer; by early October they are all on their way south. The bird is an extremely rare vagrant to western Europe.Scarlet tanagers are often out of sight, foraging high in trees, sometimes flying out to catch insects in flight and then returning to the same general perch, in a hunting style known as [...] "sallying". Sometimes, however, they will also capture their prey on the forest floor. They eat mainly insects, and will opportunistically consume fruit when plentiful. Any flying variety of insect will readily be taken when common, such as bees, wasps, hornets, ants, and sawflies; moths and butterflies; beetles; flies; cicadas, leafhoppers, spittlebugs, treehoppers, plant lice, and scale insects; termites; grasshoppers and locusts; dragonflies; and dobsonflies. Scarlet tanagers also takes snails, earthworms and spiders. While summer tanagers are famous for this feeding method, when capturing bees, wasps and hornets, scarlet tanagers also rake the prey against a branch in order to remove their stingers before consumption. Plant components of their diet consists {{of a wide variety of}} fruits that eaten mainly when insects are at population lows including: blackberries (Rubus allegheniensis), raspberries (R. ideaus), huckleberries (Gaylussacia sp.), <b>juneberries</b> and serviceberries (Amelanchier spp.), mulberries (Morus rubra), strawberries (Fragaria virginiana), and chokeberries (Aronia melanocarpa).|$|R

40|$|Large {{ruminant}} herbivores like moose {{spend most}} of their time foraging and ruminating to acquire and process enough plant biomass to meet energy and nutrient requirements. In northeastern Minnesota, moose forage in a mosaic of forest stands with ages shaped by harvest and other disturbances. Distribution and abundance of browse species varies across the landscape and each browse species has unique growth patterns and a patchy distribution within and among different stand types. We measured browse availability and use along foraging paths of GPS radio-collared moose and within randomly selected regenerating stands in northeastern Minnesota. We measured all sites using traditional methods and a method that simulates moose foraging behavior by measuring large feeding stations. At each site we measured available species composition and available browse density. We tested three hypotheses: (1) the proportion of available browse species common in the diet along foraging paths would be greater than within randomly selected regenerating stands, (2) the density of available browse species would be greater along foraging paths than within randomly selected regenerating stands, and (3) the density of available twigs would be highest in young stands and decrease with stand age. Paper birch, willow, and quaking aspen were common in young stands while hazel, mountain maple, and balsam fir (winter) or <b>juneberry</b> (summer) were common in older stands. Browse density also changed with stand age, but the changes in species composition and browse density were similar along foraging paths and within randomly selected regenerating stands indicating that moose habitat restoration projects can effectively create forage for moose.

40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is {{the second}} most {{prevalent}} neurodegenerative disease with 5 % of the population being affected by age 85. The disease involves a loss of dopaminergic neurons from the substantia nigra in the midbrain, and this loss of neurons is largely responsible for motor symptoms such as the inability to initiate movement, resting tremor, and reduced balance. Molecular phenomena underlying neurodegeneration in PD include oxidative stress, loss of mitochondrial function, aggregation of the pre-synaptic protein alpha-synuclein (aSyn), and neuroinflammation. Current therapeutic strategies for PD only alleviate symptoms and do not reverse the neuronal death. Hence, patients and health care providers are in need of safe and effective neuroprotective therapies that can slow the neurodegenerative process. ^ Traditional medicine is the primary form of healthcare for 80 % of the population in developing countries. This form of medicine results from empirical determination of the safest and most efficient plant preparations to achieve desired health-promoting benefits. A number of in vitro and in vivo studies have led to the identification of polyphenols (including isoflavones and anthocyanins (ANC)) as a major class of plant-derived compounds with potential neuroprotective activities. As a result of these observations, we hypothesized that medicinal plants used in Nepalese and Native American traditional medicine to treat symptoms related to PD or other CNS disorders are potential neuroprotective candidates for the development of PD therapies. ^ The studies outlined in this thesis were aimed at identifying traditional herbal medicines used to treat PD and CNS-related disorders in (i) Nepalese communities living in three eco-geographical areas, and (ii) two Native American tribes (the Pikuni-Blackfeet and Lumbee tribes) with different cultural identities and traditional practices. Our ethnopharmacological study yielded insight into the strong influence of the surrounding environment on the practice of traditional medicine. In all three study areas, we observed and reported on the impact of cultural, historical and environmental pressures on the evolution of traditional medicine. ^ Our study led to the identification of medicinal plants across various botanical families with potential neuroprotective activities. We developed a primary screen to test the ability of 23 botanical extracts to activate Nrf 2, a transcription factor that acts as a master regulator of the cellular antioxidant response. Extracts that produced the most robust activation of Nrf 2 signaling were further studied to determine their neuroprotective effects against toxicity elicited by PD-related insults. The extracts of garlic, <b>juneberry,</b> elderflower, red clover, Mucuna pruriens and Tinospora sinensis alleviated neurodegeneration induced by the pesticide rotenone, the herbicide paraquat, and/or the A 53 T genetic mutant of aSyn. Following the observation that isoflavones-rich extracts (red clover) and ANC-rich berry extracts (<b>juneberry)</b> are potent neuroprotective agents, we carried out two studies aimed at understanding the beneficial role of isoflavones and ANC in PD models. In these studies we characterized several isoflavone-rich extracts, individual isoflavones, and ANC-rich extracts in terms of their ability to prevent dopaminergic cell loss, activate the Nrf 2 /ARE response, and alleviate mitochondrial dysfunction. We found that the extracts and compounds alleviated neurodegeneration by modulating different pro-survival pathways. The red clover and ANC-rich extracts, but not the soy extract or individual isoflavones, activated the Nrf 2 /ARE pathway. Interestingly, Nrf 2 activation mediated by ANC-rich extracts was ROS-dependent, whereas activation by the red clover extract was dependent on UPS inhibition. Furthermore, the red clover, soy, and ANC-rich extracts mitigated rotenone-induced mitochondrial impairment, and the amelioration of mitochondrial dysfunction by the red clover extract apparently involved the displacement of rotenone from its complex I binding site. Collectively, our data indicate that ethnopharmacological studies are an effective strategy to identify botanical specimens with neuroprotective activity. Polyphenol-rich herbal extracts achieve neuroprotection via multiple pro-survival mechanisms including activation of the Nrf 2 /ARE antioxidant response and maintenance of mitochondrial function. Our findings suggest that plant-based extracts with neuroprotective activity could potentially reduce the risk of PD and slow disease progression in patients. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a trend toward}} "edible {{landscaping}} " has begun to emerge as {{a natural extension of}} standard gardening. Two books on the subject have been published (Britz; Creasy), and in Massachu-setts a bill creating the innovative Massachusetts Fruition Program was passed by the legislature in 1980. With a budget of $ 64, 000 this program promotes the planting of food-producing trees, shrubs, and vines. Perhaps the most desirable characteristic in landscape plants is an ability to thrive in low-maintenance situations. This eliminates many commercial fruit species, however, as these usually have been highly selected for fruit production under the assumption that adequate care will be provided. Fortunately, there are many food-producing plants that, for various reasons, have never been developed. On the Arnold Arboretum grounds alone I found about 150 species, from Actinidia arguta to Zizyphus jujuba. The usual reason that such plants are not developed is that they have a deficiency in some characteristic, such as yield, keeping quality, or ease of propagation, that would limit their success as a commercial crop. On the other hand, their broader-based genetic makeup often allows them greater environmental adaptabil-ity, and they are therefore less needful of maintenance. I chose the two plants described here for the quality of their fruits and their adaptability in low-maintenance situations. Many other plants deserve equal attention, including the <b>juneberry,</b> flowering quince, hazelnut, walnut, mulberry, elderberry, hickory, pine nut, grape, and various Prunus species. Three major climatic factors must be considered in growing woody food plants in the Northeast: minimum winter temperatures, occur-rence of late spring and early fall freezes, and the relatively short, cool growing season. Carefully choosing a favorable planting site (e. g., with good air and soil drainage) will enhance a plant’s performance in any given climate. Actinidia will grow reliably in northern New En-gland and New York (USDA plant hardiness zone 4; see map on page 119). The persimmon is recommended only for zones 5 and 6 in th...|$|E

Large ruminant herbivores like moose {{spend most of}} their time foraging and ruminating to acquire and process enough plant biomass to meet energy and nutrient requirements. In northeastern Minnesota, moose forage in a mosaic of forest stands with ages shaped by harvest and other disturbances. Distribution and abundance of browse species varies across the landscape and each browse species has unique growth patterns and a patchy distribution within and among different stand types. To estimate available and consumed biomass, we collected available twigs and created diameter-at-point-of-browsing-biomass regressions for each browse species. These relationships varied by canopy closure and were used to estimate biomass consumed on foraging paths. We also measured browse availability and use along foraging paths of GPS radio-collared moose and within randomly selected regenerating stands in northeastern Minnesota. We measured all sites using traditional methods and a method that simulates moose foraging behavior by measuring large feeding stations. We tested the hypotheses that (1) browse density is higher at large feeding stations than at random locations along a foraging path, (2) browse density is higher at large feeding stations than at randomly chosen feeding stations along a foraging path, and (3) browse density is higher at large feeding stations than along a straight transect. At each site we measured available species composition, available browse density, diet composition, and browse species selection. Combined with the use of GPS collars this method allowed us to compare the foraging path diet composition and browse selection of individual free-ranging moose. Paper birch, willow, and quaking aspen were common in young stands while hazel, mountain maple, and balsam fir (winter) or <b>juneberry</b> (summer) were common in older stands. Browse density also changed with stand age, but the changes in species composition and browse density were similar along foraging paths and within randomly selected regenerating stands indicating that moose habitat restoration projects can effectively create forage for moose. In areas with and without collared moose the simulated browsing method was an effective tool for measuring browse availability and use. We also provide evidence from the field that moose, and possibly other large herbivores, obtain most of their energy intake from small patches of high density browse...|$|E
