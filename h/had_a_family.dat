5|$|Eyre {{returned}} to Britain, arriving at Spithead on 10 December 1826, and was almost immediately offered command of a squadron fitting out for Lisbon. The changes in climate had brought on {{an attack of}} gout, and on being informed that as Sir Thomas Hardy's squadron {{was already on the}} spot, he was at liberty to refuse the offer. Eyre did so, and retired ashore. He appears to have had no further commands, and was advanced to vice-admiral in 1830. He had married Georgiana Cooke, the daughter of Sir George Cooke, 7th Baronet, at Doncaster on 1 November 1800, with whom he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> of eight children, including two sons named George-Hardolf and William. Sir George Eyre died on 15 February 1839 at the rectory, Carlton, Derbyshire.|$|E

25|$|Gervase Elwes, {{concert and}} oratorio singer, <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> home at Brigg Manor in Bigby Street, {{where he would}} {{sometimes}} reside. North Lincolnshire Music and Drama Festival was founded by Elwes and his wife Winifrede in 1900. They twice hosted their friend Percy Grainger, who collected a number of early folksongs at the festival. One of the singers, George Gouldthorpe (1839–1910), was an inmate of Brigg workhouse.|$|E
25|$|The {{calculation}} adjusts {{only for}} the 1,000 tombs found in Jerusalem instead of the whole Jewish populace that lived in the area. This effectively assumes that Jesus family in NT did indeed have a family tomb and it was among the 1000 tombs found in Jerusalem area. There is no historical evidence for this assumption. Some experts, including archaeologist Amos Kloner (the one who excavated the tombs) do not accept that the poor family from Nazareth <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> tomb in Jerusalem.|$|E

25|$|Potter's {{claims are}} questionable. The French {{were not in}} any {{position}} to receive Rogers, with a British governor sitting in Montreal. Nevertheless, {{on the strength of}} Potter's affidavit, Rogers was arrested in 1767, charged with treason, and taken to Montreal in chains for trial. This trial was postponed until 1768. Elizabeth, carrying their only child, went home to Portsmouth. This son became a lawyer in Portsmouth and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> that has descended to modern times.|$|E

He was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Cambridge, graduating with a law degree in 1932. He <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> connection with New Zealand, where he became Governor-General, through his great-grandfather George Lyttelton, 4th Baron Lyttelton, who {{was chairman of the}} Canterbury Association and contributed financially to the early development of Christchurch. Hagley Park is named after their family estate (Hagley Park, Worcestershire), and the port town of Lyttelton bears his great-grandfather's name. He visited New Zealand in 1950 in relation to property holdings in Christchurch.|$|E
25|$|Holt {{had been}} in {{reasonably}} good health throughout his life, although he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> history of premature death – his father had {{died at the age}} of 59 and his older brother at the age of 57. He suffered a severe concussion in a road accident in November 1955, in which the driver of his ministerial car was killed. In September 1967, Holt began treatment for a painful shoulder injury that he had originally suffered playing football in his youth; he was prescribed painkillers and twice-weekly physiotherapy. A few days before his death, he had been briefly examined by his personal physician, Marcus Faunce, who advised him to avoid over-exerting himself and to cut back on swimming and tennis.|$|E

25|$|Bolad {{also served}} as judge in the {{sensitive}} cases of Ariq Böke (1264) and the murder of Ahmad Fanakati (1282). Bolad found the fraud activities of the latter and informed the Khagan. He {{was sent to the}} Ilkhanate in Persia soon after Arghun enthroned in 1285. He gave imperial seal, jarlig (зарлиг) and crown to the new Ilkhan. Bolad could not return to the Yuan Dynasty due to the conflicts between the Yuan and the Chagatai Khanate headed by Kaidu. Arghun appointed him a commander of his kheshig and assigned him of certain tasks in Khurasan. Although he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> (his wife and two sons) left in Mongolia, Bolad was given a former concubine of Abaqa Khan, thus starting a new life in the Middle East. His sons served the Yuan government.|$|E
25|$|After {{recovering}} from a related infection, Orelli married and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> of six children. During World War II, despite his aversion to Nazi Germany and fascism, {{he was forced to}} work as an artillery director in Italy. At war's end, he returned to work as a mechanic, retiring in 1960. In his later years, he was active in urging others not to forget the lessons learned after the first World War, and in 2003 he was made a Grand Officer in the Order of Merit of the Italian Republic. He died in January 2005, a month after having turned 110 and achieving supercentenarian status. At the time of his death, he was Italy's oldest survivor of the First World War, the last remaining trench infantryman and the last survivor from Italy's entry into the war.|$|E
25|$|World War I badly {{affected}} his financial situation, and he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>family</b> {{to take care}} of, for in 1899 he had married Marguerite Carton de Wiart (1872–1939), and the children had come thick and fast, eight in all. He felt compelled to find a position, and in 1924 he was appointed director of the Municipal Conservatory of Bruges, a function that came with a teaching load. He assumed it with some reluctance, but he discovered that he enjoyed teaching, even “regret that I didn’t enter the teaching profession until I was 54.” He kept on composing, albeit at a slower rate. Also, he ceased composing oratorios, which he considered his major works, but that was {{at least as much}} due to the death of Charles Martens (1866–1921), his librettist as well as his Maecenas, the tireless propagandist of his music and above all his friend, whose name he never mentioned without preceding it with “my good friend” or similar expression.|$|E
