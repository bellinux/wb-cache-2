25|$|Nebraska and Miami {{are known}} for having a bitter bowl rivalry {{that dates back to}} the 1951 season when Nebraska lost the last game of their season to Miami. The most notable event of the rivalry is the 1984 Orange Bowl, in which Nebraska coach Tom Osborne <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> the {{two-point}} conversion instead of an extra point so Nebraska would have the lead and would not settle for a tie. It was unsuccessful, and Miami went on to beat Nebraska 31–30 for a national title.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} the 1958 season, Yorkshire having {{endured the}} least {{successful}} period in its history in terms of lack of County Championship success, the Yorkshire committee and new captain Ronnie Burnet <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> a policy of youth and dispensed with the services of several senior players, including Johnny Wardle, Bob Appleyard and Lowson. The move was a success in that Yorkshire won the Championship the following season, 1959, but Lowson went back to League cricket at the age of 33, and never played first-class cricket again. He went on to build a career in insurance.|$|E

25|$|The Public Roads Administration {{landed in}} 1992 at a bridge {{alternative}} as their preferred solution, backed among others by the Norwegian Haulier’s Association and Hurum Municipality. The former stated that a bridge {{would result in}} trucks consuming only half as much fuel on the segment, while the latter was also enacted {{by the prospect of}} the bridge becoming a tourist attraction. On the other hand, the bridge was met with protests from environmental organizations and residents of Drøbak and the ministry thus <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> a tunnel. A full-scale construction was debated, with two tubes and a new highway all the way to Lier.|$|E
25|$|Following {{two short}} running plays, Thomas threw a 16-yard pass to Coale {{for a first}} down. On the ensuing play, David Wilson ran 32 yards for a first down to Michigan's 24-yard line. Josh Ogelsby {{followed}} Wilson's run with an 11-yard run of his own. Ogelsby then rushed for five yards and one-yard respectively. Thomas followed these plays with a three-yard rush, setting up a fourth-and-one at the Michigan 4-yard line. Instead of kicking the field goal {{that would have given}} Tech a 9–0 lead, Frank Beamer <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> the first down. Thomas was stopped for no gain and Tech turned the ball over on downs.|$|E

Eventually facing fourth and 1 on the Houston 9-yard line, Steelers coach Chuck Noll <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> the first down.

Specifically shown was the level where Madison enters the Blue Lagoon to talk to Paco. The character also was shown topless in Playboys December 2009 issue. Paco's forced striptease would later lead to the release of a PEGI 16-rated version of the game, something that shocked and annoyed de Fondaumière – who believed the scene was not 18-worthy, and expected the finger scene over the striptease might need to be cut.

Still inexperienced at the longer event and ranked only 8th in Europe on her {{performances}} that season, she was not strongly fancied for 800 m gold. She won her heat comfortably (2:04.2) and then, two days later, produced a superb performance in the final on 18 September sprinting away from her rivals on the final bend and winning by eight metres in a personal best time of 2:01.4, a new championship record. She was the first British woman to win this European title, the second being Lynsey Sharp in 2012.|$|E

On the ensuing Nevada drive, the Wolf Pack successfully kicked a field goal giving them the lead, 0–3. On the next drive by Texas Tech, Graham Harrell's pass was intercepted by Uche Anyanwu. The next Nevada drive stalled on a three-and-out. Nevada was forced to punt to Eric Morris who took it 86 yards for a touchdown, giving the Red Raiders the lead, 7–3.

25|$|Macquarie’s arms {{was assumed}} through a 1967 {{amendment}} of the Macquarie University Act 1964 (Confirmed by Letters Patent of the College of Arms, 16 August 1969). The escutcheon displays the Macquarie Lighthouse tower, {{the first major}} public building in the colony, {{as well as the}} Sirius star, the name of the flagship of the First Fleet. The university’s founders originally wanted to base the university’s arms on Lachlan Macquarie’s family crest, however they <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> a more radical approach that represented Lachlan Macquarie as a builder and administrator. The motto chosen for the university was And Glady Teche. This is taken from the general Prologue of The Canterbury Tales, Geoffrey Chaucer c.1400 and symbolises the university's commitment to both learning and teaching. The coat of arms and the motto are used in a very limited number of formal communications.|$|E
25|$|In 1983, Fignon {{was a part}} of {{the team}} that helped Bernard Hinault to win the 1983 Vuelta a España. Guimard did not want to send Fignon to the Tour de France, because two grand tours could be too much for a 22-year-old rider. When Hinault, winner of four of the five {{previous}} Tours, announced that he would not start due to injury, the Renault team was without a leader. Fignon was added to the 1983 Tour de France selection for the Renault team, and the team <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> stage wins, with hopes of having Fignon or Marc Madiot compete for the best debutant category. After stage nine, the first mountain stage, Fignon was in second place, behind Pascal Simon, and he was allowed to be team leader. On the tenth stage, Simon crashed and broke his shoulder blade. Simon continued, and only lost a little time on the next stages. On the fifteenth stage, a mountain time trial, Fignon was able to win back so much time that he was within one minute of Simon.|$|E
25|$|Like its siblings, the Elite was run in {{numerous}} formulae, with particular success at Le Mans and the Nürburgring. Elites won their class six {{times at the}} 24 hour Le Mans race {{as well as two}} Index of Thermal Efficiency wins. Les Leston, driving DAD10, and Graham Warner, driving LOV1, were noted UK Elite racers. In 1961, David Hobbs fitted a Hobbs Mecha-Matic 4-speed automatic transmission to an Elite, and became almost unbeatable in two years' racing – he won 15 times from 18 starts. New South Wales driver Leo Geoghegan won the 1960 Australian GT Championship at the wheel of a Lotus Elite. After winning Index of Thermal Efficiency prize, Lotus <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> an outright win at Le Mans in 1960. They built a one off Elite, called the LX, with a 1,964 cc FPF engine, larger wheels, and other modifications. In testing, it proved capable of going 174mph. Unfortunately, the lead driver withdrew the night before the race, so the car did not have a chance to prove itself.|$|E

25|$|Following {{a series}} of arcade game successes in the early 1980s, Nintendo made plans to create a cartridge-based console called the Famicom, which is short for Family Computer. Masayuki Uemura {{designed}} the system. Original plans called for an advanced 16-bit system which would function as a full-fledged computer with a keyboard and floppy disk drive, but Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi rejected this and instead <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> a cheaper, more conventional cartridge-based game console as he felt that features such as keyboards and disks were intimidating to non-technophiles. A test model was constructed in October 1982 to verify the functionality of the hardware, after which work began on programming tools. Because 65xx CPUs had not been manufactured or sold in Japan up to that time, no cross-development software was available {{and it had to}} be produced from scratch. Early Famicom games were written on a system that ran on an NEC PC-8001 computer and LEDs on a grid were used with a digitizer to design graphics as no software design tools for this purpose existed at that time.|$|E
25|$|The Browns scored {{first when}} quarterback Bernie Kosar threw a 6-yard {{touchdown}} pass to running back Herman Fontenot {{at the end of}} an 86-yard drive. But then Cleveland turned the ball over on three consecutive drives. First Ricky Hunley intercepted Kosar's pass on the last play of the first quarter. Then after a punt, linebacker Jim Ryan picked off a Kosar pass and returned it 21 yards to the Browns 9-yard line. Denver then drove to the 1-yard line, but were halted there and decided to settle for Rich Karlis' 19-yard field goal. After the ensuing kickoff, running back Kevin Mack lost a fumble that was recovered by Ken Woodard on the Cleveland 37. On the next play, Denver quarterback John Elway's 34-yard scramble moved the ball to the 4-yard line. Once again, they ended up facing fourth down on the 1-yard line, but this time they <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> the touchdown and Gerald Willhite scored on a sweep right. Cleveland managed to respond with Kosar's 42-yard completion to receiver Clarence Weathers, setting up Mark Moseley's 29-yard field goal to tie the score at 10 with less than a minute left in the half.|$|E
25|$|Midway {{through the}} first quarter, the Patriots drove 71 yards to the Colts' 4-yard line, {{featuring}} a 35-yard run by Corey Dillon. On third down, running back Laurence Maroney fumbled a handoff, but the ball rolled {{into the end zone}} where offensive lineman Logan Mankins recovered it for a touchdown. The Colts responded by driving 56 yards and scoring with Adam Vinatieri's 42-yard field goal to cut their deficit to 7–3. On their ensuing drive, the Patriots drove to a fourth down on the Colts' 34-yard line. Rather than attempt a 52-yard field goal, New England <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> it and Tom Brady completed a 27-yard pass to Troy Brown. On the next play, Dillon scored on a 7-yard touchdown run. Then, two plays after the ensuing kickoff, cornerback Asante Samuel intercepted a pass from Peyton Manning and returned it 39 yards for a touchdown, giving New England a 21–3 lead. Later in the quarter, Indianapolis drove 80 yards in 15 plays, with Vinatieri finishing the drive with a 26-yard field goal, cutting the score to 21–6 with 11 seconds left in the half.|$|E

25|$|In {{the second}} quarter, Nevada's only points {{came from a}} field goal. Texas Tech drove 68 yards on five plays and scored on a one-yard run by Shannon Woods. The key play was a 50-yard pass from Harrell to Michael Crabtree who ran {{it all the way}} to the one-yard line. On the next Nevada drive, {{defensive}} end Brandon Williams tipped a pass which landed in the hands of defensive tackle Richard Jones. Both teams went scoreless the rest of the half. Nevada received the kickoff to begin the second half and immediately drove the field. Nevada's quarterback Colin Kaepernick dove into the endzone in what appeared to be a touchdown. However, after a lengthy review, the officials agreed that Texas Tech's Daniel Charbonnet forced the ball out of Kaepernick's hands resulting in a touchback. The next Red Raider drive, Mike Leach <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> a first down on fourth down, which they failed to make again. Nevada's resulting drive stalled, but they were able to kick a field goal due to good field position after the failed fourth down attempt. The only other points in the third quarter came on Texas Tech's next drive of six plays and 39 yards, scoring on Eric Morris' 13-yard run giving the Red Raiders the lead, 21–12.|$|E
25|$|John Inverarity's Western Australia were at {{the peak}} of their powers, having won the Sheffield Shield in 1967-68, 1971–72, 1972–73 and would win again in 1974-75, 1976–77 and 1977-78. Dennis Lillee had {{returned}} to the team after his back injury of 1973 and was joined by the young Terry Alderman, while Wally Edwards and Ross Edwards batted for the team. Inverarity won the toss and batted on a surface that was known for being the fastest in Australia, but straight and true. They made 265/8 on the first day and declared, with Wally Edwards making a crabby 50 in his Bill Lawry style, Ross Edwards a more fluent 40 and Mike Hendrick and Fred Titmus each taking three wickets. In reply the MCC made 314/5 before declaring half an hour before stumps, mostly from Tony Greig (167) with help from Alan Knott (62) and David Lloyd (43). Western Australia made 241 runs on the third day as Bruce Laird (43) and Inverarity (99) made slow going before Rob Langer (Justin Langer's uncle) hit 62 not out and Graeme Watson 86 not out to take their team to 346/5 and a third declaration. MCC was asked to make 298 runs in 248 minutes and Mike Denness <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> a win rather than draw. After reaching 125/2 they collapsed to the leg-spinner Bob Paulsen, who took 7/41 to give Western Australia their first victory over the MCC by 120 runs.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the second}} quarter commenced, both Brown and Gresham moved the ball for a {{touchdown}} on three different plays. Tech started their next drive at their own 38 and advanced the ball through the air to eventually get to the Oklahoma 15. Two incompletions caused the Red Raiders to face a 4th-and-3. Tech <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>for</b> it. Woods was unable to catch a pass by Harrell to convert and Tech turned the ball over on downs. Murray rushed the ball for 23yards on Oklahoma's first play of the drive. Murray followed with a 31-yard reception, which put {{the ball on the}} Tech 30. After two rushes by Brown, Gresham scored a touchdown on a 19-yard catch, and the subsequent extra point extended the Sooners lead to 21–0. Oklahoma's defense forced Tech to four plays on the next drive, with the fourth play being a 4th-and-4, Tech's second 4th down conversion attempt. With 9:31 remaining, Oklahoma completed a 1:44 scoring drive, which was capped by Juaquin Iglesias' 28-yard scoring reception. On the following possession, the Red Raiders reached the end zone, thanks to Harrell's 25-yard throw to Tramain Swindall. Matt Williams' extra point brought the score to 28–7. With 6:28 left in the half, Oklahoma began to drain the clock using their running game. The Sooners eventually scored on the 12th play of the drive. Once Tech got the ball, about a minute was left on the clock. On the second play, Harrell threw an interception to Travis Lewis, who returned the ball 47yards. Tech offensive guard Brandon Carter, who stopped Lewis at the Tech 1, received a personal foul. Murray scored on a 1-yard rush to increase the Sooners' lead to 42–7. Tech got the ball again after the Sooner touchdown with 18 seconds remaining in the game. Harrell threw a shovel pass to Baron Batch, who ran 21 yards to the Tech 28. The half ended with Tech receiving a 16-yard personal foul. The Red Raiders left the field facing their biggest deficit of the season (35 points).|$|E
