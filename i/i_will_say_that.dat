I have an opportunity of saying what I have always felt – that I am your friend, for my interests are your interests, and your interests are my interests. We were born on the same soil, breathe the same air, and live in the same land. Why, then, can we not live as brothers? <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> when the war broke out I felt it my duty to stand by my people. When the time came I did the best I could, and I don't believe I flickered. I came here with the jeers of some white people, who think that I am doing wrong. I believe that I can exert some influence, and do much to assist the people in strengthening fraternal relations, and shall do all in my power to bring about peace. It has always been my motto to elevate every man- to depress none. (Applause.) I want to elevate you to take positions in law offices, in stores, on farms, and wherever you are capable of going.|$|E

500|$|The {{scene in}} which Kurt comes out to his father was taken {{verbatim}} from series creator Ryan Murphy's own life. Murphy felt that the scene was [...] "a great thing to put on television", as, while audiences have seen gay characters isolated and attacked, they have rarely seen them ultimately winning and triumphing. He commented that: [...] "The show is about making you feel good in the end. It's about happy endings and optimism {{and the power of}} your personal journey and making you feel that the weird thing about me is the great thing about me. I’ve done other shows with gay characters, and <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> in many of those cases, the gay characters didn't have a happy ending. And I thought you know what? Enough." [...] Colfer has commented that his biggest challenge was in ensuring the scene felt [...] "honest" [...] and not comical or [...] "used as a punchline". He explained: [...] "I think it's probably the first time a character's sexuality has been respected and almost dignified in a way, and I think that's really important, and there needs to be more of that on TV." ...|$|E

500|$|In 1994, Walton {{described}} her character as, [...] "Very {{much like a}} latter-day Scarlett O'Hara. She is very manipulative and feels she is strongly justified in her actions. Jill is an individual who {{has a lot of}} difficulty in seeing what she truly is." [...] Additionally, she said that once Jill [...] "she gets a plan in her head, nothing will divert her." [...] In 1998, Walton's co-star Jeanne Cooper described Jill as [...] "Wile E. Coyote". Walton conceded that the analogy is true, saying that Jill is in [...] "constant turmoil". She stated: [...] "She gets the anvil dropped on her head and falls off the cliff. She cries and then tells everyone her new plan and how she's going to rule the world. Then it's off the cliff again." [...] Walton has said that Jill can be [...] "can be such a shrew" [...] and [...] "gets her happiness where she can, and she certainly is not going to contain her anger. She lets it out, so it does not fester in there. She is on a roller coaster though, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> much." [...] In 2009, Walton stated that she had [...] "really missed Jill being bad", but upon the character crashing Katherine's wedding to Patrick Murphy (Michael Fairman), she said that [...] "this is pretty bad". Walton stated in an interview in 2003 that she does like portraying the [...] "dark side" [...] of Jill, but rather her comedic side. She also described Jill as being [...] "so strong" [...] and [...] "such a survivor".|$|E

500|$|Manager Al López' {{decision}} not to start Pierce in the 1959 World Series against the Los Angeles Dodgers was highly controversial. After Cy Young Award winner Early Wynn started for Chicago in Game 1, Lopez chose to start Bob Shaw (18–6 in the regular season) and Dick Donovan (9–10) {{in the next two}} contests, which the White Sox lost by scores of 4–3 and 3–1. Pierce was held back until Game 4, and relieved in each of the final three games of the Series, allowing only two hits and no runs in four innings of work. In Game 4 he entered in the fourth inning with Chicago trailing 4–0, and pitched a hitless three innings before being pulled for a pinch hitter in the seventh inning, when the Sox tied the game; the Dodgers went on to win 5–4. In Game 5 he entered in the eighth inning to protect a 1–0 lead, but only issued an intentional walk before Lopez again changed pitchers; the White Sox held on for the 1–0 win. Lopez even chose to start Wynn in Game 6 on two days' rest, but he was ineffective, and Chicago was behind 8–3 by the time Pierce was brought in to start the eighth inning; the Dodgers later added a run in the ninth inning to complete the 9–3 win and capture the Series championship. Being used out of the bullpen was a deep letdown for Pierce, who said in a 1982 interview, [...] "Other guys, Early Wynn and Bob Shaw, had better years than I did that year. And against the left-handed-heavy lineup the Dodgers threw at us, Al wanted his right-handers like Dick Donovan. There was no question I was disappointed, but I understood." [...] However, there have been suggestions that Lopez' decision had other, undisclosed motivations; noting his surprise that Lopez chose to use Pierce out of the bullpen, outfielder Al Smith recalled, [...] "We all knew why Al López didn't pitch him, but we never told anyone and I won't say now. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> I thought he should have pitched. He'd been pitching all year, hadn't he?" ...|$|E

In his autobiography, Capra paraphrased his early comments to a meeting of the scientific advisory board assembled by AT and N. W.

Furthermore, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> science, in essence, is just another facet of man's quest for God." [...] At a later stage in the project, Capra wrote that the films would have [...] "the obligation to stress {{or at the very least}} to acknowledge the spiritual side of man's make-up — to acknowledge that all good things come from God — including science." ...|$|E

Bunn and Hans make for a hell of a team and issue #7 proves to be one of the series' best yet." ...|$|E
2500|$|Many {{sightings}} of girls {{in a red}} dress living in a [...] "gypsy" [...] camp were phoned in to police and followed up. By May 1, police had all but abandoned {{the idea that she}} had been stolen by [...] "gypsies," [...] and were returning their efforts to searching wells and dragging canals. Judge Sabath objected saying that the police hunt was becoming [...] "listless" [...] because Elsie's parents were poor. He was being [...] "swamped" [...] with mail, most of it containing contributions to the reward fund, from all over the country, and increased his personal contribution to $100.00 (around $2,500 in 2015) as well.

2500|$|It {{could be}} that it is {{extremely}} difficult to start life. It might be that it is so difficult to start life that it has happened only once among all the planets... Let us consider, just as a conjecture, that the chance life starting when we have got suitable physical conditions is 10−100. I don't have any logical reason for proposing this figure, I just want you to consider it as a possibility. Under those conditions ... it is almost certain that life would not have started. And I feel that under those conditions {{it will be necessary to}} assume the existence of a god to start off life. I would like, therefore, to set up this connexion between the existence of a god and the physical laws: if physical laws are such that to start off life involves an excessively small chance, so that it will not be reasonable to suppose that life would have started just by blind chance, then there must be a god, and such a god would probably be showing his influence in the quantum jumps which are taking place later on. On the other hand, if life can start very easily and does not need any divine influence, then <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> there is no god.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2009, Stewart told Vibe {{that his}} and The-Dream's fellow {{production}} associate Kuk Harrell, would be producing {{a lot of}} the album.

[...] Following Lopez's move to Island Def Jam, Lopez re-entered the studio to record new material with Harrell. Lopez later revealed that most of the album had been revamped and most production was now courtesy of Stewart and The-Dream despite recording several new songs with Moroccan producer RedOne, which made the album. Amongst those recorded with RedOne is the Latin music-influenced [...] "On the Floor" [...] which features Pitbull and a sample from Kaoma's 1989 hit single [...] "Lambada". Two other RedOne songs, co-written and co-produced by Lady Gaga, [...] "Invading My Mind" [...] and [...] "Hypnotico", also appear on Love? [...] "Hypnotico" [...] was originally recorded by recording artist Tami Chynn for her unreleased second album. Meanwhile, Lopez told fans in March 2011 that she recorded some of the album's songs in Spanish.
