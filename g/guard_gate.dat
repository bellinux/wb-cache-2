2500|$|The Welland Canal {{has been}} the focus of plots on a number of {{occasions}} throughout its existence. However, only two have ever been carried out. The earliest and potentially most devastating attack occurred on September 9, 1841 at Lock No. 37 (Allanburg) of the First Welland Canal (...) (approximately 180m north of today's Allanburg bridge), when an explosive charge destroyed one of the lock gates. However, a catastrophic flood was prevented when a <b>guard</b> <b>gate</b> located upstream of the lock closed into place preventing the upstream waters from careening down the route of the Canal and causing further damage and possible injury or loss of life. It was suspected that Benjamin Lett was responsible for the explosion.|$|E

Every [...] other garrison in turn fell in behind it, and so passed out through [...] the Bailie <b>Guard</b> <b>gate,</b> till the whole of our position was evacuated. [...] Then Havelock's force was similarly withdrawn, post by post, [...] marching in rear of our garrison.

50|$|The {{lock gates}} were 56 ft wide and 90 ft high. The locks were {{carefully}} {{designed to address}} the great variation in {{the height of the}} river, the difference between high and low water being 55 ft. This condition made it necessary to build a series of three sets of gates, increasing in height from the lower entrance to the huge upper <b>guard</b> <b>gate,</b> only two sets being used at one time. When the river was low, the upper guard gates remained open continually and the lower sets were operated. When the water rose enough to drown the lower gates, they were swung open and the lifting work was done by the others. The upper approach was formed by masonry wall extending from the <b>guard</b> <b>gate</b> in a long sweep of 1200 ft, and the bank behind was armored against floods with riprapped stone.|$|E
