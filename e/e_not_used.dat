The charter of the team was to re-evaluate large scale (1000 - 2000 Kg) Mars lander designs with the principal objective being the assurance of safe landing in hazardous terrain. The tiger team developed a number of concepts, two of the most notable and promising concepts, are both based on a Mobile Lander paradigm. Unlike the Pathfinder and Surveyor class landers, this paradigm groups all of the landed equipment into one of two categories: (1) EDL only equipment (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> after touchdown) and (2) multi-use equipment, those used during and or after touchdown. The objective is to maximize the use of all equipment being brought to the surface by placing the bulk of the avionics and mechanical systems onto a much larger 'rover' and leaving only the bare essentials on a 'dead-on-arrival' landing system. All of the hardware that the surface roving mission needs is enlisted into performing the EDL tasks. Any EDL specific avionics not used after touchdown are placed on the landing system...|$|E

The principal aim {{is to find a}} suitable parameter for interpolation of minimum temperatures in cases of nocturnal inversion. For this purpose a geostatistical parameter has been calculated and tested. It is related to the height relative to the nearest valley. The second aim is to find how the regression equation depends on the sea distance, if in a linear or non linear form and, if nonlinear, what is the best exponent. The procedure has been tested on a 1 year data set from 60 meteorological stations on Sardinia Island. The selection of parameters has been made by the forward selection method. The interpolation errors (RMSE) on independent stations (i. <b>e.</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> to calculate the regression coefficient) have been calculated by the cross-validation method using a developmental data set of size n − 1. The parameter that contains most of the variance is the height: the second one, for minimum temperatures, is the relative height. For maximum temperatures the second parameter is the sea distance, but only in summer months. The RMSE on the independent data ranges from 1. 0 to 1. 5 °C for minimum temperatures and from 0. 5 °C (winter months) to 1. 4 °C (summer months) for maximum temperatures.

40|$|Despite {{significant}} {{efforts and}} remarkable progress, the inference of signaling networks from experimental data remains very challenging. The problem is particularly difficult when {{the objective is}} to obtain a dynamic model capable of predicting the effect of novel perturbations not considered during model training. The problem is ill-posed due to the nonlinear nature of these systems, the fact that {{only a fraction of the}} involved proteins and their post-translational modifications can be measured, and limitations on the technologies used for growing cells in vitro, perturbing them, and measuring their variations. As a consequence, there is a pervasive lack of identifiability. To overcome these issues, we present a methodology called SELDOM (enSEmbLe of Dynamic lOgic-based Models), which builds an ensemble of logic-based dynamic models, trains them to experimental data, and combines their individual simulations into an ensemble prediction. It also includes a model reduction step to prune spurious interactions and mitigate overfitting. SELDOM is a data-driven method, in the sense that it does not require any prior knowledge of the system: the interaction networks that act as scaffolds for the dynamic models are inferred from data using mutual information. We have tested SELDOM on a number of experimental and in silico signal transduction case-studies, including the recent HPN-DREAM breast cancer challenge. We found that its performance is highly competitive compared to state-of-the-art methods for the purpose of recovering network topology. More importantly, the utility of SELDOM goes beyond basic network inference (i. e. uncovering static interaction networks) : it builds dynamic (based on ordinary differential equation) models, which can be used for mechanistic interpretations and reliable dynamic predictions in new experimental conditions (i. <b>e.</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> in the training). For this task, SELDOM's ensemble prediction is not only consistently better than predictions from individual models, but also often outperforms the state of the art represented by the methods used in the HPN-DREAM challenge...|$|E
40|$|Ecological regionalizations define {{geographic}} regions exhibiting relative homogeneity in ecological (i. e., {{environmental and}} biotic) characteristics. Multivariate clustering {{methods have been}} used to define ecological regions based on subjectively chosen environmental variables. We developed and tested three procedures for defining ecological regions based on spatial modeling of a multivariate target pattern that is represented by compositional dissimilarities between locations (e. g., taxonomic dissimilarities). The procedures use a "training dataset" representing the target pattern and models this as a function of environmental variables. The model is then extrapolated to the entire domain of interest. Environmental data for our analysis were drawn from a 400 m grid covering all of Switzerland and consisted of 12 variables describing climate, topography and lithology. Our target patterns comprised land cover composition of each grid cell that was derived from interpretation of aerial photographs. For Regionalization 1 we used conventional cluster analysis of the environmental variables to define 60 hierarchically organized levels comprising from 5 to 300 regions. Regionalization 1 provided a base-case for comparison with the model-based regionalizations. Regionalization 2, 3 and 4 also comprised 60 hierarchically organized levels and were derived by modeling land cover composition for 4000 randomly selected "training" cells. Regionalization 2 was based on cluster analysis of environmental variables that were transformed based on a Generalized Dissimilarity Model (GDM). Regionalization 3 and 4 were defined by clustering the training cells based on their land cover composition followed by predictive modeling of the distribution of the land cover clusters using Classification and Regression Tree (CART) and Random Forest (RF) models. Independent test data (i. <b>e.</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> to train the models) were used to test the discrimination of land cover composition at all hierarchical levels of the regionalizations using the classification strength (CS) statistic. CS for all the model-based regionalizations was significantly higher than for Regionalization 1. Regionalization 3 and 4 performed significantly better than Regionalization 2 at finer hierarchical levels (many regions) and Regionalization 4 performed significantly better than Regionalization 3 for coarse levels of detail (few regions). Compositional modeling can significantly increase the performance of numerically defined ecological regionalizations. CART and RF-based models appear to produce stronger regionalizations because discriminating variables are able to change at each hierarchic leve...|$|E
40|$|Purpose The {{expected}} {{increase in}} demand for food raises concerns about the expansion of agricultural land worldwide. To avoid expansion, {{we need to focus}} on increasing land productivity, reducing waste, and shifting human diets. Studies exploring diet shifts so far have ignored competition for land between humans and animals. Our objective was to study the relation between land use, the share of animal protein in the human diet, population size, and land availability and quality. Methods We used linear programming to determine minimum land required to feed a population a diet with 0 – 80 % of the protein derived from terrestrial domestic animals. Populations ranged from 15 million to the maximum number of people that could be supported by the system. The agricultural system in the Netherlands was used as illustration, assuming no import and export of feed and food. Daily energy and protein requirements of humans were fulfilled by a diet potentially consisting of grain (wheat), root and tuber crops (potato, sugar beet), oil crops (rapeseed), legumes (brown bean), and animal protein from ruminants (milk and meat) and monogastrics (pork). Results and discussion Land is used most efficiently if people would derive 12 % of dietary protein from animals (% PA), especially milk. The role of animals in such a diet is to convert co-products from crop production and the human food industry into protein-rich milk and meat. Below 12 % PA, human-inedible products were wasted (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>not</b> <b>used</b> for food production), whereas above 12 % PA, additional crops had to be cultivated to feed livestock. Large populations (40 million or more) could be sustained only if animal protein was consumed. This results from the fact that at high population sizes, land unsuitable for crop production was necessary to meet dietary requirements of the population, and contributed to food production by providing animal protein without competing for land with crops. Conclusions A land use optimization model including crop and animal production enables identification of the optimal % PA in the diet. Land use per capita was lowest at 12 % PA. At this level, animals optimally consume co-products from food production. Larger populations, furthermore, can be sustained only with diets relatively high in % PA, as land unsuitable for crop production is needed to fulfil their food demand. The optimal % PA in the human diet depended on population size and the relative share of land unsuitable for crop production...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purpose here}} is to enable {{peak-to-peak}} actuation of piezocomposite devices to perform shape control of structures, specifically bimorph variable-camber control surfaces on small aircraft. One of the major drawbacks in implementing control with piezocomposite actuation is its asymmetry in {{the positive and negative}} voltage directions. To remedy this situation, a novel, solid-state electrical circuit employing diodes and resistors is proposed. The circuit allows a single bipolar amplifier to control a bimorph composed of two piezoceramic composite actuators known as Macro-Fiber Composite (MFC). The MFCs have an asym-metric actuation range of 500 to 1500 V; hence an MFC bimorph with conventional serial or parallel electrical connection limits the actuation to the 500 to 500 V range. The proposed circuit allows the division of the input voltage so that: (1) The MFC that is in extension receives 1500 V, and (2) The MFC that is in compression receives 500 V. The circuit also allows the actuation in the opposite direction without any physical changes (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>not</b> <b>using</b> any electromechanical switches) The inputoutput relationship of the circuit is characterized experimentally.

Methods Cross-sectional data were used from a primary-care sample of 1, 269 insulin-naive (i. <b>e.</b> <b>not</b> <b>using</b> insulin therapy) diabetes patients participating in the DIAZOB Primary Care Diabetes study. Demographics, vascular co-morbidities, clinical and lifestyle characteristics, and psycho-social factors were assessed. Depression symptoms were measured with the Edinburgh Depression Scale, with a score> 11 defined as depression. The χ 2 and Student’s t tests were used to compare groups with and without vascular co-morbidities. Rates and odds ratios of depression were calculated for each vascular co-morbidity, with diabetes only as the reference group, correcting for age and sex. Single and multiple logistic regression analyses were performed to test a more comprehensive model regarding the likelihood of depression in diabetes. Results The prevalence of depression was 11 % in the total sample with little difference between the groups with and without any vascular co-morbidity (11. 2 % vs 10. 0 %). Single vascular co-morbidities were not associated with increased rates of depression. The final model predicting depression included: having multiple vascular co-morbidities compared with none; having less social support; having experienced a recent stressful life event; female sex; and being a smoker. Conclusions/interpretation Rates of depression in those with one additional vascular co-morbidity did not differ from patients with diabetes only.

40|$|Traditional {{techniques}} for synchronization {{are based on}} locking that provides threads with exclusive access to shared data. Coarse-grained locking typically forces threads to access large amounts of data sequentially and, thus, does not fully exploit hardware concurrency. Program-specific fine-grained locking or non-blocking (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>not</b> <b>using</b> locks) synchronization, on the other hand, is a dark art to most programmers and trusted to the wisdom of a few computing experts. Thus, it is appealing to seek a middle ground between these two extremes: a synchronization mechanism that relieves the programmer of the overhead of reasoning about data conflicts that may arise from concurrent operations without severely limiting the program's performance. The Transactional Memory (TM) abstraction is proposed as such a mechanism: it intends to combine an easy-to-use programming interface with an efficient utilization of the concurrent-computing abilities provided by multicore architectures. TM allows the programmer to speculatively execute sequences of shared-memory operations as atomic transactions with all-or-nothing semantics: the transaction can either commit, in which case it appears as executed sequentially, or abort, in which case its update operations do not take effect. Thus, the programmer can design software having only sequential semantics in mind and let TM take care, at run-time, of resolving the conflicts in concurrent executions. Intuitively, we want TMs to allow for as much concurrency as possible: {{in the absence of}} severe data conflicts, transactions should be able to progress in parallel. But what are the inherent costs associated with providing high degrees of concurrency in TMs? This is the central question of the thesis. Comment: Ph. D. Thesi...|$|R

We formulate the collaborative sensing problem as a matrix completion subproblem and a joint-sparsity reconstruction subproblem. Results of numerical simulations that validated the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed approach are presented. In particular, in noiseless cases, when number of primary user is small, exact detection was obtained with no more than 8 % of the complete sensing information, whilst as number of primary user increases, to achieve a detection rate of 95. 55 %, the required information percentage was merely 16. 8 %.

40|$|SPE paper no. 116610 -MSWalls’ work [1, 2], based around Expected Utility Theory [3], has {{highlighted}} {{the relationship between}} corporate risk tolerance and value; and others have commented on the loss of value resulting from companies behaving in a non-risk-neutral manner (i. <b>e.</b> <b>not</b> <b>using</b> expected value (EV) to make decisions) [4]. Prospect Theory [5], however, extends Utility Theory [3] to describe decisions individuals actually make under uncertainty. Key features include: diminishing utility of returns, resulting in risk aversion for gains and risk seeking for losses; use of “decision weights” rather than probabilities; and asymmetry between losses and gains, with people weighting losses more heavily. All three effects impact on a person’s risk tolerance (i. e., how risk averse or risk seeking they are). We present four studies highlighting the impact of Prospect Theory on decision value and, particularly, changes in decision value resulting from differences between individual and company risk tolerances. Study one shows losses resulting from risk aversion due to diminishing returns, discussing and comparing individual and corporate risk tolerances; the second highlights the impact of using decision weights; and the third the effect of loss/gain asymmetry. The fourth study is not directly based on Prospect Theory but rather shows {{the effect of the}} chance of ruin [6] on risk tolerance. Results indicate that the Prospect Theory effects cause changes in risk tolerance resulting in lost value compared to risk neutral decisions and that this is strongest when the probability of success is low. Any difference between individual and corporate risk tolerances also impacts on value. The results of the fourth study, conversely, show why it can benefit an individual or (less often) a company to be risk averse, as this is demonstrated to reduce the chance of ruin and thus can increase EV in the long run. Finally, we discuss the implications of these findings for corporate and individual decision makers, arguing that the corporate risk tolerances observed by Walls [1, 2] are, in fact, aggregated individual risk tolerances which should be compared to ideal corporate risk tolerances calculated using the chance of ruin for a company with a particular portfolio of investments.
