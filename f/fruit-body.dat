40|$|The Australian truffle-like fungus Mesophellia glauca is {{a common}} {{mycorrhizal}} associate of eucalypt trees and other woody shrubs. Its <b>fruit-bodies</b> also provide an important food resource {{for a variety of}} ground dwelling marsupials, including the long-nosed potoroo (Potorous tridactylus) and the Tasmanian bettong (Bettongia gaimardi). At maturity the <b>fruit-bodies</b> of M. glauca produce pungent aromas which are superficially similar to those found in the European black truffle (Tuber melanosporum). These aromas serve to attract the fungus-feeding animals. A combination of simultaneous distillation extraction with GC-MS, static and dynamic headspace GC and GC-olfactometry was used to determine the aroma profile of M. glauca. The major components of the aroma of this fungus included, 1 -octen- 3 -ol, 1 -hexen- 3 -ol, 1, 3 -octadiene, 1 -octene, hexanol, and hexan- 3 -ol. In the field, wildfires have been found to trigger increased foraging of marsupials for M. glauca. Comparison of <b>fruit-bodies</b> collected from recently burned and unburned forest indicated differences in aroma profile: <b>fruit-bodies</b> from burned sites had less of the more volatile constituents. A similar effect was reproduced when fruit bodies from an unburnt site were subjected to 60 °C heat for 30 min. However there was a major difference between the fire and heat treated <b>fruit-bodies,</b> with high levels of monoterpenes found in the former samples.

Field observations were combined with controlled laboratory experiments on cultivated <b>fruit-bodies.</b> In the field it appeared that when it is about freezing point during the day, sporulation is mainly determined by temperature factors. In milder periods, water content of the <b>fruit-bodies</b> is the major factor influencing the sporulation. There was not found a daily pattern in sporulation nor endogenic rhythm.

50|$|The {{fruit body}} size of Coprinopsis lagopus can vary tremendously. This fungus {{gives rise to}} very small fruit bodies (known as dwarf <b>fruit-bodies),</b> {{some of which are}} less than one-hundredth the size of the larger ones. In a series of experiments, Arthur Henry Reginald Buller grew spores on horse dung and noted a large range of size variation: the {{smallest}} specimen having a stem length of 1 mm and cap diameter of 0.75 mm, while the largest specimen had a stem length of 184 mm and cap diameter of 20 mm. Buller noted that the dwarf <b>fruit-bodies</b> are fully functional, producing and liberating spores in a manner identical with normal ones. The great variation in size has led some authors to erroneously name the dwarf <b>fruit-bodies</b> as new species. For example, George Edward Massee considered the dwarfs to be a new species, Coprinus radiatus. In general, dwarf <b>fruit-bodies</b> have stem lengths from 1-10 mm tall and cap of 0.75-3 mm in diameter, while large specimens have stems that are 130-185 mm tall and cap diameters of 25-40 mm.

The feeding of peptone {{to the culture}} medium at the stage of primordium formation of <b>fruit-body</b> remarkably increased the number and the dry weight of <b>fruit-body</b> per flask. The range of added peptone concentration of 0. 03 - 0. 07 % to the culture medium most effectively induced the <b>fruit-body</b> formation in F. arcularius. Furthermore, from an analysis of peptone by a liquid chromatography for clearing promotive substances in the peptone for the <b>fruit-body</b> formation, 16 free amino acids and 6 nitrogen compounds having unknown peaks were detected. It was found that lysine and leucine were the major amino acid components, but aspartic acid and glycine were minor components as the promotive substances. These amino acids were feeded in the culture medium. Consequently, aspartic acid, glycine, phenylalanine and leucine effectively induced the <b>fruit-body</b> formation. On the other hand, the effect of feeding of 0. 05 % {{in the same way}} as mentioned above of various amino acids in the culture medium were investigated. Alanine, tryptophan, arginine and glycine effectively induced the fruitbody formation. The possible role of these nitrogen sources on the <b>fruit-body</b> formation of F. arcularius is discussed.

The {{addition of a}} specific metal proteinase inhibitor, phosphoramidon, to the culture medium (10 μg/ml) completely inhibited <b>fruit-body</b> formation. Metal proteinase activity in both the medium and the mycelia of this fungus increased markedly during vegetative mycelial growth, and activity was maximal 25 days after inoculation. When phosphoramidon {{was added to the}} culture medium during vegetative mycelial growth, the metal proteinase activity in the mycelium decreased to 56 % of the control (without inhibitor) level. Isoelectric focusing analysis showed that two kinds of metal proteinases with a pl of 7.7 and 8.4, respectively, were obtained from 29 -day-old mycelia. Uptake of phosphoramidon into the mycelia was confirmed as the result of inhibition of thermolysin activity by the mycelial extracts. The degree of inhibitor uptake into mycelia was about 2.0 % and was independent of the initial concentration of the inhibitor administered. The addition of peptone and amino acids to medium treated with phosphoramidon resulted in <b>fruit-body</b> dry weight yields that were about 50 % that of the control.|$|E
40|$|The {{formation}} of the pileus in homobasidiomycete fungi is essential for sexual reproduction, because the pileus bears the hymenium, a layer of cells that includes the specialised basidia in which nuclear fusion, meiosis and sporulation occur. The developmental mutant ichijiku of Coprinus cinereus fails to develop a differentiated pileus {{at the apex of}} the primordial shaft, which is the basal part of the <b>fruit-body</b> primordia and formed in an early stage of <b>fruit-body</b> differentiation. Genetic analysis indicates that this phenotype is caused by a recessive mutation in a single gene (ich 1). The ich 1 gene was mapped to chromosome XII using restriction fragment length polymorphism markers and the marker chromosome method, and cloned by complementation using a chromosome-XII-specific cosmid library. The ich 1 gene encodes a novel protein of 1, 353 amino acids. The Ich 1 amino-acid sequence contains nuclear targeting signals, suggesting that the Ich 1 protein would function in the nucleus. Northern blot analysis indicates that the ich 1 gene is specifically expressed in the pileus of the wild-type <b>fruit-body.</b> No ich 1 mRNA was detected in the ichijiku mutant, consistent with loss of the promoter region of ich 1 in the mutant genome.

Colony morphology on culture media was variable, showing differences in density (high, low), aerial mycelia (abundant, scarce), and growth rates (fast, slow). The initial pH and the culture medium influenced colony growth rates, which ranged from 0. 02 - 1. 06 cm/day.
