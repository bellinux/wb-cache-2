5|$|The five-bay front facade has two flat Doric pilasters and {{two more}} pilasters, located off the central bay support the broken base pediment. The {{original}} door was replaced with a 19th-century door that has a 20-pane fanlight and is flanked by two flat pilasters that support the broken base pediment over the door. The main house originally had two-chimney design and another chimney {{was added to the}} east wall for a 20th-century furnace. Most of the windows in the house were replaced in the 19th century with 2-over-2 sash, except for two attic windows of each end of the gable which retain the smaller paned sashes. The house includes an earlier -story ell in the rear that {{appears to have been a}} two-room central chimney structure that was integrated into the design of the main house and built in the second quarter of the 18th century. The chimney was replaced in the 19th century. A storage shed also sits behind the house. The property also had a <b>dairy</b> <b>barn</b> that was rebuilt following its destruction in the 1938 New England hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Wind gusts {{in central}} Maryland peaked at 83mph (134km/h) in Silver Spring, with a {{location}} along the Patuxent River recording sustained winds of 55mph (88km/h). Unofficially, rainfall reached 7inches (178mm) in portions of Maryland, though the highest precipitation amount totaled 3.21inches (82mm) at the Baltimore-Washington International Airport. Swells from the hurricane produced high storm surges along the Western Shore which peaked at 8.2feet (2.5m) in Baltimore. Annapolis also reported {{a surge of}} 7.2feet (2.2m). In many locations, the storm surge was higher than the previous record set by the 1933 Chesapeake Potomac Hurricane. Throughout central Maryland, 472buildings and homes were destroyed, with 3,260 greatly damaged and another 3,600 affected in general. Strong storm surge from the hurricane washed 43,000tons (39,000 t) of salt, millions of pounds of nitrogen and phosphorus, and {{millions of gallons of}} raw sewage into the Chesapeake Bay. One person {{died as a result of}} a traffic death in the state. Property damage totaled $530.5million (2003USD, ($ USD), with an additional $190,000 (2003USD, ($ USD) in crop damage. The crop damage was primarily limited to minor damage to livestock buildings and sheds, though the winds destroyed a hay barn and a <b>dairy</b> <b>barn</b> at one farm in Frederick County. The United States Department of Agriculture estimated the winds of the hurricane destroyed 15–30% of the field corn and 10–15% of the soybean crop. Excess amounts of water led to the closure of many crab processing plants and crab house restaurants, and officials restricted harvest on shellfish for eleven days due to unsafe impurities in the water.|$|E

40|$|Ventilation {{systems in}} <b>dairy</b> <b>barns</b> help {{maintain}} a comfortable environment to keep cows healthy and productive. Cows continuously produce heat and moisture. Therefore, a ventilation system {{is necessary to}} constantly exchange warm, humid air inside the barn for cooler, drier air outside of the barn. This exchange must occur regardless of outside temperature or weather conditions. Fresh outside air is required even on a cold, windy night to reduce moisture accumulation inside the barn. Good air exchange also removes nuisance odors and manure gases that can have negative effects on animal health and performance. Most ventilation problems associated with <b>dairy</b> <b>barns</b> are due to inadequate design, construction, and/or operation of the facility. <b>Dairy</b> <b>barns</b> are usually designed...|$|R

25|$|The <b>dairy</b> <b>barn</b> {{remains an}} iconic image of Vermont, but the 87% {{decrease}} in active dairy farms between 1947 and 2003 means that {{preservation of the}} dairy barns has increasingly become dependent upon a commitment to maintaining a legacy rather than basic need in the agricultural economy. The Vermont Barn Census, organized by a collaboration of educational and nonprofit state and local historic preservation programs, has developed educational and administrative systems for recording the number, condition, and features of barns throughout Vermont.|$|E
40|$|Bio-aerosol is a {{well-known}} cause of respiratory diseases. Exposure to bio-aerosols has been reported previously in <b>dairy</b> <b>barns,</b> but {{little is known about}} the sources of bio-aerosol. Bedding materials might be a significant source or substrate for bio-aerosol exposure. The aim of this study was to explore bio-aerosol exposure levels and its determinants in <b>dairy</b> <b>barns</b> with various bedding materials. Dust samples were collected at <b>dairy</b> <b>barns</b> using various bedding materials. Samples were analyzed for endotoxin and β(1 → 3) -glucan contents. Culturable bacteria and fungi were sampled by the Anderson N 6 impactor. Exposure models were constructed using linear mixed models. The personal exposure levels to dust, endotoxin, and β(1 → 3) -glucan differed significantly between the barns utilizing diverse main bedding types (...|$|R

The plan called for the razing of nearly a dozen 1950s to 1970s vintage buildings; the construction of new dormitories, administration, and classroom buildings; as well as {{the development of a new}} pedestrian mall extending to Lake Mendota.

25|$|In December 1982, Webb, Howard Emmett Bramblett {{of nearby}} Ocoee, and David Parks {{decided to start}} {{manufacturing}} illegal M-80 and M-100 fireworks in an old metal <b>dairy</b> <b>barn</b> on the farm.

They employed several family members of Webb and Parks. Most employees were unaware and not educated in the dangerous working conditions. Between December 1982 and the date of the explosion, at least 1,542,000 of the M-series fireworks were reported to have been manufactured at the factory and distributed to at least twelve states. Months before the explosion, the Polk County Sheriff's Office, Tennessee Bureau of Investigation (TBI), and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF) had received word of an illegal fireworks operation in the area, but were uncertain of the location.|$|E
