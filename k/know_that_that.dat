Although Joel has said that artists tend to [...] "meet up with Philistines", he added: [...] "Barton Fink is quite far from our own experience. Our professional life in Hollywood has been especially easy, and this is no doubt extraordinary and unfair". Ethan has suggested that Lipnick– like the men on which he is based– is in some ways a product of his time. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> kind of character exists anymore. Hollywood is a little more bland and corporate than that now".|$|E

Francis finishes Deal's sentences, joking that her response to hearing of the teacher's activities {{was to try to}} join the team. Albini later observed the use of studio banter on Surfer Rosa: [...] "It's on their record forever so I think now they are obliged to say that they're ok with it, but I honestly don't <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> idea would've ever come up if I hadn't done it.

I don't want to be messing around with no contenders." [...] The rivalry continued into 2012 with Green stating: [...] "He won the fight on the night but since then he's avoided the immediate rematch clause" [...] and [...] "Most people in Australia <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> victory is pretty shallow, as far as him fighting a dehydrated, starving ghost" [...] (referring to the considerable weight drop Green undertook for the fight with Mundine).|$|E

When we see a monk sitting on a rock, looking tranquilly up to heaven, with a human skull beside him, and without other baggage, we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>that</b> is St. Jerome. Because we know that he always went flying light in the matter of baggage. When we see other monks looking tranquilly up to heaven, but having no trade-mark, we always ask who those parties are. We do this because we humbly wish to learn." ...|$|E
