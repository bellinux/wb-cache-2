50|$|While the use {{of atoms}} offers easy access to higher {{frequencies}} (and thus accuracies) than light, atoms are affected much more strongly by gravity. In some apparatuses, the atoms are ejected upwards and the interferometry takes place while the atoms are in flight, or while falling in free flight. In other experiments gravitational effects by <b>free</b> <b>acceleration</b> are not negated; additional forces are used to compensate for gravity. While these guided systems in principle can provide arbitrary amounts of measurement time, their quantum coherence is still under discussion. Recent theoretical studies indicate that coherence is indeed preserved in the guided systems, but this {{has yet to be}} experimentally confirmed.|$|E

The main aim of the preliminary engine test was to use of the crankshaft <b>free</b> <b>acceleration</b> method for detection of diesel knock phenomenon.

40|$|Abstract. A {{method for}} modal {{parameter}} identification of time-varying structures based on Hilbert-Huang transform (HHT) is presented. Theoretical formulas for identifying the modal frequency and damping radio using the displacement response of a time-varying SDOF structure are deduced.

Numerical simulation of a three degrees of freedom structure with time-varying stiffness and damping show {{the validity of the}} method. Finally, a time-varying structure experiment is designed to further study the method. The experimental device is a cantilever beam. By adjusting the adjunctive mass and stiffness, two kinds of time-varying structures with continuous mass change and stiffness change is realized respectively.

40|$|A new {{parameters}} {{determination method}} for squirrel-cage induction motors is presented. As a main contribution, the method uses the instantaneous electrical {{power and the}} mechanical speed measured in a <b>free</b> <b>acceleration</b> test to estimate the double-cage model parameters. The parameters are estimated from the machine impedance calculated at several points. At speed points where the double-cage effect is significant, i. e., between the zero speed point and the maximum torque point, the machine impedance is evaluated by the instantaneous power method, and at speed points where the double-cage effect is not significant, i. e., between the maximum torque point and synchronism, the machine impedance is evaluated by a dynamic-model-based linear least-square method. The proposed method {{has been applied to}} obtain the parameters of three motors tested in the laboratory. To check the method accuracy, the steady-state torque and current-slip curves predicted by the estimated parameters are successfully compared with those measured in the laboratory.

Both solvers start from the primitive variables formulation of the Stokes problem, but are distinct by the numerical uncoupling they apply on the Stokes operator.
