50|$|<b>Ground</b> loops - When <b>grounding</b> a circuit, it is {{important}} to avoid <b>ground</b> loops. <b>Ground</b> loops occur when there is a voltage drop between the two <b>ground</b> potentials. Since <b>ground</b> is thought of as 0 V, the presence of a voltage is undesirable at any point of a <b>ground</b> bus. If this is the case, {{it would not be a}} true <b>ground.</b> A good way to fix this is to bring all the <b>ground</b> wires to the same potential in a <b>ground</b> bus.|$|R
