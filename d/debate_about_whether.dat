5|$|There are {{two main}} issues {{concerning}} the locomotory abilities of Tyrannosaurus: how well it could turn; and what its maximum straight-line speed was likely to have been. Both {{are relevant to the}} <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> it was a hunter or a scavenger.|$|E
5|$|According to some scholars, the Black Stone was {{the same}} stone that Islamic {{tradition}} describes as greeting Muhammad before his prophethood. This led to a <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> the Black Stone's greeting comprised actual speech or merely a sound, and following that, whether the stone was a living creature or an inanimate object. Whichever was the case, the stone was held to be a symbol of prophethood.|$|E
5|$|A.M. is {{the debut}} studio album by the American {{alternative}} rock band Wilco, released on March 28, 1995, by Sire Records and Reprise Records. The album was released only {{months after the}} breakup of Uncle Tupelo, an alternative country band that was the predecessor of Wilco. Prior to its release, there was <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> the album {{would be better than}} the debut album of Son Volt, the new band of former Uncle Tupelo lead singer Jay Farrar.|$|E

5000|$|The {{ethics of}} Edward Snowden's actions {{have been widely}} {{discussed}} and debated in news media and academia worldwide. Edward Snowden released classified intelligence to the American people {{in an attempt to}} allow Americans to see {{the inner workings of the}} government. A person is diligently tasked with the [...] of choosing to be loyal to the company or to blow the whistle on the company's wrongdoing. Discussions on whistleblowing generally revolve around three topics: attempts to define whistleblowing more precisely, <b>debates</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> and when whistleblowing is permissible, and <b>debates</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> and when one has an obligation to blow the whistle.|$|R
5|$|For {{many years}} Odontogriphus ("toothed riddle") was known from only one specimen, an almost featureless oval smear on a slab, with hints of tiny conical teeth. However, 189 new finds {{in the years}} {{immediately}} preceding 2006 made a detailed description possible. It had a pair of slightly V-shaped tooth-rows just ahead of the mouth, very like Wiwaxia′s. This pitched Odontogriphus {{into the middle of the}} <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> Wiwaxia was closer to the mollusc or the annelid lineage, resulting in a frank exchange of views.|$|E
5|$|However, other discoveries and {{analyses}} soon followed, revealing similar-looking {{animals such as}} Anomalocaris from the Burgess Shale and Kerygmachela from Sirius Passet. Another Burgess Shale animal, Aysheaia, was considered very similar to modern Onychophora, which are regarded as close relatives of arthropods. Paleontologists defined a group called lobopods to include animals that {{are thought to be}} close relatives of arthropods but lack jointed limbs. There is still <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> lobopods are monophyletic, i.e. whether they include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor, and about whether arthropods are a sub-group of lobopods or a sister-group.|$|E
5|$|The adverse results {{momentarily}} {{put a stop}} to Republican {{calls to}} impeach Johnson, who was elated by the elections. Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, the Judiciary Committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson. After much <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> anything the President had done was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard under the Constitution, the resolution was defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7, 1867, by a vote of 57 in favor to 108 opposed.|$|E
50|$|Comfrey {{has been}} used in folk {{medicine}} as a poultice for treating burns and wounds. However, internal consumption, such as in the form of herbal tea, is discouraged, as it has been highly <b>debated</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> it can cause serious liver damage.|$|R
500|$|The {{phylogeny}} (evolutionary [...] "family tree") of molluscs is {{a controversial}} subject. In {{addition to the}} <b>debates</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> Kimberella and any of the [...] "halwaxiids" [...] were molluscs or closely related to molluscs, <b>debates</b> arise <b>about</b> {{the relationships between the}} classes of living molluscs. In fact, some groups traditionally classified as molluscs may have to be redefined as distinct but related.|$|R
50|$|Despite the {{division}} of the country, Buddhism spread throughout the land. In southern China, fierce <b>debates</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> Buddhism should be allowed were held frequently by the royal court and nobles. Finally, {{towards the end of the}} Southern and Northern Dynasties era, Buddhists and Taoists reached a compromise and became more tolerant of each other.|$|R
5|$|The <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> Tyrannosaurus was a {{predator}} or a pure scavenger {{is as old}} as the debate about its locomotion. Lambe (1917) described a good skeleton of Tyrannosaurus close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also Tyrannosaurus was a pure scavenger, because the Gorgosaurus teeth showed hardly any wear. This argument is no longer taken seriously, because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of Tyrannosaurus most scientists have speculated that it was {{a predator}}; like modern large predators it would readily scavenge or steal another predator's kill if it had the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|The {{executive}} {{summary of the}} TRC concluded that the assimilation amounted to cultural genocide. The ambiguity of the phrasing allowed for the interpretation that physical and biological genocide also occurred. The TRC was not authorized to conclude that physical and biological genocide occurred, as such a finding would imply a legal responsibility of the Canadian government that {{would be difficult to}} prove. As a result, the <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> the Canadian government also committed physical and biological genocide against Indigenous populations remains open.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> the Khazzoom-Brookes Postulate is correct, {{and of the}} relevance of the Jevons paradox to energy conservation policy. Most governments, environmentalists and NGOs pursue policies that improve efficiency, holding that it will lower resource consumption and reduce environmental problems. Others, including many environmental economists, doubt this 'efficiency strategy' towards sustainability, and worry that efficiency gains may in fact lead to higher production and consumption. They hold that for resource use to fall, efficiency gains should be coupled with other policies that limit resource use.|$|E
50|$|Emperor Constans’ {{grandfather}} Heraclius {{had spent}} the last few years of his life attempting to find a compromise theological position between the Monophysites and the Chalcedonians over their <b>debates</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> Jesus Christ had one nature or two separate natures. What he promoted via his Ecthesis was a doctrine which declared that Jesus, whilst he possessed two distinct natures, had only one will.|$|R

5|$|The {{existing}} draft law {{was scheduled}} to conclude {{at the end of}} June 1971, and the Senate faced a contentious <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> to extend it as the Vietnam War continued. The Nixon administration announced in February 1971 that it wanted a two-year extension to June 1973, after which the draft would end; Army planners had already been operating under the assumption of a two-year extension, after which an all-volunteer force would be in place. Skeptics such as Senate Armed Services Committee chairman John Stennis thought this unrealistic and wanted a four-year extension, but the two-year proposal is what went forward in Congress. By early May 1971, Gravel had indicated his intention to filibuster the draft renewal legislation, halting conscription and thereby bringing U.S. involvement in the war to a rapid end.|$|E
5|$|The {{sea mink}} (Neovison macrodon) is a {{recently}} extinct species of mink {{from the eastern}} coast of North America in the family Mustelidae, the largest family in the order Carnivora. It was most {{closely related to the}} American mink (Neovison vison), with <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> or not the sea mink should be considered a subspecies of the American mink (making it Neovison vison macrodon) or a species of its own. The main justification for a separate species designation is the size difference between the two minks, but other distinctions have been made, such as its redder fur. The only known remains are fragments unearthed in Native American shell middens. Its actual size is speculative, based largely on tooth remains.|$|E

Though the Premier had appealed for businesses to voluntarily close, Anzac Day was not formally gazetted as a public holiday in Queensland during the wartime commemorations. Some public servants were granted leave to attend the church memorial services in the morning.|$|R

25|$|Huxley's famous {{debate in}} 1860 with Samuel Wilberforce {{was a key}} moment in the wider {{acceptance}} of evolution and in his own career. Huxley had been planning to leave Oxford on the previous day, but, after an encounter with Robert Chambers, the author of Vestiges, {{he changed his mind}} and decided to join the debate. Wilberforce was coached by Richard Owen, against whom Huxley also <b>debated</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> humans were closely related to apes.|$|R
5|$|After World War II, a <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> {{a country}} should {{introduce}} financial planning to develop itself or rely on private entrepreneurs emerged. Nurkse {{believed that the}} subject of who should promote development does not concern economists. It is an administrative problem. The crucial idea was that {{a large amount of}} well dispersed investment should be made in the economy, so that the market size expands and leads to higher productivity levels, increasing returns to scale and eventually the development of the country in question. However, {{it should be noted that}} most economists who favoured the balanced growth hypothesis believed that only the state has the capacity to take on the kind of heavy investments the theory propagates. Further, the gestation period of such lumpy investments is usually long and private sector entrepreneurs do not normally undertake such high risks.|$|E
5|$|By October 2007, Vildanden was {{in severe}} {{financial}} distress. An agreement {{was made with}} the municipal council, where the latter gave a credit loan to the airline. The route to Molde had given large deficits, and the company was forced to close it down. NOK2.3 million, equal to the airlines debt to the airport, was granted to the municipal-owned airport operator, and the company allowed to make an agreement where half the debt was deleted, {{and the other half}} made interest and principal-free for two years. At the same time, the management of Vildanden had to raise new capital equal to at least half the companies accounts payable, which was NOK8 million. The case raised local <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> it was the municipality's job to subsidize the airport and the airline. The Federation of Norwegian Aviation Industries announced that they would consider reporting the subsidies to the EFTA Surveillance Authority (ESA) for violation of the European Community competition law.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of {{significant amounts of}} dust around the star implies a young age {{of the system and}} led to <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> it had joined the main sequence or was still a pre–main sequence star However, when the star's distance was measured by Hipparcos it was revealed that Beta Pictoris was located further away than previously thought and hence was more luminous than originally believed. Once the Hipparcos results were taken into account, it was found that Beta Pictoris was located close to the zero age main sequence and was not a pre–main sequence star after all. Analysis of Beta Pictoris and other stars within the Beta Pictoris moving group suggested that they are around 12 million years old. However more recent studies indicate that the age is roughly double this at 20 to 26 million years old.|$|E
40|$|Until recently, {{the popular}} notion that psychoemotional stress {{can have an}} impact on hair growth has been treated with {{skepticism}} and assigned to the realm of folklore by many authorities. Yet it has long been appreciated that episodes of alopecia areata (AA) have occurred after severely stressful life events (Reinhold, 1960; Whitlock, 1976). This has triggered <b>debates</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> AA should be considered a psychosomatic disorder (Misery and Rousset, 2001; Willemsen et al., 2009) ...|$|R
50|$|The two differ radically {{in their}} {{opinions}} about Abraham Lincoln and have engaged <b>debates</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> Lincoln should be embraced or shunned by conservatives. This controversy over Lincoln's significance to conservatives predates both think tanks, and encompasses Jaffa's debates {{on the subject}} with National Review editor Frank Meyer and scholar M.E. Bradford. In 2002, Jaffa debated Thomas DiLorenzo, a Senior Fellow at the LvMI {{on the merits of}} Lincoln's statesmanship during the American Civil War.|$|R
25|$|In 1974, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions {{was ranked}} {{as the second}} most {{frequently}} used book in political science courses focused on scope and methods. In particular, Kuhn’s theory {{has been used by}} political scientists to critique behavioralism, which claims that accurate political statements must be both testable and falsifiable. The book also proved popular with political scientists embroiled in <b>debates</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> a set of formulations put forth by a political scientists constituted a theory, or something else.|$|R
5|$|There {{has long}} been <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> the qualities of mind, personality, and {{intelligence}} {{can be attributed to}} heredity or to upbringing—this is the nature and nurture controversy. Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does. In some respects, all that matters is {{the presence or absence of}} experience during critical periods of development. In other respects, the quantity and quality of experience are important; for example, there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.|$|E
5|$|Orthrozanclus reburrus ("Dawn scythe with bristling hair") was {{discovered}} in 2006 and formally described in 2007. This animal had a soft, unarmored underside, but the upward-facing surfaces were armored by: a small shell, near the front end; three zones of armor plates, which fitted close to the body and one of which ran all the way round the animal; 16 to 20 long, upwards-curving spines {{on each side of}} the body. The arrangement of Orthrozanclus′ armor plates is very similar to that of its Burgess Shale contemporary Wiwaxia. Its shell is very similar to one of the two Burgess Shale shell types labelled Oikozetetes; the forward shell of halkieriids, most fossils of which are dated to the Early Cambrian; and those of other Early Cambrian fossils such as Ocruranus and Eohalobia. These similarities suggest that Orthrozanclus was an intermediate form between Wiwaxia and the Halkieriids and that all three of these taxa formed a clade, in other words a group that consists of a common ancestor and all of its descendants. So Orthrozanclus was also drawn into the complex <b>debate</b> <b>about</b> <b>whether</b> Wiwaxia is more closely related to molluscs or to polychaete worms.|$|E
