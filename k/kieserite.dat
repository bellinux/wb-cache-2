25|$|Minerals that {{generally}} require water for their formation {{have been found}} in ILDs, thus supporting water in the system. The European Space Agency's Mars Express found possible evidence for the sulfates epsomite and <b>kieserite,</b> minerals that form in water. Ferric oxide in the form of crystalline grey hematite, which typically requires water for its formation, was also detected.|$|E
25|$|Aqueous {{minerals}} are minerals {{that form}} in water, either by chemical alteration of pre-existing rock or by precipitation out of solution. The minerals indicate where liquid water existed {{long enough to}} react chemically with rock. Which minerals form depends on temperature, salinity, pH, and composition of the parent rock. Which aqueous minerals are present on Mars therefore provides important clues to understanding past environments. The OMEGA spectrometer and the MER rovers both uncovered evidence for aqueous minerals. OMEGA revealed two distinct kinds of aqueous deposits. The first, containing sulfates such as gypsum and <b>kieserite,</b> is found in layered deposits of Hesperian age (Martian middle age, roughly from 3.7 to 3 billion years ago). The second, rich in several different kinds of phyllosilicates, instead occurs rocks of Noachian age (older than about 3.7 billion years). The different ages and mineral chemistries suggest an early water-rich environment in which phyllosilicates formed, followed by a dryer, more saline and acidic environment in which sulfates formed. The MER Opportunity rover spent years exploring sedimentary rocks formed in the latter environment, full of sulfates, salts, and oxidized iron minerals.|$|E
2500|$|Few rocks {{were visible}} on the surface where Opportunity landed, but bedrock that was exposed in craters was {{examined}} by the suite of instruments on the Rover. [...] Bedrock rocks {{were found to be}} sedimentary rocks with a high concentration of sulfur in the form of calcium and magnesium sulfates. [...] Some of the sulfates that may be present in bedrocks are <b>kieserite,</b> sulfate anhydrate, bassanite, hexahydrite, epsomite, and gypsum. [...] Salts, such as halite, bischofite, antarcticite, bloedite, vanthoffite, or gluberite may also be present.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kieserite</b> (MgSO4·H2O) {{is a less}} {{hydrated}} magnesium sulfate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kieserite</b> is the {{magnesium}} sulfate mineral (MgSO4·H2O) and {{is named after}} Dietrich Georg von Kieser (Jena, Germany 1862). It has a vitreous luster and it is colorless, grayish-white or yellowish. Its hardness is 3.5 and crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system. Gunningite is the zinc member of the <b>kieserite</b> group of minerals.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Kieserite</b> MgSO4•H2O, Szomolnokite Fe2+SO4•H2O, Szmikite MnSO4•H2O, Poitevinite (Cu,Fe2+,Zn)SO4•H2O, Gunningite (Zn,Mn)SO4•H2O, Dwornikite (Ni,Fe2+)SO4•H2O, Cobaltkieserite CoSO4•H2O ...|$|E
50|$|<b>Kieserite,</b> MgSO4·H2O, can be {{combined}} with a solution of potassium chloride to produce potassium sulfate.|$|E
50|$|Mineral {{associations}} {{based on}} some physical properties include, but not limited to, halite, anhydrite, dolomite, gypsum, kainite, <b>kieserite,</b> polyhalite, and sylvite.|$|E
50|$|<b>Kieserite</b> {{commonly}} {{occurs in}} marine evaporites and rarely in volcanic environments as a sublimate. It occurs {{in association with}} halite, carnallite, polyhalite, anhydrite, boracite, sulfoborite, leonite, epsomite and celestine.|$|E
50|$|Kainite is {{a typical}} {{secondary}} mineral that forms through metamorphosis in marine deposits of potassium carbonate, and is also occasionally formed through resublimation from volcanic vapours. It is often accompanied by anhydrite, carnallite, halite, and <b>kieserite.</b>|$|E
50|$|Gunningite {{is one of}} the {{minerals}} in the <b>Kieserite</b> group. Its chemical formula is (Zn,Mn2+)SO4·H2O. Its name honours Henry Cecil Gunning (1901-1991) of the Geological Survey of Canada and a Professor at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada.|$|E
50|$|Secondary {{reactions}} {{can produce}} or consume leonite in evaporite deposits. Leonite can convert to polyhalite, and <b>kieserite</b> {{can be changed}} to leonite, Groundwater penetrating bittern salt deposits can convert some to leonite, particularly in the cap regions of salt domes.|$|E
50|$|Some {{places on}} Mars contain {{hydrated}} sulfate deposits, including ILD's. Sulfate formation involves {{the presence of}} water. The European Space Agency's Mars Express found possible evidence of the sulfates epsomite and <b>kieserite.</b> Scientists want to visit these areas with robotic rovers.|$|E
5000|$|Abraum salts is {{the name}} given to a mixed deposit of salts, {{including}} halite (sodium chloride), carnallite, and <b>kieserite</b> (magnesium sulfate), found in association with rock salt at Aschersleben-Staßfurt in Germany. The term comes from the German Abraum-salze, [...] "salts to be removed." ...|$|E
50|$|Another common mineral {{abrasive}} is garnet. Garnet is {{more expensive}} than silica sand, but if used correctly, will offer equivalent production rates while producing less dust and no safety hazards from ingesting the dust. Magnesium sulphate, or <b>kieserite,</b> is often used {{as an alternative to}} baking soda.|$|E
50|$|In early 2005, Mars Express, a European Space Agency orbiter, {{discovered}} {{evidence of}} <b>kieserite</b> in patches of Valles Marineris (the largest canyon on Mars), along with gypsum and polyhydrated sulfates. This is direct evidence of Mars's watery past and augments similar discoveries {{made by the}} Mars Exploration Rover Opportunity in 2004.|$|E
50|$|The Opportunity Rover (landed in 2004 with {{advanced}} instruments) found magnesium sulfate and calcium sulfate at Meridiani Planum. Using {{results from the}} chemical measurements, mineral models suggest that the soil could be a mixture of about 80% iron-rich clay, about 10% magnesium sulfate (<b>kieserite?),</b> about 5% carbonate (calcite), and about 5% iron oxides (hematite, magnetite, goethite?).|$|E
5000|$|Theiikian (named after {{sulphurous}} in Greek, for the [...] {{that were}} formed) lasted until about 3.5 Gya. It was {{an era of}} extensive volcanism, which released large amounts of sulphur dioxide (SO2) into the atmosphere. The SO2 combined with water to create a sulphuric acid-rich environment that allowed the formation of hydrated sulphates (notably <b>kieserite</b> and gypsum).|$|E
50|$|Magnesium sulfate is an {{inorganic}} salt (chemical compound) containing magnesium, sulfur and oxygen, with the formula MgSO4. It is often encountered as the heptahydrate sulfate mineral epsomite (MgSO4·7H2O), commonly called Epsom salt. The monohydrate, MgSO4·H2O is found as the mineral <b>kieserite.</b> The overall global annual usage {{in the mid-1970s}} of the monohydrate was 2.3 million tons, of which the majority was used in agriculture.|$|E
50|$|Healthy, well {{selected}} seedlings {{are necessary}} for early and sustained high yield. In most cases, granular multinutrient compound fertilizers are the preferred nutrient source for seedlings in the nursery. Where subsoil is used to fill the polybags, extra dressings of <b>Kieserite</b> may be required (10-15 g every six to eight weeks). Where compound fertilizers are not available, equivalent quantities of straight materials should be used.|$|E
50|$|Parts of {{the floor}} of Candor Chasma {{contains}} layered deposits that have been termed interior layered deposits (ILD's). These layers may have formed when the whole area was a giant lake. Some places on Mars contain hydrated sulfate deposits. Sulfate formation involves the presence of water. The European Space Agency's Mars Express found evidence of perhaps epsomite and <b>kieserite.</b> Scientists want to visit these areas with robotic rovers.|$|E
50|$|With Adam von Eschenmayer and Christian Friedrich Nasse, he {{published}} the 12-volume Archiv für den thierischen Magnetismus ("Archive for animal magnetism"). Kieser was politically active throughout his career; in October 1817 with philosophers Lorenz Oken and Jakob Friedrich Fries, he partook {{in the historic}} Wartburg Festival. In 1858 he was named president of the Deutsche Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina. He died in Jena. A magnesium sulfate mineral known as <b>kieserite</b> is named after him.|$|E
5000|$|Few rocks {{were visible}} on the surface where Opportunity landed, but bedrock that was exposed in craters was {{examined}} by the suit of instruments on the Rover. [...] Bedrock rocks {{were found to be}} sedimentary rocks with a high concentration of sulfur in the form of calcium and magnesium sulfates. Some of the sulfates that may be present in bedrocks are <b>kieserite,</b> sulfate anhydrate, bassanite, hexahydrite, epsomite, and gypsum. Salts, such as halite, bischofite, antarcticite, bloedite, vanthoffite, or gluberite may also be present.|$|E
50|$|Bischofite {{deposits}} {{differ by}} their composition: {{some of them}} are salt basins where bischofite is mixed with other minerals such as carnallite, halite, <b>kieserite</b> and anhydrite. These are the so-called bischofite containing rocks which have pink-brown-yellow and orange-red colors. They contain 36-58% of bischofite. Carnallite deposits are known in Staßfurt, Germany - where bischofite was first discovered, and carnallite {{is one of the most}} important minerals in potassium salt deposits (Solykam deposit, Ural, Russia). Sub-surface bischofite layers were also discovered in Kazakhstan, Turkmenistan, China and the US.|$|E
5000|$|Almost {{all known}} mineralogical forms of MgSO4 occur as hydrates. Epsomite {{is the natural}} {{analogue}} of [...] "Epsom salt". Another heptahydrate, the copper-containing mineral alpersite (Mg,Cu)SO4·7H2O, was recently recognized. Both are, however, not the highest known hydrates of MgSO4, due to the recent terrestrial find of meridianiite, MgSO4·11H2O, which is thought to also occur on Mars. Hexahydrite is the next lower (6) hydrate. Three next lower hydrates — pentahydrite (5), starkeyite (4) and especially sanderite (2) — are more rarely found. <b>Kieserite</b> is a monohydrate and is common among evaporitic deposits. Anhydrous magnesium sulfate was reported from some burning coal dumps, but was never treated as a mineral.|$|E
5000|$|Results from Viking lander {{experiments}} {{strongly suggest}} {{the presence of}} water in the present and in the past of Mars. All samples heated in the gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GSMS) gave off water. However, the way the samples were handled prohibited an exact measurement of the amount of water. But, it was around 1%. [...] General chemical analysis suggested the surface had been exposed to water in the past. Some chemicals in the soil contained sulfur and chlorine that were like those remaining after sea water evaporates. Sulfur was more concentrated in the crust on top of the soil, than in the bulk soil beneath. So it was concluded that the upper crust was cemented together with sulfates that were transported to the surface dissoved in water. This process is common on Earth's deserts. The sulfur may be present as sulfates of sodium, magnesium, calcium, or iron. A sulfide of iron is also possible. Using results from the chemical measurements, mineral models suggest that the soil could be a mixture of about 90% iron-rich clay, about 10% magnesium sulfate (<b>kieserite?),</b> about 5% carbonate (calcite), and about 5% iron oxides (hematite, magnetite, goethite?). These minerals are typical weathering products of mafic igneous rocks. The presence of clay, magnesium sulfate, <b>kieserite,</b> calcite, hematite, and goethite strongly suggest that water was once in the area. [...] Sulfate contains chemically bound water, hence its presence suggests water was around in the past. Viking 2 found similar group of minerals. Because Viking 2 was much farther north, pictures it took in the winter showed frost.|$|E

50|$|Carnallite {{occurs with}} a {{sequence}} of potassium and magnesium evaporite minerals: sylvite, kainite, picromerite, polyhalite, and <b>kieserite.</b> Carnallite is an uncommon double chloride mineral that only forms under specific environmental conditions in an evaporating sea or sedimentary basin. It is mined for both potassium and magnesium and occurs in the evaporite deposits of Carlsbad, New Mexico; the Paradox Basin in Colorado and Utah; Stassfurt, Germany; the Perm Basin, Russia; and the Williston Basin in Saskatchewan, Canada. These deposits date from the Devonian through the Permian Periods. In contrast, both Israel and Jordan produce potash from the Dead Sea by using evaporation pans to further concentrate the brine until carnallite precipitates, dredging the carnallite from the pans, and processing to remove the magnesium chloride from the potassium chloride.|$|E

[...] MRO discovered sulfates, hydrated sulfates, and iron oxides in Juventae Chasma. [...] Juventae Chasma has four bright mounds or light-toned interior layered deposits (IlD's), as they are often called. Researchers have found that monohydrated sulfates were first deposited on the floor. And then polyhydrated sulfates were laid down. <b>Kieserite,</b> a magnesium sulfate, was also found in Juventae Chasma. Studies from satellites orbiting Mars have found channels on the eastern, western, and southern walls of Juventae Chasma. They seem to have different origins. Some may have started from melting snow, others from groundwater sapping, and still others from precipitation. Inverted channels are also present.|$|E

The rocks contained the sulfates had a light tone compared to isolated rocks and rocks examined by landers/rovers at other locations on Mars. The spectra of these light toned rocks, containing hydrated sulfates, were similar to spectra taken by the Thermal Emission Spectrometer on board the Mars Global Surveyor. The same spectrum is found over a large area, so it is believed that water once appeared over a wide region, not just in the area explored by Opportunity Rover.|$|E
50|$|Geologic evidence, such as {{the flow}} {{direction}} of ancient valley networks around Tharsis, indicates that the bulge was largely {{in place by the}} end of the Noachian Period, some 3.7 billion years ago. Although the bulge itself is ancient, volcanic eruptions in the region continued throughout Martian history and probably played a significant role in the production of the planet's atmosphere and the weathering of rocks on the planet's surface. By one estimate, the Tharsis bulge contains around 300 million km3 of igneous material. Assuming the magma that formed Tharsis contained carbon dioxide (CO2) and water vapor in percentages comparable to that observed in Hawaiian basaltic lava, then the total amount of gases released from Tharsis magmas could have produced a 1.5-bar CO2 atmosphere and a global layer of water 120 m thick. Martian magmas also likely contain significant amounts of sulfur and chlorine. These elements combine with water to produce acids that can break down primary rocks and minerals. Exhalations from Tharsis and other volcanic centers on the planet are likely responsible for an early period of Martian time (the Theiikian) when sulfuric acid weathering produced abundant hydrated sulfate minerals such as <b>kieserite</b> and gypsum.|$|E

5000|$|Marine evaporites {{tend to have}} thicker {{deposits}} and are usually the focus of more extensive research. [...] They also have a system of evaporation. When scientists evaporate ocean water in a laboratory, the minerals are deposited in a defined order that was first demonstrated by Usiglio in 1884. The {{first phase of the}} experiment begins when about 50% of the original water depth remains. At this point, minor carbonates begin to form. The next phase in the sequence comes when the experiment is left with about 20% of its original level. At this point, the mineral gypsum begins to form, which is then followed by halite at 10%, excluding carbonate minerals that tend not to be evaporates. The most common minerals that are generally considered to be the most representative of marine evaporates are calcite, gypsum and anhydrite, halite, sylvite, carnallite, langbeinite, polyhalite, and kainite. <b>Kieserite</b> (MgSO4) may also be included, which often will make up less than four percent of the overall content. However, there are approximately 80 different minerals that have been reported found in evaporite deposits (Stewart,1963;Warren,1999), though only about a dozen are common enough to be considered important rock formers.|$|E
