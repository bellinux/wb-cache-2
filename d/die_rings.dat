The {{conventional}} and innovative surface technologies {{are applied to}} sheet metal stamping dies {{in order to produce}} a composite material with properties unattainable in either the base or surface material. To select proper materials for forming dies the systematic evaluation of dies materials, their heat treatment and coatings are required. This paper deals with evaluation of plasma sprayed coatings Cr 2 O 3, Al 2 O 3 and WC 12 Co by pressure plate-ring test (tester T 05) and deep drawing process. Friction coefficients and seizure of these coatings were studied under dry and wet friction conditions. For different types of <b>die</b> <b>rings</b> (with and without ceramic coatings) the punching forces were measured during deep-drawing process. The results show that the main advantage of application of plasma sprayed coatings on the die contact surfaces under wet friction conditions compare to dies made of the tool steel may be the increase of seizure resistance of stamped part surface. The more significant difference in the friction coefficient values was not observed...|$|E

A cutter on the other side of the die cuts the exposed pellet free from the <b>die.</b> In the <b>ring</b> <b>die</b> there are radial slot throughout the die. Powder is fed into the inside of the die and spreaders evenly distribute the powder. Two rollers then compress the powder through the die holes. Two cutters are used to cut the pellets free from the outside of the die.|$|R

40|$|In teenstelling met die faktorringe van Z (<b>die</b> <b>ring</b> van heelgetalle) wat goed bekend is, naamlik Z, { 0 } en Zn (<b>die</b> <b>ring</b> van heelgetalle modulo n), is dieselfde nie waar vir die homomorfe beelde van Z[i] (<b>die</b> <b>ring</b> van Gauss-heelgetalle) nie. Meer algemeen, laat m enige nie-nul kwadraatvrye heelgetal (positief of negatief) wees, en beskou die integraal-gebied Z[√m]= {a + b √m | a, b ∈ Z}. Watter ringe is homomorfe beelde van Z[√m]? Hierdie vraag bied aan studente ’n oneindige aantal ondersoeke (een vir elke m) wat slegs Whereas the {{homomorphic}} {{images of}} Z (the ring of integers) are well known, namely Z, { 0 } and Zn (the ring of integers modulo n), {{the same is}} not true for the homomorphic im-ages of Z[i] (the ring of Gaussian integers). More generally, let m be any nonzero square free integer (positive or negative), and consider the integral domain Z[√m]={a + b √m | a, b ∈ Z}. Which rings can be homomorphic images of Z[√m]? This ques-tion oﬀers students an inﬁnite number (one for each m) of investigations that require only undergraduate mathematics. It {{is the goal of}} this article to oﬀer a guide to the in-vestigation of the possible homomorphic images of Z[√m] using the Gaussian integers Z[i] as an example. We use the fact that Z[i] is a principal ideal domain to prove that if I =(a+bi) is a nonzero ideal of Z[i], then Z[i]/I ∼ = Zn for a positive integer n if and only if gcd{a, b} = 1, in which case n = a 2 + b 2. Our approach is novel in that it uses matrix techniques based on the row reduction of matrices with integer entries. By characterizing the integers n of the form n = a 2 + b 2, with gcd{a, b} = 1, we obtain the main result of the paper, which asserts that if n ≥ 2, then Zn is a homomorphic image of Z[i] if and only if the prime decomposition of n is 2 α 0 pα 1 1 ··· pαk k, with α 0 ∈{ 0, 1 },pi ≡ 1 (mod 4) and αi ≥ 0 for every i ≥ 1.

5000|$|This {{process is}} the same as a regular {{extrusion}} process up until the die. There are three main types of dies used in this process: annular (or crosshead), spider, and spiral. Annular dies are the simplest, and rely on the polymer melt channeling around the entire cross section of the die before exiting the die; this can result in uneven flow. Spider dies consist of a central mandrel attached to the outer <b>die</b> <b>ring</b> via a number of [...] "legs"; while flow is more symmetrical than in annular dies, a number of weld lines are produced which weaken the film. Spiral dies remove the issue of weld lines and asymmetrical flow, but are by far the most complex.|$|R

This thesis {{begins with}} a review (Chapter 1) of methodologies for carbon-carbon bond {{formation}} a to nitrogen of relevance to alkaloid synthesis, from which a specific structural motif for study in this thesis is identified. In {{the first phase of}} the research component (Chapter 2) relating to benzylic secondary aza stereogenic centres, a study has been undertaken of the stereoselective synthesis of tetrahydropyrido[2, 1 -a]isoindolones, via radical and carbanionic cyclisation of a Ntethered α-sulfanyl lactam incorporating an enoate ester as the acceptor and an allylic tertbutyldiphenylsilyloxy group (OTBDPS) as stereocontrol element. The product stereochemistries have successfully modelled the required cis-stereochemistry of the <b>DIE</b> <b>ring</b> fusion of the indole alkaloid tacamonine in which the pyrido and indolo rings of the natural product have been replaced by pyrrolo and phenyl respectively. The N-tether was constructed in a high-yielding sequence from (S) -malic acid. The radical cyclisation occurred with good diastereoselectivity, to afford of the four possible diastereomers, a major product(~ 50 %) with the hydrogens of the two new stereocentres in a cis relationship. Similarly the carbanionic cyclisation gave a major product in even higher diastereoselectivity (~ 80 %), which could be desulfurised with retention of configuration to give the other cis diastereomer. These results complement the radical approach, providing the required stereochemistry for the Tacaman alkaloid <b>DIE</b> <b>ring</b> fusion. A transition-state model is presented for the radical cyclisation in which the acceptor substituent adopts a pseudoaxial configuration in the transition-state as a result of the imposing steric effect of the OTB DPS group. This is in stark contrast to other 6 -exo-trig cyclisations in which the acceptor group is normally pseudoequatorial...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{outlines}} {{experimental work}} {{conducted to determine}} the influence of lubrication on the expansion of a <b>die</b> <b>ring</b> during the deep drawing of axisymmetrical steel cups. The work was conducted in order to determine if the die expansion could be used as an indirect means of detecting and measuring the presence of a hydrodynamic lubricant film thickness, or as a gauge of the product surface quality in the process. Any indications of the presence of a lubricant film in this manner would allow assessment of current theoretical models and provide a measurement for use in the control of a widely used deep drawing process. The surface finish and wall thickness of the cups produced during the experimental work were measured and evaluated to determine any correlation with the measured die expansion. In conjunction with the experimental work, FEA simulations were developed for the tooling, using values for the coefficient of friction based on the lubrication regime of the process. The results of this work show the significant differences in die expansion obtained with different lubricants. These results are compared with those produced with FEA, which produce similar trends. The results support the concept that die expansion could lead to the measurement of lubricating fluid film thickness and may be used in conjunction with the lubrication regime as an indicator of produced surface roughness for process control...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to extend the process limits of the {{mechanical}} joining technique self-pierce riveting in currently critical application scenarios such as the joining direction "thick in thin", the joining of cast aluminum with limited ductility and carbon fiber reinforced plastics {{as well as the}} combination of self-pierce riveting with adhesive {{through the use of a}} new die concept. Core of the new process variant is the separation of the die in a <b>die</b> <b>ring</b> and counter punch in which the counter punch is moved during the joining process. Through the use of the additional kinematics of the die tool significant improvements with respect to the joint quality compared to the conventional process can be achieved at all investigated application scenarios. Especially remarkable potential has the new process variant with separated die when joining materials with limited ductility. By the application of the force-controlled counter punch and the resulting additional superposition of the parts with compressive stresses, in contrast to the conventional self-pierce riveting, cracking in the parts can be avoided completely. In the numerical studies, a basic understanding of the new self-pierce riveting process was generated and the main influence factors on joint quality could be identified. The in the project realized, consistent comparison between the conventional and the new self-pierce riveting technique with respect to joint quality, joint strength and process-induced component deformation provides information on the advantages and disadvantages of the different self-pierce riveting technologies...|$|R
