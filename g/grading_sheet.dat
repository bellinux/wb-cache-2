40|$|Goals {{for student}} {{learning}} in Unit Operations Laboratory are diverse. Students are to develop {{skills in the}} planning and execution of experiments, the interpretation of experimental data, and the communication of technical information. Additional goals include gaining familiarity with process equipment, improving teamwork skills, and developing professional habits in safety, documentation, and planning. Each laboratory report grade represents an amalgamated assessment of students ’ progress towards all goals, so it cannot be used to assess progress towards any of them. Assessing student progress in our course is additionally complicated because students rotate through experiments supervised and graded by different professors. A criterion-based grading system, inspired by Walvood and Anderson’s Effective Grading: A Tool for Learning and Assessment, 1 was introduced at Ohio University. A standard <b>grading</b> <b>sheet</b> for all experiments specifies “traits ” indicative of progress towards each course goal (e. g., the student’s proposed test matrix indicates ability to design an experiment) and criteria for grading each trait. The purpose of the <b>grading</b> <b>sheet</b> is threefold: (1) Guide student learning by specifying the traits of a good laboratory report. (2) Improve consistency in grading and feedback to students by specifying the key traits to be considered. (3) Collect data to assess student progress towards course goals. Success in achieving the three-fold purpose is being evaluated via student surveys, conversations with faculty, and the assessment data provided by the grading instrument itself. The results of this evaluation {{are the subject of}} this presentation...|$|E

40|$|The Advanced Qualification Program {{requires}} that airlines evaluate crew performance in Line Oriented Simulation. For this evaluation to be meaningful, instructors must observe relevant crew behaviors and evaluate those behaviors consistently and accurately against standards {{established by the}} airline. The airline industry has largely settled on an approach in which instructors evaluate crew performance {{on a series of}} event sets, using standardized <b>grade</b> <b>sheets</b> on which behaviors specific to event set are listed. Typically, new instructors are given a class in which they learn to use the <b>grade</b> <b>sheets</b> and practice evaluating crew performance observed on videotapes. These classes emphasize reliability, providing detailed instruction and practice in scoring so that all instructors within a given class will give similar scores to similar performance. This approach has value but also has important limitations; (1) ratings within one class of new instructors may differ from those of other classes; (2) ratings may not be driven primarily by the specific behaviors on which the company wanted the crews to be scored; and (3) ratings may not be calibrated to company standards for level of performance skill required. In this paper we provide a method to extend the existing method of training instructors to address these three limitations. We call this method the "gold standards" approach because it uses ratings from the company's most experienced instructors as the basis for training rater accuracy. This approach ties the training to the specific behaviors on which the experienced instructors based their ratings...|$|R

50|$|Technical <b>grade</b> <b>sheet</b> mica {{is used in}} {{electrical}} components, electronics, in atomic force microscopy and as window sheets. Other uses include diaphragms for oxygen-breathing equipment, marker dials for navigation compasses, optical filters, pyrometers, thermal regulators, stove and kerosene heater windows, radiation aperture covers for microwave ovens, and micathermic heater elements. Mica is birefringent and is therefore commonly used to make quarter and half wave plates. Specialized applications for sheet mica are found in aerospace components in air-, ground-, and sea-launched missile systems, laser devices, medical electronics and radar systems. Mica is mechanically stable in micrometer-thin sheets which are relatively transparent to radiation (such as alpha particles) while being impervious to most gases. It is therefore used as a window on radiation detectors such as Geiger-Müller tubes.|$|R

Many educational data are relatively small {{in the sense that}} they contain less than a thousand student records.

40|$|Graded {{distributions}} of copper particles in ultrafine-grained aluminium sheets {{are produced by}} accumulative roll bonding and particle reinforcement. The metallic copper particles are sprayed on the sheet surfaces under variation of spray distance and/or relative velocity of the spray gun to the sheet.

After solutionizing, the successful gradation is clearly proven by tensile tests showing a steady and monotonous gradient along the rolling direction. By a systematic analysis of the spraying process, the particle content profile is calculated. Accuracy of the calculation is confirmed by electrical resistivity measurements.

Speci-mens with monotonically varying volume fraction of reinforcement {{are subjected to}} mixed-mode loading by eccentric impact relative to the crack plane. The optical method of Coherent Gradient Sensing and high-speed photography are used to map transient crack tip deformations before and after crack initi-ation. Two configurations, one with a crack on the stiffer side of a <b>graded</b> <b>sheet</b> and the second with a crack on the compliant side, are examined experimen-tally. To elucidate the differences in fracture behavior due to functional grading, a homogeneous sample is also tested. The differences in both pre- and post-crack initiation behaviors are observed in terms of crack initiation time, crack path, crack speed and stress intensity factor histories. When a crack is situated on the compliant side of the sample, it kinks significantly less compared to when {{it is on the}} stiffer side. Crack tip mode mixity histories show small but positive values during crack growth from the stiffer side of the sample towards the compliant side whereas a small but negative mode mixity prevails for the opposite configuration...|$|R
