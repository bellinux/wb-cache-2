30|$|Water shortages, {{including}} some {{that may have}} been caused by recent global climate change, have occurred more frequently in recent years in agricultural land, and have decreased crop production (Pennisi 2008). Under drought conditions, water remains disproportionately in the deep soil layers. The survival of most terrestrial plants under drought depends on the ability of their roots to obtain water, and <b>deeper</b> <b>rooting</b> appears to be an efficient strategy for avoiding drought stress because it enables a plant to absorb more water from these deep soil layers (Yoshida and Hasegawa 1982; Fukai and Cooper 1995; Rich and Watt 2013). Thus, <b>deeper</b> <b>rooting</b> is thought to be a key trait in the improvement of drought avoidance in crops (Fukai and Cooper 1995; Manschadi et al. 2006; Kirkegaard et al. 2007). To enhance a crop’s ability to avoid drought stress, therefore, the introduction of genes responsible for <b>deep</b> <b>rooting</b> into shallow-rooting cultivars is a promising breeding strategy. <b>Deep</b> <b>rooting</b> in cereal crops is determined by the combination of a large root growth angle (RGA; the angle between the soil surface and the shallowest primary root) and long seminal and nodal roots (Abe and Morita 1994; Araki et al. 2002). In particular, RGA determines whether a plant develops shallow or <b>deep</b> <b>rooting,</b> because RGA predetermines the dominant direction of root elongation.|$|R
