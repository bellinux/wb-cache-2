50|$|Unlike many {{gasworks}} {{sites in}} Australia that were either demolished or stripped after closure, the vertical retort house in Launceston still retained {{most of its}} original machinery after it was abandoned. Both the electric coke extractor eccentric and conveyor drive remained intact within the building along {{with most of the}} fourth floor machinery. The waste <b>heat</b> <b>boiler</b> on sublevel 3 had been reduced in size due to salvage operations in the 1980s as with the waste <b>heat</b> <b>boiler</b> on the first floor (ground level) which was also partially dismantled.

Original lighting and electronic equipment still remained within the building both on the first floor and the electrical room on the 3rd floor at the back of the building. The coke extractors on the underside of the retort blocks were in various levels of salvage with the most complete being located at the rear of the building.|$|E

50|$|A {{significant}} difference between the Mount Isa copper ISASMELT plant and all the others is that it uses an Ahlstrom Fluxflow® waste <b>heat</b> <b>boiler</b> to recover heat from the furnace waste gas. This boiler uses a recirculating fluid bed of particles to rapidly quench the gas as it leaves the furnace, and then uses the enhanced heat transfer properties of solid-solid contact to cool the particles as they are carried past boiler tubes that are suspended in a shaft above the bed. The high heat transfer rate means that the Fluxflow® boiler is relatively compact compared with conventional waste heat boilers and the rapid cooling of the waste gas limits the formation of sulfur trioxide ("SO3"), which in the presence of water forms sulfuric acid that can cause corrosion of cool surfaces.|$|E

5000|$|Enefit {{process is}} a {{modification}} of the Galoter process being developed by Enefit Outotec Technology. [...] In this process, the Galoter technology is combined with proven circulating fluidized bed (CFB) combustion technology used in coal-fired power plants and mineral processing. Oil shale particles and hot oil shale ash are mixed in a rotary drum as in the classical Galoter process. The primary modification is the replacing of the Galoter semi-coke furnace with a CFB furnace. The Enefit process also incorporates fluid bed ash cooler and waste <b>heat</b> <b>boiler</b> commonly used in coal-fired boilers to convert waste heat to steam for power generation. Compared to the traditional Galoter, the Enefit process allows complete combustion of carbonaceous residue, improved energy efficiency by maximum utilization of waste heat, and less water use for quenching. According to promoters, the Enefit process has a lower retorting time compare to the classical Galoter process and therefore it has a greater throughput. Avoidance of moving parts in the retorting zones increases their durability.|$|E
50|$|The former Great Southern and Western Railway class K3 2-6-0 {{locomotive}} number 356, {{built by}} the North British Locomotive Company as an 0-6-0 in 1903 and subsequently re{{built by the}} GS&WR, was converted into a testbed for the turf-burning project. Modifications to 356 included a new firebox, fitted with tuyeres, and two Crosti-type feedwater heaters, one {{on either side of}} the main boiler, which used heat from exhaust gases to <b>heat</b> <b>boiler</b> feedwater. Preheating coils were also located in the tender's water tank, and the chimney was positioned at the rear of the tender. Turf was fed to the firebox via an auger; there was no means of regulating this process. Steaming trials with the modified 356 began in 1952. Difficulties with steaming led to the addition of a forced-draught fan, which was mounted on a wagon behind the tender and driven by a Leyland bus engine. The results of trials with 356 were mixed, and the locomotive was broken up in 1957; however, some of the concepts were incorporated into CC1.|$|E
50|$|In June 2012 a {{proposal}} by developer Ross Harrison was put {{forward to the}} Launceston City Council to incorporate the Vertical Retort House and Carburetted Water Gas Building into a restaurant and bar with additional commercial space. In late July 2012, the site changed zoning from industrial to commercial and work commenced on cleaning {{the building of the}} accumulated pigeon droppings and polystyrene blocks that were dumped inside it. In mid-September removal of the Corrugated Asbestos Roofing started. On the 10 October 2012, the original 1932 machinery was blow-torched out of the building to be taken away followed by disassembly of the fire-brick retorts except for the coke extractors which were partially retained for aesthetic value. The completed works now link the two buildings with a glass atrium as the earlier proposal had intended. A bar and reception area are currently located on the 1st floor (ground level) of the Vertical Retort House under the former retort blocks with restaurant space occupying the area between the two buildings and into the Carburetted Water Gas Building. The upper levels of both buildings have been remodeled to support retail and office spaces. The machinery within the Vertical Retort House underwent a heritage survey to assess the historic value of the surviving equipment and from that, local architectural firm, ARTAS, was left to incorporate this into the final design. Removed machinery was intended to be kept as museum exhibits but has yet to be utilized for such purposes. At present all the machinery in the Vertical Retort has been removed except for a few components on the ground level and the waste <b>heat</b> <b>boiler</b> on the floors above, with salvaged components stored in the Horizontal Retort House.|$|E

5000|$|A World Bank {{modernisation}} {{grant was}} obtained in 1967, after the Cabinet Works Committee approved in February 1966, calling tenders for 55 1000-1200 hp locomotives for the South Island, and 34 of 1400-1600 hp, to complete North Island dieselisation. The expectation was that either General Motors, Canada offering, either its NZ standard DA/DB G8ML model engine and carbody for both Island, or its new G18LC late 1960s model, which it recommended [...] in both power ranges or English Electric DI design, were favored. 5 of the DI design were running on NZR {{and were the}} prototype for the Feb 1967 tender specifications for South Island steam replacement. But the order was placed with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan for 55 Bo-Bo-Bo diesel-electric locomotives, ( [...] Mitsubushi offering tenders 25-35% lower in cost than its main rivals,a unit cost of pounds 44,000 sterling, cf with GM 72,000,EE 70,000 and AEI 58,000 UK construction and 63,000 for Hybrid construction UK(24 loco) & Thames/Price AG(31 [...] )) with a complex and very advanced Bo-Bo-Ac design with silicon rectifiers. Both GM and English Electric were shocked to lose the South Island engine contract and the British [...] accused Mitsubushi of dumping with ridiculous below costing of an advanced, complex and experimental design. Following further discussions, the order was extended to 64 locomotives,on 27 Nov 1967, delivered between 1968 and 1969 along with twelve DSA class and three DSB class shunting locomotives. On arrival, the new locomotives received the next available classification of DJ. They were the first locomotives in New Zealand to employ an AC/DC transmission, all previous diesel locomotive types had DC/DC transmissions. They were also turbocharged rather like an early 1980s F1 car, max, 1050 hp rating, only safe for 5 minutes an hour, with operation at 975 hp for an hour on, and 835 hp for the next hour, but it took expensive experience to appreciate, boost power levels of 800hp plus, were not reliably sustainable, for all trip operation, such as the first passenger DJ express use on the 11hr run, summer SI Limited in 1969-70, when 2DJ pulled up to 14 cars[...] The order for the DJ was in two batches, 55 on 1 August 1966 [...] and the second delayed order of 9 on 1 November 1967 [...] while consideration was made how best to complete dieselisation on the West coast which had the best hard coal and on the heavy Passenger and express services on the SIMT for which the DJ lacked power. The initial tender for the SI diesels, had attracted offers which included diesel hydraulics from the Mitsubushi itself as an alternative offer, Hitachi and the German Export company, all three designs, variations essentially variations of BR Warship 42/43 design single engined, narrow gauged and single cab and without steam <b>heat</b> <b>boiler</b> to reduce from 82 tons to 64 tons and with similar Maybach engines and Mekhydro transmission or Man engines and Voith transmission. At the same weight power {{could easily have been}} doubled to the Warships 2200 hp to give 80 mph performance on the Southerner and much better hillclimbing than the French designed gas turbine train sets favoured for South Island expresses by the Minister of Railways Peter Gordon. Although the diesel hydraulic offers were 3 or the 4 lowest bid they rejected out of hand by the NZR staff who being dominated by electrical engines thought diesel hydraulics unsuitable for NZ. It had been intended to call full tenders for the last 9 engines in mid 1967, but Treasury suggested that the offer be restricted to Mitsubushi and the best 2 other DE offers to the first tender, but after unofficial discussion with World Bank staff, the last 9 were simply ordered direct from Mitsubushi because, the World Bank staff advised no other rail company would be able to deliver in the time and funding available {{for the remainder of the}} World Bank grant.|$|E
