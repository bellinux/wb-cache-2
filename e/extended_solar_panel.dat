40|$|Abstract –The shading {{pattern of}} a <b>Solar</b> <b>Panel</b> if {{analyzed}} helps {{to improve the}} performance of a <b>Solar</b> <b>panel.</b> Shades on top of a <b>Solar</b> <b>Panel</b> are one of the major factors which causes disturbance on a <b>solar</b> <b>panel.</b> This paper helps analyze the shading on a <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> which is caused by steady clouds. This may help to increase the efficiency of a <b>solar</b> <b>panel.</b> Various methods of Image processing technique is used to get the desired output. Those methods include techniques like median filtering and various morphological functions like usage of structuring element which gives the desired output. The problem of Boundary Estimation of a shading patter on a <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> is addressed. Short-time shading and lightning is not at all useful for solar power plant. If the <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> is shaded then proper measures have to be taken to keep the efficiency intact else there would be a serious loss in the amount of current generated {{with the help of a}} <b>solar</b> <b>panel.</b> Here the pixel values are measured and thus the exact numbers of dark and bright pixels are calculated and even the pixel values are reconfigurated to get the correct boundary estimation. The bypass diode is used to bypass the shaded area on the panel, which in turn helps to increase the efficiency of a <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> by a significant amount. This method takes care of processing all kinds of shade on the <b>solar</b> <b>panel</b> from whatever source the shade is generated from.
