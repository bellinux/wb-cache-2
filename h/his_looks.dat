For his role, he had to undergo a training phase at the gym and study the character of Milkha Singh by researching his body language. He also had to prepare <b>his</b> <b>looks</b> to depict a 17-year-old army recruit and endure an on-the-spot preparation at an army cantonment. In 2014, Akhtar acted for the romantic comedy Shaadi Ke Side Effects alongside Vidya Balan, a film directed by Saket Chaudhary and produced by Pritish Nandy.

5|$|The filming was {{supposed}} to begin in August 2009. However, due to the slow progress of Karthi's ongoing project, Aayirathil Oruvan, Paiyaa was postponed several times, since Karthi needed to maintain the continuity of <b>his</b> <b>looks</b> {{for his role in}} Aayirathil Oruvan. Its producer Ravindran complained at the Tamil Film Producers Council that Karthi was trying to change his look and move on to Paiyaa before finishing his commitments, which forced Linguswamy to readjust the schedules. The shooting finally began in December 2008. The film's music was released in November 2009 along with the trailer. In late 2009, after finishing the filming of Paiyaa, Lingusamy disclosed his plans of remaking the film in Telugu and Hindi as well. Later, as Yuganikki Okkadu, the Telugu dubbed version of Karthi's Aayirathil Oruvan, emerged as successful in Andhra Pradesh, the team instead decided to dub and release the film in Telugu to cash in on Karthi's new-found popularity in the state. The Telugu version was titled Awara and its audio was released in March 2010; Awara was released simultaneously with the Tamil version. In March 2010, the film's distribution rights were acquired by Dhayanidhi Alagiri's Cloud Nine Movies.|$|E
25|$|Stig: His {{nickname}} {{may come}} from the term stigma, as he is marked an outsider for his notable lack of hygiene. Stig is the last member to be initiated into this generation of the Midnight Society. As such, he has only two stories in the series before the cast is changed. Due to the aversion people seem to have against him for <b>his</b> <b>looks,</b> both his stories seem to revolve around outsiders judged for their appearances and tastes.|$|E
25|$|During {{his playing}} career, Bunton was {{considered}} by {{fans of the}} sport as a player of integrity, who rarely if ever engaged in unduly rough play. His fame was enhanced by him having his own radio show on 3DB, and a Melbourne newspaper column, when he played with Fitzroy. He later had radio programs in Perth and Adelaide. He {{was regarded as a}} sex symbol in the 1930s, and <b>his</b> <b>looks</b> were compared to those of film star Rudolf Valentino.|$|E

25|$|In 1980, Mohanlal {{was cast}} in the lead {{antagonist}} role in Manjil Virinja Pookkal – the directorial debut of Fazil. The film became a major success. Mohanlal's friends had sent his application {{in response to an}} advertisement released by Navodaya Studio. He auditioned for the role in front of a panel that included professional directors. Displeased with his appearance, two of them gave him poor marks but Fazil and Jijo Appachan gave him 90 and 95 marks out of 100. In an interview with Reader's Digest in 2004, Mohanlal said that <b>his</b> <b>looks</b> as a young man might have fit the villain's image.|$|E
25|$|After he regains {{his body}} in the fourth book, Rowling {{describes}} Voldemort as having pale skin, a chalk-white, skull-like face, snake-like slits for nostrils, red eyes and cat-like slits for pupils, a skeletally thin body and long, thin hands with unnaturally long fingers. As mentioned in {{the first chapter of}} the seventh book, he also has no hair or lips. Earlier in life, as seen through flashbacks contained in the second and sixth books, Tom Marvolo Riddle was handsome and tall with pale skin, jet black hair, and dark brown eyes. He could charm many people with <b>his</b> <b>looks.</b> The transformation into his monstrous state {{is believed to have been}} the result of creating his Horcruxes and becoming less human as he continued to divide his soul. In the films, Voldemort's eyes are blue with round pupils.|$|E
25|$|Ignis' {{personality}} {{was designed}} to be expressed in both <b>his</b> <b>looks,</b> the way he spoke, and his gestures. His role as the party's cook came about when considering which among them would be most likely to take up that duty. His cooking skills are explained in-game to exchanges with Noctis during their early lives. Out of the main cast, Ignis went through the least changes despite the technological improvements during the shift between Versus XIII and Final Fantasy XV. To reflect his position as Noctis's protector from a young age, he was made to look more toned and his musculature was developed, particularly around the neck. Care was taken to retain his intellectual look. As {{with the rest of the}} party, he is dressed in black due to its specific significance to the Lucian royal family. For Ignis' English version, Inoue wrote him to be a suave and logical character like a younger version of James Bond or Sherlock Holmes.|$|E

500|$|Fleming biographer Andrew Lycett noted that, [...] "within {{the first}} few pages [...] Ian had {{introduced}} most of Bond's idiosyncrasies and trademarks", which included <b>his</b> <b>looks,</b> his Bentley and his smoking and drinking habits.

500|$|McCann {{notes that}} one of the reasons that Grant was so {{successful}} with his film career is that he was not conscious of how handsome he was on screen, acting in a fashion which was most unexpected and unusual from a Hollywood star of that period. George Cukor once stated: [...] "You see, he didn't depend on <b>his</b> <b>looks.</b> He wasn't a narcissist, he acted as though he were just an ordinary young man. And that made it all the more appealing, that a handsome young man was funny; that was especially unexpected and good because we think, 'Well, if he's a Beau Brummel, he can't be either funny or intelligent', but he proved otherwise". Jennifer Grant acknowledged that her father neither relied on <b>his</b> <b>looks</b> nor was a character actor, and said that he was just the opposite of that, playing the [...] "basic man".|$|E
500|$|Although James Bond {{is in his}} mid-to-late thirties, he {{does not}} age in Fleming's stories. Fleming biographer Andrew Lycett noted that, [...] "within the first few pages [...] Ian had {{introduced}} most of Bond's idiosyncrasies and trademarks", which included <b>his</b> <b>looks,</b> his Bentley and his smoking and drinking habits: Bond's penchant for alcohol runs throughout the series of books and he smokes up to 70 cigarettes a day.|$|E

500|$|The late 2000s saw Lautner {{become a}} teen idol and sex symbol, after {{extensively}} changing his physique {{to keep the}} role of Jacob Black in further Twilight installments, and generating media attention for <b>his</b> <b>looks.</b> In 2010, he was ranked second on Glamours [...] "The 50 Sexiest Men of 2010" [...] list, and fourth on Peoples [...] "Most Amazing Bodies" [...] list. Also in the same year, Lautner was named the highest-paid teenage actor in Hollywood.|$|E
500|$|When Vadivelu's {{character}} Kuzhandaivelu {{is injured}} in Middle Class Madhavan (2001), Revathi Sankaran, who plays his in-law in the film, sings [...] "Nalandhana" [...] while enquiring about his health. In Perazhagan (2004), when hunchback Chinna (Suriya) talks about improving <b>his</b> <b>looks,</b> Kuzhandaisamy (Vivek) jokes that if Chinna {{was given a}} party horn to play with, he would look like 'Sikkal' Shanmugasundaram. Scenes from Thillana Mohanambal [...] were parodied in Thamizh Padam (2010). The film's poster depicts lead actor Shiva as Ganesan's character, Shanmugasundaram and M. S. Bhaskar as Balaiah's character, Muthurakku.|$|E
500|$|Nicknamed the [...] "Black Prince" [...] {{because of}} his tanned skin, Toshack's looks and sense of humour made him a crowd favourite, as did his {{theatrical}} appealing, which was more reminiscent of later eras of cricketers. His vocal appealing prompted the journalist and former Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton to dub him [...] "The Voice", while teammate Sid Barnes called him [...] "The film star" [...] because of <b>his</b> <b>looks.</b> His sense of fun was often on show. While on the 1948 tour, he would often wear a bowler hat, grab a furled umbrella, and place a cigar in his mouth, parodying an Englishman.|$|E
5000|$|He {{was called}} [...] "Mad Dog' because of <b>his</b> <b>look</b> a like to Mad Dog Vachon.|$|R

500|$|Watched by {{more than}} 30million viewers weekly during its three-year run, The Sonny & Cher Comedy Hour was praised for the comedic timing, and deadpan Cher mocked Sonny about <b>his</b> <b>looks</b> and short stature. According to Berman, they [...] "exuded an aura of warmth, playfulness, and caring that only {{enhanced}} their appeal. Viewers were further enchanted when a young Chastity also appeared on the show. They seemed like a perfect family." [...] Cher honed her acting skills in sketch comedy roles such as the brash housewife Laverne, the sardonic waitress Rosa, and historical vamps, including Cleopatra and Miss Sadie Thompson. The Bob Mackie designed clothing Cher wore {{was part of the}} show's attraction, and her style influenced the fashion trends of the 1970s.|$|E
500|$|During the 2015 [...] "Secret Wars" [...] storyline, {{a version}} of Spider-Woman appears in the plot of A-Force. This version resides on the Battleworld domain of Arcadia. The {{character}} saves Mary Jane Watson during an invasion of the Marvel Zombies after Arcadia's Loki had fired at {{the part of the}} Shield that was closest to Arcadia. Furthermore, a child version of Spider-Woman appears in Giant Size Little Marvel: AVX as a new child that Tony Stark tries to ask out on a date; she rejects him because of <b>his</b> <b>looks.</b> In the Ultimate Spider-Man animated series, she appears as a denizen of the show's version of the Ultimate Universe, while on Earth-8, Spider-Gwen is married to Miles Morales and is the mother of Charlotte and Max Morales, both of whom also have Spider Powers.|$|E
500|$|Fleming {{decided that}} Bond should {{resemble}} both the American singer Hoagy Carmichael and himself, {{and in the}} novel Lynd remarks that [...] "Bond reminds me rather of Hoagy Carmichael, {{but there is something}} cold and ruthless." [...] According to Andrew Lycett, Fleming's biographer, [...] "within the first few pages... had introduced most of Bond's idiosyncrasies and trademarks", which included <b>his</b> <b>looks,</b> his Bentley and his smoking and drinking habits. The full details of Bond's martini were kept until chapter seven of the book and Bond eventually named it [...] "The Vesper", after Lynd. Bond's order, to be served in a deep champagne goblet, was for [...] "three measures of Gordon's, one of vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well until it's ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon peel." ...|$|E
