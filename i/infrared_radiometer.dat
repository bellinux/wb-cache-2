5|$|Ava {{was also}} {{underneath}} the NOAA-2 and Nimbus 5 weather satellites. NOAA-2 provided photographs {{that were used}} to estimate Ava's maximum windspeeds. Satellite images were useful throughout the cyclone's existence, as did the wind reports of three ships when Ava was a young tropical storm. Nimbus 5 carried an Electrically Scanning Microwave Radiometer and Temperature-Humidity <b>Infrared</b> <b>Radiometer.</b> Both were used to study Ava. The main data provided by the THIR was data indicating cloud temperatures. The ESMR's main data was on rainfall rates, densities, and distributions. The observations also provided confirmation that clouds that are not vertically developed very much can produce tropical rainfall.|$|E
2500|$|Measurements of Martian {{temperature}} predate the Space Age. However, early instrumentation {{and techniques}} of radio astronomy produced crude, differing results. Early flyby probes (Mariner 4) and later orbiters used radio occultation to perform aeronomy. [...] With chemical composition already deduced from spectroscopy, temperature and pressure {{could then be}} derived. [...] Nevertheless, flyby occultations can only measure properties along two transects, at their trajectories' entries and exits from Mars' disk as seen from Earth. [...] This results in weather [...] "snapshots" [...] at a particular area, at a particular time. [...] Orbiters then {{increase the number of}} radio transects. Later missions, starting with the dual Mariner 6 and 7 flybys, plus the Soviet Mars 2 and 3, carried infrared detectors to measure radiant energy. [...] Mariner 9 was the first to place an <b>infrared</b> <b>radiometer</b> and spectrometer in Mars orbit in 1971, along with its other instruments and radio transmitter. [...] Viking 1 and 2 followed, with not merely Infrared Thermal Mappers (IRTM). [...] The missions could also corroborate these remote sensing datasets with not only their in situ lander metrology booms, but with higher-altitude temperature and pressure sensors for their descent.|$|E

50|$|The <b>infrared</b> <b>radiometer</b> {{showed that}} the 8.4 μm and 10.4 μm {{radiation}} temperatures were in agreement with radiation temperatures obtained from Earth-based measurements. There was no systematic difference between the temperatures measured on the light side and {{dark side of the}} planet, which was also in agreement with Earth-based measurements. The limb darkening effect that the microwave radiometer detected was also present in the measurements by both channels of the <b>infrared</b> <b>radiometer.</b> The effect was only slightly present in the 10.4 μm channel but was more pronounced in the 8.4 μm channel. The 8.4 μm channel also showed a slight phase effect. The phase effect indicated that if a greenhouse effect existed, heat was transported in an efficient manner from the light side to {{the dark side of the}} planet. The 8.4 μm and 10.4 μm showed equal radiation temperatures, indicating that the limb darkening effect would appear to come from a cloud structure rather than the atmosphere. Thus, if the measured temperatures were actually cloud temperatures instead of surface temperatures, then these clouds would have to be quite thick.|$|E
