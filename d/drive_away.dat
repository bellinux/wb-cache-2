5|$|American crows are {{protected}} internationally by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. Despite attempts by humans {{in some areas}} to <b>drive</b> <b>away</b> or eliminate these birds, they remain widespread and very common. The number of individual American crows is estimated by BirdLife International to be around 31,000,000. The large population, {{as well as its}} vast range, are the reasons why the American crow is considered to be of least concern, meaning that the species is not threatened.|$|E

5|$|Males of fly {{species such}} as Cuterebra, many hover flies, bee flies (Bombyliidae) and fruit flies (Tephritidae) {{maintain}} territories within which they engage in aerial pursuit to <b>drive</b> <b>away</b> intruding males and other species. While these territories may be held by individual males, some species form leks with many males aggregating in displays. Some flies maintain an airspace and still others form dense swarms that maintain a stationary location with respect to landmarks. Many flies mate in flight while swarming.|$|E

The Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota is a 75-minute <b>drive</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E

In {{addition to its}} song, the American robin {{has a number of}} calls used for communicating specific information such as when a ground predator approaches, and when a nest or robin is being directly threatened. Even during nesting season, when robins exhibit mostly competitive and territorial behavior, they may still band together to <b>drive</b> <b>away</b> a predator.|$|E

5|$|You {{have more}} to do than simply abstain from riotous proceedings. You must not stand behind riots and let violators of the law promote the {{destruction}} of property.

5|$|Healthy {{adults do}} not have many predators, but human {{activities}} pose many threats. Collisions with power lines, hunting, intentional poisoning, lead accumulation from ingesting gunshot in carcasses, and pesticide accumulation take a toll on populations. Young birds at the nest are sometimes taken by golden eagles, eagle owls, and red foxes. Only rarely do adult birds attempt to <b>drive</b> <b>away</b> predators. Young birds that fall off of cliff ledges may be preyed on by mammalian predators such as jackals, foxes and wolves. Like all birds they serve as hosts for ectoparasitic birdlice including Aegypoecus perspicuus as well as organisms that live within them such as mycoplasmas.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, Air Norway lost 1,300 {{passengers}} {{after the}} Norwegian Air Force {{decided to not}} permit their employees to travel from Ørland, but instead have to take cheaper flights from Trondheim, located about a two-hour <b>drive</b> <b>away.</b> The reduction in ridership, along with a strengthening of the Danish krone {{in relation to the}} Norwegian, caused Air Norway to lose NOK100,000 by August 2009. The mayor of Ørland stated at that he was working to make the route receive state grants as a PSO. In February 2010, the municipality granted NOK62,500 for Air Norway to run a television commercial during the semi-final of Melodi Grand Prix.|$|E

5|$|Pontiac's War has {{traditionally}} been portrayed as a defeat for the Native Americans, but scholars now usually {{view it as a}} military stalemate: while the Native Americans had failed to <b>drive</b> <b>away</b> the British, the British were unable to conquer the Native Americans. Negotiation and accommodation, rather than success on the battlefield, ultimately brought an end to the war. The Native Americans had in fact won a victory of sorts by compelling the British government to abandon Amherst's policies and instead create a relationship with the Native Americans modeled on the Franco-Native alliance.|$|E

Some sections of the Monkland Canal can still be seen today between Townhead and Drumpellier. Coatbridge is adjacent to the M8 and M73 motorways.

5|$|To counter this threat, the Admiralty {{developed}} the fighter catapult ship a converted freighter, manned by a naval crew, carrying a single Hawker Hurricane fighter. When an enemy bomber was sighted, the fighter would be launched {{into the air}} with rockets, and fly up to destroy or <b>drive</b> <b>away</b> the bomber. Being large and slow, the Fw 200 became a rather vulnerable target. After the combat, the fighter pilot would bail out or ditch in the ocean near the convoy, and be picked up if all went well.|$|E
