5|$|A {{moderate}} risk {{of severe}} storms was {{issued by the}} Storm Prediction Center for February28 across parts of the central Plains. The first tornadoes developed <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> of February28 in Kansas as the dry line pushed eastward and was lifted by the cold front. In total, 12 tornadoes formed that evening across Kansas and Missouri, of which 11 were weak. However, one of the tornadoes was an EF4, the first such tornado recorded and the first violent tornado since September22, 2006. No one was injured that evening. Farther south, expected activity in Oklahoma and Arkansas {{did not take place}} as the atmospheric cap held up.|$|E
5|$|<b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> of 31 December 1965, Dacko {{left the}} Palais de la Renaissance to visit {{one of his}} minister's {{plantations}} southwest of the capital. At 22:30WAT (UTC 21:30), Captain Banza gave orders to his officers to begin the coup; one of his subordinates was to subdue the security guard in the presidential palace, while the other was {{to take control of}} Radio-Bangui to prevent communication between Dacko and his followers. Bokassa called Izamo at his headquarters, asking him to come to Camp de Roux to sign some papers that needed his immediate attention. Izamo, who was at a New Year's Eve celebration with friends, reluctantly agreed and traveled in his wife's car to the camp. Upon arrival, he was confronted by Banza and Bokassa, who informed him of the coup in progress. After announcing his refusal to support the coup, Izamo was overpowered and locked in a cellar.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese had {{developed}} the position considerably, establishing a complex defensive network and, whereas {{up until that}} point they had usually withdrawn {{in the face of}} the advancing Australians, they decided to make a stand. Employing a 75mm gun, which was fired over open sights due to the closeness of the fighting, along with some 37mm guns and a number of machine guns of varying calibre, they fought fiercely. Halted by fire, the Australians called in fire support to overwhelm the Japanese with fire superiority, and resorting to employing the indirect method that would characterise their operations during this phase of the advance, and which was necessitated by the depleted state of their forces. Moving up a steep slope that was covered by kunai grass, one of the tanks broke down, nevertheless the Australian armour was able to deliver a significant bombardment which enabled the infantry to take the position <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{subsequent}} push inland towards Carpiquet and the Caen–Bayeux railway line achieved mixed results. The {{sheer numbers}} {{of men and}} vehicles on the beaches created lengthy delays between the landing of the 9th Brigade {{and the beginning of}} substantive attacks to the south. The 7th Brigade encountered heavy initial opposition before pushing south and making contact with the British 50th Division at Creully. The 8th Brigade encountered heavy resistance from a battalion of the 716th at Tailleville, while the 9th Brigade deployed towards Carpiquet <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening.</b> Resistance in Saint-Aubin prevented the Royal Marines from establishing contact with the British 3rd Division on Sword. When all operations on the Anglo-Canadian front were ordered to halt at 21:00, by which time The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada had reached its D-Day objective, and the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division had succeeded in pushing farther inland than any other landing force on D-Day.|$|E
5|$|Twelve-year-old Keith Bennett {{vanished}} {{on his way}} to his grandmother's {{house in}} Longsight, Manchester, <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> of 16 June 1964, four days after his birthday. Hindley lured him into her Mini Pick-up—which Brady was sitting in the back of—by asking for the boy's help in loading some boxes, after which she said she would drive him home. She drove to a lay-by on Saddleworth Moor as she and Brady had previously arranged, and Brady went off with Bennett, supposedly looking for a lost glove. Hindley kept watch, and after about 30minutes or so Brady reappeared, alone and carrying a spade that he had hidden there earlier. When Hindley asked how he had killed Bennett, Brady said that he had sexually assaulted the boy and strangled him with a piece of string.|$|E
5|$|The highest {{promoted}} match, {{second only}} to the main event in importance, scheduled for Victory Road was between the tag team pairings of America's Most Wanted (Chris Harris and James Storm) (AMW) and Triple X (Christopher Daniels and Elix Skipper) (XXX), with them competing in an Elimination Last Team Standing match. In this match, the teams fought each other until both members of one team could not stand up before the referee counted to ten. The build up to this match began on the previous weekly PPV, when Storm was not cleared to wrestle so XXX took AMW's place in challenging for the NWA World Tag Team Championship. Daniels was injured <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> after a scripted assault by The Naturals (Andy Douglas and Chase Stevens). Harris was written into the plotline to replace Daniels in challenging and defeating The Naturals for the tag team championship at the PPV. On the September 24 episode of Impact!, Daniels and Storm were forced to team together and challenge Skipper and Harris for the championship, which they were successful in winning. Storm and Daniels later lost the championship to Team Canada (Bobby Roode and Eric Young) on the October 15 episode of Impact!. Harris and Storm then re-joined together to continue as AMW, while Daniels and Skipper did the same as XXX. After a few brawls between the two teams on Impact!, AMW challenged XXX to a Last Team Standing match at Victory Road on the October 29 episode of Impact!.|$|E

25|$|The species Mastophora hutchinsoni preys {{exclusively}} on the males of a few moth species. Its major prey is Lacinipolia renigera. A study by K.F. Haynes (University of Kentucky) showed that the spider adapts to the change in prey availability: One prey species flies from the early evening until 10:30pm, the other only after 11:00pm. The first moth ignores the pheromone of the second, so the spider produces a mix of both pheromones <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening.</b> However, since the second moth is repulsed by the other moth's pheromone, the spider ceases to produce the first pheromone later at night.|$|E
25|$|<b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> of March 31, 1865, Union V Corps commander, Major General Gouverneur K. Warren, {{recognized}} {{from the}} sound of battle that Sheridan's cavalry was being pushed back at Dinwiddie Court House and sent Brigadier General Joseph J. Bartlett's brigade to reinforce Sheridan. Moving cross country, Bartlett's men drove Confederate pickets from Dr. Boisseau's farm, just east of Crump Road. Since the Gravelly Run bridge on the Boydton Plank Road had been wrecked by the Confederates, Pearson was delayed. At about 8:20p.m., Warren told Meade about the needed bridge repair and possible delay but Meade did not pass the information to Sheridan.|$|E

25|$|<b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening,</b> {{more than}} six hours after the explosion, Kursk failed to {{complete}} a scheduled communication check at 18:00. The Northern Fleet command became concerned and tried to contact Kursk. After repeated failures, at 18:30 they began a search and rescue operation, dispatching aircraft to locate the submarine, which again failed to locate the ship on the surface. At 17:00, an Ilyushin 38 aircraft was dispatched and looked for Kursk for three hours without spotting anything. At 22:30, the Northern Fleet declared an emergency, and the exercise was stopped. Between fifteen and twenty-two vessels of the Northern Fleet, including about 3,000 sailors, began searching for the submarine. Captain Teslenko commanding Mikhail Rudnitsky left port at 00:30.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} morning, Kilroy and {{his friends}} had {{more or less a}} daily routine in mind. They went to the beach in the morning and suntanned before lunch. After lunch they went to the beach area behind their hotel for a daily Miss Tanline contest. Once the event was over that afternoon, Kilroy headed to the hotel for a quick nap before planning their trip to Mexico. They left South Padre Island that evening and stopped for dinner at a Sonic Drive-In in Port Isabel, Texas, where they met a group of female students from University of Kansas who were planning to party in Mexico as well. The girls then followed Brent's car from Port Isabel to Brownsville and parked their cars close to the Gateway International Bridge before crossing the U.S.-Mexico border by foot. Kilroy's friends and the Kansas girls spent most of their evening at Sergeant Pepper's night club in Matamoros before the groups went their separate ways. Kilroy {{and his friends}} then returned to South Padre Island early the next morning. On March 13, Kilroy and his friends attended another Miss Tanline contest behind the Sheraton. <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening,</b> Kilroy met with one of his former frat brothers at a condo party. At around 10:30p.m. CT, Kilroy and his friends headed back to Matamoros. They parked on the border and crossed by foot again.|$|E
500|$|The {{result was}} a {{landslide}} for Dilworth. In an election with higher than expected turnout, the Democrat took 59% of the vote, a slight increase over the party's tally from the mayoral contest of four years earlier.

Þrymr finds the behaviour {{at odds with}} his impression of Freyja, and Loki, sitting before Þrymr and appearing as a [...] "very shrewd maid", makes the excuse that [...] "Freyja's" [...] behaviour is due to her having not consumed anything for eight entire days before arriving due to her eagerness to arrive. Þrymr then lifts [...] "Freyja's" [...] veil and wants to kiss [...] "her". Terrifying eyes stare back at him, seemingly burning with fire.

500|$|<b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening,</b> Voyager had no {{difficulties}} maintaining {{her position}} during the manoeuvres both ships performed. Following {{a series of}} turns intended to reverse the courses of both ships beginning at 8:40pm, Voyager ended up to starboard of Melbourne. At 8:52pm, Voyager was ordered to resume the plane guard station. The procedure to accomplish this required Voyager {{to turn away from}} Melbourne in a large circle, cross behind the carrier, then take position off Melbournes port side. Instead, Voyager first turned to starboard, away from Melbourne, then turned to port without warning. It was initially assumed by Melbournes bridge crew that Voyager was conducting a series of tight turns to lose speed before swinging behind Melbourne, but Voyager did not alter course again. At 8:55pm, with Voyager approaching, Melbournes navigator ordered the carrier's engines to half astern speed, with Robertson ordering an increase to full astern a few seconds later. At the same time, Stevens, having just become aware of the situation, gave the order [...] "Full ahead both engines. Hard-a starboard.", before instructing the destroyer's Quartermaster to announce that a collision was imminent. Both ships' measures were too late to avoid a collision; Melbourne hit Voyager at 8:56pm.|$|E
500|$|Following Beryl's formation, {{there was}} a {{receding}} trough over New England that initially created a weak steering environment. Marginally warm waters and dry air were expected to prevent significant intensification, and convection remained minimal through May26. Later that day, a building ridge caused Beryl to begin a steady southwest motion. By that time, the low-level center became vertically aligned with the upper-level center. The environment near the storm's center became moister and the system began to pass over warmer sea surface temperatures, allowing convection to increase. On May27, the storm began to transition into a tropical cyclone, which it completed by 1800UTC that day. As Beryl approached northeastern Florida, it became better organized, with increased convection in bands around the center. Late on May27, the Hurricane Hunters observed flight-level winds of , suggesting maximum sustained winds of 70mph (110km/h); this would be Beryl's peak intensity. It is possible, however, that Beryl briefly reached hurricane intensity <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> of May27 based on Doppler radar velocities, although the data is inconclusive according to the post-season report. At roughly 0410UTC on May28, the storm made landfall near Jacksonville Beach, Florida, with winds of about [...] after weakening slightly on the final approach.|$|E

500|$|The {{night of}} June 11–12, 1920 would become famous in {{political}} {{history as the}} night of the [...] "smoke-filled room", in which, legend has it, party elders agreed to force the convention to nominate Harding. Historians have focused on the talks held in the suite of Republican National Committee (RNC) Chairman Will Hays at the Blackstone Hotel, at which senators and others came and went, and numerous possible candidates were discussed. Utah Senator Reed Smoot, before his departure <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening,</b> backed Harding, telling Hays and the others that as the Democrats were likely to nominate Governor Cox, they should pick Harding to win Ohio. Smoot also told The New York Times that there had been an agreement to nominate Harding, but {{that it would not be}} done for several ballots yet. This was not true: a number of participants backed Harding (others supported his rivals), but there was no pact to nominate him, and the senators had little power to enforce any agreement. Two other participants in the smoke-filled room discussions, Kansas Senator Charles Curtis and Colonel George Brinton McClellan Harvey, a close friend of Hays, predicted to the press that Harding would be nominated because of the liabilities of the other candidates.|$|E
500|$|Early on {{the morning}} of February 5, a squall line {{developed}} across eastern Texas northward into Missouri and moved east towards the high risk area. Ahead of the squall line, the cap took longer than expected to break, but when it finally did in the late afternoon hours, numerous supercell thunderstorms quickly formed across Arkansas and southern Missouri. The first tornadoes touched down around 3:30 pm CST (2130 UTC). A cap is a layer of relatively warm air aloft (usually several thousand feet above the ground) which suppresses or delays the development of thunderstorms; the cap often prevents or delays thunderstorm development even in the presence of extreme instability. However, if the cap is removed or weakened, then explosive thunderstorm development can occur. Some of the most powerful tornado-producing supercells were situated across the Memphis and Jackson areas, as well as central Arkansas (one producing a tornado that tracked 122 miles (196km) and lasted about two hours) between 5:00 and 7:30 pm CST (2300 to 0130 UTC) while numerous other tornadoes were reported across northern Mississippi northwest of Tupelo, Mississippi, <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening.</b> As the evening progressed, one of these supercells traveled across Middle Tennessee including the Nashville metropolitan area and south-central Kentucky, where several deadly tornadoes were reported during the evening hours between 7:30 pm and 11:00 pm CST (0130 to 0500 UTC) ...|$|E
500|$|Harding {{went to bed}} <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>evening</b> of July 27, 1923. Later that night, {{he called}} for his physician, Charles E. Sawyer, {{complaining}} of pain in the upper abdomen. Sawyer {{thought it was a}} recurrence of a dietary upset, but Dr. Joel T. Boone suspected a heart problem. The next day, as the train rushed to San Francisco, Harding felt better, and when they arrived on the morning of July 29, 1923, he insisted on walking from the train to the car, which rushed him to the Palace Hotel where he suffered a relapse. Doctors found that not only was Harding's heart causing problems, but he also had pneumonia, a serious matter in the days before effective antibiotics. When treated with caffeine and digitalis, Harding seemed to improve. He was pleased when his planned foreign policy address advocating membership in the World Court was released to the press by Hoover and received a favorable reception. By the afternoon of August 2, 1923, doctors allowed Harding to sit up in bed. That evening, about 7:30 pm, he was listening to his wife read him a flattering article about him from The Saturday Evening Post, [...] "A Calm Review of a Calm Man". When she paused to plump his pillows, he said, [...] "That's good, read some more". As Florence Harding resumed, her husband twisted convulsively and collapsed, and she raced to get the doctors. They attempted stimulants, but were unable to revive him, and President Harding {{died of a heart attack}} on August 2, 1923, at the age of 57. His death was initially attributed to a cerebral hemorrhage, as doctors at the time did not generally understand the symptoms of a heart attack.|$|E
