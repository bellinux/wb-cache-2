The factors affecting the colour generation were optimized and incorporated in the procedure. The reacted propofol has a molar absorptivity of 3. 9 × 10 – 4 l/mol cm, and Beer's law is obeyed for concentrations 1 - 5 µg/ml with detection limit 0. 25 µg/ml. The method was found applicable to biological fluids (plasma and urine) spiked with propofol at concentration levels 1 - 5 µg/ml for plasma and 1 - 5 µg/ 0. 5 ml urine (less sensitivity is obtained with urine volumes above 0. 5 ml) with detection limits 0. 28 µg/ml for plasma and 0. 4 µg 0. 5 ml urine. The average recovery for the commercial preparation (1 % w/v propofol <b>emulsion</b> intravenous injection <b>for</b> <b>infusion)</b> was 99. 54 % with an RSD of 1. 05 %. The method was validated by an adopted HPLC method. The results obtained by the HPLC method for the commercial preparation were statistically compared with the proposed method and evaluated at the 95 % confidence limits...|$|R
40|$|Intravenous lipid {{emulsion}} is an established, {{effective treatment}} for local anesthetic-induced cardiovascular collapse. The predominant theory for its {{mechanism of action}} is that by creating an expanded, intravascular lipid phase, equilibria are established that drive the offending drug from target tissues into the newly formed ‘lipid sink’. Based on this hypothesis, lipid emulsion has been considered a candidate for generic reversal of toxicity caused by overdose of any lipophilic drug. Recent case reports of successful resuscitation suggest the efficacy of lipid <b>emulsion</b> <b>infusion</b> <b>for</b> treating non-local anesthetic overdoses across {{a wide spectrum of}} drugs: beta blockers, calcium channel blockers, parasiticides, herbicides and several varieties of psychotropic agents. Lipid emulsion therapy is gaining acceptance in emergency rooms and other critical care settings as a possible treatment for lipophilic drug toxicity. While protocols exist for administration of lipid emulsion in the setting of local anesthetic toxicity, no optimal regimen has been established for treatment of acute non-local anesthetic poisonings. Future studies will shape the evolving recommendations <b>for</b> lipid <b>emulsion</b> in the setting of non-local anesthetic drug overdose...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: In {{order to}} {{identify}} methods for preventing phlebitis caused by intravenous administration of vinorelbine (VNR), we established a procedure for estimating the severity of phlebitis in an animal model. Methods: Four different factors (administration rate, dilution, flushing, and infusion of fat <b>emulsion)</b> were evaluated <b>for</b> alleviation of phlebitis caused by VNR infusion. VNR was diluted with normal saline to prepare test solutions with concentrations of 0. 6 mg/mL or 0. 3 mg/mL <b>for</b> <b>infusion</b> into the auricular veins of rabbits. Two days after VNR infusion, the veins were subjected to histopathological examination. Results: VNR did not cause obvious loss of venous endothelial cells, the most sensitive and common feature of phlebitis, but VNR infusion led to inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, and epidermal degeneration. Tissue damage was significantly decreased by shortening the administration time and by diluting the VNR solution <b>for</b> <b>infusion</b> from 0. 6 mg/mL to 0. 3 mg/mL. However, there was no effect of flushing with normal saline after VNR infusion, while treatment with fat emulsion before and after VNR infusion only had a minimal effect. Conclusion: Rapid infusion and dilution are effective methods of reducing phlebitis caused by the infusion of VNR, but the efficacy of flushing with normal saline or infusion of fat emulsion was not confirmed. </p...|$|R
