He arrived in New York City on 2 April 1698. Bellomont's stylish dress, good looks, and positive relationship with the king predisposed New Yorkers to like him, but he very quickly ran into difficulties and began making enemies.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of the {{nomination}} speech, Howe and Roosevelt planned that the latter would run for <b>Governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> in 1932 and President in 1936. However, Governor Smith was named the Democratic presidential candidate in 1928, and persuaded the state convention to draft Roosevelt. Howe predicted disaster, feeling that a Republican challenger was sure to beat Roosevelt in what was expected to be nationally a Republican year. Though Howe remained Roosevelt's unofficial campaign manager, he was technically subordinate to a state campaign manager selected by Smith, as well as Smith's personal campaign manager, Belle Moskowitz, with whom Howe frequently clashed. In the fall election, Roosevelt won the governorship by a small margin, though Smith was defeated by Herbert Hoover both nationally and in New York State.|$|E
5|$|During {{a congressional}} recess in July 1878, Hayes finally sacked Arthur and Cornell (Sharpe's term had expired) and {{appointed}} replacements. When Congress reconvened, Sherman pressured his former Senate colleagues {{to confirm the}} President's replacement nominees, which they did after considerable debate. Jay and other reformers criticized Sherman the next year when he traveled to New York to speak on Cornell's behalf in his campaign for <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> Sherman replied {{that it was important}} that the Republican party win the election there, despite their intra-party differences. His friendliness may also have related, as Arthur's biographer Thomas C. Reeves suggests, to a desire to keep Conkling's New York machine friendly to him as the 1880 presidential election approached.|$|E

50|$|In 1702, the two provinces were reunited under a royal governor, {{rather than}} a {{proprietary}} one. Edward Hyde, Lord Cornbury, became the first <b>governor</b> <b>of</b> the colony as a royal colony.

New Jersey was then ruled by the <b>governors</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> <b>York,</b> but this infuriated the settlers <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Jersey, who accused those <b>governors</b> <b>of</b> favoritism to <b>New</b> <b>York.</b> Judge Lewis Morris led the case for a separate governor, and was appointed governor by King George II in 1738.|$|R
