40|$|In this thesis, a {{prototype}} automated disassembly system {{was developed for}} the disposal of end-of-life electronics. The system was designed to handle a family of electronic devices whose plastic, cantilever snap-fit covers house AA or AAA batteries. Examples of these devices {{included in the study}} were a TV remote control and a TI- 84 scientific calculator. The main focus of the prototype system was the design of an automated <b>disassembly</b> <b>tool</b> with the ability to remove the snap-fit cover and the batteries contained within. The design concept conceived to release the snap-fit and the batteries was a force sensing tool tip utilizing force sensing resistors (FSRs). The sensor feedback from the FSRs was used to control the movement of the tool during disassembly operations. A pneumatically actuated vacuum gripper and electromagnet system was developed for recovering the snap-fit cover and batteries once they were released by the <b>disassembly</b> <b>tool.</b> The disassembly module was mounted on the tool head of a three-axis translational motion robot. A Visual Basic GUI was developed to interface and control the robot with a Galil digital motion controller. The Visual Basic application was used to program an automated disassembly routine for the removal of the snap-fit cover and batteries. A model-based computer vision application was also developed in Visual C++ using a Kinect sensor and the OpenCV library to identify and localize the electronic device placed on the disassembly robot. The information gathered by the model-based computer vision application was used by the robot to load the necessary device parameters and compute the snap-fit and battery coordinates.

Static disassembly is a crucial prerequisite for software reverse engineering, and has many applica-tions in computer security and binary analysis.

While standard static and dynamic approaches suffer from well-known shortcomings, Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) has recently been proposed has an interesting alternative, more robust than static analysis and more complete than dynamic analysis. Yet, DSE addresses certain kinds of questions encountered by a reverser namely feasibility questions. Many issues arising during reverse, e. g. detecting protection schemes such as opaque predicates fall {{into the category of}} infeasibility questions. In this article, we present the Backward-Bounded DSE, a generic, precise, efficient and robust method for solving infeasibility questions.

The rising {{number of}} lithium ion {{batteries}} from electric vehicles makes an economically advantageous and technically mature disassembly {{system for the}} end-of-life batteries inevitable. The disassembly system needs {{to cope with the}} size, the design and the remaining state of charge of the respective battery system. The complex design resulting from the number and type of connection elements challenges an automated disassembly.

40|$|Oligonucleotides {{are popular}} recognition-based {{biomaterials}} assembly and <b>disassembly</b> <b>tools</b> {{due to their}} specificity and ease of control. Their susceptibility to degradation by nucleases and false positive signals under certain conditions, however, has led to great interest in chemically modified oligonucleotides such as locked nucleic acids (LNA) that enhance both nuclease resistance and target specificity. This dissertation extends prior work with DNA sequences to investigate incorporating locked nucleic acid (LNA), a synthetic oligonucleotide, in isothermal colloidal assembly and disassembly schemes {{as well as on}} hybridization kinetics between single-stranded and double-stranded probes immobilized on microspheres. Incorporation of LNA nucleotides into DNA sequences is of particular interest as a means of enhancing the performance of DNA in a biomaterials context due to the increased resistance of LNA to nuclease degradation, its greater intrinsic affinity for oligonucleotide targets, and low cytotoxicity effects. The effects of LNA modification, target sequence length, sequence fidelity, and salt concentration are key variables explored. After providing an overview of DNA and its properties, synthetic oligonucleotides, colloidal particles, and previous applications of DNA and LNA in colloidal assembly schemes, this work then discusses the selection and characteristics of appropriate pairs of hybridization partners for reversible colloidal assembly scenarios. A comparative investigation of the in situ primary hybridization kinetics between select LNA or DNA targets and single-stranded probes immobilized on colloidal surfaces is performed. To support the disassembly studies, the in situ competitive displacement kinetics of hybridized LNA primary targets by either LNA or DNA secondary targets is discussed. For these in situ studies, flow cytometry was used to quantify the hybridization reactions as they occur on microsphere surfaces. While comparable rate constants were typically observed between target and single-stranded probes, LNA typically exhibited more extensive primary and secondary hybridization activity. Optimizing hybridization parameters, such as duplex concentration, sequence fidelity, and LNA content in the probe and target strands, allows for the extent of colloidal disassembly to be tuned, an important step in developing a multifunctional colloid-based biomaterial system.

40|$|Disassembly of {{products}} at their end-of-life {{is an important}} topic, since the general objective of product recycling {{is to increase the}} amount of parts recovered and reused while minimizing the amount of disposal. In addition, materials have to be recovered and recycled, subsequently. In general, disassembly can be defined as a systematic method for non-destructively separating a product into its constituent parts, subassemblies or other groupings. In general, disassembly is a prerequisite for recycling or remanufacturing, since most products should be disassembled before being recycled or remanufactured as secondary parts or materials. Among the various decision problems in a disassembly process, this thesis focuses on the disassembly process planning, which is the problem of determining the sequence of disassembly operations for a given product and <b>disassembly</b> <b>tools</b> under certain objective function such that the resulting sequence satisfies the constraints established by the product. A deterministic disassembly sequencing method is developed using two kinds of graph based disassembly sequence representations, i. e. extended process graph and modified directed graph of assembly states; the problem is solved using integer and linear programming formulation, respectively. The graphs represent not only the operation sequences, but also sequence-dependent operation times, which should be considered as direct labor costs, since most disassembly operations are done manually and processing times are affected by the order of operations due to the tool changing. The last part of the thesis deals with the uncertainty issues, e. g. defective parts or joints in an incoming product, disassembly damage, and imprecise net profits and costs. Among those, imprecise net profits and costs are mainly of interest in this thesis. Practically, it is quite often that the estimated disassembly operation time and the expected value of a component or material can only be obtained in a rough range. In other words, the profit values are given in the form of intervals that correspond to ranges in which the true coefficient values lie. The problem considered in this thesis can be transformed into a linear programming problem with interval objective function coefficients. Then, in order to solve the problem, the minmax regret approach is applied, which transforms the multi-objective decision making problem into a problem with a single objective, and a dynamic programming algorithm is developed to compute the minimum worst case deviation (robust deviation) between alternative solution paths as an exact solution approach...|$|R
40|$|Product {{life cycle}} (PLC) is the cycle which every product goes through from {{introduction}} to eventual demise. There are several {{issues with the}} current life cycle of a product when looked from the environmental impact perspective. These are: 1) depletion of natural resources due {{to the use of}} virgin materials for production, 2) Consumption of substantial amounts of energy during manufacturing, assembly and use, and 3) production of large amounts of waste during the lifecycle including those at the End of Life (EoL) phase. These issues impact resource scarcity, adverse effects on the environment and loss of embodied energy as waste. Some of the potential solutions to these issues, as proposed in literature, are: to recycle, reuse and remanufacture products in order to reclaim materials, components and sub-assemblies from used products and make them available for new products. In order to efficiently carry out these recovery processes, a pre-requisite is disassembly. Product disassembly is defined as the processes of systematic removal of desirable constitute parts from an assembly while ensuring that there is no impairment of the parts due to the disassembly process. The following are the major research issues in the field of disassembly. One is the conflict between environmental and economic goals, i. e. as to which should be targeted at in disassembly objectives. These conflicts lead to abandoning non-destructive disassembly techniques so as to favour the profit objective. The other issues, prevalent during EoL phase, are: corrosion due to use, less residual value in the parts, complicated structure and intricacy in parts, which together make non-destructive disassembly a task difficult for automation. This means that disassembly processes have to be carried out by human operators. The manual disassembly processes are effort intensive and pose ergonomic risks to the human operators involved in disassembling. The nature of ergonomic risks and effort spent in disassembly is influenced by the efficiency of disassembly operation. However, little research has been carried out to address the above factors of effort, profit, efficiency, environment and ergonomic risk during disassembly in an integrated manner. These factors form the major motivations for the research work carried out in this thesis. A series of empirical studies have been undertaken to assess these factors and their impact on product disassembly. The studies focus on disassembly processes for consumer electronic products in two major recycling sectors in developing countries, leading to development of metrics with which the above factors can be assessed individually and traded off in an integrated manner during the early design stages of a product. These metrics should help designers understand and improve the major disassembly aspects of a product during designing and help prevent major disassembly problems at the EoL phase while improving efficiency of recovery options. The objective of this thesis, therefore, is to develop an Integrated Framework for supporting decision making during early stages of design to improve disassembly during the EoL phase of the product. The framework is intended to help in evaluating alternative designs for easy (less effort), profitable, efficient and environment-friendly disassembly at the EoL phase of the product life cycle. The Framework constitutes new measures developed for supporting decision making on above aspects of disassembly during the early stage of designing. The Framework has been implemented into a computer based tool called ‘IdeAssemble’ and evaluated for its functionality {{with the help of a}} design experiment. The tool can be used at the embodiment stage of the design phase, when on an exploded view of the product, with information on its materials, geometry, <b>disassembly</b> <b>tools</b> and types of disassembly task are available to the designer...|$|R

In this context, disassembly is a crucial task in malware analysis and reverse engineering. It involves the recovery of assembly instructions from binary machine code. Correct disassembly of binaries is necessary to produce a higher level representation of the code and thus allow the analysis to develop high-level understanding of its behavior and purpose.

40|$|This {{report has}} been {{developed}} within the project “Technical support for Environmental Footprinting, material efficiency in product policy and the European Platform on LCA” (2013 - 2016) funded by Directorate General Environment, {{and focused on the}} development of a standardisable method with a verifiable metric to assess the reversible disassembly of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE). The main motivation of this study was the need for a robust method to evaluate the ability to access or remove certain components from products to facilitate their repair, reuse or recycling. Such a method is developed to serve different purposes, such as product design optimization, compliance to policies and end-of-life treatment improvement. Such a work is particularly relevant to the 2015 Circular Economy action plan that will “promote reparability, upgradability, durability and recyclability of products” through Ecodesign Directive and to the mandate addressed to European standardisation organisations in 2015 to develop standards on material efficiency of energy related products (ErP). The report provides a scientific background, with the review of current methods available in the literature, which were grouped into: 1) methods to categorise manual operations and disassembly actions and 2) methods to calculate the ease of disassembly of products. Based on the presented literature review, the proposed method focused on the identification of relevant product parameters and disassembly actions to be used for the calculation of a disassembly index. In particular, the authors have identified six basic and relevant disassembly actions of an average <b>disassembly</b> process: 1) <b>Tool</b> change, 2) Identifying connectors, 3) Manipulation of the product, 4) Positioning, 5) Disconnection and 6) Removing. For each of them, and for each type of fastener, a table of reference values was determined. Successively, an innovative disassembly index has been proposed and named as “ease of Disassembly Metric” (eDiM). Given a product and the sequence of actions to disassemble it, the eDiM calculation consists of associating a value of the reference table to each of these actions. The summation of these values finally results in the eDiM for the considered product and disassembly sequence. The eDiM index assesses the effort needed to completely or partially disassemble a product. The index is also representing an estimation of the time necessary for the disassembly and therefore it is expressed in standards unit of measurement for time (seconds). The eDiM index was tested on a 14 ” flat panel monitor (LCD), a small electronic device with a weight of 2. 6 kg that can be disassembled on a workbench. The eDiM was calculated for the complete disassembly and also for the selective extraction of certain components, as the Printed Wiring Boards. The calculated values were also compared to the disassembly performed by a professional operator, in order to measure the possible deviations. Considering the complete disassembly, the comparison between calculated eDiM and measured values resulted in a limited difference (the calculated eDiM was 8. 5 % higher than the measured value), with the largest deviation observed for the disassembly action of “Identifying connectors”. Based on {{the results of the present}} analysis, the authors positively concluded on the feasibility to develop a robust and potentially standardisable method to assess the ease of disassembly of EEE. The method is based on information about the product composition and fastening that can be directly verified on the product. Authors also concluded that the proposed method is suitable to support product design for disassembly and policies for ecodesign.  JRC. H. 8 -Sustainability Assessmen...|$|R
