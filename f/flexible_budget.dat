Furthermore, the second condition depicts that the utilization is also decreased {{in the case}} that resource over-provisioning occurred, i.e., {{only a small part}} of reserved resource is utilized. In summary, the more appropriate amount of budget that we can allocate just to meet the actual requirement of an application, the more the resource utilization is increased and vice-versa. The constraints (2) and (3) are corresponding to bandwidth usage constraints for reserved and <b>flexible</b> <b>budgets,</b> i.e., usage must be bounded by the proportionately allocated amount for an application i at a given time cycle t. The constraint (4) states that the constraints (2) and (3) follow additive rule. However, increasing the reserve budget for an application does not always increase the utilization. The resource utilization is enhanced when the gap between the reserved amount and the usage amount is decreased. Similarly, excessive allocation of <b>flexible</b> data <b>budget</b> amount for a certain application might cause penalty to some other applications, degrading the overall resource utilization. We use a popular mathematical programming language AMPL [38] for solving the optimization problem.

A <b>flexible</b> <b>budget</b> had to be created and tied to the department's current productivity standards. This included determining which job codes should be fixed and which should fluctuate with volume. An analysis then had to be performed, to measure the benefits of the new system, against the older, fixed budget system. The analysis was divided into three categories: revenue, labor expenses, and material and services expenses. Although the analysis was only performed on two months of data, the results showed that this type of budget was very worthwhile.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{study examines}} {{the relationship between}} degree of financial autonomy and spending patterns of public higher education institutions on research-related activities versus instruction-related activities. As state appropriations have been decreasing and student enrollment has been increasing, higher education institutions have become more financially autonomous from states.

The main finding(s) are the positive relationship between lesser reliance on state funding, more-diversified revenue sources and full authority over tuition-setting, and higher spending on research-related activities versus instruction-related activities, in particular for research universities. In turn, comprehensive institutions with the most <b>flexible</b> <b>budgeting</b> approach tend to spend more on instruction than research.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide an insight into {{budgetary}} practice in UK-based hotel organizations and an update on previous survey work in this area. The research aims to cover a broad range of budgeting issues, including: the process used in setting budgets, monitoring and review of the budgetary processes, and the human aspects of the budgeting process. Design/methodology/approach – This research used a census-based questionnaire of hotel organizations' finance directors. The questionnaire consisted of mainly closed questions, with opportunities for further explanation to be given. Statistical analysis tools included Chi-square tests, Spearman's Rank Coefficient, and ANOVA. Findings – The paper finds that the key reason organizations produce budgets are to aid control, evaluate performance and aid planning. Neither the top-down, bottom-up or combination approaches to budgeting dominated in the UK. The results showed a higher rate of the top-down approach in the UK, compared to previous surveys in other countries. Budgets were generally viewed as the main performance indicator in hotel organizations. There is little use of <b>flexible</b> <b>budgeting,</b> budget committees or budget manuals in the hotel industry. The “human aspects” of budgeting identified some interesting contradictions such as the belief that participation is key in budgeting working, yet there is a lack of participation in practice, most significantly amongst hotel department managers. Originality/value – Limited information as to budgetary practice in hotels has previously been published, particularly related to the UK.

Under the plausible assumption that the past success of sourcing options influences member organizations' future resource allocation, the model indicates that the additional buffer stock capacity offered by horizontal cooperation induces undesirable system dependency: while it gives member organizations more flexibility to meet highly stochastic demands under uncertainty, it also encourage them to store less of their own relief goods as a result.
