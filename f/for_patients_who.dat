5|$|Many {{brachytherapy}} {{procedures are}} performed on an outpatient basis. This convenience {{may be particularly}} relevant <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> have to work, older patients, or patients who live some distance from treatment centres, {{to ensure that they}} have access to radiotherapy treatment and adhere to treatment plans. Shorter treatment times and outpatient procedures can also help improve the efficiency of radiotherapy clinics.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} initial {{course of the}} disease is the relapsing-remitting subtype, which is {{characterized}} by unpredictable attacks (relapses) followed by periods of relative remission with no new signs of disease activity. After some years, {{many of the people}} who have this subtype begin to experience neurologic decline without acute relapses. When this happens it is called secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Other, less common, courses of the disease are the primary progressive (decline from the beginning without attacks) and the progressive-relapsing (steady neurologic decline and superimposed attacks). Different therapies are used for patients experiencing acute attacks, <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> have the relapsing-remitting subtype, <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> have the progressive subtypes, for patients without a diagnosis of MS who have a demyelinating event, and for managing the various consequences of MS.|$|E

5|$|Car/SUV – Used {{either as}} a fly-car for rapid {{response}} or <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> can sit, these are standard car models adapted {{to the requirements of}} the service using them. Some cars are capable of taking a stretcher with a recumbent patient, but this often requires the removal of the front passenger seat, or the use of a particularly long car. This was often the case with early ambulances, which were converted (or even serving) hearses, as {{these were some of the}} few vehicles able to accept a human body in a supine position.|$|E
5|$|Continuous Care is {{a service}} {{provided}} in the patient's home. It is <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> are experiencing severe symptoms and need temporary extra support. Once a patient is on continuous care, the hospice provides services in the home a minimum of eight hours a day. Because the criteria for continuous care is similar to general inpatient care, and due to the challenges a hospice can face with staffing extended day care in the home, continuous care {{is intended to be}} used for short periods of time.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiological {{studies of}} {{serotonin}} syndrome are difficult as many physicians {{are unaware of}} the diagnosis or they may miss the syndrome due to its variable manifestations. In 1998 a survey conducted in England found that 85% of the general practitioners that had prescribed the antidepressant nefazodone were unaware of serotonin syndrome. The incidence may be increasing as {{a larger number of}} pro-serotonergic drugs (drugs which increase serotonin levels) are now being used in clinical practice. One postmarketing surveillance study identified an incidence of 0.4 cases per 1000 patient-months <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> were taking nefazodone. Additionally, around 14 to 16 percent of persons who overdose on SSRIs are thought to develop serotonin syndrome.|$|E

5|$|If it is {{determined}} {{at the time}} of review that a patient's prognosis may be greater than six months, the patient is de-certified (discharged) from hospice. The hospice is required by law to give advance notification to the patient, and the patient can appeal the hospice's decision to Medicare. Usually the hospice plans these discharges weeks in advance to make the transition off hospice, which can be traumatic <b>for</b> <b>patients</b> <b>who</b> have been preparing to die, as smooth as possible. Should the patient's condition worsen once discharged from hospice they can be readmitted to hospice.|$|E
