2500|$|In {{addition}} to damages {{for not getting}} the thing promised itself, a contract breaker must compensate for the costly consequences of the breach that one would reasonably expect to exist. There must be a causal connection between the breach and the consequence complained of. In Saamco v York Montague Ltd it was held a bank could not recover damages from property valuer {{for all of the}} difference in what the properties it bought after getting the valuations were assured to be and actual property values, because {{a large part of the}} difference resulted from generally depressed market prices following [...] "Black Wednesday" [...] in 1992. In a business deal, calculation will typically be based on the forgone profits that one could reasonably have expected to make. This could also include the [...] "loss of a chance" [...] to profit, so in Chaplin v Hicks an entrant in a beauty contest wrongfully excluded from the final round was awarded 25% of the final prize money to reflect her 1 in 4 chance of having won. One limit lies at consequential losses that are too [...] "remote", or are not a natural result of the breach, and are not in the parties' contemplation. In Hadley v Baxendale a miller tried to recover damages from Baxendale's delivery company for the lost profits from his mill grinding to a halt, after they were late delivering a crankshaft back from being fixed. But Alderson B held that because millers would usually be expected to keep spare crank shafts, and because he had not informed Baxendale of the importance of the timely delivery, an award for profits could not be compensated. More recently in The Achilleas the majority of the House of Lords preferred to express the remoteness rule as one of construing the contract to reflect the parties' [...] "background of market expectations". Transfield Shipping returned The Achilleas late to its owner, Mercator, which led Mercator to lose a lucrative contract with Cargill that would make over $1.3million, an occurrence that was plainly a natural consequence of the breach and easily foreseeable. Yet because the standard practice and expectation in the shipping industry was that if a ship were returned late only the ordinary sum for hire would be due, this was the limit on recovery. It is also possible to lose one's <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> <b>damages</b> if steps are not taken to mitigate further losses, that any prudent person would, rather than sitting back and letting losses run up. But the burden of proof of a failure to mitigate is on a contract breaker, to whom the courts are unlikely to be sympathetic. A contract breaker could may also, if a concurrent liability arises in tort, argue a claimant's damages should be reduced to reflect their contributory fault, and the courts can reduce an award to achieve a just and equitable result. Sometimes potential profits will be too uncertain, or a general fall in market prices means that even claiming damages for the thing itself would leave one in a negative position, and so the courts allow a claimant to choose whether to sue, not for a failure in expectations, but to cover her expenses in preparing for the contract, or the [...] "reliance interest". In Anglia Television Ltd v Reed a TV channel successfully sued Robert Reed for not turning up for shooting a film. It was unclear whether the film would make any profits at all, and so Anglia TV got compensated for its wasted expenses in preparing the set. The level of damages is generally assessed at the date of the breach, but this is variable if the court thinks another time would be fairer.|$|E

50|$|Chief Justice Burger dissented the ruling, {{joined by}} Justices Powell and Rehnquist. In his dissent, Justice Burger stated that a foreign nations <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> bring <b>damage</b> actions in U.S. courts against {{domestic}} suppliers for alleged violations of antitrust laws was never considered when the Sherman and Clayton Acts were enacted, {{and that the}} Clayton and Sherman acts did not extend the right of person-hood to foreign powers.|$|R
40|$|Since the Federal Circuit’s {{adoption}} of Panduit’s causation standard for establishing <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> lost profits <b>damages</b> in patent litigation, application of its noninfringing alternatives prong has lacked consistency. The court’s decision in Grain Processing Corp. v. American Maize-Products Co., however, created an additional {{contribution to the}} Panduit standard, thereby raising the evidentiary bar while significantly altering the noninfringing-alternative inquiry. Grain Processing has given the infringer a potentially powerful defensive mechanism in {{an area in which}} patentees are generally favored, even when some infringement may be socially desirable. Grain Processing allows for the potential avoidance of lost profit damages, so long as the alleged infringer shows that it had the necessary equipment, know-how, and experience to produce an acceptable, noninfringing substitute during the alleged infringement period. The Grain Processing decision, however, raises some debate. As a judicially interjected gloss on damages, the added ability <b>to</b> limit <b>damage</b> awards <b>to</b> a reasonable royalty could have been too drastic. A closer look demonstrates a precarious policy balance. On the one hand, increases in patent litigation might justify implementing an additional hurdle <b>to</b> potential <b>damage</b> awards in order to further incentivize innovation. Added rigor provided by Grain Processing may deter frivolous and expensive litigation that might be asserted by patentees to keep new innovators out of the market. But on the other hand, if a market participant does unlawfully infringe, it is certainly reasonable to believe that the infringer should pay appropriate damages for the encroachment on another’s intellectual property. Grain Processing’s lost-profit-limiting defense against a patentee’s claim of <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> lost profits <b>damages</b> may serve <b>to</b> deter potentially useful innovation by increasing costs shouldered by patentees in defending their patent rights. This Note analyzes six Federal Circuit cases appealing lost profits determinations, decided both before and after Grain Processing, and attempts to discern the impacts that Grain Processing has had on patentees’ <b>entitlements</b> <b>to</b> lost profits. This Note is organized in four parts. Part I provides the historical and substantive context necessary to understand the Grain Processing decision and examines important statutory changes, especially their subsequent interpretation, both before and after Grain Processing. Part II summarizes three pre-, as well as three post-Grain Processing cases. Parts III and IV dissect and analyze the holdings in these cases and evaluate Grain Processing’s impact on patent damages...|$|R

5000|$|Even {{though the}} {{district}} court granted Finjan additional damages by multiplying the jury’s royalty rates against previously uncalculated sales, the period was limited “to only those additional infringing sales that occurred up until {{the date of entry}} of the judgment in this case.” Finjan therefore claimed <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> <b>damages</b> for the 17-month period between the entry of the judge (March 28, 2008) and the injunction (August 28, 2009).|$|E
5000|$|Under the English sale {{of goods}} principles, a {{condition}} is a term whose breach entitles the injured party to repudiate the contract, but a breach of warranty shall give rise only to damages. In this case, Diplock LJ proposed that some terms could lead either {{to the right to}} terminate a contract as a remedy, or to the mere <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> <b>damages</b> (without a right to terminate). What mattered was not whether a particular contract term was called a [...] "warranty" [...] or a [...] "condition", but how serious was the breach of the term.|$|E
50|$|A {{remarkable}} {{example of}} the objective approach to interpreting a contract is found in Thake v Maurice. A couple were assured by a private doctor that Mr Thake's vasectomy would work. They were not explicitly informed {{there was a small}} risk of it not working. They had a healthy child. They sued Dr Maurice (and his clinic) for damages to pay for bringing up the child, arguing that his failure to properly perform the operation was a breach of contract which had resulted in great financial burden for them. But the Court of Appeal held that there was no <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> <b>damages</b> because a reasonable person knows that there is inherent risk in medical operations, and the chance it could go wrong (now compare Chester v Afshar in tort law). A reasonable person knows that people providing services contract to provide the service, but do not necessarily guarantee the outcome of the service will be fool proof.|$|E

50|$|Sir George Jessel MR {{held that}} Mr Hurd’s {{counterclaim}} for fraudulent misrepresentation failed {{because there was}} no plea that Mr Redgrave knew his statements were untrue. Therefore, there was no <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> <b>damages.</b> Nevertheless, Fry J’s decision was reversed, and the contract was rescinded on grounds of innocent misrepresentation. He held that relying on the representation was enough and there was no duty to inspect the papers. For rescission, he noted the difference of law (knowledge was necessary) and equity, where the approach was ‘A man is not to be allowed to say… that when he made it he did not know it to be false; he ought to have found that out before he made it’ and ‘no man ought to seek to take advantage of his own false statements’. If a man is induced to enter a contract by a false representation it is not a sufficient answer to him to say, ‘If you had used due diligence you would have found out that the statement was untrue. You had the means afforded you of discovering its falsity, and did not choose to avail yourself of them... If it is a material representation calculated to induce him to enter into the contract, it is an inference of law that he was induced by the representation to enter into it’ and so it is for the person alleging otherwise to show it.|$|E

40|$|The {{main idea}} {{of this paper is}} that the witness {{protection}} is a subjective, public right and is a result of protection of fundamental human rights. It is fundamental, public, individual, positive, directly relative and indirectly absolute right. The following entitlements stem from the fundamental right of witness <b>to</b> protection: a) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> be informed about one’s right <b>to</b> protection; b) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> demand or waive one’s right <b>to</b> protection; c) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> withhold one’s personal details, testimony in full or answers to particular questions until the decision is made as to his request for protection; d) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> two-instance decision on one’s request; e) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> have a proxy; f) <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> enjoy protection. The analysis of procedural witness protection in the comparative law shows that the witness in some countries does not have certain entitlements. On the other side, some entitlements are generally recognized. Certain differencies are understandable and acceptable, but not all of them. It is necessary to work on the realization of all entitlements that can be derived from subjective right to witness protection.

40|$|On stock markets, {{there are}} {{regularly}} (at least) two different information sets: The set determining {{the market price}} {{is not necessarily the}} same as the one being available to the entity’s management. If the management has the ability to influence the first one, it consequently has the possibility to manipulate the market price. It is sought for conditions under which the general premises of civil law for shareholders’ <b>entitlement</b> <b>to</b> <b>damages</b> are fulfilled taking into consideration an economic capital market theory. Hereby, the first premise is the existence of a damage. The second premise is the damage being caused by the liable party. The prove of the premises is incumbent on the plaintiffs. The fraud on the market-theory facilitates the prove of the first premise: Instead of proving that the investor relied directly on the manipulative statement (or concealment) of the management, it is sufficient to prove that he relied on the integrity of the (manipulated) market price. The fraud on the market-theory obviously influences the conditions sought after. U. S. courts have already accepted the theory in the 1970 ’s. But not until 1987, the application of the theory was confirmed by the Supreme Court: A chemical company denied negotiations with a competitor about a merger, thereupon shareholders sold their stocks. However, in spite of the denial, the success of the negotiations was announced just a few weeks later and the market price rose. The shareholders claimed for damages resulting from the artificially deflated market price {{at the time of their}} selling. The Supreme Court judged: “Because most publicly available information is reflected in market price, an investor’s reliance on any public misrepresentations […] may be presumed. ” Though this presumption was made in order to streamline securities fraud litigation, the Supreme Court also (implicitly) demanded the verification of the derived theoretical conditions. ...|$|E
