5|$|Sheila {{was found}} {{on the floor of the}} master bedroom with her mother. She was in her nightdress, <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> bare, and she had two bullet wounds under her chin, one of them on her throat. The pathologist, Dr Peter Vanezis, said that the lower of the {{injuries}} had occurred from three inches (76mm) away, and that the higher one was a contact injury. The higher of the two would have killed her immediately. The lower injury would have killed her too, he said, but not necessarily straight away. Vanezis testified that it would be possible for a person with such an injury to stand up and walk around, but the lack of blood on her nightdress suggested to him that she had not done this. He believed that the lower of her injuries had happened first, because it had caused bleeding inside the neck; the court heard that if the immediately fatal wound had happened first, the bleeding would not have occurred to the same extent. Vanesiz said that the pattern of bloodstains on her nightdress suggested she had been sitting up when she received both injuries.|$|E

500|$|In November 2008, {{shortly after}} the Olympic {{trampoline}} trials, 15-year-old Mortimer missed the sponge pit after bouncing on a mini-trampoline and fell [...] onto a concrete pad; her parents, spectators at the competition, saw the accident. The bones in <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> shattered, and doctors suggested {{that she would never}} stand again. Amputation was a possibility, although Mortimer was only informed of it in 2011.|$|E
500|$|Kean {{was born}} 27 February 1987. [...] When she was two, <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> amputated due to {{meningococcal}} septicaemia. She is nicknamed Bird because her friend Kate Dunstan {{in high school}} {{thought it was funny}} that her name sounded like Bird. Then, when she moved to the United States, her friends struggled to pronounce her first name correctly – it rhymes with [...] "tidy" [...] – when she was living there. [...] And so, the nickname stuck. Her hometown is Parkdale, Victoria. An award in Kean's honour, acknowledging qualities of compassion and bravery, is each year presented to a student at Kilbreda College, where she went to school. , she [...] lives in Alexandra Headland, Queensland.|$|E
500|$|Marshal Hański died in 1841, and {{his widow}} and her admirer finally {{had the chance}} to pursue their affections. A rival of the Hungarian {{composer}} Franz Liszt, Balzac visited Countess Hańska in St. Petersburg in 1843 and won her heart. After a series of financial setbacks, health problems and objections from Tsar Nicholas I, the couple finally received permission to wed. On 14 March 1850, with Balzac's health in serious decline, they travelled by carriage from her family seat at [...] Park in Volhynia to St. Barbara's Catholic Church in Berdychiv (Russia's former banking city in present-day Ukraine), where they were married by Abbot Ożarowski. The ten-hour journey to and from the ceremony took a toll on both husband and wife: <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> too swollen to walk, and he endured severe heart trouble.|$|E
25|$|Afterwards {{the imprint}} of <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>was</b> {{recorded}} in cement at the stadium, making her {{the first woman to}} be so honoured.|$|R

500|$|She {{spent six}} months in a {{wheelchair}} and another 18 months on crutches. Mortimer's right foot has six screws and a plate, and her left foot has two screws; her ankles are continuously sore, and occasionally lock up. During the Paralympics she told the Canadian Press that <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> [...] "killing" [...] her, and her condition is degenerative. When Mortimer's casts were removed her walking rehabilitation was in the water, and she thinks {{she would not be}} able to walk without the aquatic rehab. Before the injury, she had 10 sessions per week in the pool (swimming [...] each session) in addition to weight training and running. After the accident her weekly threshold at the local YMCA pool was [...] and four sessions in the weight room. Her disability is not usually evident to spectators, and according to the Canadian Press she walks with a [...] "halfway normal gait." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{originally}} {{scheduled to be}} directed by Brett Ratner, who had shot Carey's previous two videos. However, Jake Nava {{was used as the}} director instead, as Ratner had other obligations regarding one of his films. It was filmed during the end of June 2005. When describing the video's concept to MTV News, Carey said [...] "I actually just got the treatment. We came up with some cool concepts." [...] When asked for a more detailed synopsis, Carey declined and responded [...] "It's [...] "really technical. It's a new approach that I would have to let [...] explain. It's new territory." [...] During a scene in the video in which Carey had to wear very high-heeled pumps, she had the video crew carry her to various sections of the set. When Nava suggested she wear a pair of sensible flat footwear in between shoots, Carey jokingly replied [...] "my feet repel them dahling." [...] When recalling the moment in a later interview, Carey claimed <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> [...] "in agony" [...] and said [...] "My high heels had left my feet bleeding. Laugh all you want, my feet hurt." ...|$|E
2500|$|Often called [...] "Katia," [...] Gordeeva {{was born}} in Moscow, Soviet Union (now Russia) to Elena Lvovna Gordeeva, a {{teletype}} operator for TASS, and Alexander Alexeyevich Gordeev, a dancer for the Alexandrov Song and Dance Ensemble. Gordeeva said, [...] " [...] worked with me on movement very often when I was little." [...] Gordeeva has a younger sister, Maria Alexandrovna Gordeeva (born 1975), who lives in Moscow. Gordeeva began skating at age four, wearing multiple pairs of socks inside skates many sizes too big, because skates small enough for <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> unavailable in the Soviet Union.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the binding, many of the foot bones would remain broken, often for years. However, as the girl grew older, the bones would begin to heal. Even after the foot bones had healed, they were prone to re-breaking repeatedly, especially when the girl was in her teenage years and <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> still soft. Bones in the girls' feet would often be deliberately broken again in order to improve the size or the shape of the feet. This was especially the case with the toes, as small toes were especially desirable. Older women were more likely to break hips and other bones in falls, since they could not balance securely on their feet, and were less able to rise to their feet from a sitting position. [...] Other issues that might arise from foot binding included paralysis and muscular atrophy.|$|E
2500|$|Elisabeth {{seized on}} the excuse and left her husband and children, to spend the winter in seclusion. Six months later, a mere four days after her return to Vienna, she again {{experienced}} coughing fits and fever. She ate hardly anything and slept badly, and Dr. Skoda observed a recurrence of her lung disease. A fresh rest cure was advised, this time on Corfu, where she improved almost immediately. If her illnesses were psychosomatic, abating when she was removed from {{her husband and her}} duties, her eating habits were causing physical problems as well. In 1862 she had not seen Vienna for a year when her family physician, Dr. Fischer of Munich, examined her and observed serious anemia and signs of [...] "dropsy" [...] (edema). <b>Her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> sometimes so swollen that she could walk only laboriously, and with the support of others. On medical advice, she went to Bad Kissingen for a cure. Elisabeth recovered quickly at the spa, but instead of returning home to assuage the gossip about her absence she spent more time with her own family in Bavaria. In August 1862, after a two-year absence, she returned shortly before her husband's birthday, but immediately suffered from a violent [...] "migraine" [...] and vomited four times en route, which supports the theory that her primary complaints were stress-related and psychosomatic.|$|E
2500|$|Determining {{the cause}} of death was inconclusive, as the severe {{decomposition}} on the body had removed all signs of possible violence from the remains. However, the case is believed to have been a murder, as suicide was eliminated as a possibility of the girl's death. The circumstances of the location of the remains had also sparked suspicion among authorities. Toxicology tests were conducted to see if any drugs or alcohol had been in her system, yet the results were never released. Although the body was found in autumn, she had died in the summer, two to four months previously. This was established by examining traces from insects that were found on the remains. She had an overbite, and some fillings and dental sealants were found on the upper molars with no current cavities. The overbite was not described as extreme, but may have been noticeable, which could be a reliable feature depicted in her facial reconstruction. The estimated height was between 4'10" [...] and 5'4", the victim being between fifteen and twenty-one years old and weighing between 110 to 135 pounds, at an [...] "average frame". Examiners believe she was either white or Hispanic, although Native American and Asian races cannot be ruled out. She also may have been biracial. Other physical characteristics included a healed rib fracture and being pigeon toed or knock-kneed, which may have been noticeable when she walked, as <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> slanted inward. She also suffered from spina bifida occulta, but may have been unaware of the condition. To obtain DNA information, her femur was transported to the University of Texas.|$|E

2500|$|MacDonald {{suffered}} in her later years with heart trouble. She worsened in 1963 and underwent an arterial transplant at Methodist Hospital in Houston, Texas. [...] She had been signed {{to play the}} role of the Mother Abbess in the film version of The Sound of Music, but died before she could fulfill this commitment (the role went to Peggy Wood). [...] Nelson Eddy, in Australia on a nightclub tour, pleaded illness and returned to the States at word of MacDonald's surgery. [...] After the operation, she developed pleurisy and was hospitalized for two-and-a-half months. [...] Her friends kept the news from the press until just before her release. [...] Her large home was sold and she moved into a Los Angeles apartment that would not require so much of her energies. [...] Her husband moved into an adjoining apartment. Nelson Eddy took his own apartment in the opposite building. MacDonald was again stricken in 1964. Nelson Eddy was with her when she was admitted to UCLA Medical Center, where on Christmas Eve, she was operated on for abdominal adhesions. She was able to go home for New Year's, but in mid-January, husband Raymond flew her back to Houston. It was hoped that pioneer heart surgeon Dr. Michael DeBakey, who had recently operated successfully on the Duke of Windsor, could perform the same miracle for her. She checked in on January 12, and a program of intravenous feedings was begun to build her up for possible surgery. MacDonald died two days later on January 14 at 4:32 pm, with her husband at her bedside. According to press reports, MacDonald's last words to Raymond while he massaged <b>her</b> <b>feet</b> <b>were</b> [...] "I love you". [...] He replied [...] "I love you, too"; she smiled and succumbed.|$|E
