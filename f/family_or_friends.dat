5|$|In Cuba, {{slightly}} over 228,000 residents were evacuated from low-lying areas before the storm. Around 10% stayed in temporary shelters, {{while the rest}} stayed with <b>family</b> <b>or</b> <b>friends.</b> Included in the evacuation total were 6,000 tourists and over 1,000 residents in rickety houses. Workers protected tobacco leaves by moving them to sealed warehouses, and transported cattle and livestock to higher ground. The hurricane forced the closure of schools and the cancellation of some flights. The Cuban government issued a Hurricane Watch for Pinar del Río Province, Havana, Havana Province, and Isla de la Juventud 21hours before Irene hit. These areas, along with Matanzas Province, were upgraded to a Hurricane Warning 15hours before Irene hit the area.|$|E
5|$|During the {{genocide}} {{and in the}} months following the RPF victory, RPF soldiers killed many people they accused of participating in or supporting {{the genocide}}. Many of these soldiers were recent Tutsi recruits from within Rwanda who had lost <b>family</b> <b>or</b> <b>friends</b> and sought revenge. The scale, scope, and source of ultimate responsibility of these killings is disputed. Human Rights Watch, as well as scholars such as Prunier, allege that the death toll might be as high as 100,000, and that Kagame and the RPF elite either tolerated or organised the killings. In an interview with journalist Stephen Kinzer, Kagame acknowledged that killings had occurred but stated that they were carried out by rogue soldiers and had been impossible to control. The RPF killings gained international attention with the 1995 Kibeho massacre, in which soldiers opened fire on a camp for internally displaced persons in Butare Province. Australian soldiers serving as part of UNAMIR estimated at least 4,000 people were killed, while the Rwandan government claimed that the death toll was 338.|$|E

5|$|Gröning {{worked as}} a {{bookkeeper}} for a year until 1942, when the SS ordered that desk jobs would be reserved for injured veterans, and that fit members in administrative roles were {{to be subjected to}} more challenging duties. Gröning and about 22 of his colleagues travelled to Berlin where they reported to one of the SS economic offices. They were then given a lecture by several high-ranking officers who reminded them of the oath of loyalty they took, which they could prove by doing a difficult task. The task was top secret – Gröning and his comrades had to sign a declaration that they would not disclose it to <b>family</b> <b>or</b> <b>friends,</b> or people not in their unit. Once this had concluded, they were split into smaller groups and taken to various Berlin stations where they boarded a train in the direction of Katowice with orders to report to the commandant of Auschwitz, a place Gröning had not heard of before.|$|E
5|$|Heavy {{rains and}} storm surge caused {{significant}} damage {{on all three}} islands of the Comoros, with the worst occurring on Anjouan. There, 901houses were damaged, of which about 20% were destroyed. Flooding displaced 389people in Salamani where 33mud-built homes were destroyed. Landslides isolated the villages of Chiconi, Hamaba, Koni-Djodjo, Miringoni, and Nioumachioi, and damaged a road between Ngandzalé and Domoni. On the island, 7,879people had to evacuate their houses due {{to the risk of}} further landslides, some of whom went to schools set up as shelters while others stayed with <b>family</b> <b>or</b> <b>friends.</b> Storm surge on Mohéli flooded parts of Tsamia, Walla, and Zirindani, resulting in one fatality. Several houses were damaged on the island, and Djandro lost power due to a damaged power line. The Prince Said Ibrahim International Airport in Moroni on Grande Comore was closed for about 24hours due to the storm. Also on the island, a road was damaged, and one house was flooded. Shortly after the storm, workers began repairing roads and distributing aid.|$|E

Typically Gohl would ask if the sailors had any <b>family</b> <b>or</b> <b>friends</b> in the area. Then he would turn the conversation to the topic of money and valuables.

Initially, the three-storey home was rented from the council, although Fred would later purchase the property from the council for £7,000. To facilitate the Wests' purchasing the property from the council, many of the upper floor rooms would initially be converted into bedsits, to supplement the household income. To maintain a degree of privacy for his own family, Fred installed a cooker and a washbasin on the first-floor landing in order that their lodgers need not enter the ground floor where the West family lived, and only {{he and his family}} were permitted access to the garden of the property.

Ainsworth continued in Ebers's circle and attended many social events. He was encouraged by Ebers to sell his partnership in the Ainsworth law firm along with starting a publishing business. Ainsworth followed this advice, and the business had early success. In 1827, Fanny gave birth to a girl who took her name. Soon after, Ebers went bankrupt and Ainsworth lost a large sum as a consequence. Ainsworth published a few popular works, including The French Cook, an annual magazine called Mayfair, and some others. By 1829, Ebers took over Ainsworth's publishing business, and Fanny gave birth to another daughter, Emily, soon after. Ainsworth gave up on publishing and resumed working in law. When a third daughter, Anne, was born in 1830, Ainsworth's family began to feel financially strained. Ainsworth returned to writing and he contributed to Fraser's Magazine, but it is uncertain how many works were actually his. However, he was working on his novel Rookwood.|$|E
