A Gurken/TGF-alpha signal from the oocyte to the adjacent <b>follicle</b> <b>cells</b> assigns them a posterior identity [6, 7].

Early ectopic Ras activity induced transient expression of posterior <b>follicle</b> <b>cell</b> markers in anterior follicle cells, but did not inhibit anterior differentiation. Later ectopic Ras activity inhibited anterior <b>follicle</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation but did not induce posterior marker expression. Complete transformation of anterior follicle cells to posterior follicle cells required early ectopic Ras activity in egg chambers where terminal differentiation of anterior cells was inhibited.

40|$|The Drosophila melanogaster ovarian <b>follicle</b> <b>cell</b> lineage {{provides}} a powerful system for investigating how epigenetic changes contribute to differentiation. Downstream from an epithelial stem cell, follicle progenitors undergo nine mitotic cell cycles before transitioning to the endocycle and initiating differentiation.

Eventually, follicle progenitors acquire competence to respond to Delta, a Notch ligand present in the environment, which signals them to cease division and initiate differentiation. The time required to acquire competence determines the duration of mitotic cycling and hence the final number of follicle cells. We carried out a screen for dominant modifiers of variegation spanning nearly 70 % of Drosophila euchromatin to identify new genes influencing follicle progenitor epigenetic maturation. The eight genes found include chromatin modifiers, but also cell cycle regulators and transcription factors.

40|$|AbstractDrosophila egg {{development}} is an established model for studying epithelial patterning and morphogenesis, but {{the connection between}} signaling pathways and egg morphology is still incompletely understood. We have identified a non-classical cadherin, Cad 74 A, as a putative adhesion gene that bridges epithelial patterning and morphogenesis in the <b>follicle</b> <b>cells.</b> Starting in mid-oogenesis, Cad 74 A is expressed in the <b>follicle</b> <b>cells</b> that contact the oocyte, including the border cells {{and most of the}} columnar <b>follicle</b> <b>cells.</b> However, Cad 74 A is repressed in two dorsolateral patches of <b>follicle</b> <b>cells,</b> which participate in the formation of tubular respiratory appendages. We show genetically that Cad 74 A is downstream of the EGFR and BMP signaling pathways and is repressed by the Zn-finger transcription factor Broad. The correlation of Cad 74 A repression in the cells that bend out of the plane of the follicular epithelium is preserved across Drosophila species and mutant backgrounds exhibiting a range of eggshell phenotypes. Complete removal of Cad 74 A from the <b>follicle</b> <b>cells</b> causes defects in dorsal appendage formation. Ectopic expression of Cad 74 A in the roof cells results in shortened, flattened appendages due to the hindered migration of the roof cells. Based on these results, we propose that Cad 74 A is part of the adhesive machinery that enables robust dorsal appendage formation, and as such provides a link between the patterning of the <b>follicle</b> <b>cells</b> and eggshell morphogenesis...|$|R

This signal acts after the egg has left the <b>follicle</b> <b>cells</b> so this signal is stored in the perivitelline space.

These proteases are activated by the complex and cleave spätzle into an active form. This active protein is distributed in a ventral to dorsal gradient. Toll is a receptor tyrosine kinase for spätzle and transduces the graded spätzle signal through the cytoplasm to phosphorylate cactus. Once phosphorylated, cactus no longer binds to dorsal, leaving it free to enter the nucleus. The amount of released dorsal depends on the amount of spätzle protein present.|$|R
40|$|The {{elongation}} {{of tissues}} and organs during embryonic development results from the coordinate polarization of cell behaviors {{with respect to the}} elongation axis. Within the Drosophila melanogaster ovary, initially spherical egg chambers lengthen dramatically as they develop to create the elliptical shape of the mature egg. This morphogenesis depends on an unusual form of planar polarity within the egg chamber’s outer epithelial cell layer known as the follicle cells. Disruption of <b>follicle</b> <b>cell</b> planar polarity leads to the production of round rather than elongated eggs; however, the molecular mechanisms that control this tissue organization are poorly understood. Starting from a broadly based forward genetic screen, we have isolated 12 new round egg complementation groups, and have identified four of the mutated genes. In mapping the largest complementation group to the fat 2 locus, we unexpectedly discovered a high incidence of cryptic fat 2 mutations in the backgrounds of publicly available stocks. Three other complementation groups correspond to the genes encoding the cytoplasmic signaling proteins Tricornered (Trc), Furry (Fry), and Misshapen (Msn). Trc and Fry are known members of an NDR kinase signaling pathway, and as a Ste 20 -like kinase, Msn may function upstream of Trc. We show that all three proteins are required for <b>follicle</b> <b>cell</b> planar polarity at early stages of egg chamber elongation and that Trc shows a planar polarized distribution at the basal <b>follicle</b> <b>cell</b> surface.

40|$|Patterning of {{the body}} axes of the Drosophila embryo depends on maternally {{expressed}} genes, some of which function in the follicular epithelium of the developing egg chamber. Many such genes were identified in genetic screens for homozygous mutant females that produce abnormal embryos.

This limitation can be overcome by generating homozygous mutant <b>follicle</b> <b>cell</b> clones in heterozygous females using a system that induces site-specific mitotic recombination events. However, to date, eggs produced from egg chambers with complete <b>follicle</b> <b>cell</b> clones cannot be directly identified. We have developed an eggshell marker for <b>follicle</b> <b>cell</b> clones using a dominant negative (DN) allele of the gene defective chorion (dec). Females with a single copy of this allele, decDN, lay collapsed eggs and are therefore sterile. Site-specific mitotic recombination events induced in females heterozygous for decDN and a mutation on the homologous chromosome arm result in homozygous mutant follicle cells that have lost decDN. Therefore, egg chambers with the entire follicular epithelium homozygous mutant generate intact eggs that can be unambiguously identified amongst otherwise collapsed eggs...|$|E

Triton X- 100 extraction of <b>follicle</b> <b>cells</b> yielded a filamentous CF containing ~ 70 % of the total poly (A) but only 9 % of the total lipid, 23 % of the total protein, and 28 % of the total RNA.

40|$|Abstract Introduction Establishment of {{distinct}} <b>follicle</b> <b>cell</b> fates {{at the early}} stages of Drosophila oogenesis is crucial for achieving proper morphology of individual egg chambers. In Drosophila oogenesis, Notch-signaling controls proliferation and differentiation of follicular cells, which eventually results in the polarization of the anterior-posterior axis of the oocyte. Here we analyzed the functions of Tribolium Notch-signaling factors during telotrophic oogenesis, which differs fundamentally from the polytrophic ovary of Drosophila. Results We found Notch-signaling to be required for maintaining the mitotic cycle of somatic follicle cells. Upon Delta RNAi, follicle cells enter endocycle prematurely, which affects egg-chamber formation and patterning. Interestingly, our results indicate that Delta RNAi phenotypes are not solely due to the premature termination of cell proliferation. Therefore, we monitored the terminal/stalk cell precursor lineage by molecular markers. We observed that upon Delta RNAi terminal and stalk cell populations were absent, suggesting that Notch-signaling is also required for the specification of <b>follicle</b> <b>cell</b> populations, including terminal and stalk precursor cells. Conclusions We demonstrate that with respect to mitotic cycle/endocycle switch Notch-signaling in Tribolium and Drosophila has opposing effects. While in Drosophila a Delta-signal brings about the follicle cells to leave mitosis, Notch-signaling in Tribolium is necessary to retain telotrophic egg-chambers in an “immature” state. In most instances, Notch-signaling is involved in maintaining undifferentiated (or preventing specialized) cell fates. Hence, the role of Notch in Tribolium may reflectthe ancestral function of Notch-signaling in insect oogenesis. The functions of Notch-signaling in patterning the <b>follicle</b> <b>cell</b> epithelium suggest that Tribolium oogenesis may - analogous to Drosophila - involve the stepwise determination of different <b>follicle</b> <b>cell</b> populations. Moreover, our results imply that Notch-signaling may contribute at least to some aspects of oocyte polarization and AP axis also in telotrophic oogenesis. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe transmembrane {{receptor}} Notch is used repeatedly during {{development for}} a variety of essential functions. During Drosophila oogenesis, Notch activity is required first to specify particular <b>follicle</b> <b>cell</b> fates, then to promote the differentiation of all <b>follicle</b> <b>cell</b> types, to promote border cell migration, and then to form dorsal appendages, raising the question as to how Notch activity is spatially and temporally regulated. Here we show the Notch activity pattern during oogenesis. Notch activation was found in many follicle cells at stage 6 but then at stage 9 was restricted to migrating border cells, despite uniform expression of Delta. Expression of Kuzbanian (KUZ), a metalloproteinase that can activate Notch as well as cleave other substrates, is enriched in border cells at stage 9; and dominant-negative KUZ caused a strong border cell migration defect, without affecting expression of markers of border cell fate or <b>follicle</b> <b>cell</b> differentiation. Constitutively active Notch rescued the migration defect due to dominant-negative KUZ, and conditional alleles of Delta and Notch also exhibited border cell migration defects. Expression of two different reporters of Notch activity was lost upon expression of dominant-negative KUZ. Taken together these results show that Notch activation and KUZ expression are restricted to border cells at stage 9 of oogenesis and are required for migration, but not differentiation, of these cells. This represents a previously unrecognized mechanism for achieving spatial restriction of Notch signaling...|$|E

40|$|The {{secretion}} of the eggshell by the <b>follicle</b> <b>cells</b> in {{the desert}} locust, Schistocerca gregaria, was studied using the electron microscope. The 3 layers of the eggshell, the vitelline membrane, the endochorion, and the exochorion, are produced in sequence over {{a short period of}} about 30 — 36 h. The <b>follicle</b> <b>cells</b> contain little rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) and small in-conspicuous Golgi bodies during vitellogenesis. As eggshell secretion approaches there is an increase in the amount of RER and number of Golgi bodies. During vitelline membrane and endochorion secretion the RER and Golgi cisternae contain electron-dense product. At each stage of the 3 -phase secretion cycle the <b>follicle</b> <b>cells</b> contain Golgi bodies and secretion vesicles with distinct morphology. The <b>follicle</b> <b>cells</b> increase in breadth and decrease in height between {{the beginning and end of}} eggshell secretion. The endochorion ridges arise at the junction between <b>follicle</b> <b>cells</b> and appear to be moulded by the microvilli formed at this position. In the ovary prior to ovulation, the eggshell consists of a thin (0 - 5 /im) electron-dense vitelline membrane, a 5 —io-/*m-thick endochorion consisting of crystalline tubules in a granular matrix, and an outer fibrillar exochorion layer, 20 - 30 fim thick. Further changes take place in the vitelline membrane and the endochorion after oviposition, and a layer of curly fibres, the extra-chorion, is secreted in the oviduct...|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of an association of mRNA with the cytoskeletal framework (CF) of ascidian (Styela plicata) <b>follicle</b> <b>cells</b> was examined in this study. The approach was to extract the <b>follicle</b> <b>cells</b> with Triton X- 100 and determine whether mRNA persisted in the insoluble residue by two methods, in situ hybridization with poly(U) and actin DNA probes and the incorporation of radioactive isotopes into RNA. Triton X- 100 extraction of <b>follicle</b> <b>cells</b> yielded a filamentous CF containing approximately 70 % of the total poly (A) but only 9 % of the total lipid, 23 % of the total protein, and 28 % of the total RNA. In situ hybridization with a poly (U) probe indicated that approximately 70 % of the poly (A) {{was associated with the}} CF. In situ hybridization with a cloned actin DNA probe indicated that approximately 60 % of the actin mRNA was associated with the CF. Autoradiography of detergent- extracted <b>follicle</b> <b>cells,</b> which had been labeled with [3 H]uridine or [3 H]adenosine, indicated that greater than 90 % of the newly synthesized poly (A) +RNA was preserved in the CF. Thus more newly synthesized mRNA than steady-state mRNA may be present in the Triton X- 100 insoluble fraction. It is concluded that a significant proportion of the mRNA complement of ascidian <b>follicle</b> <b>cells</b> is associated with the CF...|$|R
40|$|The {{formation}} of the dorsoventral axis of the Drosophila embryo depends on cell–cell interactions {{that take place in}} the female ovary and involve the activation of transmembrane receptors by secreted ligands. The gene windbeutel functions in the somatic <b>follicle</b> <b>cells</b> of the ovary and is required for the generation of a signal that will determine the ventral side of the embryo. This signal originates in the <b>follicle</b> <b>cells</b> during oogenesis, but its actions are only manifested after fertilization, when the egg has already been laid. We have performed a molecular analysis of windbeutel. We have found that windbeutel encodes a putative resident protein of the endoplasmic reticulum, and has homologs in rats and humans. The gene is expressed for a brief period of time in the <b>follicle</b> <b>cells</b> of the ovary, at around the time when the dorsoventral axis of the egg chamber is first established. We propose that Windbeutel is responsible for the folding and/or modification of a specific factor that is secreted from the <b>follicle</b> <b>cells</b> and participates in the activation of the ventralizing signal...|$|R
