40|$|BSTRACT: The biosynthetic {{pathways}} of eicosapentaenoic ~¢id (20 : 5 n- 3) in microalgae, in general, and in Porphyridium ~ruentum, in particular, are not known. Some of {{the putative}} intermediates along the suggested pathways {{could not be}} de-~tected probably due to their low endogenous level. In order to Increase the endogenous levels of the intermediates, we pro-~ided various fatty acids in the growth medium. Exogenously ~upplied fatty acids were indeed incorporated into algal lipids ~nd were further metabolized along the n- 6 and n- 3 pathways. In the n- 6 pathway, 18 : 2 was <b>desaturated</b> <b>to</b> 18 : 3 n- 6, elongated ~t 0 20 : 3 n- 6, and subsequently <b>desaturated</b> <b>to</b> 20 : 4 n- 6 and then ~o 20 : 5 n- 3. In the n- 3 pathway, 18 : 2 was first <b>desaturated</b> <b>to</b> 18 : 3 n- 3 which was then sequentially converted, apparently by ~e same enzymatic sequence of the n- 6 pathway to 18 : 4 n- 3...|$|R

50|$|Delta-6-desaturation of {{palmitic}} acid {{leads to the}} biosynthesis of sapienic acid. In other tissues linoleic acid is the target for delta 6 desaturase, but linoleic acid is degraded in sebaceous cells, allowing the enzyme <b>to</b> <b>desaturate</b> palmitic <b>to</b> sapienic acid. A two-carbon extension product of sapienic acid, sebaleic acid, is also present in sebum.|$|R
50|$|PLP is an {{essential}} component of enzymes that facilitate the biosynthesis of sphingolipids. Particularly, the synthesis of ceramide requires PLP. In this reaction, serine is decarboxylated and combined with palmitoyl-CoA to form sphinganine, which is combined with a fatty acyl-CoA to form dihydroceramide. Dihydroceramide is then further <b>desaturated</b> <b>to</b> form ceramide. In addition, the breakdown of sphingolipids is also dependent on vitamin B6 because sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase, the enzyme responsible for breaking down sphingosine-1-phosphate, is also PLP-dependent.|$|R
50|$|De novo {{sphingolipid}} synthesis {{begins with}} formation of 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine by serine palmitoyltransferase. The preferred substrates for this reaction are palmitoyl-CoA and serine. However, {{studies have demonstrated}} that serine palmitoyltransferase has some activity toward other species of fatty acyl-CoA and alternative amino acids, and the diversity of sphingoid bases has recently been reviewed. Next, 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine is reduced to form dihydrosphingosine. Dihydrosphingosine is acylated by a (dihydro)-ceramide synthase, such as Lass1p or Lass2p (also termed as CerS), to form dihydroceramide. This is <b>desaturated</b> <b>to</b> form ceramide.|$|R
25|$|In humans, DHA {{is either}} {{obtained}} from the diet or may be converted in small amounts from eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5, ω-3) via docosapentaenoic acid (DPA, 22:5 ω-3) as an intermediate. This synthesis had been thought to occur through an elongation step followed {{by the action of}} Δ4-desaturase. It is now considered more likely that DHA is biosynthesized via a C24 intermediate followed by beta oxidation in peroxisomes. Thus, EPA is twice elongated, yielding 24:5 ω-3, then <b>desaturated</b> <b>to</b> 24:6 ω-3, then shortened to DHA (22:6 ω-3) via beta oxidation. This pathway is known as Sprecher's shunt.|$|R
40|$|In {{the course}} of the study of the {{biosynthesis}} of the fatty acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) in the microalga Porphyridium cruentum, cells were pulse-labeled with various radiolabeled fatty acid precursors. Our data show that the major end products of the biosynthesis are EPA-containing galactolipids of a eukaryotic and prokaryotic nature. The prokaryotic molecular species contain EPA and arachidonic acid at the sn- 1 position and C 16 fatty acids, mainly 16 : 0, at the sn- 2 positions, whereas in the eukaryotic species both positions are occupied by EPA or arachidonic acid. However, we suggest that both the eukaryotic and prokaryotic molecular species are formed in two pathways, [omega] 6 and [omega] 3, which involve cytoplasmic and chloroplastic lipids. In the [omega] 6 pathway, cytoplasmic 18 : 2 -phosphatidylcholine (PC) is converted to 20 : 4 [omega] 6 -PC by a sequence that includes a [delta] 6 desaturase, an elongation step, and a [delta] 5 desaturase. In the minor [omega] 3 pathway, 18 : 2 -PC is presumably <b>desaturated</b> <b>to</b> 18 : 3 [omega] 3, which is sequentially converted by the enzymatic sequence of the [omega] 6 pathway to 20 : 5 [omega] 3 -PC. The products of both pathways are exported, as their diacylglycerol moieties, to the chloroplast to be galactosylated into their respective monogalactosyldiacylglycerol molecular species. The 20 : 4 [omega] 6 in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic monogalactosyldiacylglycerol can be further <b>desaturated</b> <b>to</b> EPA by a chloroplastic [delta] 17 ([omega] 3) desaturase...|$|R
50|$|Dietary {{oxidized}} {{linoleic acid}} (LA, 18:2 ω-6) is inflammatory. In the body, LA is <b>desaturated</b> <b>to</b> form GLA (18:3 ω-6), yet dietary GLA is anti-inflammatory. Some observations partially explain this paradox: LA competes with &alpha;-linolenic acid, (ALA, 18:3 ω-3) for Δ6-desaturase, and thereby eventually inhibits formation of anti-inflammatory EPA (20:5 ω-3). In contrast, GLA does not compete for Δ6-desaturase. GLA's elongation product DGLA (20:3 ω-6) competes with 20:4 ω-3 for the Δ5-desaturase, {{and it might}} be expected that this would make GLA inflammatory, but it is not, perhaps because this step isn't rate-determining. Δ6-desaturase does appear to be the rate-limiting step; 20:4 ω-3 does not significantly accumulate in bodily lipids.|$|R

40|$|The {{antifungal}} {{natural product}} pyoluteorin contains a 4, 5 -dichloropyrrole moiety. The timing of dichlorination in the heteroaromatic ring is now shown to occur after proline is tethered by thioester linkage to the carrier protein PltL and enzymatically <b>desaturated</b> <b>to</b> the pyrrolyl-S-PltL. Surprisingly, the FADH 2 -dependent halogenase PltA catalyzes chlorination at both {{positions of the}} ring, generating the 5 -chloropyrrolyl-S-PltL intermediate and then the 4, 5 -dichloropyrrolyl-S-PltL product. PltA activity strictly depends on a heterologous flavin reductase that uses NAD(P) H to produce FADH 2. Electrospray ionization–Fourier transform MS detected five covalent intermediates attached to the 11 -kDa carrier protein PltL. Tandem MS localized the site of covalent modification on the carrier protein scaffold. HPLC analysis of the hydrolyzed products {{was consistent with the}} regiospecific chlorination at position 5 and then position 4 of the heteroaromatic ring.

50|$|Wilson et al. {{demonstrated}} the co-occurrence of malvalic acid {{and the corresponding}} cyclopropane acids in several types of seeds.

Smith and Bu'Lock showed that in Hibiscus seedlings the chains of sterculic and malvalic acids, but not the ring methylene carbon, were derived from acetate. They showed that the labeling pattern in malvalic acid {{was the same as}} that in sterculic acid minus the carboxyl carbon. They explained the shortening by α-oxidation occurring during the biogenesis of malvalic acid. Hooper and Law demonstrated that the ring methylene carbon of both cyclopropane and cyclopropene acids was derived from the methyl group of methionine in Hibiscus, and suggested from the distribution of label that the pathway was Oleic ⇒ dihydrosterculic ⇒ sterculic acid.|$|R
40|$|Long-chain {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} (LC-PUFAs) {{play an important}} role in several physiological processes and their concentration in phospholipids has been associated with several complex diseases, such as atopic disease. The level and composition of LC-PUFAs in the human body is highly dependent on their intake in the diet or on the intake of fatty acid precursors, which are endogenously elongated and <b>desaturated</b> <b>to</b> physiologically active LC-PUFAs. The most important enzymes in this reaction cascade are the Delta(5) and Delta(6) desaturase. Several studies in the last few years have revealed that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the 2 desaturase encoding genes (FADS 1 and FADS 2) are highly associated with the concentration of omega- 6 and omega- 3 fatty acids, showing that beside nutrition, genetic factors also {{play an important role}} in the regulation of LC-PUFAs.

40|$|Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, parent strain (ssf), was pulse-labelled with [14 C]acetate, [14 C]-palmitate or [14 C]oleate. Lipids were {{separated}} by TLC and HPLC. Radioactivity was measured in each class of lipids and in its fatty acids and molecular species. After 1 hour of incubation with acetate, the label was incorporated mainly into phosphatidylglycerol (PG), diacylglyceryl(N,N,N-trimethyl) homoserine (DGTS), digalactosyldiacylglycerol (DGDG) and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG). Saturated, monoene and diene fatty acids were strongly labelled. Within 10 hours of incubation {{in the absence of}} labelled precursor, the label shifted from monoenes and dienes to trienes and tetraenes. The transfer of radioactivity from mono- to polyunsaturated MGDG and DGDG molecular species suggests a lipid-linked desaturation of the C-l position (and, in MGDG, also of the C- 2 position) of these prokaryotic lipids. In the eukaryotic DGTS, all the species present were labelled simultaneously. On incubation with [14 C]-palmitate or [14 C]oleate, most of the label appeared in DGTS. Palmitate was immediately incorporated into the polyene species of DGTS, while oleate first appeared in the monoene species and then shifted to the polyene species.

We therefore studied the influence of sleep disordered breathing on neuropsychological function in 37 representative tetraplegic patients (mean age 34 ± 9. 7 years). Thirty percent (11 of 37 patients) had clinically significant sleep disordered breathing, defined as apnoea plus hypopnoea index (AHI) greater than 15 per hour of sleep. Most apnoeas were obstructive in type. Seven patients (19 %) <b>desaturated</b> <b>to</b> < 80 % during the night. Neuropsychological variables were significantly correlated with measures of sleep hypoxia, but not with the AHI and the frequency of sleep arousals. The neuropsychological functions most affected by nocturnal desaturation were: verbal attention and concentration, immediate and short-term memory, cognitive flexibility, internal scanning and working memory. There appeared to be a weak association between the presence of severe sleep hypoxia and visual perception, attention and concentration but no association was found between sleep variables and depression scores. We concluded that sleep disordered {{breathing is}} common in patients with tetraplegia and may be accompanied with significant oxygen desaturation.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Pulmonary {{hypertension}} (PH) adversely affects {{outcome in}} sarcoidosis {{and is an}} important predictor of mortality in these patients. Early and accurate diagnosis of this complication may improve outcome. The current authors hypothesised that integration of 6 -min walk test (6 MWT) {{as part of the}} evaluation leads to an earlier diagnosis of this complication. A total of 162 patients with sarcoidosis underwent 6 MWT. Demographic and pulmonary function results were analysed. Patients were further assessed by echocardiography and right heart catheterisation when clinically indicated. Patients with sarcoidosis-associated PH had significantly decreased results on pulmonary function testing. They also walked shorter distances and <b>desaturated</b> <b>to</b> lower levels on 6 MWT. On logistic regression analyses, significant predictors of PH were oxygen saturation, 90 % on 6 MWT (odds ratio (OR) 12. 1, 95 % confidence interval (CI) 3. 66 – 19. 73) and diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, 60 % predicted (OR 7. 3, 95 % CI 1. 98 – 24. 82). Moreover, by combining the results of oxygen saturation at 6 min with those of echocardiography, the ability to correctly predict the presence of PH by right heart catheterisation was improved. Patients with diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide, 60 % predicted and oxygen desaturation, 90 % on 6 -min walk test have a high likelihood of pulmonary hypertension and should undergo further evaluation for the presence of this disorder...|$|R
40|$|In deep {{geological}} disposal for high-level radioactive waste, the generated gas can potentially affect the sealing ability of bentonite buffers.

CarB displays sequence homology with members of the crotonase family including enoyl-CoA hydratase (crotonase) and methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase. The CarB reaction has been proposed to comprise condensation of acetyl coenzyme A (AcCoA) and glutamate semi-aldehyde to give (2 S, 5 S) -carboxymethylproline ((2 S, 5 S) -CMP). (2 S, 5 S) -CMP is then cyclized in an ATP-driven reaction catalyzed by CarA to give a carbapenam, which is subsequently epimerized and <b>desaturated</b> <b>to</b> give a carbapenem in a CarC-mediated reaction.

40|$|The {{systemic}} {{response to}} decreasing oxygen levels is hypoxic vasodilation. While this mechanism {{has been known}} for more than a century, the underlying cellular events have remained incompletely understood. Nitrite signaling is critically involved in vessel relaxation under hypoxia. This {{can be attributed to the}} presence of myoglobin in the vessel wall together with other potential nitrite reductases, which generate nitric oxide, one of the most potent vasodilatory signaling molecules. Questions remain relating to the precise concentration of nitrite and the exact dose-response relations between nitrite and myoglobin under hypoxia. It is furthermore unclear whether regulatory mechanisms exist which balance this interaction. Nitrite tissue levels were similar across all species investigated. We then investigated the exact fractional myoglobin desaturation in an ex vivo approach when gassing with 1 % oxygen. Within a short time frame myoglobin <b>desaturated</b> <b>to</b> 58 ± 12 %. Given that myoglobin significantly contributes to nitrite reduction under hypoxia, dose-response experiments using physiological to pharmacological nitrite concentrations were conducted. Along all concentrations, abrogation of myoglobin in mice impaired vasodilation. As reactive oxygen species may counteract the vasodilatory response, we used superoxide dismutase and its mimic tempol as well as catalase and ebselen to reduce the levels of reactive oxygen species during hypoxic vasodilation. Incubation of tempol in conjunction with catalase alone and catalase/ebselen increased the vasodilatory response to nitrite. Our study shows that modest hypoxia leads to a significant nitrite-dependent vessel relaxation. This requires the presence of vascular myoglobin for both physiological and pharmacological nitrite levels. Reactive oxygen species, in turn, modulate this vasodilation response...|$|R
40|$|Background: Hypoxemia {{is common}} during one-lung ventilation(OLV), {{predominantly}} due to transpulmonary shunt. None {{of the strategies}} tried showed consistent results. We evaluated the effectiveness of ventilating the operated, non-dependent lung (NDL) with small tidal volumes in improving the oxygenation during OLV. Methods: 30 ASA 1 and 2 patients undergoing elective, open thoracotomy were studied. After standard induction of anesthesia, lung seperation was acheived with left sided DLT. The ventilatory settings for two lung ventilation (TLV) were: FiO 2 of 0. 5, tidal volume of 8 - 10 ml/kg and respiratory rate of 10 - 12 /min. After initiating OLV, the dependent lung alone was ventilated with the above settings for 15 minutes and an arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis was done. Then the NDL was ventilated with a separate ventilator, with FiO 2 of 1, tidal volume of 70 ml, I:E ratio of 1 : 10 and respiratory rate of 6 /min for 15 minutes. The NDL ventilation was started early if the patients <b>desaturated</b> <b>to</b> < 95 %. ABG was done at 5 and 15 mins of NDL ventilation. We compared the PaO 2 values. Results: The mean PaO 2 decreased from 232. 2 ± 67. 2 mm of Hg (TLV-ABG 1) to 91. 2 ± 31. 7 mm of Hg on OLV (OLV-ABG 1). The ABG after 5 minutes and 15 minutes after institution of NDL ventilation during OLV showed a PaO 2 of 145. 7 ± 50. 2 mm of Hg and 170. 6 ± 50. 4 mm of Hg which were significantly higher compared to the one lung ventilation values...|$|R
40|$|Triacylglycerol (TAG), {{typically}} represents < 1 % of leaf glycerolipids but can accumulate {{under stress}} and other condi-tions or if leaves are supplied with fatty acids, or in plants transformed with regulators or enzymes of lipid metabo-lism. To {{better understand the}} metabolism of TAG in leaves, pulse–chase radiolabelling experiments were designed to probe its synthesis and turnover. When Arabidopsis leaves were incubated with [14 C]lauric acid (12 : 0), a major initial product was [14 C]TAG. Thus, despite low steady-state levels, leaves possess substantial TAG biosynthetic capacity. The contributions of diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 and phospholipid:diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 to leaf TAG syn-thesis were examined by labelling of dgat 1 and pdat 1 mutants. The dgat 1 mutant displayed a major (76 %) reduction in [14 C]TAG accumulation whereas pdat 1 TAG labelling was only slightly reduced. Thus, DGAT 1 has a principal role in TAG biosynthesis in young leaves. During a 4 h chase period, radioactivity in TAG declined 70 %, whereas the turnover of [14 C]acyl chains of phosphatidylcholine (PC) and other polar lipids was much lower. Sixty percent of [14 C] 12 : 0 was directly incorporated into glycerolipids without modification, whereas 40 % was elongated and <b>desaturated</b> <b>to</b> 16 : 0 and 18 : 1 by plastids. The unmodified [14 C] 12 : 0 and the plastid products of [14 C] 12 : 0 metabolism entered different pathways. Although plastid-modified 14 C-labelled products accumulated in monogalactosyldiacylglycerol, PC, phosphatidyletha-nolamine, and diacylglcerol (DAG), {{there was almost no}} accumulation of [14 C] 16 : 0 and [14 C] 18 : 1 in TAG.

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate the effect of different dietary lipid sources, age and sex on the SFA and MUFA metabolism in broiler chickens using a whole body fatty acid balance method. Four dietary lipid sources (palm fat, Palm; soyabean oil, Soya; linseed oil, Lin; and fish oil, Fish) were added at 3 % to a basal diet containing 5 % Palm. Diets were fed to female and male chickens from day 1 to either day 21 or day 42 of age. The accumulation (percentage of net intake and ex novo production) of SFA and MUFA was significantly lower in broilers fed on Palm than in broilers fed on the other diets (85 · 7 v. 97 · 4 %). Conversely, β-oxidation was significantly higher in Palm-fed birds than the average of the other dietary treatments (14 · 3 v. 2 · 6 %). On average, 33 · 1 % of total SFA and MUFA accumulated in the body were elongated, and 13 · 8 % were Δ- 9 <b>desaturated</b> <b>to</b> longer chain or more unsaturated metabolites, with lower proportions being elongated and desaturated for the Palm and Fish diets than for the Soya and Lin diets. Total in vivo apparent elongase activity decreased exponentially in relation to the net intake of SFA and MUFA, while it increased with age. Total in vivo apparent Δ- 9 desaturase activity was not significantly affected by dietary treatment or age. Total ex novo production and β-oxidation of SFA and MUFA showed a negative and positive curvilinear relationship with net intake of SFA and MUFA, respectively. Sex had no effect on SFA and MUFA metabolism. <br /...|$|R
