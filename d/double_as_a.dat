5|$|On 19 April 2009, Diarra {{scored the}} only goal in Bordeaux's 1–0 win over title rivals Lyon at the Stade de Gerland. The victory helped the club create {{a gap between}} itself and Lyon. Bordeaux, subsequently, went on a six-match winning streak to close out the season, which {{resulted}} in the club capturing the sixth title in its history and its first since 1999. Bordeaux also recorded its second ever <b>double,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of its league cup title. Diarra finished the season with a career-high 45 total appearances and three goals.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} over a 13 to 14 days period in December 2001. It was not filmed on order of the script; the scenes set around the Osbourne {{residence}} for instance, were all filmed at once, during two to three days, though during the episodes, the scenes took place in separate parts of the episode. Parts of the introduction scenes, where Danny's team break into Osbourne's house, was actually filmed on the Grid set. Parts of the sequence were originally filmed without sound; the sound would later be added during post production. The footage of the drowned immigrants found at the shore were shot by the second unit headed by producer Simon Crawford Collins on a pebbled courtyard in Kensington to <b>double</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> beach.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to CAP's own corporate fleet, many member-owned aircraft are {{made available for}} official tasking by CAP's volunteers should the need arise. Aircraft on search missions are generally crewed by at least three qualified aircrew members: a Mission Pilot, responsible for the safe flying of the aircraft; a Mission Observer, responsible for navigation, communications and coordination of the mission as well as ground observation; and a Mission Scanner {{who is responsible for}} looking for crash sites and damage clues. Additionally, the mission scanner may <b>double</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> satellite digital imaging system (SDIS) operator. Larger aircraft may have additional scanners aboard, providing greater visual coverage. Because of the additional ARCHER equipment, the crew of a Civil Air Patrol GA8 Airvan may also include an operator of the ARCHER system, depending upon the requirements of the mission and the capabilities of the aircraft.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} two weeks, Gourcuff scored his {{fifth and sixth}} goals, respectively, against Nantes in a 2–1 victory and Lille in a 2–2 draw. After going goalless in the league for seven straight weeks, Gourcuff got back on track scoring against relegation-bound Le Havre. On 20 April 2009, Gourcuff scored his first career double against his former club Rennes in a 3–2 victory. In the ensuing three weeks, Gourcuff maintained his form scoring in all three matches, against Sochaux, Valenciennes, and Le Mans giving him a tally of 12 league goals for the season. Bordeaux won all three matches, which effectively put them in first-place position heading into the final week of the season. Bordeaux eventually won the league capturing the sixth title in the club's history. The club also recorded its second ever <b>double,</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> result of its Coupe de la Ligue title. For his efforts during the 2008–09 season, Gourcuff was awarded the UNFP Ligue 1 Player of the Year award. He was also named in the organization's Ligue 1 Team of the Year. His performances during the 2008–09 season later earned him a nomination by the French magazine France Football for the 2009 Ballon d'Or award, won by Lionel Messi as Gourcuff finished in 20th place with six points.|$|E

These now are stored in the cathedral's pinacotheca and not available to the public. Restoration work uncovered al fresco murals on the lateral walls, relating to the martyrdom of Philip of Jesus, the first Mexican canonized as a saint.
