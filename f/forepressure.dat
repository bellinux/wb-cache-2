This paper proposes <b>forepressure</b> transmission control for efficient and fair video transmission in this scenario. Contrary to traditional backpressure transmission control where downstream node creates backpressure and causes upstream node to hold off when its buffer is full, <b>forepressure</b> transmission control creates <b>forepressure</b> and signals upstream node to transmit when the downstream node’s buffer is not full. <b>Forepressure</b> transmission control proactively avoids congestion at little communication overhead. In addition, it is able to provide fairness among concurrent flows. We evaluate <b>forepressure</b> transmission control via NS- 2 simulations, and compare it with both backpressure congestion control and end-to-end rate regulation. Results in three typical topologies show that <b>forepressure</b> transmission control achieves much lower loss ratio and ensures better fairness than the other two schemes.
