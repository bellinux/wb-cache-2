25|$|Expiry (or Expiration in the U.S.) is {{the time}} and the day that a {{particular}} <b>delivery</b> <b>month</b> of a futures contract stops trading, as well as the final settlement price for that contract. For many equity index and Interest rate future contracts (as well as for most equity options), this happens on the third Friday of certain trading months. On this day the t+1 futures contract becomes the t futures contract. For example, for most CME and CBOT contracts, at the expiration of the December contract, the March futures become the nearest contract. This is an exciting time for arbitrage desks, which try to make quick profits during the short period (perhaps 30 minutes) during which the underlying cash price and the futures price sometimes struggle to converge. At this moment the futures and the underlying assets are extremely liquid and any disparity between an index and an underlying asset is quickly traded by arbitrageurs. At this moment also, the increase in volume is caused by traders rolling over positions to the next contract or, in the case of equity index futures, purchasing underlying components of those indexes to hedge against current index positions. On the expiry date, a European equity arbitrage trading desk in London or Frankfurt will see positions expire in as many as eight major markets almost every half an hour.|$|E
2500|$|Exchange-traded {{contracts}} are standardized by the exchanges where they trade. The contract details what asset {{is to be}} bought or sold, and how, when, where and in what quantity {{it is to be}} delivered. The terms also specify the currency in which the contract will trade, minimum tick value, and the last trading day and expiry or <b>delivery</b> <b>month.</b> Standardized commodity futures contracts may also contain provisions for adjusting the contracted price based on deviations from the [...] "standard" [...] commodity, for example, a contract might specify delivery of heavier USDA Number 1 oats at par value but permit delivery of Number 2 oats for a certain seller's penalty per bushel.|$|E
5000|$|For futures {{contracts}} specifying physical delivery, the <b>delivery</b> <b>month</b> is {{the month}} {{in which the}} seller must deliver, and the buyer must accept and pay for, the underlying.

If gold for August delivery is bid $1601.20 asking $1601.30, and gold for October delivery is bid $1603.20 asking $1603.30, then the calendar spread would be bid -$2.10 asking -$1.90 for August-October.|$|R

As a coarse approximation, 1000 ft3 of natural gas ≈ 1 MMBtu ≈ 1 GJ. Monthly contracts expire 3-5 days {{in advance of the}} first day of the <b>delivery</b> <b>month,</b> at which points traders may either settle their positions financially with other traders in the market (if they have not done so already) or choose to [...] "go physical" [...] and accept delivery of physical natural gas (which is actually quite rare in the financial market).|$|E

50|$|In {{the futures}} markets, {{there is no}} {{assurance}} that a liquid market may exist for offsetting a commodity contract at all times.

2500|$|For [...] "vanilla" [...] or [...] "generic" [...] 30-year pools (FN/FG/GN) with coupons of 3.5%–7%, {{one can see}} {{the prices}} posted on a TradeWeb screen by the {{primaries}} called To Be Allocated (TBA). This is due to the actual pools not being shown. These are forward prices for the next 3 <b>delivery</b> <b>months</b> since pools have not been cut; only the issuing agency, coupon, and dollar amount are revealed. A specific pool whose characteristics are known would usually trade [...] "TBA plus {x} ticks" [...] or a [...] "pay-up", depending on characteristics. These are called [...] "specified pools", since the buyer specifies the pool characteristic he/she is willing to [...] "pay up" [...] for.|$|R
50|$|To name a {{specific}} contract {{in a financial}} futures market, the month code will follow the contract code, and in turn be followed by the year. For example, CLZ3 is the December 2013 NYMEX crude oil contract. CL denotes crude oil (crude light), Z corresponds to the December <b>delivery</b> <b>month,</b> and 3 refers to 2013.|$|E
50|$|Basis can {{be defined}} as the {{difference}} between the spot price of a given cash market asset and the price of its related futures contract. There will be a different basis for each <b>delivery</b> <b>month</b> for each contract. Usually, basis is defined as cash price minus futures price, however, the alternative definition, future price minus cash, is also used. A basis trade profits from the closing of an unwarranted gap between the futures contract and the associated cash market instrument.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to analyze the risk protection provided by the futures contracts traded at CBOT (Chicago Board of Trade) at different <b>delivery</b> <b>months</b> to Brazilian Soybean hedgers. The empirical approach adopted was the estimation of hedging effectiveness between every Brazilian production state and the CBOT futures contracts. The results showed that the contracts for delivery in the second semester are more effective, mainly those for delivery in July and August. Moreover, supply shocks in the U. S. can make even the contracts for delivery in November and January to be very effective because of stronger procurement for Brazilian soybeans. The results also show that hedging effectiveness is larger near export harbors, as they were the cases of CÃ¢ndido Mota (SP), Campo Mourão (PR) and Ponta Grossa (PR).

40|$|The Chicago Board of Trade Treasury Bond Futures Contract {{allows the}} short {{position}} several delivery options {{as to when}} and with which bond the contract will be settled. The timing option allows the short position to choose any business day in the <b>delivery</b> <b>month</b> to make delivery. In addition, the contract settlement price is locked in at 2 : 00 p. m. when the futures market closes, despite the facts that the short position need not declare an intent to settle the contract until 8 : 00 p. m. and that trading in Treasury bonds car, occur all day in dealer markets. If bond prices change significantly between 2 : 00 and 8 : 00 p. m., the short has the option of settling the contract at a favorable 2 : 00 p. m. price. This phenomenon, which recurs on every trading day of the <b>delivery</b> <b>month,</b> creates a sequence of 6 -hour put options for the short position which has been dubbed the "wild card option.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I analyze Canadian {{government}} regulation of rail transportation as {{it affects the}} domestic price of canola in both the street and futures market.

I offer {{an explanation of the}} futures premium. In addition, I find that there is evidence to support a contention that a change in rail car policy in 1989 improved canola throughput efficiency in Vancouver and may have led to higher street prices.

40|$|Cash and futures prices {{should reach}} equality, or converge, upon {{contract}} maturity. Traders can impose convergence during the <b>delivery</b> <b>month</b> through arbitrage behavior: either making or taking delivery on futures contracts. If convergence is not predictable, a futures market fails {{to provide a}} clear storage signal to potential inventory holders and reduces the attractiveness of hedging. Recent convergence problems in domestic commodity markets demonstrate the existence of persistent, significant arbitrage opportunities over {{the second half of}} the last decade. Yet, terminal elevator operators—perhaps the only participants with the capacity to do so—have not arbitraged away these riskless returns by making enough deliveries. This model demonstrates conditions under which a profit maximizing warehouseman foregoes available arbitrage. We find that making delivery involves substantial opportunity costs, which stem from the loss of managerial control over warehouse space. We refer to the inconvenience of losing such control as the inconvenience cost.

Price discovery generally originates in the futures market with about 65 % {{of new information}} being passed from the futures to the cash market.

The very short-term basis for hogs is fairly stable, with approximately 85 % of yesterday's nearby-basis persisting today. Generally, little can be gained by speculating on basis from day to day.
