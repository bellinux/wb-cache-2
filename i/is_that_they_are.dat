5|$|An {{important}} aspect {{of all of these}} examples of noise in European keyboard and string music before the 19th century <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> used as sound effects in programme music. Sounds that would likely cause offense in other musical contexts are made acceptable by their illustrative function. Over time, their evocative effect was weakened as {{at the same time they}} became incorporated more generally into abstract musical contexts.|$|E
5|$|Everton's current {{position}} regarding {{the future of}} Goodison Park <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> considering all options, including relocation, redevelopment of the current ground, or a groundshare with Liverpool F.C., in a new, purpose-built stadium in Stanley Park, stressing that finance is the main factor affecting decision-making.|$|E
5|$|Induced {{defenses}} include secondary metabolic products, {{as well as}} morphological {{and physiological}} changes. An advantage of inducible, as opposed to constitutive defenses, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> only produced when needed, and are therefore potentially less costly, especially when herbivory is variable.|$|E

5|$|Interesting, perhaps, {{in the use}} {{of weapons}} in these recent “revolutionary” works <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are,</b> {{generally}} speaking, not reenactments of traditional folk dances. The introduction of weaponry into Chinese ballet—regardless of the revolutionary message—was, itself, a revolution.|$|E
5|$|The {{instructions}} in Compendium ferculorum are succinct and often vague, lacking such elements of modern culinary recipes as lists of ingredients used, measurements or proportions, and cooking times. The underlying assumption <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{to be used}} by a professional chef rather than a person with little cooking experience. The recipe for stewed meat in saffron sauce, cited below, is typical is this regard.|$|E
5|$|Angela Martin (Angela Kinsey), {{having found}} a {{loophole}} in her parenting contract with Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) which permits him to develop romantic feelings for her, attempts to attract him. She uses another technicality {{in the contract}} {{to force him to}} take her to Andy's play as a date, and wears uncharacteristically revealing clothing. But when Dwight becomes lustful, Angela rebuffs him and insists that they count the date as one of their five required instances of sexual intercourse. Meanwhile, Andy and Erin chat backstage, and Erin states how happy she <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> spending time together outside of the Office. However, Erin's boyfriend calls and she leaves to meet him. As Andy sulks backstage, his co-workers arrive and cheer him up.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, astronomers {{discovered}} {{a completely new}} type of star cluster in the Andromeda Galaxy, which is, in several ways, very similar to globular clusters. The new-found clusters contain {{hundreds of thousands of}} stars, a similar number to that found in globular clusters. The clusters share other characteristics with globular clusters such as stellar populations and metallicity. What distinguishes them from the globular clusters <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> much larger – several hundred light-years across – and hundreds of times less dense. The distances between the stars are, therefore, much greater within the newly discovered extended clusters. Parametrically, these clusters lie somewhere between a globular cluster and a dwarf spheroidal galaxy.|$|E

5|$|The idea {{of group}} living has been {{discussed}} by many evolutionists for its costs and benefits. Alexander predicted that the cost to large groups <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely to suffer}} from parasitism, but at the same time, they benefit by defense against predation. This theory is not supported in the case of P.exclamans because the parasitism does not always increase with nest size and the predation rate was independent of size.|$|E

5|$|The {{source of}} the long {{secondary}} periods is unknown, but they certainly aren't due to radial pulsations. Interferometric observations of Betelgeuse have shown hotspots that {{are thought to be}} created by massive convection cells, a significant fraction of the diameter of the star and each emitting 5–10% of the total light of the star. One theory to explain long secondary periods <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> caused by the evolution of such cells combined with the rotation of the star. Other theories include close binary interactions, chromospheric magnetic activity influencing mass loss, or non-radial pulsations such as g-modes.|$|E
5|$|Asch also {{believed}} {{the relationship between}} conformity and non-conformity was {{not as simple as}} one being the opposite of the other. This was Asch's third influential idea, and he suggested that conformity and resistance might be explained by their own unique social psychological processes. Conformity, for instance, could be a function of how aware a person <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> being influenced by the group (distortion of perception), {{the degree to which the}} person believes that the group consensus is correct (distortion of judgement), and how badly the person wants to be accepted by the group (distortion of action). Although these exact terms have not been directly ported over to the literature, researchers such as Moscovici and Nemeth have adopted the perspective that majority and minority influence are moderated by multiple processes (Levine, 1999).|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} problem that faces reports of transient lunar phenomena {{is that the}} vast majority of these were made either by a single observer or at a single location on Earth (or both). The multitude of reports for transient phenomena occurring at the same place on the Moon could be used as evidence supporting their existence. However, in the absence of eyewitness reports from multiple observers at multiple locations on Earth for the same event, these must be regarded with caution. As discussed above, an equally plausible hypothesis for some of these events <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> caused by the terrestrial atmosphere. If an event were to be observed at two different places on Earth at the same time, this could be used as evidence against an atmospheric origin.|$|E
2500|$|There are two {{persistent}} {{myths that}} {{show up in}} almost every book or article which mentions {{the role of the}} White Pass & Yukon Route in the building of the Alcan Highway during the Second World War. The myths concern the eleven new USATC S118 Class locomotives that the United States Army Transportation Corps brought to the WP in 1943. Myth No.1 <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> converted from [...] gauge to [...] gauge by the WP shops in Skagway, Alaska.

25|$|Dead weights are the {{simplest}} type of anchor. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> generally {{made as a}} large concrete block with a rode attached which resists movement with sheer weight; and, to a small degree, by settling into the substrate. In New Zealand old railway wheels are sometimes used. The advantages <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> simple and cheap. A dead weight mooring that drags in a storm still holds well in its new position. Such moorings are better suited to rocky bottoms where other mooring systems do not hold well. The disadvantages <b>are</b> <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> heavy, bulky, and awkward.|$|R
