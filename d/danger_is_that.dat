5|$|The volcano {{continues}} {{to pose a}} serious threat to nearby towns and villages. Of the threats, the one with the most potential for <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of small-volume eruptions, which can destabilize glaciers and trigger lahars. Although much of the volcano's glacier mass has retreated, a significant volume of ice still sits atop Nevado del Ruiz and other volcanoes in the Ruiz–Tolima massif. Melting just 10 percent of the ice would produce lahars with a volume of up to 200million cubic meterssimilar to the lahar that destroyed Armero in 1985. In just hours, these lahars can travel up to 100km along river valleys.|$|E
25|$|Cole also censures the George W. Bush {{administration}} for not pushing for democratization in Pakistan. Such a development would not threaten U.S. interests, he writes, since whenever elections have been held, Taliban-like movements {{have not received}} much support from voters. On the contrary, the <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> U.S. support for Musharraf may alienate middle-class Pakistanis. Cole {{is also on the}} Editorial Board of Pakistaniaat.|$|E
500|$|Fred von Lohmann, an {{attorney}} with the Electronic Frontier Foundation, raised free speech concerns in the Xenu.net case, stating: [...] "The <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people will attempt to silence critics under the guise of copyright infringement." [...] In Beyond the First Amendment: The Politics of Free Speech and Pluralism, author Samuel Peter Nelson raises the question: [...] "Why should a private actor (Church of Scientology) in the United States have the power to restrict the speech of a Dutch citizen publishing in the Netherlands whose speech is protected by Dutch law?" [...] In an interview on the Xenu.net controversy, Harvard Law School professor Jonathan Zittrain predicted that more conflicts involving the Church of Scientology were likely to occur in the future. Zittrain stated: [...] "The cutting edge on such battles is often the Church of Scientology. They have very well honed procedures and tactics to remove information that they find objectionable." ...|$|E
60|$|Really, the {{one great}} <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{one of the}} men might stumble and fall, and then the yellow devil would be upon him in a moment and the joy of the kill would be too great a temptation to withstand.|$|R
25|$|Another <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the {{friction}} igniter was very sensitive, a powerful {{blow to the}} grenade with the detonator inserted could set it off. This made the No 6 almost as dangerous as the percussion cap grenades <b>that</b> it <b>was</b> designed to replace.|$|R
5000|$|Particular sounds, like bells, may be {{used for}} purifying the place in which the ritual is to be performed. This is because a ritual {{involving}} contact with the spirits is always potentially dangerous, and one of the <b>dangers</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> of pollution.|$|R
2500|$|In April 2013, Womack {{said of her}} departure, [...] "I {{think it}} was {{definitely}} {{the right time to}} give the character a break. The <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if you get one character who is subject to so much trauma, angst and depression, it becomes difficult to play it realistically." ...|$|E
2500|$|A similar {{process is}} thought to {{potentially}} happen to any particulate material, which contains [...] "organic" [...] (carbon-containing) matter, especially in cylinders which are used for hyperoxic gas mixtures. If the compressor air filter(s) fail, ordinary dust will be introduced to the cylinder, which contains organic matter (since it usually contains humus). A more severe <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> air particulates on boats and industrial areas, where cylinders are filled, often contain carbon-particulate combustion products (these are what makes a dirt rag black), and these represent a more severe CO danger when introduced into a cylinder.|$|E
2500|$|He {{blamed the}} omnipotence of {{majority}} rule as a chief factor in stifling thinking: [...] "The majority has enclosed thought within a formidable fence. A writer is free inside that area, but woe {{to the man}} who goes beyond it, not that he stands in fear of an inquisition, but he must face all kinds of unpleasantness in every day persecution. A career in politics is closed to him for he has offended the only power that holds the keys." [...] Tocqueville, in contrast to previous political thinkers, argued that a serious problem in political life was not that people were too strong, but that people were [...] "too weak" [...] and felt powerless; the <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> people felt [...] "swept up in something that they could not control", according to Kaplan's interpretation of Tocqueville.|$|E
50|$|At dawn on 2 January 2010, Nyamuragira began spewing out lava flows. There are no {{settlements}} {{close to}} the volcano, but wildlife officials feared that the eruption may threaten the chimpanzees in the area. Another <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the lava could have flowed into the southern sector of Virunga National Park, where there are settlements and villages.|$|R
60|$|The rapid {{was a short}} though rough one. The chief <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{the line}} might be cut among the foam-covered rocks, or that the hook, if not firmly fixed, might tear itself away; also that the fisher might fall, which would {{probably}} be fatal to rod or line, {{to say nothing of}} elbows and shins.|$|R

2500|$|The tanker {{aircraft}} flies straight and level and extends the hose/drogue which {{is allowed to}} trail out behind and below the tanker under normal aerodynamic forces. The pilot of the receiver aircraft extends his probe (if required) and uses normal flight controls to [...] "fly" [...] the refueling probe directly into the basket. [...] This requires a closure rate of approximately two knots (walking speed) {{in order to establish}} solid probe/drogue coupling and push the hose several feet into the HDU. [...] Too little closure will cause an incomplete connection and no fuel flow (or occasionally leaking fuel). Too much closure is dangerous because it can trigger a strong transverse oscillation in the hose, severing the probe tip. Another significant <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the drogue may hit the recipient aircraft and damage it—instances have occurred in which the drogue has shattered the canopy of a fighter aircraft, causing great danger to its pilot.|$|E
2500|$|The 50/60Hz {{currents}} {{in the primary}} circuit of a Tesla coil are lethally dangerous, and require standard safety precautions used with other kilovolt electrical devices. [...] However, the high voltage radio frequency (RF) discharges from the output terminal pose a unique hazard not found in other high voltage equipment: when passed through the body they often do not cause the painful sensation and muscle contraction of electric shock, as lower frequency AC or DC currents do. [...] The nervous system is insensitive to currents with frequencies over 10 – 20kHz. [...] It is thought {{that the reason for}} this is that a certain minimum number of ions must be driven across a nerve cell's membrane by the imposed voltage to trigger the nerve cell to transmit an impulse. [...] At radio frequencies, there is insufficient time during a half-cycle for enough ions to cross the membrane before the alternating voltage reverses. [...] The <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> since no pain is felt, experimenters often assume the currents are harmless. [...] Teachers and hobbyists demonstrating small Tesla coils often impress their audience by touching the high voltage terminal or allowing the streamer arcs to pass through their body.|$|E
2500|$|Michael Billington {{reviewing}} in The Times {{was much}} more favourable to the ITV coverage. He said they had [...] "seized the initiative" [...] off the BBC. [...] "In the past {{it has always been}} the BBC that has been ready to abandon its schedules to suit historic public events: yesterday, however, the traditional roles were reversed and it was the BBC that persevered with Dr. Finlay's Casebook and The Black and White Minstrel Show while independent television showed itself far more flexible and enterprising." [...] He praised Frost for the way he [...] "chaired the proceedings with his usual unflappable professionalism" [...] and Burnett for [...] "combining straight news with personal comment", though he said [...] "the combination of news and variety is more debatable. There is certainly something a bit strange about going straight from a discussion about the orbit of Luna 15 to hearing Cilla Black singing her latest recording. On balance, I think this type of juxtaposition is justified, if only because some point of rest is needed in a programme of this length. The <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the viewer will be so saturated with information that his responses will be blunted {{when it comes to the}} moments of real excitement: pop music, however, provides the necessary let-up and fulfills much the same function as comic relief in a five-act drama.|$|E
60|$|He saw her on to a bus at Kingston, {{and himself}} went back by train. They agreed {{they would not}} mention it to Mrs. Phillips. Not {{that she would have}} minded. The <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> she would want to come, too; {{honestly}} thinking thereby to complete their happiness. It seemed to be tacitly understood there would be other such excursions.|$|R
60|$|When {{left alone}} Harry {{blew out the}} other candles, but left that in the lantern burning, and threw himself down on the locker and thought over {{every detail of the}} work for the next day. As he had said, the great <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> of Virginie {{struggling}} and being too frightened to follow his instructions. Certainly he could fasten a rope round her, but even then it might be difficult to manage her. The next <b>danger</b> <b>was,</b> <b>that</b> other persons might cling to the hatchway. Harry felt the long knife which was concealed in his breast.|$|R
50|$|After World War II {{and under}} Communist rule, the manufactory {{that had always}} catered to the rich and wealthy had some {{difficulty}} to find its way. The <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Meissen would become a factory merely producing for the masses. It was not until 1969, when Karl Petermann became the director, that Meissen went back to focus on its old traditions and was also allowed a freer artistic expression.|$|R
2500|$|... "New Delhi {{has very}} limited {{bandwidth}} for officials from Brussels, {{all of whom}} have important sounding titles but with often dissimilar perspectives on overlapping mandates"; asserted the former Canadian diplomat and Rector of the United Nations University (UNU) David Malone, bluntly assessing the qualitative effectiveness of elaborately crafted EU-India Joint Action Plans as : [...] "these measures lead mainly to dialogue, commitments to further dialogue, and exploratory committees and working groups, rather than to significant policy measures or economic breakthroughs.". Former French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine echoed the sentiment saying [...] "EU spends too much time issuing well meaning statements rather than dealing with the hard realities of a rough world". The former British High Commissioner to New Delhi, Sir Michael Arthur, warned that the relation with the European Union was already in a state of regress because India very much sees {{the world in terms of}} Nation states; a view shared by Shashi Tharoor, presently the Chairman of India's Parliamentary Standing Committee on External Affairs, who opined that the Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) of the Institutions of the European Union has little added-value to offer India over and above what it can already obtain through bilateral relations with strategic partners in Europe (France and UK continue to be influential geopolitical players as UNSC P5 members and who when joined by Germany form the EU-3 troika which accounts for the bulk of EU-India trade). [...] "The <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> New Delhi will write Europe off as a charming but irrelevant continent, ideal for a summer holiday but not for serious business." [...] said Tharoor and observed that India-EU relations lack substance and strategic weight on matters of core interest to India.|$|E

60|$|To {{escape the}} great wave was {{no part of}} the captain's plan. To have reached the shore before the wave would have been fatal to all. Their only hope lay in the {{possibility}} of riding in on the top of it, and the great <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> they should <b>be</b> unable to rise to it stern first when it came up, or that they should turn broadside on and be rolled over.|$|R
60|$|The prince {{received}} the cardinal very graciously, and heard {{what he had}} to say. The cardinal represented to him how overwhelming was the force which the King of France had brought against him, and how imminent the <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> he and all his forces would be totally destroyed in case of a conflict, and urged him, for the sake of humanity as well as from a proper regard for his own interest, to enter into negotiations for peace.|$|R

6000|$|... "The mine-owner, {{following}} his own inclinations, {{would take a}} little farm, grow potatoes, and live a beautiful life--perhaps write a little poetry. A slave to sense of duty, he is chained to the philanthropic work of gold-mining.

6000|$|... "My dear, you {{may depend}} upon my asking no leading {{questions}} whatever, and I shall behave {{with far more}} discretion than if you were with me. The <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> I shall behave with too much, for I find that my interest in their affair is very much faded. There is every probability that unless Glendenning speaks of his engagement it won't be spoken of at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why not, indeed?" [...] Alan {{echoed in}} turn. [...] "It's {{not at all}} that I disapprove, Miss Barton; on the contrary, I admire it; it's only that one's {{surprised}} to find a woman, or for the matter of that anybody, acting up {{to his or her}} convictions. That's what I've always felt; 'tis the Nemesis of reason; if people begin by thinking rationally, the <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they may end by acting rationally also." ...|$|E
5000|$|Ending the meeting, the Chairman said he {{was walking}} a tightrope. He was being pulled equally in both directions, he said. The <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> if he moved {{one way or another}} he would fall off the rope. But he {{observed}} <b>that</b> the text <b>was</b> only for launching new negotiations. [...] "The new round is where the real battle will begin," [...] he said. If the round is concluded, it will boost global welfare by tens of billions of dollars, he concluded.|$|R
50|$|How much truth {{there was}} in the Dalys' {{testimony}} is difficult to determine. As Geoghegan remarks, it <b>is</b> likely <b>that</b> {{a few of the}} accused were guilty at least of the attack on Norcott, but that most of them <b>were</b> innocent. The <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> no distinction would be made between innocent and guilty. That a major miscarriage of justice was averted owes a good deal to the eloquence of Daniel O'Connell but also a good deal to the integrity of the judges, especially Pennefather.|$|R
50|$|American {{convenience}} stores are often direct targets of armed robbery. In {{some areas of}} the United States, {{it is not unusual for}} clerks to be working behind bulletproof glass windows, even during daylight hours. Some {{convenience stores}} may even limit access inside at night, requiring customers to approach a walk-up window specifically for such situations to make purchases. The main <b>dangers</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> almost all convenience stores only have one person working night shift, most of the transactions are in cash, and easily resold merchandise, such as liquor, lottery tickets, and cigarettes, is on site.|$|R
6000|$|... "Only a few times," [...] he said; [...] "once, I believe, by Jam-bum, {{the famous}} Yogi of the Carnatic; once, perhaps twice, by Boohoo, {{the founder of}} the sect. But it is looked upon as {{extremely}} rare. Mr. Yahi tells me that the great <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> if the slightest part of the formula is incorrectly observed, the person attempting the astralization is swallowed up into nothingness. However, he declares himself willing to try." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{doctor is}} a {{different}} thing altogether!" [...] said Miss Cushing. [...] "If he comes and cures her, that's neither here nor there. It isn't the point! But the <b>danger</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that,</b> whether he comes or not, {{she is a woman}} well on in years, with a constitution breaking down under her,--that is as far as appearances go, for of course I can't say anything positive about it,--and she has nobody to inherit her money, and as far as anybody knows she has never made a will!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{culture of}} China is {{changing}} rapidly, and undoubtedly rapid change is needed. The change that has hitherto taken place is traceable ultimately {{to the military}} superiority of the West; but in future our economic superiority {{is likely to be}} quite as potent. I believe that, if the Chinese are left free to assimilate what they want of our civilization, and to reject what strikes them as bad, {{they will be able to}} achieve an organic growth from their own tradition, and to produce a very splendid result, combining our merits with theirs. There are, however, two opposite dangers to be avoided if this is to happen. The first <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they may become completely Westernized, retaining nothing of what has hitherto distinguished them, adding merely one more to the restless, intelligent, industrial, and militaristic nations which now afflict this unfortunate planet. The second <b>danger</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> they may be driven, in the course of resistance to foreign aggression, into an intense anti-foreign conservatism as regards everything except armaments. This has happened in Japan, and it may easily happen in China. The future of Chinese culture is intimately bound up with political and economic questions; and it is through their influence that dangers arise.|$|E
6000|$|The great <b>danger</b> now <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{we might}} <b>be</b> [...] "pooped," [...] {{which means that}} a huge wave might curl over our stern, fall with terrible fury on our deck, and sink us.|$|R
60|$|And so {{the matter}} went {{by with a}} laugh. But the grumbling continued, and the <b>danger</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the French would learn of it. The day passed, yet the embers blazed not into the flame of open mutiny. But he who has seen service knows how ominous is the {{gathering}} of men here and there, the low humming talk, the silence when a dissenter passes. There <b>were</b> fights, too, <b>that</b> had to <b>be</b> quelled by company captains, and no man knew when the loud quarrel between the two races at Vigo's store would grow into an ugly battle.|$|R
