5|$|The {{expedition}} greatly disturbed Russian and British {{influence in}} Central and South Asia, raising {{concerns about the}} security of their <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> Further, it nearly succeeded in propelling Afghanistan into the war.

5|$|North Vietnam's {{victory over}} the South led to a {{considerable}} shift in the political winds in Asia, and Ford administration officials worried about a consequent loss of U.S. influence there. The administration proved it was willing to respond forcefully to challenges to its <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> on two occasions, once when Khmer Rouge forces seized an American ship in international waters and again when American military officers {{were killed in the}} demilitarized zone (DMZ) between North and South Korea.|$|E

5|$|Portugal's wars against {{independence}} guerrilla {{fighters in}} its 400-year-old African territories began in 1961 with Angola. In Mozambique, the conflict erupted in 1964 {{as a result}} of unrest and frustration amongst many indigenous Mozambican populations, who perceived foreign rule to be a form of exploitation and mistreatment, which served only to further Portuguese economic <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> Many Mozambicans also resented Portugal's policies towards indigenous people, which resulted in discrimination, traditional lifestyle turning difficult for many Africans, and limited access to Portuguese-style education and skilled employment.|$|E
5|$|Protection of British <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> fell {{primarily}} to the Royal Navy, supported by the military forces of the East India Company. Naval strategy sought to eliminate enemy forces {{in the region and}} provide convoy protection to the large East Indiamen merchant ships and smaller company ships which transported goods and wealth between Britain and its Asian colonies and trade partners. The French Navy maintained commerce raiding operations in the region throughout the war; particularly light frigate squadrons and privateers deployed in an effort to disrupt British trade, supported as the conflict developed by the allies the French accrued {{in the course of the}} war, particularly the Batavian Republic and Spain.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hurricane}} of {{the season}} developed on September9 while located 160mi (260km) east-southeast of Socorro Island, and tied Hurricane Six as the strongest tropical cyclone {{of the season}}. The hurricane slowly turned northward, and made landfall in Baja California Sur with winds of 85mph (140km/h) on September 11. Hurricane Six dissipated over Baja California about 10hours later. Since Four was expected to bring high waves and rough seas to Southern California, all marine operates and other <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> were alerted.|$|E

5|$|Upon Jimena {{crossing}} Central America, the NHC {{noted the}} possibility locally heavy rainfall spreading {{across much of}} Central America and in extreme Southwestern Mexico. As the storm moved parallel to the Mexican coast, <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> were asked to watch {{the progress of the}} system and officials in the area opened shelters due to the risk of high winds. The Sonora state government issued a blue (initial) alert for 14municipalities on the southern portion of the state the afternoon of August 31. Later on the day, the blue alert was upgraded to a green alert, citing the risk of large rainfall amounts.|$|E
5|$|A {{second major}} policy {{directive}} that Raphel advocated and developed during her tenure was engagement and {{cooperation with the}} Taliban. Her positions raised equal measure of praise and scorn. U.S. energy policies in the mid-1990s sought to develop alternative supply routes to counter increasing tensions in the Middle East. The Clinton administration supported oil and gas pipelines to transport Turkmenistan's rich energy reserves through Afghanistan to an exit at Pakistan's Indian Ocean seaport of Gwadar. Raphel openly spoke {{in favor of a}} proposed pipeline project by Unocal Corporation, an American oil company, on trips to Afghanistan and Pakistan in April and August 1996. Overt Clinton administration support for the Unocal project, and the subsequent taking of Kabul in September 1996 by the Taliban, raised concerns in Russia and Iran that U.S. intelligence assets were behind the rise of Taliban control in Afghanistan to advance U.S. energy <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
5|$|Amiral Charner {{spent most}} of her career in the Mediterranean, {{although}} she was sent to China during the Boxer Rebellion of 1900–01. Together with her sisters, Chanzy and Latouche-Tréville, the ship was assigned to the International Squadron off the island of Crete during the Greco-Turkish War of 1897 to protect French interests and citizens. With the exception of Bruix, the sisters {{spent most of}} {{the first decade of the}} 20th century as training ships or in reserve. Bruix served in the Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean, and in the Far East before World War I. In 1902 she aided survivors of the devastating eruption of Mount Pelée on the island of Martinique and spent several years as guardship at Crete, protecting French <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> in the early 1910s. Chanzy was transferred to French Indochina in 1906. She ran aground off the Chinese coast in mid-1907, where she proved impossible to refloat and was destroyed in place after her crew was rescued without loss.|$|E

50|$|<b>In</b> 1826, <b>the</b> Royal Navy Great Britain {{established}} a South America Station in Valparaíso to maintain British naval <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> It would remain until 1837, {{when it was}} relocated to Esquimalt, British Columbia.|$|R
50|$|In February 1991, President Fernando Collor de Mello reaffirmed Brazil's <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> {{by visiting}} <b>the</b> Brazilian Antarctic base, {{where he spent}} three days.

5|$|Butler {{participated in}} a series of occupations, police actions, and {{interventions}} by the United States in Central America and the Caribbean, commonly called the Banana Wars because their goal was to protect American commercial <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> particularly those of the United Fruit Company. This company had significant financial stakes in the production of bananas, tobacco, sugar cane, and other products throughout the Caribbean, Central America and the northern portions of South America. The U.S. was also trying to advance its own political interests by maintaining its influence in the region and especially its control of the Panama Canal. These interventions started with the Spanish–American War in 1898 and ended with the withdrawal of troops from Haiti and President Franklin D. Roosevelt's Good Neighbor Policy in 1934. After his retirement, Butler became an outspoken critic of the business interests in the Caribbean, criticizing the ways in which U.S. businesses and Wall Street bankers imposed their agenda on United States foreign policy during this period.|$|E
5|$|Cormoran {{was built}} by the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig. Her keel was laid in 1890 and her {{completed}} hull was launched on 17 May 1892. Kaiser Wilhelm II attended the launching ceremony with the senior director of the Kaiserliche Werft. Work was completed by 25 July 1893, when she was commissioned into the Imperial German Navy. Following her commissioning, she underwent two months of sea trials, which were completed on 22 September. Starting in 1894, Cormoran was assigned to overseas service in Germany's colonial possessions. She was initially ordered on 2 October to the East Asia Station to replace the gunboat , but the rising tensions in South Africa led the Navy to send the new cruiser to German East Africa to secure German <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> instead.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{then began}} a peacetime {{training}} routine off {{the east coast}} of the United States and the Caribbean, including gunnery training off the Virginia Capes, training cruises in the Atlantic, and winter exercises in Cuban waters. In late 1909, Virginia, Georgia, and Rhode Island visited French and British ports. Throughout their careers, political unrest in several Central American countries prompted the United States to send the ships to protect American <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> New Jersey was sent to Cuba to assist the Cuban Pacification in support of the government of President Tomás Estrada Palma. All five ships became involved in the Mexican Revolution as the United States intervened to protect its nationals living in the country, culminating in the occupation of Veracruz in April 1914. New Jersey was also sent to protect American interests in Haiti and the Dominican unrest in 1914.|$|E
50|$|In March 1976, President Marcos {{issued the}} Letter of Instruction (LOI) No.1-76 {{organizing}} the AFP Western Command based in Palawan <b>in</b> response to <b>the</b> heightening conflict of <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> and to abate any untoward incident.|$|R
50|$|A {{decrease}} <b>in</b> Poland's <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> led Stephen to rebel. Again deposed, Iliaş was blinded (as custom prevented {{disabled people}} from ascending to the throne) and thrown in jail. He died there at an unknown time.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> 1942 <b>the</b> Tide Water Associated Oil Company was <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region</b> of {{southwest}} Saskatchewan {{for the development}} of oil.

5|$|The Abbasid–Saffarid {{partnership}} in Iran was most clearly expressed in their joint effort against the general Rafi ibn Harthama, {{who had made}} his base in Rayy and posed a threat to both caliphal and Saffarid <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> Al-Mu'tadid sent Ahmad ibn Abd al-Aziz to seize Rayy from Rafi, who fled and made common cause with the Zaydis of Tabaristan {{in an effort to}} seize Khurasan from the Saffarids. However, with Amr mobilizing the anti-Alid sentiments of the populace against him and the expected assistance from the Zaydis failing to materialize, Rafi was defeated and killed in Khwarazm in 896. Amr, now at the pinnacle of his power, sent the defeated rebel's head to Baghdad, and in 897 the Caliph transferred control of Rayy to him. The partnership finally collapsed after Mu'tadid appointed the Saffarid ruler Amr ibn al-Layth in 898 as governor of Transoxiana, which was ruled by his rivals, the Samanids. Al-Mu'tamid deliberately encouraged Amr to confront the Samanids, only for Amr to be crushingly defeated and taken prisoner by the latter in 900. The Samanid ruler, Isma'il ibn Ahmad, sent him in chains to Baghdad, where he was executed in 902, after al-Mu'tadid's death. Al-Mu'tadid in turn conferred Amr's titles and governorships to Isma'il ibn Ahmad. The Caliph also moved to regain Fars and Kirman, but the Saffarid remnant under Tahir proved sufficiently resilient to thwart the Abbasid attempts at capturing these two provinces for several years. It was not until 910 that the Abbasids managed to regain the coveted Fars province.|$|E
5|$|Though ancient {{rules of}} {{hospitality}} had protected the expedition, {{they knew that}} once {{they were out of}} the Emir's lands, the Anglo-Russian forces as well as the marauding tribesmen of Persia would chase them mercilessly. The party split up into several groups, each independently making its way back to Germany. Niedermayer headed west, attempting to run the Anglo-Russian Cordon and escape through Persia, while von Hentig made for the route over the Pamir Mountains towards Chinese Central Asia. Having served in Peking before the war, von Hentig was familiar with the region and planned to make Yarkand a base from which to make a last attempt to create local Muslim unrest against Anglo-Russian <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> He later escaped over the Hindu Kush, avoiding his pursuers for 130 days {{as he made his way}} on foot and horseback through Chinese Turkestan, over the Gobi Desert, and through China and Shanghai. From there, he stowed away on an American vessel to Honolulu. Following the American declaration of war, he was exchanged as a diplomat. Travelling via San Francisco, Halifax, and Bergen, he finally reached Berlin on 9 June 1917. Meanwhile, Niedermayer escaped towards Persia through Russian Turkestan. Robbed and left for dead, a wounded Niedermayer was at times reduced to begging before he finally reached friendly lines, arriving in Tehran on 20 July 1916. Wagner left Herat on 25 October 1917, making his way through northern Persia to reach Turkey on 30 January 1918. At Chorasan, he tried to rally Persian democratic and nationalist leaders, who promised to raise an army of 12,000 if Germany provided military assistance.|$|E
25|$|The City of Los Angeles {{continued}} to purchase private land holdings and their water rights {{to meet the}} increasing demands.

50|$|In 1957, Silverman {{enrolled}} at <b>the</b> PhD program <b>in</b> Anthropology at Columbia University.

50|$|<b>In</b> 1852 <b>the</b> Boer {{government}} <b>in</b> Transvaal made {{a treaty}} with Mzilikazi.

His son, Lobengula, succeeded him as king.|$|R
50|$|By {{the late}} nineteenth century, there was {{international}} <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> European travelers had published drawings and reports of the Marcahuamachuco ruins.

25|$|JC has an {{interest}} of just over 50% in Astra, a listed Indonesian conglomerate and the largest independent automotive group in Southeast Asia, {{as well as other}} motor <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b> Together with its subsidiaries and associates, Jardine Cycle & Carriage employs some 201,000 people across Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Vietnam.|$|E
25|$|The {{automotive}} industry is also becoming increasingly {{important for the}} Middle Tennessee region. Nissan North America moved its corporate headquarters in 2006 from Gardena, California (Los Angeles County) to Franklin, southwest of Nashville. Nissan also has its largest North American manufacturing plant in Smyrna, Tennessee. Largely {{as a result of}} the increased development of Nissan and other Japanese economic <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> Japan moved its former New Orleans consulate-general to Nashville's Palmer Plaza.|$|E
25|$|Also, in op-ed pieces {{written in}} 1998 and 2000 for The New York Times, Mearsheimer {{supported}} India's decision to acquire nuclear weapons. In {{support of this}} position, he argued that India has good strategic reasons to want a nuclear deterrent, especially in order to balance against China and Pakistan, guaranteeing regional stability. He also criticized United States counter-proliferation policy towards India, which he considered unrealistic and harmful to American <b>interests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region.</b>|$|E
50|$|However, the French {{did have}} an <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>region,</b> and <b>the</b> treaty was {{enforced}} from its signing by various factions.
