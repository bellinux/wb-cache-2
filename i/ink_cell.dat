However, {{in the natural}} killer (NK) cell subset of large granular lymphocyte proliferations, clonality is difficult to prove {{because of the lack}} of specific genetic markers, such as immunoglobulin or T-cell receptor gene rearrangements. The human androgen receptor (HUMARA) assay, a polymerase chain reaction-based X-chromosome inactivation assay, is a potential diagnostic tool in these disorders. Although there is much experience with X-chromosome inactivation assays in myeloid proliferations, these assays have found only very limited application in clonality assessment of NK cell proliferations. We applied the HUMARA assay in laboratory diagnostics for detection of clonality in NK cell proliferations.

The mechanisms controlling proliferation and differentiation of these cells are unknown. Here we demonstrate that the IL- 1 receptor IL- 1 R 1 was selectively expressed by a subpopulation of <b>iNK</b> <b>cells</b> that localized proximal to IL- 1 β-producing conventional dendritic cells (cDCs) within SLT. IL- 1 R 1 hi <b>iNK</b> <b>cells</b> required continuous exposure to IL- 1 β to retain AHR and IL- 22 expression, and they proliferate in direct response to cDC-derived IL- 15 and IL- 1 β. In the absence of IL- 1 β, a substantially greater fraction of IL- 1 R 1 hi <b>iNK</b> <b>cells</b> differentiated to stage 4 NK cells and acquired the ability to kill and secrete IFN-γ. Thus, cDC-derived IL- 1 β preserves and expands IL- 1 R 1 hiIL- 22 +AHR+ <b>iNK</b> <b>cells,</b> potentially influencing human mucosal innate immunity during infection...|$|R

Recent studies identified CD 4 + and CD 4 – CD 8 – double-negative (DN) <b>iNK</b> T <b>cells</b> {{as the two}} major components of the human population and suggest that they display a Th 2 and a Th 1 profile, respectively. We compared the Th 2 -promoting activity of freshly isolated human CD 4 + and DN <b>iNK</b> T <b>cells</b> {{in terms of their}} capacity to induce Ig production by autologous B cells. Secretion of IgG and IgE but not IgM was enhanced by the CD 4 + T <b>cell</b> subset (including <b>iNK</b> T <b>cells)</b> but not by its DN counterpart. <b>iNK</b> T <b>cells</b> were directly responsible for this pro-Th 2 effect, as demonstrated by the requirement for both α-GC stimulation and CD 1 d presentation, as well as by its disappearance upon <b>iNK</b> T <b>cell</b> depletion. Interaction with <b>iNK</b> T <b>cells</b> led to progressive accumulation of isotype-switched and activated B cells. Myeloid dendritic cells (DC) completely block the induction of Ig production in co-culture. This dominant inhibitory effect of myeloid DC was concomitant with a specific loss of interleukin (IL) - 4 production by CD 4 + iNK T but not by conventional T cells. These data support the conclusion that, conversely to the interferon (IFN) -γ-producing DN human <b>iNK</b> T <b>cell</b> population, interleukin (IL) - 4 -producing CD 4 + <b>iNK</b> T <b>cells</b> can activate and help B cells to produce both IgG and IgE through a CD 1 d-dependent mechanism, in keeping with a functional Th 1 /Th 2 dichotomy between these subsets...|$|R

Upon stimulation in vitro, CD 161 (+) T cells produced IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha but not IL- 4.

40|$|Natural killer (NK) {{cells are}} a {{component}} of the innate immunity against viral infections through their rapid cytotoxic activity and cytokine production. Although the synthetic double-stranded (ds) RNA polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (poly I:C), a mimic of a common product of viral infections, is known to rapidly up-regulate their in vivo functions, <b>INK</b> <b>cell</b> ability to directly respond to dsRNA is still mostly unknown. Our results show that treatment with poly I:C significantly up-regulates both natural and CD 16 -mediated cytotoxicity of highly purified human NK cells. Poly I:C also induces the novel capability of producing CXCL 10 chemokine in human NK cells and synergistically enhances interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production induced by either adaptive or innate cytokines. In accordance with the expression of Toll-like receptor- 3 (TLR 3) and of TRIF/TICAM- 1 adaptor, poly I:C stimulation induces the activation of interferon regulatory factor- 3 (IRF- 3) transcription factor and of p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in human NK cells. Finally, we demonstrate that p 38 MAPK activity is required for the dsRNA-dependent enhancement of cytotoxicity and CXCL 10 production. The occurrence of dsRNA-induced signaling and functional events closely correlates with the TLR 3 mRNA profile in different NK cell populations. Taken together, these data identify p 38 as a central component of NK cell ability to directly respond to dsRNA pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP).

After an initial response to α-GalCer, <b>iNK</b> T <b>cells</b> become anergic upon restimulation. While such anergic <b>iNK</b> T <b>cells</b> can induce tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) that mediate protection from T 1 D, chronic administration of α-GalCer also results in long-lasting anergy accompanied by significantly reduced <b>iNK</b> T <b>cell</b> frequencies, which raises concerns about its long-term therapeutic use. In this study, our objective was to understand more clearly the roles of anergy and induction of tolerogenic DCs in iNK T cell-mediated protection from T 1 D and to circumvent potential complications associated with α-GalCer. We demonstrate that NOD <b>iNK</b> T <b>cells</b> activated during multi-dose (MD) treatment in vivo with C 20 : 2 enter into and exit from anergy more rapidly than after activation by α-GalCer. Importantly, this shorter duration of <b>iNK</b> T <b>cells</b> in the anergic state promotes the more rapid induction of tolerogenic DCs and reduced <b>iNK</b> T <b>cell</b> death, and enables C 20 : 2 stimulated <b>iNK</b> T <b>cells</b> to elicit enhanced protection from T 1 D.

B cells proliferate and IgG anti-NP is produced from in vivo-immunized mice and in vitro cocultures of B and NK T cells after exposure to NP-αGalCer, but not closely related control glycolipids. This B cell response is absent in CD 1 d−/− and Jα 18 −/− mice but not CD 4 −/− mice.

The LT-HSC kinome is characterized by noncanonical Wnt, Ca 2 +and classical protein kinase C (PKC) -driven signaling, which is lost upon the transition to ST-HSC, whose kinome signature prominently features receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) activation of the Ras/MAPK signaling cassette. Further differentiation to iNK maintains signaling through this cassette but simultaneously leads to activation of a PI 3 K/PKB/Rac signaling, which becomes the dominant trait in the kinase signature following full differentiation toward NK cells. Differentiation along the myeloid and B cell lineages is accompanied by hyperactivation of both the Ras/MAPK and PI 3 K/PKB/Rac signaling cassette.

We show that treatment of NOD mice with C 20 : 2 diminished the activation of ‘inflammatory’ interleukin (IL) - 12 producing CD 11 chighCD 8 + myeloid dendritic cells (mDCs) and augmented the function of ‘tolerogenic’ DCs more effectively than treatment with the prototypical iNKT cell activator KRN 7000 (α-GalCer C 26 : 0) that induces Th 1 - and Th 2 -type responses. These findings correlate with a reduced capacity of C 20 : 2 to sustain the early transactivation of T, B and NK cells.

The effect of inhibition of Notch signaling was studied starting from cord blood CD 34 (+) or thymic CD 34 (+) CD 1 (-), CD 34 (+) CD 1 (+), or CD 4 ISP progenitors. Treatment of cord blood CD 34 (+) cells with low DAPT concentrations results in aberrant CD 4 ISP and CD 4 /CD 8 double-positive (DP) thymocytes, which are negative for intracellular T-cell receptor beta (TCR beta).

40|$|During early pregnancy, uterine mucosa decidualization is {{accompanied}} by a drastic enrichment of CD 56 (high) CD 16 (-) natural killer (NK) cells. Decidual NK (dNK) cells differ from peripheral blood NK (pbNK) cells in several ways, but their origin is still unclear. Our results demonstrate that chemokines present in the uterus can support pbNK cell migration through human endothelial and stromal decidual cells. Notably, we observed that pregnant women's pbNK cells are endowed with higher migratory ability compared with nonpregnant women's or male donors' pbNK cells. Moreover, NK cell migration through decidual stromal cells was increased when progesterone-cultured stromal cells were used as substrate, and this correlated with the ability of progesterone to up-regulate stromal cell chemokine expression. Furthermore, we demonstrate that dNK cells migrate through stromal cells using a distinct pattern of chemokines. Finally, we found that pbNK cells acquire a chemokine receptor pattern similar to that of dNK cells when they contact decidual stromal cells. Collectively these results strongly suggest that pbNK cell recruitment to the uterus contributes to the accumulation of <b>INK</b> <b>cells</b> during early pregnancy; that progesterone plays a crucial role in this event; and that pbNK cells undergo reprogramming of their chemokine receptor profile once exposed to uterine microenvironment...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} {{the role of}} CD 4 +CD 25 + regulatory T cells {{in the development of}} 3 -methylcholanthrene (MCA) -induced tumors. Immunization of wild-type BALB/c mice with a series of SEREX (serological identification of antigens by recombinant expression cloning) -defined broadly expressed self-antigens results in the development of highly active CD 4 +CD 25 + regulatory T cells. Accelerated tumor development was observed in mice immunized with self-antigens and was abolished by antibody-mediated depletion of CD 4 + T cells or CD 25 + T cells. A similar acceleration of tumorigenesis was also observed in mice adoptively transferred 2 or 4 weeks after MCA injection with CD 4 +CD 25 + T cells derived from mice immunized with DnaJ-like 2, one of these self-antigens. Experiments with Jα 281 -/- mice lacking invariant natural killer (<b>iNK)</b> T <b>cells</b> indicated that <b>iNK</b> T <b>cells,</b> known for their protective {{role in the development of}} MCA-induced tumors, were suppressed in immunized hosts. NK cells, also known to play a protective role in MCA induced-tumorigenesis, were also suppressed in mice immunized with serologically defined self-antigens in a CD 4 +CD 25 + T cell-dependent manner. We propose that CD 4 +CD 25 + regulatory T cells generated by immunization with these self-antigens enhance susceptibility to MCA induced-tumorigenesis by down-regulating iNK T and NK reactivity, and suggest that these observations provide direct evidence for the existence of cancer immunosurveillance in this system of chemical carcinogenesis...|$|R
40|$|Neuroblastoma is an {{aggressive}} solid tumor that develops from immature {{cells of the}} nervous system and is almost exclusively diagnosed in infants and young children. Over the past decade a multitude of immune based therapies have been explored as therapeutic candidates for patients with neuroblastoma. The anti-GD 2 monoclonal antibody, 3 F 8, and more recently, natural kill (NK) cell based therapies have been accepted as hopeful therapeutic options for patients with Neuroblastoma. These options however have many drawbacks including dose limiting pain, the development of tolerance, reliance on MHC mismatch and possible reliance on the invariant NK (<b>iNK)</b> <b>cells</b> population. Gamma Delta T cells, a subpopulation of T cells composed of a T cell receptor (TCR) with a gamma and a delta chain instead of an alpha and a beta; chain, have been shown to recruit a more robust immune response then both 3 F 8 and NK cells through their activation of antigen presenting cells (APCs) and non-reliance on MHC mismatch. Gamma Delta T cells are also able to recruit NK cells as well as other cytotoxic lymphocytes. For these reasons, it is believed that Gamma Delta T cell based treatment alone or in combination with an anti-GD 2 monoclonal antibody may have a greater efficacy than either NK cells or an anti-GD 2 monoclonal antibody alone. The intent of this thesis is to explore and evaluate the current state of Gamma Delta T cell based immunotherapy against the backdrop of NK cell based immunotherapy for neuroblastoma...|$|R

40|$|Background. Hashimoto's {{thyroiditis}} (HT) {{results from}} a parenchymal infiltration by Th 1 T cell clones that ultimately may cause tissue destruction. We analysed here whether the quantitative assessment of the cytokine profile in peripheral lymphocytes could help {{for the evaluation of}} patients with HT. Methods. We added to a flow cytometric evaluation of lymphocyte subpopulations, an assay to identify specific Th 1 and Th 2 functional subsets. Whole blood diluted in RPM 1 was activated with PMA and ionomycin for 4 h at 37 degreesC in the presence of brefeldin. Immunophenotyping of samples was performed with PerCP-Cy 5. 5 -conjugated CD 3, and APC-conjugated CD 4 antibodies. After staining for surface antigens, red cells were lysed and white cells were permeabilized. Intracellular cytokines were detected with FITC-conjugated INFgamma (Th 1) and PE-conjugated IL- 4 (Th 2) monoclonal antibodies (mabs). Results. Twenty-three consecutive patients were selected based on the detection of anti TPO ab concentration equal or higher than 600 UI/L. They were compared to 17 healthy control subjects (with undetectable TPO abs). The lymphocyte count and the proportion of the different lymphocyte subsets (T <b>cells,</b> B <b>cells,</b> <b>INK</b> <b>cells,</b> T-CD 4 (+), T-CD 8 (+), Th 1 CD 3, Th 2 CD 3, Th 1 CD 4, Th 2 CD 4 cells) were alike when both groups were compared. A significant difference appeared when the Th 1 /Th 2 ratio measured on CD 3 T cells was considered. This ratio was significantly increased in HT patients when compared to controls (24. 91 +/- 2. 9 vs. 15. 5 +/- 1. 4 (mean SEM); p 0. 05). Conclusions. Our data indicate that the Th 1 context analysed in peripheral lymphocytes is dominant in HT patients. Flowcytometry {{could be used as a}} diagnostic tool to better understand the pathogeny and the outcome of destructive autoimmune thyroiditis...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: We {{investigate}} whether p 16 INK 4 and p 15 INK 4 B inhibit cellular proliferation and exert a growth suppressive effect on esophageal cancer cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The growth suppressive effects of p 6 INK 4 and p 15 INK 4 B {{were evaluated by}} transfecting vectors containing the p 16 INK 4 cDNA or the p 15 INK 4 B cDNA, or both, constitutively driven by a cytomegalovirus promoter, into two human esophageal cancer cell lines containing or lacking endogenous p 16 INK 4 and/or p 15 INK 4 B. RESULTS: These experiments demonstrated that in both cells lines tested, the numbers of cells surviving dramatically decreased in p 16 INK 4 -transfected and p 15 <b>INK</b> 4 B-transfected <b>cells</b> compared with control vector-transfected cells. There {{was no significant difference}} in the degree of growth inhibition between p 16 INK 4 -transfected and p 15 <b>INK</b> 4 B-transfected <b>cell</b> lines. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that p 16 INK 4 and p 15 INK 4 B play important roles in the initiation or promotion of esophageal cancer. The inactivation of p 16 INK 4 and p 15 INK 4 B may contribute to uncontrolled growth in human cancer...|$|R

HuL- 4 cell strain was published as an epithelial cell strain in {{the previous}} paper. We examined the cell morphologically, histochemically, and the cellular localisation of albumin and AFP (α-fetoprotein) immunofluorescently. Chromosome of the cells and uptake of Indian <b>ink</b> into the <b>cell</b> were also undertaken. We also calculated the growth curve of the strain and analyzed the liver specific enzymes. The results are summarized as follows. 1). HuL- 4 cell strain derived from human embryonic liver disclosed dominant epithelial cell growth than fibroblastic cells, and it continued to cultivate up to 24 passages in 758 days. 2). Direct immunofluorescence method for albumin and AFP failed to show any positive stain. 3). PAS staining of the cell revealed weak positive, and it was digested by diastase. PAP silver staining was negative, and the uptake of Indian <b>ink</b> into the <b>cells</b> was negative for up to 12 hours. 4). Chromosome analysis of the cell was normal (46 numbers, diploid) and no marker chromosomes were detected. 5).
