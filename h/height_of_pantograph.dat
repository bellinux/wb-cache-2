30|$|A {{great deal}} of {{research}} {{has been carried out}} to investigate the aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>pantographs</b> <b>of</b> high-speed trains. Zhang et al.

[7] studied the unsteady aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>pantographs</b> <b>of</b> high-speed trains with and without crosswind conditions using the detached eddy simulation method. Li et al. [8] analyzed the aerodynamic forces <b>of</b> <b>pantographs</b> with knuckle-downstream and knuckle-upstream orientation through a numerical simulation based on the three-dimensional (3 D) steady Reynolds Average Navier–Stokes (RANS) method, and the simulation results were basically consistent with the experimental results. Fu et al. [9] studied the aerodynamic forces <b>of</b> <b>pantographs</b> and the vibration characteristics induced by winds through wind tunnel tests. Pombo et al. [10] analyzed the influence of the aerodynamic forces on the pantograph–catenary system for high-speed trains under crosswinds using numerical simulations and experiments. Lee et al. [11] performed wind tunnel tests <b>of</b> <b>pantographs</b> with different arms and optimized the panhead shape. Du et al. [12] numerically calculated the flow field around a pantograph and analyzed the aeroacoustic characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>pantograph.</b>|$|R

50|$|As on the Class 7E, the locomotive's {{pantograph}} {{contact shoe}} centres are directly above the bogie pivot centres {{to reduce the}} possibility <b>of</b> <b>pantograph</b> hookups on catenary in sharp curves, such as in turnouts, {{as a result of}} sideways movement <b>of</b> the <b>pantograph</b> in relation to the overhead wire.|$|R
30|$|However, the {{research}} about the aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>pantographs</b> {{in the above}} literature mainly focused on the pantograph itself and neglected {{the influence of the}} train body on the aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> <b>pantographs.</b> As the thickness of the boundary layer increases along the opposite running direction of the train, the pantograph fixing position would have significant influences on the aerodynamic characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>pantographs</b> and the train body [13]. In the present paper, aerodynamic models of high-speed trains with pantographs fixed on different positions are established based on the theory of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The external flow fields of the high-speed trains are numerically simulated using the software STAR-CCM+. In addition, influences <b>of</b> the <b>pantograph</b> fixing position on the aerodynamic characteristics of the high-speed train and pantographs are analyzed.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the <b>{{pantograph}}</b> noise <b>of</b> Shinkansen rolling stock, large pantograph covers had been attached around conventional pantographs.

So, we have recently developed low-noise pantographs and low-noise insulators 1) to replace pantograph covers. For the FASTECH 360 S high-speed test train on which we have been proceeding with development with a target of achieving 360 km/h, further reduction <b>of</b> <b>pantograph</b> noise is required.

50|$|The {{most common}} type <b>of</b> <b>pantograph</b> today is the {{so-called}} half-pantograph (sometimes 'Z'-shaped), which has evolved {{to provide a more}} compact and responsive single-arm design at high speeds as trains get faster.

30|$|At present, the {{coupling}} relationship between the pantograph and catenary is not ideal for straddle-type monorail. The power collection quality is poor, and the wear of the contact strip of a pantograph is uneven. Therefore, the key problem of coupling {{relation between the}} pantograph and catenary is the dynamics of a pantograph–catenary system. This paper analyzed the modal of catenary through simulation with finite element model and the vibration modal <b>of</b> <b>pantograph</b> multi-rigid-body dynamic model by simulation in multi-body danamics software ADAMS. A rigid-flexible coupling dynamic model of pantograph–catenary system is established. Finally, extensive research has been made on the influence <b>of</b> <b>pantograph</b> head parameters on the power collection quality.|$|R

40|$|The {{method by}} which current is {{collected}} from overhead contact lines over the tracks via pantographs is widely used to supply power to EMUs and electric locomotives. Pantographs were first installed to trains in operation in Japan in 1914. Then, in 1922, the former Japanese National Railways completed the installation <b>of</b> <b>pantographs</b> to all electric locomotives and EMUs. Thus, pantographs have been playing the main role in current collection for rolling stock in Japan for nearly a century. The most important function required <b>of</b> <b>pantographs</b> is to collect the required current efficiently to vehicles when needed. To do that, pantographs need to have conductivity and capacity appropriate to their usage. These functions also should be maintained even in high speed running. Factors that determine the current collectivity <b>of</b> <b>pantographs</b> are largely classified into two factors: dynamic performance <b>of</b> the <b>pantograph</b> and wear resistance between the contact strip and the contact wire. Pantographs absolutely must follow the vertical deviation of the contact wire even in high speed running without fail. Contact strips are installed to the top <b>of</b> a <b>pantograph</b> that contacts the contact wire, (Fig. 1). If a pantograph cannot follow the contact wire and contact strips lose contact to the wire while large current is flowing, arcs are generated or current collection worsens. Such a situation is called contact loss. Arcs caused by contact loss increase wear of contact strips and contact wire; and in worse case scenarios, they break both. If contact wire or contact strips wear easily or cause wear on each other, that results in shorter lifespan and increase in maintenance expenses. Based on these factors, the Technical Center is carrying out R&D projects with an aim of extending lifespan of both of contact wires and contact strips by decreasing wear of those. Here I wil...|$|R

30|$|With the {{increase}} in the train speed, the interaction between the train and the air becomes more severe, and it leads to a series of aerodynamic problems, such as aerodynamic drag force, lift force, aerodynamic noise [1]. The aerodynamic drag force is proportional to the square of the train speed. When the train speed reaches 200 – 300  km/h, the aerodynamic drag accounts for 70 % to 85 % of the total drag of the train [1, 2]. The aerodynamic drag <b>of</b> <b>pantographs</b> accounts for 8 % to 14 % of the total aerodynamic drag, and the aerodynamic lift <b>of</b> <b>pantographs</b> is proportional to the square of the train speed [3].
