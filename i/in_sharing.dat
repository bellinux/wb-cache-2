Holden has offered badge engineered models <b>in</b> <b>sharing</b> arrangements with Chevrolet, Isuzu, Nissan, Opel, Suzuki, Toyota and Vauxhall Motors.

5|$|The Daelaam are {{the unified}} protoss {{protectorate}} organization representing all known protoss kindred, races, castes, and factions. Before the Brood Wars, Protoss society was divided—the Khalai of the Protoss Empire, the exiled Nerazim, the heretic Tal'Darim, and the hibernating Purifiers. Because of the Great War and subsequent Brood War, the former body collapsed and all branches of protoss {{were forced to}} band together <b>in</b> <b>sharing</b> knowledge, integrating technology, and for mutual survival.|$|E
5|$|One {{behavior}} is recruitment, where juvenile ravens call other ravens {{to a food}} bonanza, usually a carcass, {{with a series of}} loud yells. In Ravens in Winter, Bernd Heinrich posited that this behavior evolved to allow the juveniles to outnumber the resident adults, thus allowing them to feed on the carcass without being chased away. A more mundane explanation is that individuals co-operate <b>in</b> <b>sharing</b> information about carcasses of large mammals because they are too big for just a few birds to exploit. Experiments with baits however show that such recruitment behaviour is independent {{of the size of the}} bait.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to being merchants, monks, and government officials, Sogdians also served as soldiers in the Tang military. An Lushan, whose father was Sogdian and mother a Gokturk, rose {{to the position of}} a military governor (jiedushi) in the northeast before leading the An Lushan Rebellion (755 – 763 AD), which split the loyalties of the Sogdians in China. The An Lushan rebellion was supported by many Sogdians, and in its aftermath many of them were slain or changed their names to escape their Sogdian heritage, so that {{little is known about the}} Sogdian presence in North China since that time. Sogdians continued as active traders in China following the defeat of the rebellion, but many of them were compelled to hide their ethnic identity. A prominent case was An Chongzhang, Minister of War, and Duke of Liang who, in 756, asked Emperor Suzong of Tang to allow him to change his name to Li Baoyu because of his shame <b>in</b> <b>sharing</b> the same surname with the rebel leader. This change of surnames was enacted retroactively for all of his family members, so that his ancestors would also be bestowed the surname Li.|$|E

40|$|The {{stock of}} firms that issue equity has, on average, {{performed}} poorly in subsequent years, while {{the stock of}} firms that repurchase has typically done well. One explanation for this pattern is that firms are exploiting their superior knowledge {{about the value of}} their stock by buying it when it is undervalued and selling it when it is overvalued. This paper presents supporting evidence for this explanation of the excess returns: The change <b>in</b> <b>shares</b> outstanding is positively correlated with proxies for the deviation of current stock price from fundamental value; the excess returns following the change <b>in</b> <b>shares</b> remain significant after controlling for these proxies; and the changes <b>in</b> <b>shares</b> that {{can be explained by the}} proxies predict stock returns more powerfully than changes <b>in</b> <b>shares</b> explained by other reasons...|$|R

25|$|The {{cooperative}} breeding hypothesis {{predicts that}} cotton-top tamarins engage with this young-rearing paradigm, {{and in turn}} naturally embrace patterns of prosocial behavior.

Though some studies indicate that cotton-top tamarins have the psychological capacity to participate in reciprocally mediated altruism, {{it is unclear whether}} the cotton-top tamarin acts solely using judgements on reinforcement history.|$|E
25|$|The {{majority}} of Somalis, in the UK and elsewhere, are Muslims. The majority {{adhere to the}} Sunni branch of Islam and the Shafi`i school of Islamic jurisprudence.

Mosques are the primary centres for religious and social gatherings, and also play an important role <b>in</b> <b>sharing</b> information. Traditionally, Somalis attended masjids established by the more settled Muslim communities from Asian and Arab countries, though there are now a small number of mosques operated by Somalis.|$|E
25|$|Vanunu {{states in}} his letters that he {{intended}} to share the money received from the newspaper (for the information) with the Anglican Church of Australia. Meanwhile, Guerrero, despite having met Hounam and Vanunu at the airport when they arrived in London and receiving an assurance from Hounam that he would get his money, sold the story to the tabloid Sunday Mirror, whose owner was Robert Maxwell. In 1991, a self-described former Mossad officer or government translator named Ari Ben-Menashe claimed that Maxwell, allegedly an agent for Israeli intelligence services, had tipped off the Israeli Embassy about Vanunu in 1986. <b>In</b> <b>sharing</b> his story with the Sunday Mirror, Guerrero forfeited the agreed-upon payment of $25,000 from The Sunday Times.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the debate on revenue sharing by considering the effect of an increase <b>in</b> <b>shared</b> league-revenue on competitive balance in a league comprised of profit-maximising clubs compared with a league comprised of win-maximising clubs. Taking into account {{the effect of the}} relative (but not absolute) quality of the teams on the clubs' revenues, it is shown that under win maximisation increases <b>in</b> <b>shared</b> league-revenue tend to increase competitive balance and raise player wages. This is different from the case of profit maximisation, where increases <b>in</b> <b>shared</b> league-revenue have no impact on either competitive balance or player wages...|$|R

Also, because {{of the terms of}} its leasing agreement with Staples Center, the Kings and Lakers had scheduling priority over the Clippers, with the Clippers taking whatever dates that were available, including scheduling same-day Clipper-Laker and Clipper-King doubleheaders (which continues as of 2016). However, in the years after, the Clippers' scheduling at Staples Center became gradually more favorable (especially given the popularity of the team in recent years) in their lease renewals in 2004 and 2013, with the team receiving increased profits, including more of a share of luxury suite and concession revenue. Since February 2011, the Clippers have sold out every regular season and post-season home game, behind the popularity of stars Blake Griffin, DeAndre Jordan, and Chris Paul.|$|E
