5|$|The Moon {{has long}} been {{associated}} with <b>insanity</b> and irrationality; the words lunacy and lunatic (popular shortening loony) are derived from the Latin name for the Moon, Luna. Philosophers Aristotle and Pliny the Elder argued that the full moon induced <b>insanity</b> in susceptible individuals, believing that the brain, which is mostly water, must {{be affected by the}} Moon and its power over the tides, but the Moon's gravity is too slight to affect any single person. Even today, people who believe in a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals, traffic accidents, homicides or suicides increase during a full moon, but dozens of studies invalidate these claims.|$|E
5|$|The {{validity}} of these accounts is debatable. In Roman political culture, <b>insanity</b> and sexual perversity were often presented hand-in-hand with poor government.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the ability}} to shapeshift into human form, encantados {{frequently}} wield other magical abilities, such as the power to control storms, enchant humans into doing their will, transform humans into encantados themselves, and inflict illness, <b>insanity,</b> and even death. Shamans often intervene in these situations.|$|E

5|$|By the 19th-century, the act {{of suicide}} had shifted from being viewed as caused by sin to being caused by <b>insanity</b> in Europe. Although suicide {{remained}} illegal during this period, it increasingly became the target of satirical comments, such as the Gilbert and Sullivan musical The Mikado that satirized the idea of executing someone who had already killed himself.|$|E
5|$|In The Warlord Chronicles (1995–97), Bernard Cornwell makes Portland the Isle of the Dead, a {{place of}} {{internal}} exile, where the causeway was guarded to keep the 'dead' (people suffering <b>insanity)</b> from crossing the Fleet and returning to the mainland. No historical evidence exists to support this idea.|$|E
5|$|The not-guilty verdict led to {{widespread}} dismay, and, as a result, the U.S. Congress {{and a number}} of states rewrote laws regarding the <b>insanity</b> defense. The old Model Penal Code test was replaced by a test that shifts the burden of proof regarding a defendant's sanity from the prosecution to the defendant. Three states have abolished the defense altogether.|$|E

50|$|By March 2009, {{the only}} {{remaining}} members of Candiria were John LaMacchia and Carley Coma; Coma had stated that any future Candiria efforts {{will most likely be}} electronica-based projects as they are without a rhythm section, however, by mid-2009, Mike MacIvor had returned to the band. In August 2009, the band released Toying with the <b>Insanities</b> Volume I on gatefold CD, followed by Toying with the <b>Insanities</b> Volume II in September 2009. The albums contain remixed versions of the band's prior material. For the near future, Kenneth Schalk and John LaMacchia have come together to start working on instrumental tracks for what will become another Toying with the <b>Insanities</b> release.|$|R
5|$|Use of <b>insanity</b> as {{a concept}} dates from 1324, and its {{criminal}} application was used until the late 16th century in an almost identical way. The defence, if successful, either allowed the defendant to return home or led to him being incarcerated until he was granted a royal pardon; after 1542, a defendant who became insane prior to the trial could not be tried for any crime, {{up to and including}} high treason. During the 18th century the test to determine <b>insanity</b> became extremely narrow, with defendants required to prove that they could not distinguish between good and evil and that they suffered from a mental disease which made them incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions. The current wording comes from the M'Naghten Rules, based on the trial of Daniel M'Naghten in 1843.|$|E
5|$|After {{a mental}} evaluation, a {{psychologist}} concluded Clemmons was competent {{to stand trial}} on the charges, which eliminated him {{as a candidate for}} involuntary commitment. An attorney for Clemmons notified the court he planned to pursue an <b>insanity</b> or diminished-capacity defense. On November 23, 2009, Clemmons paid $15,000 for a $190,000 bail bond from Jail Sucks Bail Bonds, a Chehalis-based company, to secure his release. Two other bail bond agencies had rejected Clemmons based on his history of failing to appear in court.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{suffered}} {{the first of}} what was to become a lifelong series of bouts of <b>insanity</b> in 1392 when, on a hot August day outside Le Mans, he attacked his household knights, including his brother Orléans, killing four men. After the attack he fell into a coma that lasted four days. Few believed he would recover; his uncles, the dukes of Burgundy and Berry, took advantage of his illness and quickly seized power, re-establishing themselves as regents and dissolving the Marmouset council.|$|E

5|$|Charles' {{bouts of}} illness {{continued}} unabated until his death.

5|$|Earlier travels had exposed Géricault {{to victims}} of <b>insanity</b> and plague, and while researching the Méduse his effort to be {{historically}} accurate and realistic led to an obsession with the stiffness of corpses. To achieve the most authentic rendering of the flesh tones of the dead, he made sketches of bodies in the morgue of the Hospital Beaujon, studied the faces of dying hospital patients, brought severed limbs back to his studio to study their decay, and for a fortnight drew a severed head, borrowed from a lunatic asylum and stored on his studio roof.|$|E
5|$|Guiteau {{was indicted}} on October 14, 1881, {{for the murder}} of the President. In a chaotic trial in which Guiteau often {{interrupted}} and argued, and in which his counsel used the <b>insanity</b> defense, the jury found him guilty on January 5, 1882, and he was sentenced to death by hanging. Guiteau might have had neurosyphilis, a disease that causes physiological mental impairment. He was executed on June 30, 1882.|$|E

Searching his former mentor's possessions, Norman discovers an experimental strength/intelligence enhancement formula, but in attempting to create the serum, it turns green and explodes in his face. The accident greatly increases his intelligence and physical abilities as intended, but also has the side-effect of driving him into destructive <b>insanity.</b>|$|E
5|$|However, Nosanchuk {{was still}} not certain that he would attempt to defend Lamb on mental grounds. In Ontario at that time, a {{defendant}} found not guilty under these terms remained imprisoned indefinitely unless an order for his release came from the province's Executive Council, acting {{on the advice of}} a Review Board including a Supreme Court Judge. Yaworsky warned Nosanchuk that even if he used an <b>insanity</b> defence and won, Lamb would probably be committed to an institution for the criminally insane for life. It was still possible for the lawyer to approach the prosecution and propose a plea bargain, offering to plead guilty to non-capital murder, which would result in life imprisonment for Lamb but allow a parole hearing after 10 years. In any case, Nosanchuk could not use the case he had prepared unless he first received unequivocal written instruction from his client to plead <b>insanity.</b> Having been given a week by his counsel to consider the matter, Lamb wrote to Nosanchuk that he wished to attempt a mental disorder defence. The boy made clear his understanding that if he were found not guilty under these terms, the state still had the right to detain him {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
5|$|In {{the centre}} of the {{foreground}} is a figure modelled on Caius Gabriel Cibber's Raving Madness, which at the time was one of two monumental sculptures above the entrance to Bethlem Hospital ("Bedlam"), and a well-known London landmark and symbol of <b>insanity.</b> The chained figure is contorted in agony struggling to escape his bonds, while a daemon pulls {{on one end of the}} chain. Beside this lunatic is an unconscious or dead gambler, his winnings spread on the floor beside him.|$|E

50|$|Like most of Arreolas stories, The Switchman can be {{interpreted}} {{in a variety of}} ways—as a allegory of the pitfalls of the Mexican train system, an existential horror story of lifes absurdities and human limitation, and the authors desire to laugh in spite of the <b>insanities</b> of the world and human interaction.|$|R

Jackson opted to cast Combs as Dammers because he was a fan of the actor's work in Re-Animator.|$|E
5|$|Justice Stark then {{reviewed}} {{the evidence and}} advised the jury that in his opinion the weight of psychiatric evidence favoured the defence; however, he reminded them, {{it was up to}} them to decide. The jury retired at 16:30 on 20 January 1967 to make their decision, and returned to the courtroom shortly before 19:00 to give their verdict. They found Lamb to be {{not guilty by reason of}} <b>insanity.</b> Lamb showed no reaction when the verdict was read.|$|E

Kemper twice tried to commit suicide in custody, surviving both times. His trial went ahead on October 23, 1973.|$|E
