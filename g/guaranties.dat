25|$|Andreas Schmid, CEO of VIP Medienfonds ('Medienfonds' is a German {{term for}} a type of closed {{investment}} fund) {{and one of the}} film's executive producers, was arrested in October 2005 on suspicion of fraud and tax evasion. The resulting investigation revealed some irregularities in the financing of Perfume, suggesting that some investors may have invested in the film as a vehicle for tax evasion (to acquire tax losses). According to documents Schmid filed to tax authorities, VIP invested €25 million into the film. But according to Constantin Film's ledgers, VIP only put up €4.1 million. The remainder of the €25 million was banked to collect interest, secure bank <b>guaranties</b> and used to pay back investors their share of the film's revenue. As VIP claimed the whole €25 million was used to produce the film, its investors were also able to write off their entire contribution against tax. Perfume also received €700,000 in state subsidies from Filmstiftung NRW based on the €4.1 million figure. In November 2007, Schmid was found guilty of multiple counts of tax evasion and sentenced to six years in prison. He had already served more than two years in jail since his arrest.|$|E

This treaty offered <b>guaranties</b> (especially extraterritoriality) that would become the model for future [...] "unequal treaties" [...] between European and Asian powers. By this agreement, French law courts, churches and valuables would all remain extraterritorial in the Ottoman Empire.

In contrast to a CDI contract, CNE employees are at a disadvantage in obtaining credit or housing. This claim, however, has been denied by banks. After the February 20, 2006 judgment (see below), the CGT trade union declared that [...] "the magistrate has put in evidence the embezzlement of the CNE and the abusive character of the rupture": [...] "it is the principle itself of the CNE which allows such illegitimate use: by suppressing the <b>guaranties</b> which protect against abusive firing, the CNE favorize all arbitrary bosses' behavior".|$|E
