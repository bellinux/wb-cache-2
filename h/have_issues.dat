5|$|The AWS has {{a mind of}} its own {{at times}} and reaches peak {{performance}} with the owner who is dedicated to teaching the dog just what is expected of it. The breed takes well to training, and especially excels at training that offers some variety rather than routine training drills. However, members of the breed can may <b>have</b> <b>issues</b> with food possessiveness. They can be stubborn, and mentally are slow to mature from puppyhood. Some lines of the breed still retain dominant and aggressive temperaments; other than these lines, the AWS gets on well with children and enjoys playing with them. Even though they were originally bred to hunt, due to their size, they are suitable for apartment living as long as they receive enough exercise.|$|E

25|$|Swales can be {{incorporated}} in urban designs along streets or parklands {{and add to the}} aesthetic character of an area. Typical swales are created with longitudinal slopes between 1% and 4% in order to maintain flow capacity without creating high velocities, potential erosion of the bioretention or swale surface and safety hazard. In steeper areas check banks along swales or dense vegetation can help to distribute ﬂows evenly across swales and slow velocities. Milder-sloped swales may <b>have</b> <b>issues</b> with water-logging and stagnant ponding, in which case underdrains can be employed to alleviate problems. If the swale is to be vegetated, vegetation must be capable of withstanding design ﬂows and be of sufficient density to provide good ﬁltration). Ideally, vegetation height should be above treatment ﬂow water levels. If runoff enters directly into a swale, perpendicular to the main ﬂow direction, the edge of the swale acts as a buffer and provides pre-treatment for the water entering the swale.|$|E

While positively contrasting the show with other teen-age dramas like One Tree Hill, Goldblatt also had doubts about its staying power. Varietys Brian Lowry called the show [...] "Earnest, beautifully shot and perhaps more organically religious {{than anything else in}} primetime". Still, he felt the show was [...] "like one of those family programs middle America and conservatives pine for that too few of them actually bother to watch". He pointed out that the show had to compete with both House and Dancing With the Stars, among women as well as men, in order to survive. The Washington Post critic Tom Shales called the show [...] "Extraordinary in just about every conceivable way," [...] particularly emphasising the quality of the cast. Shales did <b>have</b> <b>issues</b> with the documentary style of show's camera movements, but still thought it could be the [...] "best new drama series of the season".|$|E
