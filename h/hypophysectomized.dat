50|$|Rosenblatt's 1967 {{study of}} the {{induction}} of maternal behavior is consider by many in his field to be his most famous study. In that study he showed that the neural basis of parental care is independent of pregnancy and birth. He found that he could induce maternal behavior in virgin female rats during a 6 to 8 day period by continuously exposing them to rat pups. He also found that female rats that were ovariectomized or <b>hypophysectomized</b> could also be induced to exhibit maternal behavior via the continuous exposure to rat pups. Although the hormonal and physiological processes that occur during pregnancy and birth enhance maternal behavior, maternal behavior has an already developed neural basis in the brain.|$|E
50|$|Moudgal's early {{researches}} at the University of Madras {{were on the}} biochemistry of thyroid hormones but {{he shifted}} his focus to pituitary gonadotropins during his days at Choh Hao Li's laboratory at the University of California, Berkeley when he established that the hormones generated immune response in living beings and the discovery {{was reported to be}} a significant one as the belief till then was the principal function of the hormones was reproduction. Later, at Rodney Porter's laboratory in London, he worked on cellulose as a carrier for immobilization of antibodies. Back in India, he expanded the scope of his researches to cover wider aspects of reproductive biology for which he established a Primate Research Laboratory at IISc in 1965, which was the largest primate house in the country at that time. Working on the macaques in his primate house, he discovered that sialidase from the kidney of the primate acted as an inhibitor of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), a hormone responsible for pubertal development. He conducted elaborate studies on the molecular mechanism of Luteinizing Hormone (LH), a hormone which has significant role in ovulation and testosterone production, and elucidated the unfolding of LH binding to LH receptors in the target cell which was detailed in one of his articles, Effect of ICSH on Early Pregnancy in <b>Hypophysectomized</b> Pregnant Rats, published in Nature in 1969. He discovered that neutralizing LH resulted in neutralization of several reproductive functions such as ovulation, implantation, and gestational progress and the discovery opened a new methodology in immunocontraceptive technology. Later, he furthered his investigations on hormone actions by using antibodies as probes. His findings reportedly prompted R. O. Greep of Harvard University to invite him for collaborative research and Moudgal supervised the work of Greep's Group at his laboratory. At Harvard, he also collaborated with W. R. Moyle and established the presence of Luteinizing hormone/choriogonadotropin receptors on tumor cells in the testicles for the first time, which they revealed in an article, Specific binding of luteinizing hormone to Leydig tumor cells, published in the Journal of Biological Chemistry in 1971. He used these tumor cells for further investigations on Hormone-Receptor interactions, Cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cyclic AMP) production and steroidogenesis and experimentally demonstrated the extent of coupling and response with regard to cyclic AMP production and steroid output.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Hypophysectomized</b> turkey hens do not {{exhibit the}} {{excessive}} early mortality characteristic of <b>hypophysectomized</b> chickens. Postoperative survival in an uncontrolled environ-ment {{is good enough}} to make the <b>hypophysectomized</b> turkey a reliable tool for a variety of endocrine studies. POULTRY SCIENCE 52 : 2345 - 2347, 1973 INVESTIGATIONS involving replacement therapy in <b>hypophysectomized</b> hens are needed to establish specific hormonal re-quirements for broodiness in poultry. Chick-ens are not suitable for such work because of excessive early postoperative mortality (Hill etal, 1934; Rothchild, 1948; Opel, 1969). No data are available on mortality rates in <b>hypophysectomized</b> turkeys. The present study was initiated to assess survival in <b>hypophysectomized</b> turkey hens. Operated hens were maintained initially in a controlled environment known to promote survival in <b>hypophysectomized</b> chickens (Nalbandov et al., 1951) and then transferred to a floor pen environment useful for studies of broodiness. Chickens were included to demonstrate overtly the dramatic difference in viability of <b>hypophysectomized</b> hens of the two species...|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{whereby the}} pituitary gland maintains arterial pressure were investigated in rats. The arterial pressure in <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats was 30 mmHg below normal. Saralasin or captopril caused a further fall of 25 and 30 mmHg, respectively, {{suggesting that the}} renin-angiotensin system {{plays a role in}} blood pressure maintenance in <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats. Growth hormone administration to <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats increased the arterial pressure, but pretreatment with captopril prevented the effect. Plasma renin activity and basal renin secretion (in vitro) was normal in <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats despite a twofold greater renal renin content. Secretory responsiveness to isoproterenol and calcium omission was lower in <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats.

40|$|Effects of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) on plasma {{levels of}} sex hormones were studied in intact, <b>hypophysectomized,</b> and <b>hypophysectomized</b> plus gonadectomized {{males and females}} of Rana esculenta.

40|$|The {{interactions}} of insulin, growth hormone (somatotropin) and tri-iodothyronine (T 3) {{in the long-term}} (24 h) regulation of fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism were studied in hepatocyte primary cultures isolated from normal or <b>hypophysectomized</b> Sprague-Dawley rats. Hepatocytes from <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats had similar rates of palmitate metabolism, but lower rates of ketogenesis, than hepatocytes from normal rats. They also had a lower endogenous triacylglycerol content and lower activities of NADP-linked dehydrogenases than did cells from normal rats. The inhibitions of ketogenesis and gluconeogenesis by insulin were more marked in hepatocytes from <b>hypophysectomized</b> than from normal rats. Insulin caused a 7 - 10 -fold increase in cellular glycogen in hepatocytes from <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats, compared with a 2 - 3 -fold increase in cells from normal rats, and it increased cellular triacylglycerol by 65 % in cells from <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats, compared with 11 % in cells from normal rats. In hepatocytes from <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats, growth hormone and T 3 increased ketogenesis both separately and in combination (12 % and 23 % respectively; P less than 0. 05), whereas in hepatocytes from normal rats only the combination of growth hormone and T 3 caused {{a significant increase in}} ketogenesis. In cells from <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats, T 3 and growth hormone had different effects on carbohydrate metabolism: T 3, but not growth hormone, potentiated the anti-gluconeogenic and glycogenic effects of insulin. It is concluded that hypophysectomy increases the responsiveness of hepatocytes to insulin, growth hormone and T 3, and that growth hormone and T 3 regulate fatty acid and carbohydrate metabolism by different mechanisms...|$|E

Testicular GGT was higher in adult <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats treated with FSH {{from the time of}} surgery than in untreated <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats; testosterone propionate treatment had no effect. GGT activity in Sertoli cells isolated from GnRH antagonist-treated or <b>hypophysectomized</b> immature rats was also lower than in cells from control rats.

40|$|Plasma glucose, immunoreactive {{glucagon}} (IRG), and insulin {{were measured}} in <b>hypophysectomized</b> dogs receiving cortisol and thyroid replacement therapy. 4 wk after hypophysectomy mean fasting plasma glucose levels had declined from 90 ± 2 mg/ 100 ml to 64 ± 2; fasting and arginine-stimulated insulin and IRG levels were, respectively, ∼ 50 % lower and unchanged. 12 wk or more after hypophysectomy, despite lower plasma glucose levels, fasting and arginine-stimulated IRG levels were significantly below control dogs. <b>Hypophysectomized</b> and shamhypophysectomized dogs {{were subjected to}} total pancreatectomy. Postoperatively, in the sham-hypophysectomized, depancreatized dogs fasting glucose levels ranged from 300 - 500 mg/ 100 ml on 8 - 10 U/day of insulin; IRG levels averaged 215 ± 29 pg/ml. The <b>hypophysectomized,</b> depancreatized dogs required 0 - 4 U/day and fasting glucose levels under 100 mg/ 100 ml were not uncommon, even without insulin; fasting IRG levels averaged 63 ± 4 pg/ml (P < 0. 001). During arginine infusion in sham-hypophysectomized, depancreatized dogs, IRG levels rose from 215 ± 60 pg/ml to a peak of 404 ± 112 pg/ml; in <b>hypophysectomized,</b> depancreatized dogs, the base line IRG averaged 44 ± 8 and the peak 110 ± 25 pg/ml (P < 0. 05). IRG levels in the venous effluent of the gastric fundus, {{the major source of}} nonpancreatic glucagon, reached a peak of 4, 898 ± 959 pg/ml in the sham-hypophysectomized, depancreatized group during arginine infusion and only 219 ± 128 pg/ml in the <b>hypophysectomized,</b> depancreatized group. In three <b>hypophysectomized,</b> depancreatized dogs, a replacement infusion with glucagon for 10 h promptly increased hyperglycemia by 80 - 180 mg/ 100 ml and worsened glycosuria, evidence of a hepatic response to glucagon replacement. It is concluded that hypophysectomy somehow decreased both the hypersecretion of gastric IRG and the severe hyperglycemia that otherwise follows pancreatectomy. The <b>hypophysectomized,</b> depancreatized animal, therefore, has combined insulin and glucagon deficiency, and the latter may contribute to reduced severity of its hyperglycemia...|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} growth hormone (GH) and/or {{cortisone}} and thyroxine (T 4) treatment on the ultrastructure of the transplantable Swarm rat chondrosarcoma grown in <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats were studied. Marked atrophy {{of the tumor}} occurred when it was grown in <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats. Maximal restoration of tumor growth in <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats was achieved when cortisone, T 4, and GH were administered in combination.

A sexual dimorphism in the levels of several of these isoenzymes and in their responses to hypophysectomy was demonstrated. In the liver of sham-operated females and males {{there are differences in}} glutathione transferase activities and isoenzyme pattern.

40|$|Earlier {{experiments}} 1 {{showed that}} the low blood pressure of <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats was due to a decreased cardiac output, while pe-ripheral resistance was slightly above normal. This was also the case in <b>hypophysectomized</b> man. 2 Acute loading by infusion of polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, PVP, into {{the right side of}} the heart resulted in an increase of cardiac out-put and work to 2 - 4 times the basal, pre-infusion values. Tt was concluded that the hypotension and low cardiac output in hypo-physectomized rats was not due to the inabili-ty of the heart to raise its output but rather to the fact that some hemodynamic prerequisite of a higher output was absent. The atrophy of the heart which is known to take place after hypopliysectomy 3 ' 4 (the loss of cardiac weight is proportionately greater than the loss of body weight) was considered to be due to an adaptation of the heart to the lower demands.

40|$|Summary. Successful {{induction}} of decidualization on the 4 th day of pseudopregnancy (L 4) {{is possible}} in rats <b>hypophysectomized</b> on L 3 of pseudopregnancy (after 19. 00 hours).

The effect of hypophysectomy on decidualiza-tion which is already established depends upon the time of removal of the pituitary. When hypophysectomy was performed before the 11 th day ofpseudopregnancy (L 11) breakdown and resorption of the deciduomata occurred within 4 days; when hypophysectomy was carried out on L 11 or L 12, the deciduomata were resorbed more slowly. This relatively prolonged resorption was related to the absence ofovulation {{at the end of the}} period of pseudopregnancy in the <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats.

40|$|Immunoreactive PRL {{which is}} not of {{pituitary}} origin, has been identified in many regions of the rat brain. We have previously demonstrated that estradiol increases hypothalamic immunoreactive PRL content in <b>hypophysectomized</b> female rats. To determine if estradiol stimulates PRL synthesis, we examined the effect of estradiol on the in vivo production of PRL, and on the expression of PRL messenger RNA (mRNA) in the hypothalamus, pons, and cerebral cortex. To {{examine the effect of}} estradiol on the in vivo production of PRL, [35 S] methionine was injected into the lateral ventricle and its incorporation into immunoprecipitable PRL was determined by immunoprecipitation and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. In estradiol, but not vehicle-treated <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats, a 24, 000 M(r) immunoprecipitable PRL protein was detected in the hypothalamus and pons-medulla, 2 and 4 h after methionine administration. No immunoprecipitable PRL proteins were detected in the amygdala, hippocampus, cortex, or serum at either time point. In addition, in the hypothalamus, but not the pons-medulla, a second PRL band was detected with an apparent mol wt of 16, 000 K. To determine if estradiol increased the expression of PRL mRNA, copy DNA was obtained by reverse transcription of poly(A+) mRNA prepared from intact and vehicle or estradiol-treated <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats and analyzed by polymerase chain reaction amplification.

40|$|The {{effects of}} pure FSH and/or LH {{preparations}} {{on the number}} of Leydig cells and their function in immature <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats have been investigated. As a result of hypophysectomy at the age of 17 - 18 days, the number of recognizable Leydig cells per testis decreased, as did the steroidogenic capacity in vivo and in vitro. Treatment with 64 micrograms FSH on both 22 and 23 days of age, did not affect the number of recognizable Leydig cells. In contrast, two injections of LH (10 micrograms) caused a sixfold {{increase in the number of}} Leydig cells, but had a negative effect on spermatogenesis. These stimulatory and inhibitory effects of LH diminished when FSH was added. Treatment with FSH for 7 days caused a twofold increase in the number of Leydig cells when compared with <b>hypophysectomized</b> controls. 3 beta-Hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD) and esterase activity in Leydig cells also increased under the influence of FSH. The pregnenolone production per Leydig cell in the presence of 5 -cholesten- 3 beta, 22 (R) -diol (22 R-hydroxycholesterol) as substrate showed a sevenfold increase. Plasma testosterone levels 2 h after injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin in intact rats and <b>hypophysectomized</b> FSH-treated rats were the same. Following LH treatment for 7 days, the number of Leydig cells proved to be 11 times higher, and 3 beta-HSD and esterase activity were not different from intact controls. The testicular pregnenolone production was four- to fivefold higher when compared with untreated <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats. However, pregnenolone production per Leydig cell in LH-treated rats was only slightly different from the <b>hypophysectomized</b> controls. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|E
40|$|In {{an earlier}} study (Ahmad, Haltmeyer & Eik-Nes, 1973), we {{reported}} main-tenance of spermatogenesis in tubules of <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats adjoining intratesticular implants of silastic capsules containing testosterone or di-hydrotestosterone (DHT). It was suggested that the local differences in the testes of the rats receiving the two treatments might {{be attributed to the}} relative amounts of hormone escaping from the silastic capsules. It was calculated that only 8 =. =m/day escaped from the capsule {{over the course of the}} experiment compared to 12 =. =m/day. In order to compare the maintenance of spermatogenesis in DHT- and testosterone-treated rats with that in normal controls, experiments were undertaken in which larger quantities of hormones than those in the previous study were administered to <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats. Twenty-eight male Long=m- were <b>hypophysectomized</b> at 90 days of age by the parapharyngeal approach and were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Treatment was initiated immediately after hypophysectom...|$|E
40|$|The {{administration}} of morphine to <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats potentiated the steroidogenic {{response of the}} adrenal cortex to exogenous adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) in a dose-dependent fashion. Conversely, the opiate antagonist naloxone inhibited the adrenal response to ACTH. Naloxone pretreatment also antagonized the potentiating effect of morphine on ACTH-induced steroidogenesis in a dose-dependent manner. Neither morphine nor naloxone, administered to <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats, had any direct effect on adrenal steroidogenesis. These adrenal actions were stereospecific since neither the (+) -stereoisomer of morphine, nor that or naloxone, had any effect on the adrenal response to ACTH. The {{administration of}} human beta-endorphin to <b>hypophysectomized</b> rats {{had no effect on}} the adrenal corticosterone concentration nor did it alter the response of the adrenal gland to ACTH. These results indicate that morphine can potentiate the action of ACTH on the adrenal by a direct, stereospecific, dose-dependent mechanism that is prevented by naloxone pretreatment and which may involve competition for ACTH receptors on the corticosterone-secreting cells of the adrenal cortex...|$|E
40|$|Summary. An {{explanation}} is {{proposed for the}} fact that luteinizing hormone (lh) injected into intact pseudopregnant rabbits acts in a luteolytic manner while in <b>hypophysectomized</b> rabbits it acts like a luteotrophin. Recent evidence shows that oestrogen is both luteotrophic and steroidogenic in rabbits. It is pointed out that injection of lh into intact rabbits causes ovulation of follicles which presumably serve as the endogenous source of oestrogen. In the absence of endogenous oestrogen, corpora lutea degenerate. In <b>hypophysectomized</b> rabbits, follicles do not ovulate in response to lh, and the latter is assumed to cause the unovulated follicles to secrete oestrogen which in turn acts in a luteotrophic manner on the corpora lutea. It has been noted by Stormshak & Casida (1964) that the injection of a single dose of lh (50 ^g) into rabbits causes the regression of corpora lutea (cl) of pseudopregnancy. At the same time lh {{has been found to be}} luteotrophic in <b>hypophysectomized</b> rabbits (Kilpatrick, Armstrong & Greep, 1964). It ha...|$|E
40|$|Acetylcholine {{produced}} a fall of blood eosinophils and adrenal ascorbic acid in normal rats; these effects {{did not occur}} in <b>hypophysectomized</b> animals or in <b>hypophysectomized</b> animals bearing a pituitary homotransplant in the anterior chamber of the eye. Acetylcholine had a striking and long-lasting antidiuretic effect in normal rats, which was abolished by hypophysectomy. In normal dogs, intravenous injections of acetylcholine raised the concentration of posterior pituitary antidiuretic hormone in the cerebrospinal fluid. These results are discussed in connexion with the hypothesis that posterior pituitary antidiuretic hormone may be the neurohumoral substance involved in the hypothalamic control of the anterior pituitary...|$|E
