Wrigley Company officials, {{including}} William Wrigley, Jr. II, wanted to contribute to Millennium Park, and the historic aspect of the peristyle was attractive to them partly because the original peristyle was constructed {{around the same time}} as the Wrigley Building, the corporate headquarters located a few blocks to the north, and because the classical architectural styles of both are similar.|$|E
5|$|Although {{important}} discoveries {{continued to}} elude Lawrence's Radiation Laboratory, mainly {{due to its}} focus {{on the development of}} the cyclotron rather than its scientific use, through his increasingly larger machines, Lawrence was able to provide crucial equipment needed for experiments in high energy physics. Around this device, he built what became the world's foremost laboratory for the new field of nuclear physics research in the 1930s. He received a patent for the cyclotron in 1934, which he assigned to the Research Corporation, a private <b>foundation</b> <b>that</b> funded much of Lawrence's early work.|$|E
5|$|Between 1932 and 1933, Burnet took {{leave of}} absence to {{undertake}} a fellowship at the National Institute for Medical Research in London. The Great Depression had resulted in Burnet's salary being cut from 1000 to 750 pounds, and the National Institute {{had been given a}} large grant from the Rockefeller <b>Foundation</b> <b>that</b> allowed them to hire Burnet at 1000 pounds per annum. The National Institute's Director Sir Henry Dale gained permission from Kellaway for the two-year move; Kellaway promised to hold Burnet's job for him when he returned and felt that the experience would make Burnet—whom he saw as the Hall Institute's brightest young scientist—better equipped to expand operations when he returned to Melbourne. Dale also paid for Burnet's sister to travel to England to help look after her brother's young children.|$|E

5|$|In 1990, {{the school}} {{received}} a donation of around 250 pieces of ancient, European, Middle Eastern, and Asian {{art from the}} Sponenburgh family. Alumnus Dan Schneider suggested to an art faculty member, Roger Hull, that the school should have a museum to display the university’s art collection in 1992. Then in 1994 Roger Hull made a presentation to the school’s trustees to push {{for the creation of}} an art museum. Over the next two years plans were developed and donations were made that led to the purchase of a building near campus for a museum. One large donation came from Hallie Ford and the Ford Family <b>Foundation</b> <b>that</b> allowed the purchase and remodel to move forward. The museum officially opened in 1998 with over 3,000 pieces of art, and was the second largest art museum in the state at that time.|$|E
5|$|In late 1518, {{the post}} of the Leutpriestertum (people's priest) of the Grossmünster at Zurich became vacant. The canons of the <b>foundation</b> <b>that</b> {{administered}} the Grossmünster recognised Zwingli's reputation as a fine preacher and writer. His connection with humanists was a decisive factor as several canons were sympathetic to Erasmian reform. In addition, {{his opposition to the}} French and to mercenary service was welcomed by Zurich politicians. On 11 December 1518, the canons elected Zwingli to become the stipendiary priest and on 27 December he moved permanently to Zurich.|$|E

5|$|Infant {{mortality}} rates are high, and life expectancy at birth is 50.03years. Abortion is illegal in Malawi. The Penal Code punishes women who seek illegal or clinical abortion with 14 years and 7 years in prison. There {{is a high}} adult prevalence rate of HIV/AIDS, with an estimated 980,000adults (or 9.1% of the population) living with the disease in 2015. There are approximately 27,000deaths each year from HIV/AIDS, and over half a million children orphaned because of the disease (2015). Approximately 250new people are infected each day, and at least 70% of Malawi's hospital beds are occupied by HIV/AIDS patients. The high rate of infection has resulted in an estimated 5.8% of the farm labor force dying of the disease. The government spends over $120,000 each year on funerals for civil servants who die of the disease. In 2006, international superstar Madonna started Raising Malawi, a <b>foundation</b> <b>that</b> helps AIDS orphans in Malawi, and also financed a documentary about the hardships experienced by Malawian orphans, called I Am Because We Are.
