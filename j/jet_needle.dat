40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the control strategy proposed {{for a new}} wave energy converter (WEC) design, the MGR. The control aims to maximise the energy absorption from waves, adapting converter's resistance to the incoming wave size. The MGR is a near shore submerged converter that {{takes advantage of the}} oscillating water column created by the wave when it passes on the converter's platform. The wave column moves the platform, transmitting the force to a single acting cylinder, that pumps sea water to the coast, where is turbined generating electricity. The control strategy is based on adjusting the system pressure to the coming wave size to create the optimal resistance, absorbing the maximum energy from it. The pressure is controlled by the aperture of turbine jet, positioning <b>jet</b> <b>needle.</b> In addition, the PLC implements the synchronous generator's load (torque) {{in order to maintain the}} turbine working at the maximum efficiency rotation speed.

50|$|Facilities in the bathhouses {{included}} licensing for {{the number}} of tubs along with spraying facilities such as water <b>jets</b> and <b>needle</b> showers. A doctor's prescription was required for some medical services which were provided. Although baths could be taken without the advice of a physician this practice was not recommended. It was advised that baths only be taken for diseases which they could improve along with the proper drugs for the condition. Services included mercury rubs (used since the 16th century for treating syphilis), enemas and massages. The first whirlpool bath was installed in 1937. Mercury treatments began to be replaced by the drug Salvarsan after its invention in 1908 and the clinic above the Government Free Bathhouse began furnishing Salvarsan treatments in 1920. These were finally rendered obsolete by the discovery of penicillin and its widespread manufacture after World War II allowed syphilis to be effectively and reliably cured.|$|R

40|$|In the {{colorectal}} tumor, the lesions {{suitable for}} the endoscopic treatment are those with no lymph node metastasis such as adenomas, intramucosal cancers, and minimally invasive submucosal cancer (invasion depth 1000 m, well and moderately differentiated type, no lymphovascular invasion). The new endoscopic technique, endoscopic submucosal dissection (ESD) enables en-bloc resection of the lesions regardless of their size and location. In order to perform ESD more easily, safely, and efficiently, we invented water <b>jet</b> short <b>needle</b> knives (Flush knife). Emitting a jet {{of water from the}} tip of a sheath enables submucosal local injection with a knife itself without replacement of operative instruments, which leads to efficient treatment. Especially, Flush knife is very effective for the lesions located at lower rectum and anal canal where there are many vessels. We treated a total of 361 colorectal lesions by ESD between June 2002 and July 2007, and en-block complete resection rate was 98. 3 %. In 12 cases, "muscle retracting sign" was recognized. This sign is an index of the discontinuation of ESD, but it is impossible to diagnose preoperatively. The postoperative bleeding occurred in 0. 8 % (3 cases: no blood transfusion is needed). The intraoperative perforation occurred in 1. 9 % (6 cases: 5 cases were treated conservatively, 1 case was treated surgically) and the postoperative perforation occurred in 1 case (0. 3 %) treated surgically. ESD is the extremely effective treatment for the colorectal tumors and also is possible to be performed safely with the appropriate choice of the devices and strategy for dissection...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Initial jet {{usually has}} a large primary droplet hanging at flying end {{before the onset of}} {{effective}} electrospinning. The primary droplet is undesired as its diameter is several orders of magnitude higher than that of electrospun nanofibres. A new method is used to derive micro-scaled initial jet and fine primary droplet under applied small-aperture needle by utilizing low solution flow rate and pre-applied electric potential before the extrusion of polymeric solution out of the needle. Small-aperture needle reduces the base of conical pendant, while low solution flow rate prevents a fluidic inrush into conical pendant. The pre-applied electric potential preforms a miniature liquid cone, as an origin of initial <b>jet,</b> within the <b>needle.</b> The conic preformation reduces the formation time of Taylor cone in order to escape from a swollen Taylor cone under a continuous inflow of polymeric solution. The miniature conical pendant grows so acute that it emits fine primary droplet rapidly from its tip with accumulated ions.

40|$|Background: {{the aim of}} {{this study}} was to examine the effects of {{controlled}} hemorrhage and shock on oxygenation and ventilation using <b>needle</b> cricothyroidotomy and <b>jet</b> ventilation in an animal model. Methods: Twenty-four male pigs were randomly allocated into 4 groups: SHOCK (animals in hemorrhagic shock only), CRICH (animals that underwent needle cricothyroidotomy only), SHOCK+ CRICH (animals in hemorrhagic shock + needle cricothyroidotomy), and SHAM (anesthetized animals submitted to surgical preparation only). All animals were surgically prepared and were observed for a period of 40 minutes (T 0 - T 40). Hemodynamic and blood gas variables were compared using analysis of variance and Bonferroni post hoc testing at a level of significance of 95 %. Results: CRICH and SHOCK+ CRICH developed respiratory acidosis, with a progressive decrease of arterial pH after T 20, and they presented a significant increase of PaCO 2 levels after T 10, when compared with SHAM and SHOCK (P <. 001). When SHOCK+ CRICH was compared with CRICH, it presented a larger increase of PaCO 2 after T 10 (P =. 036) and an even more significant increase after T 20 (P =. 009). Conclusion: Hemorrhagic shock anticipated and intensified the retention of carbon dioxide and respiratory acidosis during manual <b>jet</b> ventilation through <b>needle</b> cricothyroidotomy in comparison with animals with jet ventilation but without shock. the results found in this work should be considered in future protocols for the assistance of victims of trauma in prehospital settings.

40|$|The need to {{maintain}} long term vascular access patency is critical for patients with kidney failure. Vascular access allows artificial blood filtration through haemodialysis and failure of the access can be life threatening. The mechanisms for failure are not understood and dialysis needles may be a key contributor. Haemodynamic parameters {{play an important role}} in vascular health and have been linked to the development of intimal hyperplasia, a pathological growth of the blood vessel initiated by injury. The primary objective of this thesis is to examine the haemodynamic forces produced by dialysis needles and to determine methods of identifying and minimising the risk of vascular access failure. Computational fluid dynamic models have been utilised to examine the haemodynamics produced by the needles, in particular the high shear stresses on the vein wall and the oscillatory shear with high particle residency times. These computational simulations were validated using stereoscopic particle image velocimetry measurements on a flow rig. The flow field produced by the arterial needle remained localised around the needle tip indicating that the two needles can be placed in close proximity to each other without increasing the risk of access recirculation. Conversely, the flow field produced by the venous needle was more dynamic due to the presence of the <b>jet.</b> Both <b>needles</b> produced disturbed flows with high residency times which may lead to endothelial dysfunction, whilst the venous needle also produced high shear stresses at the point of jet impingement, which may damage the endothelial layer. Shallow needle angles with optimal placement away from the walls of the vein and the use of blood flow rates around 300 ml/min may minimise potential endothelial damage. Needle rotation, a technique usually performed to alleviate pressure in the arterial line, was shown to have no haemodynamic benefit and can increase the risk of infiltration. A plastic cannula for haemodialysis offers a viable alternative to the current metal needles. Its symmetric geometry with four staggered side holes also negates the requirement of rotation. Pressures were also examined to determine the potential of microbubble formation due to cavitation. Elevated blood flow rates (> 600 ml/min) and sharp changes in geometry were catalysts for cavitation at the arterial needle. Doppler ultrasound measurements revealed a high level of pulsatility within the extracorporeal circuit. This indicated that cavitation at the arterial needle is unlikely to occur under normal dialysis conditions, but may occur at the roller pump. Clinical measurements pertaining to each dialysis session were also analysed to determine the incidence of late fistula failure. Patient data confirmed that stenosis in the venous outflow segment is pertinent in late fistula failure. The risk of stenosis was higher in the first six months of fistula use, as the blood vessels adapt to frequent cannulation. This was reflected by the increase in vascular resistance over the life of the access. The patient data supports the computational results, which indicates that stenosis in the outflow vein may be caused by the haemodynamics produced by dialysis needles...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to test the {{hypothesis}} that daily administration of growth hormone using the Medi-Jector® results in fewer adverse psychological responses than needle injection with a multidose injection pen. The Medi-Jector is a needle-free injection device that can deliver growth hormone subcutaneously through jet injection. The group studied consisted of 18 children aged 10 y or over who were participating in a study of the bioequivalence and bioequipotence of the administration of growth hormone through <b>jet</b> injection or <b>needle</b> injection. Previously, all subjects had received growth hormone therapy with commercially available multidose injection pens. The study was designed as a prospective, randomized, two-period cross-over trial. A questionnaire was used to assess psychological responses such as non-compliance, opinion on ease of preparation, affective responses to administration and local side-effects, as well as overall preference. In addition, the subjects kept a diary during the study. The subjects found the Medi-Jector less offputting (p < 0. 01), less painful with respect to both frequency (p < 0. 04) and intensity (p < 0. 01) and less unpleasant (p < 0. 05) than a multidose injection pen with a 28 G needle (p < 0. 01). No difference in compliance was detected. Most subjects preferred the Medi-Jector for future use (p < 0. 05). The mean score on a 1 - 10 point scale (10 is excellent) was 7. 9 (SD 1. 4) for the Medi-Jector and 6. 8 (SD 2. 3) for the multidose injection pen (p < 0. 08). The prevalence of visible bruises each day was higher (p < 0. 01) with the Medi-Jector (2. 5, SD 2. 1) than with the multidose injection pen (0. 7, SD 1. 1), but children showed indifferent affective responses to bruising. Thirteen out of 18 subjects decided to continue therapy with the Medi-Jector (p < 0. 06). It is concluded that use of the Medi-Jector in growth hormone therapy tends to lead to fewer adverse psychological responses than a multidose injection pen with 28 G needles...|$|R
40|$|The goal of plasma induced {{healing is}} {{to obtain a}} high {{bacteria}} killing rate without significant damage of the healthy cells. For this task various cold atmospheric pressure plasma jets (APPJ’s) have been developed over the years. In those APPJ’s the plasma is created with an inert gas inside a ceramic or glass tube between two electrodes. The effluent mixes outside with the air-environment. APPJ’s differ usually in electrode geometry (ring, needle), used gas-effluent (helium, argon) and excitation frequency (DC, kHz, MHz). These differences in input parameters are also changing the plasma parameters, such as the gas temperature, UV-emission and production of reactive species, which makes a direct comparison of the plasma jets challenging and contributes to the large discrepancies between biomedical experiments of different groups using (slightly) different plasma jets 1. Additionally the plasma is also strongly influenced by the sample which is treated, due to the change in conductivity and capacitance which adds to the complexity. We investigate therefore also the plasmas in contact with saline solutions, which are representative for a wound. In this contribution we use one plasma <b>jet,</b> a plasma <b>needle</b> and operate it with helium and argon with mixtures of air and three different excitation modes, namely nanosecond pulsed DC, kHz pulsed radio-frequency and continuous radiofrequency. We investigate the difference of power dissipation of the plasma and spatial resolved gas temperature for the different conditions. Furthermore we investigate the dependence of these parameters when in contact with metal, ceramic and saline solution. For the pulse excited plasmas nanosecond time resolved images have been obtained to gain more insight on the morphology of those discharges when in contact with a saline solution. Preliminary results on cell and bacteria-treatment with the different plasmas are also discussed. 1. J.

40|$|Needle wells are {{conventional}} well-bores {{that contain}} several hundreds of laterals, called needle holes. The reservoir contact area is increased by these holes, which enables enhanced hydrocarbon production. The needle holes {{are created by}} dedicated pipes that are equipped with nozzles. These pipes are mounted in a special liner that is lowered downhole. By pumping fluid-abrasive particle mixtures through the nozzles, the formation is eroded away and causes the needle to propagate into the reservoir. The transport of fluid-particle mixtures in the narrow annulus of a needle geometry might result in challenges with regards to hole cleaning. Also, pressure losses for these mixtures are challenging to predict. The {{purpose of this study}} was to experimentally investigate the effects of flow rate variations, needle inclinations and needle eccentricity on pressures and hole cleaning in the annulus between a needle and the hole that it creates. From a literature study was determined that the combination of water with 4 vol. % steel particles might be a good mixture for the purpose of <b>needle</b> <b>jetting.</b> Due to strong acceleration of the mixture in the nozzles of the needle, the impact of the particles cause the formation to break and the water subsequently can enter the cracks to remove the rock cuttings. Typical pressures that have to be applied over the nozzles are in the order of 350 bar. The material properties for steel particles and water were used as input for a needle system design calculation. The needle diameter was set at 10 mm and from pressure loss calculations, and the aim to apply maximum pressure drop over the nozzle, the annulus outer diameter was defined to be 16 mm. Typical flow rates needed per needle are in the order of 30 L/min. Steel particle sizes for this system were calculated to be ~ 0. 2 mm. A program of experiments was defined wherein flow rates were varied between 10 - 30 L/min in steps of 10 L/min. Steel particle concentrations were set at 4 vol. % and particle sizes ranged from 0. 2 - 0. 3 mm. These experiments were run in a specially designed setup, wherein the annulus eccentricity and inclinations can be varied over their full range. Experiments were conducted for a concentric annulus in horizontal, vertical and 45 degree critical angle setting. For a fully eccentric annulus, the transport in horizontal and critical angle setting were investigated. In the vertical and critical angle experiments, the flow-direction was set against the force of gravity. Over a small length in the annulus, movies of the particle distributions were recorded by high speed camera. Stationary beds, moving beds and an asymmetric suspension of particles only occurred at 10 L/min & 20 L/min for horizontal eccentric setting and at 10 L/min for critical angle eccentric setting. The pressure losses for water-steel particle mixtures in concentric annuli were all higher than the losses for water flow. However, for increasing flow rates, this difference decreased. During water-steel particle experiments at 10 L/min in horizontal concentric setting, the annulus plugged. This resulted in rapid particle buildup in the annulus and should therefore be avoided. When flowing at 10 L/min in vertical concentric setting, the pressure losses were lower than for flowing at 10 L/min at horizontal and critical angle concentric settings. A pressure loss model for homogeneously suspended particles matched within 10 % accuracy with the results from vertical concentric setting. Furthermore, it was expected that at the critical angle, particle beds would slide back into the hole. This was not observed during the experiments.
