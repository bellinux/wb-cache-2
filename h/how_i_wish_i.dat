2500|$|Although Alan Gibson {{described}} Sutcliffe as [...] "a {{good public}} speaker", Sutcliffe himself {{seems to have}} been modest about this ability. During the war, he was asked to share a charity event platform with Sir Compton Mackenzie in Bradford. Mackenzie gave a brilliant speech that was well received and Sutcliffe said to him: [...] "Oh, my, <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could speak like you". Mackenzie, who was a keen cricket fan, replied: [...] "You don't wish nearly as much that you could speak like me as I wish I could bat like you".|$|E
60|$|THE PRINCESS. <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could! The most dreadful {{thing of}} all I {{have to go through}} myself.|$|E
60|$|THE STATUE. Your flow {{of words}} is simply amazing, Juan. <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could have talked {{like that to}} my soldiers.|$|E
5000|$|<b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> {{could have}} made a picture of the fine old man and his {{beautiful}} surroundings on that memorable day! ...|$|R
6000|$|The engine screamed. Did {{that mean}} {{she was running}} through? Oh, <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> had learned the {{interpretation}} of the signals! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{pretty little}} candles!" [...] said Rollo, talking half {{to himself and}} half to Carlos, [...] "and <b>how</b> tall! <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had some of them for Jennie." ...|$|R
6000|$|She paused, {{and then}} cried, with {{extraordinary}} vehemence: [...] "Oh, man, <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could keep it frae them for ever and ever!" ...|$|E
6000|$|TOUCHIT.--Darling child! <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> were married! If I {{had such}} a dear boy as you, George, {{do you know what}} I would give him? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I see." [...] The {{former teacher}} of Oak Hall gritted his teeth. [...] "Oh, <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could do {{something}} to punish Porter and those others!" ...|$|E
60|$|It was my {{wish to make}} my book a {{very large}} one; it was {{therefore}} desirable to be economical with the material I had left, and to eke it {{out as much as}} I could with fiction; but upon considering the matter I became convinced that it could not be very long before the material which in any way could be connected with the story must give out, and that therefore it would have to come to an end. <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> had spent more time in Sicily! I would have liked to write a whole book about Sicily.|$|R
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> that <b>I</b> {{might have}} {{accompanied}} them. It {{seemed to me}} that I could not fail to impress upon the intelligent red men of Barsoom the wicked deception that a cruel and senseless superstition had foisted upon them.|$|R
6000|$|... "Better and better. Why, I'm {{just around}} the corner on Wallace Street. I don't like my boardinghouse, though. It's bleak and lonesome, and my room looks out on such an unholy back yard. It's the ugliest place in the world. As for cats--well, surely ALL the Kingsport cats can't congregate there at night, but half of them must. I adore cats on hearth rugs, snoozing before nice, {{friendly}} fires, but cats in back yards at midnight are totally different animals. The first night I was here I cried all night, and so did the cats. You should have seen my nose in the morning. <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> had never left home!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The flower angel's aren't. They are a pale misty blue, {{just like}} the haze in the valley. Oh, <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could fly. It must be glorious." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It will {{suit you}} admirably--beautifully. You are {{tall enough to}} carry it off, {{and you have the}} figure also. <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> was equally certain about my own!' ...|$|E
60|$|LADY (wringing her hands). Oh, <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> {{really had}} told you some lie! You would have {{believed}} me then. The truth {{is the one thing}} that nobody will believe.|$|E
60|$|Mother, I {{think about}} you all more than ever--and poor Andrew, I often think about him. Mother, write to me how Nancy and the little boys are getting along. I got {{thinking}} last night about little California.[22] O <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> had her here for an hour to take care of--dear little girl. I don't think I ever saw a young one I took to so much--but I mustn't slight Hattie; I like her too. Mother, I am still going among the hospitals; {{there is plenty of}} need, just the same as ever. I go every day or evening. I have not heard from George--I have no doubt the 51st is still at Crab Orchard.|$|R
6000|$|When {{the early}} dawn {{began to break}} an idea {{brighter}} than the dawn broke upon me: I would {{get up and go}} nearer to her. It is amazing how much we lose by not getting up early on the long summer days. How beautiful the morning might be on this earth I never knew until I found myself wandering by the edge of my woods and over my lawn with the tender gray-blue sky above me and all the freshness of the grass and flowers and trees about me, the birds singing among the branches, and she sleeping sweetly somewhere within that house with its softly defined lights and shadows. <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> knew what room she occupied! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, <b>how</b> <b>I</b> do <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> {{understood}} you! <b>How</b> <b>I</b> do <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> {{knew what}} you were at! I have a great idea {{that you do not}} design to be cruel, when the right moment occurs. Till it does come, you know, we women never mean to have anybody. It is a thing of course among us, that every man is refused, till he offers. But why should you be cruel? Let me plead for my--present friend I cannot call him, but for my former friend. Where can you look for a more suitable match? Where could you expect a more gentlemanlike, agreeable man? Let me recommend Mr Elliot. I am sure you hear nothing but good of him from Colonel Wallis; and who can know him better than Colonel Wallis?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They have {{everything}} they want, while I have nothing," [...] {{he went on}} savagely. [...] "And they don't deserve it, either. Oh, <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could wring their necks for 'em!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Help me, Mr. Fotheringham,' she began; but Arthur, with a {{tremendous}} start, exclaimed, 'Hollo! if {{that is not a}} shame! <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had said what a shocking bad match it is!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, but {{bring your}} sister--that will be still better! I shall {{be delighted to}} know her. <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had been aware! Do tell her, please, that {{we had no idea}} of her presence.' ...|$|E
60|$|I can say {{honestly}} that I do {{not ever}} remember partaking {{of a more}} unhappy meal. Not only did I believe that I was looking on the last sun I should ever see--though by the way, there was uncommonly little of that orb visible--but what made the matter worse was that, if so, I should {{be called upon to}} die alone among savages, with not a single white face near to comfort me. Oh, <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> <b>I</b> had never allowed myself to be dragged into this dreadful business. Yes, and I was even mean enough to <b>wish</b> that <b>I</b> had broken my word to Panda and gone off with John Dunn when he invited me, although now I thank goodness that I did not yield to that temptation and thereby sacrifice my self-respect.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Darling quivered {{and went}} to the window. It was {{securely}} fastened. She looked out, and the night was peppered with stars. They were crowding round the house, as if curious to see what was to take place there, but she did not notice this, nor that {{one or two of the}} smaller ones winked at her. Yet a nameless fear clutched at her heart and made her cry, [...] "Oh, <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> that <b>I</b> wasn't going to a party to-night!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, Mac, that's {{just what}} I keep lecturing about, and people won't listen. You lads need {{that sort of}} {{knowledge}} so much, and fathers and mothers {{ought to be able}} to give it to you. Few of them are able, and so we all go blundering, as you say. Less Greek and Latin and more knowledge of the laws of health for my boys, if I had them. Mathematics are all very well, but morals are better, and <b>I</b> <b>wish,</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> that <b>I</b> could help teachers and parents to feel it as they ought." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I know mine are. Oh, <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could rid {{myself of}} them! But it cannot be done. Age will not blunt them,--I am sure of that," [...] said Mrs. Broughton. [...] "I wish it would." ...|$|E
6000|$|Later.--The {{letter was}} to express an earnest {{hope that my}} father had set out. My poor mother is sinking, they fear. What will become of Caroline? O, <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could see mother; why could not both have gone? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{know some}} one else that cares for you, my poor Sophy,' said Albinia, 'and {{who would do}} {{anything}} to make you feel it without distressing you. If you knew <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> knew what to do for you!' ...|$|E
60|$|Presently I saw the ten battleships {{that had}} been ordered to hold the shaft of Omean. They were {{returning}} at full speed, firing their stern batteries almost continuously. There could be but one explanation. They were being pursued by another hostile fleet. Well, the situation could be no worse. The expedition already was doomed. No man that had embarked upon it would return across that dreary ice cap. <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> that <b>I</b> might face Zat Arrras with my longsword for just an instant before I died! It was he who had caused our failure.|$|R
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>wished</b> that <b>I</b> had my revolvers and rifle! I {{would not}} have to worm my way like a scared cat toward Hooja's village, nor did I relish doing so now; but Dian's life might hinge upon the success of my venture, and so I could not afford to take chances. To have met {{suddenly}} with discovery and had a score or more of armed warriors upon me might have been very grand and heroic; but it would have immediately put an end to all my earthly activities, nor have accomplished aught in the service of Dian.|$|R
60|$|He {{heard the}} manor-house gates swing again, {{and looking up}} saw another person leaving them, and walking off in the {{direction}} of the parsonage. 'Ah, <b>how</b> much <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> were moving that way!' felt he parenthetically. The gentleman was tall, and resembled Mr. Swancourt in outline and attire. He opened the vicarage gate and went in. Mr. Swancourt, then, it certainly was. Instead of remaining in bed that morning Mr. Swancourt must have taken it into his head to see his new neighbour off on a journey. He must have been greatly interested in that neighbour to do such an unusual thing.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. How well Guy {{knew when}} he said it would be worse for him than for me! <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could do {{something}} now to make up for running away from him in Italy. If I was but at Redclyffe!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Anne Brinsmade!" [...] she cried. [...] "You {{may have}} your ball, and your Yankees, {{all of them}} you want. But I shan't come. <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> had never seen that horrid Stephen Brice! Then you would never have insulted me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So {{much the}} better. Anger and comfort cannot go together. Oh, one {{so good and}} gentle must be helped! <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> <b>I</b> could do {{anything}} for her; but she will be better at home. It is lucky there are no associations with him there.' ...|$|E
40|$|By the sea at Waikiki, Hawaii, Where {{you hear}} the ukuleles play, There I hear a melody, an old Hawaiian tune, And here’s what I keep singing by day: CHORUS My Hawaiian melody, your refrain keeps {{haunting}} me, I can’t help humming each strain the whole day long. From Waikiki you come drifting back to me, And I rejoice in your sweet song. <b>How</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> that <b>I</b> were there ‘neath Hawaiian moonlight fair, Where sweet guitars in harmony Would play each strain again for me, my Hawaiian melody. Some sweet day I’ll sail away to find you Where the ripp’ling waves caress the shore, In the land of sweetest dreams, where moonlight softly gleams, I’ll hear that sweetest melody once more...|$|R
6000|$|So this {{contract}} was settled. I have set {{it out at}} length because of its importance in our story. But now <b>I</b> wish--ah! <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>wish</b> that <b>I</b> had insisted upon being married to Marie then and there. If I had done so, I think I should have carried my point, for I was the [...] "master of many legions" [...] {{in the shape of}} cattle, food and ammunition, and rather than risk a quarrel with me, the other Boers would have forced Marais to give way. But we were young and inexperienced; also it was fated otherwise. Who can question the decrees of Fate written immutably, perhaps long before we were born, in the everlasting book of human destinies? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, <b>how</b> <b>I</b> have <b>wished</b> that <b>I</b> {{had taken}} your money! But never mind about that now, Harry. Wretched as such taunts were, they {{soon became a}} small thing. But it has been cowardly in your cousin, Hugh; has it not? If I had not lived with {{him as one of}} his family, it would not have mattered. People would not have {{expected}} it. It was as though my own brother had cast me forth." ...|$|R
