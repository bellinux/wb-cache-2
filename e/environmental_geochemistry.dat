50|$|The {{great power}} of XANES derives from its {{elemental}} specificity. Because the various elements have different core level energies, NEXAFS permits extraction {{of the signal}} from a surface monolayer or even a single buried layer {{in the presence of}} a huge background signal. Buried layers are very important in engineering applications, such as magnetic recording media buried beneath a surface lubricant or dopants below an electrode in an integrated circuit. Because XANES can also determine the chemical state of elements which are present in bulk in minute quantities, it has found widespread use in <b>environmental</b> chemistry and <b>geochemistry.</b> The ability of XANES to study buried atoms is due to its integration over all final states including inelastically scattered electrons, as opposed to photoemission and Auger spectroscopy, which study atoms only with a layer or two of the surface.|$|R

50|$|The rate of {{a number}} of geochemical changes taking place during the last decades in the {{biosphere}} has become catastrophically high. Such changes are often connected with human activities. To study these changes and to make better informed decisions on diminishing their adverse impact on living organisms, and especially on people, it is necessary to estimate the contemporary abundances of chemical elements in geochemical systems susceptible to the highest anthropogenic impact and having a significant effect on the development and existence of living organisms. One of such systems is the soil of urban landscapes. Settlements occupy less than 10% of the land area, but virtually the entire population of the planet lives within them. The main deposing medium in cities is soil, which ecological and geochemical conditions largely determine the life safety of citizens. So that, one of the priority tasks of the <b>environmental</b> <b>geochemistry</b> is to establish the average contents (abundances) of chemical elements in the soils of settlements.|$|E
5000|$|Much of {{the past}} {{research}} into the composition and toxicity of UCM hydrocarbons has been conducted by the Petroleum and <b>Environmental</b> <b>Geochemistry</b> Group (PEGG) at the University of Plymouth, UK. As well as the hydrocarbon UCM, oils also contain more polar compounds such as those containing oxygen, sulphur or nitrogen. These compounds can be very soluble in water and hence bioavailable to marine and aquatic organisms. Polar UCMs are present within produced waters from oil rigs and from oil sands processing. A polar UCM fraction extracted from North Sea oil produced water was reported to elicit hormonal disruption by way of both estrogen receptor agonist and androgen receptor agonist activity. Ongoing concern regarding the potential toxicity of components within Athabasca Oil Sands (Canada) tailings ponds has highlighted the need for identification of the compounds present. Until recently, such positive identification of individual so-called naphthenic acids from oil sands produced waters had so far eluded characterisation but recent research by PEGG presented at a SETAC conference in 2010 [...] revealed that, using a new GCxGC-TOF-MS, {{it was possible to}} resolve and identify a range of new compounds within such highly complex extracts. One group of compounds found to be present were tricyclic diamondoid acids. These structures had previously not even been considered as naphthenic acids and suggests an unprecedented degree of biodegradation of some of the oil in the oil sands.|$|E

40|$|Marls of the Metochia section (Gavdos, Greece) {{have been}} {{analyzed}} using <b>geochemistry,</b> <b>environmental</b> magnetism and diffuse reflectance spectrometry to study late Miocene paleoenvironmental {{changes in the}} Eastern Mediterranean region.

40|$|Concentrations {{and species}} of iodine {{isotopes}} (I- 127 and I- 129) provide vital information about iodine <b>geochemistry,</b> <b>environmental</b> conditions and water masses exchange in oceans. Despite extensive investigations of anthropogenic I- 129 in the Arctic Ocean and the Nordic Seas, concentrations of the isotope in the Atlantic Ocean are, however, still unknown. We here present first data on I- 129 and I- 127, and their species (iodide and iodate) in surface water transect along the northeastern Atlantic between 30 degrees and 50 degrees N. The results show iodate as the predominant {{species in the}} analyzed marine waters for both I- 127 and I- 129. Despite the rather constant ratios of I- 127 (-) /(IO 3 -) -I- 127, the I- 129 (-) /(IO 3 -) -I- 129 values reveal variations that apparently response to sources, environmental conditions and residence time. These findings provide a new tracer approach that will strongly enhance the application of anthropogenic I- 129 in ocean environments and impact on climate at the ocean boundary layer...|$|R
40|$|Eutrophication and algal blooms pose {{environmental}} and economical issues in freshwater lakes globally. Algal bloom development is primarily attributed to phosphorus (P), {{which can be}} released from lake bottom sediments under certain environmental conditions. Simultaneous to P release, arsenic (As), which is a geochemical P analogue, can be mobilized from sediments and exert toxicity in aquatic organisms. Recent studies within the Canadian prairies have focused on concerns regarding water scarcity and the increased development of algal blooms. However, lake sediments within the Canadian prairies, which are susceptible to P and As mobilization, have received little attention. Using a regionally important freshwater lake (Buffalo Pound Lake, SK, Canada), {{the goal of this}} study was to identify <b>environmental</b> mechanisms and <b>geochemistry</b> that influenced P and As mobilization from Canadian prairie lake sediment. Laboratory sediment core incubation experiments demonstrated that warm temperatures (19 °C) had the greatest influence on P mobilization from sediment, followed by high pH (pH= 9. 2), and then low dissolved oxygen (DO) concentrations (< 1 mg O 2 L- 1). High pH had the greatest influence on As mobilization from sediment, followed by warm temperatures, and then low DO concentration. The content of total P, relatively labile P fractions, and total As in sediment were not significantly different among sites. However, concentrations of aluminum (Al) and iron (Fe), common P and As sorbents in sediment, were significant different among sites. In sediment core incubations, the site that displayed less P and As mobilization under anoxic conditions also contained greater concentrations of Al in sediment. Redox-insensitive Al likely mitigated P and As mobilization under anoxic conditions, as evident by decreased P and As mobilization. Phosphorus and As were also mobilized from sediment in situ during ephemeral periods of bottom water stratification and suboxia. Although these conditions are known to facilitate P release in Fe-poor, polymictic lakes, this paradigm appears to also apply to As mobilization. Similar to the laboratory results, less P and As were mobilized in situ from sediment containing greater Al content. Overall, results demonstrated that, in addition to the above <b>environmental</b> variables, sediment <b>geochemistry</b> has a major influence on P and As mobilization from sediment in this Canadian prairie lake. Overall, it is important to determine concentrations of geochemical sorbents (i. e., Fe and Al) when studying P and As mobilization in shallow freshwater lakes globally...|$|R
