500|$|B in the Mix: The Remixes {{received}} little promotion compared to Spears' standards. A promotional extended play (EP) titled Key Cuts from Remixed with several remixes from {{the album was}} released in September 2005. A contest was launched on Spears' paid fan site for those who pre-ordered the album. The winner received a copy of , a bottle of Spears' fragrance Fantasy with an additional lotion and make-up kit, and a personalized autographed picture of Spears. On November 22, 2005, the day the album was released, a release party was held at an unspecified nightclub in Los Angeles, California, organized by Spears' management and the webmaster of the fansite WorldOfBritney.com. It was a limited event to five hundred people, including members of the fansite or her official fan club. Spears commented: [...] "I {{just wanted to say}} that I love the idea of all my fans getting together to celebrate the release of my new album. I was happy to help! I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> great night out at the club and dance all night long!".|$|E

6000|$|... "Don't mind me," [...] said Mr. Crewe, {{waving a}} hand in the {{direction}} of the salmon-coloured tickets; [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good time, General. When do you go?" ...|$|E
60|$|Good evening, Thompson. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{comfortable}} journey.|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{name is not}} Tizzy," [...] {{said the}} younger; [...] "it's Eliza. How do you do, sir? I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> fine hunt! Was papa well up, Jack?" ...|$|R
6000|$|At {{two o'clock}} that night Carry was awakened to see Patty bending over her, flushed and radiant. Carry sat sleepily up. [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good time," [...] she said.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Jobson sighed. [...] "Well, I shall 'ave {{to go back}} to bed again, then," [...] he said, ruefully. [...] "So long, mother. <b>Hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{pleasant}} time at the Palace." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good {{seat at the}} exercises," [...] he said, {{pressing}} Wetherell's hand again, {{and before}} he could thank him, Bob was {{off in the direction}} of the band stand.|$|E
6000|$|In {{the dining-room}} their inquisitional acquaintance, the waitress, fairly ran to them. [...] "Sit down, folks. Waffles this morning. You want {{to stock up}} for your drive. My, ain't it an elegant morning! I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> swell drive today!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{motive for}} killing him," [...] {{continued}} Fisher, mildly. [...] "You see, it's rather a curious situation. If <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> motive for murdering, you probably didn't murder. But if you hadn't any motive, why, then perhaps, you did." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Tom," [...] said Tizzy, {{addressing}} {{her father}} across the table, [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good run to-day." [...] It did seem odd {{to me that}} young lady should call her father Tom, but such was the fact.|$|R
6000|$|He {{carried her}} {{letters in the}} side-pocket of his coat till the {{envelopes}} were worn at the edges and nearly covered with smudged pencil-notes about things {{he wanted to keep}} in mind and would, of course, have kept in mind without making notes. He kept finding new meanings in her letters. He wanted them to indicate that she loved him; and any ambiguous phrase signified successively that she loved, laughed at, loathed, and loved him. Once he got up from bed {{to take another look at}} a letter and see whether she had said, [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> dear good time at the Explorers' Club dinner," [...] or [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good time, dear." ...|$|R
60|$|Forster {{will tell}} you with what men we must do the play, and what laurels we would propose {{to leave for the}} {{gathering}} of new aspirants; of whom I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> reasonable stock in your part of the country.|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not," [...] said Leo, [...] "for to say truth I don't much {{relish the}} idea of rowing over an unknown sea an unknown {{distance}} {{at the rate of}} three or four miles an hour. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> patent steam-engine that will drive us along somewhat faster." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll see you out," [...] said Sam soothingly, and led {{him through}} the outer office {{and on to the}} landing outside. [...] "Well, good luck, Peters," [...] he said, as they stood {{at the head of the}} stairs. [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{pleasant}} trip. Why, what's the matter? You seem upset." ...|$|E
6000|$|Catherine found Mrs. Allen just {{returned}} from all the busy idleness of the morning, and was immediately greeted with, [...] "Well, my dear, here you are," [...] a truth which she had no greater inclination than power to dispute; [...] "and I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> pleasant airing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Jane departed, and Violet {{felt as if}} she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{friend and}} {{protector}} the less. She was sitting forlorn in the great drawing-room, waiting for Arthur, who was trying horses; presently Theodora came in, and with something of compassion, said, 'I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> entertaining book there.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> {{message for}} <b>you</b> from Gilbert about your brother Bryan,' she said, {{and he could}} not defend himself from manifesting eager interest, as she told of the tea-party; but that over, it was in stiff formal English that he said, 'I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> good account.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Mr. Mayor," [...] he said, [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> good list of {{recruits}} for me. I don't want to {{be waiting}} here, for I {{have to go on}} a similar errand to other towns. It is not a job I like, I can tell you, but it is not for me to question orders." ...|$|E
6000|$|The night clerk {{was still}} at the desk, {{as though he had}} slept standing. He hailed them. [...] "Well, well! Up bright and early! Hope you folks slept well. Beds aren't so good as they might be, but we're kind of {{planning}} to get some new mattresses. But you get pretty good air to sleep in. <b>Hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> fine hike today." ...|$|E
6000|$|How much shocked Mrs. Samuel was, {{when the}} {{magnificent}} Sir Ferdinand, whom she regarded with awe as a millionaire, was flippantly answered by this extraordinary Sister, [...] "Thank you, Fernan, I {{should like to}} have a sight of the old office. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> descendant of the old cat, Betty. Didn't she come from your grandmother, Marilda? Do you remember her being found playing tricks with the nugget, just come from Victoria?" ...|$|E

60|$|PATIOMKIN [effusively]. Darling, I am a man; {{and you are}} a man; and Catherine is a woman. Woman reduces us all to {{the common}} denominator. [Chuckling.] Again an epigram!

6000|$|... "Just Sid Todd, miss, that's {{good enough}} for me," [...] said the cowboy, as the others shook hands with him, one after the other. [...] "I ain't used to no handle, I ain't. The boss {{thought you might be}} on this train, but he wasn't sure when I left. He told me to keep an eye open for <b>you,</b> though. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> nice trip." ...|$|R
60|$|The thrushes {{are singing}} now {{as if they}} would speak to the winds, because their big brother Jack, the Spring, was not far off. I am reading Voltaire and Gibbon, {{although}} I wrote to Reynolds the other day to prove reading of no use; I have not seen Hunt since, I am a good deal with Dilke and Brown, we are very thick; they are very kind to me, they are well. I don't think I could stop in Hampstead but for their neighbourhood. I hear Hazlitt's lectures regularly, his last was on Gray, Collins, Young, etc., and he gave a very fine piece of discriminating Criticism on Swift, Voltaire, and Rabelais. I was very disappointed at his treatment of Chatterton. I generally meet with many I know there. Lord Byron's 4th Canto is expected out, and I heard somewhere, that Walter Scott has a new Poem in readiness. I am sorry that Wordsworth has left a bad impression wherever he visited in town by his egotism, Vanity, and bigotry. Yet {{he is a great}} poet if not a philosopher. I have not yet read Shelley's Poem, I do not suppose you have it yet, at the Teignmouth libraries. These double letters must come rather heavy, I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> moderate portion of cash, but don't fret at all, if you have not--Lord! I intend to play at cut and run as well as Falstaff, that is to say, before he got so lusty.|$|E
5000|$|Laurel and Hardy {{are sent}} upstairs, as the widow tells her butler {{to make sure}} all the doors and windows are locked. She tells Ollie, [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> nice, long sleep", as the butler plays [...] "Taps" [...] on a trumpet.|$|E
5000|$|June 21, 1879: The stage from La Porte, Plumas County to Oroville, Butte County. Bart {{said to the}} driver, [...] "Sure <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> lot of gold in that strongbox, I'm nearly out of money." [...] In fact, {{the stage}} held no Wells Fargo gold or cash.|$|E
6000|$|He {{spent the}} night at a lonely cothouse {{on the edge of a}} peat-moss and reached the Garth next afternoon. John let him in and after taking his mackintosh remarked: [...] "Mr. and Mrs. Featherstone are out, but Miss Featherstone is at home; I will let her know <b>you</b> <b>have</b> arrived." [...] Then he paused and added in a half-apologetic tone: [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{pleasant}} journey, sir." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr Job Potterson,' Mr Inspector continued, 'I drink your health. Mr Jacob Kibble, I drink yours. <b>Hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made <b>a</b> prosperous voyage home, gentlemen both.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Ah!” exclaimed Mrs. Jaques, and beamed upon him. “I understand. I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made <b>a</b> wise choice. Falling in love {{is rather}} a serous thing. I suppose she’s pretty?” ...|$|R
5000|$|On 31 July 2012, Júlio César stated his {{intention}} to leave Inter, saying, [...] "They have been seven beautiful and successful years, but, in a few days, my adventure with the Inter shirt will end.

50|$|His novels Assassins & Victims and The Punctual Rape won Scottish Arts Council Awards. The Last Darkness and White Rage were {{nominated}} for the Prix du Polar. His quartet of Glasgow novels consists of The Bad Fire, The Last Darkness, White Rage, and Butcher. He also wrote a memoir titled All That Really Matters, retitled in the United States as I <b>Hope</b> <b>You</b> <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> Good Life.|$|E
50|$|The CSSG was the {{successor}} to the Force Maintenance Area (FMA), which was already using the Blackadder flash following its formation in 1990 in the deserts of Saudi Arabia. The then commander of the FMA, Brigadier Martin White, recognised {{the need for a}} sense of identity and found inspiration in a letter from his daughter in which she quipped 'I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> cunning plan'. And so it was not long before the transit camps in the port of Al Jubail were named after characters from the programme: Baldrick Lines, Blackadder Camp, Meltchett Lines and Camp Bob.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Kennedy," [...] he said, pleasantly. [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> {{good time}} in the holidays. I suppose Silver <b>has</b> told <b>you</b> the melancholy news--that you are to desert us this term? It is a great pity. We shall all be very sorry to lose you. I don't {{look forward to seeing}} you bowl us all out in the house-matches next summer," [...] he added, with a smile, [...] "though we shall expect a few full-pitches to leg, for the sake of old times." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> nice day," [...] he said, [...] "and won't be {{too tired}} {{when you get}} home. These {{excursions}} are rather hard work. Remember me to your mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>hope</b> <b>you</b> are <b>having</b> <b>a</b> good time. We always wish {{our young}} friends to <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{especially}} good time at Gertrude's parties," [...] Mrs. Cowles sniffed, and bowed away.|$|R
