25|$|The University of London is a collegiate and {{a federal}} {{research}} university located in London, England. The University was incorporated originally by royal charter in 1836 and is, at present, incorporated by royal charter granted in 1863. It is now governed by the University of London Act 1994 and by the Statutes made under it. The university currently consists of 18 constituent colleges, nine research institutes {{and a number of}} central bodies. The collegiate university houses the second-oldest medical school in London, and was the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> women as degree candidates in the United Kingdom and also the first to appoint a female as its Vice Chancellor in the United Kingdom.|$|E

In 1855 North Western Christian University [...] was chartered by Ovid Butler after a split with the Christian Church Disciples of Christ over slavery.

It was one of the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> African Americans {{and one of the first}} to have a named chair for female professors. Asbury College (now Depauw University) was Methodist.

Indiana lagged the rest of the Midwest with the lowest literacy and education rates into the early 20th century.|$|E

[...] While the Mexican Football Association did not object, they deferred to FIFA headquarters in Zurich for an official ruling. FIFA ruled against mixed-sex football teams stating, [...] "There must be a clear separation between men's and women's football." [...] Furthermore, a ban was placed on Domínguez for playing in an exhibition game outside the league but still alongside men.

500|$|Berridge {{defended the}} family, saying that Tahil's {{departure}} {{caused a lot}} of problems, however, she added, [...] "he Ferreiras have not been as successful as we had hoped. I think in retrospect we made a mistake in giving their entrance such a fanfare as a New Asian Family. Viewers traditionally {{take a long time to}} adapt to anyone new [...] so it was wrong to emphasise what was different about this family from the start. Even so, we had a terrific first story for them, which was to have culminated in a huge, action storyline to mark the exit of their father. However, the sudden removal of actor Dalip Tahil, for reasons beyond our control, meant that the story had to be abandoned quickly – and 40 scripts rewritten on the spot. The result was the transplant story, which I have to admit did go on for far too long, especially when our biggest story in this period had also to be abandoned because of the pregnancy of Kacey Ainsworth. The writers and production team did their very best under these circumstances but I would be the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> the end result was not our finest hour. I hope that viewers will not hold this against the Ferreira family and will be prepared to watch the next stage of their stories with an open mind. This is a very talented bunch of actors, who've had to put up with a lot of stick for problems which have not been of their making. Viewer response to their lighter material was very favourable and I am confident the Ferreiras will regain their popularity." [...] Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, said the show became overdependent on the kidney transplant storyline as there were several cast problems, such as illness, pregnancy, rehab and a car crash. Berridge quit as executive producer of EastEnders and was replaced by Kathleen Hutchison.|$|E

2500|$|A {{particularly}} well-known {{example is}} Arthur Conan Doyle's fictionalization of the Danites in A Study in Scarlet, the first Sherlock Holmes novel, published in 1887. In the story, the Danites constitute a brutal group of enforcing vigilantes {{operating under the}} direction of Brigham Young—and more particularly the fictional Sacred Council of Four, silencing criticism and questioning, and preventing dissenters from leaving the Salt Lake Valley. Doyle's embellishment of the folklore surrounding the original Missouri band transplanted to a romantic wild west setting, the established criminal notoriety of Rockwell, and rumors of Young's Avenging Angels made acceptance of the [...] "authoritative" [...] Sherlock story a simple matter for English readers.

2500|$|After Australia's biggest {{defeat at}} home in 50 years the Australian press were in uproar and the {{selectors}} Ewart Macmillan, Jack Ryder and Don Bradman took drastic action, dropping the captain Brian Booth, batsman Bob Cowper and the bowlers Garth McKenzie, Peter Philpott and David Sincock. Booth {{received a letter from}} Bradman on behalf of the selectors explaining [...] "Never before have I written to a player to express my regret at his omission from the Australian XI. In your case I am making an exception because I want you to know how much my colleagues and I disliked having to make this move. Captain one match and out of the side the next looks like ingratitude, but you understand the circumstances and will be the <b>first</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that your form has not been good." [...] Booth had made only 84 runs (16.80) in the series and never played for Australia again. Cowper was blamed for slow scoring even though he had made 99 and 60 in the Second and Third Tests. Peter Allan of Queensland was brought back into the side after he had taken the third best bowling figures in Australia – 10/61 in the first innings against Victoria, but was injured and McKenzie was restored to the team. The off-spinner Tom Veivers and young batsmen Ian Chappell were called up and Keith Stackpole made his Test debut, so Australia went to Adelaide with only three specialist bowlers – McKenzie, Hawke and Veivers. England simply kept the same XI from Sydney, even though this meant that Geoff Boycott was their third place bowler after Jeff Jones and Dave Brown. Mike Smith won the toss and decided to bat.|$|E

2500|$|Such vows, it is obvious, are {{sometimes}} made impulsively or {{in moments of}} panic, desperation or some other strong emotion, and would be impossible, impractical, or ruinous to fulfill (e.g. the impetuous [...] "vow" [...] – נדר neder [...] — made by Jephthah, in Judges 11:30, to sacrifice his daughter in return for victory in battle; a [...] "self-imposed obligation" [...] (in the KJV [...] "binding oneself") – אסר osar [...] which is the term used repeatedly in Numbers chapter 30 to describe a sort of commitment a wife might make that the husband could nullify; the regretted [...] "oath" [...] – שׁבע shava [...] – made at Mizpah to cause the tribe of Benjamin to dwindle nearly to extinction, Judges 21:7; a similar shava [...] made by Saul, which {{would have resulted in}} his son's execution but for the acclamation of the entire army, First Samuel, chapt. 14, etc.). The next word (in some editions) [...] "consecration" [...] -חרמי haromay is used for things whose use is devoted (usually to the Temple) as in Leviticus 27:21 & 28. After this point Amram's Hebrew version ceases to list forms of vows and shifts to synonyms for the making of vows, the list in the present day Kol Nidre uses Aramaic non-Biblical synonyms for pledges, which do not have equivalents in Biblical Hebrew, such as קונמי konamay - used in the Talmud for a vow by which a tool or furnishing is forbidden for mundane use because pledged to Temple usage, and קנוסי kinusay - used in the Talmud as a synonym for konamay. Though these promises to God may have been ill-considered, the failure to keep them is a recurring offense – and acting as if promises made to God were so trifling that they could be thoughtlessly forgotten is a further offense; the only remedy is, <b>first,</b> <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> that these promises will never be fulfilled, by formally cancelling them – {{which is one of the}} purposes of the Kol Nidrei, and then to repent for them – which is the purpose of the Day of Atonement. It has even been suggested that Kol Nidrei includes vows that had been fulfilled, because the Torah forbids the making of vows, so that even those which were kept required atonement. There is also a kabbalistic or spiritual purpose to Kol Nidrei: God has vowed, in Scripture, to punish Jewry for its sins; therefore by demonstrating that we can and do cancel our own vows, we hope to induce God to cancel his own dire decrees.|$|E
