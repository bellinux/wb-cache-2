In an interview with Ben Fong-Torres of Rolling Stone, Charles said of the similarities between the blues and country music, [...] "he words to country songs are very earthy like the blues, see, very down. They're not as dressed up, and the people are very honest and say, 'Look, I miss you, darlin', so I went out and I got drunk in this bar.' That's the way you say it. Where in Tin Pan Alley will say, 'Oh, <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>you</b> darling, so I went to this restaurant and I sat down and I had dinner for one.' That's cleaned up now, you see? But country songs and the blues is like it is." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Dwight Schrute {{character}} {{has had a}} very positive reception, and is often cited {{as one of the}} most popular characters on the show. According to Entertainment Weekly he is one of the [...] "greatest sidekicks." [...] In TV Guide's list of the top 100 characters in television history, Dwight was ranked 85th. [...] In an ABC News interview with Rainn Wilson, the interviewer commented that [...] "Words barely describe Dwight Schrute, the suck-up salesman and assistant to the regional manager of the Scranton branch for the Dunder Mifflin Paper Company..." [...] and [...] "Dwight, as played by the 41-year-old Wilson, has become one of the breakout characters in television comedy. Dwight is a survivalist geek, a student of karate who likes to shoot a crossbow and watch [...] "Battlestar Galactica" [...] on television. And he takes himself very, very seriously..." [...] E! News commented that Rainn Wilson should be nominated for an Emmy Award for his performance of Dwight, commenting: [...] "...Who's laughing now? Who's laughing now, Dwight Schrute? Oh, only the ten million-plus people who watched as you pepper sprayed the living daylights out of Roy for trying to pop Jim in the face last night. My God, have <b>I</b> <b>missed</b> <b>you,</b> man. Mr. Schrute, you are the reason I love my job, my friend. It is the selflessly heroic actions of a man such as you that make television a nice place to be on a Thursday night. You may just be an everyday citizen who does not accept prizes for being a citizen, but you'd best be accepting a supporting actor Emmy nod this year, because, hot damn if you don't deserve it." ...|$|E

What has really happened, dear? I can't realise anything. I feel as though the gates of some great prison had been thrown wide-open, and everything there was to long for in life was just there, within reach, waiting. I am glad, so much gladder than I should have imagined possible. It's wonderful to have you again.
