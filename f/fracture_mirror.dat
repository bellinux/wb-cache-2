40|$|A {{reliable}} {{assessment of the}} edge strength becomes an important issue when designing structural glass elements in buildings. However, in the literature the edge strength of glass, dependent on the edge quality, is not well documented. Therefore, in this study an edge strength model was established and validated for commonly used edge finishings, namely ground, arrissed and cut. After testing at a high stress rate, the <b>fracture</b> <b>mirror</b> zone depth and the flaw depth were measured. For every edge finishing a reliable ratio between the <b>fracture</b> <b>mirror</b> zone depth and the initial flaw depth was found. A strength model based on the measurement of the mirror zone depth was established and validated, as the measurement of the mirror zone is much easier than the measurement of the flaw depth. Also, the mirror zone depth is independent of the loading rate and can be useful for forensic engineering...|$|E

40|$|This article {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation into the}} effects of temperature and heating time on the tensile strength and failure mechanisms of glass fibers. The loss in strength of two glass fiber types (E-glass and Advantex®, a boron-free version of E-glass) was investigated at temperatures up to 650 °C and heating times up to 2 h. The tensile properties were measured by fiber bundle testing, and the maximum strength {{was found to be}} temperature and time dependent. The higher softening point of the Advantex® fibers is reflected in superior high-temperature performance. A phenomenological model is presented for calculating the residual strength of glass fiber bundles as functions of temperature and time. The strength reduction mechanism was determined by single-fiber testing. <b>Fracture</b> <b>mirror</b> sizes on the E-glass fibers were related to the fiber strength after high-temperature treatment. Based on <b>fracture</b> <b>mirror</b> measurements, it was established that (1) the mirror constant of the glass, which reflects the network structure, does not change during heat treatment and (2) the strength degradation is a result of larger surface flaws present after heat treatment...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{investigation into the}} large reductions to the tensile fracture stress and the associated strength loss mechanism of E-glass fibres during thermal recycling. Fractographic analysis reveals the fracture process is controlled by surface flaws, irrespective of heat treatment temperature and duration. The fracture toughness is an important material property {{in order to understand}} possible changes in the strength-flaw relationship during heat treatment. Focussed ion beam (FIB) milling is used to artificially create a single nano-sized deep notch (between 30 and 1000 nm) in glass fibres. The strength loss, fracture toughness, <b>fracture</b> <b>mirror</b> constant and fracture mechanism observed for nano-notched and thermally recycled fibres are identical, indicating bulk property changes do not occur during thermal recycling. The study proves conclusively that surface flaw growth is the controlling mechanism reducing fibreglass strength during thermal recycling of waste polymer composites...|$|E

40|$|Standard glass {{optical fiber}} was {{intentionally}} damaged and strength tested in tension {{for a wide}} range of failure stress values. The mirror/mist boundary on each specimen was measured and compared to the measured failure stress. When the size of the <b>fracture</b> <b>mirror</b> is small compared to the fiber diameter, the well-known linear square root dependence of strength on mirror size was reaffirmed. However, when the mirror size approaches the fiber diameter, this relationship does not hold. The classical relationship overestimates the failure stress for large mirrors. It was determined that the circular shape of the fiber contributes to, but can not fully account for, departure from the classical strength/mirror relationship. A new empirical relationship was developed to enable predictive determinations of failure stress to levels as low as 20 to 25 kpsi (0. 14 to 0. 17 GPa). 1...|$|E
40|$|The tensile {{strength}} of commercial glass fibers is examined by single fiber tensile tests. The fibers are analysed as {{received from the}} manufacturer (sized) and after a heat treatment at 500 ºC (unsized). Weibull plots of the two series are used for comparison of {{the strengths of the}} sized and unsized fibers. It is shown that large sample sizes (over 60 tests) are required to lead to a reliable two-parameter Weibull distribution. The experimental tests clearly indicated that the unsized fibers were weaker in the low strength range, but had similar strength in the high strength range. An investigation of the fracture surfaces in the SEM showed distinct differences in the fracture patterns for high and low strength fibers. Fracture mechanics were applied to estimate the original flaw size and relate the observed <b>fracture</b> <b>mirror</b> surface to the fiber strength. Based on the observation of surface flaws, a "healing" mechanism by the sizing is considered likely for this type of fiber and sizing, thereby effectively increasing the strength of the fiber in the presence of larger surface flaws...|$|E
40|$|Titanium matrix {{composites}} (TMCs) {{reinforced with}} Sigma 1140 + SiC fiber have been manufactured {{by a combination}} of low pressure plasma spraying (LPPS spray/wind) and simultaneous fiber winding, followed by vacuum hot pressing (VHP). Fiber damage during TMC manufacture has been evaluated by measuring fiber tensile strength after fiber extraction from the TMCs at various processing stages, followed by fitting of these data to a Weibull distribution function. The LPPS spray/wind processing caused a decrease in mean fiber strength and Weibull modulus in comparison with as-received fibers. A number of fiber surface flaws, primarily in the outer C layer of the fiber, formed as a result of mechanical impact of poorly melted particles from the plasma spray. Coarse feedstock powders promoted an increase in the population of fiber surface flaws, leading to significant reduction in fiber strength. The VHP consolidation promoted further development of fiber surface flaws by fiber bending and stress localization because of nonuniform matrix shrinkage, resulting in further degradation in fiber strength. In the extreme case of fibers touching, the stress concentration on the fibers was sufficient to cause fiber cracking. Fractographic studies revealed that low strength fibers failed by surface flaw induced failure and contained a large <b>fracture</b> <b>mirror</b> zone. Compared with the more widely investigated foil-fiber-foil route to manufacture TMCs. LPPS/VHP resulted in less degradation in fiber strength for Sigma 1140 + fiber.

These approaches serve to intensify the act of looking. Camilla Wilson’s paintings deal with the representation of interior spaces, some glimpsed and <b>fractured</b> in <b>mirrors.</b> The interiors themselves provide small stages of a sort, presenting an illusion of completeness, undermined by internal repetitions, reversals, other interruptions, or projected light, which break the seamlessness of pictorial space.

Intra operative fracture site biopsy revealed marked osteopenia and hence the patient was treated for osteoporosis. DiscussionBoth fractures united well at 14 weeks. At final follow up of 6 years there were no radiological signs of implant loosening and the patient was able to walk without any aids and had a range of 80 ° and 60 ° flexion in {{the right and left}} knees respectively.

Book Series: IUTAM Bookseries. Editor: Borodich FM. Volume: 10, 37 - 47 Real-time {{control of}} the {{direction}} of a propagating crack is little explored area of management of structural integrity. We have examined it with experiments on quasi-static (slow) cracks in PMMA (Polymethyl-Methacrylate). We have observed that in PMMA when the mean crack speeds are low (between 0. 1 and 0. 4 mm/s) secondary thermal sources of relatively low power (of the order of 2 W) can be used to achieve a significant crack redirection. In this interval the micro-photographs of cracks present a fishbone structure, and we argue that the side lobes arc: micro-cracks which appear inside shear bands. The respective fracture surfaces look rippled (hackled). We have observed a clear reverse correlation between the crack speed and the angle of redirection. When the mean crack speed exceeds 0. 4 mm/s) and the <b>fracture</b> surface is <b>mirror</b> smooth no trajectory redirection is achieved. It appears the micro-cracks act as notches and alleviate crack redirection. Therefore, one of our conclusions is that {{it might be possible to}} use relatively weak sources to redirect fast cracks that propagate with a super-critical speed. This hypothesis is advanced because fast cracks are also known to possess a fishbone structure and hackled fracture surface. Non peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|To {{experimentally}} validate a non-linear {{finite element}} analysis (FEA) modeling approach assessing in-vitro fracture risk at the proximal femur and to transfer the method to standard in-vivo multi-detector computed tomography (MDCT) data of the hip aiming to predict additional hip fracture risk in subjects with and without osteoporosis associated vertebral fractures using bone mineral density (BMD) measurements as gold standard. One fresh-frozen human femur specimen was mechanically tested and fractured simulating stance and clinically relevant fall loading configurations to the hip. After experimental in-vitro validation, the FEA simulation protocol was transferred to standard contrast-enhanced in-vivo MDCT images to calculate individual hip fracture risk each for 4 subjects with and without a history of osteoporotic vertebral fractures matched by age and gender. In addition, FEA based risk factor calculations were compared to manual femoral BMD measurements of all subjects. In-vitro simulations showed good correlation with the experimentally measured strains both in stance (R 2 = 0. 963) and fall configuration (R 2 = 0. 976). The simulated maximum stress overestimated the experimental failure load (4743 N) by 14. 7 % (5440 N) while the simulated maximum strain overestimated by 4. 7 % (4968 N). The simulated failed elements coincided precisely with the experimentally determined fracture locations. BMD measurements in subjects {{with a history of}} osteoporotic vertebral fractures did not differ significantly from subjects without fragility fractures (femoral head: p = 0. 989; femoral neck: p = 0. 366), but showed higher FEA based risk factors for additional incident hip fractures (p = 0. 028). FEA simulations were successfully validated by elastic and destructive in-vitro experiments. In the subsequent in-vivo analyses, MDCT based FEA based risk factor differences for additional hip <b>fractures</b> were not <b>mirrored</b> by according BMD measurements. Our data suggests, that MDCT derived FEA models may assess bone strength more accurately than BMD measurements alone, providing a valuable in-vivo fracture risk assessment tool...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE This study {{evaluated}} whether intraoperative imaging with computer-assisted virtual reconstruction {{would be}} advantageous in reconstructions of {{orbital floor fracture}}s. The surgeon's intention to revise a reconstructed primary orbital floor fracture by evaluating a postoperative mirrored computed tomographic (CT) scan was analyzed intraoperatively before wound closure, during inpatient hospitalization, and after hospitalization. The inter-rater agreement and the match of intention to revise and actual revision were analyzed. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fifty-one anonymized postoperative CT scans of patients with a unilateral orbital floor <b>fracture</b> were <b>mirrored</b> using software. These computer-assisted virtual reconstructions were consecutively examined by 4 examiners. Seven of these patients underwent a revision. In the first part, the inter-rater agreements for all 3 times were analyzed. In the second part, the examiners' intentions to revise were compared with the actual performed revisions. RESULTS The overall inter-rater agreements were 0. 69 for the intraoperative phase, 0. 55 for the in-hospital phase, and 0. 39 for the post-hospital phase. The intraoperative inter-rater agreement for each examiner was 0. 58 to 0. 80. The Fleiss κ value for the in-hospital and post-hospital phases was lower. The comparison of the examiners' intention to revise and the actual revisions showed that 15 to 24 additional would have been revised. In contrast, 6 of 7 actual revisions would have been revised intraoperatively. The missed actual revision was the same case by all 4 examiners. The accordance of intention to revise with the actual revisions decreased during hospitalization and even more after hospitalization. This study showed strong agreement among examiners for revising anatomically incorrectly reduced orbital floor fractures intraoperatively by evaluating postoperative mirrored CT scans. During the in-hospital and post-hospital phases, the restraints against revision seemed to increase, thus leading to poorer inter-rater agreement. This analysis of postoperative CT scans with computer-assisted virtual reconstructions of the orbit would have led to considerably more revisions intraoperatively, but all actual revisions were detected except for 1 case. This case was {{the same for all}} 4 examiners. Operation time would have been prolonged in the additional revised cases, but a better anatomic reconstruction would have been achieved. Furthermore, the intraoperative result of the reconstruction would have been controlled instantly and corrected immediately, if needed. CONCLUSION This study showed that of 6 of 7 actual revisions, implant placement would have been revised intraoperatively by all 4 examiners, if intraoperative imaging with computer-assisted virtual reconstruction of the orbit would have been applied. Therefore, the authors suggest that intraoperative imaging with computer-assisted virtual reconstruction could be advantageous in the prevention of later revisions of orbital floor fractures. In this study, the threshold to revise implant placement intraoperatively seemed to be lower when using intraoperative imaging with virtual reconstructions, because considerably more cases would have been revised intraoperatively by the examiners. In the in-hospital and post-hospital phases, this threshold increased, suggesting the more important role of clinical findings. It is uncertain whether the actual surgeons would have revised the same cases as the examiners if they had used intraoperative imaging with virtual reconstructions for their deliberation. However, the intraoperative inter-rater agreement was good and cost-intensive postoperative revisions might be prevented...|$|R
