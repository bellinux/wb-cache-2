The results obtained are as follows：Shapes of cross section of suction nozzles：Those which conformed to the shapes of <b>impeller</b> <b>suction</b> inlets reveald best in efficiency. The outer surface of impeller：As the roughness increased, the pump efficiency was decreased since the increase of disk friction loss was accompanied by {{the influence of the}} flow within the space between the impeller and its casing, while the total head was seen somewhat increased...|$|E
40|$|Pump pre-swirl or uneven flow {{distribution}} {{in front of}} the pump can induce pump-intake vortices. These phenomena result in blockage of the <b>impeller</b> <b>suction</b> space, deterioration of efficiency, drop of head curve and earlier onset of cavitation. Real problematic case, where head curve drop was documented, is simulated using commercial CFD software. Computational simulation was carried out for three flow rates, which correspond to three operating regimes of the vertical pump. The domain consists of the pump sump, pump itself excluding the impeller and the delivery pipe. One-phase approach is applied, because the vortex cores were not filled with air during observation of the real pump operation. Numerical simulation identified two surface vortices and one bottom vortex. Their position and strength depend on the pump flow rate. Paper presents detail analysis of the flow field on the pump intake, discusses influence of the vortices on pump operation and suggests possible actions that should be taken to suppress the intake vortices...|$|E
5000|$|The air escapes {{through the}} pump {{discharge}} nozzle whilst the fluid drops {{back down and}} is once more entrained by the <b>impeller.</b> The <b>suction</b> line is thus continuously evacuated. The design required for such a self-priming feature has an adverse effect on pump efficiency. Also, {{the dimensions of the}} separating chamber are relatively large. For these reasons this solution is only adopted for small pumps, e.g. garden pumps. More frequently used types of self-priming pumps are side channel and water ring pumps. Another type of self-priming pump is a centrifugal pump with two casing chambers and an open impeller. This design is not only used for its self-priming capabilities but also for its degassing effects when pumping twophase mixtures (air/gas and liquid) for a short time in process engineering or when handling polluted fluids, for example when draining water from construction pits.|$|R

There is {{a wide range of}} cavitation instabilities, which can be observed during inducer operation, even at the design flow rate. The type of cavitation instability is determined by the frequency analysis. Two cavitation models were used to determine the frequency range of four different types of cavitation instabilities – CEV and VOF built in the ANSYS CFX software – for a 3 -blade inducer and <b>suction</b> <b>impeller</b> of a multistage pump. The calculated values of NPSH 3 were compared with experimental data for SST, SST-SAS and RSM SSG turbulence models for fully unsteady solutions.

40|$|Lecturepg. 59 With the {{increase}} in power per unit of volume for modern pumps, driven by manufacturing costs reduction, cavitation {{becomes more and more}} the main limiting factor in pump design. The classical one-dimensional design rules applied for decades are no longer sufficient, and for this reason, there is a strong need for more accurate numerical tools to predict the cavitation behavior of pumps. An original cavitation prediction method is presented and its results are compared to experimental data for five pumps of specific speeds from 15 to 125 (775 to 6500 US units). The numerical method introduced in this paper for the prediction for the cavitation development in pumps is a simplified version of a previously developed program successfully used in similar cases. Motivation for this simplification was to allow the program usage during the design process of <b>suction</b> <b>impellers.</b> The accuracy of this simplified method as well as its usage as a design tool is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Many {{studies have}} shown that bionic forms reduce drag through the control fluid medium. In this study, the evenly aligned pits of the whirligig beetle (Gyrinidae Latreille) notum were {{selected}} as the bionic form to be studied. They were used in centrifugal compressor impellers, called bionic centrifugal compressors, and the flow characteristics were simulated and compared to the prototype compressor. The simulation results show that compared to the prototype compressor, the pressure drag of bionic centrifugal compressors was reduced dramatically, while the pressure ratio was significantly improved. The pressure drag decreased by 19. 24 %, while the compression ratio increased by 9. 8 %. The bionic form of the blade delayed the boundary layer separation of the <b>impeller</b> <b>suction</b> surface, reducing the turbulent kinetic energy loss and improving internal air flow. The effect of drag reduction was shown to have a close relationship with the dimple size and bionic surface area; the greater the area, the better the drag reduction effect. However, there should exist an optimal bionic area, which could be determined by considering the flow velocity inside the impeller...|$|E
40|$|Tutorialpg. 151 The {{essential}} elements {{to be reviewed}} when considering a centrifugal pump application are highlighted. The purpose is to ensure the procurement and/or application of a centrifugal pump which optimizes reliability, energy usage, maintenance costs, and achieves this in a safe manner. The {{need to understand the}} system hydraulics and complete process requirements is emphasized, as is the impact each system parameter has on pump design. The test is broken into three basic areas: pump boundaries conditions, flow requirements, and pump specification ? key elements. Pump boundary conditions addressed NPSH considerations as they relate to flow requirements, potential for cavitation damage, suction specific speed, and mechanical seal temperature margin. This section also addresses system resistance variations, and addresses the effects of variations in dynamic and static system heads and the potential prime causes of variations in these heads. Flow requirements discusses the determination of normal, maximum (or rated), and minimum flow requirements. A method of approximation of a pump?s minimum acceptable flowrate is presented (based on the pump?s hydraulic specifications), which utilizes suction specific speed and moderating factors such as impeller head, NPSH margin, specific gravity, etc. Attention is paid to the effect of excessive specified flow on NPSHA, flow rangeability, and suction specific speed. Mechanical and hydraulic interrelationships are discussed to emphasize how flowrate variations affect radial and axial thrust, <b>impeller</b> <b>suction</b> and discharge recirculation, and potential for cavitation; also covered are the effect of variation in running clearances and changes in specific gravity. Critical aspects of both parallel and series pump application are addressed. The dangers of incorrect parallel pump application are highlighted and guidelines are offered for correct application of parallel pumps. Series pump operation is discussed primarily in terms of percentage split in pumps? combined total head, pump protection and system protection. Pump Specification ? Key Elements addresses communicating to prospective pump vendors the key parameters that may determine the metallurgy, mechanical seal design and mechanical seal peripheral?s design, and pump hydraulic design best suited to the user?s requirements. The liquid specification is highlighted, the important site and operating conditions are addressed, and the importance of clearly defining the key performance requirements in full is discussed. The wrong pump, operated incorrectly coupled with poor maintenance practices, results in unsatisfactory hydraulic performance, high energy costs, high maintenance costs, poor reliability, and increases the potential for an unsafe failure. Proper specification and selection principles, coupled with the implementation of correct operating and maintenance practices, will result in optimized centrifugal pump application. The net result will be a pumping application that meets all process demands, with a minimum of energy usage, and low frequency of repair (high reliability), low overall maintenance costs, and low process debits. Key hydraulic and Performance Criteria are addressed along with their effects on performance, energy, reliability, energy, reliability, maintenance costs, and safety. The interrelationships that exist between hydraulic characteristics and the mechanical reliability is highlighted to ensure that neither are treated separately...|$|E
40|$|Lecturepg. 97 The suction-impeller (single-suction) of a 33, 500 hp, four-stage {{barrel pump}} used in boiler feed service at a fossil fuel steam plant {{experienced}} operating life ranging from 6. 0 to 19 months. Cavitation erosion on the suction surface {{and in the}} hub fillet area caused this unacceptably short life. This pump design is unique in that its suction-stage operates at an inlet tip velocity of 281 ft/sec. This tip speed, coupled with a stage pressure rise of about 1160 psi places this machine well {{into the category of}} ?high energy? pumps, and signals the need for special design attention to elements of its hydraulic design in order to provide suitable performance, reliability and operability. In a joint program with the user and the pump manufacturer, the problem was investigated, a test program conducted, redesign of the impeller completed and replacement impellers commissioned in the field. Elements of the investigation and test program included the <b>impeller</b> design itself, <b>suction</b> bay distortions and effects of distorted flow generated by the upstream piping. The redesign was accomplished through the use of sophisticated computational techniques and experimental flow visualization. The final design, referred to as a biased-wedge, was manufactured using a precision, lost wax casting process, with a special stereolithographic technique used to translate the final blade design into usable patterns. One of the final set of impellers was tested using flow visualization. The test program confirmed that the final design was free of cavitation bubbles at the baseload condition and significantly reduced vapor activity and hence damage potential at min-flow. The effects of flow distortions (on cavitation activity) presented to the <b>impeller</b> by the <b>suction</b> bay (so prevalent with the conventional design) was effectively countered by the biased-wedge design. Finally, the flow distortions (both introduction of swirl and uneven mass distribution) at the pump suction flange were modeled and tested with both conventional and biased-wedge impellers. In both cases, these distortions had no effect on the formation or collapse of cavitation vapor in the impeller eye. These conclusions are valid for only this single-suction type of configuration. The impellers have been commissioned in the field units and are currently accumulating operational hours...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 13 Following a brief {{description}} of the general suction performance of pumps and starting from an impeller designed for standard requirements, it will be discussed by which modifications and up to which limit the suction performance can be improved. In this context, it will be shown that the well-known measures ? e. g., enlargement of the impeller inlet diameter, reduction of the vane number or installation of an inducer ? may result in some restrictions concerning the possible operational range and may pose a risk of cavitation erosion. These undesirable consequences can, however, be avoided or at least moderated by modifications upstream of the <b>impeller.</b> The <b>suction</b> performance can also be improved by using double suction instead of single suction pumps. It is explained why the resulting improvement may not be as substantial as could be assumed at a first glace. Pumps with inlet velocities exceeding 25 to 30 m/s that are expected to run for 10, 000 hr and more without cavitation damage cannot operate at NPSH values corresponding to a 3. 0 percent head drop, even if a highly cavitation-resistant material is used. It is demonstrated that the design parameters of their impellers differ from those used for ?normal? impellers. If NPSHA is not sufficient, a booster pump has to be provided, or the rotational speed has to be reduced. As the latter is an expensive alternative, the question arises what the minimum booster pump head is. Some information regarding this issue is given. It will also be demonstrated that there is an upper limit of the rotational speed of the main pump beyond which can economical solution is impossible...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 103 Cavitation {{occurring}} in high-energy pump impellers {{often results in}} material erosion and system instabilities. Excessive erosion rates compromise life and increase ownership costs through higher maintenance and reduced availability. Instabilities in the pumping system resulting from the presence of unsteady volumes of vapor resulting pressure pulsations and unsteady flow delivery. This behavior is {{a legacy of the}} increase in pump size and energy level that were required to support larger and more critical processes. The increased requirements resulted in ?scaled-up? impeller designs that were not suited to deal with the resulting cavitation behavior. During the late 1980 s to 1990 s numerous development efforts were undertaken to correct these design issues. There has been little follow-up of these efforts so that the degree of success is largely undocumented. This paper revisits two such redesign efforts for boiler feed pumps that presented two separate challenges. Significant increases in cavitation life are documented by using design approaches developed during the early 1990 s. Also considered is the growing use of computational fluid dynamics for predicting cavitating behavior of critical <b>suction</b> <b>impellers...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{in brief}} an own application (numerical code) for quick {{design of the}} turbo machines impellers. Based on this numerical method, this paper analyses {{the influence of the}} blades' angles on the radial impeller geometry from the centrifugal pumps: the influence of the inlet and outlet angles of the blades over the hydraulic channel size, over the number of the blades and over the blades' angular extension. In centrifugal pumps design, a special attention must be given of the impeller inlet and outlet angles. These influences include also the pump efficiency, for 1 - 2 percent. The impeller design methods starting from the pump flow, the head, the rotation speed and ranging blades inlet and outlet angles, gives completely the <b>impeller</b> geometry -the <b>suction</b> and discharge diameters of the impeller, the number of blades and {{the size and shape of}} the hydraulic channel and estimates the efficiency for centrifugal pumps.

5000|$|Hoover's {{business}} {{began to}} flourish, and, {{a year after}} Hoover acquired the patent from Spangler, he established a research and development department for his new business. By 1926, Hoover had developed the 'beater bar' - a metal bar attached to the rotating brush roll, situated in the floor nozzle cavity of the upright vacuum cleaner. [...] Introduced on Models 543 and 700, the beater bars alternated with the sweeping brushes to vibrate the carpet while sucking. It provided a more distinct 'tap' than the bristle tufts used on the former machines, {{and led to a}} 101% increase in efficiency. This cleaning action was marketed by Hoover as [...] "Positive Agitation". 'It Beats...as it Sweeps...as it Cleans' rang more true now than ever. In 1929, Hoover introduced the Model 200 Duster. This would be their first attempt at a cylinder cleaner. It used a Model 575 motor with a modified <b>suction</b> <b>impeller,</b> which was mounted on a unique aluminum body with runners, allowing the cleaner to be pulled behind the user. The Duster was produced for only three months and roughly 9,000 were made.|$|R

Slurries {{by their very nature}} are very abrasive requiring the <b>impeller,</b> casing and <b>suction</b> liner wet end component parts be replaced at regular intervals. It is not uncommon, for example, for six liners, three impellers and two casings to be consumed in one year.

40|$|Lecturepg. 51 The proper {{selection}} of a centrifugal pump for liquid and gas (two phase) mixtures, is highly dependent {{on the amount of}} gas and the characteristics of the mixture. The presence of entrained gases will reduce the output of centrifugal pumps and can potentially cause loss of prime. Conventional pump designs can be used for low percentages by volume (up to four percent), while special impeller modifications are used effectively to handle five percent to 10 perfect gas by volume, although performance corrections are required for proper pump selection. Pump performance test data is presented for low to medium specific speed pumps (900 to 3000 U. S. units), pumping water with up to 10 percent entrained air.

40|$|In {{the present}} study, a reduced scale {{model of a}} {{low-pressure}} stage of a two-stage pump turbine was investigated when it operates in pump mode, which is as a centrifugal pump with vaned diffuser. An instability region was found in its Q-H curve. This instability region, centered into the flow rate interval between 0. 45 to 0. 7 QDes, restricts the stable operating range of the test pump. The object {{of this study was}} to analyze the origins and development of the unsteadiness inner pump during this saddle instability region, and to find the causes of this saddle, which could guide the design, and optimization of the test pump. Experimental and numerical approaches have been adopted to contribute the understanding on the highly complex flow interactions inside the test pump. The analyses pointed out that the instability of Q-H curve during this flow rate interval was mainly affected by the flow field unsteadiness into the diffuser. Severe flow separation occurred into the diffuser, affecting and/or affected by the unsteadiness from the impeller and return channel remarkably. Both at full and part load, due to the U shape stay vanes in the return system, a 3 -dimentional complex flow was found on the suction side of stay vane near the U turn corner. This flow caused a periodic unforced pressure disturbance with frequency St= 0. 6625 in the diffuser. A rotating stall with 5 cells into the diffuser was also highlighted by the experimental analyses and the numerical results validated that this disturbance was mainly due to the unsteady flow patterns in the return channel. With the reduction of flow rate, the location of this unsteadiness in return channel move closer to the outlet of diffuser, and the unsteadiness made the flow separation near the stay vane leading edge on the suction side more severe and it impacted the flow in diffuser flow field in a more severe way. At the same time, two types of unsteadiness were detected in the impeller in the saddle instability region. They were the flow separation with the frequency St= 0. 6625 at the <b>impeller</b> blade <b>suction</b> side and the wake-jet near the trailing edge of impeller blade with the frequency St= 0. 335, respectively. The wake-jet caused a periodic disturbance with a frequency of St= 0. 335 in diffuser as well. The experimental results indicated that it propagate circumferentially with 2 cells. At the beginning of this saddle instability, in diffuser, the intensity of the fluctuations at St= 0. 335 and St= 0. 6625 both increase with the falling flow rate. With the development of these unsteady patterns, they mixed and caused a blockage in the gap between impeller and diffuser. This blockage caused the increase of the amplitude at BPF, which has been detected both by experimental and numerical results. At the same time, the further development of the blockage weakened the intensity of the two disturbances with frequency of St= 0. 335 and St= 0. 6625 in the blockage region. The blockage fully developed near the critical flow rate of 0. 6 QDes. At this condition, the intensity of rotor and stator interaction increased and energy loss also increased which caused the drop of head and mean pressure at the exit of impeller. Furthermore, the disturbance in diffuser which caused by wake-jet of impeller lost the periodic character with frequency of St= 0. 335 at this condition. This is the reason why the non-linear component St= 0. 335 disappeared in diffuser around 0. 6 QDes...|$|R
