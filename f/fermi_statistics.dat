50|$|Wen {{introduced}} {{the notion of}} topological order (1989) and quantum order (2002), to describe {{a new class of}} matter states. This opens up a new research direction in condensed matter physics. He found that states with topological order contain non-trivial boundary excitations and developed chiral Luttinger theory for the boundary states (1990). The boundary states can become ideal conduction channel which may lead to device application of topological phases. He proposed the simplest topological order — Z2 topological order (1990), which {{turns out to be the}} topological order in the toric code. He also proposed a special class of topological order: non-Abelian quantum Hall states. They contain emergent particles with non-Abelian statistics which generalizes the well known Bose and <b>Fermi</b> <b>statistics.</b> Non-Abelian particles may allow us to perform fault tolerant quantum computations. With Michael Levin, he found that string-net condensations can give rise to a large class of topological orders (2005). In particular, string-net condensation provides a unified origin of photons, electrons, and other elementary particles (2003). It unifies two fundamental phenomena: gauge interactions and <b>Fermi</b> <b>statistics.</b> He pointed out that topological order is nothing but the pattern of long range entanglements. This led to a notion of symmetry protected topological (SPT) order (short-range entangled states with symmetry) and its description by group cohomology of the symmetry group (2011). The notion of SPT order generalizes the notion of topological insulator to interacting cases. He also proposed the SU(2) gauge theory of high temperature superconductors (1996).|$|E

Descartes held that there is a [...] "homunculus" [...] {{in the form of the}} soul, belonging to a form of natural substance known as res cogitans that obeyed different laws from those obeyed by solid matter (res extensa). Although Descartes' duality of natural substances may have echoes in modern physics (Bose and <b>Fermi</b> <b>statistics)</b> no agreed account of 'interpretation' has been formulated.

5000|$|During his {{graduate}} studies, Eckart co-authored a paper with Karl Compton, brother of Arthur Compton on low-voltage arcs, particularly the oscillatory phenomena arising in {{the diffusion of}} electrons against low-voltage fields. He continued {{this line of work}} after receipt of his Ph.D. on a National Research Council Fellowship at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) during the period 1925 to 1927.Max Born, Director of the Institute for Theoretical Physics at the Georg-August University of Göttingen and co-developer of the matrix mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics with Werner Heisenberg, came to Caltech in the winter of 1925 and gave a lecture on his work. Born’s lecture gave Eckart the impetus to investigate the possible general operator formalism for quantum mechanics. Working into early 1926, Eckart developed the formalism. When [...] Erwin Schrödinger’s first paper in the series of four on the wave mechanics formulation of quantum mechanics was published in January, Eckart soon realized that the matrix formulation and wave formulation of quantum mechanics were equivalent; he submitted his paper to the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America for publication. However, it was communicated on May 31, 1926, and Schrödinger’s paper on the equivalence was received on March 18, 1926, thus giving him credit for the realization.In 1927 Eckart received a Guggenheim Fellowship to do postdoctoral study and research with Arnold Sommerfeld at the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich, one of the three main centers for the development of quantum mechanics, the others being Göttingen under Born and the University of Copenhagen under Niels Bohr. Also at Munich simultaneous with Eckart were Rudolf Peierls, and two other Guggenheim Fellows, Edwin C. Kemble and William V. Houston. [...] In Munich, Eckart worked on the quantum mechanical behavior of simple oscillators using the Schrödinger equation and on operator calculus related to the matrix formulation of quantum mechanics.

5000|$|Houston {{began his}} college {{education}} in 1916 at Ohio State University (OSU) where {{he earned his}} baccalaureate degree in physics. He {{served in the military}} during 1918 and 1919. After teaching physics at the University of Dubuque for one year, he entered graduate studies at the University of Chicago and studied under Albert A. Michelson, who had won the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1907, and Robert Millikan who would win the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1923 for his measurement of the charge on the electron and for his work on the photoelectric effect. It was at this time that Houston began his experimental work on the fine structure of hydrogen. In 1922, he returned to Ohio State, where he was an instructor in physics and studied spectroscopy under A. D. Cole. Houston was granted his Ph.D. in 1925, after which he went to the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) on a National Research Fellowship, largely because Millikan had left Chicago for Caltech in 1922. At Caltech Houston continued his work in spectroscopy and making improvements in Fabry-Pérot interferometry. At Caltech, he taught a spectroscopy course out of Atombau und Spektrallinien, which became the “bible” of atomic theory for the new generation of physicists who developed atomic and quantum physics. In 1927 and 1928, Houston was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, which he used to go to Germany to do postgraduate study with Arnold Sommerfeld at the Ludwig Maximilians University of Munich and Werner Heisenberg at the University of Leipzig. Also studying with Sommerfeld concurrently with Houston were Carl Eckart, Edwin C. Kemble, and Rudolf Peierls. At that time, the winter semester of 1927, Sommerfeld, in his special lectures, treated the theory of electrons in metals for the first time. As a course of study, Sommerfeld suggested to Houston that he investigate the mean free path of electrons and its relationship to resistance in metals as a function of temperature. Sommerfeld showed Houston the proof of a paper soon be published on the subject of <b>Fermi</b> <b>statistics</b> applied to phenomena in metals. Houston’s work on the subject was published in a paper coauthored with Sommerfeld and Eckart. [...] After spending the winter semester of 1927 with Sommerfeld, Houston went to spend the spring semester of 1928 with Heisenberg in Leipzig. There, he studied the spin-orbit interaction in two-electron spectra. Houston was able to show the transition from Russell-Saunders coupling to jj-coupling in two-electron systems and its influence on the Zeeman effect. It was at this time that Houston formed a professional and personal friendship with Felix Bloch, who did pioneering work on the motion of electrons in periodic structures.|$|E
