5|$|Various {{plants are}} said to have apotropaic qualities, notably Mountain Ash. Henbane (<b>Hyoscyamus</b> niger) may have been used as a {{hallucinogen}} as long ago as the Neolithic period. This tradition has recently been taken up once again by New Agers.|$|E
25|$|Atropine {{is found}} in {{many members of the}} Solanaceae family. The most {{commonly}} found sources are Atropa belladonna, Datura innoxia, D. metel, and D. stramonium. Other sources include members of the Brugmansia and <b>Hyoscyamus</b> genera.|$|E
25|$|According to 2003 Forest Survey of India report, legally defined forest areas {{constitute}} 66.52% of {{the area}} of Himachal Pradesh. Vegetation in the state is dictated by elevation and precipitation. The state endows with a high diversity of medicinal and aromatic plants. Lahaul-Spiti region of the state, being a cold desert, supports unique plants of medicinal value including Ferula jaeschkeana, <b>Hyoscyamus</b> niger, Lancea tibetica, and Saussurea bracteata.|$|E
25|$|Potatoes contain toxic {{compounds}} {{known as}} glycoalkaloids, {{of which the}} most prevalent are solanine and chaconine. Solanine {{is also found in}} other plants in the family Solanaceae, which includes such plants as the deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna), henbane (<b>Hyoscyamus</b> niger) and tobacco (Nicotiana), as well as eggplant and tomato. These compounds, which protect the plant from its predators, are, in general, concentrated in its leaves, stems, sprouts, and fruits (in contrast to the roots). In a summary of several studies, the glycoalkaloid content was highest in flowers and sprouts and lowest in the tuber flesh (in order from highest to lowest content, generally: flowers, sprouts, leaves, skin, roots, berries, peel , stems, and tuber flesh).|$|E
25|$|One {{example is}} a grave in Fyrkat, Denmark {{which turned out to}} be the richest grave in the area. She had been buried in a wagon from which the wheels had been removed. She had been plainly clad in what was {{probably}} only a long dress. Around her toes, she had toe rings, which suggests that she was buried without shoes or only in sandals so that the rings showed. At her head, she had a Gotlandic buckle which may have been used as a box, and she also owned objects from Finland and Russia. At her feet, she had a box which contained her magic tools, comprising a pellet from an owl as well as small bones from birds and mammals, and in a pouch she had the seeds of <b>Hyoscyamus</b> niger ("henbane"). If such seeds are thrown into a fire, they produce a hallucinogenic smoke which causes a sense of flying. In the grave there was also a small silver amulet that represented a chair made from a stump. When such small silver chairs are discovered in graves, they always belong to a woman, and it is possible that they represented objects such as the platform where the vǫlva performed her rituals and Hlidskjalf from which Odin watched across the world.|$|E
500|$|Archigenes of Apamea {{describes}} {{use of a}} mouthwash made by boiling gallnuts and hallicacabum in vinegar, and {{a mixture}} of roasted earthworms, spikenard ointment, and crushed spider eggs. Pliny advises toothache sufferers to ask a frog {{to take away the}} pain by moonlight. Claudius' physician Scribonius Largus recommends [...] "fumigations made with the seeds of the <b>hyoscyamus</b> scattered on burning charcoal ... followed by rinsings of the mouth with hot water, in this way ... small worms are expelled." ...|$|E
500|$|The Dioscorides {{translator}} {{and editor}} Tess Anne Osbaldeston notes that [...] "For almost two millennia Dioscorides {{was regarded as}} the ultimate authority on plants and medicine", and that he [...] "achieved overwhelming commendation and approval because his writings addressed the many ills of mankind most usefully." [...] To illustrate this, she states that [...] "Dioscorides describes many valuable drugs including aconite, aloes, bitter apple, colchicum, henbane, and squill". The work mentions the painkillers willow (leading ultimately to aspirin, she writes), autumn crocus and opium, which however is also narcotic. Many other substances that Dioscorides describes remain in modern pharmacopoeias as [...] "minor drugs, diluents, flavouring agents, and emollients... ammoniacum, anise, cardamoms, catechu, cinnamon, colocynth, coriander, crocus, dill, fennel, galbanum, gentian, hemlock, <b>hyoscyamus,</b> lavender, linseed, mastic, male fern, marjoram, marshmallow, mezereon, mustard, myrrh, orris (iris), oak galls, olive oil, pennyroyal, pepper, peppermint, poppy, psyllium, rhubarb, rosemary, rue, saffron, sesame, squirting cucumber (elaterium), starch, stavesacre (delphinium), storax, stramonium, sugar, terebinth, thyme, white hellebore, white horehound, and couch grass — the last still used as a demulcent diuretic." [...] She notes that medicines such as wormwood, juniper, ginger, and calamine also remain in use, while [...] "Chinese and Indian physicians continue to use liquorice". She observes that the many drugs listed to reduce the spleen {{may be explained by}} the frequency of malaria in his time. Dioscorides lists drugs for women to cause abortion and to treat urinary tract infection; palliatives for toothache, such as colocynth, and others for intestinal pains; and treatments for skin and eye diseases. As well as these useful substances, she observes that [...] "A few superstitious practices are recorded in De Materia Medica," [...] such as using Echium as an amulet to ward off snakes, or Polemonia (Jacob's ladder) for scorpion stings.|$|E
2500|$|Throughout 1200 - 1500 A.D. in England, a potion called dwale {{was used}} as an anesthetic. This mixture {{contained}} bile, opium, lettuce, bryony, and hemlock. Surgeons roused them by rubbing vinegar and salt on their cheekbones. One can find records of dwale in numerous literary sources, including Shakespeare's Hamlet, and the John Keats poem [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". In the 13th century, we have the first prescription of the [...] "spongia soporifica"—a sponge soaked in the juices of unripe mulberry, flax, mandragora leaves, ivy, lettuce seeds, lapathum, and hemlock with <b>hyoscyamus.</b> After treatment and/or storage, the sponge could be heated and the vapors inhaled with anasthetic effect.|$|E

6000|$|January 11.--I got proof-sheets, {{in which}} it seems I have {{repeated}} a whole passage of history which had been told before. James is in an awful stew, and I cannot blame him; but then he should consider the <b>hyoscyamus</b> which I was taking, and the anxious botheration about the money-market. However, as Chaucer says:-- ...|$|E
60|$|Extract of Hyoscyamus.--Several {{leaves were}} placed, each in thirty minims of an {{infusion}} of 3 grs. of the extract sold by druggists to 1 oz. of water. One of them, after being immersed for 5 hrs. 15 m., was not inflected, and was then put into a solution (1 gr. to 1 oz.) of carbonate of ammonia; after 2 hrs. 40 m. it was found considerably inflected, and the glands much blackened. Four of the leaves, after being immersed for 2 hrs. 14 m., were placed in 120 minims of a solution (1 gr. to 20 oz.) of phosphate of ammonia; they had already become slightly inflected from the <b>hyoscyamus,</b> probably owing {{to the presence of}} some albuminous matter, as formerly explained, but the inflection immediately increased, and after 1 hr. was strongly pronounced; so that <b>hyoscyamus</b> does not act as a narcotic or poison.|$|E
6000|$|I may here {{add that}} {{one part of}} the extract of {{belladonna}} (procured from a druggist) was dissolved in 437 of water, and drops were placed on six leaves. Next day all six were somewhat inflected, and after 48 hrs. were completely re-expanded. It was not the included atropine which produced this effect, for I subsequently ascertained that it is quite powerless. I also procured some extract of <b>hyoscyamus</b> from three shops, and made infusions of the same strength as before. Of these three infusions, only one acted on some of the leaves, which were tried. Though druggists believe that all the albumen is precipitated in the preparation of these drugs, I cannot doubt that some is occasionally retained; and a trace would be sufficient to excite the more sensitive leaves of Drosera.

I {{do not wish}} to make any one uneasy about me, and I may have made light of the cold I caught a month since; but I cannot conceal from myself that I have much painful cough, an inclination to shortness of breath, and pain in the back and shoulders, especially after long reading or writing. I thought it right to speak to Mr. Downton, but people in high health can understand nothing short of a raging fever; however, at last he called in the parish surgeon, a stupid, ignorant fellow, who understands my case no more than his horse, and treats me with <b>hyoscyamus,</b> {{as if it were a}} mere throat-cough. I thought it my duty to speak openly, since, though I am quite aware that circumstances make little difference in constitutional cases, I know you and dear Mrs. Kendal will wish that all possible means should be used, and I think it--' ...|$|E
60|$|On {{my arrival}} I found the villagers in a meadow, all squatted cross-legged in a circle, smoking their brass and iron pipes, {{drinking}} tea, {{and listening to}} {{a letter from the}} Rajah, concerning their treatment of me. Whilst my men were pitching my tent, I gathered forty plants new to me, all of Tartarian types.* [More Siberian plants appeared, as Astragali, Chenopodium, Artemisia, some grasses, new kinds of Pedicularis, Delphinium, and some small Orchids. Three species of Parnassia and six primroses made the turf gay, mixed with saxifrages, Androsace and Campanula. By the cottages was abundance of shepherd's-purse, Lepidium, and balsams, with dock, Galeopsis, and Cuscuta. Several low dwarf species of honeysuckle formed stunted bushes like heather; and Anisodus, a curious plant allied to <b>Hyoscyamus,</b> whose leaves are greedily eaten by yaks, was very common.] Wheat or barley I was assured had been cultivated at Tungu when it was possessed by Tibetans, and inhabited by a frontier guard, but I saw no appearance of any cultivation. The fact is an important one, as barley requires a mean summer temperature of 48 degrees to come to maturity. According to my observations, the mean temperature of Tungu in July is upwards of 50 degrees, and, by calculation, that of the three summer months, June, July, and August, should be about 46.5 degrees. As, however, I do not know whether these cerealia were grown as productive crops, much stress cannot be laid upon the fact of their having been cultivated, for in a great many parts of Tibet the barley is annually cut green for fodder.|$|E
60|$|Concluding Remarks on the Effects of the {{foregoing}} Agents.--As the glands, when excited, transmit some influence to the surrounding tentacles, causing them to bend and their glands to pour forth an increased amount of modified secretion, I was anxious to ascertain whether the leaves included any element having the nature of nerve-tissue, which, though not continuous, served as the channel of transmission. This led me to try the several alkaloids and other substances which are known to exert a powerful influence on the nervous system of animals; I was at first encouraged in my trials by finding that strychnine, digitaline, and nicotine, which all act on the nervous system, were poisonous to Drosera, and caused {{a certain amount of}} inflection. Hydrocyanic acid, again, which is so deadly a poison to animals, caused rapid movement of the tentacles. But as several innocuous acids, though much diluted, such as benzoic, acetic, &c., as well as some essential oils, are extremely poisonous to Drosera, and quickly cause strong inflection, it seems probable that strychnine, nicotine, digitaline, and hydrocyanic acid, excite inflection by acting on elements in no way analogous to the nerve-cells of animals. If elements of this latter nature had been present in the leaves, it might have been expected that morphia, <b>hyoscyamus,</b> atropine, veratrine, colchicine, curare, and diluted alcohol would have produced some marked effect; whereas [page 224] these substances are not poisonous and have no power, or only a very slight one, of inducing inflection. It should, however, be observed that curare, colchicine, and veratrine are muscle-poisons--that is, act on nerves having some special relation with the muscles, and, therefore, could not be expected to act on Drosera. The poison of the cobra is most deadly to animals, by paralysing their nerve-centres,* yet is not in the least so to Drosera, though quickly causing strong inflection.|$|E

50|$|<b>Hyoscyamus</b> albus, {{the white}} henbane or yellow henbane, is {{a plant in}} the family of Solanaceae. It is found in Southern Europe.|$|E
50|$|In 1879, Fletcher's Field was {{identified}} by the Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain as a notable source of <b>Hyoscyamus</b> niger, a psychoactive plant.|$|E
50|$|The larvae feed on <b>Hyoscyamus</b> {{species and}} Solanum dulcamara. They are pale greenish grey, with dull reddish dorsal, subdorsal, and lateral lines and a {{yellowish}} brown head.|$|E
50|$|The genus name Physochlaina {{was first}} {{published}} in 1838 by Scottish botanist George Don (great-uncle of Monty Don) on page 470 of volume IV of his four-volume work A General System of Gardening and Botany, often referred to as Gen. Hist. (an abbreviation of the alternative title A General History of the Dichlamydeous Plants) and written between 1832 and 1838. He included in his new genus the two species hitherto known as <b>Hyoscyamus</b> physaloides L. and <b>Hyoscyamus</b> orientalis M. Bieb. - the latter published by Baron Friedrich August Marschall von Bieberstein his Flora taurico-caucasica in 1808.|$|E
50|$|Scopolia carniolica {{was first}} {{described}} by the botanist Carl Linnaeus and named in honour of the physician Giovanni Antonio Scopoli as <b>Hyoscyamus</b> scopolia. Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin classified it to the genus Scopolia.|$|E
50|$|In 1881, {{members of}} a French railway {{surveying}} expedition crossing Tuareg territory in North Africa ate dried dates that tribesmen had apparently deliberately contaminated with Egyptian henbane (<b>Hyoscyamus</b> muticus, or H. falezlez), to devastating effect.|$|E
50|$|Atropine {{is found}} in {{many members of the}} Solanaceae family. The most {{commonly}} found sources are Atropa belladonna, Datura innoxia, D. metel, and D. stramonium. Other sources include members of the Brugmansia and <b>Hyoscyamus</b> genera.|$|E
50|$|Larva reddish grey or ochreous,dotted with white; dorsal and subdorsal lines dark; spiracular line white; on {{flowers of}} various plants.The larvae feed {{on a variety}} of plants,including Ononis, Calendula, Senecio viscosus ,Tagetes, <b>Hyoscyamus,</b> Atropa {{belladonna}} and Atropa baetica.|$|E
5000|$|According to Josephus, the head-dress of the Jewish High Priests' {{was modeled}} upon the capsule of the <b>Hyoscyamus</b> flower, {{which he calls}} [...] "Saccharus". This Greek word for sugar stems from the Hebrew root that means [...] "intoxicating".|$|E
50|$|Various {{plants are}} said to have apotropaic qualities, notably Mountain Ash. Henbane (<b>Hyoscyamus</b> niger) may have been used as a {{hallucinogen}} as long ago as the Neolithic period. This tradition has recently been taken up once again by New Agers.|$|E
50|$|Grooved ware pots {{excavated}} at Balfarg in Fife {{have been}} chemically analysed {{to determine their}} contents. It appears {{that some of the}} vessels there may have been used to hold black henbane (<b>Hyoscyamus</b> niger) which is a poison and a powerful hallucinogen.|$|E
50|$|This {{apparent}} misnomer is {{an artifact}} of the plant's having initially been placed in the henbane genus <b>Hyoscyamus</b> as H. orientalis before {{the creation of the}} genus Physochlaina and the discovery and naming of its (Physochlaina 's) species of predominantly Chinese provenance.|$|E
