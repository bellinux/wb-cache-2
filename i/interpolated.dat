5|$|R.C. Hazra {{suggests}} that the Mudgala Purana is older than the Ganesha Purana, which he dates between 1100 and 1400. However, Phyllis Granoff finds problems with this relative dating and concludes that the Mudgala Purana {{was the last of}} the philosophical texts concerned with Ganesha. She bases her reasoning on the fact that, among other internal evidence, the Mudgala Purana specifically mentions the Ganesha Purana as one of the four Puranas (the Brahma, the Brahmanda, the Ganesha, and the Mudgala Puranas) which deal at length with Ganesha. While the kernel of the text must be old, it was <b>interpolated</b> until the 17th and 18th centuries as the worship of Ganapati became more important in certain regions.

Scholars have also wondered about the masque in Act 4, which some think was an <b>interpolated</b> afterthought, possibly added for the wedding of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick V in 1613.

5|$|In {{the field}} of {{statistics}} and applied probability, John Graunt published Natural and Political Observations Made upon the Bills of Mortality also in 1662, initiating the discipline of demography. This work, among other things, gave a statistical estimate {{of the population of}} London, produced the first life table, gave probabilities of survival of different age groups, examined the different causes of death, noting that the annual rate of suicide and accident is constant, and commented on the level and stability of sex ratio. The usefulness and interpretation of Graunt's tables were discussed in a series of correspondences by brothers Ludwig and Christiaan Huygens in 1667, where they realized the difference between mean and median estimates and Christian even <b>interpolated</b> Graunt's life table by a smooth curve, creating the first continuous probability distribution; but their correspondences were not published. Later, Johan de Witt, the then prime minister of the Dutch Republic, published similar material in his 1671 work Waerdye van Lyf-Renten (A Treatise on Life Annuities), which used statistical concepts to determine life expectancy for practical political purposes; a demonstration of the fact that this sapling branch of mathematics had significant pragmatic applications. De Witt's work was not widely distributed beyond the Dutch Republic, perhaps due to his fall from power and execution by mob in 1672. Apart from the practical contributions of these two work, they also exposed a fundamental idea that probability can be assigned to events that do not have inherent physical symmetry, such as the chances of dying at certain age, unlike say the rolling of a dice or flipping of a coin, simply by counting the frequency of occurrence. Thus probability could be more than mere combinatorics.|$|E

Image interpolation is an important image magnification tool, but the magnified image has not been changed by the traditional image interpolation methods even if the magnified image is not satisfaction. Basically, the <b>interpolating</b> surface is determined uniquely for the given <b>interpolating</b> data. Namely the <b>interpolating</b> surface (magnified image) is fixed when the <b>interpolating</b> data (gray value of original image) is given. If the magnified image needs to be enhanced, another enhancement method must be chosen after image magnifying. The image magnification and enhancement are separated.

A bivariate rational interpolation with parameters {{is used in the}} algorithm. The value of the <b>interpolating</b> function at any point in the <b>interpolating</b> region can be modified under the condition that the <b>interpolating</b> data are not changed by selecting the suitable parameters.
