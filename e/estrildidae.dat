25|$|The Gouldian finch was {{described}} by British ornithological artist John Gould in 1844 and named after his wife Elizabeth. It is also known in America as the rainbow finch, Gould's finch, or the Lady Gouldian finch (although Mrs. Gould did not hold the title lady). In Australia, it is predominantly called the Gouldian finch. It {{is a member of}} the weaver-finch family <b>Estrildidae,</b> which is sometimes considered a subfamily of Passeridae.|$|E
25|$|Gapes of {{juvenile}} altricial birds are often brightly coloured, sometimes with contrasting spots or other patterns, {{and these are}} believed to be an indication of their health, fitness and competitive ability. Based on this, the parents decide how to distribute food among the chicks in the nest. Some species, especially in the families Viduidae and <b>Estrildidae,</b> have bright spots on the gape known as gape tubercles or gape papillae. These nodular spots are conspicuous even in low light. A study examining the nestling gapes of eight passerine species found that the gapes were conspicuous in the ultraviolet spectrum (visible to birds but not to humans). Parents may, however, not rely solely on the gape coloration, and other factors influencing their decision remain unknown.|$|E

50|$|The estrildid finches {{are small}} {{passerine}} birds of the Old World tropics and Australasia. They {{can be classified}} as the family <b>Estrildidae</b> (waxbills, munias, and allies), or as a subfamily within the family Passeridae, which strictly defined comprises the Old World sparrows.|$|E
50|$|Its closest {{relatives}} {{are thought to}} be the indigobirds and whydahs of the genus Vidua. These birds are now usually considered to form a family, Viduidae. Previously they were treated as a subfamily, Viduinae, within either the estrildid finch family, <b>Estrildidae,</b> or the weaver family, Ploceidae.|$|E
50|$|The masked finch (Poephila personata) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird in the estrildid finch family, <b>Estrildidae.</b> It is {{a common}} resident of dry savannah across northern Australia, from the Kimberley, across the Top End, the Gulf country and {{the southern part of}} Cape York Peninsula, as far east as Chillagoe, but always near water.|$|E
50|$|Jameson's antpecker (Parmoptila jamesoni) is a {{songbird}} species {{found in}} central Africa. Like all antpeckers, it is tentatively {{placed in the}} estrildid finch family (<b>Estrildidae).</b> It has traditionally been included as a subspecies of P. rubrifrons (red-fronted antpecker) and the common name Jameson's antpecker was sometimes used for both taxa.

5000|$|Many {{birds in}} other {{families}} are also commonly called [...] "finches", including some {{species in the}} very similar-looking waxbills or estrildid finches (family <b>Estrildidae)</b> of the Old World tropics and Australia; several groups of the bunting and American sparrow family (Emberizidae); and the Darwin's finches of the Galapagos islands, now considered members of the tanager family (Thraupidae).|$|E
50|$|Parrotfinches are small, {{colourful}} passerine birds {{belonging to}} the genus Erythrura in the family <b>Estrildidae,</b> the estrildid finches. They occur from South-east Asia to New Guinea, northern Australia and many Pacific Islands. They inhabit forest, bamboo thickets and grassland and some {{can be found in}} man-made habitats such as farmland, parks and gardens. Several species are commonly kept as cagebirds.|$|E
50|$|The cream-bellied munia or cream-bellied mannikin (Lonchura pallidiventer) is a bird of {{the family}} <b>Estrildidae.</b> It was {{described}} as new to science by Restall (1996) but is considered a hybrid by van Balen (1998) and Dickinson (2003) and this treatment {{is followed by the}} BirdLife Taxonomic Working Group and it is not recognised by BirdLife International or the IOC. It is found only in Indonesia.|$|E
50|$|The Chad firefinch or Reichenow's firefinch (Lagonosticta umbrinodorsalis) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird {{belonging to}} the firefinch genus Lagonosticta in the estrildid finch family <b>Estrildidae.</b> It is restricted to a small area of Central Africa. It was formerly classified as a subspecies of Jameson's firefinch (L. rhodopareia) but is now often treated as a separate species. Its alternative name commemorates Anton Reichenow, the German ornithologist who described the species.|$|E
50|$|The Gouldian finch was {{described}} by British ornithological artist John Gould in 1844 and named after his wife Elizabeth. It is also known in America as the rainbow finch, Gould's finch, or the Lady Gouldian finch (although Mrs. Gould did not hold the title lady).

50|$|The pictorella mannikin or pictorella munia (Heteromunia pectoralis) is {{a species}} of bird in the family <b>Estrildidae.</b> It belongs to the {{monotypic}} genus Heteromunia. It is endemic to northern Australia, where its natural habitats are dry savannah and subtropical or tropical dry lowland grassland. In 2007, the International Union for the Conservation of Nature downgraded its assessment of the species from near threatened to least concern after large flocks of this species were found at several locations.|$|E
5000|$|Euodice is a genus of estrildid songbirds that is {{recognized}} by some authorities while some include {{it within the}} genus Lonchura where it is treated as a subgenus. [...] Its members are from the dry zones of Africa and India and are {{commonly referred to as}} silverbills. The African and Indian species were earlier considered conspecific because they can interbreed. They are phylogenetically distinct and form a clade that is basal to other relatives in <b>Estrildidae.</b>|$|E
50|$|The crimsonwings (Cryptospiza) are a genus {{of small}} {{passerine}} birds {{belonging to the}} estrildid finch family (<b>Estrildidae).</b> There are four species. They are found in parts of Africa, particularly the Albertine Rift; all four species occur there and two, Shelley's and dusky crimsonwings, are found nowhere else. They are secretive birds which mainly inhabit mountain forests with dense undergrowth. They usually forage {{on or near the}} ground, feeding mainly on seeds such as those of grasses and balsam.|$|E
50|$|Some {{authorities}} previously classified {{the related}} estrildid finches of the Old World tropics and Australasia {{as members of}} the Passeridae. Like sparrows, the estrildid finches are small, gregarious and often colonial seed-eaters with short, thick, but pointed bills. They are broadly similar in structure and habits, but tend to be very colourful and vary greatly in their plumage. The 2008 Christidis and Boles taxonomic scheme lists the estrildid finches as the separate family <b>Estrildidae,</b> leaving just the true sparrows in Passeridae.|$|E
50|$|Anatomically, {{the green}} hylia has {{similarities}} to sunbirds and warblers. Characteristics shared with sunbirds include a long hyloid with flattened epibranchial horns, a brush-tipped tongue and membrane-covered nostrils. Similarities to some warblers include very comparable colouring. The {{relationship between the}} genera Hylia and Phylloscopus (leaf warblers) has been examined but seems to have low empirical support. A sister relationship between Hylia and Aegithalidae (long tailed tits) was similarly poorly supported. Close relationships with Nectariniidae (sunbirds), <b>Estrildidae</b> (finches) and Meliphagidae (honeyeaters) have also been rejected.|$|E
50|$|The red avadavat, red munia or {{strawberry}} finch (Amandava amandava) is a sparrow-sized bird {{of the family}} <b>Estrildidae.</b> It {{is found in the}} open fields and grasslands of tropical Asia and is popular as a cage bird due to the colourful plumage of the males in their breeding season. It breeds in the Indian Subcontinent in the monsoon season. The species name of amandava and the common name of avadavat are derived from the city of Ahmedabad in Gujarat, India, from where these birds were exported into the pet trade in former times.|$|E
50|$|Sparrows are {{a family}} of small {{passerine}} birds, Passeridae. They are also known as true sparrows, or Old World sparrows, names also used for a particular genus of the family, Passer. They are distinct from both the American sparrows, in the family Emberizidae, and from a few other birds sharing their name, such as the Java sparrow of the family <b>Estrildidae.</b> Many species nest on buildings, and the house and Eurasian tree sparrows in particular inhabit cities in large numbers, so sparrows {{are among the most}} familiar of all wild birds. They are primarily seed-eaters, though they also consume small insects. Some species scavenge for food around cities and, like gulls or rock doves, will happily eat virtually anything in small quantities.|$|E
