40|$|The present licentiate thesis {{analyses}} {{developments in}} Swedish <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> during the interwar period, including both direct <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> and <b>marine</b> reinsurance. This {{is done in}} order to provide insights on how companies of a highly internationalised and vulnerable line of insurance were affected by and responded to new risks during a period of far-reaching international financial and economic crises. Finally, the consequences of new risks and strategies are assessed. This thesis argues that during the interwar period Swedish maritime trade and Swedish <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> greatly depended on each other for <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> cover and <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> premium incomes. The business results in Swedish <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> partly depended on the development of Swedish trade. These business results were also vulnerable to currency risks. Swedish marine insurers faced no similar trade or currency risks during the two decades preceding World War I, and accordingly the returns on Swedish <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> were lower during the interwar period than during the last two pre-war decades. These factors probably bore their most severe consequences during the early 1920 s when Swedish <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> on average induced losses to insurers. The remaining years of the period constituted a long-run recovery, and the Great Depression of the early 1930 s caused no difficulties of the same order. This thesis also indicates that interwar Swedish marine insurers responded to new risks by increasing the level of cession to reinsurers. Another response was to increase the level of differentiation among insurance lines. This thesis describes the consequences of new risks and strategies in interwar Swedish <b>marine</b> <b>insurance,</b> focusing {{on the development of the}} Swedish <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> market structure and on the business results of Swedish marine insurers. Though this market shrunk and grew excessively, the relative importance of stock and mutual insurers showed only minor fluctuations. The importance of specialised marine reinsurance companies, however, fluctuated greatly. Also, cooperation between interwar marine insurers and the formation of insurance groups set new trends of concentration for the future. Finally, even though Swedish <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> during some years induced losses the Swedish marine insurers never experienced true losses on their total businesses...|$|R

50|$|Lloyd's Coffee House was {{the first}} <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> market. It became the meeting place for parties in the {{shipping}} industry wishing to insure cargoes and ships, and those willing to underwrite such ventures. These informal beginnings led {{to the establishment of}} the insurance market Lloyd's of London and several related shipping and insurance businesses. The participating members of the insurance arrangement eventually formed a committee and moved to the Royal Exchange on Cornhill as the Society of Lloyd's. The establishment of insurance companies, a developing infrastructure of specialists (such as shipbrokers, admiralty lawyers, bankers, surveyors, loss adjusters, general average adjusters, et al.), and the growth of the British Empire gave English law a prominence in this area which it largely maintains and forms the basis of almost all modern practice. Lord Mansfield, Lord Chief Justice in the mid-eighteenth century, began the merging of law merchant and common law principles. The growth of the London insurance market led to the standardization of policies and judicial precedent further developed <b>marine</b> <b>insurance</b> law. In 1906 the <b>Marine</b> <b>Insurance</b> Act codified the previous common law; it is both an extremely thorough and concise piece of work. Although the title of the Act refers to <b>marine</b> <b>insurance,</b> the general principles have been applied to all non-life insurance. In the 19th century, Lloyd's and the Institute of London Underwriters (a grouping of London company insurers) developed between them standardized clauses for the use of <b>marine</b> <b>insurance,</b> and these have been maintained since. These are known as the Institute Clauses because the Institute covered the cost of their publication. Out of <b>marine</b> <b>insurance,</b> grew non-marine <b>insurance</b> and reinsurance. <b>Marine</b> <b>insurance</b> traditionally formed the majority of business underwritten at Lloyd's. Nowadays, <b>Marine</b> <b>insurance</b> is often grouped with Aviation and Transit (cargo) risks, and in this form is known by the acronym 'MAT'.|$|R
