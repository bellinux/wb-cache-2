25|$|He {{subsequently}} played liberal working-class Lancastrian barrister James Kavanagh in Kavanagh QC (1995–99, and {{a special}} in 2001). Thaw also tried his hand at comedy with two sitcoms—Thick as Thieves (London Weekend/ITV, 1974) with Bob Hoskins and <b>Home</b> <b>to</b> <b>Roost</b> (Yorkshire/ITV, 1985–90). Thaw is best known in America for the Morse series, {{as well as the}} BBC series A Year in Provence (1993) with Lindsay Duncan.|$|E
25|$|Jeremiah Wright {{is a man}} who {{less than}} a week after 9/11 gave a sermon that sadistically rejoiced how America's {{chickens}} had come <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>roost...</b> The fact is, Barack Obama opted to remain in this minister's company for more than six years after that sermon until partially distancing himself just last week in the heat of a presidential race... What the analysts who are gushing over Obama's sentiments regarding race relations are missing is not only did Obama fail to accomplish the mission he needed to, he didn't even really try. He made no attempt to explain his relationship with Wright and why he hung around a man who habitually offered such hateful rhetoric. Obama instead offered a non-sequitur on race relations.|$|E

These, he said, were instances of other 'chickens coming home to roost'." [...] The remarks prompted a widespread public outcry. The Nation of Islam, which had sent a message of condolence to the Kennedy family and ordered its ministers not to comment on the assassination, publicly censured their former shining star. MalcolmX retained his post and rank as minister, but was prohibited from public speaking for 90 days.|$|E

"July 2011 "Survival and dispersal during the juvenile life stage are critical to population connectivity and persistence, but the post-fledging period is the least studied stage of the avian life cycle. We intensively radio-tracked Red-bellied Woodpeckers (Melanerpes carolinus) from fledging to dispersal to identify patterns of prospecting, test for landscape effects on individual movement, and investigate factors with the potential to affect juvenile survival. Juveniles used a centrally-based foray prospecting strategy previously only associated with cooperatively breeding birds. Woodpeckers repeatedly forayed between returns <b>to</b> the natal <b>home</b> range <b>to</b> <b>roost,</b> and foray direction predicted eventual dispersal settlement direction. Prospecting individuals traveled along paths containing higher forest cover than was randomly available in the surrounding area. Juvenile mortality declined with age and no birds died during prospecting or dispersal stages, which suggests that dispersal is not costly in this species. We provide evidence of juvenile birds making repeated exploratory movements to inform decisions about dispersal prior to permanent departure from the natal area. In addition, we demonstrate the value of landscape habitat connectivity to a dispersing resident forest bird...|$|R

2500|$|When Denzel Washington {{took the}} role of Malcolm X in the play, When the Chickens Come <b>Home</b> <b>to</b> <b>Roost,</b> which dealt with the {{relationship}} between Malcolm X and Elijah Muhammad, he admitted he knew little about Malcolm X and had not yet read The Autobiography of Malcolm X. [...] Washington prepared by reading books and articles by and about Malcolm X and went over hours of tape and film footage of speeches. [...] The play opened in 1981 and earned Washington a warm review by Frank Rich, {{who was at the}} time the chief theater critic of The New York Times. Upon being cast in the film, he interviewed people who knew Malcolm X, among them Betty Shabazz and two of his brothers. Although they had different upbringings, Washington tried to focus on what he had in common with his character: Washington was close to Malcolm X's age when he was assassinated, both men were from large families, both of their fathers were ministers, and both were raised primarily by their mothers.|$|E

50|$|The lesser {{white-lined bat}} is {{indigenous}} to northern South American {{as well as}} parts of Central America. The bat is found in heavily forested areas and typically roosts in trees. The lesser white-lined bat prefers more open areas <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> and while they prefer trees they have also been known <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> inside buildings. They don't {{seem to have a}} preference of tree type but gravitate more towards areas with heavy canopy cover. They don't need <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> near a body or water.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the nature}} park there are ponors, karst springs, {{subsidence}} lakes and dolines {{as well as}} steep gypsum cliffs. Thanks to the many caves, numerous species of bat - including the barbastelle - live in the beech woods, where they find suitable places <b>to</b> <b>roost.</b> It is also <b>home</b> <b>to</b> the wildcat and lynx. Areas of dry grassland with orchids are the remnants of old meadows and pastures on the karst surfaces.|$|R
2500|$|According to the London Sunday Times on March 20, 2005, {{despite their}} {{cultural}} differences:Riza, an Arab feminist who confounds portrayals of Wolfowitz {{as a leader}} of a [...] "Zionist conspiracy" [...] of Jewish neoconservatives in Washington ... works as the bank's senior gender co-ordinator for the Middle East and north Africa ... not only shares Wolfowitz's passion for spreading democracy in the Arab world, but is said to have reinforced his determination to remove Saddam Hussein's oppressive regime.The relationship created further controversy over Wolfowitz's nomination to head the World Bank, because the bank's ethics rules preclude sexual relationships between a manager and a staff member serving under that manager, even if one reports to the other only indirectly through a chain of supervision. Sharon Churcher and Annette Witheridge, in The Daily Mail, quote one World Bank employee's statement that [...] "Unless Riza gives up her job, this will be an impossible conflict of interest"; the observation of [...] "a Washington insider": [...] "His womanizing has come <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> ... Paul was a foreign policy hawk long before he met Shaha, but it doesn't look good to be accused of being under the thumb of your mistress"; and Wolfowitz's response: [...] "If a personal relationship presents a potential conflict of interest, I will comply with Bank policies to resolve the issue." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{earliest}} pre-revolution articles to link the death of Saeed to an imminent nationwide explosion came from Saeed's neighbor, Egyptian-Australian Amro Ali. In an opinion piece titled , Ali writes an intimate portrayal of Saeed and the Alexandria context, {{as well as the}} ramifications of his death for the regime. Ali states [...] "Saeed's tragedy is Egypt's tragedy. A young man, neither a political activist nor religious radical, but an ordinary Egyptian whose accused actions could not in any way warrant his lynching. Saeed was someone's son, someone's brother, someone's friend, someone's neighbour, someone's customer, and if not for what had happened, someone's future. Saeed was, in the local vernacular, a son of Cleopatra [...] Yet the system that was supposed to protect him and give him his rights, took away those rights by taking away his life... It is one extra nail in the coffin of the ever-widening gulf between the ruler and ruled... What the Egyptian establishment maybe forgetting... is that pigeons come <b>home</b> <b>to</b> <b>roost</b> more than once." [...] Ali would later publish a personal and analytical account in Jadaliyya on the second anniversary of Saeed's death: [...] As well as analysing what really happened to Saeed, Ali also examines the dynamics of how Saeed was rapidly mythologized and the ramifications it has produced in Egyptian society.|$|E
