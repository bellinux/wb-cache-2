5|$|In a blast <b>furnace</b> fuel (coke), ores, and flux (limestone) are {{continuously}} supplied {{through the}} top of the <b>furnace,</b> while a hot blast of air (sometimes with oxygen enrichment) is blown into the lower section of the <b>furnace</b> through a series of pipes called tuyeres, so that the chemical reactions take place throughout the <b>furnace</b> as the material falls downward. The end products are usually molten metal and slag phases tapped from the bottom, and flue gases exiting from {{the top of the}} <b>furnace.</b> The downward flow of the ore and flux in contact with an upflow of hot, carbon monoxide-rich combustion gases is a countercurrent exchange and chemical reaction process.|$|E
5|$|Nittany <b>Furnace,</b> known earlier as Valentine <b>Furnace,</b> was a {{hot blast}} iron <b>furnace</b> located in Spring Township, Centre County, Pennsylvania, United States. Placed in {{operation}} in 1888 {{on the site of}} an older <b>furnace,</b> it was an important feature of Bellefonte economic life until it closed in 1911, no longer able to compete with more modern steel producers.|$|E
5|$|The <b>furnace</b> {{continued}} in anemic health until the Panic of 1907. As {{a result of}} that crisis, it was idle for most of 1908 and half of 1909. It was operated in 1910 largely to use up its inventory of local ore, and went out of blast on January 23, 1911. Bellefonte <b>Furnace</b> had closed in December. The shutdown of the furnaces was to be temporary, but both facilities were no longer remunerative to operate, and no buyer willing to operate them could be found. Leftover pig iron and <b>furnace</b> slag from Nittany <b>Furnace</b> were shipped out over the Nittany Valley RR in 1912–1913. The <b>furnace</b> and railroad were put up for sale in 1914 and the <b>furnace</b> demolished. The <b>furnace</b> site was later used by the Titan Metal and Manufacturing Company.|$|E

5|$|Cupola furnace: American {{anthropologist}} Vincent C. Pigott of the University of Pennsylvania {{states that}} the cupola <b>furnace</b> existed in China at least by the Warring States period (403–221 BC), while Donald B. Wagner writes that some iron ore melted in the blast <b>furnace</b> may have been cast directly into molds, but most, if not all, iron smelted in the blast <b>furnace</b> during the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) was remelted in a cupola furnace; it was designed so that a cold blast injected at the bottom traveled through tuyere pipes across the top where the charge (i.e. of charcoal and scrap or pig iron) was dumped, the air becoming a hot blast before reaching {{the bottom of the}} <b>furnace</b> where the iron was melted and then drained into appropriate molds for casting.|$|E

5|$|Once again, Gephart {{appeared}} on the scene to save the <b>furnace.</b> With the backing of Philadelphia and New York investors, he formed the Nittany Iron Company, which bought and rehabilitated the <b>furnace,</b> returning it to blast on June 5, 1902, under Frank H. Clemson (former chief of mining at Gephart's Bellefonte <b>Furnace</b> Company). Other organizers included Lorenzo Terbal Munson, Gephart's brother-in-law (who was associated with Bellefonte Glass and the Bellefonte Iron and Nail Works), Archer Brown, and William Sampson. However, prosperity did not return to the ironmaking business. The <b>furnace</b> was idle for two months in 1904. As steel production in open hearth furnaces became increasingly commonplace (a method better suited for iron made from Lake Superior ore, while Bessemer converters functioned best with Centre County ore), Nittany <b>Furnace</b> found it increasingly difficult to operate at a profit. The death of Gephart on February 14, 1905 also dealt a blow to the company, which thereafter shared management with the Bellefonte <b>Furnace</b> Company.|$|E

Therefore, it is necessary to optimize their work process. The thesis deals with energetic problems of high power electric <b>furnaces.</b> The first part provides a theoretical overview of types of electric <b>furnaces,</b> their types, properties and possibility of connecting to the electricity grid. For this work were selected resistance <b>furnaces,</b> induction <b>furnaces</b> and arc <b>furnaces.</b> The second part analyzes the problem of correcting power factor cos and the problem of unbalanced electricity consumption. For both these problems are given the possibilities for removing or reducing the negative characteristics of these phenomena.

40|$|Based on {{thermal value}} theory, {{the aim of}} this paper is to deduce the {{theoretical}} formulas for evaluating the energy ef-fective utilization degree in technological pyrological processes exemplified by metallurgical heating <b>furnaces.</b> Heat transfer models for continuous heating <b>furnaces,</b> batch-type heating <b>furnaces,</b> and regenerative heating <b>furnaces</b> are es-tablished, respectively. By analyzing the movement path of injected infinitesimal heat attached on steel or gas, thermal value equations of continuous, batch-type, and regenerative heating <b>furnaces</b> are derived. Then the influences of such factors as hot charging, gas preheating and intake time of heat on energy effective utilization degree are discussed by thermal value equations. The results show that thermal value rises with hot charging and air preheating for continuous heating <b>furnaces,</b> with shorter intake time when heat is attached on steel or longer intake time when heat is attached on gas for batch-type heating <b>furnaces</b> and that with more heat supply at early heating stage or less at late stage for regen-erative heating <b>furnaces...</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1936 Washington Dillon's son, P.W. Dillon, {{installed}} two electric <b>furnaces</b> {{and rolling}} {{machines in the}} barbed wire factory {{in order to make}} low carbon steel. Two years later the company became known as Northwestern Steel and Wire. The systems and <b>furnaces</b> were successively upgraded in the ensuing years. During World War II, to keep up with escalating demand, two 50 ton electric <b>furnaces</b> were installed. By 1950 150 ton <b>furnaces</b> were in use. Throughout the years, as production increased, larger <b>furnaces</b> became the norm.|$|R
5|$|The {{preliminaries}} to the furnace's construction {{began in}} 1885, when Valentine and Thomas, an old ironmaking firm of Bellefonte, {{decided to sell}} off its properties. These then consisted of Bellefonte Forge, on Logan Branch just south of Bellefonte, and Bellefonte <b>Furnace,</b> a cold blast charcoal iron <b>furnace</b> lying about a mile south of the town, also on Logan Branch, as well as holdings in local iron ore mines. Both plants were served by the Bellefonte, Nittany and Lemont Railroad, {{a subsidiary of the}} PRR. The ironworks and ore lands were bought on August 2, 1886, for $400,000, by the Valentine Ore Land Association, whose principals organized the Centre Iron Company to erect a new iron <b>furnace</b> on the site of Bellefonte <b>Furnace,</b> which was to be torn down. A $600,000 mortgage was immediately raised on the properties, to supply the purchase money and funds for rebuilding the <b>furnace.</b> The leaders of the company included Edmund Blanchard, W. M. Stewart, and B. K. Jamison, a Philadelphia banker. The plant was built in 1887, and the Nittany Valley Railroad was built to supply it with ore. It became necessary to raise additional funds, and in 1887, the Pennsylvania Railroad purchased $75,000 worth of bonds in exchange for exclusive rights to rail traffic to and from the <b>furnace.</b> The first load of ore was delivered by the Nittany Valley on February 28, 1888, and the <b>furnace</b> went into blast on March 4, 1888. The company was originally headed by Jamison, but by 1890, James B. Coryell was president and Jamison vice-president. At this time, the <b>furnace</b> had one 70-foot (21-meter) stack and three hot-blast stoves, with a capacity of 30,000tons (27,200tonnes) of iron per year. Ore was supplied from local hematite deposits, and the <b>furnace</b> was fuelled by Connellsville coke. In the same year, however, the failure of Jamison's bank precipitated the closure of the <b>furnace</b> by the sheriff on November 15, 1890. It was subsequently sold under foreclosure.|$|E
5|$|The second-oldest mill {{in what is}} now Columbia County {{was built}} in a gorge on Roaring Creek, near its mouth, in the 1780s. This mill was known as the Cleaver Mill. A second mill, which was similar to the first, was later {{constructed}} at the site. John Hauch constructed a <b>furnace</b> on the creek in 1816. It was the first <b>furnace</b> in the area. The first iron <b>furnace</b> in Montour County was built near the creek's mouth in 1839 or 1840. The <b>furnace</b> was known as the Roaring Creek Anthracite Water Power <b>Furnace.</b> It was altered in 1854. In 1856, the <b>furnace</b> produced 2350 tons of iron from ore on Montour Ridge, despite low water. The only post office in Mayberry Township up to 1915 was built {{at the mouth of the}} creek in 1895. It was known as Howelsville, after W.B. Howell, its first postmaster.|$|E
5|$|The slag melts in {{the heat}} of the <b>furnace.</b> In the bottom of the <b>furnace,</b> the molten slag floats on top of the denser molten iron, and {{apertures}} in the side of the <b>furnace</b> are opened to run off the iron and the slag separately.

50|$|The initial melting of the {{material}} to be smelted is usually {{referred to as the}} smelting or matte smelting stage. It can be undertaken in a variety of <b>furnaces,</b> including the largely obsolete blast <b>furnaces</b> and reverberatory <b>furnaces,</b> as well as flash <b>furnaces,</b> Isasmelt <b>furnaces,</b> etc. The product of this smelting stage is a mixture of copper, iron and sulfur that is enriched in copper, and which is called matte or copper matte.

5|$|While {{acting as}} {{administrator}} of Nanyang in 31 CE, Du Shi (d. 38 CE) invented a water-powered reciprocator which worked the bellows {{of the blast}} <b>furnace</b> and cupola <b>furnace</b> in smelting iron; before this invention, intensive manual labor was required to work the bellows.|$|E
5|$|A blast <b>furnace</b> {{converts}} {{raw iron}} ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola <b>furnace</b> to produce cast iron. The earliest specimens of cast iron found in China date to the 5th century BC during the late Spring and Autumn period, yet the oldest discovered blast furnaces date to the 3rd century BCE and the majority date to the period after Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE) established a government monopoly over the iron industry in 117 BCE (most of the discovered iron works sites built before this date were merely foundries which recast iron that had been smelt elsewhere). Iron ore smelted in blast furnaces during the Han was rarely if ever cast directly into permanent molds; instead, the pig iron scraps were remelted in the cupola <b>furnace</b> to make cast iron. Cupola furnaces utilized a cold blast traveling through tuyere pipes from the bottom and over the top where the charge of charcoal and pig iron was introduced. The air traveling through the tuyere pipes thus became a hot blast once it reached {{the bottom of the}} <b>furnace.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to the Holy Land Handicraft Cooperative Society, the blowing {{technique}} employed is {{the same}} as was used by the ancient Phoenicians, though archaeologists and historians of glass agree that glassblowing was not common until the last few centuries BCE.

It is returned to the <b>furnace</b> and reshaped by the same process before being detached from the pipe and placed into a cooling chamber.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we will discuss}} {{some of the early}} {{pioneering}} work {{as well as some of}} our more recent research. The Albany Research Center (ARC) has been involved with the melting and processing of metals since it was established in 1942. In the early days, hardly anything was known about melting refractory or reactive metals and as such, virtually everything had to be developed in-house. Besides the more common induction heated air-melt <b>furnaces,</b> ARC has built and/or utilized a wide variety of <b>furnaces</b> including vacuum arc remelt ingot and casting <b>furnaces,</b> cold wall induction <b>furnaces,</b> electric arc <b>furnaces,</b> cupola <b>furnaces</b> and reverberatory <b>furnaces.</b> The melt size of these <b>furnaces</b> range from several grams to a ton or more. We have used these <b>furnaces</b> to formulate custom alloys for wrought applications as well as for such casting techniques as spin casting, investment casting and lost foam casting among many. Two early spin-off industrializations were Wah Chang (wrought zirconium alloys for military and commercial nuclear applications) and Oremet (both wrought and cast Ti). Both of these companies are now part of the ATI Allegheny Ludlum Corporation...|$|R

5|$|Coke iron was {{initially}} only used for foundry work, making pots and other cast iron goods. Foundry work {{was a minor}} branch of the industry, but Darby's son built a new <b>furnace</b> at nearby Horsehay, and began to supply the owners of finery forges with coke pig iron {{for the production of}} bar iron. Coke pig iron was by this time cheaper to produce than charcoal pig iron. The use of a coal-derived fuel in the iron industry was a key factor in the British Industrial Revolution. Darby's original blast <b>furnace</b> has been archaeologically excavated and can be seen in situ at Coalbrookdale, part of the Ironbridge Gorge Museums. Cast iron from the <b>furnace</b> was used to make girders for the world's first iron bridge in 1779. The Iron Bridge crosses the River Severn at Coalbrookdale and remains in use for pedestrians.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that blast furnaces, that convert raw iron ore into pig iron, {{which can be}} remelted in a cupola <b>furnace</b> to produce cast iron {{by means of a}} cold blast and hot blast, were operational in China by the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC). The bloomery was nonexistent in ancient China; however, the Han-era Chinese produced wrought iron by injecting excess oxygen into a <b>furnace</b> and causing decarburization. Cast iron and pig iron could be converted into wrought iron and steel using a fining process.|$|E
