25|$|I {{was very}} much {{surprised}} when Mill informed {{me that he had}} not read a line of Hegel, either in the original or in translation, and regarded the entire Hegelian philosophy as sterile and empty sophistry. I mentally confronted this with the opinion of the man at the Copenhagen University who knew the history of philosophy best, my teacher, Hans Brochner, who knew, so to speak, nothing of contemporary English and French philosophy, and did not think them worth studying. I {{came to the conclusion that}} <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> task for one who understood the thinkers of the two directions, who did not mutually understand one another.

500|$|In January 1930, Tracy was {{approached}} {{about a new}} play called The Last Mile. Looking to cast the lead role of a murderer on death row, producer Herman Shumlin met with Tracy, and later recounted: [...] "beneath the surface, <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> man of passion, violence, sensitivity and desperation: no ordinary man, and just the man for the part." [...] The Last Mile opened on Broadway in February, where Tracy's performance was met by a standing ovation that lasted 14 curtain calls. The Commonweal described him as [...] "one of our best and most versatile young actors". The play was a hit with critics, and ran for 289 performances.|$|E
500|$|Some in {{the feminist}} {{movement}} saw Plath as speaking for their experience, as a [...] "symbol of blighted female genius." [...] Writer Honor Moore describes Ariel as marking {{the beginning of a}} movement, Plath suddenly visible as [...] "a woman on paper", certain and audacious. Moore says: [...] "When Sylvia Plath’s Ariel was published in the United States in 1966, American women noticed. Not only women who ordinarily read poems, but housewives and mothers whose ambitions had awakened [...] <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> woman, superbly trained in her craft, whose final poems uncompromisingly charted female rage, ambivalence, and grief, in a voice with which many women identified." ...|$|E
500|$|The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold {{even more}} unsuccessfully than his {{previous}} studio album. Michael Gray wrote: [...] "The very title undercuts {{any idea that}} inspired work may lie within. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> further devaluing {{of the notion of}} a new Bob Dylan album as something significant." [...] The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years. Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.|$|E

500|$|Gerry {{served in}} the Second Continental Congress from February 1776 to 1780, when matters of the ongoing war {{occupied}} the body's attention. [...] He was influential in convincing a number of delegates to support passage of the United States Declaration of Independence in the debates held {{during the summer of}} 1776; John Adams wrote of him, [...] "If every Man <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Gerry, the Liberties of America would be safe against the Gates of Earth and Hell." [...] He was implicated {{as a member of the}} so-called [...] "Conway Cabal", a group of Congressmen and military officers who were dissatisfied with the performance of General George Washington during the 1777 military campaign. [...] However, Gerry took Pennsylvania leader Thomas Mifflin, one of Washington's critics, to task early in the episode, and specifically denied knowledge of any sort of conspiracy against Washington in February 1778.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{the main}} cast {{proposed}} for the film included Marilyn Miller, Gilda Gray, Ann Pennington, and Leon Errol. Featured in the film are William Powell as Ziegfeld, Myrna Loy as Billie Burke, Luise Rainer as Anna Held, Nat Pendleton as Eugen Sandow, and Frank Morgan. Powell admitted to being [...] "amazed" [...] with the film after viewing it and was very grateful at having had the privilege to portray Ziegfeld, considering {{it to be a}} very important moment in his career. He said, [...] "After seeing this film I can see that most of the characters I have played before were contrived. They had no 'folks', as the character of Ziegfeld had in this picture. Their father was a pen and their mother was a bottle of ink. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> character with flesh, blood and sinews. I felt {{for the first time in}} my acting career I had tried the full measure of a man, regardless of my shortcomings in playing him." ...|$|E
500|$|Wolstencroft {{stated that}} after {{watching}} the episode with his friends, they both commended and criticised his work: [...] "I got some angry phone calls from my friends the next day saying 'how could you, but well done, but how could you, {{but she was so}} nice, but how could you, but well done'." [...] Oyelowo also responded to the controversy, believing that it came from a result of Faulkner's male fans. Comedian Charlie Brooker however, commended the scene, as well as the series in general, stating in his Guardian column: [...] "The moment her head was forced into the deep-fat-fryer, viewers reared on the formulaic, it'll-be-alright-in-the-end blandness of cookie-cutter populist dramas like Casualty and Merseybeat sat up and blinked in disbelief: <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> major BBC drama series that actually had the nerve to confound expectation." [...] In a January 2010 poll, fans of the show voted Helen's death as the [...] "most shocking death scene" [...] in the series, drawing 49% of the votes.|$|E

500|$|Selena {{suggested}} {{the idea of}} writing and recording a track based on a story about her grandparents titled [...] "Amor Prohibido". She explained it to A.B. who began co-writing it with Astudillo and herself. The singer was inspired by love letters written by her grandmother who wrote about her experiences as a maid to a wealthy family and her infatuation with their son. Her grandmother was forbidden to formulate a relationship with him because of her social class and described it as [...] "forbidden love". Pérez wrote that during its recording session: <b>here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> noticeable difference between her voice on [...] and [...] Entre a Mi Mundo, especially. I can't {{say that it was}} an improvement, exactly, because I always thought that Selena's voice sounded incredible. It's just that her voice was richer and more mature than before, and her singing was more emotional and powerful as a result. While recording the song, Selena had ad-libbed [...] "oh baby". Her brother believed that the recording would [...] "not have been the same if she had not added the 'oh baby' part." ...|$|E
500|$|Whenever bandleader Brian Wilson {{composed}} for the Beach Boys, he typically {{relied on}} others to provide lyrics to his music. At this stage, he usually worked with bandmate Mike Love, whose assertive persona provided the youthful swagger that contrasted against Wilson's explorations in romanticism and sensitivity. Occasionally, Wilson {{would work with}} lyricists outside of his band's circle. Love recalls that he [...] "was not happy" [...] when this would occur—except {{in the case of}} Roger Christian, whose special knowledge of motor jargon he says benefited the group's car songs. Cultural historian Kevin Starr explains that the group first connected with young Americans specifically for their lyrical interpretation of a mythologized landscape: [...] "Cars and the beach, surfing, the California Girl, all this fused in the alembic of youth: <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> way of life, an iconography, already half-released into the chords and multiple tracks of a new sound." [...] The group's [...] "California Sound" [...] grew to national prominence through the success of their 1963 album Surfin' U.S.A., which helped turn the surfing subculture into a mainstream youth-targeted advertising image widely exploited by the film, television, and food industry.|$|E
500|$|Hardy said: [...] "He {{combined}} a {{power of}} generalization, a feeling for form, and a capacity for rapid modification of his hypotheses, that were often really startling, and made him, in his own peculiar field, without a rival in his day. The limitations of his knowledge were as startling as its profundity. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> man who could work out modular equations and theorems... to orders unheard of, whose mastery of continued fractions was... beyond that of any mathematician in the world, who had found for himself the functional equation of the zeta function and the dominant terms {{of many of the}} most famous problems in the analytic theory of numbers; and yet he had never heard of a doubly periodic function or of Cauchy's theorem, and had indeed but the vaguest idea of what a function of a complex variable was...". When asked about the methods Ramanujan employed to arrive at his solutions, Hardy said that they were [...] "arrived at by a process of mingled argument, intuition, and induction, of which he was entirely unable to give any coherent account." [...] He also stated that he had [...] "never met his equal, and can compare him only with Euler or Jacobi." ...|$|E
