After the forces are defeated, Zack and Sephiroth track down Hollander's secret laboratory, and learn that Hollander had used both Genesis and Angeal as part of Project G, an attempt to create soldiers infused with Jenova cells. Sephiroth faces off against Genesis, whilst Zack pursues Hollander. However, Angeal <b>is</b> <b>intent</b> <b>on</b> keeping Hollander alive as he wants {{to find a way}} to return to normal, and so he prevents Zack from killing the doctor by knocking Zack into the slums of Midgar.|$|E

Shachath tells her that the other times, she still had hope and purpose, but now she is willing to help Jude find peace. Sister Jude agrees, but says she must do one last thing. She visits the parents of the girl she killed, Missy, claiming to be a nun who found her calling after hearing of Missy's accident. She <b>is</b> <b>intent</b> <b>on</b> telling them the truth, when an adult Missy (Kristin Slaysman) walks into the home, revealing that she had in fact survived the accident.

But I’m a betting man and I’ll bet {{anything}} that she’s Jack’s baby". In 2013, eighteen-year-old Summer (Hunter King) <b>is</b> <b>intent</b> <b>on</b> losing her virginity, and develops an interest for Jack Abbott's son Kyle Abbott (Blake Hood). Responding to this, head writer Josh Griffith stated that they were [...] "looking {{at the possibility of}} anything".

500|$|Wollstonecraft {{states that}} {{currently}} {{many women are}} silly and superficial (she refers to them, for example, as [...] "spaniels" [...] and [...] "toys"), but argues {{that this is not}} because of an innate deficiency of mind but rather because men have denied them access to education. Wollstonecraft <b>is</b> <b>intent</b> <b>on</b> illustrating the limitations that women's deficient educations have placed on them; she writes: [...] "Taught from their infancy that beauty is woman's sceptre, the mind shapes itself to the body, and, roaming round its gilt cage, only seeks to adorn its prison." [...] She implies that, without the encouragement young women receive from an early age to focus their attention on beauty and outward accomplishments, women could achieve much more.|$|E

The freighter is owned by Charles Widmore (Alan Dale), who <b>is</b> <b>intent</b> <b>on</b> extracting the Others' leader Ben Linus (Michael Emerson). Captain Gault (Grant Bowler) stops two crewmembers from deserting the freighter in a raft. He publicly beats them and shouts that this is to save their lives, reminding the crew of what happened to George Minkowski (Fisher Stevens) when he left the boat. The next morning, Sayid Jarrah (Naveen Andrews) confronts Michael about his motivations, and the narrative shifts into an uninterrupted flashback of Michael's life after escaping from the island.|$|E

Paul either decides {{to take it}} and buy time {{for himself and his}} plan, or succumb to paranoia and illness. As stutters become nearly constant, Jack fights through the Monarch HQ with the guidance of either head of surveillance Charlie Wincott or Wincott's close friend Fiona Miller. Reaching Paul's lab, Jack finds either Wincott or high-level Monarch security officer Liam Burke, who <b>is</b> <b>intent</b> <b>on</b> stopping him. Acquiring the CFR, Jack learns that Paul was using it to power a [...] "lifeboat," [...] a small bunker where researchers could devise a solution to the end of time while protected from it. Unable to work the CFR, Jack uses Monarch's time machine (equipped with the stolen university core) to travel back to its first activation: the night of Will's death.|$|E
500|$|Sil's violent outbursts {{during sleep}} make the {{scientists}} consider her a threat. They {{try to kill}} her using cyanide gas but she breaks out of her containment cell and escapes.

Sil matures rapidly into an adult (Natasha Henstridge) in her early twenties and makes her way to Los Angeles. Her body strength, regenerative ability and intelligence make tracking her extremely difficult. The scientists fear she may mate with human males and produce offspring that could eliminate the human race. Sil <b>is</b> <b>intent</b> <b>on</b> producing offspring as soon as possible, and kills several people {{to prevent them from}} notifying the authorities or simply to use their clothing.|$|E

Brock is involuntarily recruited onto the team after being possessed by the Toxin symbiote which Thompson stole for Crime Master in Venom #12. The Savage Six is sent after Thompson and his loved ones after he tries to murder Crime Master, resulting in Betty's learning Thompson's secret identity.

Venom later confesses his covert actions to the Secret Avengers. Jack O'Lantern escapes and goes on a killing spree to torment Venom, abusing his father's body; he is eventually defeated and incarcerated by Venom.|$|E
500|$|Romm's 2006 book Hell and High Water {{projects}} that humans have {{a window of}} opportunity of only about a decade to head off the most catastrophic effects of global warming. [...] It calls upon Americans to demand government action to encourage and require the use of current emission-cutting technologies. [...] Tyler Hamilton, in his review of the book for The Toronto Star, wrote: [...] "Whereas the first third of Romm's book presents overwhelming and disturbing evidence that human-caused greenhouse gases are the primary ingredients behind global warming, the pages that follow offer alarming detail on how the U.S. public is being misled by a federal government (backed by conservative political forces) that <b>is</b> <b>intent</b> <b>on</b> inaction, and that's also on a mission to derail international efforts to curb emissions." [...] Technology Review wrote that Hell and High Water [...] "provides an accurate summary of what is known about global warming and climate change, a sensible agenda for technology and policy, and a primer on how political disinformation has undermined climate science." ...|$|E

Adam Poniński, marshal of the Sejm, {{pointing}} in red court dress, either demands that Rejtan leaves or points to the armed Russian guards outside the door; he holds a simple wooden walking stick instead of a [...] more elaborate marshall's staff, which Rejtan stole a day earlier. Behind him are bishop Ignacy Massalski and Prince Antoni Stanisław Czetwertyński-Światopełk. To his right, Hetman Franciszek Ksawery Branicki hides his face in his hands; which likely was Matejko's solution for a prosaic problem — he probably did not have access to a likeness of Branicki. Szczęsny Potocki, with the blue sash, looks to the ground, embarrassed. Behind the overturned chair, his father, Franciszek Salezy Potocki, also embarrassed, drops a quill pen and looks away. Between the two Potockis Jacek Małachowski is engaged in discussion with Samuel Korsak, while Karol Radziwiłł simply observes the situation, amused. On the ground, turned over, lies an amchair, with Branicki's hat and a coin purse, from which the coins spill towards Poniński, alluding to the real reason he <b>is</b> <b>intent</b> <b>on</b> concluding the debate.|$|E
