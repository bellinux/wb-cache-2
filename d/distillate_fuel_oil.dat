40|$|This report {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} data collected from gas service providers and end-use customers in the six New England States and offers a preliminary assessment {{of the impact of}} interruptible gas customers on the <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> market this past winter. Based on information collected and analyzed as of October 2000, the main findings areas follows: (1) For interruptible gas customers with <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> as a backup fuel, their volume of interruptions was equivalent to about 1 to 2 percent of the total sales of <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> in New England during January-February 2000. For the two peak weeks of gas supply interruptions, however, the equivalent volume of <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> amounted to an estimated 3 to 6 percent of total sales in New England. There were no interruptions of the natural gas service during the 2 -month period. (2) Purchases of <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> by interruptible gas customers may have contributed somewhat to the spike in the price of <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> in January-February 2000, especially during the peak weeks of gas interruptions. Nevertheless, other factors [...] a sudden drop in temperatures, low regional stocks of distillate fuels, and weather-related supply problems during a period of high customer demand [...] appear to have {{played a significant role in}} this price spike, as they have in previous spikes. (3) While this preliminary analysis suggests that interruptible natural gas service does not threaten the stability of the home heating oil market, several steps might be taken-without undermining the benefits of interruptible service [...] to reduce the potential adverse impacts of gas supply interruptions in times of market stress. Regardless of the magnitude of the impact of <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> purchases by interruptible gas customers on Northeast heating oil markets, the threat of future heating oil price spikes and supply problems still remains. To help counter the threat, President Clinton in July 2000 directed Secretary Richardson to establish a heating oil component of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in the Northeast, and 2 million barrels of heating oil are now stored in the reserve.

40|$|The {{outlook for}} <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> this winter is for {{increased}} demand {{and a return}} to normal inventory patterns, assuming a resumption of normal, cooler weather than last winter. With industrial production expected to grow slightly from last winter`s pace, overall consumption is projected to increase 3 percent from last winter, to 3. 4 million barrels per day during the heating season (October 1, 1995 -March 31, 1996). Much of the supply win come from stock drawdowns and refinery production. Estimates for the winter are from the Energy Information Administration`s (EIA) 4 th Quarter 1995 Short-Tenn Energy Outlook (STEO) Mid-World Oil Price Case forecast. Inventories in place on September 30, 1995, of 132 million barrels were 9 percent below the unusually high year-earlier level. Inventories of high-sulfur <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil,</b> the principal type used for heating, were 13 percent lower than a year earlier. Supply problems are not anticipated because refinery production and the ready availability of imports should be adequate to meet demand. Residential heating off prices are expected to be somewhat higher than last winter`s, as the effects of lower crude oil prices are offset by lower distillate inventories. Heating oil is forecast to average $ 0. 92 per gallon, the highest price since the winter of 1992 - 93. Diesel fuel (including tax) is predicted to be slightly higher than last year at $ 1. 13 per gallon. This article focuses on the winter assessment for <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil,</b> how well last year`s STEO winter outlook compared to actual events, and expectations for the coming winter. Additional analyses include regional low-sulfur and high-sulfur distillate supply, demand, and prices, and recent trends in <b>distillate</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> inventories...|$|E
30|$|Europe {{was confronted}} with {{shrinking}} <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> markets from 1970 onwards and more dramatically, after 1979, clearly reflected by oil company BP[88] sales data 1965 to 2011 which specifies the quantities of the crude oil distillation products, light distillates (gasoline, petrol), middle <b>distillates</b> (diesel) and <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> (which {{can be converted to}} diesel) sold for Europe. The reasons for the lack of demand for middle distillates were at the least twofold. First, natural gas had increasingly pushed out <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> as a heating fuel at the continental European market since the mid 1960 s[89]. In Germany, 18.6 million (48 %) households were connected to natural gas networks by 2009 ([URL] 2012). Then, in the 1960 s in France, General de Gaulle's thrust to make nuclear the key to energy independence meant closing old power plants fuelled with middle distillates[90]. Some experts believe that just the need of the European oil refinery industry to place the excess <b>fuel</b> <b>oil</b> on domestic markets made the powertrain paradigm shift to diesel cars happen (for Germany[91]; for France J. Lemaire, 2012, personal communication). Deputy mayor of Paris Denis Baupin argues[92] that Peugeot was encouraged to massively produce diesel cars in order to get rid of diesel oil overproduction.|$|R

As of 2016, almost all of the petroleum-based diesel fuel available in UK, Europe and North America is of a ULSD type. In the UK, diesel fuel for on-road use is commonly abbreviated DERV, standing for diesel-engined road vehicle, which carries a tax premium over equivalent fuel for non-road use.
