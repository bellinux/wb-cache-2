50|$|Once {{the driver}} inputs a <b>brake</b> <b>command</b> {{to the system}} via a human-machine {{interface}} - HMI (e.g. the brake pedal), four independent <b>brake</b> <b>commands</b> are generated by the ECU based on high level brake functions such as anti-lock braking system (ABS) or vehicle stability control (VSC). These command signals are sent to the four electric calipers (e-calipers) via a communication network.

50|$|Slack action {{creates a}} danger of {{accident}} as {{the length of a}} train increases. This is particularly the case when a train stops in a siding and is more or less compressed.

There have been very serious incidents with this effect. Slack action also can lead to severe longitudinal forces in a train that can result in a divided train. While accidents from slack action do occur in the operation of passenger trains, they are not of sufficient severity to cause serious injury or damage, regardless of train length. The draft gear of modern couplers is designed to reduce slack action over older technology, such as link and pin connections.|$|R

Recent designs for brake-by-wire systems use resolvers to provide accurate and continuous measurements for both absolute position and speed of the [...] of the actuators. Incremental encoders are relative position sensors and their additive error needs to be calibrated or compensated for by different methods. Unlike the encoders, resolvers provide two output signals that always allow the detection of absolute angular position. In addition, they suppress common mode noise and are especially useful in a noisy environment. Because of these reasons, resolvers are usually applied {{for the purpose of}} position and speed measurement in brake-by-wire systems. However, nonlinear and robust observers are required to extract accurate position and speed estimates from the sinusoidal signals provided by resolvers.|$|R

30|$|The master {{controller}} {{was the primary}} means of controlling the tram and integrated throttle and <b>braking</b> <b>commands</b> into a single lever. These were mapped to the direction of travel (i.e. moving the {{master controller}} forward moved the tram forward). Participants described a process {{of working with the}} master controller to understand how throttle manipulations influenced tram speed. This was a non-technical skill and descriptions supported the joint-cognitive systems view [12]. The master controller is ultimately associated with the safety function of ensuring a smooth passenger journey task and subtask, as shown in Fig.  3. The problems observed with the master controller fell into a number of categories and included designs with low correspondence between body and arm posture, variation in reach distances, and forearm pads that did not facilitate contact with all master controller notch positions. For example, the master controller in Fig.  4 was integrated into the right-arm of the driver seat and could only be adjusted by pivoting the armrest up or down at the point it joined the rear of the chair. The way that master controller movements graduated with accelerating and braking also varied between trams, within and between the two sites. Predicting changes in tram speed was therefore less reliable and reported as a contributing factor to work-related stress.|$|R

40|$|The {{main goal}} of this {{investigation}} is to integrate an electronically controlled pneumatic (ECP) brake model with efficient longitudinal train force algorithms based on the trajectory coordinate formulations. The ECP brake model, developed in this investigation consists of the train line (cable), locomotive automatic brake valve, air brake pipe, and ECP manifold. The train line, which covers {{the entire length of}} the train, allows the <b>brake</b> <b>commands</b> to be received by the car simultaneously. While pneumatic pressure is used to generate the braking forces, the brake pipe is no longer used to provide the <b>brake</b> level <b>commands.</b> Instead, the <b>brake</b> pipes are used to provide a continuous supply of compressed air stored in a reservoir mounted on each railcar. Using the ECP system to apply the brakes uniformly and instantaneously gives better train control, shortens the stopping distances, and leads to a lower risk of derailment. In this investigation, the fluid continuity and momentum equations are used to develop the governing air pressure flow equations. These partial differential equations are converted to a set of ordinary differential equations using the finite element method leading to an air brake force model that accounts for the effect of the air flow in long train pipes as well as the effect of leakage and branch pipe flows. The car brake forces are applied to the wheels using the ECP manifold located in each car. The ECP manifold used in this investigation has four valves: cut-off valve, vent valve, auxiliary valve, and emergency valve. The ECP manifold is connected to three main pneumatic components: the auxiliary reservoir, the emergency reservoir, and the brake cylinder. The reservoirs serve as the main storage of the pressurized air, while the brake cylinder and other mechanical components such as the rigging and the brake shoes transmit the brake force to the wheels. In this investigation, a mathematical model of the ECP manifold and its components is developed. The relationship between the main components of the ECP brake system and the train dynamics is discussed, and the final set of differential equations that integrates the ECP brake and train dynamics is presented. Different simulation scenarios are considered in this study in order to investigate the effect of the brake forces on the train longitudinal dynamics in the case of different braking scenarios. The performance of the developed ECP brake system is compared with the Association of American Railroads safety and operation standards, and with experimental results published in the literature...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} new braking torque {{distribution}} strategy for electric {{vehicles equipped with}} a hybrid hydraulic braking and regenerative braking system. The braking torque distribution strategy is proposed based on the required braking torque and the regenerative braking system 2 ̆ 7 s status. To get the required braking torque, a new strategy is designed based on the road conditions and driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions. Through the estimated road surface, a robust wheel slip controller is designed to calculate the overall maximum braking torque required for the anti-lock braking system (ABS) under this road condition. Driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions are classified as the emergency braking and the normal braking. In the case of emergency braking, the required braking torque is to be equal to the overall maximum braking torque. In the case of normal <b>braking,</b> the <b>command</b> <b>braking</b> torque {{is proportional to the}} pedal stroke. Then the required braking torque is chosen as the smaller one between the overall maximum braking torque and the <b>command</b> <b>braking</b> torque. To acquire both high regenerative efficiency and good braking performance when the required braking torque is smaller than the maximum braking torque of the regenerative braking system, the whole braking torque can be provided by the regenerative braking system; when the required braking torque is bigger than the maximum braking torque of the regenerative braking system, the whole braking torque can be provided by both the hydraulic braking system and the regenerative braking system, while the maximum braking torque of the regenerative braking system is obtained based on the battery state of charge (SOC) and vehicle speed in real-time. Both fuzzy rule-based scheduling and robust control approaches will be applied to achieve the above proposed distribution strategy. The effectiveness of the proposed control system is validated by numerical simulations under various road conditions, vehicle speeds, driver 2 ̆ 7 s braking intentions, and the battery SOCs...|$|R

40|$|All {{electric}} machines {{have two}} mechanical operations, motoring and braking. The nature of braking can be regenerative, where the kinetic {{energy of the}} rotor is converted into electricity and {{sent back to the}} power source or non-regenerative, where the source supplies electric power to provide braking. This thesis investigates several critical issues related to regenerative braking in both DC and AC electric machines, including the determination of boundaries in the torque-speed plane defining the regenerative braking capability region and the evaluation of operating points within that capability region that result in maximum regenerative braking recharge current. Electric machines are used in the powertrains of electric and hybrid-electric vehicles to provide motoring or braking torque in response to the driver's request and power management logic. Since such vehicles carry a limited amount of electrical energy on-board their energy storage systems (such as a battery pack), it is important to conserve as much electrical energy as possible in order to increase the range of travel. Therefore, the concept of regenerative braking is of importance for such vehicles since operating in this mode during a braking event sends power back to the energy storage system thereby replenishing its energy level. Since the electric machine assists the mechanical friction braking system of the vehicle, it results in reduced wear on components within the mechanical friction brake system. As both mechanical friction braking and electric machine braking are used to provide the requested vehicle braking torque, braking strategies which relate to splitting of the <b>braking</b> <b>command</b> between the two braking mechanisms are discussed. The reduction in energy consumption of a test vehicle along different driving schedules while using different braking strategies is also studied.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. The great {{anatomical}} {{diversification of}} paired fins within the Actinopterygii (ray-finned fishes) {{can be understood}} as a suite of evolutionary transformations in design. At a broad taxonomic scale, two clear trends exist in the morphology of the anteriorly situated pectoral fins. In comparing basal to more derived clades, there are general patterns of (i) reorientation of the pectoral fin base from a nearly horizontal to more vertical inclination, and (ii) migration of the pectoral fin from a ventral to mid-dorsal body position. As yet, the functional significance of these historical trends in pectoral fin design remains largely untested by experiment. In this paper we test the proposal that variation in pectoral fin structure has an important influence on the magnitude and orientation of fluid forces generated during maneuvering locomotion. Using digital particle image velocimetry for quantitative wake visualization, we measure swimming forces in ray-finned fishes exhibiting the plesiomorphic and apomorphic pectoral fin anatomy. Our experiments focus on rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), a lower teleost with pectoral fins positioned ventrally and with nearly horizontally inclined fin bases, and bluegill sunfish (Lepomis macrochirus), a relatively derived perciform fish with more vertically oriented pectoral fins positioned mid-dorsally on the body. In support of hypotheses arising from our prior wake studies and previously untested models in the literature, we find that the pectoral fins of sunfish generate significantly higher forces for turning and <b>direct</b> <b>braking</b> forces closer to the center of mass of the body than the pectoral fins of trout. These results provide insight into the hydro-dynamic importance of major evolutionary transformations in pectoral fin morphology within the Actin-opterygii...|$|R

40|$|The {{organisation}} of {{the muscular}} activities {{responsible for the}} termination of gait, their modulation {{as a function of}} the rate of progression and the associated mechanical effects were investigated in normal adults, using EMG, force plate and kinematic recordings. In particular, the braking actions in reaction to a visual cue presented at the instant of heel-strike were analysed quantitatively, with a focus on representative leg and thigh muscles of the weight-supporting (stance) and oscillating (swing) limb, during walk-and-stop trials performed at three different velocities. In the stance limb, the EMG associated with braking started approximately 150 ms after the stop signal and, on average, displayed a distal-to-proximal activation sequence that primarily involved the posterior muscle groups (soleus, SOL, and hamstring, HAM). With the exception of SOL, which showed a single EMG burst, EMG patterns consisted of two or three progressively larger components occurring reciprocally in antagonistic muscles. Increasing walking speed yielded a significant reduction of the activity in distal muscles, and a simultaneous increment in proximal muscles. The mechanical effect of the earlier braking actions, estimated from the backward-directed wave of the horizontal ground reaction force, decreased in a velocity-dependent manner. In the swing limb the braking activities began approximately 330 ms after the stop signal and, on average, revealed a proximal-to-distal activation sequence with the extensor groups (quadriceps, QUAD, and SOL) playing a prominent role. They always consisted of single EMG bursts, largely co-activated in the antagonist muscles. The onset latencies of the individual components showed a close correlation, and the spatio-temporal parameters were always scaled in parallel. Unlike the stance limb, the mechanical braking action associated with the final contact of the swing limb increased with walking speed. The results indicate that the muscle synergies responsible for the rapid termination of gait in response to a ground-contact visual cue are produced by a relatively flexible set of motor commands modulated according to different velocity-dependent strategies in the weight-bearing limb, and by a single, fairly robust motor programme in the swing limb.
