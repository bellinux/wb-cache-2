5|$|The {{thermal wind}} {{relation}} {{does not explain}} why the winds are organized into tight jets, rather than distributed more broadly over the hemisphere. One factor {{that contributes to the}} creation of a concentrated polar jet is the undercutting of sub-tropical air masses by the more dense polar air masses at the polar front. This causes surface low pressure and higher pressure at altitude. At high altitudes, lack of friction allows air to respond freely to the steep pressure gradient with low pressure at high altitude over the pole. This results in the formation of planetary wind circulations that experience a strong Coriolis deflection and thus can be considered 'quasi-geostrophic'. The polar front jet stream is closely linked to the <b>frontogenesis</b> process in midlatitudes, as the acceleration/deceleration of the air flow induces areas of low/high pressure respectively, which link to the formation of cyclones and anticyclones along the polar front in a relatively narrow region.|$|E

50|$|<b>Frontogenesis</b> is a {{meteorological}} {{process of}} tightening of horizontal temperature gradients to produce fronts. In the end, {{two types of}} fronts form: cold fronts and warm fronts. A cold front is a narrow line where temperature decreases rapidly. A warm front is a narrow line of warmer temperatures and essentially {{where much of the}} precipitation occurs. <b>Frontogenesis</b> occurs {{as a result of a}} developing baroclinic wave. According to Hoskins & Bretherton (1972, p. 11), there are eight mechanisms that influence temperature gradients: horizontal deformation, horizontal shearing, vertical deformation, differential vertical motion, latent heat release, surface friction, turbulence and mixing, and radiation. Semigeostrophic <b>frontogenesis</b> theory focuses on the role of horizontal deformation and shear.|$|E

50|$|<b>Frontogenesis</b> is {{the process}} of {{creating}} or steepening the temperature gradient of a front. During this process the atmosphere reacts in an attempt to restore balance, the consequence is a circular motion along the front where air is being lifted up, along the cold front and dropping downward, behind the frontal boundary. This is the actual force of upward motion along a front that is responsible for clouds and precipitation.|$|E

50|$|Skip {{formed from}} a {{tropical}} disturbance near 20N 124E on June 26. A sharp trough connected Ruby with Skip at this time, which was undergoing <b>frontogenesis</b> as Ruby became extratropical. By late morning on June 30, Skip was of tropical storm strength accelerating up the frontal boundary to its northeast with limited convection near its center, {{and was considered}} by the Joint Typhoon Warning center as a subtropical cyclone in its annual report. By July 2, what limited convection was {{near the center of}} Skip disappeared, and it became an extratropical cyclone.|$|E
50|$|As the {{temperature}} gradient steepens during <b>frontogenesis,</b> the thermal wind becomes imbalanced. To maintain balance, the geostrophic wind aloft and below adjust, such that regions of divergence/convergence form. Mass continuity {{would require a}} vertical transport of air along the cold front where there is divergence (lowered pressure). Although this circulation is described {{by a series of}} processes, they are actually occurring at the same time, observable along the front as a thermally direct circulation. There are several factors that influence the final shape and tilt of the circulation around the front, ultimately determining the kind and location of clouds and precipitation.|$|E

50|$|On January 23, a {{low-pressure}} area developed off the Pacific Northwest, before quickly {{moving over}} the Canadian Prairies by January 24.

50|$|On March 9, an extratropical cyclone {{formed in}} the North Pacific Ocean. On March 11, it began to affect parts of the Northwestern United States as well as British Columbia in Canada. It {{eventually}} moved ashore later that day and transferred its energy to a new surface low, which began to move southeastwards into the United States as an Alberta clipper. The system moved swiftly across the Upper Midwest throughout the day of March 12, dropping a swath of accumulating snow of 3-6 in as <b>frontogenesis</b> took place. On March 13 at 15:00 UTC, the Weather Prediction Center began issuing storm summaries while the system was located west-northwest of St. Louis, Missouri. Throughout the day, a weak secondary {{area of low pressure}} {{formed in the}} Gulf of Mexico and drifted northeastwards, while not expected to fuse with the other low to its north, it helped inject moisture from the ocean over the state of Florida, which gradually began to merge with the outermost fringes of the northerly system that had now moved into the Ohio Valley.|$|E
50|$|Horizontal {{deformation}} in mid-latitude cyclones concentrates temperature gradients—cold {{air from}} the north and warm {{air from the}} south. Horizontal shear has two effects on an air parcel; it tends to rotate the parcel (think of placing a wheel at a point in space and as the wind blows, the wheel rotates) and deform the parcel through stretching and shrinking. In the end, this can also tighten temperature gradient, but most importantly, this rotates a concentrated temperature gradient for example, from the x-axis to the y direction. Within a mid-latitude cyclone, these two key features play an essential role in <b>frontogenesis.</b> On the west side of a typical mid-latitude cyclone, there are northerly winds (associated with cold air) and east of the cyclone, southerly winds (associated with warm air); resulting in horizontal shear deformation. In the end, this results to concentrate a cyclonic shear along a line of maximum shear (which in this case is the birth of a cold front). On the eastern side of a cyclone, horizontal deformation is seen which turns into confluence (a result of translation + deformation). Horizontal deformation at low levels is an important mechanism for the development of both cold and warm fronts (Holton, 2004).|$|E
50|$|The {{horizontal}} shear and horizontal deformation direct to concentrate the pole-equator temperature gradient {{over a large}} synoptic scale (1000 km). The quasi-geostrophic equations fail in the dynamics of <b>frontogenesis</b> because this weather phenomenon is of smaller scale compared to the Rossby radius; so semigeostrophic theory is used. Generally, Rossby number—ratio of inertial to coriolis terms—is used to formulate a condition of geostrophic flow. Across the front, the Rossby number is {{on the order of}} udu/dx/fv = (10 m/s)^2/(1000 km)/(1e-4 s-1)/(1 m/s) = 1; this shows we cannot ignore the inertial term (one must take into account the ageostrophic wind). Along the front, the Rossby number is on the order of udv/dx/fu = (10 m/s)/(1000 km)*(1e-4 s-1)*(10 m/s) = 0.01, which means it is in geostrophic and thermal wind balance. Finally, looking at a cross section (y-z) through the confluent flow, using Q-vectors (Q pointing toward upward motion), on the warm side (bottom of confluent schematic), there is upward motion and on the other hand, the cold side (top of confluent schematic), there is downward motion.The cross-section points out convergence (arrows pointing towards each other) associated with tightening of horizontal temperature gradient. Conversely, divergence is noticed (arrows point away from each other), associated with stretching horizontal temperature gradient. Since the strength of the ageostrophic flow is proportional to temperature gradient, the ageostrophic tightening tendencies grow rapidly after the initial geostrophic intensification.|$|E

Then, as it neared the coast, a new {{area of low pressure}} developed off the Outer Banks and began to move northwards, as snowfall expanded into parts of the Mid-Atlantic, reaching into areas like Connecticut. Most of the precipitation associated with this system was snowfall, due to an ongoing cold wave, which due to this made forecasting very easy.
