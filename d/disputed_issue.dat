5|$|There is {{no clear}} {{evidence}} that the classic Maya were aware of precession. Some Maya scholars, such as Barbara MacLeod, Michael Grofe, Eva Hunt, Gordon Brotherston, and Anthony Aveni, have suggested that some Mayan holy dates were timed to precessional cycles, but scholarly opinion on the subject remains divided. There is also little evidence, archaeological or historical, that the Maya placed any importance on solstices or equinoxes. It is possible that only the earliest among Mesoamericans observed solstices, but {{this is also a}} <b>disputed</b> <b>issue</b> among Mayanists. There is also no evidence that the classic Maya attached any importance to the Milky Way; there is no glyph in their writing system to represent it, and no astronomical or chronological table tied to it.|$|E
25|$|In 1880 Gina Krog {{travelled}} to Great Britain, {{where she}} stayed a {{while at the}} Bedford College, and made contacts with the National Union of Women's Suffrage Societies {{and the leader of}} the organization Millicent Garrett Fawcett. Back in Norway she started writing newspaper articles, first under pseudonyms, and later under her own name. She belonged to the radical feminists, demanding full equal political rights between women and men, contrasting the more moderate feminists who focused on the improvement of women's financial conditions. She proclaimed the women's right to vote on equal conditions as men, without compromise. This point of view came to be a <b>disputed</b> <b>issue</b> within the feminist movement of the time.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of neighbourhood security {{has been a}} constant focus of research since Oscar Newman's work. New research has expanded the discussion on this <b>disputed</b> <b>issue.</b> A recent study did extensive spatial analysis and correlated several building, site plan and social factors with crime frequencies and identified subtle nuances to the contrasting positions. The study looked at, among others, dwelling types, unit density (site density) movement on the street, culs–de-sac or grids and the permeability of a residential area. Among its conclusions are, respectively, that flats are always safer than houses and the wealth of inhabitants matters, density is generally beneficial but more so at ground level, local movement is beneficial, but not larger scale movement, relative affluence and the number of neighbours have a greater effect than either being on a cul-de-sac or being on a through street. It also re-established that simple, linear culs-de-sac with good numbers of dwellings that are joined to through streets tend to be safe. As for permeability, it suggests that residential areas should be permeable enough to allow movement in all directions but no more. The overprovision of poorly used permeability is a crime hazard. The open, uniform grid could be seen as an example of undifferentiated permeability.|$|E

500|$|In March 845, a {{fleet of}} 120 Danish Viking ships {{containing}} more than 5,000 men [...] entered the Seine {{under the command of}} a Danish chieftain named [...] "Reginherus", or Ragnar. [...] This Ragnar has often been tentatively identified with the legendary saga figure Ragnar Lodbrok, but the accuracy of this remains a <b>disputed</b> <b>issue</b> among historians. [...] Around 841, Ragnar had been awarded land in Turholt, Frisia, by Charles the Bald, but he eventually lost the land as well as the favour of the King. [...] Ragnar's Vikings raided Rouen on their way up the Seine in 845, [...] and in response to the invasion, determined not to let the royal Abbey of Saint-Denis (near Paris) be destroyed, Charles assembled an army which he divided into two parts, one for each side of the river. [...] Ragnar attacked and defeated one of the divisions of the smaller Frankish army, took 111 of their men as prisoners and hanged them on an island on the Seine. [...] This was done to honour the Norse god Odin, as well as to incite terror in the remaining Frankish forces.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, a major dispute arose {{when the}} Asian Strategic and Leadership Institute (ASLI) {{issued a report}} calculating Bumiputra-held equity at 45% – a stark {{difference}} from the official figure of 18.9%. The report's publication triggered a relatively vocal public debate {{about the status of}} the NEP and its related policies, with many from UMNO questioning the methodology used by ASLI. One strongly <b>disputed</b> <b>issue</b> was ASLI's decision to consider government-linked companies (GLCs) as Bumiputra-owned, inflating the calculated figure of Bumiputra equity. Although ASLI later withdrew the report, citing unspecified errors in its methodology, the debate did not die down. One political analyst suggested that [...] "If Bumiputra equity is 45 per cent, then surely the next question is, why the need for Bumiputera rights? It has implications for government policy and it (removing indigenous rights) is one thing UMNO will never accept at present." [...] Others have argued that the debate over inter-ethnic disparities has obscured intra-ethnic inequities, citing the increased Gini coefficient for Bumiputras (from 0.433 in 1999 to 0.452 in 2004), Chinese (0.434 to 0.446) and Indians (0.413 to 0.425).|$|E

2500|$|Fatimah's burial {{place is}} a <b>disputed</b> <b>issue</b> among Muslims from {{different}} sects. It is famous that Ali ibn Abi Taleb buried his wife in an unknown location, because it was Fatimah's decision [...] According to Madelung in The Succession to Muhammad, the secret burial {{was done with the}} aim of avoiding the presence of caliph (Abu Bakr). Different locations have been mentioned as the possible burial places of Fatimah some of which are said to be nearer to fact. Al-Baqi', her house and between the Prophet's tomb and his minbar are the possible places of her grave. One of the important reasons that Fatima’s grave was concealed is because of her protest against what happened regarding to the caliphate of the Holy prophet. [...] Hence, as long as the Muslims don’t believe in what Fatima believes relating to the Holy prophet’s succession, the reason for the concealment of her grave will remain. One of the historians in this filed says: [...] "… In any case, concealment of the prophet’s daughter indicates that she was dejected about some people and it’s clear that she wanted to declare her dissatisfaction and unhappiness".|$|E
2500|$|Rhodesia was {{involved}} in the war in Mozambique, supporting the Portuguese troops in operations and conducting operations independently. By 1973, the territory was mostly under Portuguese control. The Operation [...] "Nó Górdio" [...] (Gordian Knot Operation) - conducted in 1970 and commanded by Portuguese Brigadier General Kaúlza de Arriaga - a conventional-style operation to destroy the guerrilla bases in the north of Mozambique, was the major military operation of the Portuguese Colonial War. A hotly <b>disputed</b> <b>issue,</b> the Gordian Knot Operation was considered by several historians and military strategists as a failure that worsened the situation for the Portuguese. Others did not share this view, including its main architect, troops, and officials who had participated {{on both sides of the}} operation, including high ranked elements from the FRELIMO guerrillas. It was also described as a tremendous success of the Portuguese Armed Forces. Arriaga, however, was removed from his powerful military post in Mozambique by Marcelo Caetano shortly before the events in Lisbon that would trigger the end of the war and the independence of the Portuguese territories in Africa. The reason for Arriaga's abrupt fate was an alleged incident with indigenous civilian populations, and the Portuguese government's suspicion that Arriaga was planning a military coup against Marcelo's administration in order to avoid the rise of leftist influences in Portugal and the loss of the African overseas provinces.|$|E

These different understandings are further elaborated. Karlsson’s article is also instructive in alerting us to three tensions or aporiai (<b>disputed</b> <b>issues</b> or questions) {{in the effort to}} grasp the nature and meaning of dialogue and the concept of ‘dialogic evaluation’. These tensions {{have to do with the}} interpretation of the Socratic conception of dialogue, notions of learning and judging, and the idea of ‘critique’.

The diquark is often treated as a single subatomic particle with which the third quark interacts via the strong interaction.

Diquark-antidiquark pairs have also been advanced for anomalous particles such as the X(3872).|$|E
