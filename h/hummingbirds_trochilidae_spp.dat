2500|$|The main {{families}} of specialized nectar feeding birds {{that are involved}} in ornithophily are the <b>hummingbirds</b> (<b>Trochilidae),</b> sunbirds (Nectariniidae), and the honey-eaters (Meliphagidae). Other important bird groups include those in the families the Icteridae, the honeycreepers (Thraupidae, Drepanidae), white-eyes (Zosteropidae) and the South African sugar-birds (Promeropidae). Birds may obtain nectar either by perching or by hovering with the latter mainly found in the hummingbirds and sunbirds.

5|$|The {{avifauna}} of the West Indies {{is predominantly}} of tropical North American (southern North America and Central America) origin with aggressive South American species having colonized the area only recently. The South American families {{occurring in the}} Greater Antilles are the <b>hummingbirds</b> (<b>Trochilidae),</b> tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae), bananaquit (Coerebidae) and tanagers (Thraupidae), {{all of which are}} represented in Puerto Rico. The prevailing theory suggests that bird fauna colonized the West Indies by transoceanic dispersal during the glacial periods of the Pleistocene. The most primitive West Indies birds are the todies which have an endemic representative in Puerto Rico, the Puerto Rican tody.|$|R

40|$|The {{spectacular}} evolutionary radiation of <b>hummingbirds</b> (<b>Trochilidae)</b> {{has served}} as a model system for many biological studies. To begin to provide a historical context for these investigations, we generated a complete matrix of DNA hybridization distances among 26 hummingbirds and an outgroup swift (Chaeturu pelagica) to determine the principal hummingbird lineages. FITCH topologies estimated from symmetrized AT,H-C values and subjected to various validation methods (bootstrapping, weighted jackknifing, branch length significance) indicated a funda-mental split between hermit (Eutoxeres uquilu, Threnetes ruckeri; Phaethornithinae) and nonhermit (Trochilinae) hummingbirds, and provided strong support for six principal nonhermit clades with the following branching order: (1) a predominantly lowland group comprising caribs (Eulumpis holosericeus) and relatives (Androdon uequutoriuli...|$|R
