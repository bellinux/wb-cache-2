25|$|In March 2012, <b>Ennahda</b> {{declared}} {{it will not}} support making sharia {{the main source of}} legislation in the new constitution, maintaining the secular nature of the state. Ennahda's stance on the issue was criticized by hardline Islamists, who wanted strict sharia, but was welcomed by secular parties. On 6 February 2013, Chokri Belaid, the leader of the leftist opposition and prominent critic of <b>Ennahda,</b> was assassinated.|$|E
25|$|A {{political}} crisis evolved in Tunisia following {{the assassination of}} leftist leader Mohamed Brahmi in late July 2013, during which the country's mainly secular opposition organized several protests against the ruling Troika alliance that was dominated by Rashid al-Ghannushi's Islamist <b>Ennahda</b> Movement. The events came {{as part of the}} aftermath of the Tunisian Revolution which ousted the country's longtime president Zine El Abidine Ben Ali, followed by a general election which saw <b>Ennahda</b> win a plurality alongside Moncef Marzouki's allied Congress for the Republic (CPR). The crisis gradually subsided when Prime Minister Ali Laarayedh resigned and a new constitution was adopted in January 2014.|$|E
25|$|Following the revolution, an {{election}} for a constituent assembly which had 217 seats {{was held on}} 23 October 2011 that saw the <b>Ennahda</b> Movement led by Rashid al-Ghannushi win a plurality in the election (41% of the seats) closely followed by the Congress for the Republic (CPR) led by Moncef Marzouki (13.4% of the seats) who was later elected as President of Tunisia by the Constituent Assembly.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Ennahda's</b> Lotfi Zitoun {{said the}} party had [...] "accepted this result and congratulates the winner." ...|$|R
50|$|Ensuing <b>Ennahda's</b> {{success in}} the Constituent Assembly {{election}} on 23 October 2011, the party nominated him as its candidate for prime minister. Jebali is considered a proponent of the reformist wing of his party.|$|R
50|$|The {{party is}} more {{moderate}} in urbanized {{areas such as}} Tunis, where secular and socially liberal beliefs predominate. However, <b>Ennahda's</b> compromises and abanding of Political Islam has made their core supporters lose faith in them.|$|R
25|$|On 3 March 2011, the {{president}} announced that elections to a Constituent Assembly would be held on 23 October 2011. International and internal observers declared the vote free and fair. The <b>Ennahda</b> Movement, formerly banned under the Ben Ali regime, won a plurality of 90 seats {{out of a total}} of 217. On 12 December 2011, former dissident and veteran human rights activist Moncef Marzouki was elected president.|$|E
25|$|Like their {{counterparts}} {{elsewhere in the}} Islamic world in general, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood has influenced the Tunisian Islamists. One of the notable organization that was influenced and inspired by the Brotherhood is <b>Ennahda</b> (The Revival or Renaissance Party), which is Tunisia's major Islamist political grouping. An Islamist founded the organization in 1981. While studying in Damascus and Paris, Rashid Ghannouchi embraced {{the ideology of the}} Muslim Brotherhood, which he disseminated on his return to Tunisia.|$|E
25|$|The protests {{intensified}} on October 23, 2013, when {{thousands of}} demonstrators {{took to the streets}} calling for the government to step down hours before talks between the ruling Islamist coalition and opposition leaders that concluded with <b>Ennahda</b> promising to resign in three weeks ending a months-old political deadlock. In exchange for Ennahda's resignation, the opposition agreed to pass a constitution in which freedom of worship will be guaranteed but in the same time gave a greater role to religion in public life than before.|$|E
2500|$|... 7 February 2013 – Tunisia's {{governing}} Islamists rejected Jebali's plan {{to dismiss}} the government without consulting other party members. [...] "The prime minister did not ask the opinion of his party," [...] said Abdelhamid Jelassi, <b>Ennahda's</b> vice-president.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ennahda's</b> Rachid Ghannouchi {{said after}} the victory announcement: [...] "We salute Sidi Bouzid and its sons who {{launched}} the spark {{and we hope that}} God will have made Mohamed Bouazizi a martyr. We will continue this revolution to realize its aims of a Tunisia that is free, independent, developing and prosperous in which the rights of God, the Prophet, women, men, the religious and the non-religious are assured because Tunisia is for everyone." ...|$|R
2500|$|... 23 October 2013 – Prime Minister Ali Larayedh {{confirmed}} {{that the government was}} ready to resign but insisted that the new constitution be completed first and an electoral commission be established, with a clear election date before handing over power. Hours before crisis talks between the Islamist-led government and the mainly secular opposition, thousands of Tunisians doubtful about the <b>Ennahda's</b> intentions rallied across the country calling for the government's immediate resignation. However, talks have been delayed to Friday following clashes between Islamist militants and security forces that left six policemen dead.|$|R
25|$|Ben Ali {{initially}} {{took some}} steps to liberalise the regime. He dismantled the personality cult surrounding his predecessor. He also amended {{the constitution to}} limit the president {{to a total of}} three five-year terms, with no more than two in a row. In 1988, several Islamist activists were released from prison. He also forged a national pact with the Tunisian party Harakat al-Ittijah al-Islami (Islamic Tendency Movement), which had been founded in 1981; later it changed its name to <b>Ennahda</b> (the Renaissance Party). He also changed the ruling party's name to the Democratic Constitutional Rally.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} period Shayk Mohamed Fadhel Ben Achour, who was mufti of Tunisia and rector of the University of Ez-Zitouna, issued a fatwa, result of a {{personal}} ijtihad. At {{the same time the}} reformist newspaper <b>Ennahda</b> published the poems of Aboul-Qacem Echebbi, who participated to a lesser extent than Haddad in the defence of the rights of women. In 1947, Muhammad Abdu'l Aziz Jait, former justice minister who was later opposed to the Code and author of a majallah codifying personal status and estate law, undertook an initial and timid effort to harmonize the doctrines of the Maliki and the Hanafi, majority in Tunisia, that ultimately had no result.|$|E
25|$|In this context, presidential {{feminism}} remains ambiguous, as {{is illustrated}} by the speech delivered during the UNFT's third congress, held between December 20–29, 1962, in which he declared that he had to protect the family and guarantee to man the faculty of being its head. The policy of Bourguiba lost its vitality in the 1970s.This absence of new reforms can be explained in different ways: the deterioration of the president's health, the delayed reaction of conservatives remaining reserved in the course of preceding decades and the resistance of society shaken to its foundations. At the same time, power desired the destabilization of the Marxist left and encouraged the founding of the Association for the Preservation of the Koran in January 1968 which contributed to the birth of the Islamist party <b>Ennahda.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In the 1989 elections, President Ben Ali {{banned the}} party from {{participating}} but allowed some members {{to run as}} independents. These received between 10% and 17% of the vote nationally according to official figures of the regime, and despite what some observers thought was [...] "widespread fraud". Allegedly surprised by <b>Ennahda’s</b> popularity, [...] two years later Ben Ali banned the movement and jailing 25,000 activists. Ennahdha activists attacked the ruling party headquarters, killing one person and splashing acid {{in the faces of}} several others. [...] Many Ennahdha members went into exile.|$|R
5000|$|When in March 2012, the {{preamble}} {{of the new}} Tunisian Constitution was discussed, Ayadi supported <b>Ennahda's</b> proposal to keep intact Article 1 of the 1959 constitution describing {{the country as a}} republic with Arabic being its language and Islam its religion. Ayadi said: [...] "As long as the identity of the country is Arab-Muslim, the article remains accurate and relevant." [...] The decision could potentially prevent the abuse of religion for political gains, he said: [...] "Prophet Mohammed used politics for religion. Now we are afraid that some will use religion for politics - especially when the goals aren’t always clear." ...|$|R
50|$|Aridha Chaabia had lists in six electoral districts (8 seats total) voided by {{the electoral}} {{commission}} {{on the grounds}} that it violated election rules by campaigning during the purdah period and because of evidence of foreign funding. At the first announcement of the disqualification, Tunisian journalists in the electoral commission's media center burst into applause and sang the Tunisian national anthem, demonstrating a general suspicion of the Aridha Chaabia lists. In reaction, the party's supporters set fire to the mayor's office and a court in Sidi Bouzid and more than 2,000 protesters congregated outside <b>Ennahda's</b> headquarters in the same town and pelted stones at security forces. Hachmi Hamdi then also said that he would withdraw all 19 seats won by the party. In reaction to the violence a curfew was imposed from 19:00 on 18 October to 5:00 on 29 October and, though tensions remained, there were no violent incidents reported. However, Aridha Chaabia's other list leaders refused to withdraw; consequently Hamdi reverted his decision and also called on the leaders of the nullified lists to appeal against the decision. The Administrative Court accepted, on Tuesday, the appeals filed by Aridha in the districts of Sidi Bouzid, Sfax-1, Jendouba, Kasserine and Tataouine. Aridha Chaabia thus recovered 7 of its 8 invalidated seats, bringing its total to 26. Following this, however, twelve parliament members of Aridha Chaabia resigned from the party and declared themselves independent members.|$|R
25|$|The post-revolution Tunisia has {{witnessed}} an unprecedented rise in radical Islamism, known as Salafism, with increasing militant activity, weapons smuggling from Libya {{and involvement in}} the political scene. They range from self-claimed moderate parties like <b>Ennahda</b> to the more hard-line Ansar al-Sharia and Hizb ut-Tahrir. Most of them denounced violence {{as a way to}} reach their goals and have advocated democracy. However, some have been engaged in numerous clashes with security forces mainly in the south and north-west of the country resulting in numerous casualties on both sides in a conflict that is often related to the wider Maghreb insurgency. Several attacks by jihadist factions took place in the Mount Chaambi national park on the border with Algeria. On 29 July 2013, a military convoy was ambushed by militants resulting in a number of deaths with many of the victims found beheaded and others mutilated. A week later, the Tunisian Armed Forces responded with an army offensive and air strikes to clear out the mountains of Islamist elements responsible for the assaults.|$|E
2500|$|... 9 February 2013 – Thousands of Islamists held a mass {{rally in}} a show of {{strength}} to support Rashid al-Ghannushi and the ruling <b>Ennahda</b> party.|$|E
2500|$|... 28 October 2013 – <b>Ennahda</b> leader, Rashid al-Ghannushi, {{said in a}} {{televised}} interview that the party {{may be willing to}} give up the government but not power.|$|E
2500|$|... 25 July 2013 – Thousands {{of protesters}} {{took to the}} streets in {{response}} to the assassination of Mohamed Brahmi in the presence of his wife and daughter earlier this day. The demonstrators gathered in masses around the Interior ministry building in Tunis calling for the government to resign and chanting [...] "Down with Islamist rule" [...] and shouted slogans against <b>Ennahda</b> leader, Rashid Ghannushi calling him a murderer. Similar demonstrations took place in Brahmi's hometown Sidi Bouzid where it is reported that two <b>Ennahda</b> party offices were set fire to by angry mobs.|$|E
2500|$|... 23 October - Tunisians {{vote for}} the first time post-revolution. The {{election}} appointed members to a Constituent Assembly charged with rewriting Tunisia's Constitution. The formerly banned Islamic party <b>Ennahda</b> won by capturing 41% of the total vote.|$|E
2500|$|... – The {{government}} of the founding state of the Arab Spring, condemned the [...] "flagrant coup," [...] with [...] <b>Ennahda</b> party leader Rachid Ghannouchi expressing his astonishment {{and said that the}} removal of Morsi would undermine democracy and feed radicalism.|$|E
2500|$|... – The {{leader of}} the Tunisian {{political}} <b>Ennahda</b> Movement Rashid Al-Ghannushi congratulated Erodoğan via social media. The party's spokesperson Ziyad el-Uzari stated that the victory showed that democracy was a viable option in the Arab Spring. Tunisian President Moncef Marzouki also congratulated Erdoğan by phone.|$|E
2500|$|... 1 March - The <b>Ennahda</b> Movement is legalised. The resignations of the Minister for Higher Education and Scientific Research Ahmed Brahim and the Minister of Local Development Ahmed Nejib Chebbi are officially {{announced}} by the Tunis Afrique Presse (TAP) agency. A private radio broadcaster Shems FM also reported that the Minister of Economic Reform Elyes Jouini had resigned as well.|$|E
2500|$|Investigations {{had been}} issued {{following}} both assassinations and Interior Minister Lotfi Ben Jeddou announced {{at a news}} conference that the same 9mm automatic weapon that killed Belaid also killed Brahmi. The Chokri Belaid defense committee spokesman Tayeb Oqaili claimed on 2 October that, according to official documents, Abdulhakim Belhadj of the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group was involved in the killings of both Belaid and Brahmi, pointing to links between the LIFG, Ansar al Sharia and the <b>Ennahda</b> Movement. The left-wing leader maintained that Belhadj apparently intended to carry out terrorist attacks in Tunisia, and trained the Ansar al-Sharia cell that killed the opposition politicians, all under close observation by <b>Ennahda</b> leaders Rashid al-Ghannushi, Hamadi Jebali and Samir Dilou, among others. On 19 September 2013, Tunisia's interior minister told lawmakers the CIA informed authorities Brahmi was a target and said there'd been a [...] "failure" [...] in the security services' response. He announced an investigation had been opened.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Ennahda</b> Movement {{had long}} been banned in the {{political}} spectrum by former President Ben Ali, most notably in the 1989 elections where some of its members had to run independently due to government repression. Two years after the elections Ben Ali jailed nearly 25,000 of its activists with <b>Ennahda</b> militants responding by attacking the ruling party's headquarters killing one person and splashing acid on others. Following the revolution, it described itself to be a [...] "moderate Islamist" [...] party by advocating democracy and recognizing political pluralism and dialogue with the West. Its supporters back then regarded the party {{as an example of}} how a balance can be struck between modernity and Islamism while its critics viewed it as a threat to secularism in Tunisia, which was often regarded as the most secular Arab state. In addition, leading <b>Ennahda</b> figures have repeatedly tried to reassure worrying Tunisians that it would protect civil rights and democracy. However, the movement was accused to have been shaped by Qutbism and is highly influenced by the Muslim Brotherhood of Egypt and many of its secular opponents pointing out to acid attacks on female students in the 1980s for dressing [...] "indecently" [...] as a warning sign from Islamist repression. It is also believed that Rashid al-Ghannushi himself, the co-founder of the party had a long history of violent thinking. Following Ben Ali's ouster, the party was legalized and Ghannushi was welcomed by a crowd of 1,000 people upon his return to the country after 22 years of exile in Europe. Ghannushi later formed an alliance called the Troika with two secular political parties which are Moncef Marzouki's CPR and the Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties.|$|E
2500|$|On 6 February 2013, Chokri Belaid {{was leaving}} his house {{on his way}} to the {{headquarters}} of the Tunisian General Labour Union for a meeting with its secretary general when he was shot four times by a gunman who later took off on a motorbike driven by a second accomplice. Belaid was quickly rushed to the nearest clinic but the doctors couldn't save him and he was pronounced dead at the moment. Current secretary general of Belaid's party and leader of the Popular Front, Ziad Lakhdhar, said in a statement: [...] "Chokri Belaid was killed today by four bullets to the head and chest ... doctors told us that he has died. This is a sad day for Tunisia". It was also reported that Belaid had received several death threats prior to his assassination with many of his supporters blaming <b>Ennahda</b> for failing to protect him following those threats and an incident targeting fellow party members a week earlier. Belaid had always attacked the [...] "Leagues for the Protection of the Revolution" [...] (LPR), a government-aligned nationwide organization that claims to root out remnants of Ben Ali's regime but are accused of thuggish behaviour towards opposition groups, and he claimed that there are groups inside <b>Ennahda</b> that incite violence and that the LPR's committees are tools used by the government and its allied Islamists to get rid of the party's leftist coalition. The night before the incident, he appeared in a political talk show on Tunisia's Nessma TV and said; [...] "Rashid Ghannushi considers the leagues to be the conscience of the nation, so the defense of the authors of violence is clear. All those who oppose <b>Ennahda</b> become the targets of violence." [...] Following his assassination, thousands of demonstrators gathered outside the Interior Ministry building in Tunis carrying Belaid's coffin and shouted [...] "The people demand the fall of the regime". The day turned violent when some of the protesters threw rocks with the police using tear gas to disperse the rallies.|$|E
2500|$|... 14 December 2013 – UGTT head, Houcine Abassi, {{announced}} that politicians had {{agreed on a}} new acting Prime Minister, Mehdi Jomaa, after talks between the ruling <b>Ennahda</b> party and the opposition. Out of 21 parties participating in the dialogue, 18 were supposed {{to participate in the}} election of the new PM with 9 voting in favor of Jomaa. Seven had withdrawn, including Nidaa Tounes, due to their opposition of Jomaa's candidacy because {{he was a member of}} the governing cabinet serving as Minister of Industry. In addition, two parties voted for the runner-up and three were absent.|$|E
2500|$|... 17 January - Ghannouchi announces his cabinet, {{including}} twelve {{members of}} the ruling RCD, the leaders of three opposition parties (Mustapha Ben Jafar from the Democratic Forum for Labour and Liberties (FTDL), Ahmed Brahim of the Ettajdid Movement, and Ahmed Najib Chebbi of the Progressive Democratic Party), three representatives from the Tunisian General Labour Union (UGTT) and representatives of civil society (including prominent blogger Slim Amamou). Three notable movements {{not included in the}} national unity government were the banned <b>Ennahda</b> Movement, the communist Tunisian Workers' Communist Party and the secular reformist Congress for the Republic. Daily protests begin against the presence of RCD members in the new government. Thousands of anti-RCD protesters rally in a protest with relatively little violence between security services and protestors.|$|E
2500|$|This {{forced the}} {{religious}} authorities likewise {{to interpret the}} Koran {{in a way that}} accepted the fact that women could receive an education and participate in the social life of the country. The majority of the religious leaders had benefiting from their own daughters being advantaged by the changes in society. Ben Ali later granted a presidential pardon to Rached Ghannouchi, freed on May 14, 1988. Under government pressure he expressed confidence in the president and recognition that the Code represents, [...] "In its entirely a fitting means to organize family relations." [...] Nevertheless, Islamists continued their project to annul the Code and this so well that its previous acceptance constituted an acceptable condition for the legislation of political parties which had not been in accord with <b>Ennahda.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... 20 January - Hundreds {{of people}} {{demonstrate}} outside the RCD headquarters in Tunis {{with the same}} aims, and protests in other towns around Tunisia are reported. Zouhair M'Dhaffer, a close confidant of Ben Ali seen as the main architect of the 2002 constitutional reform to lift term limits, resigns from the government. All other RCD ministers resign from the party {{on the same day}} and the central committee of the RCD disbands itself on that day. The new government announces in its first sitting that all banned parties would be legalised and that all political prisoners would be freed. It was unclear whether the ban on these parties and the ban on Hizb ut-Tahrir would be lifted until 12 March 2011, when they were declared as banned again. The <b>Ennahda</b> Movement on the other hand, got a permit.|$|E
2500|$|... 6 February 2013 – Following news of Chokri Belaid's {{assassination}} {{earlier in}} the day by unknown gunmen, thousands of his supporters took to the streets across the nation. The National Guard fired tear gas at protesters who barricaded Avenue Habib Bourguiba using bins, coffee tables and barbed wire. Other violent protests erupted {{in other parts of the}} country including Mezzouna where people torched the premises of the <b>Ennahda</b> party, Gafsa where the party's offices were ransacked and in Sidi Bouzid, the birthplace of the 2011 revolution, where 4,000 demonstrators reportedly flooded the city, burning tyres and throwing rocks at security forces prompting clashes with the protesters. In an evening televised address, Prime Minister Hamadi Jebali announced that he would dissolve the government and said that he [...] "decided to form a government of competent nationals without political affiliation." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the {{overthrow}} of Ben Ali, Tunisians elected a Constituent Assembly to draft a new constitution, and an interim government known as the Troika {{because it was a}} coalition of three parties; the Islamist <b>Ennahda</b> Movement in the lead, with the centre-left Congress for the Republic and the left-leaning Ettakatol as minority partners. Widespread discontent remained however, leading to the 2013–14 Tunisian political crisis. As a result of the efforts made by the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet, the Constituent Assembly completed its work, the interim government resigned, and new elections were held in 2014, completing the transition to a democratic state. The Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet was awarded the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize for [...] "its decisive contribution to the building of a pluralistic democracy in Tunisia {{in the wake of the}} Tunisian Revolution of 2011".|$|E
2500|$|On 25 July 2013, Mohamed Brahmi {{was shot}} dead in his {{car in front of}} his home in Tunis by unknown gunmen on a {{motorbike}} in front of his wife Mbarka and his daughter Belkis who were both shocked after the tragedy. The incident occurred on the day Tunisia was set to celebrate Republic Day when the country was celebrating the 56th anniversary of the beginning of Habib Bourguiba's presidency. He was later transported to Charles Nicolle Hospital after being paraded down Avenue Habib Bourguiba by thousands of his supporters including relatives and fellow party members who demonstrated and blamed the incumbent <b>Ennahda</b> Party and their followers for the assassination while shouting [...] "Down with the rule of the Islamists!". They were also joined by his wife and daughter in front of the hospital where he died. Hundreds of supporters also protested in Brahmi's hometown of Sidi Bouzid. During Brahmi's funeral, protesters called for the government to be toppled, while police fired tear gas on them. According to a statement made by the Tunisian Prosecutor regarding the autopsy of Brahmi's corpse; [...] "The deceased had been hit with fourteen gunshots: six in his torso and eight in his left leg”. Brahmi's killing was condemned by many international leaders including UN Human Rights chief Navi Pillay and President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz who said in a statement; [...] "I am deeply saddened to learn of the despicable murder of our colleague Mohamed Brahmi. I condemn this assassination in the strongest terms." ...|$|E
