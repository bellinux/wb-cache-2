30|$|Finally, we have {{showed that}} if a ramping time of a few seconds is introduced, the allowed delays can be longer, but from a power system’s {{perspective}} an immediate response results in better frequency profiles (smaller deviations and settling times for the power oscillations). Therefore, {{there is a clear}} trade-off between the loads’ <b>response</b> <b>delay</b> and their ramping rate. If the <b>response</b> <b>delay</b> is relatively large due to practical limitations (for instance due to a long FMT), then the ramping rate must decrease, to avoid large power oscillations and unsafe system operation. This trade-off can be incorporated in the PFC scheme by defining certain allowed regions for combinations of <b>response</b> <b>delays</b> and ramping rates. The operator would enforce lower ramping rates to aggregations which exhibit larger <b>response</b> <b>delays</b> and would allow faster ramping rates when loads can <b>response</b> with smaller <b>delays.</b> Since a higher ramping rate improves the system’s performance (provided that the delay is sufficiently small), a performance payment should be followed, where these resources would be remunerated with higher prices, to ensure a fair compensation to the providers.|$|R

40|$|When an {{imminent}} attack by a predator {{on a group}} of birds is signalled to non-detectors only by the departure of the detector, non-detectors may make time-wasting false-alarm flights in response to mistaken or non-predator-driven departures. The frequency of false-alarm flights might be reduced if group members assess the reason for single departures before responding. Immediate flights should only occur after multiple simultaneous departures, because these are only likely to be generated by an attack. The <b>response</b> <b>delay</b> between the detectors' departure and the next birds that respond should then be dependent on the number of detectors. On sparrowhawk attack, <b>response</b> <b>delays</b> in redshanks decreased significantly as detector number increased, controlling for raptor conspicuousness and proximity, and flock size and spacing. If <b>response</b> <b>delay</b> is modified because of risk dilution, it should increase with flock size and, consequently, the rate of alarm flights due to mistakes should decrease. However, <b>response</b> <b>delay</b> did not increase and flight frequency due to misidentification of non-raptors or non-predator-driven departures did not decrease with flock size. Significantly more feeding time was lost by birds in small flocks, suggesting that the dilution effect decreased the cost of each false-alarm flight rather than their frequency...|$|R

Spectrum sensing is the cornerstone of cognitive radio. However, current hardware platforms for cognitive radio introduce time delays that undermine the accuracy of spectrum sensing. The time <b>delay,</b> named <b>response</b> <b>delay,</b> incurred by hardware and software can be measured at two antennas co-located at a secondary user (SU), the receiving antenna and the transmitting antenna. In this paper, minimum <b>response</b> <b>delays</b> are experimentally quantified and reported based on two hardware platforms, the universal software radio peripheral 2 (USRP 2) and the small form factor software defined radio development platform (SFF SDR DP). The <b>response</b> <b>delay</b> has negative impact on the accuracy of spectrum sensing. A modified hidden Markov model (HMM) based single-secondary-user (single-SU) prediction is proposed and examined. When multiple SUs exist and their channel qualities are diverse, cooperative prediction can benefit the SUs as a whole. A prediction scheme with two stages is proposed, where the first stage includes individual predictions conducted by all the involved SUs, and the second stage fur-ther performs cooperative prediction using individual single-SU prediction results obtained at the first stage. In addition, a soft-combining decision rule for cooperative prediction is proposed. In order to have convincing performance evaluation results, real-world Wi-Fi signals are used to test the proposed approaches, where the Wi-Fi signals are recorded at four different locations simultaneously. Experimental results show that the proposed single-SU prediction outperforms the 1 -nearest neighbor (1 -NN) prediction which uses current detected state as an estimate of future states. Moreover, even with just a few SUs, cooperative prediction leads to overall performance improvement.

40|$|Action {{potential}} (AP) {{responses of}} dentate gyrus granule (DG) cells {{have to be}} tightly regulated to maintain hippocampal function. However, which ion channels control the <b>response</b> <b>delay</b> of DG cells is not known. In some neuron types, spike latency is influenced by a dendrotoxin (DTX) -sensitive delay current (ID) mediated by unidentified combinations of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channels of the Kv 1 family Kv 1. 1 - 6. In DG cells, the ID has not been characterized and its molecular basis is unknown. The response phenotype of mature DG cells is usually considered homogenous but intrinsic adaptations likely occur in particular in conditions of hyperexcitability, for example during temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE). In this study, we examined <b>response</b> <b>delays</b> of DG cells and underlying ion channel molecules by employing a new combination of gramicidin-perforated patch-clamp recordings in acute brain slices and single-cell reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain reaction (SC RT-qPCR) experiments. An in vivo mouse model of TLE consisting of intrahippocampal kainate (KA) injection {{was used to examine}} epilepsy-related plasticity. <b>Response</b> <b>delays</b> of DG cells were DTX-sensitive and strongly increased in KA-injected hippocampi; Kv 1. 1 mRNA was elevated 10 -fold, and the <b>response</b> <b>delays</b> correlated with Kv 1. 1 mRNA abundance on the single cell level.

The biophysical properties of ID and the delay heterogeneity between inner and outer DG cell layer were characterized. Using organotypic hippocampal slice cultures (OHCs), where KA incubation also induced ID upregulation, reversibility and neuroprotective potential for DG cells were tested. In summary, the AP timing of DG cells is effectively controlled via scaling of Kv 1. 1 subunit transcription.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{statistical}} approach to distributed detection of local latency shifts in networked systems. For this purpose, <b>response</b> <b>delay</b> measurements are performed between neighbouring nodes via probing. The expected probe <b>response</b> <b>delay</b> on each connection is statistically modelled via parameter estimation. Adaptation to drifting delays is {{accounted for by}} the use of overlapping models, such that previous models are partially used as input to future models. Based on the symmetric Kullback-Leibler divergence metric, latency shifts can be detected by comparing the estimated parameters of the current and previous models. In order {{to reduce the number of}} detection alarms, thresholds for divergence and convergence are used. The method that we propose can be applied to many types of statistical distributions, and requires only constant memory compared to e. g., sliding window techniques and decay functions. Therefore, the method is applicable in various kinds of network equipment with limited capacity, such as sensor networks, mobile ad hoc networks etc. We have investigated the behaviour of the method for different model parameters. Further, we have tested the detection performance in network simulations, for both gradual and abrupt shifts in the probe <b>response</b> <b>delay.</b> The results indicate that over 90 % of the shifts can be detected.
