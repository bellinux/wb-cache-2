50|$|Online <b>editing</b> is a {{post-production}} linear video <b>editing</b> {{process that}} is performed in {{the final stage of}} a video production. It occurs after offline <b>editing.</b> For the most part, online <b>editing</b> has been replaced by video <b>editing</b> software that operate on non-linear <b>editing</b> systems (NLE). High-end postproduction companies still use the Offline-Online <b>Editing</b> workflow with NLEs.|$|R
50|$|Video <b>editing</b> is {{the process}} of <b>editing</b> {{segments}} of motion video production footage, special effects and sound recordings in the post-production process. Motion picture film <b>editing</b> is a predecessor to video <b>editing</b> and, in several ways, video <b>editing</b> simulates motion picture film <b>editing,</b> in theory and the use of linear video <b>editing</b> and video <b>editing</b> software on non-linear <b>editing</b> systems (NLE). Using video, a director can communicate non-fictional and fictional events. The goals of <b>editing</b> is to manipulate these events to bring the communication closer to the original goal or target. It is a visual art.|$|R

50|$|Content <b>editing,</b> {{also known}} as {{substantive}} <b>editing,</b> comprehensive <b>editing,</b> macro <b>editing,</b> or heavy <b>editing,</b> {{is a form of}} copy <b>editing</b> that evaluates the overall formatting, style, and content of a document in order to enhance visual design and comprehension. Comprehensive editors are a type of language professional.|$|R
50|$|Within copy <b>editing,</b> {{there is}} {{mechanical}} <b>editing</b> and substantive editing: Mechanical <b>editing</b> {{is the process}} of making a text or manuscript follow editorial or house style. The role of this particular type of <b>editing</b> is to keep the preferred style of publication consistent across all content, as well as make sure that generally accepted grammar rules are followed throughout. It refers to <b>editing</b> in terms of spelling, punctuation, correct usage of grammatical symbols, along with reviewing special elements like tables, charts, formatting footnotes, and endnotes. Content <b>editing,</b> also known as substantive <b>editing,</b> is the <b>editing</b> of material, including its structure and organization. In this type of <b>editing,</b> internal inconsistencies and discrepancies can be dealt with. Content <b>editing</b> oftentimes can require heavy <b>editing</b> or rewriting as compared to mechanical <b>editing.</b>|$|R
50|$|While {{nowadays}} all post-production <b>editing</b> is {{done with}} a non-linear <b>editing</b> system, in those days <b>editing</b> was done linearly, using online <b>editing.</b> <b>Editing</b> machines relied heavily on the 9-Pin Protocol to remotely control automatic players and recorders.|$|R

As well as a substantial introduction by the editors, it features ten sole-authored chapters split over three parts, with contributions from Wissenburg, Schlosberg, Manuel Arias-Maldonado, Chad Flanders, Christie Smith, Clemens Driessen, Simon Otjes, Kurtis Boyer, Per-Anders Svärd and Mihnea Tanasescu.|$|E

40|$|RNA <b>editing</b> changes posttranscriptionally single {{nucleotides}} in chloroplast-encoded transcripts. Although {{much work}} has been done on mechanistic and functional aspects of plastid <b>editing,</b> little is known about evolutionary aspects of this RNA processing step. To {{gain a better understanding of}} the evolution of RNA <b>editing</b> in plastids, we have investigated the <b>editing</b> patterns in ndhB and rbcL transcripts from various species comprising all major groups of land plants. Our results indicate that RNA <b>editing</b> occurs in plastids of bryophytes, fern allies, true ferns, gymnosperms, and angiosperms. Both <b>editing</b> frequencies and <b>editing</b> patterns show a remarkable degree of interspecies variation. Furthermore, we have found that neither plastid <b>editing</b> frequencies nor the <b>editing</b> pattern of a specific transcript correlate with the phylogenetic tree of the plant kingdom. The poor evolutionary conservation of <b>editing</b> sites among closely related species as well as the occurrence of single species-specific <b>editing</b> sites suggest that the differences in the <b>editing</b> patterns and <b>editing</b> frequencies are probably due both to independent loss and to gain of <b>editing</b> sites. In addition, our results indicate that RNA <b>editing</b> is a relatively ancient process that probably predates the evolution of land plants. This supposition is in good agreement with the phylogenetic data obtained for plant mitochondrial RNA <b>editing,</b> thus providing additional evidence for common evolutionary roots of the two plant organellar <b>editing</b> systems...|$|R
