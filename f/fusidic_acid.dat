5|$|Many species produce {{metabolites}} {{that are}} {{major sources of}} pharmacologically active drugs. Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the penicillins, a structurally related group of β-lactam antibiotics that are synthesized from small peptides. Although naturally occurring penicillins such as penicillin G (produced by Penicillium chrysogenum) have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, {{a wide range of}} other penicillins can be produced by chemical modification of the natural penicillins. Modern penicillins are semisynthetic compounds, obtained initially from fermentation cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties. Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: ciclosporin, commonly used as an immunosuppressant during transplant surgery; and <b>fusidic</b> <b>acid,</b> used to help control infection from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, and others began in the early 20th century and continues to date. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the rhizosphere, and at low concentrations as quorum-sensing molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling. Other drugs produced by fungi include griseofulvin isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum, used to treat fungal infections, and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins found in fungi include mevastatin from Penicillium citrinum and lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus and the oyster mushroom.|$|E
25|$|Topical <b>fusidic</b> <b>acid</b> is {{occasionally}} used as {{a treatment}} for acne vulgaris. As a treatment for acne, <b>fusidic</b> <b>acid</b> is often partially effective at improving acne symptoms. However, research studies have indicated that <b>fusidic</b> <b>acid</b> is not as highly active against Propionibacterium acnes as many other antibiotics that are commonly {{used as a}}cne treatments. <b>Fusidic</b> <b>acid</b> is also found in several additional topical skin and eye preparations (e.g. Fucibet), although its use for these purposes is controversial.|$|E

25|$|One {{important}} {{clinical use}} of <b>fusidic</b> <b>acid</b> is its activity against methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Although many strains of MRSA remain sensitive to <b>fusidic</b> <b>acid,</b> {{there is a}} low genetic barrier to drug resistance (a single point mutation {{is all that is}} required), <b>fusidic</b> <b>acid</b> should never be used on its own to treat serious MRSA infection and should be combined with another antimicrobial such as rifampicin when administering oral or topical dosing regimens approved in Europe, Canada, and elsewhere.

50|$|Fucibet {{cream and}} Fucibet lipid cream both contain two active ingredients, <b>fusidic</b> <b>acid</b> and {{betamethasone}} valerate.Fusidic acid is an antibiotic medicine. It works by entering bacterial cells and {{interfering with the}} production of proteins that the bacteria need to divide and multiply. It does not directly kill the bacteria, but leaves them unable to increase in numbers. The existing bacteria eventually die or are destroyed by the immune system. <b>Fusidic</b> <b>acid</b> is included in this preparation to treat the bacterial infection that can sometimes occur in eczema.Betamethasone {{is a type of}} medicine called a corticosteroid. Corticosteroids are medicines used for reducing inflammation. Skin inflammation in eczema occurs due to the irritation of the skin, and is caused by the release of various substances involved in the immune system. These substances cause blood vessels to widen, resulting in the affected area becoming red, swollen, itchy and painful.When betamethasone is applied to the skin it works by acting inside the cells to decrease the release of these inflammatory substances. This reduces swelling, redness and itch. Betamethasone is a potent corticosteroid.The combination of betamethasone and <b>fusidic</b> <b>acid</b> is used to treat eczema that is infected with bacteria.
