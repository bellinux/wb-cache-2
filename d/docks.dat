5|$|Seven {{terminal}} <b>docks</b> {{were constructed}} {{for the opening}} of the canal. Four small <b>docks</b> were located {{on the south side of}} the canal near Cornbrook, within the Borough of Stretford: Pomona <b>Docks</b> No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, and No. 4. The three main <b>docks,</b> built primarily for large ocean-going vessels, were in Salford, to the west of Trafford Road on the north bank of the canal, <b>docks</b> No. 6, No. 7, and No. 8. In 1905, No. 9 Dock was completed on the same site. Dock No. 5, known as Ordsall Dock, was part of Pomona <b>Docks,</b> but was dug on the Salford side of the river; it was never completed and was filled in around 1905.|$|E
5|$|Bute {{responded by}} putting {{commercial}} pressure on shipping companies {{to abandon the}} Glamorganshire Canal and using his feudal rights to force shippers to move their wharfs to his <b>docks.</b> His efforts paid off and although trade through the <b>docks</b> only came to 8,000 tons in 1839, they then rose quickly, reaching 827,000 tons by 1849. Between 1841 and 1848 the <b>docks</b> brought in a gross income of just under £68,000, a relatively disappointing figure compared {{to the size of}} the investment. Successive marquesses would find themselves under huge pressure to continue investing and expanding in the <b>docks</b> and subsequent phases of construction over the coming decades.|$|E
5|$|Deptford's {{population}} has been mainly associated with the <b>docks</b> since {{the establishment of the}} Royal <b>Docks</b> by Henry VIII, though there has also been some market gardening and potteries. When the <b>docks</b> were thriving as the main administrative centre of the British Navy, so the area prospered, and fine houses were built for the administrative staff and the skilled shipbuilders, and a few grand houses like Sayes Court and Stone House on Lewisham Way were erected.|$|E

5|$|In 1863, {{the railway}} network came to Milford, linking {{it to the}} Haverfordwest line and beyond. In 1866, work was {{completed}} on an additional extension which provided access to the <b>docks</b> and ship-breaking yard {{on the eastern side}} of the town. Between 1875 and 1886 The Great Eastern was a permanent fixture at Milford <b>Docks,</b> remaining there for lengthy repairs. Her arrival into the <b>docks</b> was heralded as an example of the scale of vessel which the town could expect to attract.|$|E

5|$|Salford <b>Docks</b> (also called Manchester <b>Docks)</b> {{were opened}} by Queen Victoria in 1894, {{providing}} <b>docks</b> in Manchester and Salford for the Manchester Ship Canal which linked Manchester to the sea. During the 1970s, the <b>docks</b> fell into decline as they proved {{too small for}} new, larger ships, {{and when they were}} abandoned in 1982 over 3,000 people lost their jobs. Salford City Council purchased the <b>docks</b> in 1984 and since then they underwent regeneration as a centre of tourism in Salford, which included the construction of the Lowry Centre. More than 10,000 people are employed in the Quays in jobs such as retail, construction, and e-commerce. In 2007, it was confirmed that the BBC would be moving five of its departments to a new development on Pier 9 of Salford Quays, to be called MediaCityUK. The move, which is expected to be completed by 2011, will create up to 15,500 jobs and add £1bn to the regional economy over 5 years.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dock</b> {{levelers}} {{are more}} expensive devices than the comparatively light-weight <b>dock</b> plates and <b>dock</b> boards. The {{most common form of}} <b>dock</b> leveler is the recessed, or pit, <b>dock</b> leveler. As the name suggests, this type of leveler is contained in a recess, or pit, beneath the <b>dock</b> door and floor surface. <b>Dock</b> levelers are stronger than <b>dock</b> plates and have similar ranges to <b>dock</b> boards, making them suitable not only for motorized fork lift trucks but also for master conveyors (for which neither <b>dock</b> plates or <b>dock</b> boards are suitable). Safety, also, is very high for this kind of product: Safety rules as EN1398 (European Standard) specifies the safety requirements for design, construction, installation, maintenance and testing of <b>dock</b> levelers and for safety components on <b>dock</b> levelers. NOTE: edge of <b>dock</b> levelers have fixed positions which have restricted ranges making them unsuitable for nonstandard <b>dock</b> heights.|$|R

5|$|The Railways Act 1921 brought most of {{the large}} coal-exporting <b>docks</b> in South Wales into the GWR's ownership, such as those at Cardiff, Barry, and Swansea. They were added to {{a small number of}} <b>docks</b> along the south coast of England which the company already owned, to make it the largest <b>docks</b> {{operator}} in the world.|$|E
5|$|The West India <b>Docks</b> were {{established}} in 1803, providing berths for larger ships and a model for future London dock building. Imported produce from the West Indies was unloaded directly into quayside warehouses. Ships were limited to 6000tons. The old Brunswick Dock, a shipyard at Blackwall {{became the basis for}} the East India Company's East India <b>Docks</b> established there in 1806. The London <b>Docks</b> were built in 1805, and the waste soil and rubble from the construction was carried by barge to west London, to build up the marshy area of Pimlico. These <b>docks</b> imported tobacco, wine, wool and other goods into guarded warehouses within high walls (some of which still remain). They were able to berth over 300 sailing vessels simultaneously, but by 1971 they closed, no longer able to accommodate modern shipping. The most central <b>docks,</b> St Katharine <b>Docks,</b> were built in 1828 to accommodate luxury goods, clearing the slums that lay {{in the area of the}} former Hospital of St Katharine. They were not successful commercially, as they were unable to accommodate the largest ships, and in 1864, management of the <b>docks</b> was amalgamated with that of the London <b>Docks.</b> The Millwall <b>Docks</b> were created in 1868, predominantly for the import of grain and timber. These <b>docks</b> housed the first purpose built granary for the Baltic grain market, a local landmark that remained until it was demolished to improve access for the London City Airport.|$|E
5|$|The <b>docks</b> {{occupy the}} former sound between Barry Island and the mainland. The {{contractors}} built dams to connect {{each end of}} the island to the mainland, drained or pumped the water from the site and excavated it. They used the material to level the area round the <b>docks</b> and for the core of breakwaters to protect the entrance. The works included a basin with gates at each end which served as a lock between the sea entrance and the <b>docks,</b> the dock walls and quays, coal loading equipment and railways to deliver coal from the mines to the <b>docks.</b> A second dock and second entrance lock were added in 1898. Barry Dock Offices were built in 1897-1900 by the architect Arthur E. Bell.|$|E

5|$|There was a {{start of}} a {{demographic}} shift downwards when the Royal Navy pulled out of Deptford, and the <b>docks</b> moved into storage and freight. The downward shift continued into the 20th century as the local population's dependency on the <b>docks</b> continued: as the <b>docks</b> themselves declined, so did the economic fortune of the inhabitants until the last dock, Convoys Wharf, closed in 2000.|$|E
5|$|These animals exploit more {{man-made}} environments like <b>docks</b> for haul-out sites.
