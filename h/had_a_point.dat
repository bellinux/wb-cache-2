5|$|The debacle at Kasserine Pass {{strained}} {{relations between}} the Allies, and another crisis developed when II Corps reported that enemy aviation was operating at will over its sector because of an absence of Allied air cover. This elicited a scathing response from British Air Marshal Arthur Coningham on the competence of American troops. Eisenhower drafted a letter to Marshall suggesting that Coningham should be relieved of his command since he could not control the acrimony between senior Allied commanders, but Smith persuaded him not to send it. Instead, Air Chief Marshal Arthur Tedder, Major General Carl Spaatz, and Brigadier General Laurence S. Kuter paid Patton a visit at his headquarters. Their meeting {{was interrupted by a}} German air raid that convinced the airmen that General Patton <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>point.</b> Coningham withdrew his written criticisms and he apologized.|$|E

She won her first French Open title since 1988 with a three-set victory over Mary Joe Fernández in the final. The win {{elevated}} Graf to the World No. 1 ranking {{for the first time}} in 22 months. At Wimbledon, Graf defeated Jana Novotná to win her third consecutive, and fifth overall, ladies' title. In the third and deciding set, Jana <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> to go up 5–1 on her serve. After breaking Novotná's serve, Graf won the next four games to take the match 7–6, 1–6, 6–4.

25|$|A {{paper by}} Israeli {{researcher}} Sandrine Boudana {{two years later}} analyzed responses to the Strauss-Kahn perp walk in French and American print media {{within the context of}} the countries' respective cultures. While the predominant theme was French media condemning the practice and American media defending it, commentators on both sides took the occasion to reflect inwardly. Some American writers said the French <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>point,</b> and French writers in turn noted the difficulty of enforcing the Guigou law in an era where technology cannot prevent the images it forbids from being viewed in France when published overseas. Others noted that the incident also showed the pitfalls of the French media's practice of not reporting on the private lives of politicians, noting that rape allegations had been raised earlier about Strauss-Kahn on a French talk show with no media followup.|$|E
25|$|At the Supreme War Council at the Trianon Palace Hotel, near Versailles (29 January - 2 February) Haig and Petain (French Commander-in-Chief) {{complained of}} {{shortage}} of troops. The BEF {{was facing a}} 100,000 manpower shortage by June 1918, whilst Petain talked of losing 25 divisions to natural wastage, but Haig’s political credibility was so low that Hankey wrote that they “made asses of themselves”. Haig argued against a common command, claiming {{that it would be}} “unconstitutional” for him to take orders from a foreign general. It was agreed that an Allied General Reserve be set up, under Foch with Henry Wilson as his deputy, but Haig argued {{that he did not have}} divisions to spare for this (worrying that they would be shipped off to fight the Turks but thinking the proposal would take time to be become operational) and suggested to the French Prime Minister Clemenceau (who was suspicious of Foch’s ambition to become generalissimo, and whom Haig thought “the soundest and pluckiest of the lot … a grand old man, full of go and determination”) that he might resign. Lord Milner thought Haig’s stance “desperately stupid”, although in Sheffield's view Haig <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> that control of reserves by a committee was not necessarily sensible. Clemenceau attacked Lloyd George’s wish to make offensives against Turkey top priority, and got Lloyd George to agree to delay offensives against the Turks for two months. Robertson openly opposed the Prime Minister; Haig did not speak in his defence, later writing that “LG never asked my opinion”. On the last day the conference discussed the General Reserve and extension of line. Again, Haig did not openly oppose the government’s plans, nor did he – at this stage – threaten to resign.|$|E

500|$|Skinner and Tyrawley {{agreed that}} the most {{pressing}} threat {{was that of a}} combined land and sea assault focusing on the weakest part of the defences, the open ground between the South Front of the town and Europa Point {{at the end of the}} peninsula. However, they disagreed vehemently over where and how to construct the defences. Tyrawley put a great deal of energy into constructing new earthworks, batteries and a series of retrenched lines between the South Bastion and the New Mole, called the Prince of Wales Lines. It was said of him that he would never let a day pass [...] "without visiting the works once or twice during his stay where there was a possibility of going out." [...] Skinner disagreed with the placement of the new fortifications and criticised the use of compacted earth and sun-baked bricks, which had enabled them to be built at great speed and minimum cost, rather than stone. Skinner perhaps <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>point,</b> as most of Tyrawley's works were washed away by rain within only a few years.|$|E

He {{was not able to}} well accept the proximity of his own demise, and the shadow of impending death instilled great fear in him. He invited a Roman Catholic priest, Father Anselm Strittmatter, O.S.B., to visit him for consultation. Von Neumann reportedly said, [...] "So long as there is the possibility of eternal damnation for nonbelievers it is more logical to be a believer at the end," [...] essentially saying that Pascal <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>point,</b> referring to Pascal's Wager. He had earlier confided to his mother, [...] "There probably has to be a God. Many things are easier to explain if there is than if there isn't." [...] Father Strittmatter administered the last rites to him. Some of von Neumann's friends (such as Abraham Pais and Oskar Morgenstern) said they had always believed him to be [...] "completely agnostic." [...] Of this deathbed conversion, Morgenstern told Heims, [...] "He was of course completely agnostic all his life, and then he suddenly turned Catholic—it doesn't agree with anything whatsoever in his attitude, outlook and thinking when he was healthy." [...] Father Strittmatter recalled that even after his conversion, von Neumann did not receive much peace or comfort from it, as he still remained terrified of death.|$|E

After knocking out Pedro Agosto in four rounds at Pensacola, Florida, Foreman flew to Puerto Rico a day before the fight without giving himself time to acclimatise. His opponent was the skilled boxer Jimmy Young, who had beaten Ron Lyle and lost a very controversial decision to Muhammad Ali the previous year. Foreman fought cautiously early on, allowing Young to settle into the fight. Young constantly complained about Foreman pushing him, for which Foreman eventually <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> deducted by the referee, although Young was never warned for his persistent holding. Foreman badly hurt Young in round 7 but was unable to land a finishing blow. Foreman tired {{during the second half of}} the fight and suffered a knockdown in round 12 en route to losing a decision.|$|E

2500|$|The {{expanded}} {{portion of}} the ode {{is related to the}} ideas expressed in Wordsworth's The Prelude Book V in their emphasis on childhood memories and a connection between the divine and humanity. To Wordsworth, the soul was created by the divine and was able to recognise the light in the world. As a person ages, they are no longer able to see the light, but they can still recognise the beauty in the world. He elaborated on this belief in a note to the text: [...] "Archimedes said that he could move the world if he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>point</b> whereon to rest his machine. Who has not felt the same aspirations as regards the world of his own mind? Having to wield some of its elements when I was impelled to write this poem on the [...] "Immortality of the Soul", I took hold of the notion of pre-existence as having sufficient foundation in humanity for authorising me to make for my purpose the best use I could of it as a Poet." [...] This [...] "notion of pre-existence" [...] is somewhat Platonic in nature, and it is the basis for Wordsworth believing that children are able to be the [...] "best philosopher". The idea was not intended as a type of , the reincarnation of the soul from person to person, and Wordsworth later explained that the poem was not meant to be regarded as a complete philosophical view: [...] "In my Ode... I do not profess to give a literal representation {{of the state of the}} affections and of the moral being in childhood. I record my feelings at that time,--my absolute spirituality, my 'all-soulness,' if I may so speak. At that time I could not believe that I should lie down quietly in the grave, and that my body would moulder into dust." ...|$|E
