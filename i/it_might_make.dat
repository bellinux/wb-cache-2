5|$|Rolling {{a person}} with an active tonic-clonic seizure onto their side and into the {{recovery}} position helps prevent fluids from getting into the lungs. Putting fingers, a bite block or tongue depressor in the mouth is not recommended as <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> the person vomit or result in the rescuer being bitten. Efforts {{should be taken to}} prevent further self-injury. Spinal precautions are generally not needed.|$|E
5|$|A {{major theme}} {{of the game is}} heroism, where being a hero may bring more harm than help. During development, there was a point at the {{beginning}} of the game where players could choose to leave Dubai. This was cut from the game, as the team found it not effective enough, and it broke a player's immersion in the game. According to Williams, the choice system was originally designed to be similar to Fable II, where after a player makes a decision, they cannot reload the game and choose differently unless they start a new game. This was later removed due to the game's structure as a shooter, as the team feared that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> the game unwinnable and cause players to feel frustrated. Williams later added that adding achievements to the game was a mistake, as it disrupts the game's narrative.|$|E

25|$|While {{most years}} China's {{agricultural}} production {{is sufficient to}} feed the country, in down years, China has to import grain. Due to the shortage of available farm land and an abundance of labor, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> more sense to import land-extensive crops (such as wheat and rice) and to save China's scarce cropland for high-value export products, such as fruits, nuts, or vegetables. In order to maintain grain independence and ensure food security, however, the Chinese government has enforced policies that encourage grain production {{at the expense of}} more-profitable crops. Despite heavy restrictions on crop production, China's agricultural exports have greatly increased in recent years.|$|E
25|$|A superstition exists among troops {{about the}} Charms candies {{that come with}} some menus: they are {{considered}} bad luck, especially if actually eaten. Some attribute this to {{a case of a}} dislike becoming a superstition (i.e. not eating them 'just in case' or because <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> one's comrades uneasy). In March 2007, The Salt Lake Tribune invited three gourmet chefs to taste-test 18 MRE meals. None of the meals rated higher than a 5.7 average on a scale of 1-to-10, and the chicken fajita meal, in particular, was singled out for disdain, rating an average score of 1.3. Early in the war in Afghanistan, among the international troops who mingle at Bagram Air Base, a single French combat ration (cassoulet, perhaps, with deer pâté and nougat) could be traded for at least five American Meals Ready to Eat.|$|E

500|$|U.S. Soccer {{was criticized}} after the {{match for the}} secretive bid process that allows teams to outspend their opponents for hosting rights. [...] Both the blind bidding process for hosting tournament matches {{and the manner in}} which MLS teams {{qualified}} for the tournament were widely criticized. [...] An example of the concerns raised around hosting came from FC Dallas midfielder Daniel Hernandez on Twitter, where he complained about Seattle's home-field advantage throughout the 2011 tournament. [...] Following the final, MLS and U.S. Soccer officials met to discuss rule changes to the tournament's host bidding system and team qualification processes. [...] Sounders FC owner Adrian Hanauer commented on the changes and the possibility of raising the profile of the tournament, [...] "I don’t think the bidding process is going to change the profile of the tournament, necessarily. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> a few people happy, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> a few people unhappy. But ultimately, I’m not convinced that’s what is going to raise the profile." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from critics. In the Rolling Stone {{review of the}} album, critic Christian Hoard wrote: [...] "Adam Levine's urban-romantic swoonings work best when his band really gets up on the good foot, as on 'This Love', which uses piano and James Brown-like guitars to create a foundation on which Levine can obsess about beauty (including his own)." [...] Jason Thompson of PopMatters noted that on the songs [...] "This Love" [...] and [...] "Must Get Out", keyboardist Jesse Carmichael [...] "manages to conjure up both the productions of Britney Spears and The New Radicals respectively". Sam Beresky of the Daily Lobo, who was less enthusiastic about the album, complimented the band on [...] "This Love", in which he noted, [...] "...'This Love', is a happier version of the first with a great backbeat reminiscent of Stevie Wonder's 'Superstition'. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> a foot tap, a head nod or even a booty shake if played at a loud volume." ...|$|E
500|$|The Astonishing has {{received}} generally favorable reviews. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream publications, the album holds an average score of 80, based on six reviews. Critics were especially complimentary of the band's willingness {{to write a}} long, unconventional album, with AllMusic commenting, [...] "Dream Theater have invested in the 'album' concept (and in listeners' attention spans) even as the music biz doubles down {{on the notion that}} long-players are merely envelopes to hold singles." [...] Rolling Stone echoed these sentiments, concluding, [...] "The results won't please every Dream Theater partisan, nor will they convert the skeptical. But it would take a hard heart to deny Petrucci, co-composer and keyboardist Jordan Rudess and their mates credit for the boldness of their aspirations and the assurance with which they achieve them." [...] Loudwire was also supportive of the band's unique approach, but warned that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> the album polarizing for fans.|$|E

500|$|In 1982 El Salvador took a 20-man squad (two players {{short of}} the normal 22, as a {{controversial}} cost–saving measure), coached by the aforementioned Mauricio [...] "Pipo" [...] Rodríguez, to Spain. The team's experience was an unhappy one. In their first match on June 15 in Elche, they were defeated 10–1 by Hungary, a scoreline that stands as a World Cup record to this day. A silver lining was that Luis Baltazar Ramírez Zapata scored the country's first World Cup goal during the game, albeit at a point when the Salvadorans were already down 5–0. It was cold comfort however. When Zapata scored against Hungary, some Salvadorans cried out to Zapata not to celebrate the goal effusively because <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> the Hungarians angry {{and encourage them to}} score more. El Salvador managed to regain some pride in their subsequent games. Displaying much-improved levels of organisation and commitment, they lost 1–0 to Belgium on June 19 in Elche and 2–0 to the then-reigning world champions, Argentina, in Alicante on June 23.|$|E
500|$|A {{number of}} Hollywood studios had {{contacted}} George R.R. Martin about possible adaptation {{of his book}} series A Song of Ice and Fire into a film, however Martin expressed the opinion the books could not {{be made into a}} film as too much would have to be cut from the books, but thought it could be made into a television series. In January 2006, David Benioff spoke to Martin's literary agent about the books he represented for possible adaption, and the agent sent the first four books of A Song of Ice and Fire to David Benioff. Benioff read a few hundred pages of the first book in the series, A Game of Thrones, called D. B. Weiss and said: [...] "Maybe I'm crazy, but I haven't had this much fun reading anything in about 20 years. So take a look because I think <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> a great HBO series." [...] Weiss, who then read the first book in two days, was very enthusiastic about a possible television project based on the books. They arranged a meeting with Martin, who asked them if they knew who Jon Snow’s real mother might be, and was satisfied with their answer.|$|E
500|$|James W. Springer of Northern Illinois University {{reviewed}} Arens' {{book for}} Anthropological Quarterly. He {{hoped that the}} book would in part have a positive legacy, in that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> anthropologists look more closely and critically at their source material, and praised its criticism of the claims regarding Aztec cannibalism. He nevertheless proclaimed that Arens was [...] "almost certainly wrong", making use of faulty evaluation methods and being excessively critical of any and all claims for cultural cannibalism, failing to prove dishonesty or prejudice on the behalf of Europeans who have claimed evidence for cultural cannibalism. He criticises both Arens' treatment of Staden's claims and his discussion of Iroquois cannibalism, claiming that Arens has neglected to mention many Native American first-hand testaments as to the cannibalistic nature of these people. Ultimately, he dismissively asserted that The Man-Eating Myth [...] "does not advance our knowledge of cannibalism." [...] More favourably, R.E. Downs of the University of New Hampshire reviewed the work for American Ethnologist. Noting that the book was [...] "provocative" [...] in its thesis, he {{felt that it was}} bound to raise many [...] "hackles", and that it would lead future anthropologists to challenge other long-standing beliefs about non-western [...] "primitive" [...] societies, such as that of widespread incest and promiscuity. [...] Ultimately, he remarked that while many anthropologists might dispute Arens' ideas, never again could they claim that the existence of cultural cannibalism was an undisputed fact.|$|E

2500|$|These {{technological}} possibilities enabled nuclear {{strategy to}} develop a logic considerably different from previous military thinking. Because {{the threat of nuclear}} warfare was so awful, it was first thought that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> any war of the future impossible. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's doctrine of [...] "massive retaliation" [...] {{in the early years of}} the Cold War was a message to the USSR, saying that if the Red Army attempted to invade the parts of Europe not given to the Eastern bloc during the Potsdam Conference (such as West Germany), nuclear weapons would be used against the Soviet troops and potentially the Soviet leaders.|$|E

After discussions at the 2011 Comic-Con with Uziel and Mortal Kombat creator Ed Boon, Tancharoen said to expect an origin story in the style of Rebirth and Legacy as opposed to the traditional Mortal Kombat mythology. He said, [...] "I've always been a fan of properties like Batman where you can expand the universe in different directions. Mortal Kombat is big enough that you can allow for multiple different kinds of storytelling."

2500|$|Peter Tyler, though, puts {{forward a}} number of {{coherent}} objections to this line of enquiry. Firstly, as he points out, these metaphors, while present in certain Islamic sources {{in other parts of}} the Muslim world, are not always prominent in the Andalucian and North African Islamic sources. Secondly, in any case, John is using them in different ways from the Islamic sources. Thirdly, and crucially, there seems to have been little cultural interplay between Islamic culture and Christian culture in Spain by the late sixteenth century, with sources existing in different languages, not being translated, and of course all Muslims already having been forced to leave Spain. Rather, Tyler concludes, there [...] "are sufficient Christian medieval antecedents for many of the metaphors John employs to suggest we should look for Christian sources rather than Muslim sources". As José Nieto indicates, in trying to locate a link between Spanish Christian mysticism and Islamic mysticism, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>make</b> more sense to refer to the common Neo-Platonic tradition and mystical experiences of both, rather than seek direct influence.|$|E
