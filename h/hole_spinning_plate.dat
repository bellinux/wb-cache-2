40|$|A <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> is a {{potential}} solid-state q-bit, {{that may be more}} robust against nuclear spin induced dephasing than an electron spin. Here we propose and demonstrate the sequential preparation, control and detection of a single <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> trapped on a self-assembled InGaAs/GaAs quantum dot. The dot is embedded in a photodiode structure under an applied electric field. Fast, triggered, initialization of a <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> is achieved by creating a spin-polarized electron-hole pair with a picosecond laser pulse, and in an applied electric field, waiting for the electron to tunnel leaving a spin-polarized hole. Detection of the <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> with picoseconds time resolution is achieved using a second picosecond laser pulse to probe the positive trion transition, where a trion is created conditional on the <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> being detected as a change in photocurrent. Finally, using this setup we observe a Rabi rotation of the hole-trion transition that is conditional on the <b>hole</b> <b>spin,</b> which for a pulse area of 2 pi can be used to impart a phase shift of pi between the <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> states, a non-general manipulation of the <b>hole</b> <b>spin.</b> (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{experiments on}} the initialisation, coherent control, and readout {{of a single}} <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> trapped in a self assembled InGaAs semiconductor quantum dot. High fidelity initialisation of a <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> state is achieved by the fast ionisation of a spin polarised neutral exciton under an applied electric field and in a Faraday geometry magnetic field. The preparation of a coherent superposition state is demonstrated by observing the precession of the <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> about a Voigt geometry magnetic field. The <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> dephasing time is deduced from the decay of the spin contrast. Coherent optical rotation of the <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> state about the z-axis is demonstrated using the geometric phase shift induced by a picosecond laser pulse. By combining the precession of the spin about the x-axis, and optical rotations about the z-axis, full quantum control of a <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> is demonstrated {{over the surface of}} the Bloch sphere.

40|$|We {{directly}} {{measure the}} <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> lifetime in ferromagnetic GaMnAs via time- and polarization-resolved spectroscopy. Below the Curie temperature Tc, an ultrafast photoexcitation with linearly-polarized light {{is shown to}} create a non-equilibrium <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> population via the dynamical polarization of holes through p-d exchange scattering with ferromagnetically-ordered Mn spins, and we characterize their relaxation dynamics. The observed relaxation consists of a distinct three-step recovery : (i) femtosecond (fs) <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> relaxation ~ $ 160 - 200 fs, (ii) picosecond (ps) hole energy relaxation ~ 1 - 2 ps, and (iii) a coherent, damped Mn spin precession with a period of ~ 250 ps. The transient amplitude of the <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> component diminishes with increasing temperature, directly following the ferromagnetic order, while the hole energy amplitude shows negligible temperature change, consistent with our interpretation.

In our calculation, the screening constant, playing {{an important role in the}} <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> relaxation, is treated with the random phase approximation. In intrinsic GaAs, our result shows good agreement with the experiment data at room temperature, where the <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> relaxation is demonstrated to be dominated by the Elliott-Yafet mechanism. We also find that the <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> relaxation strongly depends on the temperature and predict a valley in the density dependence of the <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> relaxation time at low temperature due to the hole-electron scattering. In $p$-type GaAs, we predict a peak in the spin relaxation time against the hole density at low temperature, which originates from the distinct behaviors of the screening in the degenerate and nondegenerate regimes. The competition between the screening and the momentum exchange during scattering events can also lead to a valley in the density dependence of the <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> relaxation time in the low density regime. At high temperature, the effect of the screening is suppressed due to the small screening constant.

Using undoped, coupled quantum wells (QWs), we examine this anisotropy by comparing the <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> dynamics for high- and low-symmetry crystallographic orientations of the QWs. We directly measure the hole $g$ factor via time-resolved Kerr rotation, and for the low-symmetry crystallographic orientations (110) and (113 a), we observe a large in-plane anisotropy of the hole $g$ factor, in good agreement with our theoretical calculations. Using resonant spin amplification, we also observe an anisotropy of the <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> dephasing in the (110) -grown structure, indicating that crystal symmetry {{may be used to}} control <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> dynamics...|$|R
40|$|We {{revisit the}} {{paradigm}} of the dependency of jet power on black <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> in accreting black hole systems. In a previous paper we showed that the luminosity of compact jets continuously launched due to accretion onto black holes in X-ray binaries (analogous to those that dominate the kinetic feedback from AGN) {{do not appear to}} correlate with reported black <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> measurements. It is therefore unclear whether extraction of the black <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> energy is the main driver powering compact jets from accreting black holes. Occasionally, black hole X-ray binaries produce discrete, transient (ballistic) jets for a brief time over accretion state changes. Here, we quantify the dependence of the power of these transient jets (adopting two methods to infer the jet power) on black <b>hole</b> <b>spin,</b> making use of all the available data in the current literature, which includes 12 BHs with both measured spin parameters and radio flares over the state transition. In several sources, regular, well-sampled radio monitoring has shown that the peak radio flux differs dramatically depending on the outburst (up to a factor of 1000) whereas the total power required to energise the flare may only differ by a factor ~< 4 between outbursts. The peak flux is determined by the total energy in the flare and the time over which it is radiated (which can vary considerably between outbursts). Using a Bayesian fitting routine we rule out a statistically significant positive correlation between transient jet power measured using these methods, and current estimates of black <b>hole</b> <b>spin.</b> Even when selecting subsamples of the data that disregard some methods of black <b>hole</b> <b>spin</b> measurement or jet power measurement, no correlation is found in all cases.
