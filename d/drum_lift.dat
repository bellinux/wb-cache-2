50|$|A <b>drum</b> <b>lift</b> is {{a passage}} in which singing is backed only by the drums and no other music. It is not {{normally}} considered a solo, as the primary focus remains on the singing; however, it bears some similarity to a solo. A <b>drum</b> <b>lift</b> may be set or improvised, simple or elaborate, and may vary in length from part of a line to an entire verse.|$|E
50|$|Below-hook drum handler is {{commonly}} used to lift, tilt and pour drums. It is made with premium grade stainless steel and features hydraulic powered lifting mechanism with chain puller. It features a grip which holds the drum below the third ribbing or underneath. It also has lifting eyes or fork packets for added support. Examples of below-hook drum handler are drum pourers and <b>drum</b> <b>lift</b> carriers.|$|E
25|$|Dum Dum is also {{notable for}} being another song in Butthole Surfers' {{catalogue}} {{to be based}} around parts of a Black Sabbath song although the lyrics revolve around an entirely different concept from the original. Specifically, the <b>drums</b> are <b>lifted</b> from Children of the Grave, from the Master of Reality album.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} adjust shearer drum swiftly and {{precisely}} {{to adapt to}} the changes of coal seam, a compound control approach based on cerebellar model articulation control and fractional order PID controller was proposed. As the movement precision and response speed of hydraulic system were determined mainly by the control precision of valve-controlled asymmetrical hydraulic cylinder, its working principle and characteristics were analyzed in this paper, with particular focusing on the asymmetry problem. Furthermore, RBF neural network was applied to obtaining reasonable tuning parameters and a control algorithm of proposed controller was designed. Finally, laboratory experiments were developed to verify the validity and effectiveness of proposed compound control method. The testing results, compared with those for other controllers, proved that the proposed compound control method can acquire high movement precision and respond speed in the system of hydraulically driven shearer <b>drum</b> <b>lifting</b> with different control conditions...|$|R
50|$|The Lily {{features}} a Flemish brake design which incorporates a rope <b>drum</b> which <b>lifts</b> a loaded lever {{which in turn}} pulls a set of wooden blocks tightly around the windshaft (the shaft the sails are mounted on). This brake design {{which is similar to}} a band brake is very effective when the sails are facing the wind, but much less so when the wind is coming from behind. For this reason a ‘kneppel’ is installed which prevents counter-rotation of the sails when the windmill has stopped.|$|R
50|$|It {{is assumed}} that the column <b>drums</b> were <b>lifted</b> by cranes into their place. Ancient sources, {{as well as a}} {{substantial}} body of archaeological evidence, show that Roman engineers were capable of raising large weights clear off the ground. The typical drum of Trajan's Column weighs c. 32 t, while the capital, the heaviest block above the base and pedestal, is even at 53.3 t, which had to be lifted 34 m high. To save weight, the treads had probably been carved out before either at the quarry or in situ.|$|R
50|$|Most washer dryer {{combination}} {{units are}} of the front-loading design. This allows for easier access, better efficiency, and more effective washes than top-loading designs. Instead of just leaving the clothes to soak in the water throughout the entire wash, like a top-loading machine would do, the front-loading design tilts the drum on its side, so that {{the contents of the}} <b>drum</b> are repeatedly <b>lifted</b> {{in and out of the}} water throughout the wash cycle.|$|R
500|$|In 1983–84, the duo {{recorded}} twelve {{songs with}} Orlando, at Unique Studios in New York, [...] "West End Girls", [...] "Opportunities (Let's Make Lots of Money)", [...] "One More Chance", [...] "I Want a Lover", [...] "Thats My Impression", [...] "A Man Could Get Arrested", [...] "I Get Excited", [...] "Two Divided by Zero", [...] "Rent", [...] "It's A Sin", [...] "Pet Shop Boys", and [...] "Later Tonight". Orlando played {{most of the}} instruments on [...] "West End Girls", including the jazz riff at the end. Lowe played one chord and the bassline. It included a <b>drum</b> part <b>lifted</b> from Michael Jackson's [...] "Billie Jean", and an arrangement involving what Tennant called [...] "Barry White chords". Orlando was thrilled by the song's production; his idea {{was to make a}} rap record in a British accent.|$|R
25|$|Drones are the Overlord's workers: {{although}} {{they do not have}} enhanced senses or any defense, these workers who maintain and run the Meat Factory (and presumably other Overlord facilities) are super-strong; they <b>lift</b> <b>Drum</b> without strain. They are only found in Overlord installations, where there are invariably others nearby to defend them. A standard size of Drone groups is not mentioned in the book, although when Ella, Ninde, and Gold-Eye infiltrated the Meat Factory, they met a pair of them together.|$|R
50|$|Disputes with Verlaine led to Hell's {{departure}} from Television in 1975, and he co-founded the Heartbreakers with New York Dolls guitarist Johnny Thunders. Hell {{did not last}} long with this band, and began recruiting members for a new one. For guitarists Hell found Robert Quine and Ivan Julian—Quine had worked in a bookstore with Hell, and Julian responded to an advertisement in the The Village Voice. They <b>lifted</b> <b>drummer</b> Marc Bell from Wayne County. The band was named the Voidoids after a novel Hell had been writing.|$|R
5000|$|The Guardian writer Dom Lawson {{gave the}} album {{a rating of}} four stars out of five, and wrote, [...] "Plainly {{intended}} to be definitive, their 10th album stays true to the scything, mid-paced attack that had such an impact on fledgling extreme metal in the late 80s, but in contrast to 2014's Inked in Blood, this is no perfunctory delivering of familiar goods. Latest recruits Kenny Andrews (lead guitar) and Terry Butler (bass) have brought renewed focus to both songwriting and sound: the former's blistering, old-school solos are uniformly stunning and Butler's chemistry with <b>drummer</b> Donald Tardy <b>lifts</b> the likes of breakneck opener Brave to levels of intensity that Obituary haven't reached for years." ...|$|R
50|$|Q-11 was {{received}} in 55-gallon drums. The drums were deheaded before processing and were conveyed through a thawing tunnel, which also provided surge capacity of deheaded drums. The <b>drums</b> were <b>lifted</b> {{to the top}} of the building by a skip hoist where they were emptied into a surge hopper that feeds the magnetic separator and jaw crusher. From the jaw crusher, the one-half inch material passes through a rotary drum dryer to a system of conveyors, which conveys the material to a surge hopper that feeds the ring roll mill. The particle size output from the mill was controlled to about 100 mesh by an air classifier mounted directly on the mill. The undersized material was blown to a cyclone separator that was mounted directly above the first Gallagher sampler. The three Gallagher samplers in series each took a 10% cut of the stream fed to it, producing a sample approximately 0.1% of the original lot size. The main stream was conveyed to a drumming station where it was packaged in 55-gallon or 30-gallon drums for use in the Refinery. The official weight was taken at this point.|$|R
50|$|During {{extraction}} of drums {{from the bottom}} of the pools, an accident occurred that might have cost two workers' lives. After the left-hand pool was covered with protective lids, cleanup workers cut windows inside them with torches in order to feed in a capturing device that <b>lifted</b> <b>drums</b> from the bottom. The windows were covered with iron sheets to protect the workers from radiation and prevent them from falling in. During this work, one of the workers, a starshina 1st stage, inadvertently stepped onto an iron sheet covering one of the windows. The sheet failed to support his weight, and they both fell into the pool's radioactive water. As the worker fell, his legs got caught under some nuclear waste drums, and the water splashed onto the others, who also did not have radiation protection equipment.|$|R
50|$|The pit {{was put up}} {{for sale}} in 1889 and the {{prospectus}} states that it had four shafts, two of which were sunk {{to a depth of}} 570 ft. The winding shaft was 9 ft in diameter, walled throughout and had two separate cages. The winding engine was a Boulton and Watt, had a 4 ft 6in stroke, a 12 ft <b>drum</b> and could <b>lift</b> 700 to 800 tons of coal a day. The pumping engine had two 19in cylinders and was in working order. Above ground was a bank high enough for double screens which sorted the coal before it was loaded for transportation. A tunnel was provided {{at the bottom of the}} bank to enable timber and other materials to descend into the pit without first being hauled to the top. A 100 ft high circular chimney stack towered over the colliery.|$|R
6000|$|There was an inlaid ivory door, set in lintel and posts crusted with looking-glass--all {{apparently}} old work. This {{opened into}} a darkened room {{where there were}} gilt and silver charpoys, and portraits, in the native fashion, of the illustrious dead of Boondi. Beyond the darkness was a balcony clinging to the sheer side of the Palace, {{and it was then}} that the Englishman realised to what a height he had climbed without knowing it. He looked down upon the bustle of the Treasury and the stream of life flowing {{into and out of the}} Gate of the Fishes where the big <b>drums</b> lie. <b>Lifting</b> his eyes, he saw how Boondi City had built itself, spreading from west to east as the confined valley became too narrow and the years more peaceable. The Boondi hills are the barrier that separates the stony, uneven ground near Deoli from the flats of Kotah, twenty miles away. From the Palace balcony the road to the eye is clear to the banks of the Chumbul River, which was the Debatable Ford in times gone by and was leaped, as all rivers with any pretensions to a pedigree have been, by more than one magic horse. Northward and easterly the hills run out to Indurgarh, and southward and westerly to territory marked [...] "disputed" [...] on the map in the present year of grace. From this balcony the Raja can see to the limit of his territory eastward, his empire all under his hand. He is, or the Politicals err, that same Ram Singh who was installed by Tod in 1821, and for whose success in killing his first deer, Tod was, by the Queen-Mother of Boondi, bidden to rejoice. To-day the people of Boondi say: [...] "This Durbar is very old; so old that few men remember its beginning, for that was in our father's time." [...] It is related also of Boondi that, on the occasion of the Queen's Jubilee, they said proudly that their ruler had reigned for sixty years, and he was a man. They saw nothing astonishing in the fact of a woman having reigned for fifty. History does not say whether they jubilated; for there are no Englishmen in Boondi to write accounts of demonstrations and foundation-stone laying to the daily newspaper, and Boondi is very, very small. In the early morning you may see a man pantingly chased out of the city by another man with a naked sword. This is the mail and the mail-guard; and the effect is as though runner and swordsman lay under a doom--the one to fly with the fear of death always before him, as men fly in dreams, and the other to perpetually fail of his revenge.|$|R
