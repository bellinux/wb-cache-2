25|$|In {{the poem}} Lokasenna, where Loki accuses nearly every female in {{attendance}} of promiscuity or unfaithfulness, an aggressive exchange occurs between Loki and Freyja. The {{introduction to the}} poem notes that among other gods and goddesses, Freyja attends a celebration held by Ægir. In verse, after Loki has flyted with the goddess Frigg, Freyja interjects, telling Loki that he is insane for dredging up his terrible deeds, and that Frigg knows the fate of everyone, though she does not tell it. Loki tells her to be silent, and says that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> about herthat Freyja is not lacking in blame, {{for each of the}} gods and elves in the hall have been her lover. Freyja objects. She says that Loki is lying, that he is just looking to blather about misdeeds, and since the gods and goddesses are furious at him, he can expect to go home defeated. Loki tells Freyja to be silent, calls her a malicious witch, and conjures a scenario where Freyja was once astride her brother when all of the gods, laughing, surprised the two. Njörðr interjectshe says that a woman having a lover other than her husband is harmless, and he points out that Loki has borne children, and calls Loki a pervert. The poem continues in turn.|$|E

[...] He also compared Carlsen to Boris Spassky in his prime, and stated that [...] "Magnus can literally do almost everything." [...] Kasparov expressed similar sentiments: [...] " [...] {{has the ability to}} correctly evaluate any position, which only Karpov could boast of before him." ...|$|E
500|$|Pitt had {{the lead}} role in 1998's fantasy romance film Meet Joe Black. He portrayed a {{personification}} of death inhabiting {{the body of a}} young man to learn {{what it is like to}} be human. The film received mixed reviews, and many were critical of Pitt's performance. According to Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle, Pitt was unable to [...] "make an audience believe that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> the mysteries of death and eternity." [...] Roger Ebert stated [...] "Pitt is a fine actor, but this performance is a miscalculation." ...|$|E

500|$|As Obama {{lived in}} Hyde Park, a more {{affluent}} neighborhood {{with a higher}} percentage of White voters {{than the rest of the}} district, the narrative of the race became [...] "the Black Panther against the professor" [...] Obama frequently came off as uptight. Rush criticized Obama: [...] "Barack Obama went to Harvard and became an educated fool. We’re not impressed with these folks with these Eastern elite degrees. Barack is a person who read about the civil-rights protests and thinks <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> about it." [...] Trotter said, [...] "Barack is viewed in part to be the white man in blackface in our community." [...] Though the Chicago Tribune endorsed Obama, many, including local officials, President Bill Clinton, and Vice President Al Gore, the Democratic Party nominee for President, endorsed Rush.|$|E
500|$|Small Time Crooks starred Grant, in {{the words}} of film critic Andrew Sarris, as [...] "a petty, petulant, faux-Pygmalion art dealer, David, [...] is one of the sleaziest and most unsympathetic {{characters}} Mr. Allen has ever created." [...] In a role devoid of his comic attributes, the New York Times wrote: [...] "Mr. Grant deftly imbues his character with exactly a perfect blend of charm and nasty calculation." [...] A year later, his turn as a charming but womanising book publisher Daniel Cleaver in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) was proclaimed by Variety to be [...] "as sly an overthrow of a star's polished posh – and nice – poster image as any comic turn in memory". The film, adapted from Helen Fielding's novel of the same name, was an international hit, earning $281million worldwide. Grant was, according to the Washington Post, fitting as [...] "a cruel, manipulative cad, hiding behind the male god's countenance that <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> too well".|$|E

After the newspapers begin reporting {{the emergence of a new}} Spider-Man, Aaron deduces that it is really Miles, and offers to train Miles and work with him.

2500|$|The church {{encourages}} {{all people}} to pray often [...] "for the evil spirit teacheth {{not a man}} to pray, but teacheth him that he must not pray." [...] In LDS scripture Jesus tells his disciples, [...] "Ye shall call upon the Father in my name." [...] Prayer is viewed a means of communication between man and God.

They paid regularly to support the Jewish institutions (such as the rabbinical academy of Jerusalem). A significant number of their ministers and counselors were Jews. The Abbasids too similarly were respectful and tolerant towards the Jews under their rule. Benjamin of Tudela, a famous 12th-century Jewish explorer, described the Caliph al-Abbasi as a [...] "great king and kind unto Israel". Benjamin also further goes on to describe about al-Abassi that [...] "many belonging to the people of Israel are his attendants, <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>all</b> languages and is well-versed in the Law of Israel.
