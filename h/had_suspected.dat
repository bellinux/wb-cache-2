5|$|In 1687, Sir Isaac Newton {{published}} his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, {{in which he}} outlined his laws of gravity and motion. His work on comets was decidedly incomplete. Although he <b>had</b> <b>suspected</b> that two comets that had appeared in succession in 1680 and 1681 were the same comet before and after passing behind the Sun (he was later found to be correct; see Newton's Comet), {{he was unable to}} completely reconcile comets into his model.|$|E
5|$|The second {{follow-up}} study {{was done in}} 1998 by Kitayama and Uchida. They sought to investigate {{the relationship between a}} person's name-letter effect and his or her birthday-number effect, given that Kitayama and Karasawa <b>had</b> <b>suspected</b> a single driving force behind both. As they had predicted, Kitayama and Uchida found that within a person the two effects were correlated. Later studies confirmed this finding.|$|E
5|$|Gilmore <b>had</b> <b>suspected</b> that C. fragilis and C. agilis {{were the}} same, but Ostrom {{was able to}} {{demonstrate}} this synonymy. This greatly expanded the known material pertaining to C. fragilis, and Ostrom was able to demonstrate that Ornitholestes was quite different from Coelurus. At the time, Dale Russell had proposed that C. agilis was a species of Elaphrosaurus based on the incomplete information then published; Ostrom was also able to demonstrate {{that this was not}} the case. Additionally, he showed that one of the three vertebrae Marsh had illustrated for C. fragilis was actually a composite of two vertebrae, one of which was later shown to come from another quarry and belonged not to Coelurus but to another, unnamed small theropod. This unnamed genus would not be the last small theropod from the Morrison Formation to be confused with Coelurus; a later discovery (1995) of a partial skeleton in Wyoming was first thought to be a new larger specimen of Coelurus, but further study showed it belonged to a different but related genus, Tanycolagreus.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, {{thinking}} that the Garza murder {{had taken place in}} San Antonio because Feit had trained there, Tacheny called authorities in that city and said that he could no longer keep the secret of Feit's confession. The investigation into Garza's death was reopened that year. Texas Rangers investigator Rudy Jaramillo contacted Father Joseph O'Brien, a priest who worked with Feit {{at the time of the}} Garza murder. O'Brien told a television program in 2000 that he did not know anything about Garza's death. He softened with Jaramillo, first telling the investigator that he <b>had</b> <b>suspected</b> Feit at the time, then admitting that Feit had confessed shortly after the murder. In August 2002, the polygraph examiner who tested Feit in 1960 said that he questioned the reported results. Feit had been said to have passed his polygraph and documentation was later amended to show that the results were inconclusive, but the examiner felt that Feit had failed the test.|$|E
5|$|As Alcibiades <b>had</b> <b>suspected,</b> {{his absence}} emboldened his enemies, {{and they began}} to accuse him of other sacrilegious actions and {{comments}} and even alleged that these actions were connected with a plot against the democracy. According to Thucydides, the Athenians were always in fear and took everything suspiciously. When the fleet arrived in Catana, it found the state trireme Salaminia waiting to bring Alcibiades and the others indicted for mutilating the hermai or profaning the Eleusinian Mysteries back to Athens to stand trial. Alcibiades told the heralds that he would follow them back to Athens in his ship, but in Thurii he escaped with his crew; in Athens he was convicted in absentia and condemned to death. His property was confiscated and a reward of one talent was promised to whoever succeeded in killing any who had fled. Meanwhile, the Athenian force in Sicily, after a few early victories, moved against Messina, where the Generals expected their secret allies within the city to betray it to them. Alcibiades, however, foreseeing that he would be outlawed, gave information to the friends of the Syracusans in Messina, who succeeded in preventing the admission of the Athenians. With the death of Lamachus in battle some time later, command of the Sicilian Expedition fell into the hands of Nicias, whom modern scholars have judged to be an inadequate military leader.|$|E
5|$|Six {{months after}} the events of , protagonist George Stobbart and his girlfriend, Nicole Collard, visit an {{archaeologist}} named Professor Oubier to learn about a mysterious Mayan stone Nico uncovered while researching a newspaper story. At Oubier's home, they are ambushed by two Central Americans, who kidnap Nico, tie George to a chair and set the building ablaze. George unties himself and puts out the fire. He contacts Andre Lobineau, who reveals that Nico <b>had</b> <b>suspected</b> that something would go wrong and had left the stone with him. Lobineau tells him of a gallery owner who can tell him more about Mayan art. George discovers that Oubier supplies the gallery with Mayan artifacts, which he imports through a company named Condor Transglobal. Following this lead, George finds the two Central Americans who kidnapped Nico. One of them, whose name is later revealed to be Pablo, is shown threatening and berating the other (later revealed to be called Titipoco). George knocks Pablo unconscious and discovers that Condor Transglobal has links with Quaramonte City in Central America. He also frees Titipoco, who had been manacled by Pablo. George finds Nico, who reveals that, while trying to expose a drug ring run {{by a man named}} Karzac, she was sent the stone instead, prompting her to arrange the appointment with Oubier.|$|E

25|$|In 1989, {{the media}} {{reported}} a sting operation and political scandal, codenamed Midnight Jackal, in which {{former members of}} ISI hatched a plan to topple the Bhutto government. Midnight Jackal was a political intelligence operation launched under President Ghulam Ishaq Khan and army chief General Mirza Aslam Beg, whose objective was to pass a no-confidence motion in Parliament by bribing and threatening parliament members.
