5000|$|Accordingly, Charles V {{considered}} {{it necessary to}} renew and confirm the Jews' charter. At the same time these rights and privileges were extended to the Jews of the whole empire. Nobody {{was to have the}} right to close their schools and synagogues, to drive them out or hinder their use. Whoever violated the imperial constitutio pacis by infringing upon the rights of the Jews was to be punished by every authority. Every Jew was {{to have the right to}} do business in the empire and every authority was to protect him and not burden him with tolls or duties. Jews were not required to wear [...] "Jewish insignias" [...] outside of their dwellings and no Jew was to be driven from his home without the emperor's expressed consent. Because Jews paid higher taxes but had no public offices, real estate or manual trade, they were allowed to charge higher interest rates than the Christians. It was forbidden to accuse Jews of using Christian blood without <b>due</b> <b>proof</b> and witness, to take them prisoner, to torture or to execute them. Infringements of this privilege were to be fined with 50 marks in gold, one half to be paid to the emperor and the other to the Jewish community.In 1548 this charter was once more confirmed by Charles V and again by emperor Maximilian II in 1566.|$|E

40|$|Stress rupture {{failure of}} Carbon Composite Overwrapped Pressure Vessels (COPVs) is of serious concern to Science Mission and Constellation {{programs}} {{since there are}} a number of COPVs on board space vehicles with stored gases under high pressure for long durations of time. It has become customary to establish the reliability of these vessels using the so called classic models. The classical models are based on Weibull statistics fitted to observed stress rupture data. These stochastic models cannot account for any additional damage due to the complex pressure-time histories characteristic of COPVs being supplied for NASA missions. In particular, it is suspected that the effects of proof test could significantly reduce the stress rupture lifetime of COPVs. The focus of this paper is to present an analytical appraisal of a model that incorporates damage <b>due</b> to <b>proof</b> test. The model examined in the current paper is based on physical mechanisms such as micromechanics based load sharing concepts coupled with creep rupture and Weibull statistics. For example, the classic model cannot accommodate for damage <b>due</b> to <b>proof</b> testing which every flight vessel undergoes. The paper compares current model to the classic model with a number of examples. In addition, several applications of the model to current ISS and Constellation program issues are also examined...|$|R
