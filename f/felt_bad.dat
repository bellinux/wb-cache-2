5|$|From the {{day that}} Speaker arrived in Cleveland, manager Lee Fohl rarely made an {{important}} move without consulting him. George Uhle recalled an incident from 1919 during his rookie year with the Indians. Speaker often signaled to Fohl when he thought that a pitcher should be brought in from the bullpen. One day, Fohl misread Speaker's signal and brought in a different pitcher than Speaker had intended. To avoid the appearance of overruling his manager, Speaker let the change stand. Pitcher Fritz Coumbe lost the game, Fohl resigned that night and Speaker became manager. Uhle said that Speaker <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> for contributing to Fohl's departure.|$|E

25|$|Applications such as Instagram {{have become}} a “body-image battleground”, while the “selfie” is now the {{universal}} lens in which individuals use to criticise their bodies and others. Facebook and Snapchat also allow users to receive appearance approvals and community acceptance through the ratio of views, comments, and likes. Since individuals who use social media platforms often only display the highpoints of their lives, a survey by Common Sense reported that 22% <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> if their posts were ignored, or {{if it did not}} receive the amount of attention they hoped for. Hence, this could serve as a trigger for more insecurities, with many utilising digital manipulation techniques as well, to modify their photos {{in order to meet the}} media-crafted ideals of thinness and perfection. According to research by the Renfrew Center Foundation, 50% of men and 70% of 18 to 35 year old women edited their images before uploading. Therefore, 35% of respondents were also actively concerned about being tagged in unattractive photos, while 27% fretted about their appearances online. Yet, with the presence of fake imagery, a majority of individuals still habitually fixate on the lifestyles and belongings of others.|$|E

25|$|Strong {{performances}} {{on the tour}} meant that Agassi was quickly tipped as a future Grand Slam champion. While still a teenager, he reached the semifinals of both the French Open and the US Open in 1988 and made the US Open semifinals in 1989. He began the 1990s {{with a series of}} near-misses. He reached his first Grand Slam final in 1990 at the French Open, where he was favored before losing in four sets to Andrés Gómez, which he attributes to worrying about his wig falling off. He reached his second Grand Slam final of the year at the US Open, defeating defending champion Boris Becker in the semifinals. His opponent in the final was Pete Sampras; a year earlier, Agassi had crushed Sampras, after which he told his coach that he <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> for Sampras because he was never going to make it as a pro. Agassi lost the US Open final to Sampras in three sets. The rivalry between these two American players became the dominant rivalry in tennis over the rest of the decade. Also in 1990, Agassi helped the United States win its first Davis Cup in 8 years and won his only Tennis Masters Cup, beating reigning Wimbledon champion Stefan Edberg in the final.|$|E
25|$|In the {{eleventh}} stage, the first mountain {{stage of the}} race, Gino Bartali was away together with French Jean Robic. There {{was a lot of}} crowd, and they pressed forward to see the cyclist coming. This caused Bartali to fall down during the descent of the Col d'Aspin, and this caused Robic to also fall down. Bartali got up and won the stage, but felt threatened by spectators, who punched and kicked him. One spectator had threatened Bartali with a knife. Bartali told his team manager Alfredo Binda that he was leaving the Tour de France, and that all Italian cyclists should abandon the race. Not all Italian cyclists wanted to leave: the members from the second Italian team (the Italian Cadets) and Adolfo Leoni wanted to stay. Some Italian cyclists said they wanted to stay in the race to help Magni defend the leading position. Magni <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> about giving up the chance to win the Tour de France, but accepted the decision. The Tour organisation wanted to keep the Italian cyclists in the race, and among other compromises offered to give them neutral gray jerseys, so the spectators would not recognize them. None of this helped, and both Italian teams left the race. As a consequence, the fifteenth stage, that was originally scheduled to end in Italy (Sanremo), was rescheduled to end in Menton.|$|E

When asked for an opinion on the trade, Uribe commented, [...] "I would've <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> if they traded me to a soccer, basketball or football team. But it's another baseball team, so I'm happy". Uribe's popularity as a Dodger extended past his trade, as a scheduled bobblehead night went ahead as planned after he had left the team for the Braves.|$|E

500|$|The jury began {{deliberations}} on November 17, 2010. Scheduled {{proceedings of}} the case met delays because of increased security at the courthouse. After two days of deliberations, all but one juror had voted to convict Guandique. On the third day, the jury asked Judge Gerald Fisher to clarify the definition of assault. Fisher responded that any physical injury could legally be considered an assault, regardless of how small. On November 22, 2010, the jury found Guandique guilty of both remaining counts of first-degree murder. After the trial, a juror said the testimony of Morales was decisive in reaching the verdict. The conviction was called a [...] "miracle" [...] for having been reached with only circumstantial evidence. Gladys Weatherspoon, who had previously represented Guandique in the 2001 assault cases, stated that she was troubled by the jury's verdict: [...] "I just think {{they were going to}} convict anyway.... They <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> for that woman, the mom. She's sitting in there every day."

500|$|In the {{original}} airing of this episode, Mrs. Krabappel names several different diseases Bart has faked {{in order to}} get out of taking his English test, one of which is Tourette's syndrome. After Bart claims that he is not over it, he begins barking and snarling and mutters, [...] "Shove it, witch!" [...] This scene garnered many complaints from people who thought it was tasteless of the writers to make fun of an actual condition and Joshua Smith, a boy in Renton, Washington began seeking legal action. Smith demanded that they [...] "not repeat the episode and have Bart Simpson befriend somebody with Tourette's on the show" [...] and include an apology from Bart at the end. Executive producer Mike Reiss replied with an apology saying [...] "We kind of feel like we made a mistake this time. We <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> about this." [...] In a move that was unprecedented for the show, the producers agreed to remove the scene from future broadcasts. However, Smith's other requests went unfulfilled. In the version of the episode released on the season four DVD boxset, the part with Bart demonstrating his supposed Tourette's syndrome to Mrs. Krabappel was kept intact, but Krabappel's line about Bart having [...] "...that unfortunate bout of Tourette's syndrome" [...] was replaced with [...] "...that unfortunate bout of rabies." ...|$|E

It’s so rare to have that on a television show, because so often everyone wants you to be the same character every week. It was quite refreshing creatively to get to do that." [...] Referring to Jim and Pam, Denman felt it was [...] "inevitable that Romeo and Juliet had to get together" [...] and end the series' love triangle. [...] "Otherwise," [...] he explained, [...] "it gets kind of tiring and old. I think it was the appropriate time , and I had such a great experience working with all those guys." [...] Denman also added that Daniels' decision stemmed from a desire to advance the Jim–Pam storyline [...] "to the next stage," [...] rather than having anything to do specifically with Denman himself. Denman briefly returned in the series' fifth, seventh, and ninth seasons.|$|E

[...] He reported that he <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> for Liz [...] "because of all the guys [...] has dated over these four seasons, 's the one she should end up with." [...] Sassone hoped the episode would have concluded with the two finding out [...] "something horrible" [...] about Floyd's fiancée [...] "or maybe we'd find out that Floyd did all of this just to get close to Liz again in some weird way". Like Sassone, Time contributor James Poniewozik said that the Floyd character [...] "was one of the better drawn boyfriends for Liz". Further in his recap, Poniewozik was [...] "a little disappointed" [...] that the episode brought him back [...] "to get sloppy drunk, to tell off Liz... and to get engaged to a vapid-seeming 'ab model.'" [...] Television columnist Alan Sepinwall for The Star-Ledger commented that Sudeikis's return gave Tina Fey's Liz [...] "one of her more down-to-earth and relatable stories in a while", and enjoyed the Frank, Toofer, and Lutz rivalry with Jack and Danny, as well as Pete's involvement in the Jenna and Tracy story. Overall, Sepinwall said that the episode did not [...] "really hang together for me." ...|$|E

500|$|Due to Bart's mischievousness and Homer's often uncaring and incompetent behavior, the {{two have}} a {{turbulent}} relationship. Bart regularly addresses Homer by his given name instead of [...] "Dad", while Homer in turn often refers to him as [...] "the boy". Homer has a short temper and when enraged by Bart will strangle him on impulse in a cartoonishly violent manner. One of the original ideas for the show was that Homer would be [...] "very angry" [...] and oppressive toward Bart, but these characteristics were toned down somewhat as their characters were explored. Marge {{is a much more}} caring, understanding and nurturing parent than Homer, but she also refers to Bart as [...] "a handful" [...] and is often embarrassed by his antics. In [...] "Marge Be Not Proud", (season seven, 1995) she felt she was mothering Bart too much and began acting more distant towards him after he was caught shoplifting. At the beginning of the episode, Bart protested at her over-mothering but as her attitude changed, he <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> and made it up to her. Despite his attitude, Bart is sometimes willing to experience humiliation if it means pleasing his mom. Marge has expressed an understanding for her [...] "special little guy" [...] and has defended him on many occasions. She once said [...] "I know Bart can be a handful, but I also know what he's like inside. He's got a spark. It's not a bad thing... Of course, it makes him do bad things." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{deaths of}} Ana Lucia and Libby caused {{speculation}} {{that they were}} killed off due to the DUIs that actresses Michelle Rodriguez and Cynthia Watros received within fifteen minutes of each other on December 1, 2005. Watros pleaded guilty, was fined $370, and had her license suspended for 90 days. Rodriguez initially pleaded innocent, but in April pleaded guilty, {{and was sentenced to}} five days in Oahu correctional facility, but ended up serving only 65 hours due to jail overcrowding. In February 2006, US Weekly claimed that an insider told them that the Lost producers were frustrated with Rodriguez's behavior and were going to kill her character off. Soon after, [...] "Two for the Road" [...] aired, writers Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse told TV Guide that when talking to Rodriguez about the part of Ana Lucia, she said that she would be interested, but only for a year. After sitting down with her, the two were very impressed with her energy, and decided to adjust their plan to make her character only last one season. Since audiences had a negative reaction to Ana-Lucia, the producers thought her death would not generate enough sympathy from fans, so they decided that Libby, who was well liked, should also be killed for emotional impact. [...] Lindelof recalled that after they found out that both Rodriguez and Watros got the DUIs, he was concerned that it would look like killing Ana and Libby was the producers attempt to say [...] "Don't drive drunk!", and even considered re-writing the script so it wouldn't seem that way, but the producers decided just to keep it like it was. Lindelof also denied rumors that Rodriguez was killed off because she was hard to deal with, saying that Michelle was [...] "totally professional and got along well with all the other actors." [...] According to Lindelof and Cuse, Watros was very sad about Libby being killed off, and the producers <b>felt</b> <b>bad</b> for her, so they helped her get in a pilot for a show on CBS called My Ex-Life, although it was not picked up by the network.|$|E
