Compiling circulation statistics is one way of assessing users ’ needs. This project seeks to assess the current collection development practices at Stetson University with respect to the circulation of books purchased in support of selected departmental curricula. Circulation statistics for books selected by five academic departments over a five-year period are compared with those of librarian selections in corresponding subject areas. he process of allocating department and program funding for library materials is a complicated and time-consuming endeavor for acquisitions and collection development librarians in small academic libraries � Although many academic libraries have been able to increase their materials budgets in recent years, these increases have often failed {{to keep pace with the}} rising cost of materials � This <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>buying</b> <b>power</b> impacts libraries’ ability to support the research needs of their users� At {{the root of}} all library acquisition decisions is the goal to add to the collection those materials that will meet users’ needs; compiling usage statistics is an effective way of assessing previous decisions and allows extrapolation for the future � Studies have been conducted to track the use, over time, of a sampling of Debbi Dinkins is Head of Technical Services and Associate Professor at Stetson University; e-mail...|$|E

The {{objective of this}} analysis was to quantitatively and objectively evaluate the decline of vascular surgical reimbursement over the past decade. In this study, data {{for the analysis of}} specific vascular surgical procedures was obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics-National Hospital Discharge Survey (NCHS-NHDS) for all vascular procedures as reported by ICD- 9 -CM codes. The average Medicare reimbursement for each of the specified procedures for 1990 was compared to that of 2001 and the percent change in average reimbursement over this period was calculated. Comparisons between 1990 and 2001 dollar amounts were made after correction for inflation using the consumer price index.

40|$|Food {{retailers}} may enjoy {{market power}} {{by way of}} selling power (ability to control competitors and consumers) and/or <b>buying</b> <b>power</b> (ability to control suppliers). Selling power {{is reflected in the}} market share gains achieved by some distribution channels and groups of enterprises. The double effect of structural factors (consumer behaviour) and economies of scale and scope in terms of logistics, merchandise management and distribution led to the rapid growth of super- and hypermarkets in the past decades and contributed to the emergence of major suburban shopping centres. Market leaders were able to boost their market shares significantly, and the concentration increased, which in turn improved efficiency and accelerated the erosion of the position of neighbourhood shops. High concentration rates in retailing, combined with the structural advantages enjoyed by the retail trade over much of the manufacturing, makes for a substantial potential <b>buying</b> <b>power</b> by the retailer. The extent to which <b>buying</b> <b>power</b> has implications <b>in</b> terms of welfare economics depends very much on the market structures in retailing and manufacturing, but also {{on the extent to which}} competition works at the retailing trade level. Confirmation that the retailing industry has in recent years gained <b>in</b> <b>buying</b> <b>power</b> comes, i. a., from the fact that the main buyers have increased their sales volumes. Their rising <b>buying</b> <b>power</b> is accompanied by a shift of functions from manufacturing industry to retailing industry, larger discounts, insistence on better terms and price and terms negotiations which are largely controlled by the retailing industry. The most efficient method of fighting <b>buying</b> <b>power</b> appears to be the development of strong brands. To a large extent, increasing <b>buying</b> <b>power</b> is also due to intensified competition in the wake of EU membership and structural problems suffered by the manufacturing industry: too small enterprises, excessive production costs, weak brands as a result of the lack of innovation and marketing competence. High concentration rates among food retailers and their resultant market and <b>buying</b> <b>power</b> may be countered only by competitive policy measures (preventive merger control, accompanying supervision to prevent abuse). Structural problems, especially those suffered by small businesses, need to be eliminated within the scope of a structural and industrial policy, with the initiative to be taken by the businesses themselves.
