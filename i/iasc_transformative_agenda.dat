40|$|Advances towards egalitarianism in {{professional}} recruitment may {{be offset by}} processes of occupational re-segregation. Drawing on gender theory this paper investigates horizontal segregation in the UK insolvency profession, as revealed through the lived experiences of female and male practitioners. It is shown that horizontal segregation pervades {{at different levels of}} practice and is undergirded by various elements of gender essentialism. Physical essentialism explains why insolvency practice has been traditionally gendered male. Interactional essentialism combines with the management of work-life balance to define the subfields of corporate and personal insolvency as masculine and feminine respectively. Gender essentialist assumptions also pervade the distribution of roles and the allocation of work tasks. Networks are identified as arenas for the reproduction and perpetuation of occupational segregation. The findings indicate the continuing potency of gender in everyday professional life, the limitations of diversity-orientated policies and the complexities of formulating <b>transformative</b> <b>agendas...</b>|$|R
40|$|To a large extent, if higher {{education}} institutions seek to inscribe themselves within a <b>transformative</b> <b>agenda,</b> this will be done by academics acting as ‘transforming agents’, and by instantiations of transformation both in the curriculum - i. e. in what is being taught in universities, and the knowledge, worldviews, and values that are being conveyed – and in the pedagogies – i. e. the methods, in a broad sense, including techniques, media, and interpersonal approaches - used to communicate this curriculum. In this chapter, we speak from our position as researchers on {{higher education}} in the United Kingdom (UK). From this position, we normatively examine the interplay between epistemologies and identities (knowing and being) in the academy, from this transformational perspective. We propose ways of re-thinking academic practices through a focus on professional learning that cultivates ‘authenticity’, and engagement with curricula and pedagogies that challenge current models in Western universities...|$|R

A qualitative case study methodology was employed to analyse the organisational positioning and design of academic development {{as a means of}} gaining insights into the needs, challenges and evolutionary trends occurring at one university. A non-linear organisational-level data analysis based on triangulation from document study, direct observation, and experiential and reflective knowledge, provided theoretical and practical insights into how academic development is embodied institutionally.

The study concluded that new configurations in the practice of academic development are convergent in nature, integrating a <b>transformative</b> <b>agenda</b> representational of professional learning trends globally.

40|$|This paper {{responds}} to the articles in the recent special edition of The Curriculum Journal (Volume 20, Number 3).

We argue that the papers both raise and omit complex issues {{that need to be}} addressed if their <b>transformative</b> <b>agenda</b> is to be realized. For example, it is important to reconsider traditional assumptions about the nature of knowledge, so that teachers' practice and students' learning can become more appropriately aligned to twenty-first century conditions of knowing and being. Similarly, the wider political contexts that frame practice need to be addressed, in part by rethinking connections between pedagogy, curriculum and assessment to provide a more satisfactory theoretical rationale for competencies and personalization, and by re-theorising related ideas such as ‘equity’. We fear that lack of attention to such issues will simply mean the new pedagogies will continue to reproduce the status quo. ...|$|R

40|$|Initially, a {{group of}} {{scholars}} began to systematically redefine the concept of security {{in a manner that}} directed attention towards the limited opportunity that "military" responses offered to "security" problems. Their primary activity was to redefine security in terms of an expanded idea to "threat," with the implication of these efforts necessarily questioning the appropriateness of military solutions - a politically important position given the thrust of Reaganism at that time. With the emergence of a clear post-positivist trend within IR by the late 1980 s, however, a number of scholars began to address redefinitional efforts along axiological, conceptual and empirical grounds. These latter efforts - herein identified as an Alternative school - yielded important intellectual sanction for political movements, including women's organizations, aboriginal peoples, labour groups, the urban poor and the ecological movement, that often broach ideas of security {{within the context of a}} broader <b>transformative</b> <b>agenda.</b> International relations scholarship is arriving at the point, that is, where the breadth of intellectual activity regarding security reflects its polypolitical imbrications at the global and local levels.

It takes {{the view that the}} existing “digital divide ” mirrors economic, social and political global realities and is not a phenomenon that can be explained in isolation. From this perspective, it makes recommendations for how engaged leadership at all levels can be mobilised to ensure that the digital gap is closed and that ICTs serve development needs. The paper argues that implementation of the <b>transformative</b> <b>agenda,</b> requires public leadership. However, since leadership of the ICTs and development agenda is too important to be left to a single stakeholder, governments must be made accountable to and seek the involvement of civil society including private sector, NGOs, professional associations such as ACCURIL, academic and research institutions. The Caribbean region will not realise benefits of ICTs without improving {{the manner in which it}} engages with global ICT governance and diplomacy.

40|$|Ecologically {{sustainable}} design is a transformative design paradigm {{based on the}} theory of interdependence. This theory requires that the <b>transformative</b> <b>agenda</b> of design is holistic in practice. In effect, the requirement is for value-change {{on the part of}} the designer along with transformation of the built environment. This paper, based on recently completed research into design practice, argues that value-change rests on certainties that are drawn on intuitively while designing, and that this intuitive process is characteristic of design as praxis. It is further argued that design, as praxis, requires a phenomenological approach for inculcating value-change. A phenomenological approach relies on self-reflective practices exemplified by meditation and yoga that can focus on the designer’s ethical know-how. A model for this approach to value-change, the biopsychosocial approach, already exists within clinical medicine. This paper presents findings from interviews with key architects practising self-reflection and/or ecologically {{sustainable design}}. These highlight the premium placed by these architects on both certainty and empathy, and how these values influence design as praxis. Formalising techniques for closer scrutiny of these values will highlight design as praxis. Doing so will critically strengthen ecologically sustainable design as holistic, transformative practice. <br /...|$|R
40|$|The 17 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) bring {{together}} environmental, social, and economic concerns. They therefore {{have the potential}} to move society away from the dominant model of prosperity as purely economic toward a more holistic and ‘sustainable’ prosperity. The success of such a <b>transformative</b> <b>agenda</b> rests on its implementation. At the heart of planned implementation of the SDGs is a set of 242 indicators. Indicators have been strongly critiqued in a range of literatures. However, {{in the context of the}} SDGs, indicators have been described as ‘essential’ with little critical assessment of their role in implementation. Therefore, this chapter aims to provide this critical voice. To do this, the chapter reviews critiques of indicators from sustainability science, anthropology and sociology and provides illustrative cases of indicators implementation. From this review we are able to draw lessons for the use of indicators in SDG implementation. Specifically, the chapter argues that indicators are reductionist and struggle with contested concepts. Nevertheless, by making the operationalisation of concepts visible and enabling quantified analysis, indicators can have a useful role in SDG implementation. However, this requires that indicator critiques are taken seriously and inform indicator use...|$|R
40|$|The {{history of}} the linkage between {{politics}} and education {{is rooted in the}} development of the civil society itself (Adelabu, 2004 : 188). It is based on this understanding that this paper engages how the interaction between education and politics has been impacting on national transformation in Nigeria. From the colonial administration in Nigeria till the contemporary political dispensations, politics has exerted implied or expressed influence on education policies and their implementations. Successive regimes and administrations in Nigeria have seen education, through their manifestoes and actions, as a political tool. The paper focuses on tertiary education as the case study but with some reference to primary and secondary education. Through theoretical understanding of relevant literatures, it is observed in this paper that the inconsistency in the education policies and programmes in Nigeria is as a result of the interplay between politics and education. This paper is therefore of the opinion that relevance and pro-activeness should be the hallmark of education in Nigeria for national transformation. The paper concludes that education in Nigeria can help in the ongoing <b>transformative</b> <b>agenda</b> if the government demonstrates some political will in the implementation of the national education policy...|$|R
40|$|The twist towards having {{narrative}} and story telling methods in social sciences is yielding rich harvest of research conclusions. This method {{is a way}} of vitaii 2 ing the relationship between policy and practice. It is a technique that provides a more meaningful and creative practitioner- service-user relationship and a better understanding of professional sound practices. Being an ocular-centred community, we need to analyse what is happening and to read stores that are close to the reality we are succumbed to. These are stories that transcend from the people to the people, rather than from the researchers/academics to researchers/ academics. Narratives are often intersected by multiple allegiances ranging from a historical context to political conformity, from grass-root struggles to social constructions and cultural hegemonisation, from researcher consent to economic agendas. Maybe the most complex of all issues is not the presentation of stories but to figure out and recognise what constitutes a story, defining story limits, recognising the usefulness of narration and finally reflecting whether the morale of narrations is context-bound. This work is based on the power of stories. This research becomes the process of not only identifying the complex dynamics and snags surrounding the "inclusion" agenda I am engrossed in, but also maps out a way {{to get back on track}} and to come up with answers. The core of my research lies in my semi-fictitious stories that I have written and relocated back to the varied contexts I am involved in using focus groups as my modus operandi. Conversely, this scenario is complemented by autobiographies I assembled from disabled persons, a parent activist and a 'labelled' student. In other words, it is an enmeshment of auto-ethnographic and narrative enquiry. This work has contributed towards an understanding of the ways the stories of children at the margins can be used to promote critical debates about "inclusion". The different perspectives of parent and disabled activists, university students, labelled students, teachers, and social workers - all contexts I am closely involved with, are drawn upon to inform a <b>transformative</b> <b>agenda</b> and to outline practices that enable "inclusion". The work is split into three main portions. The first part includes the Preamble, Introduction and Literature Review and provides us with the main ingredients that have fashioned my thinking. The second part of my Thesis includes the Methods and Methodological issues in depth and the narratives, autobiographies and auto-ethnographic findings that have made up my research base.

40|$|Academic literacies pursues a <b>transformative</b> <b>agenda,</b> which {{involves}} ‘exploring {{alternative ways of}} meaning making in academia, not least by considering the resources that (student) writers bring to the academy as legitimate tools for meaning making’ (Lillis and Scott, 2007 : 13). How we select what the legitimate tools for meaning making are is assumed in these studies, but not established. Given the generally fraught status {{of religion in the}} academy, a perspicuous instance of this problem resides in the question of whether religious faith constitutes a ‘legitimate tool for meaning making’. We therefore need to think about how we establish what can and cannot be said to be legitimate tools, and whether this should be decided as a matter of normative principle, or whether it can be arrived at empirically. Further, we would need to consider how such questions are to be properly incorporated into learning and assessment. This article uses qualitative data from studies into religion and higher education to provide some initial thoughts on how these questions could be addressed. It carries out a scoping exercise that sheds light on the possibilities of the employment of religious identity in academic writing. It concludes that religious ideas and identities may on occasion be relevant without implying a threat to disciplinary rigour...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the rise and}} fall of the Victorian education department&# 039;s learning management system Ultranet. The Ultranet was conceived as a webbased portal that was designed to integrate and deliver on a range of policy objectives in the areas of student management, school networking and communication, and teaching and learning. Heavily promoted by the Victorian educational bureaucracy and the government, the Ultranet, which operated between 2010 and 2013, proved a costly failure and became the subject of an inquiry by Victoria&# 039;s anti-corruption commission. This paper looks beyond the inquiry&# 039;s focus on the conduct of senior departmental officials involved in Ultranet&# 039;s procurement to examine the policy, technological and pedagogical contexts that framed the project. We argue that the project had its roots in pre-digital educational policy settings of devolution and entrepreneurship, which supported a <b>transformative</b> <b>agenda</b> focused on digital information and communication technologies. While the Ultranet software had fatal design and usability flaws, we broaden the scope of analysis to argue that the project rested on problematic assumptions about the digital literacy and connectivity of parents and teachers, and the viability of a technology-based response to risk and privacy embodied in a &# 039;closed&# 039; network, that compromised the venture from its inception...|$|R
