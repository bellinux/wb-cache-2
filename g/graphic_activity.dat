For a while, in the early 1950s, he tried to mediate between Luca and Trost, but unsuccessfully. He was finally allowed to emigrate in the early 1960s, settled in Haifa, and became integrated in Israeli society as a urologist and an artist with several exhibitions both there and in Europe (for example, see Stern). In continuing to draw he moved into full abstraction, his technique seeming to some commentators mysterious or resulting {{from the use of}} supposedly unusual utensils (possibly combs). In reality, all of his work is the result of his mastery of both pencil and pen and ink drawing, combined {{with the use of a}} magnifying glass. A final, self-published, volume of his poetic prose came out in Haifa in 1975. Called La Rose parallèle ("The Parallel Rose"), it is infused with the language of alchemy and Kabbalah mysticism.|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of the}} {{research}} in this paper is the determination of the existing business processes in a company that deals with <b>graphic</b> <b>activity</b> with the possibility of their improvement by applying the TQM (Total Quality Management) methodology, which is closely linked to the financial performance of the company and the satisfaction of all interested sides. In the survey we did there are several main reasons that cause problems in the printing facility and the request of the top management for improving the processes and involvement of competent persons in them is of great importance for the printing company to become world-class. During {{the research}}, which {{was an integral part of}} the TQM methodology several management methods were applied: check list, Pareto diagram, Ishikawa access and benchmarking strategy.

40|$|My curatorial {{project began}} with the {{classification}} of material held at the Eckersley Archive at the London College of Communication. This described Eckerlsey’s career {{in terms of a}} unique combination of four distinct periods of <b>graphic</b> <b>activity.</b> These were itemised in the exhibition catalogue. • As an established member of the poster design community in Britain during the 1930 s and as a contributor to the campaigns of London Transport, Shell and the GPO. • As a pioneer designer of industrial safety propaganda for RoSPA during WW 2. The extension of war propaganda to include welfare issues was a unique characteristic of British Home-Front communications. These established a visual language able to express the high hopes and ideals of political transformation. • As a member of the Alliance Graphique Internationale Tom Eckersley was at the forefront of European efforts to develop a sophisticated visual language able to express ideas beyond the scope of commercial advertising. • As an educationalist at the London College of Printing Tom Eckersley transformed the teaching of graphic design and created a studio laboratory environment dedicated to problem solving in visual communication. The exhibition, catalogue and creation of an online resource were facilitated {{by a grant from the}} AHRC. Related published outputs ('Social Vision' (Eye, volume 13 issue 52 pp 34 - 43, 2004) and ('Eckersley and LCP' (Baseline, number 51 pp 37 - 44, 2007) give more detailed analysis of the second and fourth elements in this classification. A further publication ('Citizenship and Visual Communication') (Renewal, volume 13 number 2 / 3 pp 130 - 139, 2007) describes the contemporary practical potential of Eckerlsey’s contribution to the communication of social messages based on the social communications of WW 2.

40|$|Resumo: Este trabalho tem como proposta uma primeira caracterização do fenômeno até hoje designado, de modo não-sistemático, como "ritmo na escrita" o eixo organizador dessa caracterização, ou, em outros termos, a questão a ser respondida neste trabalho é como, afirmada a éxistência desse fenômeno, o ritmo da escrita opera na produção textual. Na busca de resposta, discute-se, num primeiro momento, o papel do ritmo na linguagem. Nessa discussão, o ritmo é deslocado de sua atuação restrita à oralidade ou ao verso e relacionado, em qualquer tipo de atividade lingüística, à organização multidimensional da linguagem, à significação lingüística, à enunciação e ao tempo na linguagem. Tendo como pano de fundo esse papel central do ritmo na linguagem, são discutidas, num segundo momento, algumas das particularidades com que o ritmo é percebido pelos autores que primeiramente o observam na escrita. Como produto dessa discussão, verifica-se que: (a) o fenômeno é sempre percebido no contexto de discussões sobre os vínculos entre escrita e oralidade; (b) o ritmo vincula escrita e oralidade, mas cada um desses códigos apresenta ritmo peculiar, já que se trata de códigos semióticos distintos; (c) o ritmo constrói o caráter simbólico da escrita por meio da inter-relação entre várias dimensões da linguagem; (d) o ritmo da escrita é recuperado por meio de marcas que espacializam os elementos da linguagem na atividade gráfica, criando entre os elementos espacia lizad os. um mpvimento característico. As marcas escolhidas para análise do ritmo da escrita neste trabalho são os sinais de pontuação. Assim num terceiro momento, checa-se a compatibilidade entre fatos abordados porgramáticos e lingüistas sobre o emprego da pontuação e as principais conclusões extraídas das discussões sobre o papel do ritmo na linguagem e sobre sua ação na escrita. Finalmente, num quarto momento, é demonstrado o papel do ritmo da escrita por meio da análise de um corpus de 109 redações do Vestibular UNICAMP. Destaca-se seu papel na constituição de unidades rítmicas da escrita e no jogo entre essas unidades no {{interior}} do produto textual, papel que faz mostrar uma organização do heterogêneo da linguagem, por meio da sistematização de fragmentos descontínuos de linguagem na continuidade própria a um fluxo verbalAbstract:The {{purpose of}} this document {{is to establish a}} first characterization of a phenomenon denominated until now in a non systematic way as "rhythm of writing". The pivot point of this characterization or, in other words, the question to be answered after the confirmation of the phenomenon existence is how the rhythm of writing operates in a textual production. In the search for an answer, one discusses in a first instance the role of rhythm in the language. In the discussion the rhythm is dislocated from its restricted oral or verse functions and is related to the multi-dimensional organization of language the linguistic meaning the enunciation and to time in language. Having as background this main role of the rhythm in language. we proceed in a second moment with some particularities of rhythm which are perceived by the authors in the writing first. As a result one verifies that (a} the phenomenon is always perceived in a context where the links of writing and orality are discusséd; (b) rhythm entail orality and writing, however each of these codes denotes a peculiar rhythm since they are semiotically distinct; (c) the rhythm builds through the inter-relation of the varia dimensions of language the symbolic character of writing; (d) the rhythm of writing is detected through marks which spatialize the elements of the language's <b>graphic</b> <b>activity</b> creating among the spatialized elements a characteristic movement. The marks chosen for the analysis of the rhythm of writing in this work were the punctuation marks. Thus in a third moment we check the compatibility between the grammar scholars' and linguists's approaches on the usage of punctuation and our main conclusions from the discussions on the role of rhythm in language and its function in writing. At last we demonstrate in a fourth instance the role of the rhythm of writing through the anatyses of a corpus of 109 essays taken from the qualification exams of the Campinas University - UNICAMP. Its role is pointed out in the constitution of written rhythmic units and by the altemation of these units within the textual product. It shows a heterogeneous organization of language by systematizing the language's discontinuous fragments into a continuous verbal flo...|$|E
