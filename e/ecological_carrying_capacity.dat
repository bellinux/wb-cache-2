While the ecological environment in the Cing-Jing region from 2008 to 2014 was found to be within safe levels, all related indices had increased considerably. A Grey model was used to predict the 2015 – 2024 <b>ecological</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacities,</b> from which it was found that there is expected to be a large increase in per capita ecological footprints (EFs), meaning that in the future there is going to be a larger ecological deficit and a higher ecological pressure index (EFI), with the eco-security predicted to reach a Grade 2 intermediate level in 2022. As the Cing-Jing region is predicted to become ecologically unsustainable, local, regional, and national governments need to implement regulations to strictly control the land use in the Cing-Jing region.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{needs of}} the {{aquaculture}} industry is the implementation of effective management methods to ensure the sustainability, economic viability and minimization of negative impacts on both human and ecosystem well-being. The authors developed a Fortran 90 implementation of the dynamic energy budget (DEB) model for Mytilus edulis. The model has been further developed to include physiological interactions with the ecosystem and coupled to a biogeochemical nutrient–phytoplankton–zooplankton–detritus (NPZD) model. Phytoplankton and detritus uptakes, oxygen utilisation, CO 2 production, NH 4 excretion, egestion of faeces, and assimilation of food are modelled. A novel approach was derived that accounts for the allocation of C and N in mussel flesh and shell organic fraction. The DEB–NPZD model has been subsequently coupled to a high resolution three dimensional numerical coastal ocean model of the south–west coast of Ireland, where approximately 80 % of national rope mussel is produced annually.

40|$|Due to {{freshwater}} supplement scarcity {{and heavy}} human activities, the fresh water wetland ecosystem in Yellow River Delta is facing disintegrated deterioration, {{and it is}} seriously affecting {{the health of the}} Yellow River ecosystem. This paper identifies the restoration objectives of wetland aiming to protect ecological and economic values and development as well as the water resources of the Yellow River. The hydraulic and groundwater coupling model and Landscape Ecological Decision and Evaluation Support System (LEDESS) of the Yellow River Delta were established to calculate environmental flows of degraded wetlands. LEDESS is a computer-based model developed and used to assess and evaluate the effects of land-use changes on nature. In this study, LEDESS is used to assess and evaluate the ecological effects and the restoration possibilities considering several environmental flows' supplement scenarios. This included the changes of suitable habitat conditions and its <b>ecological</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacities</b> for indicator species, e. g., Red-crowned crane (Grus japonensis), Oriental stork (Ciconia boyciana), and Saunder's gull (Larus relictus), and changing of ecological patterns.

40|$|African cichlid fishes are {{a celebrated}} example of {{evolutionary}} diversification, and {{a thorough understanding}} of this diversification requires studies of both the origins of their diversity, and of the factors influencing broad scale evolutionary patterns. This body of work addresses evolutionary questions at these both of these levels. I first test the influence of habitat and distance on fine-scale population genetic structure in three sympatric cichlid species in Lake Tanganyika. These species show striking differences in their patterns of genetic subdivision within the same geographical region, implying substantially different patterns of gene flow. This suggests that both ecological and behavioral traits have a strong influence on the scale and degree of population subdivision, a finding which has implications for understanding differential propensities for diversification among lineages. Next, I study the population genetics of recent speciation in sympatric color morphs from Lake Tanganyika. I report genetic evidence that these color morphs diverged only recently, yet that barriers to gene flow exist which prevent extensive admixture despite their sympatric distribution. This is an unusual example of active diversification in Lake Tanganyika's ancient cichlid fauna. Moving to a macroevolutionary perspective, I next examine the factors that influence cichlid adaptive radiation. Cichlids have radiated within more than thirty African lakes, and in another seventy instances, colonizing lineages are present in lakes without diversifying. Using this "natural experiment", and a dataset iii including both environmental variables and information about the traits of colonizing cichlid lineages, I find that lineage-specific traits related to sexual selection, and environmental factors related to ecological opportunity, both strongly influence whether cichlids radiate. Finally, I examine the environmental influences on the species richness of cichlids within African lakes. I show that total species richness per lake is correlated with measures of lake size and energy, and that the species richness of radiations is limited by these same environmental variables. I conclude that <b>ecological</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>capacities</b> exist which render the total diversity of cichlids predictable within these lakes, but that these diversities are achieved by lineage-specific diversification outcomes, thereby producing marked differences in the faunal composition of different lakes. i...|$|R
