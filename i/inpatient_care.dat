5|$|Continuous Care is {{a service}} {{provided}} in the patient's home. It is for patients who are experiencing severe symptoms and need temporary extra support. Once a patient is on continuous care, the hospice provides services in the home a minimum of eight hours a day. Because the criteria for continuous care is similar to general <b>inpatient</b> <b>care,</b> and due to the challenges a hospice can face with staffing extended day care in the home, continuous care {{is intended to be}} used for short periods of time.|$|E
5|$|In total, {{ten people}} were {{admitted}} to hospital with radiation sickness: the four scrap collectors, the two scrapyard employees, the scrapyard owner, her husband, her mother, and her maid. Of these, four people (those {{working at the}} scrapyard) were estimated to have received radiation doses of over 6 gray (Gy). All patients were ultimately referred to Rajavithi Hospital, where they received <b>inpatient</b> <b>care.</b> All {{but one of the}} patients developed agranulocytosis or bicytopenia (depletion of white blood cells and/or platelets). Several also developed burns, and one (the first scrap collector) had to have his finger amputated. Three patients (the two scrapyard workers and the owner's husband) ultimately died of uncontrolled infection and sepsis, all within two months of exposure.|$|E

25|$|A {{study of}} more than 200,000 women came to the result that {{admission}} to <b>inpatient</b> <b>care</b> during pregnancy was associated with an 18-fold increase in the risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) during the stay, and a 6-fold increase in risk in the four weeks after discharge, compared with pregnant women who did not require hospitalization. The study included women admitted to hospital for one or more days for reasons other than delivery or venous thromboembolism.|$|E
25|$|Anticoagulant {{therapy is}} the {{mainstay}} of treatment. Acutely, supportive treatments, such as oxygen or analgesia, may be required.

Increasingly, however, low-risk cases are managed at home in a fashion already common in the treatment of DVT. Evidence to support one approach versus the other is weak.|$|E

25|$|An {{unpublished}} 2012 {{study from}} Colorado State University showed good results with an intensive at-home treatment using maropitant (Cerenia) and Convenia (a long acting antibiotic injection), two drugs released by Zoetis (formerly Pfizer). This treatment {{was based on}} outpatient care, and would cost $200 to $300, {{a fraction of the}} $1,500 to $3,000 that <b>inpatient</b> <b>care</b> cost. However, the more-effective care is intravenous (IV) fluid therapy. In the CSU study, survival rate for the new treatment group was 85%, compared to the 90% survival for the conventional inpatient treatment. Note that the outpatient dogs received initial intravenous fluid resuscitation, and had aggressive subcutaneous fluid therapy and daily monitoring by a veterinarian.|$|E
25|$|The Huntington Veteran's Administration (VA) Medical Center, on Spring Valley Drive, is an 80-bed {{medical and}} {{surgical}} care facility that offers primary inpatient and outpatient care, along {{with mental health}} services and subspeciality outpatient options.

30|$|The major {{finding was}} that URMs, from an {{epidemiological}} perspective, were markedly overrepresented in both voluntary and involuntary <b>inpatient</b> psychiatric <b>care.</b> URMs in different host countries and with different origins {{have high levels of}} mental health problems, including PTSD, depression, anxiety and emotional and behavioural problems (Huemer et al. 2009; Bronstein et al. 2012; Bronstein et al. 2013; Jakobsen et al. 2014). The psychiatric morbidity, along with the higher rate of self-harm or suicidal behaviour, contributed to the overrepresentation of URMs in voluntary and involuntary <b>inpatient</b> psychiatric <b>care</b> (Gordon 2002).|$|R
25|$|However, {{in early}} 2011, representatives from school {{employee}} health care trust funds, nursing associations, community health clinics, and others accused Benefis of raising prices 16 percent in 2010 and 30 percent overall since {{removal of the}} COPA agreement. But Benefis also said its costs fell 2 percent in the 2008-2009 period, and another 8 percent in 2010. Benefis denied the accusation, saying the 16 percent figure was overstated because much of that number came from a discontinuation of health care price breaks the health system used to provide. Benefis officials also said their charges for <b>inpatient</b> <b>care</b> were still 2.6 percent below those of its peers, while charges for outpatient service were 29.2 percent lower. Benefis also said it would implement no price increase in 2011, and hoped to reduce costs another 5.2 percent.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the center joined with Harvard Medical School to provide {{surgical}} training and also provided residencies for graduates of Dartmouth Medical School. The aging veteran population in New Hampshire {{led to the}} addition of a residential nursing home and an ambulatory care wing in the late 1970s. Over the years several medical research centers were established, including one for post-traumatic stress disorder. The center originally had a 28-bed full-service hospital. Starting in 1999 the center eliminated its <b>inpatient</b> <b>care</b> services, and the center concentrated on urgent and primary care and on ambulatory and outpatient services. Following the closure, patients requiring a full-service hospital were sent to VA hospitals in Boston, Massachusetts, and White River Junction, Vermont. The center also established in-patient treatment contracts with non-VA hospitals in New Hampshire such as Concord Hospital.|$|E
500|$|General <b>inpatient</b> <b>care</b> is an {{intensive}} {{level of care}} which may be provided in a nursing home, a specially contracted hospice bed or unit in a hospital, or in a free-standing hospice unit. General inpatient criteria is for patients who are experiencing severe symptoms which require daily interventions from the hospice team to manage. Often, patients on this level of care have begun the [...] "active phase" [...] of dying, when their prognosis is measured in days as opposed to weeks or months. Although {{there is a limit}} to how long Medicare will cover this level of care, it is usually provided for brief periods of time, with five to seven days being the average.|$|E
