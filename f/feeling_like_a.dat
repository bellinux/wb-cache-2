5|$|One of {{the reasons}} the {{development}} team chose Tokyo as the main setting was that its turbulent history, going through multiple phases of development and often suffering severe damage in wars or due to natural disasters, made it comparable with the fantasy settings of other games at the time. In a later interview, an Atlus staff member stated that this setting and style made it the antithesis of traditional fantasy RPGs, adding that this resulted in the game developing a punk spirit. Because of the post-apocalyptic setting of Megami Tensei II, the development team wanted to depict a time before the apocalypse. The decision to set the game in Tokyo was made by Suzuki and Kaneko, and was influenced by manga such as Violence Jack, Devilman, and Fist of the North Star. Kichijōji was decided to be the game's starting point due to Kaneko, Suzuki, and Ito all having lived in or near the area, or having visited it often. The abandoned Terminal Echo building there fascinated them, making them wonder how a building in such a prime location could remain unoccupied; Ito described it as two floors of arcade cabinets, {{with the rest of the}} building <b>feeling</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> ghost town. This fascination led to it being included as a dungeon in the game. While designing the maps, Kaneko wanted to use wire-frame models, but the Super Famicom's limited capacities meant this idea was scrapped.|$|E
5|$|The Spring 2013 Anime Preview Guide {{written by}} Rebecca Silverman, {{also of the}} Anime News Network, {{expressed}} differing sentiments than that of Dong. Silverman was quick to mention {{that she had not}} previously played the game to which the series was based on. With that being said, she described the first episode as not <b>feeling</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> game adaptation since you at no point have the sensation of watching someone else play. She also noted that the transformation from the everyday world to one of total chaos and destruction as both swift and impressive. She supported this by citing similar descriptions of the destruction caused by the Great Kantō earthquake of the 1920s. In her full series review, Silverman went into detail about how noticeably dark the series as a whole is when taking into account its animated depictions coupled with the death themes used. Unlike fellow reviewer Bamboo Dong, Silverman felt that character deaths would hit viewers more personally since they get to know them as the story progress and are then suddenly torn down. She further wrote that nearly every character death can potentially pack a punch since they are removed from the ending animation upon their demise. On the other hand, Silverman remarked that some of the characters were truly unlikable as they did not appear to grow and change.|$|E

25|$|Forgiveness in Hinduism {{does not}} {{necessarily}} require that one reconcile with the offender, nor does it rule out reconciliation in some situations. Instead forgiveness in Hindu philosophy is being compassionate, tender, kind and {{letting go of the}} harm or hurt caused by someone or something else. Forgiveness is essential for one to free oneself from negative thoughts, and being able to focus on blissfully living a moral and ethical life (dharmic life). In the highest self-realized state, forgiveness becomes essence of one's personality, where the persecuted person remains unaffected, without agitation, without <b>feeling</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> victim, free from anger (akrodhi).|$|E
25|$|Arc Symphony was {{developed}} by Sophia Park and Penelope Evans using the game engine Twine. Both of them had prior experience with fan communities: Evans mentioned having {{been a member of}} message boards for the game The Sims 2 as a child and having nostalgic feelings for it, while Park said that although she did not miss old websites, bulletin board systems and mailing lists, they still were a part of her. Evans described the game's interactions as <b>feeling</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> real forum experience, saying that while people look at pixels at their screen, a real person is on the other side, and that both parties get to accept or reject the other, with the possibility of hurting them.|$|E

Studying with Pearson {{for the next two}} years and reading Pearson's work on the philosophy of science, titled The Grammar of Science, further shaped Georgescu's scientific methodology and philosophy. The two men even made a friendship, and Pearson encouraged Georgescu to carry on with his studies in mathematical statistics. They co-pioneered research on the so-called 'problem of moments', one of the most difficult topics in statistics at the time, but neither of them were able to solve the problem. This was a great disappointment to Pearson, but Georgescu was pleased about experiencing their joint effort nonetheless.|$|E

The singer expresses in a style similar to Baroque opera the dramatic development from <b>feeling</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "monster in God's eyes" [...] to being forgiven.

Bob Colayco of GameSpot also reviewed the PC version of the game, as he did its Xbox 360 counterpart. Colayco again commended the sound, calling the presentation of the game [...] "excellent", as well as praising the aggression of the artificial intelligence. Unlike in his review of the Xbox 360 version, Colayco felt the multiplayer aspect was [...] "fun". His main critique was for performance, stating [...] "performance can chug at times".

Entertainment Weekly film critic Owen Gleiberman described the film as <b>feeling</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> [...] "period piece" [...] and rated it a C+. Reuterss Stephen Farber called the film a disappointment, because although it was [...] "expertly acted, impeccably photographed, intelligently written" [...] and [...] "even intermittently touching", Never Let Me Go is [...] "too parched and ponderous to connect with a large audience". He said the film should have laid out more completely the logic of its parallel universe, such as the cloning process. He found its theme of the dangers of medical experimentation [...] "rather tired".|$|E

[...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called the song the lone [...] "dud" [...] from The Fame Monster, [...] "not because it's a bad song or poorly performed, but because, like on The Fame, when [...] does try to show her softer side, it comes off as a fraud—at least alongside the rest of her material."

500|$|Initial {{reviews for}} Night Trap on the Sega CD were mixed. The title is notable {{for being the}} first {{interactive}} movie on the system and was thus seen as breaking new ground {{in terms of both}} genre and technology. Critics were quick to point out the game's [...] qualities that were reminiscent of teen horror movies. The staff at Sega Force felt that playing the game was like [...] "directing your own B movie. Night Trap makes you feel part of the game." [...] Along with <b>feeling</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> B movie, critics identified the [...] "warped" [...] and [...] "tacky" [...] sense of humor as helping the game's appeal and adding to its charm. From a technological perspective, the video quality was praised for being high-quality and smooth, although the Sega CD's low color capabilities were identified as a weakness. The most common point of complaint was the gameplay. Some critics cited it for being boring and shallow because it mostly involved pressing one button at the right time to trap the enemies. The staff at Computer and Video Games felt Night Trap was reminiscent of Dragon's Lair (1983) and Space Ace (1984) and shared the same issues those games had with gameplay just being a matter of hitting buttons in the right moments.|$|E
