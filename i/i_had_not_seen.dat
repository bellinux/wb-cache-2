When everything is absolutely ticking, so to speak, a strong fellow like Snow finds not only an extra yard of pace but seems able to keep an unerring eye on the target. The merit of Snow is that in this form is not only that that high arm and loose wrist get the utmost life and lift from the pitch but that he is so extraordinarily straight.|$|E
500|$|Despite its {{derivative}} nature, Longacre's eagle {{has been}} widely admired. According to art historian Cornelius Vermeule in his book on U.S. coins, the flying eagle motif, when used in the 1830s, was [...] "the first numismatic bird that {{could be said to}} derive from nature rather than from colonial carving or heraldry". Vermeule described the Flying Eagle cent's replacement, the Indian Head cent, as [...] "far less attractive to the eye than the Peale-Gobrecht flying eagle and its variants". Sculptor Augustus Saint-Gaudens, when commissioned in 1905 to provide new designs for American coinage, sought to return a flying eagle design to the cent, writing to President Theodore Roosevelt, [...] "I am using a flying eagle, a modification of the device which was used on the cent of 1857. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> that coin for many years, and was so impressed by it that I thought if carried out with some modifications, nothing better could be done. It is by all odds the best design on any American coin." [...] Saint-Gaudens did return the flying eagle to American coinage, but his design was used for the reverse of the double eagle rather than the cent.|$|E

500|$|De Laurentiis visited Ridley Scott {{on the set}} of Gladiator and {{suggested}} to Ridley he read the novel he had bought the rights to. Scott was in the third week before principal photography was due to finish on Gladiator. Gladiator became a commercial and critical success, earning 12 Academy Award nominations. De Laurentiis asked Scott if he would like to direct the film version of Hannibal. Scott misunderstood which Hannibal he meant, thinking De Laurentiis was speaking of the general and historical figure from Carthage who nearly brought down the Roman Empire back around 200 B.C., so he replied: [...] "Basically, Dino, I'm doing a Roman epic right now. I don't wanna do elephants coming over the Alps next, old boy." [...] Scott read the manuscript in four sittings within a week, believing it to be a [...] "symphony", and expressed his desire to do it. Scott further explains how he got involved: [...] "I was shooting Gladiator in Malta and one day, for the hell of it, I went for a walk for half a mile down the road to the Malta Film Studio to see my old buddy Dino. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> him since I'd worked on a version of Dune. This was pre-Blade Runner. Dino had pursued me to direct Dune and another film. He's always enthusiastic and aggressive and came after me when I did both Blade Runner and Alien, but I couldn't do the films. Anyway, we had an espresso together and a few days later, he called me to ask if he could visit the Gladiator set. He arrived with a manuscript of Hannibal, about a month before it was published in book form. He said: 'Let's make this one.' I haven't read anything so fast since The Godfather. It was so rich in all kind of ways." ...|$|E
2500|$|Smith {{enlisted in}} the United States Marine Corps as a combat {{correspondent}} and would {{take part in the}} Battle of Iwo Jima in 1945. [...] In the amphibious landing on February 19, 1945, Smith went ashore in the third wave of soldiers with his rifle but without his typewriter, which had been lost at sea. [...] Smith's Los Angeles Times column would occasionally recount his experiences during the battle. [...] On the subject of the iconic Iwo Jima flag raising, Smith addressed a sometimes discussed controversy of a second, larger American flag being raised to replace the initially planted one (as the first one was too small to be seen by the soldiers fighting on the island). [...] He recalled that he [...] "happened to look up at Mt. Suribachi from the beach that day and saw [...] rippling in the breeze. [...] I did not feel cheated because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> the first one." ...|$|E
2500|$|Palash Sen, {{the lead}} singer of the Indian rock band Euphoria sued and sent a legal notice to Ram Sampath, for {{plagiarism}} of the title track of the show. Sen commented that, [...] "The trailers and the anthem of this show have been running on television for quite a while, but <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> the videos. When I heard it, I was shocked." [...] He claimed that in the year 2000, his band Euphoria released its second album Phir Dhoom, {{and one of its}} songs was named [...] "Satyameva Jayate". According to him, the refrain of Ram Sampath's track is exactly the same as the chants in his song. He went on to add that, [...] "They've basically used the same refrain. Jo baaki ka gaana hai (the rest of the song), has different words and tune. But the mainstay of the song— the chorus– is ours." [...] Sen also stated that he wouldn't have minded giving Sampath the permission to use the tune of his version of [...] "Satyamev Jayate" [...] had he asked him for his consent and in return he would have just asked for a small credit to the band for the song.|$|E

2500|$|Rivers {{had visited}} his college {{frequently}} {{during the war}} although, having resigned his position as lecturer, he held no official post. However, upon his return from the Royal Air Force in 1919, the college created a new office for him – [...] "Praelector of Natural Science Studies" [...] – and {{he was given a}} free rein to do as he pleased. As Leonard E. Shore recalled in 1923: [...] "when I asked him if he would undertake that work... his eyes shone with a new light <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>seen</b> before, and he paced his rooms for several minutes full of delight." [...] He took his new position to be a mandate to get to know every science student and indeed every other student at St. Johns, Cambridge, and at other colleges. He would arrange [...] "At Homes" [...] in his rooms on Sunday evenings, as well as Sunday morning breakfast meetings; he also organised informal discussions and formal lectures (many of which he gave himself) in the College Hall. He formed a group called The Socratics and brought to it some of his most influential friends, including H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett, Bertrand Russell and Sassoon. Sassoon (Patient B in Conflict and Dream), remained particularly friendly with Rivers and regarded him as a mentor. [...] They shared Socialist sympathies.|$|E
