40|$|Rich {{evidence}} has highlighted that stimulation of gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) (B) receptors increases {{the occurrence of}} spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs), the electroencephalographic (EEG) landmark of absence epilepsy (AE). Recent {{findings suggest that the}} outcomes of GABA(B) activation in vivo are contingent on the chemical characteristics of the agonist. In particular, the endogenous ligand hydroxybutyrate (GHB) and its precursor <b>gamma-butyro-lactone</b> (GBL) have been shown to elicit different effects than the prototypical GABA(B) agonist baclofen. In view of these premises, the present study was aimed at the characterization of the effects of baclofen (0. 5 - 10 mg/kg, i. p.) and GBL (5 - 100 mg/kg, i. p.) on the spontaneous SWDs and locomotor activity of DBA/ 2 J mice. While both baclofen and GBL dose-dependently increased SWDs episodes, high doses of the latter (100 mg/kg, i. p.) reduced the occurrence of these phenomena and increased the number of isolated spikes. Interestingly, both compounds elicited a dose-dependent reduction of locomotor activity, in comparison with their vehicle-treated controls. The GABA(B) selective antagonist, SCHS 0911 (50 mg/kg, i. p.), reversed the changes in SWD occurrence and locomotion induced by baclofen and GBL, but failed to elicit intrinsic effects on either paradigm. These results indicate that GABA(B) receptor signaling might exert differential effects on SWDs in DBA/ 2 J mice. (C) 2010 British Epilepsy Association. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The Baeyer-Villiger {{oxidation}} of ketones to {{the corresponding}} esters or lactones {{is a valuable}} transformation that has been upgraded several times over the last century, from the original use of monopersulfuric acid as oxidant to more atom efficient and environmentally friendly oxidants such as hydrogen peroxide. The latter requires activation with organometallic complexes to explicate its oxidizing power. The catalytic version of the reaction can be achieved with several transition metal catalysts, but major differences are present among the various catalysts proposed in terms of scope of the reaction. In particular, most of the catalytic systems are active towards four-membered ring ketones leading to the corresponding substituted <b>gamma-butyro-lactones.</b> Pt(II) complexes characterized by the employment of chelating diphosphines {{turned out to be}} the most efficient in catalyzing the BV oxidation of a wider range of substrates, in particular cyclohexanones are Suitable substrates and acyclic ketones can be converted into the corresponding esters, albeit with low turnover. As long as organometallic catalyzed BV reaction is concerned, Pt(II) catalysts show the most versatile activity and selectivity. Such peculiar features are the result of the unique electronic properties of such metal combined with an easily tailored soft Lewis acid character modulated by the proper choice of the ancillary ligands. The enantioselective version of the reaction benefits from these properties and the compatibility of Pt(II) species with water enabled the development of asymmetric catalytic BV reactions in water aided by the presence of micelles as dynamic self-assembled environments.

40|$|Photocatalysis with {{visible light}} is {{undoubtedly}} {{one of the}} emerging strategies to meet the increasing demand for more sustainable processes. This thesis describes the use of visible light as a promoter for organic transformations. Most of the organic molecules are unable to absorb light in the visible region. Keeping this in mind, we utilized Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 complex as photosensitizer. We developed ‘‘Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2, 1, 5 -dimethoxynaphthalene-ascorbic acid’’, a new photocatalytic combination for reduction of carbon-halogen bonds. This conceptually new photocatalytic system with visible light is very efficient to drive sequential electron transfer processes for reductive debromination of vicinal dibromo carbonyl compounds to (E) -alkenes and alkynes, gem-dibromides to monobromides, and monobromides or chlorides to their dehalogenated counterparts. As a key structural feature, a carbonyl group positioned alpha-to one halogen atom {{is required for the}} success of the transformation. The photosystem is also highlighted by its chemoselectivity, resulting in reduced products in high yields under mild reaction conditions. Singlet oxygen (1 O 2) is a higher energy state molecular oxygen. It is quite well known as a reaction intermediate for cycloaddition reactions to produce endoperoxides and ene reactions to provide allylic hydroperoxides. This highly reactive singlet oxygen has shown to be efficiently photosensitized by a large number of compounds, most of which have been organic compounds. We utilized Ru(bpy) 3 Cl 2 complex as a singlet oxygen generator in presence of visible light and performed oxidative cleavage of cyclic enamines and enol ethers. Beta- and gamma-aminoacids and their derivatives are very important constituents of natural products and valuable intermediates for the preparation of peptidomimetics. Applying our methodology we successfully performed oxidative ring opening of cyclic enamines, which lead to Beta- and higher amino acid analogs. The oxidative cleavage of enamines by this method leads to products, which preserve the relative and absolute stereochemistry of starting material. This methodology can also be utilized as an alternative of hazardous ozone to perform this type of oxidative cleavage. This thesis also describes the studies towards the synthesis of natural product Sandresolide A, a nor-diterpene lactone. Every natural product type isolated from the seemingly limitless chemical diversity in nature provides a unique set of research opportunities deriving from its distinctive three-dimensional architecture and biological properties. Diterpene and sesquiterpene lactones exhibit a broad range of biological activity along with the structural diversity and stimulate the development of research in their total synthesis. The essence of total synthesis lies in how readily available starting materials can be converted to complex molecular architectures through controlled, efficient and logically orchestrated carbon-carbon and carbon-heteroatom bond connectivities. With our synthetic approach we showed how simple aromatic starting materials could be converted to chiral building blocks such as anti-disubstituted <b>gamma-butyro-lactones</b> that are key structural motifs of guaianolides and can also be utilized as central basic unit to build different types of ring system other than guauanolides. Starting from furoic ester, we tried to synthesize the natural product Sandresolide A where trans- 4, 5 -disubstituted gamma-butyro lactone served as a central building block of the molecule. ...|$|R
