25|$|On December 22, 2006 in an {{agreement}} amongst the Coast Guard, National Guard and the Commonwealth of Massachusetts a partnership {{was created in}} which the Coast Guard would assume control of the aviation facilities from the Air Force (Runways, taxiways, etc.) while the Air National Guard will manage the utilities (Electricity, water, sewerage, etc.) and the state will fund the emergency services and fire protection. The Federal Aviation Administration has released new <b>flight</b> <b>procedures</b> that identify the ICAO code KFMH {{with the name of}} Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod. This does not signify a name change as it has not been officially announced. The FAA sometimes does issue plans that call an airport a different name than is commonly known. With the control of the airfield changing hands, improvements to the lighting system were put in control of the Coast Guard. The base is still known as Otis among locals, but the media reports it as Coast Guard Air Station Cape Cod.|$|E
25|$|The astronauts {{went through}} a {{training}} program covering {{some of the same}} exercises that were used in their selection. They simulated the g-force profiles of launch and reentry in a centrifuge at the Naval Air Development Center, and were taught special breathing techniques necessary when subjected to more than 6 g. Weightlessness training took place in aircraft, first on the rear seat of a two-seater fighter and later inside converted and padded cargo aircraft. They practiced gaining control of a spinning spacecraft in a machine at the Lewis Flight Propulsion Laboratory called the Multi-Axis Spin-Test Inertia Facility (MASTIF), by using an attitude controller handle simulating the one in the spacecraft. A further measure for finding the right attitude in orbit was star and Earth recognition training in planetaria and simulators. Communication and <b>flight</b> <b>procedures</b> were practiced in flight simulators, first together with a single person assisting them and later with the Mission Control Center. Recovery was practiced in pools at Langley, and later at sea with frogmen and helicopter crews.|$|E
25|$|In February 2006, the Israel Airports Authority {{announced}} plans to invest 4.3 million NIS in a new VIP wing for private jet passengers and crews, {{as well as others}} interested in avoiding the main terminal. VIP ground services already exist, but a substantial increase in users has justified expanding the facilities, which will also boost airport revenues. The IAA released figures showing significant growth in private jet flights (4,059, a 36.5% increase from 2004) as well as private jet users (14,613, a 46.2% increase from 2004). The new VIP wing, operated by an outside licensee, will be located in an upgraded and expanded section of Terminal 1. All <b>flight</b> <b>procedures</b> (security check, passport control and customs) will be handled here. This wing will include a hall equipped for press conferences, a deluxe lounge, special meeting rooms equipped with state-of-the-art business facilities and a designated lounge for flight crews who spend time at the airport between flights. It was announced in January 2008, however, that the IAA planned to construct a new 1000square metre VIP terminal next to Terminal 3.|$|E

25|$|The {{findings}} of the investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) were released on March 2, 1993. Ultimately the investigation determined that the crew lost situational awareness, and though unsure of the air traffic control services being provided or their position, began an approach to Runway 5 from an excessive altitude and airspeed without completing the published approach procedures. Though critical of the performance of the flight crew, the report ultimately concluded that the probable cause was the failure of senior management of GP Express to provide adequate training and operational support for the startup of the southern operation, which resulted in the assignment of an inadequately prepared captain with a relatively inexperienced first officer in revenue passenger service and the failure of the flight crew to use approved instrument <b>flight</b> <b>procedures,</b> which resulted in a loss of situational awareness and terrain clearance. Contributing to the cause of the accident was GP Express’ failure to provide approach charts to each pilot and to establish stabilized approach criteria. Also contributing were the inadequate crew coordination and a role reversal {{on the part of the}} captain and first officer.|$|E

However, he resumed his duties after passing a retest on August 27, 1980.

40|$|Increasing {{concerns}} regarding aircraft noise has encouraged {{the push to}} reduce noise via operational adjustments. The objective here is thus to expand analysis capabilities to enable modeling of the impact on aircraft noise due to advanced operational approach procedures, such as delayed deceleration approaches and thrust cutback scheduling on takeoff, for both current and future aircraft designs. Current industry standard noise models rely on flight test data interpolation and do not fully capture noise impacts from airframe configuration or advanced operational techniques. This is critical for noise assessment because airframe noise becomes a significant factor relative to the low thrust levels characteristic of advanced operational approaches. This method also limits the ability to assess new aircraft designs. Therefore, a new method combining aircraft sizing and performance tools with NASA’s Aircraft NOise Prediction Program (ANOPP) has been developed to capture those noise impacts. ANOPP is used because of its capability of computing noise received at ground observers due to both engines and airframe of aircraft flying any <b>flight</b> <b>procedure.</b> Inputs into ANOPP are the aircraft geometry, the <b>flight</b> <b>procedure,</b> and the engine performance during the <b>flight</b> <b>procedure.</b> The Transport Aircraft System OPTimization (TASOPT) model is used to compute the engine performance inputs into ANOPP via first principles, physics-based methods. A separate tool was developed to compute {{the specifics of the}} <b>flight</b> <b>procedure</b> (max glide slope obtainable for a particular velocity and configuration, required thrust levels, etc.) based on drag polar supplied either by the Base of Aircraft Data (BADA 4) for current aircraft or by TASOPT for new aircraft. Benefits of this modeling framework include the flexibility in the aircraft and procedure analyzed and the ability to predict the noise of future aircraft configurations without relying on existing data. Both the noise impacts of a sample advanced operational <b>flight</b> <b>procedure</b> and in a future aircraft fleet have been assessed with this model. Next steps include further use of this model to evaluate the noise benefits or detriments of advanced operational approaches.
