40|$|Summary: The ploidy {{level of}} several tissues and the {{morphological}} characteristics in {{the fruit of}} a haploid plant derived from seedlings of 'Banpeiyu ' pummelo (Citrus maxima (Bunn.) Merr.) were investigated. Flow cytometric analysis revealed that the relative nuclear DNA content of the haploid was half those of the <b>juice</b> <b>sac,</b> pulp segment, albedo, and flabedo of the 'Banpeiyu ' pummelo, and the haploidy was maintained in all tissues of the fruit. With re-gard to morphological characteristics of a fruit, the haploid produced a small fruit, {{a small number of}} locules, and a fine <b>juice</b> <b>sac</b> compared with the 'Banpeiyu ' pummelo. The number of seeds per fi'uit of the 'Banpeiyu ' pummelo was approximately 100, whereas the haploid fruit had no seeds. In all probability, the fruit of the haploid obtained {{in the present study was}} produced by parthenocarpy. Key words: 'Banpeiyu ' pummelo, Flow cytometry, Parthenocarpy, Seedles...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Citrus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} and widely grown commodity fruit crops. In this study a label-free LC-MS/MS based shot-gun proteomics approach was taken to explore three main stages of citrus fruit development. These approaches were used to identify and evaluate changes occurring in <b>juice</b> <b>sac</b> cells in various metabolic pathways affecting citrus fruit development and quality. Results Protein changes in citrus <b>juice</b> <b>sac</b> cells were identified and quantified using label-free shotgun methodologies. Two alternative methods, differential mass-spectrometry (dMS) and spectral counting (SC) were used to analyze protein changes occurring during earlier and late stages of fruit development. Both methods were compared in order to develop a proteomics workflow that could be used in a non-model plant lacking a sequenced genome. In order to resolve the bioinformatics limitations of EST databases from species that lack a full sequenced genome, we established iCitrus. iCitrus is a comprehensive sequence database created by merging three major sources of sequences (HarvEST:citrus, NCBI/citrus/unigenes, NCBI/citrus/proteins) and improving the annotation of existing unigenes. iCitrus provided a useful bioinformatics tool for the high-throughput identification of citrus proteins. We have identified approximately 1500 citrus proteins expressed in fruit <b>juice</b> <b>sac</b> cells and quantified the changes of their expression during fruit development. Our results showed that both dMS and SC provided significant information on protein changes, with dMS providing a higher accuracy. Conclusion Our data supports the notion of the complementary use of dMS and SC for label-free comparative proteomics, broadening the identification spectrum and strengthening the identification of trends in protein expression changes during the particular processes being compared. </p...|$|E
40|$|Label-free LC-MS/MS-based shot-gun {{proteomics}} {{was used}} to quantify the differential protein synthesis and metabolite profiling {{in order to assess}} metabolic changes during the development of citrus fruits. Our results suggested the occurrence of a metabolic change during citrus fruit maturation, where the organic acid and amino acid accumulation seen during the early stages of development shifted into sugar synthesis during the later stage of citrus fruit development. The expression of invertases remained unchanged, while an invertase inhibitor was up-regulated towards maturation. The increased expression of sucrose-phosphate synthase and sucrose- 6 -phosphate phosphatase and the rapid sugar accumulation suggest that sucrose is also being synthesized in citrus <b>juice</b> <b>sac</b> cells during the later stage of fruit development...|$|E
40|$|AbstractCitron (Citrus medica L.) {{is one of}} {{the three}} basic species of the genus Citrus L. that have contributed to the {{development}} of cultivated citrus. We analyzed the genetic diversity of 47 citrons (32 from Yunnan Province, China; and 15 of Mediterranean origin) to understand their diversity and relationships within the species. Genetic analysis was conducted using data from microsatellite markers, single nucleotide polymorphisms generated from sequences of a nuclear malate dehydrogenase gene and a chloroplast gene, rps 16. Neighbor joining and maximum parsimony analyses were conducted. All three approaches found citron to be monophyletic. Population structure analysis clustered the 47 citrons into three distinct groups. The first group consisted of wild, non-fingered citrons generally having locules, <b>juice</b> <b>sacs</b> and seeds within the fruit. The second cluster consisted mostly of fingered citrons that lacked locules, <b>juice</b> <b>sacs</b> or seeds, and some non-fingered types with smaller locules and vestigial <b>juice</b> <b>sacs,</b> but with seeds. All accessions that clustered in groups I and II originated in China. The third cluster consisted of citrons cultivated in the Mediterranean region. Genetic distance between the clusters from population structure analysis indicated considerable diversity within the species. A citron-specific microsatellite marker was identified and characterized. We observed considerable heterozygosity in certain citrons, contrary to previous reports...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, to {{investigate}} the mechanisms regulating carotenoid accumulation in citrus, a culture system {{was set up in}} vitro with <b>juice</b> <b>sacs</b> of three citrus varieties, Satsuma mandarin (Citrus unshiu Marc.), Valencia orange (Citrus sinensis Osbeck), and Lisbon lemon (Citrus limon Burm. f.). The <b>juice</b> <b>sacs</b> of all the three varieties enlarged gradually with carotenoid accumulation. The changing patterns of carotenoid content and the expression of carotenoid metabolic genes in <b>juice</b> <b>sacs</b> in vitro were similar to those ripening on trees in the three varieties. Using this system, the changes in the carotenoid content and the expression of carotenoid metabolic genes in response to environmental stimuli were investigated. The results showed that carotenoid accumulation was induced by blue light treatment, but was not affected by red light treatment in the three varieties. Different regulation of CitPSY expression, which was up-regulated by blue light while unaffected by red light, led to different changes in carotenoid content in response to these two treatments in Satsuma mandarin and Valencia orange. In all three varieties, increases in carotenoid content were observed with sucrose and mannitol treatments. However, the accumulation of carotenoid in the two treatments was regulated by distinct mechanisms at the transcriptional level. With abscisic acid (ABA) treatment, the expression of the genes investigated in this study was up-regulated in Satsuma mandarin and Lisbon lemon, indicating that ABA induced its own biosynthesis at the transcriptional level. This feedback regulation of ABA led to decreases in carotenoid content. With gibberellin (GA) treatment, carotenoid content was significantly decreased in the three varieties. Changes in the expression of genes related to carotenoid metabolism varied among the three varieties in response to GA treatment. These results provided insights into improving carotenoid content and composition in citrus during fruit maturation...|$|R

Poncirin was isolated from four different tissues (flavedo, albedo, segment membrane, and <b>juice</b> <b>sac)</b> of Ougan fruit (Citrus reticulate cv. Suavissima). The highest content of poncirin {{was found in}} the albedo of Ougan fruit (1. 37 mg/g DW). High speed counter-current chromatography (HSCCC) combined with D 101 resin chromatography was utilized for the separation and purification of poncirin from the albedo of Ougan fruit. After this two-step purification, poncirin purity increased from 0. 14 % to 96. 56 %. The chemical structure of the purified poncirin was identified by both HPLC-PDA and LC-MS. Poncirin showed a significant in vitro inhibitory effect on the growth of the human gastric cancer cells, SGC- 7901, in a dose-dependent manner. Thus, poncirin from Ougan fruit, may be beneficial for gastric cancer prevention. The purification method demonstrated here will be useful for further studies on the pharmacological mechanism of poncirin activity, as well as for guiding the consumption of Ougan fruit...|$|E

Organic acids are among the main determinants of taste and organoleptic quality of fruits and hence the control of fruit acidity loss has a strong economical relevance. In citrus, organic acids accumulate in the <b>juice</b> <b>sac</b> cells of developing fruits and are catabolized thereafter during ripening. Aconitase, that transforms citrate to isocitrate, is the first step of citric acid catabolism and a major component of the citrate utilization machinery.

The techniques employed were light microscopy, thin sectioning, negative staining, freeze etching and scanning electron microscopy. Physical and chemical parameters of the particles in the juices, bases and products were also measured and these included cloud level, estimation of hesperidin content and refractive index of hesperidin. The appearance of the cells found in the flavedo, albedo, segment membrane and <b>juice</b> <b>sac</b> were sufficiently characteristic to enable {{the origin of the}} various cellular fragments found in the processed juice to be ascribed to a particular tissue origin. The structures observed in the oil ring formed in the neck of bottles of certain beverages was found to be mainly lipid materials. The form of the lipid was different on beverages with contrasting processing history. Numerous aggregates of oil droplets and hesperidin crystals were observed in the cloudy portion of the beverages, and a substantial number of these particles were less than 0. 5 ?m diameter. A method was evolved for estimating the crystalline hesperidin content of the sample based on the difference in the ultraviolet absorption of a methanol and aqueous extract of the beverage. It was concluded that the quantity of hesperidin present in orange beverages is an important, although not the sole factor in determining its cloud level. Samples with a high cloud level contained high levels of hesperidin. A limited study of lemon beverages indicated that hesperidin content may not play such an important role in their cloud level...|$|E

40|$|The sucrose {{breakdown}} {{mechanisms in}} <b>juice</b> <b>sacs</b> of acid lime (Citrus aurantifolia [Christm. ] Swing.) were investigated throughout fruit development. All three enzymes of sucrose catabolism (sucrose synthase, acid, and alkaline invertase) are present {{during the initial}} stages. The activities of these enzymes declined rapidly and disappeared by stage 5 (80 % development) but not before vacuolar pH had decreased to approximately 2. 5. At this stage, sucrose breakdown occurs by acid hydrolysis. By attaining a vacuolar pH of 2. 5 prior to enzyme disappearance, the cell maintains a continuous ability to break down sucrose throughout ontogeny. Thus, acid limes possess a unique and coordinated system for sucrose breakdown that involves both enzymatic and nonenzymatic pathways...|$|R

40|$|Postphloem, nonvascular {{assimilate}} transport occurs over {{an unusually}} long area in citrus fruit and thus facilitates investigation {{of this process}} relative to sugar entry into many sink structures. Labeled photosynthates moving into juice tissues of grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macf.) slowed dramatically after entering the postphloem transport path (parenchyma cells, narrow portions of segment epidermis, and hair-like, parenchymatous stalks of juice sacs). Kinetic, metabolic, and compositional data indicated that transfer through the nonvascular area was delayed many hours by temporary storage and/or equilibration with sugars in compartments along the postphloem path. Labeled assimilates were generally recovered as sucrose throughout the path, and extent of hexose formation enroute bore no apparent relationship to the assimilate transfer process. Even after 24 hours, radiolabel was restricted to discrete, highly localized areas directly between vascular bundles and juice sacs. Postphloem transfer occurred against an ascending sucrose concentration gradient in young fruit, whereas a descending gradient (favoring diffusion/cytoplasmic streaming) developed only later in maturation. Involvement of a postphloem bulk flow is complicated in the present instance by the extremely limited water loss from juice sacs either via transpiration or fluid backflow. Nonetheless, tissue expansion can account for a collective water inflow of at least 1. 0 milliliter per day throughout the majority of <b>juice</b> <b>sac</b> development, thus providing a modest, but potentially important means of nonvascular solution flow. Overall, data indicate postphloem transfer (a) can follow highly localized paths through sizable nonvascular areas (up to 3. 0 centimeters total), (b) appears to involve temporary storage and/or equilibration with compartmentalized sugars enroute, (c) can occur either against an overall up-hill sugar gradient (young tissues) or along a descending gradient (near full expansion), and (d) appears to involve at least some contribution by nonvascular mass flow accommodated by tissue expansion...|$|E
40|$|Juice {{tissues of}} citrus lack phloem; therefore, photosynthates enroute to juice sacs exit the {{vascular}} {{system on the}} surface of each segment. Areas of extensive phloem unloading and transport (vascular bundles + segment epidermis) can thus be separated from those of assimilate storage (juice sacs) and adjacent tissues where both processes occur (peel). Sugar composition, dry weight accumulation, and activities of four sucrose-metabolizing enzymes (soluble and cell-wall-bound acid invertase, alkaline invertase, sucrose synthase, and sucrose phosphate synthase) were measured in these transport and sink tissues of grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macf.) to determine more clearly whether a given enzyme appeared to be more directly associated with assimilate transport versus deposition or utilization. Results were compared at three developmental stages. Activity of sucrose (per gram fresh weight and per milligram protein) extracted from zones of extensive phloem unloading and transport was significantly greater than from adjacent sink tissues during the stages (II and III) when juice sacs grow most rapidly. In stage II fruit, activity of sucrose synthase also significantly surpassed that of all other sucrose-metabolizing enzymes in extracts from the transport tissues (vascular bundles + segment epidermis). In contrast, sucrose phosphate synthase and alkaline invertase at this stage of growth were the most active enzymes from adjacent, rapidly growing, phloem-free sink tissues (juice sacs). Activity of these two enzymes in extracts from juice sacs was significantly greater than that form the transport tissues (vascular bundles + segment epidermis). Soluble acid invertase was the most active enzyme in extracts from all tissues of very young fruit (stage I), including nonvascular regions, but nearly disappeared prior to the onset of <b>juice</b> <b>sac</b> sugar accumulation.

Real-time RT-PCR expression analyses of the three aconitase citrus genes were performed in pulp tissues along fruit development in acidic and acidless citrus varieties such as mandarins, oranges and lemons. While CcAco 3 expression was always low, CcAco 1 and CcAco 2 genes were generally induced during the rapid phase of fruit growth along with the maximum in acidity and the beginning of the acid reduction. Two exceptions to this general pattern were found: 1) Clemenules mandarin failed inducing CcAco 2 although acid levels were rapidly reduced; and 2) the acidless "Sucreña" orange showed unusually high levels of expression of both aconitases, an observation correlating with the acidless phenotype. However, in the acidless "Dulce" lemon aconitase expression was normal suggesting that the acidless trait in this variety is not dependent upon aconitases. Conclusions Phylogenetic studies showed the occurrence of five different subfamilies of aconitate hydratase in plants and sequence analyses indentified three active genes in citrus. The pattern of expression of two of these genes, CcAco 1 and CcAco 2, was normally associated with the timing of acid content reduction in most genotypes.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between carotenoid accumulation and {{the expression of}} carotenoid biosynthetic genes during fruit maturation was investigated in three citrus varieties, Satsuma mandarin (Citrus unshiu Marc.), Valencia orange (Citrus sinensis Osbeck), and Lisbon lemon (Citrus limon Burm. f.). We cloned the cDNAs for phytoene synthase (CitPSY), phytoene desaturase (CitPDS), ζ-carotene (car) desaturase (CitZDS), carotenoid isomerase (CitCRTISO), lycopene β-cyclase (CitLCYb), β-ring hydroxylase (CitHYb), zeaxanthin (zea) epoxidase (CitZEP), and lycopene ε-cyclase (CitLCYe) from Satsuma mandarin, which shared high identities in nucleotide sequences with Valencia orange, Lisbon lemon, and other plant species. With the transition of peel color from green to orange, the change from β,ε-carotenoid (α-car and lutein) accumulation to β,β-carotenoid (β-car, β-cryptoxanthin, zea, and violaxanthin) accumulation was observed in the flavedos of Satsuma mandarin and Valencia orange, accompanying the disappearance of CitLCYe transcripts {{and the increase in}} CitLCYb transcripts. Even in green fruit, high levels of β,ε-carotenoids and CitLCYe transcripts were not observed in the <b>juice</b> <b>sacs.</b> As fruit maturation progressed in Satsuma mandarin and Valencia orange, a simultaneous increase in the expression of genes (CitPSY, CitPDS, CitZDS, CitLCYb, CitHYb, and CitZEP) led to massive β,β-xanthophyll (β-cryptoxanthin, zea, and violaxanthin) accumulation in both the flavedo and <b>juice</b> <b>sacs.</b> The gene expression of CitCRTISO was kept low or decreased in the flavedo during massive β,β-xanthophyll accumulation. In the flavedo of Lisbon lemon and Satsuma mandarin, massive accumulation of phytoene was observed with a decrease in the transcript level for CitPDS. Thus, the carotenoid accumulation during citrus fruit maturation was highly regulated by the coordination of the expression among carotenoid biosynthetic genes. In this paper, the mechanism leading to diversity in β,β-xanthophyll compositions between Satsuma mandarin and Valencia orange was also discussed {{on the basis of the}} substrate specificity of β-ring hydroxylase and the balance of expression between upstream synthesis genes (CitPSY, CitPDS, CitZDS, and CitLCYb) and downstream synthesis genes (CitHYb and CitZEP) ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. To further our {{understanding}} of the mechanisms of sugar uptake and accumulation into grapefruit (Citrus paradisiMacf. cv. Marsh seedless), the patterns of uptake and utilisation of sucrose, glucose and fructose by Citrus juice cells was investigated. Analyses were conducted on sliced <b>juice</b> <b>sacs</b> that were incubated in radioactive [14 C]-sugar solutions with unlabelled sugars, in {{the presence or absence of}} metabolic inhibitors. Both hexoses demonstrated an initial uptake peak in December and a second uptake peak in February–March. From March through April the rates of sucrose uptake increased to levels comparable to those of glucose and fructose. Sucrose and its moieties fructose and glucose entered the juice cells of Citrus juice fruit by an insaturable, and mostly by an independent, process. However, NaN 3 and carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone (CCCP) produced slight inhibition of these processes. Cells took up hexoses at a greater rate than sucrose, with accumulation reaching a plateau by 4 – 8 h, and then continuing unabated, in the case of glucose, for 42 h. Uptake of all three sugars increased linearly in the range of sugar concentrations tested, which extended from 0. 01 to 320 mM, denoting an insaturable system for sugar uptake. 14 CO 2 evolution was relatively low in all the experiments, the lowest evolution being recorded when the uptake of [14 C]-sucrose was studied, while the highest 14 CO 2 evolution was recorded when the uptake of [14 C]-glucose was studied.

Citramalate inhibited the mitochondrial, but not cytosolic form of the enzyme. Its external application to mandarin fruits resulted in inhibition of aconitase activity, with a transient increase in fruit acidity detected a few weeks later. The endogenous level of citramalate was analyzed in five citrus varieties: its pattern of accumulation challenged the notion of its action as an endogenous inhibitor of mitochondrial aconitase. Metabolite profiling of oxalomalate-treated cells showed significant increases in a few amino acids and organic acids. The activities of alanine transaminase, aspartate transaminase and aspartate kinase, as well as these of two ¿-aminobutyrate (GABA) -shunt enzymes, succinic semialdehyde reductase (SSAR) and succinic semialdehyde dehydrogenase (SSAD) were significantly induced in oxalomalate-treated cells.

In this study, extensive data-mining with the PH 5 sequence and PCR amplification confirmed that there are at least eight PH 5 -like genes (CsPH 1 - 8) in the citrus genome. CsPHs have a molecular mass of approximately 100 kDa, and they have high similarity to PhPH 5, AtAHA 10 or AtAHA 2 (from 64. 6 % to 80. 9 %). They contain 13 - 21 exons and 12 - 20 introns and were evenly distributed into four subgroups of the P 3 A-subfamily (CsPH 1, CsPH 2, and CsPH 3 in Group I, CsPH 4 and CsPH 5 in Group II, CsPH 6 in Group IV, and CsPH 7 and CsPH 8 in Group III together with PhPH 5). A transcript analysis showed that CsPH 1, 3, and 4 were predominantly expressed in mature leaves, whereas CsPH 2 and 7 were predominantly expressed in roots, CsPH 5 and 6 were predominantly expressed in flowers, and CsPH 8 was predominantly expressed in fruit <b>juice</b> <b>sacs.</b> Moreover, the CsPH transcript profiles differed between orange and pummelo, as well as between high-acid and low-acid cultivars. The low-acid orange ‘Honganliu’ exhibits low transcript levels of CsPH 3, CsPH 4, CsPH 5, and CsPH 8, whereas the acid-free pummelo has only a low transcript level of CsPH 8. In addition, ABA injection increased the citrate content significantly, which was accompanied by the obvious induction of CsPH 2, 6, 7, and 8 transcript levels.

Gene structure and phylogeny analysis showed an evolutionary consistency with other plant species. The six Sus genes contain 12 - 15 exons and 11 - 14 introns and were evenly distributed into the three plant Sus groups (CitSus 1 and CitSus 2 in the Sus I group, CitSus 3 and CitSus 6 in the Sus II group, and CitSus 4 and CitSus 5 in the Sus III group). Transcripts of these six CitSus genes were subsequently examined. For tissues and organs, CitSus 1 and 2 were predominantly expressed in fruit <b>juice</b> <b>sacs</b> (JS) whereas CitSus 3 and 4 were predominantly expressed in early leaves (immature leaves), and CitSus 5 and 6 were predominantly expressed in fruit JS and in mature leaves.

In the fruit segment membrane (SM), the transcript levels of CitSus 2 and 5 were markedly higher and the abundant levels of CitSus 3 and 6 gradually decreased.

40|$|Citrus {{rootstocks}} have well-known {{effects on}} tree size, crop load, fruit size, and various fruit quality factors. Fruit from trees budded on invigorating rootstocks are generally larger with lower soluble solids concentration (SSC) and titratable acidity compared to fruit from trees budded on less invigorating rootstocks. Although {{it is unclear}} how rootstocks exert their influence on juice quality of Citrus L. species, plant water relations are thought to play a central role. In addition, the larger fruit size associated with invigorating rootstocks and the inverse relationship between SSC and fruit size implies that fruit borne on trees on invigorating rootstocks have lower SSC due to dilution effects in larger fruit. To determine how rootstock type affects sugar accumulation in fruit of Citrus species, controlled water-deficit stress was applied to mature 'Valencia' sweet orange [C. sinensis (L.) Osb. ] trees on Carrizo citrange [C. sinensis x Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf. ] or rough lemon (C. jambhiri Lush.) rootstocks. Withholding water from the root zone of citrus trees during stage II of fruit development decreased midday stem water potential and increased the concentrations of primary osmotica, fructose and glucose. Sucrose concentration was not affected, suggesting that sucrose hydrolysis took place. Increased concentrations of sugars and SSC in fruit from moderately water-stressed trees occurred independently of fruit size and juice content. Thus, passive dehydration of <b>juice</b> <b>sacs,</b> and concentration of soluble solids, was not the primary cause of differences in sugar accumulation. Controlled water-deficit stress caused active osmotic adjustment in fruit of 'Valencia' sweet orange. However, when water-deficit stress was applied later in fruit development (e. g., stage III) there was no increase in sugars or SSC. The evidence presented supports the hypothesis that differential sugar accumulation of citrus fruit from trees on rootstocks of contrasting vigor and, hence, plant water relations, is caused by differences in tree water status and the enhancement of sucrose hydrolysis into component hexose sugars resulting in osmotic adjustment. Therefore, inherent rootstock differences affecting plant water relations are proposed as a primary cause of differences in sugar accumulation and SSC among citrus rootstocks. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Citrus fruits are an {{important}} nutritional source for human health and have immense economic value. Fruit development and ripening are key processes {{in the production of}} the phytonutrients, which are essential for a balanced diet and for disease prevention. The anthocyanins are respon-sible for red pigmentation in the flesh of sweet orange {{and one of the most}} important antioxidant compounds together with carotenoids (in particular lycopene) and ascorbic acid. These compounds contribute to protect against certain cancers, cardiovascular diseases, and other degene-rative processes. The anthocyanin pathway is well described, and gene coding enzymes of the biosynthesis sequenced and analyzed at the molecular level. The generally identical structure and composition of genes taking part to anthocyanins pathway and their higher expression in blood oranges compared to common ones, suggested the investigation on regu-latory network, in particular MYB transcription factors that play {{an important}} role in activation of the biosynthesis. In a recent study, the association of a long terminal repeat (LTR) to a Myb-like gene was found correlated to the red pigmentation in the flesh fruits of sweet orange cultivars. Citrus fruits are important also for their content of ascorbic acid. The gene transcription of key enzymes involved in the four known biosynthesis pathways of the vitamin C resulted up-regulated specifically in fruit, contributing to the high vitamin C accumulation in <b>juice</b> <b>sacs.</b> Moreover, new data related to the GalUR gene family in the citrus genome may suggest its involvement. The expected variability within Citrus species is low, due to the origin by spontaneous mutation and vegetative propagation, leading to a narrow genetic basis. Sweet orange, lemon, lime and grapefruit, are characterized by high heterozygosis, but nearly all cultivars are similar, as they originate from a common ancestor hybrid. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) identification performed on various accessions of Citrus clementine and C. sinensis, confirmed the higher heterozygosity of sweet orange respect to clementine; and the presence of very few SNPs linked to agronomical characteristics. The development of next generation sequencing technologies will provide precise description of the genetic composition of citrus accessions and species. In particular, the availability of the citrus genome will permit to increase the opportunity identifying SNP markers to be used to develop citrus assay platforms for breeders. The further step will be to exploit both transcriptome and genome information to map the location of natural genetic variants that confer economically important traits mostly in the fruit...|$|R
