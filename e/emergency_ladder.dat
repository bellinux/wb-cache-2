40|$|An {{interview}} {{study was}} performed in order to reveal {{some of the problems}} associated with evacuation of a train inside a tunnel for senior citizens and people with disabilities, and to identify possible technical installations that would aid their evacuation. A total of 19 people took part in the study, in which it was demonstrated that senior citizens and people with disabilities require either a smaller height difference than 1. 4 meter between the train and tunnel floor, or a technical installation, e. g., an <b>emergency</b> <b>ladder,</b> {{if they are to be}} able to exit a train safely during an evacuation inside a tunnel. Almost all participants stated that one or more handles would aid them during an evacuation, and many would like to have a fixed ladder or steps that can be ejected when evacuation is necessary. Due to the fact that more and more senior citizens and people with disabilities will be using the underground transportation system, future research must include this population in both evacuation experiments and design studies aimed at improving conditions for evacuees. The results presented in the present paper can be used as qualitative guidance for these studies...|$|E
40|$|An {{exploratory}} {{study of a}} train evacuation inside a tunnel was performed in order to {{study the effects of}} different train exit configurations on the flow rate of people through the exit. A total of 84 participants in the ages 18 – 40 years took part in the experiment, which was carried out on two separate days and involved 18 evacuation scenarios. The statistical analysis of the experiment demonstrated that the aver- age flow rate capacity of the train exit was. 3 persons per second and meter (p/s m) door width, including all scenarios. Four variables related to the train exit configuration were identified to significantly affect the flow rate of people: (1) a reduction of the train exit height increased the flow rate of people with on average. 026 p/s m; (2) a change of tunnel floor material from concrete to macadam increased the flow rate of people with on average. 015 p/s m; (3) an <b>emergency</b> <b>ladder</b> present in the train exit reduced the flow rate of people with on average. 064 p/s m; and (4) a complete failure of the lighting inside the train reduced the flow rate of people with on average. 029 p/s m. In addition, qualitative observations revealed a deferential behaviour among the participants in the train, caused by the people outside the train. It is therefore believed that the population density outside the train will significantly determine the flow rate capacity of the train exit during an evacuation...|$|E
50|$|On December 6, 2008 Michigan Tech Associate Professor William J. Gregg was {{installing}} <b>emergency</b> <b>ladders</b> in {{the mine}} shaft at the Number 2 Shaft House when he fell 225 feet and landed on an object and was declared dead at the scene by a paramedic who was lowered down to his location.|$|R
50|$|In spring 2011, the Club harbour gates were {{installed}} {{in response to}} the high water levels. A fixed crane, which was installed in September 2011 by the dinghy shed was used to complement the Hydraulic trailer in hauling in and out the club vessels. Harbour <b>emergency</b> <b>ladders</b> {{were installed}} at various points in the harbour. Evestrophing and stucco were installed.|$|R
5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish immigrants were disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed <b>emergency</b> <b>ladders.</b>|$|R
2500|$|On April 19, {{the company}} began the {{conversion}} of the former German ocean liner [...] into a U.S. Navy transport. The conversion involved the installation of 6,500 bunks, construction of a 1,000-seat messroom with over [...] of mess tables, construction of a 104-person sick bay, installation of new galley fixtures including coal ranges, bake ovens and 40- to 80-gallon kettles, installation of [...] of washbasins, the addition of 109 liferafts and 90 <b>emergency</b> <b>ladders,</b> and the conversion of all firehose connections to Navy standard. In addition, the ship's engines were given a complete overhaul, and eight freshwater tanks and the ship's portside lights were repaired. The original contract called for the work to be completed in two weeks, but by utilizing its [...] "man-a-minute" [...] hiring system developed during the war, the company was able to rapidly expand the workforce allocated to the ship from an initial 350 to almost 2,000, completing the work in only eleven days and earning the company another Navy letter of commendation.|$|R
500|$|At 5:20pm, rescuers {{first entered}} car 1079, the lead car of train 112. This car had telescoped over the rear {{car of the}} {{stationary}} train, trapping many passengers who required rescue by <b>emergency</b> workers using <b>ladders</b> for access. Survivors described the crash as [...] "like... hit a concrete wall," [...] with air clouded by smoke and debris, and panic among passengers when car doors did not immediately open.|$|R
50|$|The first Tu-114, {{registration}} CCCP-Л5611, {{was first}} {{shown to the}} West in 1958 at the Brussels World Exhibition. It later carried Nikita Khrushchev on {{his first trip to}} the US, the first such visit by any Soviet leader. When it arrived at Andrews Air Force Base, the ground crew found that the aircraft was so large and its landing gear so tall that they had no passenger steps high enough to reach the forward hatch. Khrushchev and his party were obliged to use the aircraft's own <b>emergency</b> escape <b>ladder.</b> The last flight of this particular plane was in 1968, and it is now on display at the Central Air Force Museum at Monino, outside of Moscow. Similar issues were experienced when the plane first landed at London and Paris airports, neither of which had hosted a plane of this size.|$|R
40|$|The Functional Task Tests (FTT) is an {{interdisciplinary}} study designed to correlate {{the changes in}} functional tasks (such as <b>emergency</b> egress, <b>ladder</b> climbing, and hatch opening) with changes in neuromuscular, cardiovascular, and sensorimotor function. One aspect of the FTT, the neuromuscular function test, is used to investigate the neuromuscular component underlying changes {{in the ability of}} astronauts to perform functional tasks (representative of critical mission tasks) safely and quickly after flight. PURPOSE: To describe neuromuscular function after short- and long-duration space flight. METHODS: To date, 5 crewmembers on short-duration (10 - to 15 -day) missions and 3 on long-duration missions have participated. Crewmembers were assessed 30 days before flight, on landing day (short-duration subjects only) and 1, 6, and 30 days after landing. The interpolated twitch technique, which utilizes a combination of maximal voluntary contractions and electrically evoked contractions, was used to assess the maximal voluntary isometric force (MIF) and central activation capacity of the knee extensors. Leg-press and bench-press devices were used to assess MIF and maximal dynamic power of the lower and upper body respectively. Specifically, power was measured during concentric-only ballistic throws of the leg-press sled and bench-press bar loaded to 40 % and 30 % of MIF respectively. RESULTS: Data are currently being collected from both Shuttle and ISS crewmembers. Emerging data indicate that measures of knee extensor muscle function are decreased with long-duration flight. DISCUSSION: The relationships between flight duration, neural drive, and muscle performance are of particular interest. Ongoing research will add to the current sample size and will focus on defining changes in muscle performance measures after long-duration space flight...|$|R
