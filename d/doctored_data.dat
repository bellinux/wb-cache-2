According to Patricia Callahan, the problem with these tests and the way they are interpreted is that, after administering a chelator to their patients, [...] "Doctor's Data...compared those drug-provoked results to a reference range calculated for people who had never been given a chelation drug." [...] In addition, they have faced considerable criticism from Stephen Barrett, who has described how provoked urine test reports are used to mislead patients. and has also written negatively about hair analysis in general, which he contends is [...] "unscientific, economically wasteful, and probably illegal."

40|$|Abstract: Previous {{studies have}} found a higher body-burden of toxic metals, {{particularly}} mercury (Hg), among subjects diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in comparison to neurotypical controls. Moreover, Hg body-burden was associated with ASD severity. This cross-sectional study examined the potential correlation between hair toxic metal concentrations and ASD severity in a prospective cohort of participants diagnosed with moderate to severe ASD. The Institutional Review Board at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas (Dallas, TX) approved the present study. Qualifying study participants (n = 18) were evaluated for ASD severity using the Childhood Autism Rating Scale (CARS) and quantitatively for arsenic, Hg, cadmium, lead, chromium, cobalt, nickel, aluminum, tin, uranium, and manganese using hair toxic element testing by <b>Doctor’s</b> <b>Data</b> (a CLIA-approved laboratory). CARS scoring and hair toxic element testing were blinded to one another. Increasing hair Hg concentrations significantly correlated with increased ASD severity.

40|$|Background: Potential adverse drug events (PADEs) {{are defined}} as being {{potentially}} harmful unintentional medication discrepancies. Discrepancies regarding medication history (MH) often occur when a patient is being admitted to a hospital???s emergency department (ED); they are clinically important and represent {{a significant source of}} data regarding adverse drug events occurring during emergency admission to hospital. This study sought to measure the impact of pharmacist-acquired MH during admission to an ED; it focused on whether a patient???s current home medication regimen being available for a doctor when consulting a patient in an ED would have reduced potential adverse drug events. Method: A multicentre, double-blind, randomised, controlled parallel-group study was carried out at 3 large teaching hospitals in Bogota, Colombia.

The pathway represented key characteristics of a professional project: achieving occupational autonomy and closure.

40|$|Abstract Background Despite the {{increasing}} demand for acupuncture and homoeopathy in Germany, {{little is known about}} the effects of these treatments in routine care. We set up a pragmatic documentation study in general practice funded within the scope of project launched by a German health insurer. Patients were followed-up for up to four years. Methods The aim of the project was to study the effects and benefits of acupuncture and/or homoeopathy, and to assess patient satisfaction within a prospective documentation of over 5000 acupuncture and over 900 homoeopathy patients. As data sources, we used the documentation made available by therapists on every individual visit and a standardised quality-of-life questionnaire (MOS SF- 36); these were complemented by questions concerning the patient's medical history and by questions on patient satisfaction. The health insurer provided us with data on work absenteeism. Results Descriptive analyses of the main outcomes showed benefit of treatment with middle to large-sized effects for the quality of life questionnaire SF- 36 and about 1 point improvement on a rating scale of effects, given by <b>doctors.</b> <b>Data</b> on the treatment and the patients' and physicians' background suggests chronically ill patients treated by fairly regular schemes.

40|$|Background: Mental and {{physical}} health problems are common in people with substance misuse problems and medications are often required in their management. Given the extent of prescribing for service users who attend specialist addiction services, {{it is important to}} consider how prescribers in this setting assess the appropriateness of service users' prescribed medications. Objective: To explore prescribers' views and experiences of assessing the appropriateness of medications prescribed for service users coming in for treatment as well as the differences between prescribers. Setting: A specialist addiction service in the North of England. Method: A phenomenological approach was adopted. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with four nurse prescribers and eight <b>doctors.</b> <b>Data</b> were analysed using thematic framework analysis. Main outcome measure: Prescribers' views and experiences of assessing the appropriateness of prescribed medications. Results: Assessment of the appropriateness of prescribed medications involved reviewing medications, assessing risk, history-taking, involvement of service users, and comparing guideline adherence and 'successful' prescribing. Doctors and nurse prescribers assessed the appropriateness of medications they considered to be within their competency. Doctors provided support to nurse prescribers and general practitioners (GPs) when dealing with issues around prescribing. Conclusion: Assessment of the appropriateness of prescribed medications is complex. The recent reduction in medical expertise in specialist addiction services may negatively impact on the clinical management of service users. It appears that there is a need for further training of nurse prescribers and GPs so they can provide optimal care to service users...|$|R
