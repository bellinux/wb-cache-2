5|$|As Q3 started, {{it became}} {{apparent}} that Lewis Hamilton would be unable to take part, suffering from a <b>hybrid</b> <b>system</b> failure in the turbo charger, the same problem that had plagued him in China two weeks earlier. Nico Rosberg went on to secure pole position, even though his last timed lap was compromised by a tyre lockup into turn 13. Sebastian Vettel was closest to Rosberg, but a five-place grid penalty meant that he would start the race from seventh on the grid, moving Valtteri Bottas into the first row. Kimi Räikkönen was fourth fastest, ahead of Massa, Ricciardo, Pérez, Kvyat and Verstappen. After qualifying, Mercedes decided to switch Hamilton's car back to his spare power unit, which had been rebuilt following its failure at the Chinese Grand Prix, thereby avoiding a grid penalty, which they would have incurred if a new power unit would have been installed. Williams were satisfied with their pace in qualifying, praising the advances they made in slow-corner speed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>systems</b> are {{models for}} complex {{physical}} systems {{and have become}} a widely used concept for understanding their behavior. Many applications are safety-critical, including car, railway, and air traffic control, robotics, physical-chemical process control, and biomedical devices. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>systems</b> analysis studies how we can build computerised controllers for physical systems which are guaranteed to meet their design goals. The continuous dynamics of <b>hybrid</b> <b>systems</b> can be modeled by differential equations, the discrete dynamics {{by a combination of}} discrete state-transitions and conditional execution. The discrete and continuous dynamics interact to form <b>hybrid</b> <b>systems,</b> which makes them quite challenging for verification. In this tutorial, we survey state-of-the-art verification techniques for <b>hybrid</b> <b>systems.</b> In particular, we focus on a coherent logical approach for systematic <b>hybrid</b> <b>systems</b> analysis. We survey theory, practice, and applications, and show how <b>hybrid</b> <b>systems</b> can be verified in the <b>hybrid</b> <b>systems</b> verification tool KeYmaera. KeYmaera has been used successfully to verify safety, reactivity, controllability, and liveness properties, including collision freedom in air traffic, car, and railway control systems.
