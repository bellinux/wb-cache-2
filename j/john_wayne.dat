5|$|In 1962, Hawks made Hatari!, {{again with}} <b>John</b> <b>Wayne,</b> {{who plays a}} big-game hunter in Africa. In 1964, Hawks made his final comedy, Man's Favorite Sport?, {{starring}} Rock Hudson (since Cary Grant felt {{he was too old}} for the role) and Paula Prentiss. Hawks then returned to his childhood passion for car races with Red Line 7000 in 1965, featuring a young James Caan in his first leading role. Hawks's final two films were both Western remakes of Rio Bravo starring <b>John</b> <b>Wayne.</b> In 1966, Hawks directed El Dorado, starring Wayne, Robert Mitchum and Caan, which was released the following year. He then made Rio Lobo, with Wayne in 1970.|$|E

5|$|The route {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with SR 84 west of Stanfield. SR 347 then heads northward as <b>John</b> <b>Wayne</b> Parkway, a four-lane expressway, which SR 347 is for its entirety, through a desert landscape. After intersecting Meadowview Road and crossing a canal, SR 347 meets Carefree Place, where a farm appears {{to the west}} part of the road. At Clayton Road, {{the east side of}} the road becomes farmland as well. <b>John</b> <b>Wayne</b> Parkway enters the Ak-Chin Indian Community, passing the Harrah's Ak-Chin Casino, and intersects BIA Route 14 within this community. At Route 14, the route becomes Maricopa Road, but retains its name as <b>John</b> <b>Wayne</b> Parkway, as it heads toward Maricopa. Continuing on its northerly path, the road exits the Indian community with a residential area to the west and desert to the east. Past Bowlin road, this orientation switches, as the residential area is located on the east side of Maricopa Road. The arrangement of the landscape switches again at Desert Cedars Road, where the road passes the Maricopa First Baptist Church. Before meeting the Maricopa-Casa Grande Highway, the road passes Maricopa High School. It also meets an at-grade intersection with a rail line, owned by Union Pacific.|$|E

5|$|During the 1940s and 1950s, over 100 western {{movies were}} filmed in nearby Sedona and Oak Creek Canyon. The Hotel Monte Vista in Flagstaff hosted many film stars during this era, {{including}} Jane Russell, Gary Cooper, Spencer Tracy, <b>John</b> <b>Wayne,</b> and Bing Crosby.

5|$|Maureen O'Hara (born Maureen FitzSimons; 17 August 192024 October 2015) was an Irish-born American {{actress and}} singer. The famously {{red-headed}} O'Hara {{was known for}} her beauty and playing fiercely passionate but sensible heroines, often in westerns and adventure films. She worked on numerous occasions with director John Ford and longtime friend <b>John</b> <b>Wayne,</b> {{and was one of}} the last surviving stars from the Golden Age of Hollywood.|$|E
5|$|While filming Silver Streak, Wilder {{began working}} on a script for The World's Greatest Lover, {{inspired}} by Fellini's The White Sheik.

The film was to star <b>John</b> <b>Wayne,</b> but he dropped out {{and was replaced by}} Harrison Ford, then an up-and-coming actor.|$|E

5|$|In 1948, Hawks made Red River, an epic western {{reminiscent}} of Mutiny on the Bounty starring <b>John</b> <b>Wayne</b> and Montgomery Clift {{in his first}} film. Later that year, Hawks remade his earlier film Ball of Fire as A Song Is Born, this time starring Danny Kaye and Virginia Mayo. This version follows the same plot but pays more attention to popular jazz music and includes such jazz legends as Tommy Dorsey, Benny Goodman, Louis Armstrong, Lionel Hampton, and Benny Carter playing themselves. In 1949, Hawks reteamed with Cary Grant in the screwball comedy I Was a Male War Bride, also starring Ann Sheridan.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Peter {{spends the}} rest of the episode working in an improv comedy group with Quagmire and Joe. Quagmire {{attempts}} to educate the others on the fine art of improv comedy but when they try to do a live show, Peter's lack of conscious comedic knowledge completely gives way to his <b>John</b> <b>Wayne</b> impersonations, which the audience finds hilarious. This, along with Joe's fecal incontinence, forces Quagmire to end the show early and conclude {{that this is something that}} should never have been attempted.|$|E
5|$|The section {{north of}} Maricopa, toward present day I-10, {{was built by}} 1939. The road headed north toward Tempe to U.S. Route 80. Between 1951 and 1958, the road was {{extended}} south to its current terminus at SR 84; at this time, I-10 had still not been built, nor had the route become a numbered route. By 1971, I-10 was finished through {{the south and east}} edges of the Phoenix area. In 1989, ADOT made preparations to establish the number along Maricopa Road and reserved the right-of-way along the parkway. This may have been because of a controversy over the name of <b>John</b> <b>Wayne</b> Parkway, which the road was dubbed at the time. The Gila River Native Americans, whose reservation the parkway ran on, did not want this name, as <b>John</b> <b>Wayne,</b> the actor who formerly owned a ranch on the road, had appeared in several movies in which he had killed Native Americans. In 1997, the route was officially established as a state highway with its current routing. SR 347 was widened from a two-lane road to the four-lane expressway that it is today.|$|E

5|$|From their {{beginnings}} to {{the present}} day, B movies have provided opportunities both for those {{coming up in the}} profession and others whose careers are waning. Celebrated filmmakers such as Anthony Mann and Jonathan Demme learned their craft in B movies. They are where actors such as <b>John</b> <b>Wayne</b> and Jack Nicholson first became established, and they have provided work for former A movie actors, such as Vincent Price and Karen Black. Some actors, such as Bela Lugosi, Eddie Constantine and Pam Grier, worked in B movies for most of their careers. The term B actor is sometimes used to refer to a performer who finds work primarily or exclusively in B pictures.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} days of the campaign, Douglas finally began to receive some of the support she had hoped for. Boddy's paper {{endorsed}} her, while Truman praised her. Douglas's actor husband, Melvyn Douglas, on tour with the play Two Blind Mice throughout the campaign, spoke out on behalf of his wife, as did movie stars Myrna Loy and Eddie Cantor. Nixon had several Hollywood personalities supporting him, including Howard Hughes, Cecil B. DeMille and <b>John</b> <b>Wayne.</b> Another actor, Ronald Reagan, was among Douglas's supporters, but when his girlfriend and future wife Nancy Davis took him to a pro-Nixon rally led by actress ZaSu Pitts, he was converted to Nixon's cause and led quiet fundraising for him. Douglas was apparently unaware of this—30years later she mentioned Reagan in her memoirs as someone who worked hard for her.|$|E
5|$|MacArthur {{subsequently}} nominated Bulkeley for the Medal of Honor. The Commander in Chief, U.S. Fleet, Admiral Ernest King was {{not going}} to let MacArthur award the Medal of Honor to a naval officer, so he wrote a citation for Bulkeley on behalf of the Navy. Roosevelt presented it to Bulkeley in a ceremony in the Oval Office on 4 August 1942. Bulkeley wrote a book about his exploits, entitled They Were Expendable. Parts were serialized in Reader's Digest and Life magazines and it became a bestseller in 1942. In 1944, it was adapted as a movie of the same name, with Robert Montgomery playing a character based on Bulkeley, <b>John</b> <b>Wayne</b> one based on Kelly, and Donna Reed in the role of an Army nurse with whom Kelly had a brief liaison. Postwar analysis found that most of the book's claims were exaggerated.|$|E

5|$|North of this highway, SR 347 passes Honeycutt Road {{and passes}} by the Pinal County Justice Court. After an {{intersection}} with Edison Road, SR 347 passes several businesses before intersecting SR 238, named Smith Enke Road. The route then enters another residential area before abruptly passing into the desert. The road turns more northeasterly, heading through the Gila River Indian Community. Turning back north and slightly northeast again, the road crosses from Pinal County into Maricopa County. After intersecting Riggs Road, Maricopa Road veers away from <b>John</b> <b>Wayne</b> Parkway, which SR 347 follows. Now as Queen Creek Road, {{which serves as}} another name, SR 347 heads east for a small distance, ending at a diamond interchange at I-10's exit 164. Queen Creek Road continues toward Chandler Municipal Airport.|$|E
5|$|True Grit is a 2010 American Western film {{directed}} by the Coen brothers. It is the second adaptation of Charles Portis' 1968 novel of the same name, which was previously released in 1969 featuring <b>John</b> <b>Wayne.</b> The 2010 version stars Jeff Bridges, Hailee Steinfeld and Matt Damon. It was released by Paramount Pictures in the United States and Canada on December22, 2010, grossing over USD $25.6 million at the box office, twice its pre-release projections, in its opening weekend. Since then it has made over USD $171 million domestically and USD $249 million worldwide. The film was well received by movie critics, with an approval rating of 96 percent on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes. It has appeared {{in more than a}} dozen movie reviewers' Top Ten lists for the best movies of the year.|$|E
5|$|In 1954, she {{was then}} {{cast in the}} epic The Prodigal (1955), {{followed}} by the <b>John</b> <b>Wayne</b> adventure film The Sea Chase (1955), which Turner shot in Hawaii. After starring in the period drama Diane (1956), MGM opted not to renew Turner's contract. This was a difficult time for Hollywood's major studios because a recent court decision forced them to divest themselves of their movie theaters. In addition, television had caught on in a big way; the public was staying home. Turner {{was just one of}} MGM's star roster to be let go. Her career recovered briefly after she appeared in the hugely successful big-screen adaptation of Grace Metalious's best-selling novel, Peyton Place (1957), for which she was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress. Another few box-office failures followed (Another Time, Another Place, for example) when the 1958 scandal surrounding her daughter's killing of Johnny Stompanato threatened to derail her career completely.|$|E
