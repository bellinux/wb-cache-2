5|$|References to {{mourning}} doves appear frequently <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> literature. Mourning dove imagery also {{turns up}} in contemporary American and Canadian poetry {{in the work}} of poets as diverse as Robert Bly, Jared Carter, Lorine Niedecker, and Charles Wright.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> mythology, the bobcat {{is often}} twinned with {{the figure of}} the coyote in a theme of duality. Lynx and coyote are {{associated}} with the fog and wind, respectively—two elements representing opposites <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> folklore. This basic story, in many variations, is found in the native cultures of North America (with parallels in South America), but they diverge in the telling. One version, which appears in the Nez Perce folklore for instance, depicts lynx and coyote as opposed, antithetical beings. However, another version depicts them with equality and identicality. Claude Lévi-Strauss argues the former concept, that of twins representing opposites, is an inherent theme in New World mythologies, but they are not equally balanced figures, representing an open-ended dualism rather than the symmetric duality of Old World cultures. The latter notion then, Lévi-Strauss suggests, is the result of regular contact between Europeans and native cultures. Additionally, the version found in the Nez Perce story is of much greater complexity, while the version of equality seems to have lost the tale's original meaning.|$|E

5|$|Condor bones {{have been}} found <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> graves, as have condor feather headdresses. Cave {{paintings}} of condors have also been discovered. Some tribes ritually killed condors to make ceremonial clothing out of their feathers. Shamans then danced while wearing these to reach {{the upper and lower}} spiritual worlds. Whenever a shaman died, his clothes were said to be cursed, so new clothing had to be made for his successor. Some scientists, such as Noel Snyder, believe that this process of making ceremonial clothing contributed to the condor's decline.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, Jack Thorpe filed {{a federal}} {{lawsuit against the}} borough of Jim Thorpe, seeking to have his father's remains {{returned}} to his homeland and re-interred near other family members in Oklahoma. Citing the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act, Jack was arguing to bring his father's remains to the reservation in Oklahoma, {{where they would be}} buried near those of his father, sisters and brother, a mile from the place he was born. He claimed that the agreement between his stepmother and Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, borough officials was made against the wishes of other family members who want him buried <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> land. Jack Thorpe died at 73 on February 22, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Menominee Tribe v. United States is a {{landmark}} case <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> law, {{primarily in the}} area of reserved tribal rights. It has been used in college courses to explain tribal sovereignty rights and that tribes retain some rights even if the tribe has been terminated, as the Menominee tribe was. The decision in the case has affected subsequent legislation, such as the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, in which Congress expressly extinguished all aboriginal rights. The case has been discussed internationally, for example in Australia regarding the relevance of indigenous or aboriginal title.|$|E

5|$|The American robin {{has a place}} <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> mythology. The {{story of}} how the robin got its red breast by fanning the dying flames of a campfire to save a Native American man and a boy is similar to those that {{surround}} the European robin. The Tlingit people of Northwestern North America held it to be a culture hero created by Raven to please the people with its song. One of the houses of the Raven Tribe from the Nisga'a Nation holds the robin as a house crest.|$|E
5|$|The coyote is a {{prominent}} character <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> folklore, {{mainly in the}} Southwestern United States and Mexico, usually depicted as a trickster that alternately assumes {{the form of an}} actual coyote or a man. As with other trickster figures, the coyote uses deception and humor to rebel against social conventions. The animal was especially respected in Mesoamerican cosmology as a symbol of military might. After the European colonization of the Americas, it was reviled in Anglo-American culture as a cowardly and untrustworthy animal. Unlike wolves (gray, eastern, or red), which have undergone an improvement of their public image, attitudes towards the coyote remain largely negative.|$|E
5|$|The cunning Fox is {{commonly}} found <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> mythology, {{where it is}} portrayed as an almost constant companion to Coyote. Fox, however, is a deceitful companion that often steals Coyote's food. In the Achomawi creation myth, Fox and Coyote are the co-creators of the world, that leave just {{before the arrival of}} humans. The Yurok tribe believed that Fox, in anger, captured the sun, and tied him to a hill, causing him to burn a great hole in the ground. An Inuit story tells of how Fox, portrayed as a beautiful woman, tricks a hunter into marrying her, only to resume her true form and leave after he offends her. A Menominee story tells of how Fox is an untrustworthy friend to the Wolf.|$|E

5|$|The gharial is {{featured}} in the folk tales of India. In one story, a gharial and a monkey become friends when the monkey gives the gharial fruit. The gharial's wife demands that her husband bring home the monkey to eat, believing that the fruit made the monkey's heart sweet. The gharial complies at first and attempts to lure the monkey to his home, but soon comes clean about the plan. Their friendship ends after that.

5|$|The {{sea mink}} (Neovison macrodon) is a {{recently}} extinct species of mink {{from the eastern}} coast of North America in the family Mustelidae, the largest family in the order Carnivora. It was most {{closely related to the}} American mink (Neovison vison), with debate {{about whether or not the}} sea mink should be considered a subspecies of the American mink (making it Neovison vison macrodon) or a species of its own. The main justification for a separate species designation is the size difference between the two minks, but other distinctions have been made, such as its redder fur. The only known remains are fragments unearthed <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> shell middens. Its actual size is speculative, based largely on tooth remains.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights {{released}} an advisory opinion {{calling for an}} end to the use of Native American images and team names by non-Native schools. While recognizing the right to freedom of expression, the commission also recognizes those Native Americans and civil rights advocates that maintain these mascots, by promoting stereotypes, may violate anti-discrimination laws. When found in educational institutions, mascots may also create a hostile environment inconsistent with learning to respect diverse cultures, but instead teach that stereotypes that misrepresent a minority group are permissible. Those schools that claim that their sports imagery stimulate interest <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> culture have not listened to Native groups and civil rights leaders who point out that even purportedly positive stereotypes both present a false portrayal of the past and prevent understanding of contemporary Native people as fellow Americans.|$|E
40|$|While the {{efficacy}} {{and safety of}} coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) {{has been established in}} several clinical trials, little is known about its outcomes <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans.</b> MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: We assessed clinical outcomes associated with CABG <b>in</b> 155 <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> using a national database of 18, 061 patients from 25 nongovernmental, not-for-profit U. S. health care facilities. Patients were classified into five groups: 1) <b>Native</b> <b>American,</b> 2) white, 3) African American, 4) Hispanic, and 5) Asian. We evaluated for ethnic differences in in-hospital mortality and length of stay, and after adjusting for age, gender, surgical priority, case-mix severity, insurance status, and facility characteristics (volume, location, and teaching status). Overall, we found the adjusted risk for in-hospital death to be higher <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> when compared to whites (odds ratio [OR], 3. 8; 95 % confidence interval [CI], 1. 5 to 9. 8), African Americans (OR, 3. 4; 95 % CI, 1. 1 to 9. 9), Hispanics (OR, 7. 1; 95 % CI, 2. 5 to 20. 3), and Asians (OR, 2. 8; 95 % CI, 1. 1 to 7. 0). No significant differences were found in length of stay after adjustment across ethnic groups. CONCLUSIONS: The risk of in-hospital death following CABG may be higher <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> than <b>in</b> other ethnic groups. Given the small number of <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> the database (n = 155), however, further research will be needed to confirm these findings...|$|R

30|$|An {{environmental}} factor involves infant transport and clothing. DDH was very high <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> <b>in</b> earlier studies [6, 73], due to tight swaddling {{of the infant}} <b>in</b> most <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> societies. There was a 10 -fold increase in DDH (123.0 vs. 12.6) <b>in</b> Canadian <b>Native</b> <b>Americans</b> when infants were placed in a cradleboard [74]. Such tight swaddling is less common in today’s North American societies. Hispanics in this country possess the <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> genes for DDH, but which is no longer exacerbated by tight swaddling. This can explain why the proportion of DDH in Hispanics is higher than in Caucasians, but {{not as high as}} <b>in</b> earlier <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> studies. The opposite likely occurs in United States Black children. In traditional African cultures, children are not swaddled, but, rather, abducted across the mother’s pelvis, which protects the infant from DDH. In North America, Black children are not carried in such an abducted position, but, rather, transported in manners similar to Caucasians (e.g., standard baby strollers and car seats), where the hips are not markedly abducted, but neither tightly swaddled.|$|R
5|$|There are no {{credible}} {{descriptions of}} smallpox-like {{disease in the}} Americas before the westward exploration by Europeans in the 15th century AD. Smallpox was introduced into the Caribbean island of Hispaniola in 1509, and into the mainland in 1520, when Spanish settlers from Hispaniola arrived in Mexico bringing smallpox with them. Smallpox devastated the native Amerindian population and was {{an important factor in}} the conquest of the Aztecs and the Incas by the Spaniards. Settlement of the east coast of North America in 1633 in Plymouth, Massachusetts was also accompanied by devastating outbreaks of smallpox among Native American populations, and subsequently among the native-born colonists. Case fatality rates during outbreaks <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> populations were as high as 80–90%. Smallpox was introduced into Australia in 1789 and again in 1829. Although the disease was never endemic on the continent, it was the principal cause of death in Aboriginal populations between 1780 and 1870.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the 1970s, the CTW's main non-television efforts {{changed from}} {{promotion}} {{to the development}} of educational materials for preschool settings. Early efforts included mobile viewing units that broadcast the show in the inner cities, in Appalachia, <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> <b>American</b> communities, and in migrant worker camps. During the early 1980s, the CTW created the Preschool Education Program (PEP), whose goal was to assist preschools, by combining television viewing, books, hands-on activities, and other media, in using the series as an educational resource. The Workshop also provided materials to non-English speaking children and adults. Starting during 2006, the Workshop expanded its programs by creating a series of PBS specials and DVDs largely concerning how military deployment affects the families of soldiers. Other efforts by the Workshop concerned families of prisoners, health and wellness, and safety.|$|E
