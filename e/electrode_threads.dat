40|$|Non-thermal plasma (NTP) {{has been}} {{introduced}} {{over the last few}} years as a promising after- treatment system for nitrogen oxides and particulate matter removal from diesel exhaust. NTP technology has not been commercialised as yet, due to its high rate of energy consumption. Therefore, it is important to seek out new methods to improve NTP performance. Residence time is a crucial parameter in engine exhaust emissions treatment. In this paper, different electrode shapes are analysed and the corresponding residence time and NOx removal efficiency are studied. An axisymmetric laminar model is used for obtaining residence time distribution numerically using FLUENT software. If the mean residence time in a NTP plasma reactor increases, there will be a corresponding increase in the reaction time and consequently the pollutant removal efficiency increases. Three different screw <b>thread</b> <b>electrodes</b> and a rod electrode are examined. The results show the advantage of screw <b>thread</b> <b>electrodes</b> in comparison with the rod electrode. Furthermore, between the screw <b>thread</b> <b>electrodes,</b> the <b>electrode</b> with the <b>thread</b> width of 1 mm has the highest NOx removal due to higher residence time and a greater number of micro-discharges. The results show that the residence time of the screw <b>thread</b> <b>electrode</b> with a <b>thread</b> width of 1 mm is 21 % more than for the rod electrode...|$|R

The machines vary from simple mechanisms to exceptionally complicated units. Monitoring the condition of large upset welding machines in operating industries has attracted increasing interest in recent years owing {{to the need for}} decreasing the energy consumption on production machinery and for reducing the extent of secondary damage caused by failures.

A pseudo-spark based high {{repetition}} {{pulse generator}} is used, and a rapid charger (3 µF) {{is used for}} repetitive discharge, {{and the frequency of}} typical discharge is 10 kHz.

40|$|Fiber-shaped {{supercapacitor}} (FSC) is {{a promising}} energy storage device for wearable/stretchable electronics {{by virtue of}} its unique features such as high flexibility, knittability, small-size and lightweight. However, the energy density of most FSC devices is limited by the relatively low operating voltage. Herein, we develop a solid-state asymmetric fiber-shaped supercapacitor made of carbon fiber thread@polyaniline and functionalized carbon fiber <b>thread</b> <b>electrodes</b> with high operating voltage (1. 6 V). The as-prepared device shows a volumetric energy density up to 2 mWh cm(- 3) which is higher than/compatible to most reported FSCs. The maximum power density of the device is 11 W cm(- 3), which is comparable to typical commercial supercapacitors. Other than good rate capability, long cycle life and high volumetric capacitance, the proposed device has excellent flexibility. It can be embedded in a glove using a traditional weaving technology without degrading its capacitive performance at various bending conditions. To demonstrate the potential of our supercapacitor for stretchable electronics, we incorporate the device into a conventional elastic thread to form a stretchable supercapacitor. The capacitance of the stretchable device is well maintained even after stretching up to 100 %, demonstrating its excellent stretchability.

Dangerous microorganisms and microbes should be destructed in plasma region due to summary effect of produced ozone, irradiation of hard UV and generated active species. Dielectric barrier discharges (DBD) develop with sufficiently high electrical field in the gas area of an arrangement {{with at least one}} insulation barrier between two electrodes. DBD plasma exists in the form of numerous temporally non-stationary, locally filamentary micro discharges. DBD arrangement at the air by atmospheric pressure presents a low-cost alternative to conventional plasma reactors. Grid DBD arrangement consists of some warp <b>thread</b> <b>electrodes,</b> which are weaved together with weft thread ones. As power supply for the barrier arrangement serves a pulse generator, which supplies the arrangement with sinusoidal pulse trains or continuous alternating voltages. This generator functions resonance-dependently in a frequency range from 10 kHz to 60 kHz. The light appearances of barrier discharges are investigated {{with the help of a}} CCD high-speed camera. The wire fabric shows a stable plasma generation in all stitchers, the cross points of the wires. For the optimisation of the plasma generation the different electrical parameters can be varied in wide range, to these parameters belong the pulse duration, the frequency of the generator as well as the pulse to pulse time. Dissipated energy of discharges rises from 5 μJ up to 100 μJ per period in the applied voltage range of 200 – 500 V using sine voltage of 60 kHz. Investigated Grid DBD shows a stable operation in wide range of applied voltage. Such a wire fabric enables the generation of plasma-active species at one atmosphere.

40|$|Aim To {{develop an}} {{electromyography}} method for pregnant rat uterus in vivo and to separate myometrial {{signals from the}} gastrointestinal tract signals. Methods: Pregnant Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 8) were anaesthetized and their stomach, small intestine, and large intestine {{were removed from the}} abdomen. A pair of <b>thread</b> <b>electrodes</b> was inserted into the uterus, while a pair of disk electrodes was placed subcutaneously above the myometrium. Additionally, a strain gauge sensor was fixed {{on the surface of the}} myometrium and cecum for the parallel detection of mechanical contractions in rats (n = 18) with intact gastrointestinal tract. The filtered electric signals were amplified and recorded by an online computer system and analyzed by fast Fourier transformation. The frequency of the electric activity was characterized by cycle per minute (cpm), the magnitude of the activity was described as power spectrum density maximum (PsDmax). Results: The frequency of the pregnant uterine activity was 1 - 3 cpm, which falls within the same range as that of cecum. Measuring by both electrodes, oxytocin (1 μg/kg) increased and terbutaline (50 μg/kg) decreased the PsDmax by 25 %- 50 % (P < 0. 001) and 25 %- 40 % (P < 0. 01), respectively. We found a strong positive correlation between the alterations of PsDmax values and the strain gauge sensordetected mechanical contractions (area under curve). The GI specific compounds (neostigmine, atropine) mainly affected the cecal activity, while myometrium specific drugs (oxytocin, terbutaline) influenced the myometrial signals only. Conclusion: Our method proved to be able to detect the myoelectric activity that reflects the mechanical contraction. The overlapping myometrial and cecal signals are not separable, but they can be distinguished based on the much higher activity and different pharmacological reactivity of the pregnant uterus. Thus, the early signs of contractions can be detected and labor may be predicted in a fast and sensitive way...|$|R
40|$|PolyU Library Call No. : [THS] LG 51. H 577 M AP 2016 Jinxi, 134 pages :color illustrationsA {{supercapacitor}} (SC) is {{an energy}} storage component which has many advantages {{such as high}} power density, very fast charge and discharge rate and long cycle life. Supercapacitors using solid-state electrolyte are flexible, environmentally friendly, and light weight. However, their performance is still limited by several issues such as low active material loading per unit area, low operating voltage, low energy density, complicated fabrication process and poor integrated ability. To overcome these limitations, several methods were conducted in this research to improve the capacitance, fabrication process, operating voltage, and integrated ability. First, a simple oxidation and annealing method was introduced to fabricate functionalized carbon fabric (FCF) electrodes. The as-prepared FCF electrode could be operated at both negative potential and positive potential. Furthermore, a flexible symmetric solid-state supercapacitor with large operating voltage (1. 6 V) and high volumetric capacitance was successfully developed. The volumetric energy density and volumetric power density are higher than most previously reported CF-based SCs. Next, the focus of research is turned to fiber-based supercapacitors as they have higher integrated ability than fabric-based supercapacitors. A high-performance and flexible fiber-shaped supercapacitor (FSC) with organic-inorganic hybrid structure was fabricated. After adding {{a thin layer of}} polyaniline (PANI) on the manganese oxide (MnO₂) -coated carbon fiber <b>thread</b> (CFT) <b>electrode,</b> the capacitance of the electrode was increased by 2530 %. These CFT-MnO₂-PANI hybrid electrodes were further assembled into solid-state FSCs which exhibited high volumetric capacitance, good rate capability and excellent mechanical stability. Energy density has a squared dependency on operating voltage. Herein, a solid-state asymmetric fiber-shaped supercapacitor made of carbon fiber thread@polyaniline and functionalized carbon fiber <b>thread</b> <b>electrodes</b> was developed. The as-prepared device showed a high operating voltage (1. 6 V), high volumetric energy density and good flexibility. To optimize the capacitance of fiber-based asymmetric supercapacitor, carbon nanoparticles coated on carbon fiber (CF@CNPs) was chosen as the substrate owing to its notable features. The manganese oxide nanosheet grown on CF@CNPs and functionalized CF@CNPs were employed as the positive and negative electrode of the micro-asymmetric SC respectively. The as-prepared asymmetric SC can operate at 1. 8 V and exhibit a high volumetric energy density of 2. 1 mWh cm⁻³, which is comparable to that of a thin-film Li-battery. The final work of this research project was to develop a promising method for making supercapacitors to overcome the complicated fabrication process and polluted by-products caused by the electrochemical deposition method. An efficient and convenient method was developed to deposit a highly uniform and semi-transparent MnO₂ film by suppressing the coffee-ring effect (CRE) for transparent capacitive energy storage devices. By carefully controlling the amount of ethanol added in the MnO₂ droplet, we could optimize the film uniformity. Comparison measurements for the devices with or without CRE were carefully conducted, showing the efficiency and necessity of the method. The SC device without CRE shows a superior capacitance, high rate capability and lower contact resistance. This device could be used for both flexible and rigid applications, demonstrating its potential for flexible self-powered systems and capacitive energy storage window. Department of Applied PhysicsM.
