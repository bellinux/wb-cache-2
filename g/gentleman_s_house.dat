40|$|Objective High-risk antepartum {{patients}} {{often require}} long and costly hospitalization. The Mother 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>House</b> facility {{has been used}} to house antepartum women on hospital property as an alternative to inpatient management. This study looked at the cost effectiveness of this facility. Study Design A retrospective chart review on occupants (n = 3 D 111) of the Mother 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>House</b> from 2003 - 2005 was performed. Admission, discharge, and outcome data were collected. A comparison of the cost of management at the Mother 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>House</b> with the estimated cost of inpatient management was then performed. Results A cost savings of 2. 1 million was seen over a 3 -year period {{with the use of the}} Mother 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>House.</b> Demographic data show that patients with positive drug screens are more likely to fail Mother 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>House</b> management. Conclusion The Mother 9 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>House</b> is a cost effective alternative to inpatient management of some antepartum patients.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine the {{existence}} of a U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> price bubble. Specifically, we focus on the time series statistical relationship between real U. <b>S.</b> and regional <b>house</b> prices and a number of fundamental economic variables related to house prices using quarterly data from the first quarter of 1975 through the second-quarter of 2005, the approximate end of the recent house price rise. We find that U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> prices and our fundamental economic variables are unit root variables that are not cointegrated, even after allowing for structural breaks. Thus our analysis confirms the existence of an interesting and important anomaly suggested by some prior research on this period. We then discuss the implications of our results for the common practice of using error correction models of house prices, and for the current policy debate regarding the causes of the recent U. <b>S.</b> <b>housing</b> market collapse.

40|$|Abstract: The U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> {{price boom}} {{has been linked}} to an {{unsustainable}} easing of mortgage lending standards. However, time series models of U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> prices ignore changes in mortgage lending standards and perform poorly in the 2000 s. We incorporate data on mortgage standards for first time buyers into a model of US house prices based on the (inverted) demand for housing services. Our first time buyer loan-to-value series is weakly exogenous. It captures shifts in the supply of mortgage credit and not expectations of future house price appreciation. Using this series, we estimate a U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> price equation that yields a stable long-run cointegrating relationship, plausible income and price elasticities and an improved fit. Our findings suggest that swings in credit standards played a major, if not the major, role in driving the recent boom and bust in U. <b>S.</b> <b>house</b> prices...|$|R

40|$|Housing {{and land}} prices in China have {{increased}} continuously and dramatically {{for the past}} two decades. In fact, housing price growth has significantly outstripped income growth.

40|$|The key aim of {{this project}} carried out by Terry Burke and Robin Zhakarov {{was to develop a}} small number of {{scenarios}} about the nature of Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>housing</b> system at a specified future date. As such, the project involved the development of a significant exercise in strategic foresight about alternative futures for Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>housing,</b> the conditions and policies which would support these futures, and the implications for research and policy. The project drew on the literature and experiences of the field of foresight studies, a creative field of investigation, analysis and postulation to develop scenarios that help prepare organisations and nations for possibilities and challenges. The project applied foresight methodology to the issues of Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> broader <b>housing</b> system, examining the effect of major economic, technological and social trends, and exploring alternative policy pathways on a future housing system. In analysing the implications of scenarios, questions of winners and losers, impact on ecologically sustainable communities and implications for and impacts of government interventions are explored. A secondary aim of the project was to run a collaborative dialogue across a wide range of players in housing policy in all sectors, particularly those within AHURI. Questions that emerged from this project are: What do we understand are the key trends and influences on Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>housing</b> system? What are the interrelationships between key trends and influences on Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>housing</b> system? What possibilities can we anticipate for Australia 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>housing</b> system in the next 10, 20 or 30 years?

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{options for}} reforming the U. <b>S.</b> <b>housing</b> finance system {{in view of}} the failure of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac as government sponsored enterprises (GSEs). The options considered include GSE reform, a range of possible new governmental mortgage guarantee plans, and greater reliance on private mortgage markets. The analysis also considers the likely consequences of adopting alternative roles for government in the U. <b>S.</b> <b>housing</b> and mortgage markets. We start by reviewing the history of the GSEs and their contributions to the operation of U. <b>S.</b> <b>housing</b> and mortgage markets, including the actions that led to their failure in conjunction with the recent mortgage market crisis. The reform options we consider include those proposed in a 2011 U. S.

40|$|The regression-discontinuity (RD) {{design has}} {{experienced}} a resurgence of interest in many fields, including political science. Following David Lee’s pioneering work on the incumbency advantage in U. <b>S.</b> <b>House</b> elections, many scholars have begun to apply RD designs to popular elections. Under certain assumptions, the RD design yields causal estimates that approach the gold standard of randomized experiments. There are good reasons to believe, however, that outcomes of narrowly decided U. S. Congressional elections are anything but random. Consistent with this notion, we demonstrate that bare winners and bare losers in U. <b>S.</b> <b>House</b> elections exhibit dramatic differences on key pretreatment covariates. Bare winners have substantially more financial resources than candidates who just lose and {{are far more likely}} to belong to the party that won the previous election in the district. Congressional Quarterly’s pre-election race ratings predict the outcomes of even extremely close elections with a high degree of accuracy. Close House elections are so predictable that it is impossible to achieve covariate balance between matched treated and control observations. We show that post-election recounts do not change election results often enough to account for the large imbalances in pre-election covariates that we observe. We conclude that bare winners and bare losers in U. <b>S.</b> <b>House</b> elections are not exchangeable ex ante. Therefore, the RD design is not valid in the case of U. <b>S.</b> <b>House</b> elections...|$|R
