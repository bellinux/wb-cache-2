They also produced long-form magazine-style feature articles, invested in video content, and chose to let their review scores be updated as the game changed.|$|E

5|$|The {{party was}} {{according}} to political scientist Cas Mudde only very rarely accused of anti-Semitism – and even then, it was strongly condemned {{by the party}} leadership.

The party also took screening measures against its local candidates to reveal any possible extremist connections, and rather wanted to risk not being able to fill its lists, rather than filling them with extremists. Particularly, the party wanted to distance <b>itself</b> <b>from</b> Holocaust denial, as it actively sought to reach out to Jewish voters in Antwerp.|$|E

To prevent <b>itself</b> <b>from</b> being swept away, it attaches itself with byssal threads to the host's throat. The sea cucumber is unharmed.|$|E
