5|$|Allan Arkush and Kring {{revealed}} {{in an interview}} on The Post Show that many parts of the finale were re-shot due to the Writers' Strike. Kring and Arkush commented that they re-shot the scene in which Peter telekenetically caught the virus. In the original cut, the virus was to shatter and be released. Kring admitted that the virus being released was to play a huge role in Volume 3, however, they decided to go into a different direction and re-shoot the ending, allowing Peter to catch the virus and destroy it. Kring also commented that the scenes where Matt, Peter and Nathan were talking in the vault were rewritten in and added later, as well as the Press Conference scene and the scene with Angela Petrelli talking on the cell phone. Kring and Arkush stated that the ending had to be rewritten and re-shot because they did not <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> show would return to air, due to the Writer's Strike, and they {{wanted to make sure that}} they tied up all the loose ends.|$|E
5|$|Homing on the enemy's {{broadcasts}} {{meant that}} there was no accurate way to calculate the range to the target; radar ranging measurements are based on timing the delay between broadcast and reception, {{and there was no way}} to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> enemy's signal was originally broadcast. This meant that the homing device could only be used for the initial tracking, and the final approach would have to be carried out by radar. The extra range of the Mk. VIII was not required in this role as Serrate would bring the fighter within easy tracking range, and the loss of a Mk. IV would not reveal the secret of the magnetron to the Germans. For this reason, the Mk. IV was considered superior to the newer radars for this role, in spite of any technical advantages of the newer designs.|$|E
5|$|Most of the ranged {{weapons are}} based on real {{firearms}} {{with the exception of}} a Yithian directed-energy weapon introduced at the end of the game. The player character can also perform a melee attack with a crowbar or with a gun if all ammunition for it has been used up. The game features a realistic combat system: due to lack of HUD, the player has to count shots manually to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> gun goes empty. There is also no artificial on-screen targeting reticle; instead, the player must aim through the iron sights on the weapons themselves, but sustained aiming tires the character and drops accuracy. The shooting system is unique in that fired rounds go exactly where the gun's barrel is pointing. For example, if the player character readies a reloaded weapon and the player pulls the trigger before the character animation has finished, the round will be discharged in the direction the gun was pointing when the shot was fired.|$|E

25|$|Air Service squadrons flew {{along the}} border searching for bands of men and {{reported}} to the nearest cavalry post how many men they were, where they were, which way they were heading, what they were doing, and how many horses and cattle they had. The timing of the patrols varied so raiders would not <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> next plane would appear.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} the {{instrument}} was to standardise the measurement {{of time and the}} calendar. The convention in Sicily had been that the (24‑hour) day was measured from the moment of dawn, which of course meant that no two locations had the same time and, more importantly, did not have the same time as in St. Peter's Basilica in Rome. It was also important to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> vernal equinox occurred, to provide the correct date for Easter.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, {{the canteen}} {{continued}} to operate as men were returning home. Eventually it closed on April 1, 1946 having served over six million servicemen and women. Sixteen trains were scheduled on the final day and regular Monday workers were in charge along with Lutheran Church women from North Platte, and Gothenburg, Nebraska. They would work from five in the morning until midnight, as they wouldn't <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> troop trains would come through as it was secret. Food was also donated during a time of rationing so that the soldiers could experience a taste of home of sorts.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1944 the Soviet Red Army {{advanced}} {{to the outskirts of}} Vilnius. This change in the tides of war brought both joy and fear to the surviving Jews of the HKP camp who understood that the SS would try to kill them {{in the days before the}} German retreat. Many prepared for this eventuality by discreetly making hiding places in the camp in secret bunkers, in walls, and in the rafters of the attic. A large and crucial unknown was one of timing — the prisoners needed to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> SS killing squads were coming so they could successfully implement plans to escape or hide. As the sounds of fighting grew closer the level of tension within the camp became palpable.|$|E
25|$|At the Allahabad {{session of}} the Indian National Congress in 1888, Narayan Vishnu, a {{delegate}} from Poona vehemently opposed the Indian Salt Act. A resolution was passed wherein the delegates present declared 'That this Congress do put on record its disapproval of the recent enhancement of the salt tax as involving a perceptible increase to {{the burden of the}} poorer classes, as also the 'partial adoption, in a time of peace and plenty, of the only financial reserve of the Empire.' The 1892 session at Allahabad concluded thus: '...We do not <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> tax will be reduced. So that there is every necessity for our repeating this prayer {{in the interests of the}} masses, and we earnestly hope that it will he granted before long'. A similar sort of protest was also issued at the Congress session at Ahmedabad.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, at {{the time}} that the {{operation}} was planned there was no way for the Australian commanders to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> war would come to an end and there were political and operational reasons to carry out the campaign. By late 1944, the Australian Army had taken a secondary role in the fighting and there was a political need for Australia to demonstrate that it was sharing the burden in the Pacific. As New Guinea was an Australian territory {{at the time}}, it was argued that there was a responsibility to clear the Japanese from that area; however, due to manpower shortages in the Australian economy, the government had requested that the Army find a way to reduce its size, while at the same time requiring it to maintain forces to undertake further operations against the Japanese into 1946. In order to do that, it was argued that there was a requirement to clear the Japanese that had been bypassed in order to allow the garrisons of these areas to be reduced.|$|E
25|$|Kalas awakens in Mintaka, the Imperial capital, and {{receives}} both his Winglet and his guardian spirit back from Xelha. He also {{takes on the}} role of world-saving hero with greater enthusiasm than before, feeling he must make amends for deceiving his friends. After this, Mizuti directs the group to the lands below the Taintclouds, a poisonous layer of gas {{at the bottom of the}} sky. The atmosphere down there has become breathable over a thousand years, but this was not always the case. Due to this, the people who lived down there wore masks which could filter the air and make it possible to breathe. They also do not <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> air became safe to breathe. It is down here that the gang learn about the Sword of the Heavens, and that this area is Mizuti's homeland. Sadly, the Sword of the Heavens had been stolen by Krumly, who resented the role of guardians that the children of the Earth have inherited for generations. He therefore attempted a ritual to a pierce a hole in the Taintcoluds and beg Malpercio to release the children of the Earth from their duty. This turns out to be a mistake as Melodia and Malpercio rampage through Krumly's village. The village is saved by a last minute intervention from Kalas and the gang, but the Sword of the Heavens is broken.|$|E
500|$|Before {{the group}} could perform again, the show's {{producers}} learned about Ryu's visa status; {{he was in}} the United States legally, but he was ineligible to compete for the winning prize. Page and Varela found Panikkar in time for their next performance in Las Vegas, where they were sent directly to sing in front of the show's producers. Varela called it a stressful week, during which the new trio {{had to learn how to}} work together, and on a song Panikkar didn't <b>know.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> men faced the judges, Mel B asked them to explain the personnel change, and said it was like a second audition. After Forte sang [...] "The Prayer", Stern said to the other judges, [...] "the new guy is the strongest singer." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode's main storylines {{revolve around}} Peter Petrelli (Milo Ventimiglia) and Hiro Nakamura's (Masi Oka) quest {{to stop the}} release of the Shanti virus, and Sylar's (Zachary Quinto) attempt to regain his powers. The end of the episode {{features}} a brief prologue of the third volume, [...] "Villains", which features Sylar regaining his powers. Originally, the virus was going to be released, and Tim Kring said that it was to play a big role in Volume 3. Kring stated that the ending had to be rewritten because they did not <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> show would return to air, and they {{wanted to make sure that}} they tied up all the loose ends. [...] "Powerless" [...] was watched by eleven million Americans and received mainly positive reviews from critics, with many saying that it was a positive end to a lackluster season.|$|E
500|$|During the 1930s, American studios {{were looking}} for fresh European talent. Ironically, Wong caught their eye and she was offered a {{contract}} with Paramount Studios in 1930. Enticed {{by the promise of}} lead roles and top billing, she returned to the United States. [...] The prestige and training she had gained during her years in Europe led to a starring role on Broadway in On the Spot, a drama that ran for 167performances and which she would later film as Dangerous to <b>Know.</b> <b>When</b> <b>the</b> play's director wanted Wong to use stereotypical Japanese mannerisms, derived from Madame Butterfly, in her performance of a Chinese character, Wong refused. She instead used her knowledge of Chinese style and gestures to imbue the character with a greater degree of authenticity. Following her return to Hollywood in 1930, Wong repeatedly turned to the stage and cabaret for a creative outlet.|$|E
500|$|The {{exterior}} {{model was}} created in CGI {{rather than as a}} physical model, with the production done by Pierre Drolet from Foundation Imaging using LightWave 3D. Two versions were created – a high definition version that was created for use in the television series itself and a lower resolution, which was also referred to as the [...] "approved model". The low-res model was used for promotional purposes while work was conducted on the television model. The exterior of the ship made its debut in a centerfold spread in the July 14, 2001 edition of TV Guide using the approved model. This version looked smaller as the windows on the ship were larger than used on the television version, and the hull had a bronze tint. Regarding this change in coloration, Drexler later said that he didn't <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> change was made as both he and Zimmerman approved the prior version.|$|E

500|$|Shortly {{after leaving}} the organization, Christman began protesting in Florida against Scientology {{with members of the}} Lisa McPherson Trust. She picketed with signs outside of the organization's Fort Harrison Hotel in Clearwater, Florida. Scientology representatives in Clearwater complained to police in November 2000 about the picketing, and Christman and Minton were fined US$100. On February 21, 2001, Judge Thomas E. Penick {{dismissed}} other charges in the case, and criticized Scientology for its treatment of critics, commenting, [...] "I'm missing the point here. I hope someone will let us <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> great invasion is coming." [...] This experience was a defining period for Christman, as she was concerned that her former church would attempt to characterize her as a criminal. She maintained that the actions by representatives of Scientology against her were examples of the policy, [...] "Fair Game"; a form of retribution for criticizing the organization.|$|E
500|$|As part of Gatekeeper's {{marketing}} campaign, Cedar Point released several teasers {{on their}} [...] "OnPoint" [...] blog.

[...] Burnet made a hardnosed attempt to force the Massachusetts assembly to grant him a permanent salary. [...] Since the institution of the royal charter in 1692, the assembly had steadfastly resisted this, choosing instead to make periodic grants to the governor. [...] Local politicians found this an effective mechanism for influencing the governor to approve their policies, since the governor would never <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> next grant would be made, or how large it would be. [...] The salary matter was one of many that had vexed Governor Shute during his time in the province.
