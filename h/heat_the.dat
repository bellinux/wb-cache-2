5|$|It {{is thought}} that the energy {{necessary}} to <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> corona is provided by turbulent motion in the convection zone below the photosphere, and two main mechanisms have been proposed to explain coronal heating. The first is wave heating, in which sound, gravitational or magnetohydrodynamic waves are produced by turbulence in the convection zone. These waves travel upward and dissipate in the corona, depositing their energy in the ambient matter {{in the form of}} <b>heat.</b> <b>The</b> other is magnetic heating, in which magnetic energy is continuously built up by photospheric motion and released through magnetic reconnection in the form of large solar flares and myriad similar but smaller events—nanoflares.|$|E

There was back and forth action between the two teams, as all of the superstars were able to participate in the match. After a Snapshot to Haas, Mercury pinned Haas, which resulted in MNM retaining the WWE Tag Team title.|$|E
5|$|After Sunday Night <b>Heat,</b> <b>the</b> {{pay-per-view}} event {{began with}} a tag team match for the World Tag Team Championship. The champions, La Résistance (René Duprée and Sylvain Grenier), defended their titles against The Dudley Boyz (Bubba Ray and D-Von). Throughout the match, both teams performed many offensive maneuvers, though The Dudley Boyz were able to gain the upper hand when they executed a 3D on Duprée. As D-Von covered Duprée, Rob Conway, who was disguised as a cameraman, hit D-Von with a camera while the referee was distracted. Duprée then covered D-Von for a successful pinfall to retain the championship.|$|E
5|$|After welding, {{a number}} of {{distinct}} regions can be identified in the weld area. The weld itself is called the fusion zone—more specifically, it is where the filler metal was laid during the welding process. The properties of the fusion zone depend primarily on the filler metal used, and its compatibility with the base materials. It is surrounded by the heat-affected zone, the area that had its microstructure and properties altered by the weld. These properties depend on the base material's behavior when subjected to <b>heat.</b> <b>The</b> metal {{in this area is}} often weaker than both the base material and the fusion zone, and is also where residual stresses are found.|$|E
50|$|It is also {{possible}} to run a heat driven operation combined with a <b>heat</b> pump, where <b>the</b> excess electricity (as <b>heat</b> demand is <b>the</b> defining factor on utilization) is used to drive a heat pump.

30|$|From {{what has}} been {{analyzed}} above, the length of wellbore section, whose temperature above the inflection point temperature, was determined by <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> length and <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> power. <b>The</b> <b>heating</b> length determined <b>the</b> start point of heating; <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> power determined how long the wellbore temperature remained above the inflection point temperature.|$|R
5|$|All {{the above}} Raman modes can be {{observed}} both as Stokes and anti-Stokes scattering. As mentioned above, Raman scattering from CNTs is resonant in nature, i.e. only tubes whose band gap energy {{is similar to the}} laser energy are excited. The difference between those two energies, and thus the band gap of individual tubes, can be estimated from the intensity ratio of the Stokes/anti-Stokes lines. This estimate however relies on the temperature factor (Boltzmann factor), which is often miscalculated – a focused laser beam is used in the measurement, which can locally <b>heat</b> <b>the</b> nanotubes without changing the overall temperature of the studied sample.|$|E
5|$|An {{exploding}} cigar is {{a variety}} of cigar that explodes shortly after being lit.

Nevertheless, the high risk of unintended injuries from their use caused a decline in their manufacture and sale.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{conservation}} of angular momentum, the nebula spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the nebula condensed, the atoms within it began to collide with increasing frequency, converting their kinetic energy into <b>heat.</b> <b>The</b> centre, {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. Over about 100,000 years, the competing forces of gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation caused the contracting nebula to flatten into a spinning protoplanetary disc with a diameter of about 200AU and form a hot, dense protostar (a star in which hydrogen fusion has not yet begun) at the centre.|$|E

30|$|In principle, {{whenever}} <b>the</b> <b>heating</b> state changes, <b>the</b> DEWH {{will either}} start or stop preheating.
