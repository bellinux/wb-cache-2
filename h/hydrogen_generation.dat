While generating hydrogen at centralized primary energy plants promises higher hydrogen production efficiency, difficulties in high-volume, long range hydrogen transportation (due to factors such as [...] hydrogen damage and the ease of hydrogen diffusion through solid materials) makes electrical energy distribution attractive within a hydrogen economy. In such a scenario, small regional plants or even local filling stations could generate hydrogen using energy provided through the electrical distribution grid.

Here, {{we show that}} high frequency field stimulation of primary hippocampal neurons generated Ca 2 + signals with an early and a late component, and promoted <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide <b>generation</b> via a neuronal NADPH oxidase. <b>Hydrogen</b> peroxide <b>generation</b> required both Ca 2 + entry through N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and Ca 2 + release mediated by ryanodine receptors (RyR). Field stimulation also enhanced nuclear translocation of the NF-kB p 65 protein and NF-kB -dependent transcription, and increased c-fos mRNA and type- 2 RyR protein content. Preincubation with inhibitory ryanodine or with the antioxidant N-acetyl L-cysteine abolished the increase in <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide <b>generation</b> and the late Ca 2 + signal component induced by electrical stimulation. Primary cortical cells behaved similarly as primary hippocampal cells. Exogenous hydrogen peroxide also activated NF-kB-dependent transcription in hippocampal neurons; inhibitory ryanodine prevented this effect. Selective inhibition of the NADPH oxidase or N-acetyl L-cysteine also prevented the enhanced translocation of p 65 in hippocampal cells, while N-acetyl L-cysteine abolished the increase in RyR 2 protein content induced by high frequency stimulation. In conclusion, the present results show that electrical stimulation induced reciprocal activation of ryanodine receptor-mediated Ca 2 + signals and <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide <b>generation,</b> which stimulated jointly NF-kB activity...|$|R

Conducting electroactive polymers, such as polypyrrole and polythiophenes, containing specific groups represent {{a new class of}} electroactive semiconducting materials with great potential application in a number of areas, including <b>hydrogen</b> gas <b>generation</b> and photovoltaic devices. A range of novel conducting electroactive polymers have been synthesized and characterized in this work. A new electrolytic cell system for <b>hydrogen</b> gas <b>generation</b> and a new solar cell system for photovoltaic (energy conversion from sunlight to electricity) applications have been devised. Conducting electroactive polymers, polypyrrole and polythiophene, containing pendant group ferrocene or ferrocenophane have been electrochemically synthesized for <b>hydrogen</b> gas <b>generation.</b> Electrochemically controlled <b>hydrogen</b> production has been carried out with these new ferrocene or ferrocenophane containing polymer-modified platinum electrodes. Results show that these coatings catalyze <b>hydrogen</b> gas <b>generation,</b> which is associated with the presence of the ferrocene or ferrocenophane moiety in the conducting electroactive polymers. A significant and substantial anodic shift occurs in the potential for formation of hydrogen gas when using these polymer-modified platinum electrodes. In addition, the basicity of the ferrocene moiety and the porosity and the morphology of the conducting polymer have been shown to play significant roles in the rate of potentiostatic <b>hydrogen</b> gas <b>generation.</b> Photovoltaic devices have also been fabricated by using novel conducting electroactive polymers electrosynthesised from bis-linked terthiophene and porphyrin substituted bisterthiophene as light harvesters. The electropolymerisation conditions for these polymers have been investigated and optimised to produce the best photovoltaic device. In addition, the use of different liquid electrolytes, such as ionic liquids, has been examined in this work. As compared to the devices described by other research groups, significant improvement of photovoltaic responses for open circuit voltage (Voc) and short circuit current (Isc) has been observed using these new types of solar cells.

Based on recent reports that reactive oxygen metabolites {{may play a role}} in endotoxin-induced injury in other tissues, we postulated that reactive oxygen metabolites may be important mediators of endotoxin-induced {{acute renal failure}}. Superoxide dismutase, a scavenger of superoxide, or catalase, which destroys hydrogen peroxide, did not protect against endotoxin-induced renal failure. Similarly, neither the hydroxyl radical scavenger dimethylthiourea nor the iron chelator deferoxamine (which presumably would act by preventing the generation of hydroxyl radical via the iron-catalyzed Haber-Weiss reaction) prevented the endotoxin-induced fall in renal function. In separate experiments, we found no increase in renal cortical lipid peroxidation (a marker of reactive oxygen metabolite-mediated tissue injury) in endo-toxin-treated rats, providing further evidence against a role for reactive oxygen metabolites in endotoxin-induced renal injury. Finally, using the aminotriazole-induced inhibition of catalase (a measure of in vivo changes in the <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide <b>generation)</b> we found no evidence of enhanced <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide <b>generation</b> in the renal cortex in endotox-in-treated rats.
