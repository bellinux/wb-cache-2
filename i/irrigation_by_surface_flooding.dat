Four stress levels due to excessive wetness, equivalent to 90, 180, 270 and 360 cm-days (Sieben 2 ̆ 7 s SEW[subscript] 30 concept), were applied to growing corn <b>by</b> <b>surface</b> <b>flooding</b> for 3, 6, 9, and 12 days, and for 6, 12, 18, and 24 days when the water table was maintained at 15 cm below the soil surface;Results of this study indicated that the SEW[subscript] 30 concept is not the best indicator of the relationship of soil wetness to crop response. Models were developed to predict shoot dry matter and yield as a function of SEW[subscript] 30 values for each level of flooding. All growth parameters (plant height, leaf area, shoot dry matter and grain yield) were significantly related to the position of water table, either <b>surface</b> <b>flooding</b> or 15 cm below the surface;Surface flooding of corn reduced root dry weight significantly with the duration of flooding, a relation that did not hold for water table at 15 cm below the soil surface.

40|$|Recirculating {{irrigation}} {{runoff water}} is a method of making more effec-tive use of irrigation water. Reuse of runoff water decreases {{the amount of water}} that needs to be pumped or delivered and can be used to improve water application efficiency. It also reduces the possibility of pollution of natural streams from irrigated land. Other benefits are reduced surface drainage costs, improved weed control and the saving of irrigation labor. Reuse systems are readily adapted to automation and can be used advantageously in modern Labor-saving, automated and semi-automated irrigation systems. The economic value of runoff water will usually be the deciding factor in installing a recirculating irrigation system. However, in some areas run-off may be prohibited by law and recirculation is then mandatory. Where water is relatively expensive, such as water pumped from wells or where the supply is limited, reuse of runoff water may result in a more economical irrigation operation. Reuse of irrigation runoff water may be more economical than the use of additional labor to accomplish efficient <b>irrigation</b> <b>by</b> <b>surface</b> methods. Where runoff water is recycled, most of the diverted or pumped irrigation water will infiltrate the soil. A reuse system enables the irrigator to use the maximum allowable stream flow in each furrow.

40|$|Shallow {{groundwater}} is {{an important}} source of water for the maintenance and restoration of ecosystems in arid environments, which necessitates a deeper understanding of its complex spatial and temporal dynamics driven by hydrological processes. This study explores the dominant hydrological processes that control the shallow groundwater dynamics in the Gobi Desert-riparian-oasis system of the lower Heihe River, a typical arid inland river basin located in northwestern China. The groundwater level and temperature were monitored in 14 shallow wells at 30 -min intervals during the 2010 - 2012 period. After combining this information with meteorological and hydrological data, a comprehensive analysis was conducted to understand the dynamic behaviour of the shallow groundwater system and to determine the dominant factors that control the groundwater flow processes. The results of the study indicate notably large temporal and spatial variations in both the groundwater level and temperature. Noticeable fluctuations in the groundwater level (0. 5 - 1 m) and temperature (4 - 8 C) were observed in the riparian zone, evidencing a clear river influence. In comparison, the groundwater fluctuations in the Gobi Desert were more stable (the annual variations of the water table were less than 0. 5 m, and the water temperature varied by no more than 2 C). Strong variations in the groundwater table (1. 5 - 5. 0 m/year) and temperature (1. 5 - 6. 5 C), mainly caused <b>by</b> <b>surface</b> <b>flood</b> <b>irrigation</b> and groundwater pumping, were observed in the oasis area. The investigated sites were categorized into three types that reflect the dominant hydrological processes: (1) the riparian zone, dominated by riverbank filtration and groundwater evapotranspiration; (2) the Gobi Desert area, controlled by groundwater evaporation and lateral recharge; and (3) the oasis area, dominated by groundwater evapotranspiration as well as surface-groundwater interactions caused by human activities. 2012 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Following {{extensive}} <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> (SWF) in England {{in summer}} 2007, {{progress has been}} made in improving the management and prediction of this type of flooding. A rainfall threshold-based extreme rainfall alert (ERA) service was launched in 2009 and superseded in 2011 <b>by</b> the <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> risk assessment (SWFRA). Through survey responses from local authorities (LAs) and the outcome of workshops with a range of flood professionals, this paper examines the understanding, benefits, limitations and ways to improve the current SWF warning service. The current SWFRA alerts are perceived as useful by district and county LAs, although their understanding of them is limited. The majority of LAs take action upon receipt of SWFRA alerts, and their reactiveness to alerts appears to have increased over the years and as SWFRA superseded ERA. This is a positive development towards increased resilience to SWF. The main drawback of the current service is its broad spatial resolution. Alternatives for providing localised SWF forecast and warnings were analysed, and a two-tier national-local approach, with pre-simulated scenario-based local SWF forecasting and warning systems, was deemed most appropriate by flood professionals given current monetary, human and technological resources. status: accepte...|$|R

Following the extensive <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> experienced in summer 2007 a rainfall threshold-based Extreme Rainfall Alert (ERA) was piloted by the Met Office and Environment Agency providing initial steps towards the establishment of a warning for some types of <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding.</b> The findings of this paper are based primarily on feedback on technical options from a range of professionals involved in flood forecasting and warning and flood risk management, about the current alerts and about the potential options for developing a more targeted <b>surface</b> water <b>flood</b> warning service. Providing <b>surface</b> water <b>flooding</b> warnings presents a set of technical, forecasting and warning challenges related to the rapid onset of flooding, the localised nature of the flooding, and the linking of rainfall and flood forecasts to flood likelihood and impact on the ground.

40|$|The Palaeogene Promina Beds (PB), {{exposed in}} the Dinaric coastal range, {{is about a}} 2 km thick {{heterogeneous}} succession representing a late sedimentary fill of the North Dalmatian foreland basin. The paper  focuses on the middle part of the PB represented by a prominent transgressive unit. The study of this unit is based on field mapping, logging and facies analysis, {{as well as the}} investigation of stratigraphic surfaces and facies successions. The unit extends for more than 63 km, along the entire basin. Deposition began transgressively over both alluvial deposits of the Lower PB and older basin basement. Along its extent the studied unit may be represented either by stacked (high-frequency), marine transgressive-regressive cycles, by lacustrine deposits, mainly limestones, or by a single, marine limestone unit. An ideal transgressive-regressive cycle includes a transgressive segment of limestones, and a regressive segment of storm-wave dominated shelf to gravelly beachface (coarsening-upward) deposits. Gravelly beaches are represented by several types. One of them included the steeply inclined, lower beachface which is situated below the intertidal zone. The cycles are separated <b>by</b> lower-rank discontinuity <b>surfaces</b> (<b>flooding</b> <b>surfaces),</b> while their two segments are separated by a lower-rank transgressive-regressive turnaround surface. Lacustrine deposits originated due to a rise in groundwater induced by a sea-level rise basinwards. The deposition of a single limestone unit resulted from a transgressive onlap over uplifted, Eocene and Cretaceous carbonates of the basin basement. The end of the transgression is marked by condensation processes indicated by glauconite, skeletal debris, planktonic foraminifera and hardgrounds, and a major transgressive-regressive turnaround. The subsequent evolution is almost uniform along the entire extent of the studied unit, and includes shelf to delta and shelf to beach cycles of the highstand.

40|$|Mars was {{characterized}} <b>by</b> cataclysmic groundwater-sourced <b>surface</b> <b>flooding</b> that formed large outflow channels {{and that may}} have altered the climate for extensive periods during the Hesperian era. In particular, it has been speculated that such events could have induced significant rainfall and caused the formation of late-stage valley networks. We present the results of 3 -D Global Climate Model simulations reproducing the {{short and long term}} climatic impact {{of a wide range of}} outflow channel formation events under cold ancient Mars conditions. We find that the most intense of these events (volumes of water up to 10 ^ 7 km^ 3 and released at temperatures up to 320 Kelvins) cannot trigger long-term greenhouse global warming, regardless of how favorable are the external conditions (e. g. obliquity and seasons). In any case, outflow channel formation events at any atmospheric pressure are unable to produce rainfall or significant snowmelt at latitudes below 40 ^∘N. On the long term, for an obliquity of ∼ 45 ^∘ and atmospheric pressures > 80 mbar, we find that the lake ice (formed quickly after the outflow event) is transported progressively southward through the mechanisms of sublimation and adiabatic cooling. At the same time, and as long as the initial water reservoir is not entirely sublimated, ice deposits remain in the West Echus Chasma Plateau region where hints of hydrological activity contemporaneous with outflow channel formation events have been observed. However, because the high albedo of ice drives Mars to even colder temperatures, snowmelt produced by seasonal solar forcing is difficult to attain.
