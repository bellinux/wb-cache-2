40|$|The primary {{object of}} the present {{invention}} {{is to provide a}} simple, reliable, and lightweight coupling that will also have an efficient thermal interface. A further {{object of the}} invention is to provide a coupling that is capable of blind mating with little or no insertion forces. Another object of the invention is to provide a coupling that acts as a thermal regulator to maintain a constant temperature {{on one side of the}} coupling. Another object of the invention is to increase the available surface area of a coupling thus providing a larger area for the conduction of heat across the thermal interface. Another object of the invention is to provide a fluidic coupling that has no fluid passing across the interface, thus reducing the likelihood of leaks and contamination. The foregoing objects are achieved by utilizing, as in the prior art, a hot area (at an elevated temperature as compared to a cold area) with a need to remove excess heat from the hot area to a cold area. In this device, the thermal interface will occur not on a planar horizontal surface, but along a non-planar vertical surface, which will reduce the reaction forces and increase the thermal conductivity of the device. One non-planar surface is a surface on a cold pin extending from the cold area and the other non-planar surface is a surface on a <b>hot</b> <b>pin</b> extending from the hot area. The cold pin is fixed and does not move while the <b>hot</b> <b>pin</b> is a flexible member and its movement towards the cold pin will bring the two non-planar surfaces together forming the thermal interface.

By properly programming the actuation wire, heat from the hot area will cause the actuation wire to bend the hot wire.

40|$|A {{sensitivity}} {{study has}} been performed on the Unprotected Loss-Of-Flow accident for a 400 MWth lead-cooled accelerator-driven system. The investigated design data parameters were the core pitch-to-diameter ratio, the core height, and the distance between thermal centres. The examined physical properties were the coolant’s conductivity, the fuel’s conductivity, the pump halving time and the heat transfer coefficient at the <b>hottest</b> fuel <b>pin.</b> The <b>hottest</b> inner clad temperature has been the reference output variable. The target {{of the study is}} to identify the input parameters that produce a stronger impact on the reference output variable. The statistical strategy followed in this {{study has been}} a two level fractional factorial design. Each factor (either design datum or physical property) is considered to take only two possible values, lower and upper, which are respectively the lower and upper values of the corresponding ranges. Since all possible combinations of the seven factors aren’t affordable from a computational point of view, a ‘wise’ selection of computer runs is done in a stepwise procedure. This procedure allows to discard non-relevant parameters at early stages and to pay attention to actually important factors. Within the ranges and uncertainties considered, three design parameters were identified as the most influential parameters, the core pitch-to-diameter ratio being the most influential one by far. A slightly non-linear influence of this design parameter on the hottest inner clad temperature was uncovered by running the code at a central design point. JRC. F. 4 -Nuclear design safet...|$|R
40|$|Fuel {{performance}} {{models have}} been developed to assess the performance of ThO[subscript 2]-UO[subscript 2] fuels that can be operated to a high burnup up to 80 - 100 MWd/kgHM in current and future Light Water Reactors (LWRs). Among the various issues raised in high burnup fuel applications, the pellet rim effect, fission gas release (FGR), and response to reactivity initiated accidents (RIA) were of special interest in this work. These phenomena were modeled by modifying the NRC licensing codes FRAPCON- 3 for normal operation and FRAP-T 6 for transient conditions. These models were verified and compared to the results of previous thorium fuel studies and high burnup uranium fuel evaluations. The buildup of plutonium in the outer rim of LWR UO[subscript 2] pellets has been observed to create a region of high fuel burnup, fission gas buildup and high porosity at the fuel rim. The power distribution of the thoria and urania fuel was calculated using a neutronics code MOCUP. Due to the lower build-up of Pu- 239 (less U- 238 in ThO[subscript 2]-UO[subscript 2] fuel) and flatter distribution of U- 233 (less resonance capture in Th- 232), thoria fuel experiences a much flatter power distribution and thus has a less severe rim effect than UO[subscript 2] fuel. To model this effect properly, a new model, THUPS (Thoria-Urania Power Shape), was developed, benchmarked with MOCUP and adapted into FRAPCON- 3. Additionally a porosity model for the rim region was introduced at high burnup to account for the larger fuel swelling and degradation of the thermal conductivity. The mechanisms of fission gas release in ThO[subscript 2]-UO[subscript 2] fuel have been found similar to those of UO[subscript 2] fuel. Therefore, the general formulations of the existing fission gas release models in FRAPCON- 3 were retained. However, the gas diffusion coefficient in thoria was adjusted to a lower level to account for the smaller observed gas release fraction in the thoria-based fuel. To model accelerated fission gas release at high burnup properly, a new athermal fission gas release model was developed. Other modifications include the thoria fuel properties, fission gas production rate, and the corrosion model to treat advanced cladding materials. The modified version of FRAPCON- 3 was calibrated using the measured fission gas release data from the Light Water Breeder Reactor (LWBR) program. Using the new model to calculate the gas release in typical PWR <b>hot</b> <b>pins</b> gives data that indicate that the ThO[subscript 2]-UO[subscript 2] fuel will have considerably lower fission gas release beyond a burnup of 50 MWd/kgHM. Investigation of the fuel response to an RIA included: (1) reviewing industry simulation tests to understand the mechanisms involved, (2) modifying FRAP-T 6 code to simulate the RIA tests and investigate the key contributors to fuel failure (thermal expansion, gaseous swelling, cladding burst stress), and (3) assessing thoria and urania performance during RIA event in typical LWR situations. ThO[subscript 2]-UO[subscript 2] fuel has been found to have better performance than UO[subscript 2] fuel under RIA event conditions due to its lower thermal expansion and a flatter power distribution in the fuel pellet (less power and less fission gas in the rim region). Overall, thoria has been found to have better performance than urania in both normal and off-normal conditions. However, calculations using the modified FRAPCON- 3 showed that the internal pressure and cladding corrosion at the required high burnup of 80 - 100 MWd/kgHM are not acceptable with the current fuel design. Therefore, advanced fuel designs (including larger gas plenum, larger fuel grains, advanced cladding materials), and carefully designed operating strategy (i. e. decreasing power history) were assessed and the results showed that the targeted high burnup can be achieved. Further investigation of burnup issues is needed, such as the distribution of hydrogen in the cladding for heterogeneous fuels, and response of high pressure fuel pins to a loss of coolant accident, in order to assure satisfactory high burnup behavior.

40|$|This work {{is based}} on the European Collaborative Project on the European Sodium Fast Reactor (CP-ESFR). CP-ESFR was {{initiated}} as part of the EURATOM contribution to the GIF and as an attempt to create a common European framework to support the sodium fast reactor technology. It was launched within the 7 th EURATOM Framework programme and 24 European partners are assigned the objective to establish the technical basis of a European sodium fast reactor plant with improved safety performance, resource efficiency and cost efficacy. The design and safety analysis of current and future nuclear reactors, during normal operation and under accidental condition, requires continuous improvement of computational accuracies. To this purpose, multi-physics approaches including detailed, coupled neutronic and thermal hydraulic assessments are being increasingly developed and used. In this work, a further step in the neutronic analysis of the European Sodium Fast Reactor (ESFR) is attempted. This thesis work was developed with the collaboration of the Joint Research Centre – Institute for Energy and Transport (JRC – IET) and it was a follow up of previous studies. In particular this study is focused on the research of the power peaking fuel pin at end of cycle (EoC) after the insertion of a specific value of reactivity. The Monte Carlo code MCNP 6 has been used for all the calculations here presented. This code differs from its predecessors being the first which integrates all the features of MCNP 5 and MCNPX providing, therefore, the capability to perform burn up calculation with the depletion code CINDER 90. The MCNP 6 input file of the reactor, developed at JRC – IET, represents the whole core at the beginning of life (BoL) condition and as such it could not be directly used to achieve the aforementioned goal of this study. Thus, it has been necessary to work on it in order to search, first, for the position of the control rods corresponding to the critical reactor (the original input file was not representing such a reactor state), hence, by using the new burnup card, to get the material composition of the fuel at the EoC, the breeding ratio and some other safety parameters before to start the fuel assembly and fuel pin analysis to identify the power peaking fuel pin. The insertion of reactivity was done in three different ways: 1. Partial withdrawn of all the control rods. 2. Complete extraction of a selected control rod. 3. Complete extraction of two selected control rods. This choice was done to make a comparison between a global insertion of reactivity and a local insertion of reactivity.

40|$|One way to {{increase}} {{the power of a}} nuclear reactor is to change the solid cylindrical fuel to Internally and Externally Cooled (I&EC) annular fuel, and adjust the flow and the core inlet coolant temperature. The switch to annular fuel allows for a 20 % increase in core power density without changing the assembly size or the control rod placement. Such an approach is being considered for the Korean reactor OPR 1400. The analysis of I&EC fuel with a modified version of FRAPCON- 3. 3 revealed that an uneven heat flux split between the outer and inner surfaces may develop which does not yield an optimal design. After optimization, it is found that excessive cladding oxidation on the inner channel of the <b>hottest</b> fuel <b>pin</b> may occur due to excessive internal heat flux, which is controlled by the gap conductance. As the gaps close asymmetrically, the MDNBR limit of 1. 3 could also be violated. At the uprated power, control of the gap sizes is needed in order to satisfy the thermal-hydraulic requirements. One solution is {{to increase}} the flow rate to increase the MDNBR and to reduce the coolant temperature to decrease the cladding oxidation. Reduced-moderation Water Reactor (RMWR) is a boiling water reactor proposed to operate with mixed oxide fuel and, a harder neutron spectrum and higher local fuel burnup compared to the traditional Light Water Reactors. The fissile content of the fuel is concentrated in two pancake like regions in the core separated by a blanket (fertile-only) region. (cont.) The FRAPCON fuel performance code has been modified to assess the behavior of the RMWR fuel pins. Properties were modified to allow for a higher concentration of plutonium oxide. A new mechanistic model was adopted to simulate the fission gas release and swelling behavior of the fuel. The gas bubble swelling at the grain edges and grain faces were modeled separately. In addition, solid fission product swelling model was modified and the effect of axial migration of the volatile fission product behavior on fuel performance was also analyzed. Specifically, the cesium migrates axially based on the evaporation/condensation mechanism. Cesium precipitation at the fuel blanket interface and the resulting excessive swelling of the fuel pin at these locations could potentially be a major source of local stresses. Furthermore, as-fabricated porosity migration, central void formation, and hot-pressing of the fuel pellet were also modeled. Finally, axial variation of the material properties was allowed to represent the active fuel region and the blanket regions. The updated version of FRAPCON (called FRAPCON-EP) was checked against experiments then used to analyze the RMWR fuel behavior to optimize various parameters such the fuel pellet smear density, plenum height, and achievable peak burnup in order to achieve performance that could satisfy the NRC requirements for fuel pins. by Andrew Lerch.

40|$|The ACR- 700 is an {{advanced}} pressure-tube (PT) reactor {{being developed by}} Atomic Energy of Canada Limited (AECL). As in conventional CANDU reactors, the PTs are horizontal. Each PT {{is surrounded by a}} calandria tube (CT), and the gap in between is filled with carbon dioxide gas. The space between the CTs is filled with the heavy-water moderator. One postulated accident scenario for ACR- 700 is the complete coolant flow blockage of a single PT. The flow is not monitored within each individual PT, thus during the early stages of this accident the reactor remains at full power and full pressure, resulting in rapid coolant boil-off and fuel overheating. Melting of the Zircaloy (Zry) components of the fuel bundle (cladding, end plates and end caps) can occur, with relocation of some molten material {{to the bottom of the}} PT. The hot spot caused by the molten Zry/PT interaction may cause PT/CT failure due to localized plastic strains. Failure of the PT/CT results in depressurization of the primary system, which triggers a reactor scram, after which the decay heat is removed via reflooding, thus PT/CT rupture effectively terminates the accident. Clearly, prediction of the time scale and conditions under which PT/CT failure occurs is of great importance for this accident. We analyzed the following key phenomena occurring after the blockage: (a) Coolant boil-off (b) Cladding heat-up and melting (c) Dripping of molten Zircaloy (Zry) from the fuel pin (d) Thermal interaction between the molten Zry and the PT (e) Localized bulging of the PT (f) Interaction of the bulged PT with the CT Simple one-dimensional models were adequate to describe (a), (b) and (c), while the three-dimensional nature of (d), (e) and (f) required the use of more sophisticated models including a finite-element description of the thermal transients within the PT and the CT, implemented with the code COSMOSM. (cont.) The main findings of the study are as follows: (1) Most coolant boils off within 3 s of accident initiation. (2) Depending on the magnitude of radiation heat transfer between adjacent fuel pins, the cladding of the <b>hot</b> fuel <b>pin</b> in the blocked PT reaches the melting point of Zry in 7 to 10 s after accident initiation. (3) Inception of melting of the UO 2 fuel pellets is not expected for at least another 7 s after 2 Zry melting. (4) Several effects could theoretically prevent molten Zry dripping from the fuel pins, including Zry/UO 2 interaction and Zry oxidation. However, it was concluded that because of the very high heat-up rate typical of the flow blockage accident sequence, holdup of molten Zry would not occur. Experimental verification of this conclusion is recommended. (5) Once the molten Zry relocates to the bottom of the PT, a hot spot is created that causes the PT to bulge out radially under the effect of the reactor pressure. The PT may come in contact with the CT, which heats up, bulges and eventually fails. (cont.) The inception and speed of the PT/CT bulging and ultimately the likelihood of failure depend strongly on the postulated mass of molten Zry in contact with the PT, and on the value of the thermal resistance at the Zry/PT interface. It was found that a Zry mass =/< 10 g will not cause PT/CT failure regardless of the contact resistance effect. On the other hand, a mass of 100 g would be sufficient to cause PT/CT failure even in the presence of a thick 0. 2 mm oxide layer at the interface. The characteristic time scales for this 100 -g case are as follows: PT bulging starts within 3 s of Zry/PT contact - PT makes contact with the CT in another 2 s - CT bulging starts in less than 1 s - CT failure occurs within another 5 s. Thus, the duration of the PT/CT deformation transient is 11 s, which gives a total duration of the accident (from PT blockage to PT/CT failure) of 18 to 21 s. by Craig Douglas Gerardi. Thesis (S. M.)
