40|$|Poor diet is a {{major public}} health concern. 1, 2 One policy that might help improve diet quality, which has been {{implemented}} in New York City and is being considered by other cities and states, requires chain restaurants to post <b>kilocalorie</b> (<b>calorie)</b> information on menus and menu boards. The aim of menu labels is to inform consumers about foods consumed outside the home, which account for approximately half of total food expenditures. 3 The rationale is that (1) food purchased outside the home is higher in calories, of poorer nutritional quality, and served in larger portions, which promotes overconsumption 4 – 7; (2) the frequency of fast food Draft: Draft: 33 rd rd Proof P oo...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE — We {{sought to}} {{determine}} differences between structured interviews, symptom questionnaires, and distress measures for assessment of depression in patients with diabetes. RESEARCHDESIGNANDMETHODS — We assessed 506 diabetic patients for major depressive disorder (MDD) by a structured interview (Composite International Diagnostic In-terview [CIDI]), a questionnaire for depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale [CESD]), and on the Diabetes Distress Scale. Demographic characteristics, two biological variables (A 1 C and non-HDL cholesterol), and four behavioral management measures (<b>kilocalories,</b> <b>calories</b> of saturated fat, number of fruit and vegetable servings, and minutes of physical activity) were assessed. Comparisons were made between those with and without depression on the CIDI and the CESD. RESULTS — Findings showed that 22 % of patients reached CESD 16, and 9. 9 % met a CIDI diagnosis of MDD. Of those above CESD cut points, 70 % were not clinically depressed, and 34 % {{of those who were}} clinically depressed did not reach CESD scores 16. Those scoring 16, compared with those 16 on the CESD, had higher A 1 C, <b>kilocalories,</b> and <b>calories</b> of saturated fat and lower physical activity. No differences were found using the CIDI. Diabetes distress wa...|$|R
50|$|Dietary fiber is a carbohydrate, {{specifically}} a polysaccharide, {{which is}} incompletely absorbed in humans {{and in some}} animals. Like all carbohydrates, when it is metabolized, it can produce four <b>Calories</b> (<b>kilocalories)</b> of energy per gram, but in most circumstances, it accounts for less than that because of its limited absorption and digestibility. The two subcategories are insoluble and soluble fiber. Insoluble dietary fiber consists mainly of cellulose, a large carbohydrate polymer that is indigestible by humans, because humans {{do not have the}} required enzymes to break it down, and the human digestive system does not harbor enough of the types of microbes that can do so. Soluble dietary fiber comprises a variety of oligosaccharides, waxes, esters, resistant starches, and other carbohydrates that dissolve or gelatinize in water. Many of these soluble fibers can be fermented or partially fermented by microbes in the human digestive system to produce short-chain fatty acids which are absorbed and therefore introduce some caloric content.|$|R

There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fibre. Whole grains, fruits (especially plums, prunes, and figs), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. Fiber is important to digestive health and is thought {{to reduce the risk of}} colon cancer. For mechanical reasons it can help in alleviating both constipation and diarrhea. Fiber provides bulk to the intestinal contents, and insoluble fiber especially stimulates peristalsis—the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines which move digesta along the digestive tract. Some soluble fibers produce a solution of high viscosity; this is essentially a gel, which slows the movement of food through the intestines. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, may help lessen insulin spikes and reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo compare {{changes in}} {{nutrient}} levels of school meals {{before and after}} implementation of nutrition interventions at five school districts in two, large U. S. counties. School menu changes were compared against national school meal recommendations. MethodsA large urban school district in Los Angeles County (LAC), California and four school districts in suburban Cook County (SCC), Illinois implemented school meal nutrition interventions. Nutrition analyses were conducted for school breakfast and lunch before and after changes {{were made to the}} meal programs. Means, % change, and net <b>calories</b> (<b>kilocalories</b> or kcal) offered {{as a result of the}} nutrition interventions were calculated. ResultsSchool districts in both counties made district-wide changes in their school breakfast and lunch menus. Menu changes resulted in a net reduction of calories, sugar, and sodium content offered in the meals. Net fewer calories offered as a result of the nutrition interventions were estimated to be about 64, 075 kcal per student per year for LAC and 22, 887 kcal per student per year for SCC. ConclusionsNutrition interventions can have broad reach through changes in menu offerings to school-aged children and adolescents. However, further research is needed to examine how these changes affect student food selection and consumption...|$|R
40|$|All foods contain energy, {{although}} {{the amount of}} potential energy stored will vary greatly {{depending on the type}} of food. When we eat food, our bodies convert the stored energy to chemical energy, allowing us to do work. The energy values of food are measured by the Calorie, with a capital C. A Calorie is equal to 1, 000 <b>calories</b> or 1 <b>kilocalorie</b> (kcal). A <b>calorie</b> is the amount of heat (energy) required to raise the temperature of 1 gram (g) of water 1 degree Celsius (°C). You can fi nd information about the amount of Calories in a food on the Nutrition Facts panel. For example, the Nutrition Facts panel below shows that this food contains 250 Calories. The label also shows how many grams of fat, carbohydrates, and protein it contains. These components contribute different amounts of Calories to the overall food product. Here is how many Calories are in a gram of each: 1 g fat = 9 Calories 1 g carbohydrate = 4 Calories 1 g protein = 4 Calories To determine the amount of Calories in a food, nutrition and food scientists can use an instrument that is called a calorimeter. A calorimeter (from the Latin word calor, meaning heat) is a device that measures the heat generated by a chemical reaction or change of state...|$|R

There are two subcategories: soluble and insoluble fiber. Whole grains, fruits (especially plums, prunes, and figs), and vegetables are good sources of dietary fiber. There are many health benefits of a high-fiber diet. Dietary fiber helps reduce the chance of gastrointestinal problems such as constipation and diarrhea by increasing the weight and size of stool and softening it. Insoluble fiber, found in whole wheat flour, nuts and vegetables, especially stimulates peristalsis;– the rhythmic muscular contractions of the intestines, which move digest along the digestive tract. Soluble fiber, found in oats, peas, beans, and many fruits, dissolves in water in the intestinal tract to produce a gel that slows the movement of food through the intestines. This may help lower blood glucose levels because it can slow the absorption of sugar. Additionally, fiber, perhaps especially that from whole grains, is thought to possibly help lessen insulin spikes, and therefore reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes. The link between increased fiber consumption and a decreased risk of colorectal cancer is still uncertain.|$|R
