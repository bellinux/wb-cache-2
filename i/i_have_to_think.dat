500|$|Bryan's announcement, after {{gaining the}} Democratic nomination, {{that he would}} {{undertake}} a nationwide tour by rail, something then unusual for presidential candidates, put pressure on McKinley to match him. Hanna especially urged his candidate to hit the road. McKinley decided against this, feeling {{that he could not}} outdo Bryan, who was a brilliant stump speaker, and that he would be foolish to try. [...] "I might as well put up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete against some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> when I speak." [...] Furthermore, no matter how McKinley traveled, Bryan would upstage him by choosing a less comfortable manner. McKinley was unwilling to compete with Bryan on the Democrat's terms, and sought to find his own way to reach the people.|$|E
500|$|Bryan's {{campaign}} had at most an estimated $500,000. With his eloquence and youthful energy his major {{assets in the}} race, Bryan decided on a whistle-stop political tour by train on an unprecedented scale. Hanna urged McKinley to match Bryan's tour {{with one of his}} own; the candidate declined {{on the grounds that the}} Democrat was a better stump speaker: [...] "I might just as well set up a trapeze on my front lawn and compete with some professional athlete as go out speaking against Bryan. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> when I speak." [...] Instead of going to the people, McKinley would remain at home in Canton and allow the people to come to him; according to historian R. Hal Williams in his book on the 1896 election, [...] "it was, as it turned out, a brilliant strategy. McKinley's 'Front Porch Campaign' became a legend in American political history." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hopper paid {{particular}} attention to geometrical design and the careful placement of human figures in proper balance with their environment. He was a slow and methodical artist; as he wrote, [...] "It {{takes a long time}} for an idea to strike. Then <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about it for a long time. I don't start painting until I have it all worked out in my mind. I'm all right when I get to the easel". He often made preparatory sketches to work out his carefully calculated compositions. He and his wife kept a detailed ledger of their works noting such items as [...] "sad face of woman unlit", [...] "electric light from ceiling", and [...] "thighs cooler".|$|E

2500|$|In November 2011, it was {{announced}} that Jackson would vacate the role due to the heavy amount of work he was receiving. TV Guide reported that Jackson attempted to negotiate with the network for a lighter schedule and to be repaired with on-screen love interest Herbst (Elizabeth), but was denied on both accounts. Jackson explained: [...] "I love to work hard but I've been at maximum capacity in terms of mental and emotional output for months on end and it has become too difficult. I am extremely thankful that they wanted to give me all those storylines with so much depth, but there's just no balance. (...) I have a wife and three kids and other things in life <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about. I just knew I couldn't sustain the schedule at GH and that kind of emotion for much longer. It was just too intense." [...] Jackson confirmed the character would not die or be recast, and last appeared the week of December 19, 2011.|$|E

6000|$|I {{turned away}} from them, put my foot on the fender, stuck my elbow on the plush-fringed mantelboard, and studied the photographs, pipes, and ash-trays that adorned it. What was it <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> out before <b>I</b> went to the station? ...|$|R
6000|$|The {{tenderness}} {{of woman}} let her hand glide over his cheek. She was {{not ashamed of}} her love. [...] "O Alan," [...] she cried, [...] "if it were only for myself, I could trust you with my life; I could trust you with anything. But I haven't only myself to think of. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of right and wrong; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the world; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of the cause which almost wholly hangs upon me. Not for nothing are these impulses implanted in my breast. They are {{the voice of the}} soul of all women within me. If I were to neglect them for the sake of gratifying your wishes,--if I were to turn traitor to my sex {{for the sake of the}} man I love, as so many women have turned before me, I should hate and despise myself. I couldn't love you, Alan, quite so much, loved I not honor more, and the battle imposed upon me." ...|$|E

5000|$|About Dog, Kamvar said [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> write code at a {{lower level}} of {{abstraction}} than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about the interactions.

2500|$|The role of Karen White was {{the other}} part cast early in the process. Actress Vicky McClure admitted, [...] "It was quite a {{difficult}} role to take on and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> quite carefully about it." [...] To help her get into character, McClure specifically asked that the hair designers give her artificial hair integrations.|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course it}} does. I {{ought to have}} known {{that it would be}} so with such a one as him. And then she is rich also--wonderfully rich! What right can <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of him?" ...|$|E

6000|$|Alton nodded. [...] "Yes," [...] he said. [...] "He had {{his grip}} {{right on the}} deerhide bag, as though he didn't want <b>to</b> let me <b>have</b> them, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of Mrs. Jimmy while I took them from him. It didn't seem quite fair of Jimmy, because they haven't much use for silver in the country the long trail leads to." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You know, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of a course. It was {{imperative}} {{that we should}} stay together a little while, to avoid the scandal to you that would have resulted from our immediate parting. But you must see it is only for form's sake." ...|$|E

5000|$|Milstein {{also studied}} with Eugène Ysaÿe in Belgium. He told {{film-maker}} Christopher Nupen, director of Nathan Milstein - In Portrait, {{that he learned}} almost nothing from Ysaÿe but enjoyed his company enormously. In a 1977 interview printed in High Fidelity, he said, [...] "I went to Ysaÿe in 1926 but he never paid any attention <b>to</b> me. I <b>think</b> {{it might have been}} better this way. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> for myself." ...|$|R
2500|$|When I {{first got}} picked for South Australia, Ian said, [...] "You {{got to decide}} what sort of a player {{you want to be}} – whether you want to be an aggressive, attacking player, or more like a {{grafting}} sort of player." [...] <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> about that and that I'm not really a free hitter of the ball, so the choice I made was I was going {{to be more of a}} grafter.|$|R
5000|$|In {{a letter}} to the {{psychologist}} Peter McKellar, Blyton describes her writing technique: I shut my eyes for a few minutes, with my portable typewriter on my knee - I make my mind a blank and wait - and then, as clearly as I would see real children, my characters stand before me in my mind's eye ...

60|$|We heard loud acclamations, {{which made}} us think {{something}} unusual was going on, {{and it was}} the publication of this precious edict. I wondered who they thought was going to attend to it when M. Darpent brought in a copy.
