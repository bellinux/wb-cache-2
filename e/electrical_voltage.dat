25|$|This {{equation}} also is {{a direct}} consequence of the linearity of Maxwell's equations. It is helpful to associate changing electric currents with a build-up or decrease of magnetic field energy. The corresponding energy transfer requires or generates a voltage. A mechanical analogy in the K=1 case with magnetic field energy (1/2)Li2 is a body with mass M, velocity u and kinetic energy (1/2)Mu2. The rate of change of velocity (current) multiplied with mass (inductance) requires or generates a force (an <b>electrical</b> <b>voltage).</b>|$|E
25|$|Britain's Great Western Railway {{introduced}} the Automatic Train Control (ATC) system in 1906. This {{system is the}} forerunner of today's Automatic Warning System (AWS) and consists of an electrical system that sounded a bell in the cab as the train approached a signal at clear. Power was fed through a metal ramp to a pickup {{on the underside of}} the locomotive to power the bell. An absence of the <b>electrical</b> <b>voltage</b> on the ramp caused a warning horn to sound in the locomotive's cab. The driver then had a set time to acknowledge the warning and start braking his train accordingly. If the driver did not acknowledge the warning, the brakes would be applied automatically. Where this was implemented, it did away with the need for fog signalling, since the driver could tell the state of the distant signal regardless of his ability to see it.|$|E

2500|$|On 26 October 2015, about 41,000 commuters were {{affected}} during morning peak hour when a power fault crippled the whole line from Punggol to Harbourfront stations. This {{is the first}} time that both the north- and south-bound service are affected which resulted in the mobilization of about 100 free shuttle buses across the NEL. The Alstom Metropolis C751C train was returning to the Sengkang Depot when the driver saw sparks from above the train and stopped the train [...] at a stretch where the mainline and depot catenary system wires overlap. This resulted in arching between the wires of the mainline and the depot. This caused the catenary system wires to melt and eventually snap.

40|$|In this paper, {{we report}} {{a new and}} simple {{electrical}} method to cancel crosstalk in the acoustical arrays. This solution has several advantages compared with that proposed in a previous paper (Bybi et al 2013) [17] where adapted <b>electrical</b> <b>voltages</b> were applied to each neighboring element of the active element {{in order to reduce}} the displacement field on their active surface. Firstly, it allows obtaining accurate correction <b>electrical</b> <b>voltages,</b> since it requires average electrical measurements (impedance and current measurements) instead of the displacement measurement in each point at the surface of the radiated element. In addition to this, the method does not need a laser vibrometer which is expensive in terms of time and difficult to use accurately for displacement measurement in water. To demonstrate the ability of the proposed solution an array composed of seven-elements, similar to those used in medical imaging and NDT applications, made of a conventional piezo-ceramic material PZT- 27 is fabricated. Then an electrical method based on electromechanical equivalent circuits for piezoelectric materials and motional current measurements is applied. The experimental and numerical results obtained demonstrate the ability of the proposed technique to reduce crosstalk as well as its robustness and ease of implementation...|$|R
