40|$|In the {{encoding}} {{phase of}} fractal image compression, {{most of the}} time is taken in finding the closest match between each range block and a large pool of domain blocks. We use the <b>intrablock</b> <b>variance</b> distributions of domain blocks to reduce the search space. For finding a close match, we need search only the domain blocks whose maximal <b>intrablock</b> <b>variance</b> quadrants are at the same corner as the range block. Thus, we reduce the number of transforms applied on each domain block from eight to two. We also adopt the longest-distance-first vector quantization scheme to divide the large pool of domain blocks into clusters. Thus, the number of domain blocks to be searched is also reduced. The experimental results show that our algorithm can reduce encoding time with only slight loss of quality. 2002 Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers.

40|$|Under a usual {{additive}} mixed model, a {{spectral decomposition}} {{is given to}} each observed vector Y from a class of block designs with arbitrarily unequal block sizes. As a result, an analysis of variance, in the sense defined by Graybill and Hultquist (1961) and Speed (1987), exist for such a design. The intrablock anova is discussed. Furthermore based on the dispersion structure, it is seen that the unbalancedness forces some useful information beyond the intrablock analysis, and even interblock comparisons. Let a group be a set of observations from the blocks of same sizes, a further decomposition of the spectral form provides an intergroup comparison which completes the anova of such designs.

40|$|General {{forms of}} the reduced {{coefficient}} matrix for estimation of treatment effects and the <b>intrablock</b> analysis of <b>variance</b> of row-column designs with n experimental units and v treatments are obtained from earlier work by the authors. These results are used to identify desirable properties for row-column designs with empty nodes. A need for such designs is apparent when the blocking criteria are implemented in sequence and empty nodes do not represent wasted experimental units. The construction and properties of three special classes of row-column designs with some empty nodes are iiscussed and examples given. In particular, it is shown that, if a row-column design belongs {{to one of these}} classes, then it is universally optimal for specified design parameters, where universally optimal designs are designs that maximize a generalized optimality criterion as defined by Kiefer.
