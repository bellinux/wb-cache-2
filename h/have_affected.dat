5|$|The {{affected}} {{animals are}} mostly young Asian elephants {{that had been}} born in captivity, with half the cases in North America being between the ages of one and four years (and three-quarters between one and eight years old). Some cases <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> newborns or adult elephants born in the wild (oldest aged 40 years), and three recorded cases <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> African elephants. The first documented fatal case for African elephants was Kijana, an eleven-month-old male in 1996. Since 2008, a number of cases have been attributed to EEHV1 among wild Asian elephants.|$|E

40|$|Result {{shows that}} {{innovation}} <b>has</b> <b>affected</b> quality significantly. Cost strategy <b>has</b> also <b>affected</b> quality significantly and also cost strategy <b>has</b> <b>affected</b> flexibility significantly. However, the cost strategy {{did not affect}} quality. Beside, quick delivery system {{did not affect the}} flexibility. The quality did not affect firm performances whereas the flexibility <b>has</b> <b>affected</b> firm performance significantly. This study attempts to investigate the effect of innovation, cost strategy and delivery system on the quality and flexibility in achieving high firm???s performances in foods and drinks industry. This research was undertaken in Makassar on 120 firms which are represented by staff, managers, directors, owners and HRD, using questionnaires. Types of firms which participated in the survey are individually owned firm, sole proprietary, commanditer and corporation which operate in the several Makassar suburb. The data were collected and analyzed by implementing Structural Equation Modeling. It shows that innovation <b>has</b> <b>affected</b> quality significantly. Cost strategy <b>has</b> also <b>affected</b> quality significantly and also cost strategy <b>has</b> <b>affected</b> flexibility significantly. However, the cost strategy did not affect quality. Beside, quick delivery system did not affect the flexibility. The quality did not affect firm performances whereas the flexibility <b>has</b> <b>affected</b> firm performance significantly...|$|R

5|$|Tropical storms {{are one of}} Arizona's main {{sources of}} rainfall, as they infuse the monsoon over the southwestern United States with moisture, {{producing}} large-scale floods in occasions.

5|$|A creative, hard-working, and {{technically}} gifted playmaker {{who played}} as an attacking midfielder, Gascoigne was capable both of scoring {{and setting up}} goals, due to his passing accuracy and his powerful striking ability. Gascoigne was gifted with pace, physical strength, balance, and excellent dribbling skills, which allowed him to protect the ball, beat opponents, and withstand physical challenges. Despite his talent, he was also criticised for his erratic behaviour and aggression on the pitch. His turbulent and often unhealthy lifestyle off the pitch, {{as well as his}} tendency to pick up injuries, is thought to <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> his career.|$|E

This list of tornadoes in the state is likely incomplete, as official records date back only to 1950 for tornadoes in the United States.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, the USACE {{was working}} to obtain funding, {{which was the}} major {{obstacle}} for completion; public concerns about the project were {{that it was not}} needed and would be too costly. The USACE announced in 1981 that an environmental impact report was necessary before the project could begin, following the Endangered Species Act of 1973; the least tern and light-footed clapper rail were considered endangered, and construction would <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> their habitat. The next year, the environmental impact report process began, funded by the USACE.|$|E

5|$|Darwin {{summarised}} his speculation in {{his essay}} on the Elevation of Patagonia. Though tentative, it challenged Lyell's ideas. Darwin drew on measurements by the Beagles officers {{as well as his}} own measurements to propose that the plains had been raised in successive stages by forces acting over a wide area, rather than smaller scale actions in a continuous movement. However, he supported Lyell in finding evidence to dismiss a sudden deluge when normal processes were suddenly speeded. Seashells he had found far inland still showing their colour suggested to him that the process had been relatively recent, and could <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> human history.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{richness}} of high-quality habitats in Yosemite, the brown bear, California condor, and least Bell's vireo have become extinct in the park within historical time, and another 37 species currently have special status under either California or federal endangered species legislation. The most serious current threats to Yosemite's wildlife and the ecosystems they occupy include loss of a natural fire regime, exotic species, air pollution, habitat fragmentation, and climate change. On a more local basis, factors such as road kills {{and the availability of}} human food <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> some wildlife species.|$|E
5|$|Ethnocentrism, tribalism, {{religious}} persecution, and prebendalism <b>have</b> <b>affected</b> Nigerian politics both prior {{and subsequent}} to independence in 1960. Kin-selective altruism {{has made its}} way into Nigerian politics, resulting in tribalist efforts to concentrate Federal power to a particular region of their interests. Nationalism has also led to active secessionist movements such as MASSOB, Nationalist movements such as Oodua Peoples Congress, Movement for the Emancipation of the Niger Delta and a civil war. Nigeria's three largest ethnic groups (Hausa, Igbo and Yoruba) have maintained historical preeminence in Nigerian politics; competition amongst these three groups has fuelled corruption and graft.|$|E
