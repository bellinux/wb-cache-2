40|$|Submitted to Advances in Statistical Climatology, Meteorology and Oceanography (ACSMO) The {{goal of the}} {{attribution}} of individual events is to estimate whether {{and to what extent}} the risk of an <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>event</b> evolves when external conditions (e. g. due to anthropogenic forcings) change. Many types of climate extremes are linked to the variability of the large-scale atmospheric circulation. It is hence essential to decipher the roles of atmospheric variability and increasing mean temperature in the change of probabilities of extremes. It is also crucial to define a background state (or counterfactual) to which recent observations are compared. In this paper we present a statistical framework to determine the 5 dynamical (linked to the atmospheric circulation) and thermodynamical (linked to slow forcings) contributions to the risk of <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>event.</b> We discuss the creation of two states (or " worlds ") in which risk change is determined. We illustrate this methodology on a record precipitation event that hit southern UK in January 2014.

40|$|This study {{addresses}} the spatial interpolation {{of one kind}} of <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>event</b> in Southland, New Zealand: air frosts. The presentation of temperature data as a continuous, interpolated surface, {{rather than as a}} set of individual points, facilitates an easier understanding of spatial patterns in the study area. The methodology developed in this study has potential application for mapping frost hazards for crop insurance companies, identifying microclimates for new crops, and is transferable to other types of data besides temperature. Spatial data have two characteristics: location and attribute. Location is represented using a coordinate system, usually in two dimensions (three dimensions is also possible). Latitude/Longitude and Grid Referencing are two systems that are commonly used in Geography. Attribute is the value of the variable of interest, e. g. temperature, vegetation or soi...|$|E
40|$|Crop yields need to {{increase}} by at least 70 % over the next 35 years {{in order to meet}} the global demands for food due to the increasing population and changing dietary preferences towards meat and dairy products in developing nations. Climate change threatens food security because pests and diseases that limit crop productivity are all sensitive to climate change and especially to more frequent extreme weather events. A more variable climate will mean greater uncertainty for crop yields because crop development stages, e. g. when reproductive organs such as flowers and seeds are produced, are especially vulnerable to short periods of extreme temperature or drought. For instance, Europe experienced an <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>event</b> during the summer of 2003 when temperatures were ca. 6 ??C higher and rainfall was ca. 300 mm less than the long-term mean values.

40|$|Variations {{and trends}} in <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> have {{recently}} received much attention {{since it is}} becoming more frequently and costly. <b>Extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> are happening on a certain time scale,being different from the abrupt climate change of climate system on the average state. The <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> had happened at orbit scales and Millennial-Centennial scales,such as Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum,the great warmth in Quaternary reflected by S 4,S 5 soils,and the severe dry-cold periods evidenced by the L 9 and L 15 at Chinese Loess Plateau,and the Younger Drays Event,the nine severe cold events respectively occurred in the last deglaciation and Holocene. These <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> appeared in the earth′s climate system under the background of different changes in temperature,however,there {{are a lot of}} uncertainties in their formation mechanism and representation. Since the 20 th century,many <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> such as droughts,floods,hurricanes and dust storms have taken place,which could not be explained only by the increasing of greenhouse gas,and the conclusion that the frequency and intensity of <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> would increase along with the global warming still remains uncertain. Therefore,it is neither scientific nor reasonable if we simply ascribe modern <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> to <b>climate</b> warming.

40|$|Investigating the {{processes}} {{that led to the}} end of the last interglacial period is relevant for understanding how our ongoing interglacial will end, which has been a matter of much debate. A recent ice core from Greenland demonstrates climate cooling from 122, 000 years ago driven by orbitally controlled insolation, with glacial inception at 118, 000 years ago. Here we present an annually resolved, layer-counted record of varve thickness, quartz grain size and pollen assemblages from a maar lake in the Eifel (Germany), which documents a late Eemian aridity pulse lasting 468 years with dust storms, aridity, bushfire and a decline of thermophilous trees at the time of glacial inception. We interpret the decrease in both precipitation and temperature as an indication of a close link of this <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>event</b> to a sudden southward shift of the position of the North Atlantic drift, the ocean current that brings warm surface waters to the northern European region.

40|$|Extreme climate events, {{including}} {{floods and}} droughts, represent disturbances that impact plant functioning, biodiversity and ecosystem processes. Wetlands can mediate climate change impacts through their multiple ecosystem services, and wet grasslands offer a fascinating wetland case {{because they are}} adapted to regular disturbance regimes typified by inundation, cutting and/or grazing. This review identifies key concepts for {{a better understanding of}} extreme climate impacts on wet grassland plant communities, focussing upon the use of functional traits for ecological resilience. It suggests that wet grasslands are underrepresented in <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>event</b> experiments, despite some field studies that show floods have significant impacts upon community composition. Mechanisms for ecological stability and resilience are linked to functional diversity through plant traits, via niche complementarity or dominance. Facilitation may be important as climate stresses increase, while modified plant behaviour may promote recovery. However, plant community responses to extreme events are complex; the challenges for wet grassland researchers include: (i) identifying thresholds, tipping points and lag effects; (ii) monitoring key community components; (iii) using effective plant trait metrics; (iv) investigating beyond conservative norms; (v) combining multiple stressors and traits and (vi) extrapolating experimental results to field conditions...|$|E

We studied {{the effect of}} droughts and unusually cold periods on Pinus sylvestris tree-ring width and wood anatomy. Study sites were selected along an altitudinal gradient on Vitosha Mountain, Bulgaria. Drought conditions caused the formation of narrow tree rings or light rings if the drought occurred in July–August at the lower altitude sites. In years with droughts in June and {{the first half of}} July, followed by precipitation in the middle of July, intra-annual density fluctuations (IADFs) were formed. Trees in the zone with optimal growth con-ditions produced fewer light rings and narrow rings in years with either strongest droughts or unusually cold summers. At the timberline zone, low summer temperature triggered narrow tree rings and light rings. Frost rings were formed when there was a drop in temperatures below the freezing point {{in the second half of}} May or at the beginning of June. Our findings show that studies of tree-ring anat-omy may contribute to obtain further knowledge about extreme climatic events in the Balkan Peninsula and in other regions where meteorological data lack...|$|E

40|$|In {{a global}} warming scenario, drought and heat waves {{like the one}} that {{occurred}} in 2003 in Europe are expected to become more intense and frequent. This <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>event</b> strongly affected the hydraulic balance in many forest tree species including Douglas-fir, with symptoms ranging from partial crown necrosis to death. We studied a French Douglas-fir provenance trial, strongly affected by the 2003 drought and heat wave. Using wood X-ray microdensity profiles as a record of cambium response to environmental variations, we compared mean stem density and growth between dead and alive neighbouring trees and several microdensity characters measured over 17 growth rings previous to 2003. Special attention has been given to the sampling layout in order to minimize the micro-environmental effects. At tree level, surviving trees have a significantly higher mean stem density. At tree ring level, they have a significantly higher mean ring density, maximum ring density, latewood density and, to a lesser extent, latewood proportion. No significant difference was found for diameter growth. These results could have direct implications in the way to study and predict possible acclimation and adaptation of forest trees to climate change process. Wood could be used for the selection of genotypes with a desirable plasticity and resistance to drought induced-cavitation...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Drought is {{a natural}} hazard {{characterized}} by below-normal precipitation, which could persist for several months or even years. This recurrent <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>event</b> can cause crop damage and yield loss, which could inflict negative socioeconomic impacts all over the world. As an agricultural country, the Philippines is highly susceptible to adverse impacts of drought. Unfortunately, the country has no established method capable of characterizing agricultural drought. The Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) is currently equipped with indices tailored for detecting and monitoring meteorological drought. This paper proposes a satellite-derived agricultural drought index called Standardized Vegetation and Temperature Ratio (SVTR), {{which can be used}} to detect current and historical Philippine drought occurrences. Land products acquired from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS), such as Land Surface Temperature (LST) and Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), were used to devise the localized agricultural drought index. The performance of the SVTR was evaluated through the use of an existing drought metric, drought-induced crop damage reports, and other drought validation efforts. The results showed that SVTR can provide a cost-effective, near-real-time approach for detecting and assessing agricultural drought events in the country. This drought index may aid in decision-making process of crop managers, policymakers and government agencies toward drought preparedness and mitigation, as well as improved crop planning and management...|$|E
40|$|As the {{atmospheric}} carbon dioxide (CO 2) increases substantially, the {{spatial distribution of}} atmospheric CO 2 should be considered when estimating the effects of CO 2 on the carbon and water cycle coupling of terrestrial ecosystems. To evaluate this effect on future ecohydrological processes, the spatial-temporal patterns of CO 2 were established over 1951 - 2099 according to the IPCC emission scenarios SRES A 2 and SRES B 1. Thereafter, water use efficiency (WUE) was used (i. e., Net Primary Production/Evaportranspiration) as an indicator to quantify the {{effects of climate change}} and uneven CO 2 fertilization in China. We carried out several simulated experiments to estimate WUE under different future scenarios using a land process model (Integrated Biosphere Simulator, IBIS). Results indicated that the geographical distributions of averaged WUE have considerable differences under a heterogeneous atmospheric CO 2 condition. Under the SRES A 2 scenario, WUE decreased slightly with a 5 % value in most areas of the southeastern and northwestern China during the 2050 s, while decreasing by approximately 15 % in southeastern China during the 2090 s. During the period of the 2050 s under SRES B 1 scenario, the change rate of WUE was similar with that under SRES A 2 scenario, but the WUE has a more moderate decreasing trend than that under the SRES A 2 scenario. In all, the ecosystems in median and low latitude areas had a weakened effect on resisting <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>event</b> such as drought.

40|$|The {{present study}} bridges {{the field of}} {{happiness}} economics with the economics of climate change, based on two research questions. One {{is related to the}} effects of (<b>extreme)</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> on individual happiness and their qualitative measurement. The empirical method to analyze this relation includes the identification of proxies of <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> and studying their relationships with well-being for the impacted population. Here floods, and to some extent forest fires, are taken as an approximation of <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events.</b> The second research question concerns the way happiness studies can inform climate policy and how stringent climate policy would affect well-being. Assuming that effective climate abatement implies a reduction in the rate of economic (income) growth and carbon intensive consumption, I look at how income decline influences subjective well-being {{in the context of the}} economic crisis in Spain. To explore the happiness effect of a wider range of climate change mitigation strategies, including ones which are not solely policy-oriented, the sharing of goods is also taken as a case of a community-based initiative resulting in a reduction of greenhouse gas emissions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Extinction and re-colonisation {{of local}} populations {{is common in}} ephemeral {{habitats}} such as temporary streams. In most cases, such population turnover leads to reduced genetic diversity within populations and increased genetic differentiation among populations due to stochastic founder events, genetic drift, and bottlenecks associated with re-colonisation. Here, we examined the spatio-temporal genetic structure of 8 alpine caddisfly populations inhabiting permanent and temporary streams from four valleys in two regions of the Swiss Alps in years before and after a major stream drying event, the European heat wave in summer 2003. Results We found that population turnover after 2003 led {{to a loss of}} allelic richness and gene diversity but not to significant changes in observed heterozygosity. Within all valleys, permanent and temporary streams in any given year were not differentiated, suggesting considerable gene flow and admixture between streams with differing hydroperiods. Large changes in allele frequencies after 2003 resulted in a substantial increase in genetic differentiation among valleys within one to two years (1 - 2 generations) driven primarily by drift and immigration. Signatures of genetic bottlenecks were detected in all 8 populations after 2003 using the M -ratio method, but in no populations when using a heterozygosity excess method, indicating differential sensitivity of bottleneck detection methods. Conclusions We conclude that genetic differentiation among A. uncatus populations changed markedly both temporally and spatially in response to the <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>event</b> in 2003. Our results highlight the magnitude of temporal population genetic changes in response to extreme events. More specifically, our results show that extreme events can cause rapid genetic divergence in metapopulations. Further studies are needed to determine if recovery from this perturbation through gradual mixing of diverged populations by migration and gene flow leads to the pre-climate event state, or whether the observed changes represent a new genetic equilibrium. </p...|$|E
40|$|Drought is a {{recurrent}} <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>event</b> with tremendous hazard for every specter of natural environment and human lives. Drought analysis usually involves characterizing drought severity, duration and intensity. Similar {{to most of}} the hydrological problems, such characteristic variables are usually not independent. Copula, as a model of multivariate distribution, widely used in finance, actuarial analysis, has won increasingly popularity in hydrological study. Here, the study has two major focuses: (1) fit drought characteristics from Streamflow Drought Index (SDI) or Standardized Runoff Index (SRI) to appropriate copulas, then using fitted copulas to estimate conditional drought severity distribution and joint return periods for both historical time period 1920 - 2009 and future time period 2020 - 2090. SDI is calculated based on long term observed streamflow while SRI is based on simulated future runoff. Parameters estimation of marginal distribution and copulas are provided, with goodness fit measures as well; (2) investigate the effects of climate change on the frequency and severity of droughts. In order to quantify the impact, three drought indices have been proposed for this study to characterize the drought duration, severity and intensity changes under the climate change in Upper Klamath River Basin. Since drought can be defined as different types, such as meteorological drought, agricultural drought, hydrological drought and social economical drought, this study chooses Standardized Precipitation Index (SPI), Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) and Surface Water Supply Index (SWSI) to estimate the meteorological, agricultural and hydrological drought, respectively. Climate change effects come from three sources: the inherent reason, the human activity and the GCMs uncertainties. Therefore, the results show the long term drought condition by calculating yearly drought indices, and compared in three ways: First, compare drought characteristics of future time periods with base period; second, show the uncertainties of three greenhouse gas emission scenarios; third, present the uncertainties of six General Circulation Models (GCMs) ...|$|E
40|$|Background: Health effects {{induced by}} climate, weather and climatic change may act {{directly}} or indirectly on human physiology. The future total burden of global warming is uncertain, but in some areas and for specific outcomes, mortality and morbidity are likely to increase. One likely effect of global warming is {{an increasing number of}} extreme weather events, such as floods, storms and heat waves. The excess numbers of specific health outcomes attributable to climate-induced events can be estimated. This paper compares approaches for estimating excess numbers of outcomes associated with climate extremes, exemplified by a case study of hospital admissions during the extremely warm summer of 2006 in southern Sweden. Materials and methods: Daily hospital admission data were obtained from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare for six hospitals in the Skåne region of southern Sweden for the period 1998 to 2006. Daily temperature data for the region were obtained from the meteorological station in the city of Malmö. We used four established approaches for estimating the daily excess numbers associated with extreme heat. Time series of daily event rates were assumed to follow a Poisson distribution. Excess event rates were compared by using several approaches, such as standardised event ratios and generalised additive models to estimate the health risks attributable to the <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>event.</b> Results: The four approaches yielded vastly different results. The estimates of excess were considerably biased when not accounting for time trends in previous years’ data. Three of four approaches showed a significant increase in excess hospitalisation rates attributable to the heat episode in Skåne in 2006. However, modelling the effect of temperature failed to describe the risks induced by the extreme heat. Conclusion: Estimates of excess events depend greatly on the approach used. Further research is needed to identify which method yielded the most accurate estimates. However, one of the approaches used generally seem to perform better than the others in estimating the excess rates associated with the heat episode. Further on, estimating relative risks of temperature or other determinants of disease may fail to incorporate the unique characteristics of particular weather events, such as the effect caused by very persistent heat exposure. Unless this can be incorporated into predictive models, such models may be less appropriate to use when predicting the future burden of heat waves on human health...|$|E
40|$|<b>Extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> can {{interact}} synergistically with invasions to dramatically alter ecosystem structure, function, and services. Yet, {{the effects of}} <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> on species invasions remain unresolved. <b>Extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> may increase resources and decrease biotic resistance by causing physiological stress and/or mortality of native taxa, resulting in invasion opportunities for nonnative species. Alternatively, <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> may regulate nonnative populations, preventing them from achieving dominance. We examined whether a sequence of three cold spells had a negative or positive effect on fish invasions in the coastal Everglades. We compared resistance (initial effects) and resilience (rate of recovery) to the cold spells between native fishes and the dominant nonnative invader, the Mayan cichlid, across eight populations expanding two mangroves drainages in the southern Everglades. We tracked native fish and nonnative Mayan cichlid populations for 10 yr including 3 yr pre- and 4 yr post-cold spells. In both drainages, native fishes were more resistant to the cold spells than the nonnative species. While native fishes experienced declines at only one site, nonnative Mayan numbers were reduced by 90 – 100 % across six sites where they were abundant pre-disturbances. Four years after the last cold spell, we saw limited resilience in the affected nonnative populations. Only {{one of the six}} affected sites fully recovered, whereas the other five sites showed no recovery in Mayan cichlid numbers. The recovered site was closest to a canal, known to act as thermal refuges for nonnative fishes. In summary, cold spells can reduce nonnative abundances, but whether cold spells can effectively knock back invasions (and range expansions) by tropical/subtropical nonnative species will depend on how the frequency and severity of cold spells are affected by climate change. We propose that these mortality-causing extreme events could provide rare management opportunities late in an invasion...|$|R
40|$|Based on the {{historical}} records of the annual increase in the workforce (men older than 16 years of age), the annual new taxed cropland in the Shengjing area (Northeast China), the <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> in North China, and related management policies in Northeast China during 1661 - 1680, a case study has been conducted to investigate {{the relationship between the}} <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> in North China and the migration to Northeast China for cultivation. This study has found that the migration to Northeast China for cultivation from 1661 to 1680 was a response to the drought events that occurred in North China. The upsurge of migration, which occurred in 1665 - 1680, was a response to the drought period during 1664 - 1680 in North China while the fewer disasters period in Northeast China. There were three migratory peaks during the upsurge of migration, which corresponded to the three drought events. The peaks of migration, however, often lagged behind the drought events about 1 - 2 years. The encouraging-migration policy, which was adopted to encourage cultivation in Northeast China, did not produce much migration into the region in the early Cling Dynasty. It did, however, provide a policy background, which ensured more than 10000 migrants per year to Northeast China when North China suffered from drought/flood disasters. As a response to the highest peak of migration induced by the severe droughts in North China during 1664 - 1667, a prohibiting-migration policy restricted further migration to Northeast China was carried out in 1668. Although the prohibiting-migration policy could not entirely stop the migrants fleeing from famine in North China to Northeast China, the migrants and cultivation were significantly reduced under the policy. The frequent changes of the policy on the years when taxation started after the land was cultivated were also related to <b>climate</b> <b>events.</b> The <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> in North China, migration to Northeast China for cultivation, and the related management policies showed an impact-response chain, which reflected the interaction among <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events,</b> human behavior, and policies...|$|R

40|$|Paleoclimate {{research}} {{is currently a}} hot topic in the international debate on how greenhouse-gas emissions affect climate change. Now {{that the idea of}} unavoidable global warming {{by the end of this}} century is commonly accepted, interest in the early Paleogene climate changes is increasing. During this period, Earths climate experienced episodes of rapid global warming and massive injections of carbon dioxide are linked to these transient temperature anomalies. The Paleocene-Eocene thermal maximum (PETM) at the Paleocene-Eocene (P-E ~ 55. 8 Ma) boundary is the most <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>event</b> as it represents a rapid worldwide 5 - 8 &# 176;C warming of Earths surface as well as the deep oceans, associated with large changes in ocean chemistry (ocean acidification). In addition, the PETM is recognized as a critical evolutionary turning point in, which the biosphere was reorganized on a global scale. Unique faunal and floral extinction, radiation and migration patterns are recognized in both terrestrial and marine ecosystems, including a major extinction in deep-sea foraminiferal faunas. In order to establish clear biogeographic patterns of how shallow marine ecosystems responded to the climate changes during the PETM, I studied the benthic foraminiferal distributions in neritic (< 200 m water depth) settings in the Northern Hemisphere. During my PhD, I explored the Tunisian Basins and the North Atlantic Coastal Plain in the United States, and compared them to the well-studied Egyptian Basin. I discussed the various aspects of the environmental parameters controlling the benthic foraminiferal distributions and correlated the P-E boundary within the studied basins. The overall result is a synthesis of the short-term biotic response to the PETM. In general, stable latest Paleocene benthic foraminiferal assemblages were in all studied location abruptly replaced by more stress-tolerant faunas during the early stages of the PETM. Our observations indicate that the PETM exerted worldwide environmental stress on benthic foraminiferal communities, triggering prominent transient changes in population structures and biodiversity. Yet the evolutionary impact was minor compared to the deep-sea extinction event. This implies the existence of refugia on the shelves. The increase in abundance of stress-tolerant faunas reflects more stressed dysoxic to anoxic eutrophic marine environments, due to higher nutrient delivery and stratification of the water column. These hypoxic conditions occurred in the early stages of the PETM continually or with high frequencies and evolved towards periodic (seasonal?) oxygen depletion during the later stages of peak warming or initial recovery. The final recovery phase reflects a reoxygenation of the sea floor. These eutrophic conditions remained stable and continued in the aftermath of the PETM and the bottom waters became permanently reoxygenated. Although paleogeographic and climate conditions were different than those of today, the PETM offers insights of how modern regional shelf ecosystems may respond to the massive anthropogenic input of carbon dioxide. This study reveals that benthic foraminifera living on the shelf are not immune to the environmental degradation during global warming and benthic ecosystems will undergo significant transient changes in species composition as global peak warming takes place. <w:latentstyles deflockedstate="false" defunhidewhenused="true"  <w:lsdexception="" locked="false" priority=" 0 " semihidden="false"nrpages: 276 status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|All {{around the}} world, cities enhance their economic, {{cultural}} and social attractiveness increasing population and infrastructures. In a global context of climate change, the urban area's environmental footprint and sustainability need to be investigated and monitored, {{in the attempt to}} find strategies to reduce negative effects. Concerning climate changes, recent world climate reports stress the increasing severity and duration of heat waves. These increases will likely be more strongly felt in urban areas due to the urban heat island effect (UHI) that leads cities to have higher air and surface temperatures compared to rural areas. Pollution plays a negative role that is not only difficult to control but also affects health and aggravates heat-related climate change impacts. UHI effects and heat waves are likely to increase future energy demand. In the United States, for example, an estimated 3 % to 8 % of annual electricity use is required to reduce UHI effects (Ruth and Gasper, 2008). To face rising temperatures there often is no other solution than using air-conditioning. That leads to a vicious circle, as massive air conditioning has been shown to increase UHI effects up to 1 °C (Hallegatte et al. 2008). Moreover, the expansion of the air-conditioning market has increased the electrical energy consumption and peak power demand (Givoni 1994; Chiesa et al. 2014). This trend has an important effect on the GHG since the emission factor for electricity consumption is high, as shown for Europe in the specific technical annex to the SEAP template (European Commission, 2010). While the developed countries seem to increasingly engage such issues, developing countries have to face the challenges of a fast growing population and increasing economic activity with a lower availability of basic infrastructures and a relatively young capital of skills and knowledge. The air-conditioning market in emerging countries is rising quickly, with a 70 % growth in the past 5 years (Dalkin Industries, 2015). Indian big cities show all the above-mentioned problems: pollution, extreme temperatures and increasing use of A/C together with a general and exponential growth of energy consumption. The rapid economic development of India means an increase of the standards of living and expectations of the middle classes. Per capita consumption is exploding due to the rising equipment rate fueled by the motivation to reach comfortable conditions (Fernandes, 2006), namely those that are considered "basic" in Western countries (A/C, washing machine, dishwasher, laptop, refrigerator). This leads to serious environmental but also functional problems, i. e. energy shortages that can affect thousands and even millions of people, as happened in July 2012 (over 300 million people affected). To date, a ferocious construction rhythm and qualitatively poor and climate-inadequate architectural solutions characterize the building sector in India. Residential buildings mostly share the same typology, with thin walls, lack of shading systems, and lack of insulation especially on the roof. They are vulnerable to the high tropical temperatures and to <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>event,</b> harboring {{at the same time a}} rising demand for better levels of thermal comfort coming from the middle classes. For that reason, they are quickly shifting toward total dependency on air conditioning, with consistent effects on energy consumption, health and urban climate...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} encompasses three chapters {{that study}} {{the extent to}} which natural disasters and social assistance programs affect children's schooling, child labor, and children’s health in developing countries. Below are the individual abstracts for each chapter. Chapter 1 : Bearing the Burden of Natural Disasters: Child Labor and Schooling in the Aftermath of Tropical Storm Stan in Guatemala This paper exploits an <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>event,</b> Tropical Storm Stan, which devastated Guatemala in 2005, to identify the short-term impact of a large-scale disaster on children's schooling and child labor. The empirical strategy exploits time and spatial variation in the intensity of the shock. The paper uses a self-reported measure of shock exposure collected by a nationally representative household survey six to twelve months after the disaster. In addition, the paper uniquely incorporates an external administrative measure of exposure that captures the direct value of damages caused by the storm in each Guatemalan department. Results emphasize that child labor {{is an important part of}} family self-insurance strategies and that a great deal of heterogeneity by gender and age exists in terms of how children’s time allocation was affected by the storm. The shock led to a significant increase in child labor for children aged 13 to 15 and school participation decreased only for male children. By contrast, findings suggest that children aged 7 to 12 tended to not bear the burden of the disaster. Results are robust to alternative specifications, including an instrumental variable strategy. Chapter 2 : Persistent Impact of Natural Disasters on Child Nutrition and Schooling: Evidence from the 1999 Colombian Earthquake This paper studies the impact of the 1999 Colombian Earthquake on child nutrition and schooling. The identification strategy combines household survey data with event data on the timing and location of the earthquake, exploiting the exogenous exposure of children to the shock. The paper uniquely identifies both the short- and medium-term impacts of the earthquake, combining two cross-sectional household surveys collected before the earthquake and two cross-sectional household surveys collected one and six years after the earthquake. Colombia provides a unique setting for our study because the government launched a very successful reconstruction program after the earthquake. Findings report a strong negative impact of the earthquake on child nutrition and schooling in the short-term. Relevantly, amid the aid received by the affected area, the negative consequences of the earthquake persist with a lesser degree in the medium-term, particularly for boys. Chapter 3 : Who Else Benefits from Conditional Cash Transfer Programs? Indirect Effects on Siblings in Nicaragua Conditional Cash Transfer (CCT) welfare programs encourage households to invest in the human capital of their children. They offer eligible families cash in exchange for commitments, such as sending children from targeted populations to school. When this educational requirement can be met via the school attendance of only certain children within a household, other siblings within the same household might be indirectly affected in both positive and negative ways. This paper reports on new evidence from Nicaragua's Red de Proteccion Social CCT program, which targets educational grants only to children aged 7 to 13 who have not completed 4 th grade. I analyze the indirect effects within households on the schooling and employment of two groups of non-targeted siblings: those aged 9 to 13 who have already completed 4 th grade and those aged 14 to 17, who are too old to be eligible. Results suggest positive schooling effects within the households for older, non-targeted siblings, with higher impacts for boys than girls. Indeed, the enrollment gains for male siblings come hand in hand with a reduction of their labor supply...|$|E

The results show that for the present case PRECIS simulates well the spatial distribution of <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> when compared with observations. In the future the occurrence of hot events is projected to be more frequent and the growing season will lengthen, while the occurrence of cold events is likely to be much rarer. A warming environment will also give rise to changes in extreme precipitation events. There would be an overall increasing trend in extreme precipitation events over most of China. The southeast coastal zone, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River and North China are projected to experience more extreme precipitation than the present...|$|R

40|$|Malawi suffers {{frequent}} droughts and floods. In {{an economy}} that is heavily dependent on the agricultural sector, it is crucial to understand the implications of these <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events.</b> Not only are rural livelihoods affected due to the severe impacts on the agricultural sector, but nonfarm and urban households are also vulnerable given the strong production and price linkages between agriculture {{and the rest of the}} economy. This study uses a general equilibrium model to estimate the economywide impacts of drought- and flood-related crop production losses. Climate simulations are based on production loss estimates from stochastic drought and flood models. Model results show that the economic losses due to <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> are significant: Malawi loses 1. 7 percent of its gross domestic product on average every year due to the combined effects of droughts and floods. This is equivalent to almost US$ 22 million in 2005 prices. Given their crop choices, it is smaller-scale farmers and those in the flood-prone southern regions of the country who are worst affected. However, urban and nonfarm households are not spared. Food shortages lead to sharp price increases that reduce urban households� disposable incomes. This study makes an important contribution by estimating the economywide impacts of <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events.</b> However, this is only the first step toward designing appropriate agricultural and development strategies that explicitly account for climate uncertainty. agricultural sector, CGE Modeling, Droughts, floods, Gross Domestic Product (GDP), households, Livelihoods, Poverty,...|$|R

40|$|Monitoring <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events</b> is {{of great}} importance, mainly due to {{increasingly}} severe impacts of <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> on nature and humanity. However, the characteristics of <b>extreme</b> <b>climate</b> <b>events,</b> especially <b>extreme</b> precipitation, frequently show complex variations {{in the context of}} climate change. Taking the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River (MLR-YR) in China as a case study, extreme daily precipitation during 1961 – 2012 was analyzed from the aspects of frequency and intensity. The changes in extreme daily precipitation in the MLR-YR were further attributed to several factors, including large-scale circulation, hydrologic engineering and local topography. Our analyses indicate that both frequency and intensity of the extreme daily precipitation in the MLR-YR showed overall increasing trends from 1961 to 2012. The increase could be associated with weakened East Asian summer monsoon in past decades. In addition, inverse trends could also be found locally between the frequency and the intensity. For instance, extreme precipitation intensity revealed an enhanced trend {{in the western part of}} the middle reach of the Yangtze River, while extreme precipitation frequency showed decreasing trends in this region. These phenomena could be associated with the effects of some local factors (e. g., lake regulation, hydropower engineering, topography). Our study highlights the important role of local factors on extreme precipitation changes...|$|R
