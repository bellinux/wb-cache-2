2500|$|Days after Novak's initial column appeared, Matthew Cooper of Time {{magazine}} published Plame's name, citing unnamed {{government officials}} as sources. In his article, titled [...] "A War on Wilson?", Cooper {{raises the possibility}} that the White House has [...] "declared war" [...] on Wilson for speaking out against the Bush Administration. Cooper initially refused to testify before the grand jury, and was prepared to defy a court order and spend time in jail to protect his sources. At a court hearing, where Cooper was expected to be ordered to jail, Cooper told U.S. District Judge Thomas Hogan: [...] "I am prepared to testify. I will comply. Last night <b>I</b> <b>hugged</b> my son good-bye and told him it might {{be a long time before}} I see him again. I went to bed ready to accept the sanctions." [...] Cooper explained that before his court appearance, he had received [...] "in somewhat dramatic fashion" [...] a direct personal communication from his source freeing him from his commitment to keep the source's identity secret. In an interview with National Review, Robert Luskin, Rove's attorney, stated: [...] "Cooper's lawyer called us and said, 'Can you confirm that the waiver [...] encompasses Cooper?' I was amazed...So I said, 'Look, I understand that you want reassurances. If Fitzgerald would like Karl to provide you with some other assurances, we will.'" [...] Cooper testified before the grand jury and wrote an account of his testimony for Time. Cooper told the grand jury his sources for his article, [...] "A War on Wilson?", were Karl Rove and Scooter Libby.|$|E

5000|$|In {{languages}} with ergative-absolutive alignment, {{the passive}} voice (where {{the object of}} a transitive verb becomes the subject of an intransitive verb) does not make sense, because the noun associated with the intransitive verb is marked as the object, not as the subject. Instead, these often have an antipassive voice. In this context, the subject of a transitive verb is promoted to the [...] "object" [...] of the corresponding intransitive verb. In the context of a nominative-accusative language like English, this promotion is nonsensical because intransitive verbs don't take objects, they take subjects, and so the subject of a transitive verb ("I" [...] in <b>I</b> <b>hug</b> him) is also the subject of the intransitive passive construction (<b>I</b> was <b>hugged</b> by him). But in an ergative-absolutive language like Dyirbal, [...] "I" [...] in the transitive <b>I</b> <b>hug</b> him would take the ergative case, but the [...] "I" [...] in <b>I</b> was <b>hugged</b> would take the absolutive, and so by analogy the antipassive construction more closely resembles *was hugged me. Thus in this example, the ergative is promoted to the absolutive, and the agent (i.e. him), which was formerly marked by the absolutive, is deleted to form the antipassive voice (or is marked in a different way, {{in the same way that}} in the English passive voice can still be specified as the agent of the action using by him in <b>I</b> was <b>hugged</b> by him—for example, Dyirbal puts the agent in the dative case, and Basque retains the agent in the absolutive).|$|R

2500|$|Nel Noddings {{draws an}} {{important}} distinction between natural caring and ethical caring (1984, 81-83). Noddings distinguishes between acting because [...] "I want" [...] and acting because [...] "I must". When I care for someone because [...] "I want" [...] to care, say <b>I</b> <b>hug</b> a friend who needs hugging {{in an act of}} love, Noddings claims that I am engaged in natural caring. When I care for someone because [...] "I must" [...] care, say <b>I</b> <b>hug</b> an acquaintance who needs hugging in spite of my desire to escape that person's pain, according to Noddings, I am engaged in ethical caring. Ethical caring occurs when a person acts caringly out of a belief that caring is the appropriate way of relating to people. When someone acts in a caring way because that person naturally cares for another, the caring is not ethical caring (1984, 79-80). Noddings' claims that ethical caring is based on, and so dependent on, natural caring (1984, 83, 206 fn 4). It is through experiencing others caring for them and naturally caring for others that people build what is called an [...] "ethical ideal", an image of the kind of person they want to be.|$|R

Whether I was glad or sorry I could not tell. My thoughts were all in hopeless confusions. When she spoke, there was a certain reserve in her tone.

60|$|Having {{no desire}} to awaken their nasty tempers upon such a night as this, where so much {{depended}} upon secrecy and dispatch, <b>I</b> <b>hugged</b> {{the shadows of the}} buildings, ready at an instant's warning to leap into the safety of a nearby door or window. Thus I moved silently to the great gates which opened upon the street {{at the back of the}} court, and as I neared the exit I called softly to my two animals. How I thanked the kind providence which had given me the foresight to win the love and confidence of these wild dumb brutes, for presently from the far side of the court I saw two huge bulks forcing their way toward me through the surging mountains of flesh.|$|E
60|$|How correct Bertie Messener was I never dreamed. I {{decided that}} he was an alarmist. As for myself, I was content to remain and watch the fun. After I dropped him, instead of going {{directly}} home, I went on in a hunt for more food. To my surprise, I learned that the small groceries where I had bought in the morning were sold out. I extended my search to the Potrero, and by good luck managed to pick up another box of candles, two sacks of wheat flour, ten pounds of graham flour (which would do for the servants), a case of tinned corn, and two cases of tinned tomatoes. It did look as though {{there was going to be}} at least a temporary food shortage, and <b>I</b> <b>hugged</b> myself over the goodly stock of provisions I had laid in.|$|E

Once, indeed, I lifted an accusing arm to heaven. It was as if I had pulled the string of a douche-bath. Heaven flooded the fool with gratuitous tears; and the fool sat in the puddle of them and knew his folly. But heaven {{at the same time}} mercifully veiled that figure of abasement: and I will lift but a corner of the sheet.|$|E

60|$|Saturday came. The {{members of}} the hunt were mostly boys {{who lived in the}} neighbourhood; so the {{arrangement}} was that at half-past two we should meet at the turnpike gate outside the Spaniards. I brought my lunch with me and ate it in Regent's Park, and then took the 'bus to the Heath. One by one the others came up. Beyond mere glances, none of them took any notice of me. I was wearing my ordinary clothes over my jersey. I knew they thought I had come merely to see them start, and <b>I</b> <b>hugged</b> to myself the dream of the surprise that was in store for them, and of which I should be the hero. He came, one of the last, our leader and chief, and I sidled up behind him and waited, while he busied himself organising and constructing.|$|E
6000|$|Two {{thousand}} feet, probably, we {{mounted to}} what Frank called Little Buckskin. In the west a copper glow, ridged with lead-colored clouds, marked {{where the sun}} had set.

Frank solicitously remarked that I looked [...] "sort of beat." [...] Jim built a roaring fire and began getting supper. A snow squall came on the rushing wind. The air grew colder, and though <b>I</b> <b>hugged</b> the fire, I could not get warm. When I had satisfied my hunger, I rolled out my sleeping-bag and crept into it.
