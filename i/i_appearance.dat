(ii) While we have the massless Dirac dispersion only around E= 0, the anomalous QHE associated with the Dirac cone unexpectedly persists {{for a wide range}} of the chemical potential. The range is bounded by van Hove singularities, at which we predict a transition to the ordinary fermion behavior acompanied by huge jumps in the QHE with a sign change. (iii) For edges we establish a coincidence between the quantum Hall effect in the bulk and the quantum Hall effect for the edge states, which is a manifestation of the topological bulk-edge correspondence.

40|$|International audienceImage {{segmentation}} is, in general, an ill-posed {{problem and}} additional constraints {{need to be}} imposed {{in order to achieve}} the desired segmentation result. While segmenting organs in medical images, which is the topic of this paper, a significant amount of prior knowledge about the shape, appearance, and location of the organs is available {{that can be used to}} constrain the solution space of the segmentation problem. Among the various types of prior information, the incorporation of prior information about shape, in particular, is very challenging. In this paper, we present an explicit shape-constrained MAP-MRFbased contour evolution method for the segmentation of organs in 2 D medical images. Specifically, we represent the segmentation contour explicitly as a chain of control points. We then cast the segmentation problem as a contour evolution problem, wherein the evolution of the contour is performed by iteratively solving a MAP-MRF labeling problem. The evolution of the contour is governed by three types of prior information, namely: (<b>i)</b> <b>appearance</b> prior, (ii) boundary-edgeness prior, and (iii) shape prior, each of which are incorporated as clique potentials into the MAP-MRF problem. We use the master-slave dual decomposition framework to solve the MAP-MRF labeling problem in each iteration. In our experiments, we demonstrate the application of the proposed method to the challenging problem of heart segmentation in non-contrast computed tomography data...|$|E

30|$|Finally, {{peculiar}} dependences of the PL {{decay time}} on the excitation and detection energies are revealed in the multilayer In 0.4 Ga 0.6 As/GaAs QD chain sample and ascribed to the peculiarities of the carrier and energy relaxation caused by both immediate electronic interdot coupling and long-range coupling through the radiation field. Summarizing, we have established: <b>i)</b> <b>appearance</b> of low temperature asymmetry of the PL band caused by the non-thermal carrier distribution through in-chain interdot wave function coupling. The energy scheme of the In 0.4 Ga 0.6 As/GaAs QD chain sample is specified and 1 D WL, 2 D InGaAs WL, and the heavy hole excited states are identified from the temperature cw PL measurements: ii) the in-chain interdot carrier transfer forms the swing of the decay time τd versus detection energy dependence {{and can lead to}} the state saturation effect shifting the maximal τd value close to QD PL maximum; iii) superradiant mode of the emission field couples the QDs of different dot chains and leads to a significant change of the decay time value just {{in the vicinity of the}} QD PL maximum. This radiant interdot coupling defines the dependence of the τd value on the excitation wavelength. Coexistence of various mechanisms of interdot coupling is determined here by special design of the QD samples providing effective interdot in-chain electronic coupling and effective radiative interchain coupling due to superradiance. This latter type of coupling could play a significant role in ultrafast applications.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a non-standard generalized model of gravity coupled to a neutral scalar "inflaton" {{as well as}} to the fields of the electroweak bosonic sector. The essential new ingredient is employing two alternative non-Riemannian space-time volume-forms (non-Riemannian volume elements, or covariant integration measure densitities) independent of the space-time metric. The latter are defined in terms of auxiliary antisymmentric tensor gauge fields, which although not introducing any additional propagating degrees of freedom, trigger a series of important features such as: (<b>i)</b> <b>appearance</b> of two infinitely large flat regions of the effective "inflaton" potential in the corresponding Einstein frame with vastly different scales corresponding to the "early" and "late" epochs of Universe's evolution; (ii) dynamical generation of Higgs-like spontaneous symmetry breaking effective potential for the SU(2) × U(1) iso-doublet electroweak scalar in the late universe, whereas it remains massless in the "early" universe. Next, to stabilize the quintessential dynamics, we introduce in addition a coupling of the "inflaton" to Gauss-Bonnet gravitational term. The latter leads to the following radical change of the form of the total effective "inflaton" potential: its flat regions are now converted into a local maximum corresponding to a "hill-top" inflation in the "early" universe with no spontaneous breakdown of electroweak gauge symmetry and, correspondigly, into a local minimum corresponding to the "late" universe evolution with a very small value of the dark energy and with operating Higgs mechanism.

40|$|Synapsin I (formerly {{referred}} to as protein I) is the collective name for two almost identical phosphoproteins, synapsin Ia and synapsin Ib (protein Ia and protein Ib), present in the nervous system. Synapsin I has previously been shown by immunoperoxidase studies (De Camilli, P., T. Ueda, F. E. Bloom, E. Battenberg, and P. Greengard, 1979, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 76 : 5977 - 5981; Bloom, F. E., T. Ueda, E. Battenberg, and P. Greengard, 1979, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 76 : 5982 - 5986) to be a neuron-specific protein, present in both the central and peripheral nervous systems and concentrated in the synaptic region of nerve cells. In those preliminary studies, the occurrence of synapsin I could be demonstrated in {{only a portion of}} synapses. We have now carried out a detailed examination of the distribution of synapsin I immunoreactivity in the central and peripheral nervous systems. In this study we have attempted to maximize the level of resolution of immunohistochemical light microscopy images in order to estimate the proportion of immunoreactive synapses and to establish their precise distribution. Optimal results were obtained by the use of immunofluorescence in semithin sections (approximately 1 micron) prepared from Epon-embedded nonosmicated tissues after the Epon had been removed. Our results confirm the previous observations on the specific localization of synapsin I in nerve cells and synapses. In addition, the results strongly suggest that, with a few possible exceptions involving highly specialized neurons, all synapses contain synapsin I. Finally, immunocytochemical experiments indicate that synapsin <b>I</b> <b>appearance</b> in the various regions of the developing nervous system correlates topographically and temporally with the appearance of synapses. In two accompanying papers (De Camilli, P., S. M. Harris, Jr., W. B. Huttner, and P. Greengard, and Huttner, W. B., W. Schiebler, P. Greengard, and P. De Camilli, 1983, J.

40|$|Sloping {{sides of}} natural basins favour the {{formation}} of cross-shore temperature gradients (differential coastal heating/cooling), which cause significant littoral-pelagial water exchange. Autumnal denser water cascading along a sloping lake boundary, modulated by day/night variations of solar heating is considered numerically, in order to reveal {{the development of the}} cascading process in time, spatial structure of the exchange flows, and diurnal variations of volumetric flow-rate of littoral-pelagial exchange flow, as well as to compare its daily maxima at different depths/cross-sections, with known quasi-steady state predictions under constant buoyancy flux. The development of exchange flows progress through two phases: <b>i)</b> <b>appearance</b> and adjustment to day/night buoyancy flux variations; and ii) quasi-steady exchange, when variations of the flow rate in every next diurnal cycle are {{more or less the same}} as the previous day. The duration of the first phase depends on local depth (~ 1 day for depths of about 10 m, ~ 2 days for depths 15 - 25 m, and ~ 5 days down to 30 m for the considered initial linear vertical temperature stratification). Maximum horizontal exchange takes place in the cross-section where the thermocline meets the slope, and the cold down-slope currents detach from the bottom. The location of this cross-section advances off-shore with time, in accordance with the deepening of the upper mixed layer. The existence of a specific coastal circulation cell, with different water dynamics from those above the main part of the slope, is a characteristic feature of horizontal convective exchange. The mean value of the specific volumetric flow rate of the convective exchange, driven by day/night oscillations in its fully developed quasi-steady phase increases almost linearly with local depth, and is about twice as large as the quasi-steady exchange values, predicted by formula Q = 0. 0013 · d 1. 37 (Q is measured in m 2 s - 1, and local depth above the slope d in m), suggesting that the thermal siphon, energized by oscillating day/night buoyancy fluxes, flushes coastal regions twice as efficiently as the cascading, developing under (more or less) uniform external conditions in field observations and laboratory experiments, which lie behind the given formula. Flushing time in the considered case has an order of 10 - 60 hours for a littoral zone of 6 - 30 m depth. Application of convective phase diagrams (e. g., Q vs ΔT) is suggested as a convenient way to describe the day/night convective exchange, allowing for visualization of the flow development process, its coherency and the time lag of the development at different depths...|$|E
