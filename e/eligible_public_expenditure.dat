The paper discusses PEM systems in developing countries using an analytical framework based on principal-agent theory.

To illustrate this, we analyze the benefits derived from the use by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) of two control instruments; ex post audits and ex ante controls, and assess their value in terms of their ability to deter cheating. We derive a set of possible "control regimes" which can be used by the MoF. Although we illustrate the use of the model using developing countries, it is also relevant to developed economies.

The observed faulty allocations of <b>public</b> <b>expenditures,</b> coupled with weaknesses in the budgetary process suggest major potential gains for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> program in ANRE. These areas of reform relate to whether: (a) <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> are being used to perform/provide public roles/goods vs. private ones; (b) choice of policy instruments (i. e., expenditure program vs. other market-based instruments) is most cost-effective; (c) <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> are optimally allocated across policy instruments, agencies and levels of government, regions, and type of expenditures; (d) mechanisms for funding and other related budgetary procedures promote efficient and effective allocation of public expenditures; and (e) cost-effective mechanisms for timely monitoring, evaluation, and impact analysis of <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> are adopted. The study finds that a thorough analysis, monitoring and evaluation of expenditure programs are therefore crucial in ensuring that policy objectives are attained though efficient and effective public resource allocation.

This paper examines the methodological issues in assigning <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> to countries and regions, and reviews existing and past patterns of <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> in English regions. It then considers the relevance of this analysis to policy options for introducing an explicit regional dimension to the <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> allocation mechanism in England. Paradoxically, English regional devolution is potentially more radical in its implications, in terms of rupturing existing allocative mechanisms that lead to flows of expenditure, than devolution in the territories (where it can be interpreted as putting democratic caps on pre-existing bureaucratic bodies) ...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} is to critically analyze the Trends of <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> growth on infrastructure in Nigeria, using available time series data from 1970 to 2006. The specific objective of the study with an overriding aim of providing policy-relevant evidence are: to examine the trend in <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> on infrastructure in Nigeria between 1970 to 2006; to compare the trend in <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> between the military and democratic government in Nigeria between 1970 to 2006; to determine the relationship between expenditure on infrastructure and long-run economic growth; ascertain the factors that influence <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> growth {{in infrastructure}}; test for the stability of growth in <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> on infrastructure over time and derive policy recommendations based on the findings of the study. The model specification is based on the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) multiple regression while the estimation procedures is that of the Johansen Maximum Likelihood (JML) and OLS estimators...|$|R

This study finds a unidirectional causality (except for total government expenditure) from economic growth to disaggregated <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> that total current, investment, transfer <b>expenditures,</b> non-transfer total <b>public</b> <b>expenditures</b> in the long run. Although {{the results of this study}} do not support the existence of any long run casual relationship between economic growth and total <b>public</b> <b>expenditures,</b> they do support the existence of long run relationship between economic growth and the disaggregated <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> variables. The result of this study provide evidence to support the proposition in the literature that causality runs from economic growth to disaggregated <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> called as Wagner hypothesis.

40|$|In general, {{transitional}} {{countries have}} the {{higher level of}} factor of production unemployment, significantly under the level of full employment. According to the economic theory and historical experiences of today developed countries, the appropriate economic policy for transitional countries should be Keynesianism, where the fiscal policy, i. e. <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> policy has the key role. The <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> efficiency, as the instrument of economic policy is determined by two effects: crowding out and crowding in effects. If the <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> has the positive influence on private expenditure (personal expenditure and private investments), {{it is the case}} of crowding in effect. But, if the <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> has negative influence on private expenditure, it is the case of crowding out effect. The subject of this paper is the analysis of the determinants of <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> effects in the case of transitional countries. The paper gives the theoretical analysis of crowding out and crowding in effects which depend of <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> structure, sources of financing and existing economic situation. After that, it will be explained by the empirical analysis of possible <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> effects in electric-power system in Bosnia and Herzegovina...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse the {{linkages}} between <b>public</b> <b>expenditure,</b> the components of <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> and economic growth in Turkish economy. Building on the Barro’s (1990) endogenous growth model, ARDL bound test and VAR Granger Causality/Block Exogeneity Wald Test approaches are adopted as econometric tools over the period of 1960 - 2009 for Turkey. The empirical results support Wagner hypothesis for the relationship between economic growth and <b>public</b> <b>expenditure.</b> However, the direction of causality is understood to change when disaggregated accounts of <b>public</b> <b>expenditure</b> with respect to economic categories are included in our analysis...|$|R
