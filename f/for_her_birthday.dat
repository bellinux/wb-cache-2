500|$|Ferb was devised as a {{character}} devoid of ill will. Marsh explained, [...] "It was important to us that [...] never did anything with any animosity. They never tried to get their sister in trouble or outsmart their mother {{and get away with}} it." [...] Instead, he and his brother create things for the sheer enjoyment of it or to help out others ("and for the ladies"); for example, Ferb and Phineas carve Candace's face into Mount Rushmore <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>birthday,</b> set up a roller derby for a rematch race with his Grandmother Betty Jo's old rival, create a haunted house for their friend Isabella to cure her hiccups and make a super-computer to find out what to do for their mom after being so kind to them.|$|E
500|$|Growing up, Perry and her {{siblings}} {{were not allowed}} to eat the cereal Lucky Charms as the term [...] "luck" [...] reminded their mother of Lucifer, and had to call deviled eggs [...] "angeled eggs". Perry primarily listened to gospel music, as secular music was generally discouraged in the family's home. She discovered popular music through CDs she sneaked from her friends. While not strictly identifying as religious, Perry has stated, [...] "I pray all the time– for self-control, for humility." [...] Following her sister Angela, Perry began singing by practicing with her sister's cassette tapes. She performed the tracks in front of their parents, who suggested she take vocal lessons. She began training at age 9, and was incorporated into her parents' ministry, singing in church from ages 9 to 17. At 13, Perry was given her first guitar <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>birthday,</b> and publicly performed songs she wrote. She tried to [...] "be a bit like the typical Californian girl" [...] while growing up, and started rollerskating, skateboarding, and surfing as a teenager. David described her as a tomboy during her adolescence. She took dancing lessons and learned how to swing, Lindy Hop, and jitterbug.|$|E
500|$|Lindblom {{found his}} task of {{translating}} an [...] "outsider's {{view of the}} U.S." [...] for an American audience {{the hardest part of}} the localization. Nintendo did not want a direct translation, but a more American version of the script. He recalled that he was given latitude to make the script [...] "as weird as [...] wanted" [...] but also sought to stay true to the original text's translation, though he never communicated with Shigesato Itoi (the game's creator) directly. Lindblom's own humor and office in-jokes worked their way into the script alongside cultural allusions to Bugs Bunny, comedian Benny Hill, and This Is Spinal Tap. Outside the game's script, Lindblom's in-game text includes the item and weapon names as well as the combat prompts. His writing contains multiple Easter eggs, such as in some of the character's names. One character is named for his daughter, Nico, who was born during development. After taking the day off <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>birthday,</b> Lindblom recalled working for the next 30 days straight, without weekends off. He remembered the workload as large, and recalled [...] "grinding-out" [...] for about 14 hours a day. The localization process took four months.|$|E

Peter then urges Meg to hold them, and then asks if his long johns are tied to the end of them. When Meg says they are not, Peter then says [...] "Oh, god" [...] and regurgitates them as well, and then crouches in pain following the ordeal. Meg asks Lois if she can open her gifts, and Meg notices Stewie opening most of them.

500|$|The creators wanted Phineas, like Ferb, to be a {{character}} who would never [...] " [...] anything with any ," [...] or to agitate his sister or outsmart his mother purposely. Instead, the character {{was supposed to be}} motivated only by enjoyment and free from mean spiritedness. He is generous, kind, and optimistic, and several of his plots involve helping someone out. He tries to please his sister Candace, carving her face into Mount Rushmore <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>birthday</b> in one episode and helping her retrieve a tape detailing his summer adventures even though she intended on using the footage as evidence to [...] "bust" [...] him and Ferb. Another episode has him throwing an extravaganza for his mother's birthday, and yet another has him (along with Ferb and Candace) recreating their parent's most romantic moment for their wedding anniversary. He has also been shown helping his grandparents, reenacting his grandfather Reginald's daredevil stunt from his youth and setting up a roller derby for a rematch race with his grandmother Betty Jo's old rival. In the episodes [...] "One Good Scare Ought to Do It!" [...] and [...] "Hail Doofania!", Phineas goes to great lengths to help his friend Isabella. [...] Other episodes, like [...] "Unfair Science Fair," [...] "Oil on Candace," [...] "The Bully Code," [...] and [...] "Voyage To The Bottom of Buford," [...] further explore Phineas's generosity toward all of his friends.

500|$|On December 8, 2011, Minaj tweeted {{that she}} was on set with Madonna filming the music video for [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin".

A legend! said she'd have me, I said ill have her too". Directed by the team Megaforce—which {{consists}} of Léo Berne, Charles Brisgand, Raphaël Rodriguez and Clément Gallet—the video has a football and cheerleader theme, inspired by her then-upcoming Super Bowl halftime performance. Rodriguez explained to MTV News that they discussed the song with Solveig and understood that the video should be [...] "about happiness and something really sunny". The whole look was also dictated by the fact that Megaforce had never collaborated with Madonna, Minaj and M.I.A., feeling that it was a [...] "different universe" [...] for them. The video was shot for over two days in New York, with very strict timings which Megaforce found as challenging. Describing the process as like working with the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), Megaforce told Swedish newspaper 20 minutes that the set was surrounded by police patrol and security guards and mobile phones were not allowed. A total budget of US$1.5 million was allotted for the video. Some of the sequences in the video was Madonna's idea like one scene featuring her dancing in front of a wall, which Megaforce felt would not go with the main narrative. However, the singer insisted on keeping it and by the second day of filming she wrapped up early and left.|$|E
