5|$|HDR {{brachytherapy}} for nonmelanomatous skin cancer, such as {{basal cell}} carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, provides an alternative treatment option to surgery. This is especially relevant for cancers on the nose, ears, eyelids or lips, where surgery may cause <b>disfigurement</b> or require extensive reconstruction. Various applicators {{can be used to}} ensure close contact between the radiation source(s) and the skin, which conform to the curvature of the skin and help ensure precision delivery of the optimal irradiation dose.|$|E

40|$|Scarring {{resulting}} from entanglement in fishing gear {{can be used}} to examine cetacean fishery interactions. False killer whales (Pseudorca crassidens) are known to interact with the Hawai'i-based tuna and swordfish long-line fishery in offshore Hawaiian waters. We examined the rate of major dorsal fin <b>disfigurements</b> of false killer whales from nearshore waters around the main Hawaiian Islands to assess the likelihood that individuals around the main islands are part of the same population that interacts with the fishery. False killer whales were encountered on 11 occasions between 2000 and 2004, and 80 distinctive individuals were photographically documented. Three of these (3. 75 %) had major dorsal fin <b>disfigurements</b> (two with the fins completely bent over and one missing the fin). Information from other research suggests that the rate of such <b>disfigurements</b> for our study population may be more than four times greater than for other odontocete populations. We suggest that the most likely cause of such <b>disfigurements</b> is interactions with longlines and that false killer whales found in nearshore waters around the main Hawaiian Islands are part of the same population that interacts with the fishery. Two of the animals documented with <b>disfigurements</b> had infants in close attendance and were thought to be adult females. This implies that even with such injuries, at least some females may be able to produce offspring, despite the importance of the dorsal fin in reproductive thermoregulation...|$|R

5|$|Following Christiane's funeral, Dr. Génessier and his {{assistant}} Louise, {{the woman who had}} disposed of the dead body earlier, return home where the real Christiane is hidden (it is explained that Louise is deathlessly loyal to Génessier because he repaired her own badly damaged face, leaving only a barely noticeable scar she covers with a pearl choker). The body belonged to a young woman who died following Dr. Génessier's unsuccessful attempt to graft her face onto his daughter's. Dr. Génessier promises to restore Christiane's face and insists that she wear a mask to cover her <b>disfigurement.</b> After her father leaves the room, Christiane calls her fiancé Jacques Vernon, who works with Dr. Génessier at his clinic, but hangs up without saying a word.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Creeper {{goes to a}} pawn {{store to}} buy a brooch for Helen, and kills the {{pawnbroker}} (Charles Wagenheim) following a fight. He later brings the brooch to Helen, who he realizes {{for the first time}} is blind. Hal learns she needs $3,000 for surgery that would restore her eyesight. When Helen tries to touch his face, Hal angrily storms out. He then goes to the Scott residence and demands money from Clifford and Virginia, whom he blames for his <b>disfigurement.</b> Clifford draws a gun and shoots Hal twice in the stomach, but the weakened Hal manages to strangle Clifford to death before escaping with Virginia's jewels. He brings them to Helen, who is concerned about Hal's injuries, but he flees before she can learn he is shot.|$|E
5|$|Merrick was now {{homeless}} on {{the streets}} of Leicester. His uncle, a barber named Charles Merrick, heard of his nephew's situation, sought him out and offered him accommodation in his home. Merrick continued to hawk around Leicester {{for the next two years}} but his efforts to earn a living met with little more success than before. Eventually, his <b>disfigurement</b> drew such negative attention from members of the public that the Commissioners for Hackney Carriages withdrew his licence when it came up for renewal. With young children to provide for, Charles could no longer afford to support his nephew. In late December 1879, now 17 years old, Merrick entered the Leicester Union Workhouse.|$|E

40|$|WOMEN WITH FACIAL DISFIGUREMENTS: IMPACT OF MEDIA-CONSTRUCTED IMAGES OF BEAUTY by Sophia M.

A qualitative study was conducted through in-depth telephone interviews with 25 women with various facial <b>disfigurements.</b> The study showed that, although media-constructed images of beauty did have some influence on the participants 2 ̆ 7 overall perceptions of self, other factors such as the manner in which the participants were treated, their own personal insecurities about their appearance, and their life-experiences growing up and living with facial <b>disfigurements</b> were found to have had a greater influence on their self-esteem, self-worth, and overall perceptions of self...|$|R

5|$|A mysterious {{recruiter}} approaches Wilson, {{offering an}} experimental cure for his cancer. He {{is taken to}} Ajax and Angel Dust, who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent mutant genes. They then subject him to days of torture to induce stress to trigger any mutation Wade may have, but without success. Wilson discovers Ajax's real name, Francis, and mocks him for it. In response, Ajax leaves Wilson in a hyperbaric chamber that takes him to the verge of asphyxiation periodically over a weekend. It finally activates a superhuman healing ability that cures his cancer, but leaves him severely disfigured with burn-like scars over his entire body. He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax, but relents when told that his <b>disfigurement</b> can be cured. Ajax subdues Wilson and leaves him for dead in the burning laboratory.|$|E
5|$|In his {{comic book}} appearances, the Joker {{is portrayed as}} a {{criminal}} mastermind. Introduced as a psychopath with a warped, sadistic sense of humor, the character became a goofy prankster in the late 1950s in response to regulation by the Comics Code Authority, before returning to his darker roots during the early 1970s. As Batman's nemesis, the Joker {{has been part of}} the superhero's defining stories, including the murder of Jason Todd—the second Robin and Batman's ward—and the paralysis of one of Batman's allies, Barbara Gordon. The Joker has had various possible origin stories during his decades of appearances. The most common story involves him falling into a tank of chemical waste which bleaches his skin white, turns his hair green, and his lips bright red; the resulting <b>disfigurement</b> drives him insane. The antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance, the Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary.|$|E

Moore flew to be by Goldstein's side in hospital, and the media reported that they were dating again. He was released on September 26, 2008, and was expected to make a full recovery. In December 2008, Goldstein filed a civil lawsuit against the plane's charter company, Learjet and Goodyear tires; the suit claimed negligence {{on the part of the}} pilots, and a manufacturing defect on part of the plane. He asked for damages for pain and suffering, mental anguish, <b>disfigurement</b> and loss of earnings. The lawsuit was settled by his estate in 2010, a year after his death.|$|E

Riker defeats the attacking ships and the Enterprise escapes. Their plan exposed, Ru'afo insists upon harvesting the radiation source immediately. Picard, Anij, and several Ba'ku are transported as prisoners onto the Son'a ship. Picard reveals to Dougherty that the Son'a and the Ba'ku are the same race and involving the Federation in a blood feud.
