5|$|Announced on 6 May 1997, {{only five}} days after that year's General Election, and officially given {{operational}} responsibility for setting <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>in</b> the Bank of England Act 1998, the Committee {{was designed to be}} independent of political interference and thus to add credibility to interest rate decisions. Each member has one vote, for which they are held to account: full minutes of each meeting are published alongside the Committee's monetary policy decisions, and members are regularly called before the Treasury Select Committee, as well as speaking to wider audiences at events during the year.|$|E
5|$|When the no-arbitrage {{condition}} is {{satisfied with the}} use of a forward contract to hedge against exposure to exchange rate risk, interest rate parity is said to be covered. Investors will still be indifferent among the available <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>in</b> two countries because the forward exchange rate sustains equilibrium such that the dollar return on dollar deposits is equal to the dollar return on foreign deposit, thereby eliminating the potential for covered interest arbitrage profits. Furthermore, covered interest rate parity helps explain the determination of the forward exchange rate. The following equation represents covered interest rate parity.|$|E
5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their currency {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing quantitative easing, the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that the currency will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>in</b> countries not practising quantitative easing. This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in the currency of the country practising quantitative easing, and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling the currency being used for quantitative easing on the international markets, this can increase the supply of the currency and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{aimed at}} investigating the role, impact and determinants of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> Jordanian economy from view points of banking managers in Jordan. The methodology is descriptive and analytical using mean, standard deviation, t-test and percentages as statistical tools. The {{study concluded that}} the role of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> Jordanian monetary policy is restricted by two factors: pegging JD with US$ which limits the effective role of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> Jordanian monetary policy and the dual banking system of traditional and Islamic banks where Islamic banks do not deal with <b>Interest</b> <b>rate.</b> Raising <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> Jordan caused higher cost of credit for companies, less competitiveness of exports, less liquidity in the economy, higher profit margin for banks, higher exchange rate of JD and higher inflation. Nevertheless, lowering <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> Jordan caused lower cost of borrowing, higher liquidity, better competitiveness of exports and more credit facilities by banks but inflation was much lower. Moreover, the study concluded the determinants of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> Jordan are money supply, demand for money, inflation and economic conditions. In order to have an effective role for <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> monetary policy, the researcher recommends pegging JD to a basket of currencies...|$|R
40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} {{existence}} of fisher effect in Nigeria. Specifically, it seeks to: {{examine the relationship between}} expected inflation and nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> Nigeria; and also determine the nature and direction of causality between expected inflation and nominal <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> Nigeria. Employing Cointegration, Granger causality and error correction techniques and using data spanning the period of 1970 - 2011, the results indicate {{the existence of}} long run partial fisher effect in Nigeria. Specifically, there exists a long run positive and significant relationship between inflation and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> Nigeria. Furthermore, there exists a unidirectional causality running from inflation to <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> Nigeria. The paper recommends amongst others that, given the crucial role of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> determining savings and investment which are necessary for economic growth and development, policy makers and relevant monetary authorities should employ measures that will prevent inflation rate from rising to alarming heights {{in order to ensure that}} <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> are maintained at reasonably low levels in Nigeria...|$|R

5|$|On 6 September 2012, the ECB {{announced}} to offer additional financial {{support in the}} form of some yield-lowering bond purchases (OMT), for all eurozone countries involved in a sovereign state bailout program from EFSF/ESM. A eurozone country can benefit from the program if -and for as long as- it is found to suffer from stressed bond yields at excessive levels; but only at the point of time where the country possesses/regains a complete market access -and only if the country still complies with all terms in the signed Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) agreement. Countries receiving a precautionary programme rather than a sovereign bailout will, by definition, have complete market access and thus qualify for OMT support if also suffering from stressed interest rates on its government bonds. In regards of countries receiving a sovereign bailout (Ireland, Portugal and Greece), they will on the other hand not qualify for OMT support before they have regained complete market access, which will normally only happen after having received the last scheduled bailout disbursement. Despite none OMT programmes were ready to start in September/October, the financial markets straight away took notice of the additionally planned OMT packages from ECB, and started slowly to price-in a decline of both short-term and long-term <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>in</b> all European countries previously suffering from stressed and elevated interest levels (as OMTs were regarded as an extra potential back-stop to counter the frozen liquidity and highly stressed rates; and just the knowledge about their potential existence {{in the very near future}} helped to calm the markets).|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the behavior of}} the long-term <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> Poland based on a sample during 2001. Q 1 – 2009. Q 1. Both the demand for and supply of loanable funds are considered. Extending the openeconomy loanable funds model, this paper finds thatmore government debt as a percent of gdp leads to a higher long-term <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> Poland and that a higher real Treasury bill rate, more percent change in real GDP, a higher expected inflation rate, a higher world long-term <b>interest</b> <b>rate,</b> and depreciation of the zloty would increase the long-term <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>in</b> Poland. In the standard open-economy loanable funds model including the net capital inflow, the coefficient of the net capital inflow is positive and insignificant at the 10 % level.

25|$|During the 1980 recession, {{manufacturing}} shed 1.1million jobs, while {{service industries}} remained intact. Employment in automotive manufacturing in particular suffered, experiencing a 33% reduction {{by the end}} of the recession. Collectively these factors contributed to the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980. The Federal Reserve once again began to raise <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>in</b> 1981, which plunged the economy back into recession. Unemployment rose to a peak of 10.8% in December 1982, a post-war high.|$|E
25|$|In the 1990s, bank <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>in</b> Japan {{were near}} zero for an {{extended}} period of time. To search for higher yields from these low rates in bank deposits, investors used money market funds for short-term deposits instead. However, several money market funds fell off short of their stable value in 2001 due to the bankruptcy of Enron, in which several Japanese funds had invested, and investors fled into government-insured bank accounts. Since then the total value of money markets have remained low.|$|E

25|$|The gold {{standard}} {{was the primary}} transmission mechanism of the Great Depression. Even countries that did not face bank failures and a monetary contraction first hand were forced to join the deflationary policy since higher <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>in</b> countries that performed a deflationary policy led to a gold outflow in countries with lower interest rates.

The 1973 oil crisis caused recession and high <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>in</b> the West, to which the Polish government had to respond with sharp domestic consumer price increases.

25|$|Fisher's main {{intellectual}} rival was the Swedish economist Knut Wicksell. Fisher espoused a more succinct {{explanation of}} the quantity theory of money, resting it almost exclusively on long run prices. Wicksell's theory was considerably more complicated, beginning with <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>in</b> a system {{of changes in the}} real economy. Although both economists concluded from their theories that {{at the heart of the}} business cycle (and economic crisis) was government monetary policy, their disagreement would not be solved in their lifetimes, and indeed, it was inherited by the policy debates between the Keynesians and monetarists beginning a half-century later.|$|E
25|$|The {{causes of}} the Great Recession seem similar to the Great Depression, but {{significant}} differences exist. The previous chairman of the Federal Reserve, Ben Bernanke, had extensively studied the Great Depression {{as part of his}} doctoral work at MIT, and implemented policies to manipulate the money supply and <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>in</b> ways that were not done in the 1930s. Bernanke's policies will undoubtedly be analyzed and scrutinized in the years to come, as economists debate the wisdom of his choices. Generally speaking, the recovery of the world's financial systems tended to be quicker during the Great Depression of the 1930s as opposed to the late-2000s recession.|$|E
25|$|Deflation in Japan {{started in}} the early 1990s. On 19 March 2001, the Bank of Japan and the Japanese {{government}} tried to eliminate deflation in the economy by reducing interest rates (part of their 'quantitative easing' policy). Despite having interest rates near zero for a long period, this strategy did not succeed. Once the near-zero interest rates failed to stop deflation, some economists, such as Paul Krugman, and some Japanese politicians spoke of deliberately causing (or at least creating the fear of) inflation. In July 2006, the zero-rate policy was ended. In 2008, the Japanese Central Bank still had the lowest <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>in</b> the developed world and deflation continued.|$|E

25|$|During the Great Depression, {{every major}} {{currency}} abandoned {{the gold standard}}. Among the earliest, the Bank of England abandoned the gold standard in 1931 as speculators demanded gold in exchange for currency, threatening the solvency of the British monetary system. This pattern repeated throughout Europe and North America. In the United States, the Federal Reserve was forced to raise <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> <b>in</b> {{order to protect the}} gold standard for the US dollar, worsening already severe domestic economic pressures. After bank runs became more pronounced in early 1933, people began to hoard gold coins as distrust for banks led to distrust for paper money, worsening deflation and depleting gold reserves.|$|E
