40|$|The {{impact of}} varied calving and weaning times on {{post-weaning}} production of steer calves was evaluated in a 3 - yr study. Steers (approximately 12 steers per calving-weaning treatment per year) born {{in late winter}} or early spring were weaned at 190 or 240 d of age, and steers born in late spring were weaned at 140 or 190 d of age after grazing with their dams on native range. Steers were pen-fed a growing diet until approximately 375 kg BW. They were then moved to an individual feeding facility and fed a higher-energy diet. Steers were allotted to harvest dates based upon visual estimates of <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> <b>cover.</b> Mixed model procedures were used to evaluate fixed effects of treatment and random effects of year and year × treatment. Predefined contrasts were used to delineate treatment effects. Initial steer BW was affected by calving system and age at weaning. No treatment differences in ADG during the growing phase or ADG, feed intake, or feed efficiency during the finishing phase occurred. Steers averaged 537 ± 4 kg at harvest and age at harvest did not differ among treatments. Late winter steers had greater hot carcass weights, marbling scores, and quality grades than early spring steers. Calving later in the calendar year without altering weaning times produced younger calves at weaning with lighter BW {{at the start of}} the feeding period, which required greater number of days from weaning to harvest and produced carcasses with less marbling and lesser quality grades...|$|E

Finally, evaluate the effect weight was 266 bulls for carcass quality, the average slaughter weight amounted to 715, 4 kg. As an indicator was chosen carcase weight, which amounted an average of 401, 9 kg. Furthermore, the average daily gain these monitored bulls amounted 0, 985 kg, and the average age at slaughter was 23 months.

40|$|Appearance {{characteristics}} {{are thought to}} be the main factors governing consumer choice of pork and principally comprise colour, amount <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> <b>cover,</b> marbling and drip. Preferences for pork characteristics have been determined separately in different countries in several local studies, but the practical limitations imposed by the short display-life of meats, make it inevitable that the people in different localities have assessed different meats. The meats also will have differed simultaneously in several of the above characteristics and the relative importance of those characteristics is uncertain. The conclusions from such studies are therefore limited when considering cultural and international dimensions. These limitations, particularly so when surveying large numbers of people in different countries, have been overcome by using photographs varying systematically in four appearance characteristics. This approach is the first time a large scale systematic study has been conducted on meat appearance and consumer preference.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} current {{imbalance}} between available donor livers and patients {{waiting for a}} new liver graft, suboptimal donor livers are increasingly accepted for liver transplantation. Examples of suboptimal donor livers are livers derived from elderly donors or donors with a fatty liver due to overweight. Unfortunately, these suboptimal donor livers are more prone {{for the period of}} ischemia, which occurs when the donor liver is transported between the donation and transplantation hospital. Because of this higher vulnerability for ischemia, suboptimal donor livers are related to a higher <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> tissue injury and subsequently poorer postoperative outcomes. The subject of Andrie Westerkamp’s PhD thesis was to examine different strategies to improve the outcome after transplantation of suboptimal donor livers.

40|$|A {{total of}} 13, 315 beef calves fed at eight Iowa feedyards {{were used to}} {{evaluate}} the effect of disposition during the feedlot period on feedlot gain and carcass quality. The calves, representing 12 states, were consigned to the Iowa Tri-County Steer Carcass Futurity and were weighed upon arrival, after 35 days, at reimplant, and prior to harvest. A disposition score (Beef Improvement Federation Six Point Scoring System – 1 = very docile and 6 = very aggressive) was assigned at on test weighing, re-implant time, and pre-harvest, and these disposition scores were averaged to calculate a mean disposition score. The mean disposition score was used to classify calves into three groups for analysis – 1 and 2 = docile (n= 9, 642), 3 and 4 = restless (n= 2, 915), and 5 and 6 = aggressive (n= 758). A common diet and health program was utilized at each feedlot. Calves were sorted and harvested when they were visually evaluated to have 0. 4 inches <b>of</b> <b>fat</b> <b>cover.</b> Arrival weight (lb) and ADG (lb/day) were 630. 5 and 3. 17; 626. 4 and 3. 11; and 610. 8 and 2. 91 for docile, restless, and aggressive calves, respectively. Morbidity rate was significantly (P=. 0009) affected by disposition class 19. 23, 16. 82 and 16. 18...|$|R
