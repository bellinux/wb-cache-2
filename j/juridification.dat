40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{doctoral}} thesis is to study and conceptualize <b>juridification</b> as a phenomenon. This aim comprises analyzing the theories through which <b>juridification</b> as an empirical development is interpreted. In this thesis <b>juridification</b> signifies displacements towards legal discourse. <b>Juridification</b> comes about when an issue that was previously dealt with within a cultural, ethical, political, economical, or {{some other kind of}} discourse, begins to be, or to be more clearly or more often, treated as a legal matter. <b>Juridification</b> implies that discussions in some area of social life or discussions about a particular issue become, or become more often or more clearly, conducted through legal arguments and counter-arguments. In this thesis <b>juridification</b> also designates two processes that are closely related to displacements towards legal discourse. Through the first process a statute addresses a situation or an aspect of social life that was formerly not touched upon by laws or other statutes. Through the second a situation or an aspect of social life, which was previously not an object of judicial judgment or decision-making, becomes such an object. In order to make the phenomenon of <b>juridification</b> tangible the thesis works with a case of <b>juridification,</b> namely the <b>juridification</b> of the position of the patient in publicly financed healthcare...|$|E

40|$|The <b>juridification</b> {{of social}} spheres {{appears as a}} disquieting modern trend in several {{different}} national cultures. Although the large variety of national experiences with <b>juridification</b> cannot be summarized in a unifying formula, {{it is important to}} note that <b>juridification</b> is not to be understood primarily as a quantitative phenomenon of the growth of law and regulation. Rather, it has to be seen in its qualitative dimensions, that is, as the emergence of new structures of law to keep pace with the growth of the welfare state. To the degree that the law is used for the regulatory and compensatory purposes of the welfare state, extensive changes in the structure and function of law are involved. In addition, recent trends of crisis in regulatory law seem to be closely connected to the more general crisis of the welfare state. One fascinating aspect of the debate on the crisis of the welfare state and the law is the emergence not only of the concepts of delegalization and deregulation but also of alternatives to delegalization, that is, of forms of legal discourse which avoid certain fallacies of regulatory law without abandoning the idea of an active role of law in shaping social institutions. The modern phenomenon of <b>juridification</b> was the central theme of a larger research project which Terence Daintith and I conducted at the European University Institute in Florence. The results of this project were presented in March 1985 at a conference on "Law and Economic Policy: Alternatives to De-Legalization". The contributions with an economic policy orientation are to be published separately in a volume on "Law as an Instrument of Economic Policy" edited by Terence Daintith; this volume instead concentrates on <b>juridification</b> in the fields of labor, industrial organization, antitrust and social security.

Increased {{regulation}} by law, specification {{of laws and}} individual legal entitlements {{has been described as}} processes of <b>juridification.</b> In Sweden this is evident in how student rights have become more prominent in governing education. In this article, I explore aspects of <b>juridification</b> that apply to student rights. I argue that <b>juridification</b> and the practice of parental and student choice of schools and education are interlinked, and they emphasise and strengthen an understanding of education as a 'private good', where rights' violations should be solved with reference to law and judicial procedures. I do this by analysing two cases of student appeals in education. The two cases show prevalence of a rights discourse that benefit privileged rather than marginalised groups. Students are positioned as rights-holding consumers constructing a tension between the right to school choice and the right not to be harassed...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{identifies}} {{a number}} of weaknesses and omissions {{in the literature on}} <b>juridification</b> and responds in four main ways. Firstly, it introduces and defends an empirical definition of <b>juridification</b> as the governance of political or regulatory relationships by law and legal considerations. Secondly, it proposes and utilises a method of testing <b>juridification,</b> through a qualitative approach to indicators, and explores the utility of these indicators. Thirdly, it seeks to understand, through an examination of two case studies (the Commission for Racial Equality and the Office of Fair Trading) why <b>juridification</b> sometimes occurs and sometimes fails to occur. Fourthly, it explores the implications of the findings for the literature dealing with regulatory strategy. It is argued that the evidence of the case studies generally supports the regulatory strategy literature. Relationships between the regulatory agencies and their regulatees were generally characterised by informal contacts, with law remaining principally in the background. This general lack of <b>juridification</b> was, moreover, caused by the factors emphasised in the literature on regulatory strategies. However, this general support to the regulatory strategy literature is qualified by two exceptions - both areas of regulation which have been substantially affected by EC law. The exceptions suggest firstly that there may be cases in which <b>juridification</b> can occur despite a persuasive regulatory strategy, and secondly that persuasive regulatory strategy is not always the predominant strategy. The literature on regulatory strategies may thus require some revision...|$|E
40|$|This article {{takes as}} its point of {{departure}} the notion of <b>juridification</b> in sport and, in particular, the perspective that the term has previously often been used in sport and law literature in a too narrow and limiting sense. Using the work of Ken Foster as a platform, the article examines a more nuanced notion of <b>juridification.</b> It does this by first unpacking two levels of <b>juridification</b> – the more well-known notion of increased legal intervention is considered {{before moving on to}} a more sophisticated application of the idea in terms of its impact upon rules and practices in sport. Foster termed this <b>juridification</b> as domestication. The article then applies these ideas in a practical context by examining two applications of the two children’s sports (rugby and cricket) in England and South Africa. The article concludes as to the future developments that are likely to occur. Despite the economic and cultural differences it seems likely that South Africa will continue to follow England, {{as is the case with}} the first level of <b>juridification,</b> and that the rules and their enforcement will themselves become more domesticated. It is likely that coaches and educators will find themselves under increased pressure to conform from both a general fear of litigation and a changing internal regulatory regime of sport codes...|$|E

40|$|We {{can observe}} an ongoing external, {{as well as}} an internal, <b>juridification</b> of football, which means that the legal system and a legal {{rationality}} has become to an increasingly degree mixed up with football. Whether applying an internal or an external perspective the <b>juridification</b> process and the regulation can be understood as an outcome of the increasing commercialization and professionalization of football. In the wake of the commercialization process various clubs have suffered, and still suffer, from overspendings, in Sweden as well as in other European countries. In this respect, the regulation of football licenses in Sweden, which was introduced in 2001, constitutes the main subject in this essay. The regulation was introduced by the Swedish Football Association, mainly as an internal response to the acceleration of expenses in Swedish football. By focusing on football licenses and their regulation the essay intends to shed light on the 'internal <b>juridification</b> of sport'. And by taking a departure in a socio-legal perspective, the regulation will be connected to a reflection on its impact on the development of football...|$|E

Kratochwil, {{formerly}} EUI/CEU Budapest/Supervisor; Professor Dennis Patterson, EUI, Law Department; Professor IngerJohanne Sand, Univ. Oslo; Professor Jan Klabbers, Univ. Helsinki. Despite law’s many failures, we see {{it being}} deployed everywhere both at the domestic and the international level. This thesis approaches that puzzle and attempts to provide {{a better understanding of}} the role of law in society through the concept of <b>juridification.</b> I conceive the problem of <b>juridification</b> of Western societies in qualitative rather than quantitative/managerial terms. This conceptual strategy allows me to challenge the literature on de-regulation and alternative dispute resolution mechanisms concluding that, contrary to common wisdom, these counter-movements to <b>juridification</b> actually reinforce it. I argue that the coupling between judicial review and the constitutionalisation of rights produced a qualitative change in the role of law that enabled the legal system to supersede the political one. This leads to a lock-in situation where the legal system has the capacity of deciding its own reach, thereby becoming, with qualifications, autopoietic. This historical narrative also shows that, contrary to autopoietic theory, <b>juridification</b> is not a purely legally endogenous process. The expanded role of law in society is not without problems. I show how European case law extended state liability in domestic legal orders replacing the once predominant public-interest justifications by the one size fits all” rights talk. For the same reason, while often heralded as a sign of progress, I demonstrate how a rights-based social order is plagued by practical problems. In particular, I focus on the way in which three projects advanced to solve conflicts of rights / balancing, specification and trumps / hide its fundamental agonistic nature. Finally, I evaluate recent conceptualizations of international <b>juridification.</b> I focus on: (i) the inadequacy of the evolutionary metaphor; (ii) the complications behind importing systems theory to the international level and; and, (iii) the lack of a political community and a shared meaning of what law is...|$|E
40|$|Law without courts’ {{seemed to}} Hugo Grotius an entirely {{coherent}} {{approach to the}} <b>juridification</b> of international relations. The first edition of his Law of War and Peace (1625) reflects an intense commitment to framing claims and rules for conduct outside the state in terms of legal rights and duties, but not to judicialization, even though arbitration between sovereigns was addressed in earlier works he had read, such as Alberico Gentili’s Law of War (1598). Yet in modern times international judicialization – the creation and use of international courts and tribunals – has been not only a significant component of liberal approaches to international order, but for some thinkers an indispensable concomitant of <b>juridification.</b> Section I of this chapter {{provides an overview of}} the waves, and accretion, in the formation of what are now ten basic types of international courts. Section II offers some balance to the tendencies (implicit in the approach taken in Section I) to acclaim each flourishing legal institution as an achievement and to study only what exists, by considering the marked unevenness in the issues, and in the ranges of states, currently subject to <b>juridification</b> through international courts and tribunals. Section III addresses the question whether the density and importance of the judicially-focused <b>juridification</b> that now exists has implications for politics, law, and justice that are truly significant and qualitatively different from what has gone before. This is explored by examining some of the main roles and functions of international courts, considered not simply as a menu but as a complex aggregate. Section IV concludes...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT University: Växjö University, {{school of}} social science, {{department}} of political science Level: Bachelor’s thesis in political science Title: SHIFTING BALANCE OF POWER? – an analyze of the new EU-treaty’s consequences for the EC-court. Academic adviser: Associate professor Stefan Höjelid Author: Magnus Nordahl This study focuses on the increased role of the European Court of Justice through {{the establishment of a}} Constitution for Europe {{and its impact on the}} balance of power, both horizontal and vertical. To do this, the study takes its aims from the research problem, formulated as follows: Does the establishment of a constitution for Europe contribute to an increased role for the European Court of Justice and does it create a more legible horizontal and vertical division of power? To reach the relevant analyses and conclusions two precise questions are presented as well as an analytical model. The precise questions are: • Which are the relevant contributions for the balance of power from a perspective of <b>juridification</b> in the new EU-treaty? • What impacts do those contributions have on the so called ‘European federalism’? The theoretical perspective of this study is rooted in the concept of federalism with special emphasizes on constitution and sovereignty as well as a part about the process of <b>juridification.</b> Along with the presented analytical model consisting of a horizontal and vertical division of power, the empirical material is presented with focus on the new EU-treaty about a constitution for Europe and the European Court of Justice. By doing this, analyses are made about the changing power of the ECJ and the new EU-treaty from a perspective of division of power, federalism and <b>juridification.</b> Through the establishment of the EU-treaty about the creation of a constitution the ECJ receive a clearer platform to act upon which contributes to a more legible division of power, both horizontal and vertical. This due to the fact that the new EU-treaty will take place as the highest law within the EU, something that the ECJ have the right to interpret. The whole process is also a broader recognition of the process of <b>juridification</b> where judicial power increases on the cost of politics.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{military}} law {{has undergone a}} long-term process of change. Previously an autonomous legal system with little civilian input at the administrative, judicial and policy-making levels, military law became subject to a consensual policy of civilianisation from the early 1960 s, reflected primarily in the adoption of civilian criminal law norms by the military justice system. More recently there has emerged the <b>juridification</b> of significant areas of military relations in respect to discipline and certain other terms of service which hitherto have not been subject to externally imposed legal regulation. Explanations for the shifts from autonomy, through civilianisation, and then to <b>juridification,</b> ranging from political and social developments to new human rights and equal opportunities discourses, are offered for such changes...|$|E
40|$|The article {{starts with}} the {{observation}} of an ambivalence inherent {{to the politics of}} <b>juridification.</b> On the one hand, some spheres of the life-world such as the family and the school are often places of exploi-tation, degradation and humiliation and therefore seem to require the implementation of legal pro-tection for their members. At the same time, the demand for rights seems somehow to grasp too little, would be inadequate or even counterproductive. How can this ambivalence be politically dealt with? I first briefly reconstruct Jürgen Habermas ’ concept of <b>juridification.</b> I believe that Habermas works with an image of the family and the school as communicatively constituted and juristically uncompromised milieux,whichproves tobehighly questionable. In a second step I considerAxelHonneth’s theoryof the absolutization of legal freedom as offered in his recent work Freedom’s Right. Honneth sidesteps several problematic implications of the Habermasian thesis of colonization, but still tends to underestimate the dominant patriarchal power relations in the spheres of the family and the school. Finally, I pursue Honneth’s own suggestion that a new notion of politics is required for understanding contemporary struggles for recognition, which overcomes the statist tendencies of liberalism. I therefore propose to shift the perspective on the phenomenon of <b>juridification,</b> viewing it instead {{from the standpoint of the}} agents themselves, by turning to Wendy Brown’s feminist theory on the paradoxes of rights...|$|E

40|$|The paper elaborates on the {{relationship}} between social citizenship and <b>juridification.</b> Departing from a Marshallian understanding of social citizenship, <b>juridification</b> processes concern the institutional construction of social citizenship by combining collective political obligations {{on the one hand and}} individual rights and duties on the other. One important intention of the paper is to elaborate on how social citizenship is constructed in the possible tension field between political, administrative and legal institutions. How does welfare law affect {{the relationship}} between welfare administration/professions and individuals (e. g. social and civil rights) and between law and politics (e. g. social and political rights) ? The institutionalization of social citizenship has to be studied on the basis of different areas of welfare law. This is exemplified by two empirical cases: the legal development in the field of work and welfare on the one hand and health services on the other. In the field of health services it seems reasonable to say that a <b>juridification</b> process has taken place in Norway - implying a reinforcement of individual patients’ rights and thus a strengthening of social citizenship. The expansion of rights within the sector encompasses claims to certain services and through the legislation patients are granted procedural rights and an increased opportunity to decide on questions concerning medical examination and treatment. In the field of social policy individual legal rights to social benefits have increasingly been comprehended as to render people passive, leading to a stronger coupling between individual rights and duties expressed through the establishment of quasi-contractual legal arrangements. It may be argued that contractualism implies de-juridification in the way that it emphasizes tailor-made services and increased local discretion in the preparation of the content of welfare policies (weak legal control) ...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{argues that}} the current global market is {{organized}} by a system of transnational law whose development is best characterized as ambivalent. On the one side, legal <b>juridification</b> {{can lead to a}} hegemonic system of international law that lacks legitimacy, paradoxically creates extralegal spheres, promotes the ‘privatization’ of political areas, and, thereby, reduces the competences of states. On the other side, legal codification can also function as an engine of transnational democratization and as a barrier to an unhampered growth of transnational administrative and executive power. Scholarship on the idea of legitimacy in law and transnational governance in political and legal theory has to reflect these aspects of <b>juridification</b> on a world scale. Most approaches to the issue, however, have serious flaws: they neither offer an adequate empirical diagnosis of the de-embedding of international economic and legal processes, nor do they provide convincing proposals as to how such processes could be domesticated. Against this background, the paper lays out a critical analysis of legal codification processes as well as proposing an account of democratic governance, based on a realistic conception of deliberative democracy...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, I {{explore and}} discuss {{potential}} {{changes in the}} constructions of citizenship and state-individual relationships in Sweden in reference to increased regulation {{and the use of}} formally filed complaints in the Swedish education system. While several studies have examined issues associated with school choice and student influence, few have considered complaints as an aspect of the 'will to empower' and the construction of an active citizenship. In this paper, I discuss the motivations behind providing complaint systems via an analysis of official government documents, laws, statutes, reports and web materials. Drawing from citizenship literature and exit/voice theories, the analysis shows that complaints have continuously been reinforced through legislation, regulation and the introduction of Child and School Student Representative (CSSR) for equal rights and Swedish Schools Inspectorate (SSI) via student rights arguments and rule of law mechanisms. Legal discourse, the expansion of law and an increased use of complaints indicate a <b>juridification</b> of politics. This <b>juridification</b> could reinforce individualised perceptions of citizenship and education as a private good that is inherent in school choice and marketisation. An emphasis on student rights and complaints tends to result in contract relationships between the individual and state that risk de-politicising education and motivations for and participation in collective action for a common good...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} silences: as a metaphysics of the law, <b>juridification</b> silences {{the text of}} the law in order to enable an allegorical reading of the law. This {{silencing}} of the legal text can only be avoided through a non-metaphysical archaeological reading. Similarly, the programme of comparative labour law is silent at its most pivotal points, leaving some concerns of the programme indeterminate and indeterminable. As context, the dominant discourses of the labour law systems of the Federal Republic of Germany (Tarifautonomie), Great Britain (collective laizzesfaire) and South Africa (fairness) are identified and the agents of the jurisprudence (the courts) are briefly outlined. The silence operating within the phenomenology of the labour judiciary and the concept of a 'court' is also examined. The study then proceeds to read, in an archaeological manner, the industrial action jurisprudence in Germany, Great Britain and South Africa, such readings again yielding silences within the discourse of the law. The silences occurring throughout (and the resulting normative breaches in the rationality of the legal discourse) are the prerequisites for <b>juridification,</b> a process in terms of which the metajuridical standard is imported into the legal normative system and thereby rendered part of the archival discourse of the law.
