6000|$|... 'Thank you. That goes {{straight}} to an ethnologist's heart. Well, I must be <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> breakfast. Good Heavens! Old Mahbub here still?' He raised his voice, and the horse-dealer {{came out from}} under the shadow of the tree, 'Well, what is it?' ...|$|R
60|$|Let us <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> wife. She showed herself {{again after}} a long absence, having {{something}} (at last) {{to say to her}} husband.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] replied Jenny tartly. [...] "He eats {{nothing but}} insects, and he catches them flying. Now I must <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> duties at home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I must work! I mustn't stay here; I must <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> studies. Life is {{slipping}} by me, and I am doing nothing, being nothing!" ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{the end of}} {{our third}} day, I {{suggested}} Boston. To this he replied, [...] "No, I've had enough," [...] and there was a tired droop in his voice. [...] "I'm ready to go home. I'm all tired out with 'seeing things,' and besides it's time <b>to</b> be <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> garden." ...|$|R
5000|$|He {{shifted to}} law, {{studying}} at Stanford University {{before becoming a}} labor attorney in Los Angeles. The studios tapped him in 1982 to unify the newly formed alliance, whose members had previously squabbled over how labor negotiations should be conducted. [...] "I planned on doing it {{for three years and}} then <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> practice," [...] Counter said.|$|R

60|$|I see. I have a {{good deal}} to do this afternoon. If you have nothing more {{to say to me}} I'd like to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> work.|$|E

5000|$|On 7 July 2009, Sykes {{announced}} that he had parted ways with Thin Lizzy, stating that [...] "I feel it's time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> playing <b>my</b> own music".|$|R
6000|$|... "Shortly after <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> {{house in}} London, I was privately warned {{by a good}} friend that my owners had decided to prosecute me for willfully casting away the ship, and (crueler still) for having stolen the missing diamonds. The second mate, {{who had been in}} command of the vessel when she struck on the rock, was {{similarly}} charged along with me. Knowing myself to be innocent, I determined, of course, <b>to</b> stand <b>my</b> trial. My wonder was, what Beljames would do. Would he follow my example? or, if he got the chance, would he try to make his escape? ...|$|R
6000|$|Forgive me for <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> sparrows; but truly in {{the present}} state of England, the fowls of the air are the only creatures, tormented and murdered as they are, that yet have here and there nests, and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghost. And it would be well if many of us, in reading that text, [...] "The kingdom of God is NOT meat and drink," [...] had even got so far as to the {{understanding}} that it is at least as much, and that until we had fed the hungry, there was no power in us to inspire the unhappy.|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{sooner the}} better, I say," [...] another speaker remarked. [...] "I am ready enough to fight, but I hate all this waiting about. I want to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> farm again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well--it's been awfully good," [...] cried Arabella. [...] "But I think I must <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> poor man. Father is there, {{so far as}} I know; but I {{had better}} get back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because," [...] she said, {{holding her}} ground though their foreheads were nearly touching, [...] "because if I ever <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> life I don't {{want to make}} it more absurd by real remorse." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You must {{trust to}} me, {{for it is}} as much to me as <b>to</b> you <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Egypt. <b>My</b> wife and home, and children, are on one part, and a slave for life upon the other. You have no cause to doubt it." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{repeated}} <b>my</b> {{suggestion of}} <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> bungalow, {{and this time}} he understood. We clung arm-in-arm and started, and managed at last to reach the shelter of as much roof as was left to me. For a space we sat in arm-chairs and panted. All the windows were broken, and the lighter articles of furniture were in great disorder, but no irrevocable damage was done. Happily the kitchen door had stood the pressure upon it, so that all my crockery and cooking materials had survived. The oil stove was still burning, and I put on the water to boil again for tea. And that prepared, I could turn on Cavor for his explanation.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, dear, {{whatever}} shall I do now?" [...] he ended. [...] "However shall I <b>get</b> <b>back</b> home <b>to</b> <b>my</b> warm {{house of}} grass, my safe little tunnels under the snow, {{and my little}} store of seeds in the snug hollow in the old fence-post?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was anxious}} to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> regiment, sir, as I was afraid that, if I did not return before the next {{campaign}} opened, some other officer might be appointed to its command." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{guess you}} do--a little," [...] he replied. [...] "Sometimes I feel {{you are a}} kid. Then again you {{represent}} the world--your world with its age-old custom--its unalterable.... But, Carley, let's <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then," [...] {{said the}} turtle, [...] "I may expect to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own form {{again in a}} {{reasonably}} short time. But you must be brave, and not shrink from such a little thing as danger." ...|$|E
5000|$|In September Tambalane {{undertook}} a national tour {{to promote the}} album. Gillies told The Dwarf website that {{he looked forward to}} [...] "playing with Tambalane in small venues and really <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> grass roots is extremely fun". Faster Louder's Yasmin Wilding reviewed their mid-September gig at The Yallah Roadhouse, [...] "Carr's got one of the best live rock voices I've heard in a long time ... Gillies ... is an exceptional drummer ... able to keep ... the crowd bopping ... I've never seen a keyboardist groove as much as Masters ... He and bass player Royal gave us impressive solos during the set, proving the worth and versatility of their instruments ... Together, Tambalane were an unstoppable force of entertainment, bustin' out massive tunes".|$|R
5000|$|... “There {{was never}} any falsified data published, and the ORI {{acknowledges}} that now in their report and also that my actions were entirely appropriate and proper,” Fisher said.

6000|$|... "My mind {{might be}} easier, perhaps, if I {{was left in}} doubt," [...] she suggested. [...] "A perverse way of {{thinking}} has set up my poor opinion against yours. But I am <b>getting</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> better sense. I believe you were entirely right when you tried to prevent me from rushing to conclusions; {{it is more than}} likely that I have done Mrs. Vimpany an injustice. Oh, Hugh, I ought to keep a friend--I who have so few friends--when I have got one! And there is another feeling in me which I must not conceal from you. When I remember Lord Harry's noble conduct in trying to save poor Arthur, I cannot believe him capable of such hateful deceit as consenting to our separation, and then having me secretly watched by a spy. What monstrous inconsistency! Can anybody believe it? Can anybody account for it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a ghostly}} house this of yours," [...] Forrest said grumblingly, as they {{closed the door}} behind them. [...] "I shall be thankful to <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> rooms in town and walk down Piccadilly once more. What's that outside?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Mother," [...] I said as I took my seat at {{the breakfast}} table the second day after our Thanksgiving dinner, [...] "I must return to Chicago. I have some lectures to deliver and besides I must <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> writing." ...|$|E

2500|$|On May 29, Harlow was {{shooting}} {{a scene in}} which the character she was playing had a fever. Harlow was clearly sicker than her character, and when she leaned against co-star Gable between scenes, said, [...] "I feel terrible. <b>Get</b> me <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> dressing room." [...] Harlow requested that the assistant director telephone William Powell, who left his own set <b>to</b> escort Harlow <b>back</b> home.|$|R
40|$|I wish {{to thank}} the Evergreen faculty, cohort, my friends, and my family, in their support and {{encouragement}} {{in the development of}} this research. I would like to thank Dr. Jon Davies for his help and advice in cleaning up my ideas and grammar.

5000|$|The {{announcement}} for {{the album}} came on July 1, 2015, {{as part of}} Jewel's monthly [...] "EDA INCLUSIVE" [...] series on her website. In the same post she describes the writing process:"My focus for this CD was to forget everything I have learned about the music business the last 20 years and <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> what <b>my</b> bones have <b>to</b> say about songs and words and feeling and meaning...It took real effort <b>to</b> clear <b>my</b> thoughts and have no rules and just create - going <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> folk/American roots that I began with." ...|$|R
