The interface resulted from a long term research project intended to find a LC-MS interface capable of handling high flow rates (1 ml/min) and avoiding the flow split in DLI interfaces.The TSP interface was composed by a heated probe, a <b>desolvation</b> chamber, and an ion exchange skimmer.

One of the main operational problems of the DLI interface was the frequent clogging of the diaphragm orifices. The DLI interface was used between 1982 and 1985 for the analysis of pesticides, corticosteroids, metabolites in equine urine, erythromycin, and vitamin B12. However, this interface was replaced by the thermospray interface, which removed the flow rate limitations and the issues with the clogging diaphragms.|$|E

5000|$|The liquid {{containing}} the analyte(s) {{of interest is}} dispersed by electrospray, into a fine aerosol. Because the ion formation involves extensive solvent evaporation (also termed <b>desolvation),</b> the typical solvents for electrospray ionization are prepared by mixing water with volatile organic compounds (e.g. methanol [...] acetonitrile). To decrease the initial droplet size, compounds that increase the conductivity (e.g. acetic acid) are customarily added to the solution. These species also act to provide a source of protons to facilitate the ionization process. Large-flow electrosprays can benefit from nebulization a heated inert gas such as nitrogen or carbon dioxide {{in addition to the}} high temperature of the ESI source. The aerosol is sampled into the first vacuum stage of a mass spectrometer through a capillary carrying a potential difference of approximately 3000V, which can be heated to aid further solvent evaporation from the charged droplets. The solvent evaporates from a charged droplet until it becomes unstable upon reaching its Rayleigh limit. At this point, the droplet deforms as the electrostatic repulsion of like charges, in an ever-decreasing droplet size, becomes more powerful than the surface tension holding the droplet together. At this point the droplet undergoes Coulomb fission, whereby the original droplet 'explodes' creating many smaller, more stable droplets. The new droplets undergo <b>desolvation</b> and subsequently further Coulomb fissions. During the fission, the droplet loses a small percentage of its mass (1.0-2.3%) along with a relatively large percentage of its charge (10-18%).|$|E
50|$|Solvent-assisted {{ionization}} (SAI) is {{a method}} in which charged droplets are produced by introducing a solution containing analyte into a heated inlet tube of an atmospheric pressure ionization mass spectrometer. just as in ESI, <b>desolvation</b> of the charged droplets produces multiply charged analyte ions. Volatile and nonvolatile compounds are analyzed by SAI, and high voltage {{is not required to}} achieve sensitivity comparable to ESI. Application of a voltage to the solution entering the hot inlet through a zero dead volume fitting connected to fused silica tubing produces ESI-like mass spectra, but with higher sensitivity. The inlet tube to the mass spectrometer becomes the ion source.|$|E
50|$|Sonic spray {{ionization}} is {{method for}} creating ions from a liquid solution, for example, {{a mixture of}} methanol and water. A pneumatic nebulizer is used to turn the solution into a supersonic spray of small droplets. Ions are formed when the solvent evaporates and the statistically unbalanced charge distribution on the droplets leads to a net charge and complete <b>desolvation</b> results {{in the formation of}} ions. Sonic spray ionization is used to analyze small organic molecules and drugs and can analyze large molecules when an electric field is applied to the capillary to help increase the charge density and generate multiple charged ions of proteins.|$|E
50|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{are being}} investigated {{for use in}} desalination due to their ion exclusion properties. This {{is largely due to}} the unfavorable energy barrier {{that would have to be}} overcome in order to desolvate the ions, as the hydrated ions are often larger than the diameter of the nanotubes. As the diameter of the tube increases, larger and larger ions will be allowed to pass through. Another way to select for a type of ion is to create a charged environment inside the nanotube, to decrease the energy penalty of <b>desolvation</b> for the selected ion. This can be done by incorporating oppositely charged functional groups into the carbon nanotube. This also increases the energy barrier for the oppositely charged ions when compared to the selected ion.|$|E
5000|$|Electrospray {{ionization}} {{has also}} been achieved at pressures as low as 25 torr and termed subambient pressure ionization with nanoelectrospray (SPIN) based upon a two-stage ion funnel interface developed by Richard D. Smith and coworkers. [...] The SPIN implementation provided increased sensitivity due {{to the use of}} ion funnels that helped confine and transfer ions to the lower pressure region of the mass spectrometer. Operation at low pressure was particularly effective for low flow rates where the smaller electrospray droplet size allowed effective <b>desolvation</b> and ion formation to be achieved. As a result, the researchers were later able to demonstrate achieving an excess of 50% overall ionization utilization efficiency for transfer of ions from the liquid phase, into the gas phase as ions, and through the dual ion funnel interface to the mass spectrometer.|$|E

[...] The filtered cellulose solution is then pumped through spinnerets, devices {{used with a}} variety of manmade fibres. The spinneret is pierced with small holes rather like a showerhead; when the solution is forced through it, continuous strands of filament come out. The fibres are drawn in air to align the cellulose molecules, giving the Lyocell fibres its characteristic high strength. The fibres are then immersed into a water bath, where <b>desolvation</b> of the cellulose sets the fibre strands; the bath contains some dilute amine oxide in a steady state concentration. Then the fibers are washed with de-mineralised water. The Lyocell fibre next passes to a drying area, where the water is evaporated from it.|$|E
50|$|The {{interfacing}} {{mechanism is}} contained inside a common EI source, like {{that found in}} any GC-MS system. The liquid phase from a nano HPLC column is admitted from the capillary column port, where the connection tubing and the nebulizer are first introduced and sealed to prevent vacuum loss. The mechanism {{is based on the}} formation of an aerosol in high-vacuum conditions, followed by a quick droplet <b>desolvation</b> and final vaporization of the solute prior to the ionization. The completion of the process is quick and complete and reduces chances of thermal decomposition as reported in the Figure,where a scheme of the interface is shown. The core of the interface is represented by the micro-nebulizer. The nebulizer tip protrudes into the ion source so that the spray expansion is completely contained inside the ion volume. The eluate emerges as liquid phase at a flow rate of 300-500 nL/min, and any premature in-tube solvent evaporation is prevented by a convenient thermal insulation of the nebulizer and the connecting tubing from the surrounding source heat. The high temperature of the ion source, between 300 and 400°C, has a double function: to compensate for the latent heat of vaporization during the droplet <b>desolvation,</b> and to convert the solute into the gas phase. If all components of this simple interface are correctly placed and sized, then each substance separated by the nano-column is smoothly converted into the gas phase, the peak profile is nicely reproduced, and high quality mass spectra are generated. Major advantages of this technical solution are the following: 1) It delivers high-quality, fully library matchable mass spectra of most sub-1 kDa molecules amenable by HPLC, 2) It is a chemical ionization free interface (unless operated intentionally) with accurate reproduction of the expected isotope ion abundances, 3) Response is never influenced by matrix components in the sample or in the mobile phase, 4) It can be considered a universal detector for small molecules because response is not related to compound polarity.|$|E
50|$|Natural product methyltransferases (NPMTs) are {{a diverse}} group of enzymes that add methyl groups to naturally-produced small molecules. Like many methyltransferases, SAM is {{utilized}} as a methyl donor and SAH is produced. Methyl groups are added to S, N, O, or C atoms, and are classified by which of these atoms are modified, with O-methyltransferases representing the largest class. The methylated products of these reactions serve a variety of functions, including co-factors, pigments, signalling compounds, and metabolites. NPMTs can serve a regulatory role by modifying the reactivity and availability of these compounds. These enzymes are not highly conserved across different species, as they serve a more specific function in providing small molecules for specialized pathways in species or smaller groups of species. Reflective of this diversity is the variety of catalytic strategies, including general acid-base catalysis, metal-based catalysis, and proximity and <b>desolvation</b> effects not requiring catalytic amino acids.

5000|$|Aquaporin {{channels}} {{appear in}} simulations to allow only water to pass, as the molecules effectively queue up in single file. Guided by the aquaporin's local electric field, the oxygen in each water molecule faces forwards as it enters, turning around half way along and leaving with the oxygen facing backwards. Why this rotation occurs {{is not entirely}} clear yet. Some researchers identified an electrostatic field generated by the two aquaporin half-helices HB and HE as the reason. Others suggested that hydrogen bonds between asparagine amino acids in the two NPA regions and the oxygen in the water cause the rotation.
