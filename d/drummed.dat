5|$|BEST!, {{a comedy}} play written by Liverpool playwright Fred Lawless, was staged at the Liverpool Everyman Theatre and the Dublin Theatre Festival in 1995 and 1996. The play, which was mainly fiction, showed a {{scenario}} where after Pete Best's sacking, {{he went on}} to become a world-famous rock superstar while his ex-group struggled as one hit wonders. The play was critically acclaimed in both the Liverpool Echo and also in Spencer Leigh's 1998 book <b>Drummed</b> Out : The Sacking of Pete Best.|$|E
5|$|David Lovering (born December 6, 1961) is an American {{musician}} and magician. He {{is best known}} as the drummer for the alternative rock band Pixies, which he joined in 1986. After the band's breakup in 1993, Lovering <b>drummed</b> with several other acts, including The Martinis, Cracker, Nitzer Ebb and Tanya Donelly. He also pursued a magic career as The Scientific Phenomenalist; performing scientific and physics-based experiments on stage. When the Pixies reunited in 2004, Lovering returned as the band's drummer.|$|E
50|$|In {{his major}} work on Sami <b>drums,</b> Die lappische Zaubertrommel, Ernst Manker lists 41 frame <b>drums,</b> 1 ring <b>drum,</b> 2 angular cut frame <b>drums</b> and 27 bowl <b>drums.</b> Given this numbers, many tend {{to divide the}} <b>drums</b> into the two main groups bowl <b>drums</b> and frame <b>drums,</b> seeing the others as variations. Judged by these {{remaining}} <b>drums</b> and their known provenance, frame <b>drums</b> seem to be common in the southern Sami areas, and bowl <b>drums</b> seem to be common in the northern Sami areas. The bowl <b>drum</b> is sometimes regarded as a local adjustment of the basic <b>drum</b> type, this being the frame <b>drum.</b> The frame <b>drum</b> type has most resemblance to other ceremonial <b>drums</b> used by indigenous peoples of Siberia.|$|R

5|$|After the break-up, Strummer {{contacted}} Jones in {{an effort}} to reform the Clash. Jones, however, had already formed a new band, Big Audio Dynamite (B.A.D.), that had released its debut late in 1985. The two did work together on their respective 1986 projects. Jones helped out with the two songs Strummer wrote and performed for the Sid and Nancy soundtrack. Strummer, in turn, cowrote a number of the tracks on the second B.A.D. album, No.10, Upping St., which he also co-produced. With Jones committed to B.A.D., Strummer moved on to various solo projects and screen acting work. Simonon formed a band called Havana 3am. Headon recorded a solo album, before once again spiraling into drug abuse. Chimes <b>drummed</b> with a succession of different acts.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Kennedy <b>drummed</b> for The Blazing Salads with Brian Cadd, Glenn Shorrock, Rex Goh, and Kirk Lorange. Hamish Stuart played drums on Chris Abrahams and Melanie Oxley's 1998 album, Jerusalem Bay. Doyle died on 5 May 2006, and on 28 May the Jim Doyle Tribute Concert {{was played}} at the Basement in Sydney. Musicians {{included}} Renée Geyer, Billy Field, bandmate Loughnan, and Barry Leef, with proceeds benefiting Doyle's family. Dunlop died on 16 May 2009; he had collapsed after drumming at his son's wedding in Sydney. As of 2015, Loughnan is a lecturer in jazz saxophone at the University of Sydney's Conservatorium of Music {{and has been a}} member of its Jazz Faculty since 1978. In 2007 he released a solo album, Ellen St.|$|E
5|$|In November 2005 the Smoking Popes, with drummer Rob Kellenberger, reunited to play Chicago's Flower 15 festival.

5|$|In {{addition}} to these gunnery drills, Broke was fond of preparing hypothetical scenarios to test his crew. For example, after all hands had been <b>drummed</b> to quarters, he would inform them of a theoretical attack {{and see how they}} would act to defend the ship. Though the use of cutlasses in training was avoided a method of swordsmanship training called 'singlestick' was regularly practised. This was a game employing roughly similar cuts, thrusts and parries as were used with the cutlass, but as it was played with wooden sticks with wicker hand guards; hits, although painful, were not often dangerous. It soon developed quickness of eye and wrist. Many of the crew became very expert.|$|E
5|$|When Harith {{arrived at}} Marw in early July 745, however, the {{situation}} had changed: Yazid was dead, a full-blown civil war had erupted in Syria, and Nasr ibn Sayyar, although still occupying the position of governor, lacked authority. Although he recognized Marwan II (r. 744–750), most of his own followers did not accept Marwan as Caliph. Harith was quick {{to distance himself from}} Nasr: he refused the offer of a district governorship, and distributed the gifts he received among his supporters. Harith vocally denounced Marwan II, and was soon joined by 3,000 of his fellow Tamimis, while his secretary, Jahm ibn Safwan, <b>drummed</b> up further support. Within a short time, he had become a graver threat to Nasr than al-Kirmani. After attempts to negotiate an agreement proved fruitless, Nasr attacked Harith's forces in March 746, and scored a first victory over them, in which Jahm ibn Safwan fell. At this point, al-Kirmani joined forces with Harith, and together they forced Nasr to abandon Marw and withdraw to Naysabur. The two allies entered the capital of Khurasan, but within days fell out and began fighting each other. In these clashes, Harith was killed, leaving al-Kirmani the master of the city. The conflict between Nasr and al-Kirmani continued, but was soon overtaken by events: exploiting the conditions of civil war, the Abbasids under Abu Muslim launched their own anti-Umayyad revolt in Khurasan. Nasr ibn Sayyar tried to conclude an alliance with al-Kirmani, but failed when the latter was murdered by one of Harith's sons in revenge. Abu Muslim managed to exploit the situation to his advantage, and in early 748, his men entered Marw, {{the first step in a}} war that would lead to the fall of the Umayyad dynasty and its replacement with the Abbasids two years later.|$|E

25|$|While {{classical}} European {{music was}} emphasized at Carlisle, the students also sang and <b>drummed</b> traditional tribal music in their dormitories.

25|$|Several factors {{determine}} the sound a <b>drum</b> produces, including the type, shape {{and construction of}} the <b>drum</b> shell, the type of <b>drum</b> heads it has, and the tension of these drumheads. Different <b>drum</b> sounds have different uses in music. Take, for example, the modern Tom-tom <b>drum.</b> A jazz <b>drummer</b> may want <b>drums</b> that are high pitched, resonant and quiet whereas a rock <b>drummer</b> may prefer <b>drums</b> that are loud, dry and low-pitched. Since these drummers want different sounds, their <b>drums</b> are constructed and tuned differently.|$|R
5000|$|In Ewe <b>drumming,</b> {{the term}} master <b>drum</b> {{is not limited}} to one {{particular}} type of <b>drum.</b> A master <b>drum</b> can be an atsimevu, sogo, kroboto, totodzi, or an agboba; these are the only types of <b>drums</b> used as master <b>drums,</b> however. Different master <b>drums</b> are used in different pieces. For example, if a group is playing [...] "Agbadza" [...] (an old Ewe war dance), the master <b>drummer</b> plays the sogo. The master <b>drum</b> techniques and playing styles are generally the same regardless of which <b>drum</b> is used.|$|R
50|$|In {{almost all}} West African <b>drumming</b> {{ensemble}}s, a lead <b>drum</b> or master <b>drum</b> leads the group. The master <b>drummer</b> tells the ensemble when {{to play and}} when to stop, he also plays signals telling the other players to change the tempo or the <b>drumming</b> pattern. In some West African <b>drumming</b> ensembles, the master <b>drummer</b> is to play the main theme of the piece and improvise. In Ewe <b>drumming,</b> the master <b>drummer</b> does <b>drum</b> dialogue with the kidi. It enriches the kidi phrase by filling in the empty spaces on the kidi’s part. The master <b>drum</b> can also improvise.|$|R

50|$|Initially the boilers were {{designed}} with 4 <b>drums</b> and 3 <b>drums</b> like the Stirling boiler. The single <b>drum</b> {{at the bottom}} and three <b>drums</b> on the top were connected through a network of tubes which were welded to the <b>drums</b> above and the single <b>drum</b> below. The rational demand of steam in terms of capacity, pressure and temperature resulted in bi <b>drums</b> and single <b>drum</b> boilers.|$|R
50|$|A moving <b>drum</b> hoist, or {{traveling}} <b>drum</b> hoist, is {{a variation}} on the traditional <b>drum</b> hoist. Moving <b>drum</b> hoists effectively eliminate the fleet angle between <b>drum</b> and block by shifting the <b>drum</b> along its axis as it spins. The amount of shift per <b>drum</b> revolution is equal to the pitch of the <b>drum's</b> helical groove. With the fleet angle problem resolved, moving <b>drum</b> hoists can combine <b>drum</b> and head block into a single, relatively compact, unit for mounting to fly loft structure, with a corresponding reduction of installation cost.|$|R
2500|$|An {{electronic}} <b>drum</b> module is {{an electronic}} or digital music device in an electronic <b>drum</b> kit {{that serves as}} the central processing unit and sound module. The <b>drum</b> module creates or produces the <b>drum</b> kit sounds or other sounds selected by the <b>drummer.</b> By itself, a <b>drum</b> module cannot play or sound <b>drum</b> beats. It only produces <b>drum</b> sounds when a performer strikes electronic <b>drum</b> pads or acoustic <b>drum</b> kit instruments that have electronic [...] "triggers" [...] (or sensors) attached to them. When the electronic <b>drum</b> pads or trigger-equipped instruments are struck, this sends a signal to the <b>drum</b> module, which produces the corresponding electronic <b>drum</b> sound (or other sound). Even when <b>drum</b> pads and/or triggers are connected to a <b>drum</b> module, the <b>drum</b> module by itself does not make any audible sound. Like other electronic instruments such as the synthesizer, the <b>drum</b> module only outputs an electronic signal. The performer can hear this signal by connecting headphones to the <b>drum</b> module (i.e., for individual practice) or by plugging the <b>drum</b> module into a amplifier and loudspeaker or PA system for audible practice or live performances. The <b>drum</b> module's output signal can also be patched into an audio console for concerts or sound recording. The nomenclature varies (see below). For example, electronic <b>drum</b> modules are called [...] "percussion sound modules" [...] in the case of Roland Corporation, or sometimes simply modules. A common colloquial term for this device is <b>drum</b> brain. (see below).|$|R
