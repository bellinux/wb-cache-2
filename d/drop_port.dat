Simulated results show that, the add-drop Mobius configuration provides greater phase shift due to the longer length of propagation per roundtrip than add-drop filter configuration. In add-drop Mobius system, <b>drop</b> <b>port</b> generated the optical bistable hysteresis loop with 19. 25 mW output switching power and through port generated lower switching power as 5. 55 mW.

40|$|Abstract — We {{experimentally}} demonstrate switching of a 40 -Gb/s differential-phase-shift-keyed (DPSK) signal {{through a}} coupled silicon photonic microring switch. By simultaneously electro-optically biasing both microring cavities, we achieve 14 -dB extinction ratio for signals egressing from both output ports of the switch. Packetized {{transmission of the}} 40 -Gb/s DPSK signal is achieved with power penalties of 0. 6 and 2. 4 dB for through port and <b>drop</b> <b>port</b> signals, respectively. The effects of a coupled silicon microring are investigated, showing a broad bandwidth and a linear phase response for the <b>drop</b> <b>port</b> are necessary characteristics for routing 40 -Gb/s data through the switch for photonic interconnection networks.

30|$|Relative phase {{shifts of}} through and drop ports for {{different}} coupling coefficients and coupling losses are demonstrated in Figs.  3 c, 4 c and 5 c. Results show that relative phase shift in critical coupling condition is independent from optical parameters of couplers (coupling coefficients and coupling loss). The relative phase shifts of the through and drop ports {{can be considered}} as a new evaluating factor for checking the system on critical coupling condition. When an ADR system is in a critical coupling condition, the through and drop ports will have the butterfly-like relative phase shift as shown in parts c of Figs.  3, 4 and 5. The through gain shows the fraction of electric fields at the through port to the input port, while the drop gain is given by Edrop/Ein. The effect of critical coupling variations in the response of the through port gain versus <b>drop</b> <b>port</b> gain is shown in Figs.  3 d, 4 d and 5 d. Based on the simulated results, the behavior of gains at the drop and through ports remains the same for lossless coupling. It seems that the coupling coefficient is not a determinative factor in the output gains of ADR. Change in coupling losses and coupling coefficients is quite effective in the through port gain. As shown in Figs.  3 e, 4 e and 5 e, increasing the coupler loss can decrease the through port gain. This treat can be observed in intensity response on through port versus <b>drop</b> <b>port,</b> too. The transmission characteristics of light via through and drop ports of ADR are totally dependent on the critical condition parameters, especially coupler’s parameters. As shown in Fig.  3 f, the 50  dB transmission at the through port of ADR corresponds to the 42  dB transmission at the <b>drop</b> <b>port</b> for k 1 [*]=[*] 0.1, k 2 [*]=[*] 0.1 with lossless coupling. An increase in coupler loss will reduce the <b>drop</b> <b>port</b> transmission to a value less than 25  dB. In this case, the through port transmission holds its 50  dB value. Changing the coupling coefficient to k 1 [*]=[*] 0.05; k 2 [*]=[*] 0.05 with γ = 0 will change the through and drop ports transmissions to 45 and 39  dB, respectively. Here, increment of coupler loss solely effects on the <b>drop</b> <b>port</b> transmission.|$|E
