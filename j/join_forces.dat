5|$|In August 937, Olaf {{crossed the}} Irish Sea with his army to <b>join</b> <b>forces</b> with Constantine and Owen and in Livingston's opinion this {{suggests}} that the battle of Brunanburh occurred in early October of that year.

Michael Wood wrote that no source mentions any intrusion into Mercia. John of Worcester wrote that the invaders entered via the Humber but no other chronicler mentioned this. Because of the lack of sources supporting the claim, along with other issues, philologist Paul Cavill argues John's statement is not true. According to Symeon of Durham, Olaf had 615 ships but this number is likely exaggerated.|$|E
