In May 2013 Lord Tebbit {{said that the}} {{coalition}} government's determination to pass the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Bill had alienated grassroots Tories. He also warned <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> a lesbian queen could {{give birth to a}} future monarch by artificial insemination and said that the legislation could allow him to marry his son to escape inheritance tax.|$|E
25|$|In a 2015 {{retrospective}} on Kuhn, {{the philosopher}} Martin Cohen describes {{the notion of}} the ‘Paradigm Shift’ as a kind of intellectual virus – spreading from hard science to social science and on to the arts and even everyday political rhetoric today. Cohen claims that Thomas Kuhn himself had only a very hazy idea of what <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> and, in line with the American philosopher of science, Paul Feyerabend, accuses Kuhn of retreating from the more radical implications of his theory, which are that scientific facts are never really more than opinions, whose popularity is transitory and far from conclusive.|$|E
500|$|Issue #6 {{received}} an average score of 5.8/10 based on 17 reviews from critics on Comic Book Roundup. Schedeen {{gave it a}} 6.3 saying, [...] "Civil War II has had trouble building momentum from the beginning, and this issue does nothing to address that problem. There are some strong emotional moments here, and plenty of stunning artwork from Marquez and Ponsor, but the sluggish pace and generally listless nature of the conflict continue to frustrate." [...] Pepose gave it a 3 and said, [...] "We have two issues left on this series, and judging by the cliffhanger, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> something - but at this point, Civil War II has largely been about circling a conflict rather than diving into it head-on, leaving this event book about as unsatisfying as it gets." ...|$|E
5000|$|Prolagus imperialis {{was named}} after Poggio Imperiale, the place where its fossils were discovered. <b>Its</b> name <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> [...] "first rabbit of Poggio Imperiale".|$|R
5000|$|The town's name {{is derived}} from the {{personal}} name Godek, a developed form of Godo or Gode or a shortened form of Godimir. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> also <b>mean</b> a [...] "suitable, convenient place".|$|R

500|$|The {{notion of}} {{spontaneous}} fission {{had been raised}} by Niels Bohr and John Archibald Wheeler in their 1939 treatment of the mechanism of nuclear fission. The first [...] attempt [...] to [...] discover [...] spontaneous fission in [...] uranium [...] was made [...] by Willard Libby, but he failed to detect it. It had been observed in Britain by Frisch and Titterton, and independently in the Soviet Union by Georgy Flyorov and Konstantin Petrzhak in 1940; the latter are generally credited with the discovery. Compton had also heard from the French physicist Pierre Auger that Frédéric Joliot-Curie had detected {{what might have been}} spontaneous fission in polonium. If true, it might preclude the use of polonium in the neutron initiators; if true for plutonium, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> that the gun-type design would not work. The consensus at the Los Alamos Laboratory was that it was not true, and that Joliot-Curie's results had been distorted by impurities.|$|E
500|$|Suzuki {{described}} Miyazaki as {{a feminist}} {{in reference to}} his attitude to female workers. Miyazaki has described his female characters as [...] "brave, self-sufficient girls that don't think twice about fighting for what they believe in with all their heart", stating that they may [...] "need a friend, or a supporter, but never a saviour" [...] and that [...] "any woman is just as capable of being a hero as any man". Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind was lauded for its positive portrayal of women, particularly the protagonist Nausicaä. Schellhase noted that the female characters in Miyazaki's films are not objectified or sexualized, and possess complex and individual characteristics absent from Hollywood productions. Schellhase also identified a [...] "coming of age" [...] element for the heroines in Miyazaki's films, as they each discover [...] "individual personality and strengths". Gabrielle Bellot of The Atlantic wrote that, in his films, Miyazaki [...] "shows a keen understanding of the complexities of what <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> to be a woman". In particular, Bellot cites Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind, praising the film's challenging of gender expectations, and the strong and independent nature of Nausicaä. Bellot also noted that Princess Mononokes San represents the [...] "conflict between selfhood and expression".|$|E
2500|$|Because Stefani never {{disclosed}} {{the song}} title's meaning, reviewers {{came up with}} various interpretations. In a satirical, line-by-line analysis of the song's lyrics, OC Weekly critic Greg Stacy humorously speculated that [...] "Gwen is apparently {{the captain of the}} cheerleader squad; she is the girl who 'hollas' the chants, not one of the girls who simply 'hollas' them back". The most commonly accepted meaning is that a [...] "hollaback girl" [...] responds positively to the [...] "catcalls" [...] or hollers of men, but <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> to Stefani that she would rather take the initiative and [...] "step it up".|$|E
60|$|Mills’ {{face was}} the very {{perfection}} of indifference. But I who was looking at him, in my innocence, to discover what <b>it</b> all <b>might</b> <b>mean,</b> I had a notion that it was perhaps a shade too perfect.|$|R

Or, on the other hand, <b>might</b> <b>it</b> <b>mean</b> very little to the average user...|$|R
60|$|And {{now this}} little {{laborious}} round-about speech, about going abroad, {{the pleasures of}} memory, {{and the rest of}} <b>it,</b> which <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> anything or nothing, was the only speech he could make. And she did not reply to it.|$|R
2500|$|Journalist Mark Simpson calls Morrissey [...] "one of the {{greatest}} pop lyricists—and probably {{the greatest}}-ever lyricist of desire—that has ever moaned" [...] and observes that [...] "he is fully present in his songs as few other artists are, {{in a way that}} fans of most other performers... wouldn't tolerate for a moment." [...] Simpson also argues that [...] "After Morrissey there could be no more pop stars. His was an impossible act to follow... unrivalled knowledge of the pop canon, his unequaled imagination of what <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> to be a pop star, and his breathtakingly perverse ambition to turn it into great art, could only exhaust the form forever".|$|E
2500|$|The {{principal}} {{interpretations of}} [...] "Iraland" [...] in the Old English Orosius are that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> either Ireland or Iceland. While {{it is possible}} that the original text of Ohthere's account read [...] "Isaland", for [...] "Iceland", and that the [...] "s" [...] was at some point replaced by [...] "r", geographically the circumstances described are better suited for Iceland than for Ireland. Alternatively, given that [...] "Iraland" [...] occurs in the same form, with an [...] "r", twice on the same manuscript page, and given that Ohthere was a seafarer, it may be that he was describing sea-routes to Ireland and Britain rather than actual directions, with no thought for Iceland. Britain, or England, is regarded as self-evident, represented in Ohthere's account through the phrase [...] "this land" [...] (þis land): Ohthere is reported as giving his account in person to King Alfred of Wessex.|$|E
2500|$|This {{rejection}} {{was actively}} advanced by some logicians, most notably W. V. Quine. [...] Quine advanced {{the view that}} in predicate-language sentences like Fx the [...] "x" [...] is {{to be thought of}} as a variable or name denoting an object and hence can be quantified over, as in [...] "For all things, it is the case that [...] [...] [...]" [...] but the [...] "F" [...] is {{to be thought of as}} an abbreviation for an incomplete sentence, not the name of an object (not even of an abstract object like a property). [...] For example, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> [...] " [...] [...] [...] is a dog." [...] But it makes no sense to think we can quantify over something like this. (Such a position is quite consistent with Frege's own arguments on the concept-object distinction). So to use a predicate as a variable is to have it occupy the place of a name which only individual variables should occupy. This reasoning has been rejected by Boolos.|$|E
50|$|The term bateria means “drum kit” in Portuguese and Spanish. In Brazil, {{the word}} is also used for a form of Brazilian samba band, the {{percussion}} band or rhythm section of a Samba School. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> also <b>mean</b> battery.|$|R
5000|$|Eyvindr drew {{heavily on}} earlier poetry in his works. The cognomen skáldaspillir means {{literally}} [...] "spoiler of poets" [...] and is sometimes translated as [...] "plagiarist", though <b>it</b> <b>might</b> also <b>mean</b> {{that he was}} {{better than any other}} poet.|$|R
60|$|The young faces grew serious. The phrase {{meant that}} certain of their number would be {{withdrawn}} from all further games for extra-tuition. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> also <b>mean</b> future success at Sandhurst; {{but it was}} present ruin for the First Fifteen.|$|R
60|$|It {{seemed to}} me that there were a {{thousand}} things that this word might mean. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> that she was already engaged to be married. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> that she had vowed never to marry. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> that she disapproved of such words at such a time. I cannot repeat the tenth of the meanings which I thought I might attach to this word. But the worst thing that it could purport, the most terrible signification of all, recurred to me over and over again. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> that Bertha could not return my affection. She knew that I loved her, but she could not love me.|$|E
60|$|For instance, {{a wooden}} house might suggest an almost savage solitude; a rude shanty put {{together}} by a pioneer in a forest; or <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> a very recent and rapid solution of the housing problem, conducted cheaply and therefore on a very large scale. A wooden house might suggest the very newest thing in America {{or one of the}} very oldest things in England. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>mean</b> a grey ruin at Stratford or a white exhibition at Earl's Court.|$|E

In many DSGE models, this <b>might</b> just <b>mean</b> that agents must obey some exogenously imposed budget constraints, and that prices {{are assumed to}} adjust until markets clear. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> also <b>mean</b> specifying the rules of monetary and fiscal policy, or even how policy rules and budget constraints change depending on a political process.|$|R
50|$|The townland name is an anglicisation of the Gaelic placename “Gort Mhaoláin” which <b>means</b> ‘Maolán's Field’. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> also <b>mean</b> ‘The Field of the Mill’.
