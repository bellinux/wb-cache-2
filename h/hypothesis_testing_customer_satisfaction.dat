The revised model shows an adequate, but slightly lower, nominal fit with the data (grocery stores: χ 2 /d.f. = 3.322, p[*]<[*] 0.001, RMSEA[*]=[*] 0.053, CFI[*]=[*] 0.956, NFI[*]=[*] 0.938; soft drinks: χ 2 /d.f. = 2.473, p[*]<[*] 0.001, RMSEA[*]=[*] 0.053, CFI[*]=[*] 0.968, NFI[*]=[*] 0.947). However, all of the additional direct paths from CSR practices to customer loyalty are non-significant for grocery stores, and only one path (from recycling convenience to customer loyalty) is significant (p[*]<[*] 0.01) for soft drinks. Despite the additional path, {{there is no significant}} chi-square difference between the hypothesized model and the extended model (grocery stores: Δχ 2 [*]=[*] 7.599, Δd.f. = 3; soft drinks: Δχ 2 [*]=[*] 0.272, Δd.f. = 3). Thus, we decided to consider our originally hypothesized model for all subsequent analyses. Independent of whether recycling convenience has an additional effect on customer loyalty, the results indicate that <b>customer</b> <b>satisfaction</b> mediates the effects of CSR practices on customer loyalty (H 2). Moreover, we estimated a model without <b>customer</b> <b>satisfaction,</b> only with direct paths from CSR practices to customer loyalty.

Four groups received daily descriptions of a hypothetical hotel stay over the course of five days. One group had a very positive experience on the first day, and then a neutral to slightly positive experience {{for the rest of the}} days. The second group had a negative experience on the first day, and then a neutral to slightly positive experience for the rest of the stay. Groups three and four experienced a neutral experience for the first four days, with group three then having a positive experience on the last day and group four having a negative experience on the last day. Each group was then <b>tested</b> for <b>customer</b> <b>satisfaction</b> regarding their hypothetical stay. Garnefeld and Steinhoff found that the timing of positive or negative occurrences is what affected satisfaction. For negative events, a recency effect was demonstrated, meaning that negative events which occurred at the end of the stay affected <b>customer</b> <b>satisfaction</b> more than negative events at the beginning of the stay. For positive events, a primacy effect was demonstrated, which means that positive events that occurred at the beginning of the stay affected <b>customer</b> <b>satisfaction</b> more than positive events at the end of the stay. Therefore, the timing of particular types of events in extended service encounters predicts the effect of the event on satisfaction.|$|R
30|$|Once the {{software}} with highest priority requirements are delivered and new version or increment requirements are added in existing source code, ripple effects {{are likely to}} exist in other code parts. It means that other requirements that were working perfectly well before the additions to the code would now malfunction. Regression testing is the only option to not only check the newly added code but also to check already test code. This calls for investing of more efforts, thereby enhancing cost of software and delaying its delivery to its educational organizations. As discussed earlier, such delays {{could prove to be}} very detrimental for such organizations. In order to reduce regression testing, prioritization process could be altered in such a manner that maximum requirements dependent on each other are implemented during the same the same increment. Thus, implementation of next increment would have less chance of creating ripple effects. As a heuristic, requirements with highest regression count and lesser <b>customer</b> <b>satisfaction</b> value could be ignored to achieve more optimizations in regression <b>testing</b> effort. <b>Customer</b> <b>satisfaction</b> is the most important aspect during prioritization. E-learning educational software would find its great acceptability among teachers, students etc., if and only if the needs of these stakeholders are satisfied.|$|R

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a move towards {{incorporating}} ethnographic practices into the research phase of the design process. Groundbreaking work has been done by design consultancies like IDEO (2001), and by trend-predictors such as The Future Laboratory. Large corporations (BMW, Philips and Mark & Spencer) employ ethnographic methods to gather data on the use of their products, their retail outlets, and their customer 2 ̆ 7 s relationship with their brand identity. Video diaries, ethnographic fieldwork, and co-design tool kits (Sanders, 2002) are rapidly becoming the new means for product and service development. Though there are many advantages to the incorporation of anthropological perspectives and working methods into the design environment, (e. g. providing the design team with a more holistic and more meaningful approach to problem formulation) there is also a need to look critically at this migration of practices. This paper will explore the re-contextualisation of these methods and will examine if this is merely a further refinement of strategy, employed by a corporate class, to maintain and stimulate the late-capitalist mode of consumption. These methods may thus be the latest addition to the array of marketing tools, co-existing with the traditional focus group, the market research questionnaire, concept <b>testing,</b> <b>customer</b> <b>satisfaction</b> studies, and so on. The paper will also seek to compare and contrast this migration into the design profession with the application of ethnographic approaches to identity and place as employed by arts and crafts practitioners. Both of which disciplines, unlike design, are much more aligned with the transparency of cultural production of pre-industrial settings. Ethnographic methods provide powerful means for designers, artists and craft people alike, to interpret and understand specific social networks and symbolic structures, and they are able to translate these into meaningful visual expressions of personal and community identity. The paper will use a few examples from design and art in order to illustrate the diverse uses of ethnography; including a large community arts project, completed by the author, at Ullapool, a small fishing village on the West coast of Scotland.  ...|$|R
