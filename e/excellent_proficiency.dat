"I, Thomas Carlyle, {{residing}} at Chelsea, presently Rector in the University of Edinburgh, {{from the}} love, favour and affection which I bear to that University, {{and from my}} interest in the advancement of education in my native Scotland, as elsewhere, for these and for other more peculiar reasons, which also I wish to record, do intend, and am now {{in the act of}} making to the said University, a bequest, as underwritten, of the estate of Craigenputtoch, which is now my property. Craigenputtoch lies {{at the head of the}} parish of Dunscore, in Nithsdale, Dumfriesshire. The extent is of about 1,800 acres; rental at present, on lease of nineteen years, is £250; the annual worth, with the improvements now in progress, is probably £300. Craigenputtoch was for many generations the patrimony of a family named Welsh, the eldest son usually a 'John Welsh,' in series going back, think some, to the famous John Welsh, son-in-law of the reformer Knox. The last male heir of the family was John Welsh, Esq., surgeon, Haddington. His one child and heiress was my late dear, magnanimous, much-loving, and, to me, inestimable wife, in memory of whom, and of her constant nobleness and piety towards him and towards me, I am now--she having been the last of her kindred--about to bequeath to Edinburgh University with whatever piety is in me this Craigenputtoch, which was theirs and hers, on the terms, and for the purposes, and under the conditions underwritten. Therefore I do mortify and dispose to and in favour of the said University of Edinburgh, for the foundation and endowment of ten equal Bursaries, to be called the 'John Welsh Bursaries,' in the said University, heritably and irredeemably, all and whole the lands of Upper Craigenputtoch. The said estate is not to be sold, but to be kept and administered as land, the net annual revenue of it to be divided into ten equal Bursaries, to be called, as aforesaid, the 'John Welsh Bursaries.' The Senatus Academicus shall bestow them on the ten applicants entering the University who, on strict and thorough examination and open competitive trial by examiners whom the Senatus will appoint for that end, are judged to show the best attainment of actual proficiency and the best likelihood of more in the department or faculty called of arts, as taught there. Examiners to be actual professors in said faculty, the fittest whom the Senatus can select, with fit assessors or coadjutors and witnesses, if the Senatus see good, and always the report of the said examiners to be minuted and signed, and to govern the appointments made, and to be recorded therewith. More specially I appoint that five of the 'John Welsh Bursaries' shall be given for the best proficiency in mathematics--I would rather say 'in mathesis,' if that were a thing to be judged of from competition--but practically above all in pure geometry, such being perennial, the symptom not only of steady application, but of a clear, methodic intellect, and offering in all epochs good promise for all manner of arts and pursuits. The other five Bursaries I appoint to depend (for the present and indefinitely onwards) on proficiency in classical learning, that is to say, in knowledge of Latin, Greek, and English, all of these, or any two of them. This also gives good promise of a young mind, but as I do not feel certain that it gives perennially or will perennially be thought in universities to give the best promise, I am willing that the Senatus of the University, in case of a change of its opinion on this point hereafter in the course of generations, shall bestow these latter five Bursaries on what it does then consider the most <b>excellent</b> <b>proficiency</b> in matters classical, or the best proof of a classical mind, which directs its own highest effort towards teaching and diffusing in the new generations that will come. The Bursaries to be open to free competition of all who come to study in Edinburgh University, and who have never been of any other University, the competition to be held on or directly before or after their first matriculation there. Bursaries to be always given on solemnly strict and faithful trial to the worthiest, or if (what in justice can never happen, though it illustrates my intention) the claims of two were absolutely equal, and could not be settled by further trial, preference is to fall in favour of the more unrecommended and unfriended under penalties graver than I, or any highest mortal, can pretend to impose, but which I can never doubt--as the law of eternal justice, inexorably valid, whether noticed or unnoticed, pervades all corners of space and of time--are very sure to be punctually exacted if incurred. This is to be the perpetual rule for the Senatus in deciding." ...|$|E

Francis tells Peter he is a failure as a worker and a father, with this Peter gets tired of trying to please his father and at first {{does not know what}} to do, but then sees on the news that the Pope is visiting Boston. Peter decides to drive to Boston and [...] "kidnap" [...] the Pope so that he could tell Francis what a good father and person he is. Peter takes the Pope to his house; when Lois sees him she is terrified that Peter kidnapped him. Although he kidnapped him, the Pope agrees to tell Francis what a good person Peter is. Before they go, Peter fixes the problems Francis had created for his grandchildren; he tells Chris that what happens in the bathroom is between him and God, and to Meg that it is okay at her age to go out with boys, and tells Stewie about how loving God is.|$|E
40|$|Research {{indicated}} {{clearly the}} importance of participatory evaluation of projects, the involvement of all project stakeholders, and that evaluation is not a once off activity {{at the end of}} a project. There are currently 474 agricultural projects in operation in the Bojanala Region of the North West Province and the objective of this study is to determine extension officers knowledge and participation with regard to their proficiency to formulate project objectives; determine the frequency of project evaluation and to determine the extent of project committee members involvement in the evaluation of projects. Specific attention was given to the influence of the independent variables gender; age; level of education and years of experience of the extension officers. Only 31 % male against 17 % female reveal an <b>excellent</b> <b>proficiency</b> to formulate project objectives. 70 % of the respondents with 15 years or less of service indicated an above and <b>excellent</b> <b>proficiency</b> to formulate objectives. The younger the respondents the more (70 %) they evaluate the projects on a monthly and less frequency than the older respondents (43. 5 %). Only a slight difference occur namely in favour of the more experienced respondents (33 %) against the less experienced respondents (27 %), knowing the committee member’s involvement in evaluation.

40|$|The current study, {{using the}} {{constructs}} of independent and interdependent self-construals, {{examined the effects}} of gender and the level of acculturation on independent and interdependent self-construals of self-identified 1. 5 generation Korean American college students. The 1. 5 generation Korean Americans, who consist of bilingual, foreign-born individuals, encounter inherent adjustment difficulties due to the demands of two conflicting cultures. Independent and interdependent self-construals are individual level psychological constructs that reflect individualism and collectivism, respectively. ^ One hundred forty-two Korean American college students in the New York City area completed a survey packet consisting of the Self-Construal Scale, Suinn-Lew Asian Self-Identity Acculturation Scale, and a Demographic Questionnaire. ^ MANOVA procedures indicated the level of acculturation had a main effect on independent and interdependent self-construals of the 1. 5 generation Korean American college students (F 4, 168 = 8. 533, p 3 ̆c. 05), while gender did not show any statistically significant effect on independent and interdependent self-construals (p 3 ̆e. 05). Also, the interaction effect of gender by acculturation was not statistically significant (p 3 ̆e. 05). Subsequent univariate results demonstrated the main effect was statistically significant for the independent self-construal (F 2, 85 = 5. 477, p 3 ̆c. 05). DFA analysis revealed that the discriminant function equation for the level of acculturation was statistically significant (X 2 4, N = 91 = 32. 589, p 3 ̆c. 05). ^ The 1. 5 and second generation Korean Americans differed significantly on the SCS (F 2, 139 = 3. 276, p 3 ̆c. 05), and self-rated English <b>proficiency</b> (<b>excellent,</b> good, fair) related significantly to independent and interdependent self-construals (F 4, 276 = 4. 077, p 3 ̆c. 05). ^ The results from the multivariate analysis involving the combined group of the 1. 5 and second generation Korean American college students indicated statistical significance for the level of acculturation (F 4, 270 = 15. 945, p 3 ̆c. 05). ^ The findings of the study suggest that counseling approaches for the 1. 5 generation Korean Americans recognize features emphasized in interdependent self-construal and their communication difficulties in English. Recommendations are also offered for future research. ...|$|R

40|$|When {{listening}} to languages learned {{at a later}} age, speech intelligibility is generally lower than when {{listening to}} one's native language. The main {{purpose of this study}} is to quantify speech intelligibility in noise for specific populations of non-native listeners, only broadly addressing the underlying perceptual and linguistic processing. An easy method is sought to extend these quantitative findings to other listener populations. Dutch subjects listening to Germans and English speech, ranging from reasonable to <b>excellent</b> <b>proficiency</b> in these languages, were found to require a 1 - 7 dB better speech-to-noise ratio to obtain 50 % sentence intelligibility than native listeners. Also, the psychometric function for sentence recognition in noise was found to be shallower for non-native than for native listeners (worst-case slope around the 50 % point of 7. 5 %/dB, compared to 12. 6 %/dB for native listeners). Differences between native and non-native speech intelligibility are largely predicted by linguistic entropy estimates as derived from a letter guessing task. Less effective use of context effects (especially semantic redundancy) explains the reduced speech intelligibility for non-native listeners. While measuring speech intelligibility for many different populations of listeners (languages, linguistic experience) may be prohibitively time consuming, obtaining predictions of non-native intelligibility from linguistic entropy may help to extend the results of this study to other listener populations. © 2002 Acoustical Society of America...|$|E
5000|$|The ethos {{and culture}} of the school is based on the teachings of  J. Krishnamurti and the attempt is to:Discover a way of living that is whole, sane and {{intelligent}} and not merely concerned with intellect, memory / skillsLook beyond academic excellence - teacher and taught explore not only the outer world but also the inner - conditioning, ways of thinking and behaviourUnderstand the  importance and limitations of knowledgeTo help one to think for oneself, and out of that feel immense confidence, to be a creative human being and not a slavish machineNurture sensitivity and compassionJiddu Krishnamurti, long acknowledged as one of the world's foremost teachers, dedicated his life to awakening people to their own conditioning and to the possibility of freedom. He maintained,“A school is a place where one learns both the importance of knowledge and its limitation. It is a place where one learns to observe the world without a particular point of view or conclusion. One learns to look at the whole of man's endeavor, his search for beauty, his search for truth and a way of living that is not a contradiction between conclusion and action.It is a place where both teacher and the taught learn a way of life in which conflict ends. It is the concern of these schools to bring about a new generation of human beings who are free from self-centered action, to bring about a mind that has no conflict within itself and so end the struggle and conflict in the world about us." [...] - J. KrishnamurtiA Krishnamurti School concerns itself with education of the total human being. Knowledge and intellectual capability alone are not sufficient to meet life’s challenges. Learning to enquire, to observe oneself, to relate with other people and the earth, is the core intention of the school.A Krishnamurti School is a constantly questioning, evolving institution, with the intention of creating an environment, a climate where one can bring about, if at all possible, a new human being. It is imperative therefore that parents and students understand and appreciate the intention of the school and actively participate in this movement."The purpose, the aim and drive of these schools is to equip the child with the most <b>excellent</b> technological <b>proficiency</b> so that he may function with clarity and efficiency in the modern world, and far more important to create the right climate so that the child may develop fully as a complete human being.This means giving him the opportunity to flower in goodness so that he is rightly related to people, things and ideas, to the whole of life. To live is to be related. There is no relationship to anything if there is not the right feeling for beauty, a response to nature, to music and art, a highly developed aesthetic sense." [...] - J. KrishnamurtiThe school sincerely attempts to translate this intent by adopting the following :Relationship between the student and the teacher- is human to human rather than position to position.Emphasis is on learning and facilitation and not teaching and absorbing.Recognize the fact that each child is unique and one size does not fit all !Methodology and pedagogical techniques  that  ensure that there is no hierarchy of knowledge and suitable for differential learning capacities and learning speedArt, music, dance and sports form {{an integral part of the}} learning processLearning from nature is facilitated by the bounty all around.|$|R
