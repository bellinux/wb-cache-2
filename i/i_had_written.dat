Both of those groups tend to like pure pop music and I think that's what 'Chico' was. It was very different from the slightly leftfield style of 'Look at Me'. [...] The other thing that 'Chico' had going for it was that the music was Latin-based, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>written</b> the song back in 1998 but by the time the summer of 1999 came around Latin-influenced music was ruling the charts. Ricky Martin had recently had a number one and there were others on the way. So it was a strange example of synchronicity that I should be ready to go with a Latin track which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>written</b> almost a year before".|$|E

Irish singer Chloë Agnew recorded the track for her debut album Chloë (2002).|$|E

5000|$|Scripsi was an Australian {{literary}} periodical published from 1981 to 1994 in Melbourne, {{first from}} the English Department and subsequently from Ormond College of the University of Melbourne.

500|$|After {{completing}} Goldwyn in 1989, Berg {{began the}} search for his next subject, who {{he wanted to be}} [...] "another great American cultural figure but — because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>written</b> about Perkins and Goldwyn — not somebody from the worlds of publishing or film". After briefly considering Tennessee Williams, Berg decided to research the aviator Charles Lindbergh, attracted by what he described as [...] "the dramatic possibilities of the story of the great hero who became a great victim and a great villain". Berg convinced Lindbergh's widow, Anne Morrow Lindbergh, to grant him unprecedented access to the man's archives, which he was surprised to find totaled [...] "1,300 boxes, or several million papers".|$|E
500|$|In the DVD {{commentary}} for the episode, Gilligan {{revealed that}} he wrote {{the character of the}} genie, Jenn, with Janeane Garofalo in mind, but she was unavailable at the time of filming. However, he was ultimately very pleased with Paula Sorge's performance, stating [...] "In fact, she was even better than how <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>written</b> the character. In Paula's audition, she came off like a world-weary wise-ass who was not only tough and smart, but had a heart of gold. She made it a really fun character." [...] The casting process to find an actress for the part took so long that an idea Gilligan had to give the character double pupils had to be scrapped when the production team ran out of time to source them. Instead, she wore contacts over her already blue eyes to make them brighter, and a blue jewel on her cheekbone.|$|E
500|$|Grohl's first musical {{performance}} following {{the demise of}} Nirvana was performing with The Backbeat Band at the 1994 MTV Movie Awards in June, during which he was invited by Mike Watt {{to take part in}} his album Ball-Hog or Tugboat?. After enjoying the performance, Grohl figured he could do his own musical project, which could work as [...] "some sort of cathartic therapy, to go out and record these songs that I'd written by myself." [...] Grohl afterwards booked six days at Seattle's Robert Lang Studios, which were located near his house, where he would record [...] "my favorite songs <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>written</b> in the past four, five years that no one had heard" [...] with the assistance of producer Barrett Jones, with whom he had recorded the demo tape Pocketwatch in 1992. The idea was to have Grohl playing all instruments and release it under a name that would make people believe it was a band, similar to Stewart Copeland's Klark Kent.|$|E

"The Survivor" [...] is writer James Schmerer's only {{credit in}} the Star Trek franchise, whose other genre work {{consisted}} of two episodes of the television series Wonder Woman {{as well as a}} single episode of Buck Rodgers. He was better known for his work on soap operas such as General Hospital and Another World. He pitched stories for [...] on the basis that the show targeted an adult audience similar to [...] and not children. He {{knew it was going to}} be broadcast on Saturday mornings, but would be unhampered by restrictions on live-action television. He later said [...] "that was one of the reasons why I took it, because I'm not an animated writer... <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>written</b> a couple of animated shows through the years, and it was like pulling teeth." [...] He explained that he wrote the script for [...] "The Survivor" [...] as if it was a live-action story; it was originally known as [...] "The Chameleon". The title was eventually changed in order to preserve the plot point as a surprise for the viewer.|$|E
500|$|During World War II, Miller {{served as}} part of a bomber crew that participated in the {{destruction}} of the ancient Roman Catholic monastery at Monte Cassino, Italy, founded by St. Benedict in the 6thcentury. This experience impressed him enough to write, a decade later, the short story [...] "A Canticle for Leibowitz" [...] about an order of monks whose abbey springs from the destroyed world around it. The story, which would evolve into [...] "Fiat Homo," [...] {{the first part of the}} novel, was published in the April 1955 edition of The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction (F). Although not originally intended as a serialization, the saga continued in [...] "And the Light Is Risen," [...] which was published in August 1956 (also in F). That work would later grow into [...] "Fiat Lux." [...] It was while writing the third [...] "novelette," [...] "The Last Canticle," [...] for magazine publication in February of the following year that Miller realized he was really completing a novel: [...] "Only after <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>written</b> the first two and was working on the third did it dawn on me that this isn't three novelettes, it's a novel. And I converted it." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1963 Waldron {{had a major}} {{breakdown}} caused by a heroin overdose. He recounted in 1998 {{that a lot of}} musicians in the 1950s and 1960s felt that taking drugs was necessary for career progression. The police assumed they were all doing it, according to Waldron: The police would stop the musicians and search us as we came out of the clubs after work. We had to turn our pockets inside out. After a while, the musicians thought ... well, if you have the name you might as well have the game. Eventually, I overdosed. I couldn't remember my own name. My hands were trembling, I couldn't play the piano. I needed shock treatments and a spinal tap to bring me back. [...] Waldron always felt that he had to return to playing, but this was a slow process. About a year after the overdose, his physical recovery was sufficient to allow him to start relearning his skills, which he did partly by listening to his own records. His recovery as a musician continued for another two years, as his speed of thought was still too slow over that period to allow genuine improvisation: [...] "I worked out my solos in advance and played what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>written</b> out, until gradually all my faculties returned".|$|E

500|$|After repeating to herself, 'Today is your day! You can do it!', Twain {{decided to}} compose a song for self-inspiration. Twain {{described}} the decision to write the song as crucial because it was her first songwriting effort since her separation from Lange. She had to [...] "find [...] as a songwriter" [...] and become independent again. [...] "I was petrified of writing a new song without Mutt. A whole new world for me. It had been many, many years since <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>written</b> by myself so that was new and scary", Twain said. Twain found writing the music quite simple, as it only occupied two lines of sheet music. The lyrics then flowed as Why Not? with Shania Twain progressed. [...] "Today Is Your Day" [...] inspirited her; hence, she considered sharing it with the series. The concept frightened her: [...] "Sharing that song with other people, exposing, and basically allowing myself to be vulnerable the and judged, it scared {{the heck out of}} me." [...] She believed it became a natural theme song for the series. She explained, [...] "From the inception of documenting the journey, the song was also created at that moment. And it has evolved with it all along the way." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{soldiers}} derided {{the attempts}} {{that were made}} to indoctrinate them, but the British public was more susceptible. Philip Gibbs, a fellow war correspondent, noted {{that he and his}} colleagues [...] "identified absolutely with the Armies in the field... There was no need of censorship in our despatches. We were our own censors." [...] The journalistic support for the cause was appreciated by military commanders such as Douglas Haig, who saw the propaganda generated by the correspondents {{as an integral part of}} the Allies' efforts. Haig eventually went so far as to ask Gibbs and Beach Thomas to produce his own weekly news-sheet. Public opinion at home may have been mollified, even uplifted, by the efforts of the correspondents but the troops were not, despite the high demand among them for newspapers from home. One soldier, Albert Rochester, was court martialled for attempting to send to the Daily Mail a letter that stated the realities as he saw them and was critical of Beach Thomas's work, noting the [...] "ridiculous reports regarding the love and fellowship existing between officers and men." [...] Beach Thomas himself later regretted his wartime reports of the Somme, saying, [...] "I was thoroughly and deeply ashamed of what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>written</b> for the good reason that it was untrue... the vulgarity of enormous headlines and the enormity of one's own name did not lessen the shame." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The Wizard of Evergreen Terrace" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder, who had {{a deal with the}} {{producers}} of the show to write five scripts for season ten. Although {{he was the one who}} wrote the episode, Dan Greaney was the one who came up with the idea for it. Greaney based Homer's intense obsession with Edison on the fact that when he himself would have an obsession with something in life, he would badger and bore people with details of it. [...] "Homer's relationship to Thomas Edison's achievements is a version of my own experience of trying to communicate the experience of things you love by driving people crazy," [...] Greaney said in a DVD audio commentary for the episode. The untippable chair was also an idea of Greaney's; while working on the episode, he was leaning back in his chair and fell backwards. He casually said it would be great if there were legs on the back of the chair and someone in the writing room said that would be a great invention for Homer. Soon after coming up with the story, Greaney told it to Swartzwelder so that he could turn it into a script. Greaney said [...] "it couldn't in my best dreams have turned out as good as it did if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>written</b> it." ...|$|E

She would say [...] "tell me a story" [...] so I would tell her a story. So that ability, I very much had that from the start and I used to enjoy that at school so actually to write a script—it suddenly felt like I was just making up a big story.|$|E

2500|$|Herbert Russcol writes: [...] "Soon he was {{intrigued}} {{with the new}} sonorities he could achieve by recording musical instruments and then superimposing them on one another." [...] Ussachevsky said later: [...] "I suddenly realized that the tape recorder could be treated {{as an instrument of}} sound transformation." [...] On Thursday, May 8, 1952, Ussachevsky presented several demonstrations of tape music/effects that he created at his Composers Forum, in the McMillin Theatre at Columbia University. These included Transposition, Reverberation, Experiment, Composition, and Underwater Valse.

2500|$|Drug use (including religious, recreational, and abuse) {{was also}} a theme in many of Dick's works, such as A Scanner Darkly and The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch. Dick himself was a drug user {{for much of his}} life. According to a 1975 {{interview}} in Rolling Stone, Dick wrote all of his books published before 1970 while on amphetamines. [...] "A Scanner Darkly (1977) was the first complete novel <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>written</b> without speed", said Dick in the interview. He also experimented briefly with psychedelics, but wrote The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, which Rolling Stone dubs [...] "the classic LSD novel of all time", before he had ever tried them. Despite his heavy amphetamine use, however, Dick later said that doctors told him the amphetamines never actually affected him, that his liver had processed them before they reached his brain.|$|E
