This was in large part due to Whole Foods' involvement, including highlighting companies' failure to warn consumers the fish contained potentially dangerous levels of cancer-causing chemicals known as PCBs.|$|E

25|$|When the {{hurricane}} hit North Carolina, it flooded hog waste lagoons and released 25 {{million gallons of}} manure into the rivers, which contaminated the water supply and reduced water quality. Ronnie Kennedy, Duplin County director <b>for</b> <b>environmental</b> <b>health,</b> said that of 310 private wells he had tested for contamination since the storm, 9 percent, or three times the average across eastern North Carolina, had faecal coliform bacteria. Normally, tests showing any hint of faeces in drinking water, an indication {{that it can be}} carrying disease-causing pathogens, are cause for immediate action.|$|E

500|$|In June 2005 Kelly put {{together}} Timor Leste – Freedom Rising, a collaboration of Australian artists donating new recordings, unreleased tracks, and b-sides {{to make connections}} between {{a wide range of}} music to raise money <b>for</b> <b>environmental,</b> <b>health,</b> and education projects in East Timor (Timor-Leste). Funds raised from the album went to Life, Love and Health and The Alola Foundation. On 26 March 2006 Kelly performed at the Commonwealth Games closing ceremony in Melbourne, singing [...] "Leaps and Bounds" [...] and [...] "Rally Around the Drum". On 8 October Paul Kelly and the Boon Companions, Hoodoo Gurus, and Sime Nugent performed at the Athenaeum Theatre in Melbourne to again raise funds for Life, Love and Health, and to help support their ongoing programs in Timor-Leste in response {{to the needs of the}} people during the humanitarian crisis.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} SENSOR-Pesticides {{model was}} based on physician reporting. Each state contacted {{a select group of}} sentinel health care professionals on a regular basis to collect information. [...] However, this system was labor-intensive and did not yield many cases. [...] Because different states used different methods for collecting information, their data could not be compiled or compared to analyze for trends. [...] In response, NIOSH, along with other federal agencies (US EPA, National Center <b>for</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Health),</b> non-federal agencies (CSTE, Association of Occupational and Environmental Clinics), and state health departments, developed a standard case definition and a set of standardized variables. [...] As of 2013, SENSOR-Pesticides had 12 participating states contributing occupational pesticide-related injury and illness data: [...] California, Florida, Iowa, Louisiana, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, and Washington received federal funding to support surveillance activities, while Nebraska, New Mexico, Oregon, and Texas were unfunded SENSOR-Pesticides program partners.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{aimed to}} determine how health communication, risk communication, and website evaluation criteria could be utilized to evaluate <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> information on the Internet. Public Health Significance Concerns exist {{about the quality of}} health information on the Internet. <b>Environmental</b> <b>health</b> plays a considerable role in public health but can be difficult to communicate effectively, especially in a dynamic and diverse system like the Internet. An evaluation tool tailored specifically <b>for</b> <b>environmental</b> public <b>health</b> messages on the Internet should be developed to assess the quality of those sites. Methods A literature review identified previous website evaluation tools and general health and risk communication techniques. Using those tools as a framework, a website evaluation tool tailored <b>for</b> assessing <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> information on the Internet was developed. In order to pilot test this tool, five government websites and one emerging <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> issue, particulate matter (PM), were selected and evaluated. i...|$|R
