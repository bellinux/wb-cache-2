40|$|This paper {{presents}} the institutional and spatial determinants {{for the development}} of social and technical infrastructure in municipalities (<b>gminas)</b> in Poland. According to the empirical results, there are significant differences between various types of <b>gminas</b> in terms of the level of development of technical and social infrastructure. Similar levels of technical or social infrastructure are associated with a significantly higher level of economic development in urban and urban-rural <b>gminas</b> than in rural <b>gminas.</b> Spatially, the position of <b>gminas</b> in relation to larger settlement centres and communication routes affects the development of technical infrastructure {{to a greater extent than}} social infrastructure. The relationship between infrastructure development and selected economic and social characteristics of municipalities is a feedback loop in which the relative wealth of a local administrative unit stimulates the development of the infrastructure while at the same time benefiting from this fact. This means that the present use of European Union Structural Funds {{for the development of}} infrastructure does not contribute to closing the gap in development. Sustainable development is largely the result of institutional factors related to infrastructure. It is therefore advisable to move away from a purely redistributive approach in this regard to targeted territorial support of the development potential of municipalities...|$|R
