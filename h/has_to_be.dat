5|$|A pKa value {{obtained}} in a mixed solvent {{cannot be used}} directly for aqueous solutions. The {{reason for this is}} that when the solvent is in its standard state its activity is defined as one. For example, the standard state of water:dioxane 9:1 is precisely that solvent mixture, with no added solutes. To obtain the pKa value for use with aqueous solutions it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> extrapolated to zero co-solvent concentration from values obtained from various co-solvent mixtures.|$|E

5|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} also reduces silica which <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{removed from}} the pig iron. The silica is reacted with calcium oxide (burned limestone) and forms a slag which floats {{to the surface of}} the molten pig iron. The direct contact of flue gas with the iron causes contamination with sulfur if it is present in the fuel. Historically, to prevent contamination from sulfur, the best quality iron was produced with charcoal.|$|E
