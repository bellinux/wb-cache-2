5|$|Alf was a musician, and {{specialised}} in impersonating Louis Armstrong and Al Jolson. He {{played the}} banjo, as did Julia, though neither pursued music professionally (Julia would later teach her son {{how to play}} the banjo). They spent their days together walking around Liverpool and dreaming of what they would <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> — like opening a shop, a pub, a cafe, or a club. In March 1930, he took a job as bellboy on board the Cunard passenger liner SS Montrose. He kept in touch with Julia, writing to her and meeting her whenever he docked in Liverpool. He was later offered a job on a whaling ship for two years—which could have earned him enough money to buy a house—but turned it down when he found out that Julia's father had arranged the job, so as to keep him as far away from Julia as possible.|$|E

25|$|Mode After Hours is a {{spin-off}} web-series which {{chronicles the}} adventures of Marc and Amanda when all (excluding security) staff members have left Mode for the night. The two usually plan on what to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> dressing up as co-workers and mocking them, prepare for a date, going onto online dating sites, competing in certain activities, and inadvertently annoying security.|$|E

To prevent this, Davros arranges for the Thals to wipe out his own people. The Daleks are then sent to exterminate the Thals, but later turn on Davros and apparently kill him.|$|E
25|$|Kitagawa {{was born}} on August 22, 1986 in Hyōgo Prefecture, Japan, and has a younger brother. She grew up in Kobe, and lost many friends in the Great Hanshin {{earthquake}} in 1995. As a child, {{she wanted to be}} a doctor, but by the time she reached high school she was uncertain as to whether she could do that, and not sure what to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> At around this time, she was scouted by a talent agency, and she decided to try the entertainment world. Her parents were initially opposed, but they gave their permission, on two conditions: that she give up if she was making no progress within a year, and that she put her studies first and graduate from university. She has kept the second half of the promise, graduating in commercial science from Meiji University in Tokyo in March 2009.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode an A– grade. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it an 8 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, {{this was an}} uneven yet highly enjoyable mythology episode, far better than the episode {{that appears to have}} spawned it ('Trustno1') [...] I look forward to whatever directorial/writing work David Duchovny might <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> And if this is indeed the last we see of William, well, I’m not going to complain! Still, by now, Carter and Spotnitz ought to know how to write an episode with the time constraints in mind." ...|$|E
500|$|Although Hoglan {{initially}} {{denied the}} definitive break-up of the band, {{saying they would}} go on tour in March 2007, he later stated Strapping Young Lad is on [...] "extended hiatus", and might never reunite again. In May 2007, during a press conference held to promote his new solo album, Ziltoid the Omniscient, Townsend announced his plans to retreat from public view, including giving interviews and touring, to concentrate on his family, and producing solo albums, {{as well as other}} people's music. As a result, Strapping Young Lad were effectively disbanded. Townsend discussed his future projects in a May 2007 Metal Hammer interview, where he stated [...] "there may be some stuff I <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> that is as brutal and heavy as Strapping, it's just not going to be Strapping".|$|E
500|$|Overmars enjoyed further {{success in}} the 1994–95 season. Ajax {{retained}} the league and won the UEFA Champions League, beating Milan in the final. He scored against Bayern Munich at the semi-final stage of the latter competition. In later years, Overmars criticised {{the expansion of the}} Champions League to include non league champions: [...] "When I won it with Ajax it was only the teams who finished first who took part. It's not special any more. I think the Champions' League is just a starter for what they want to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future,</b> create a European League." [...] Overmars' exposure to European football had prompted him to be a sought-after player in England. He knew of Arsenal's interest, but was puzzled as to why a move [...] "didn't work out." [...] In the summer of 1995, he was linked with a move to Manchester United, but said, [...] "No thanks I want to stay with Ajax for two more seasons." ...|$|E

500|$|This has {{resulted}} in several offenders being sent back to prison after breaching licence conditions. Since the unit was launched in 2006 more than 900 people have been filmed by the unit. Not {{all of these people}} are suspects in crime however, people can be filmed if they are thought to associate with prolific offenders or if they have been stopped in an area of high crime under suspicious circumstances. Kieran Walsh, a civil liberties lawyer, said the unit's work [...] "could have implications" [...] for the force under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights - the right to privacy. He believes that filming must be a [...] "proportionate and reasonable" [...] response to a crime and that this {{does not appear to be}} the case as people are being targeted over what they might <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> It is uncertain as to how long data collected by the unit is to be kept but GMP currently anticipate it will be stored for 5years.|$|E
500|$|Large {{quantities}} of two-cent pieces were withdrawn in the 1870s and after. Approximately 17,000,000 of the some 45,600,000 two-cent pieces issued had been repurchased by the Treasury as of 1909. Withdrawn pieces were melted and recoined into one-cent pieces. [...] A bill for a two-cent piece bearing {{the portrait of}} recently deceased former president Theodore Roosevelt passed the Senate in 1920 and was strongly recommended by a House committee but never enacted. Numismatist S.W. Freeman noted in 1954 that few alive could remember using a two-cent piece, {{but for those who}} did, it was often associated with spending it at a candy store. [...] He recalled that two cents would buy a quantity of sweets, as a dime did in Freeman's day, and, he feared, it would take a quarter to <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future.</b> Full legal tender status was granted the two-cent piece by the Coinage Act of 1965, long after the coin had passed from circulation, as it made all coins and currency of the United States good for all public and private debts without limit. Nevertheless, numismatist Jack White pointed out in a 1971 column that due to its short lifespan, the piece [...] "hardly got its two cents in".|$|E
500|$|The {{development}} {{phases of}} the Age of Empires games were similar in several ways. Due to the games being based on historical events, the team often had to do large amounts of research. However, the research was not in depth, which, according to Age of Empires designer Bruce Shelley, is [...] "a good idea for most entertainment products." [...] Shelley also said that Ensemble Studios took most of the reference material from children's sections at libraries. He pointed out the goal was for the players of the game to have fun, [...] "not [...] designers or researchers." [...] At the Games Convention Developers Conference in 2007, Shelley continued with this thought and explained {{that the success of}} the series laid in [...] "making a game which appealed to both the casual and hardcore gamer." [...] Shelley also remarked the Age of Empires games were not about history in itself, but rather [...] "about the human experience;" [...] they focused not simply on what humans had done but on what they could <b>do</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>future</b> such as [...] "going into space." [...] Ensemble Studios developed Age of Mythology in a different way than the previous two games. The team had worried they [...] "couldn't get away" [...] with a third historical-based game, and chose mythology as the setting after they had discussed several options.|$|E

For example, I promised {{to take you to}} lunch, and then when we got there I said [...] "you must pay, because I have given you the benefit of my company". This is past consideration and therefore NO consideration.|$|R
