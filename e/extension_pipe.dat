The overfall area is topped with cut granite, and originally had wooden flashboards held in by pins. The gatehouse is a 1-1/2 story granite structure, designed by Boston city architect George Clough. Located {{at the southern end}} of the overfall, it houses one end of the Sudbury Aqueduct <b>extension</b> <b>pipe</b> from Farm Pond, a 4 ft pipe connecting this reservoir to numbers 2 and 3, and gates for channeling water either into the aqueduct or into the river. The gates allowed water to be selectively channeled from any of the reservoirs (1, 2, or 3) into the Sudbury Aqueduct or into the river below the dam. There are also flood gates and equipment for moving the dam's flashboards. Today the gatehouse, Sudbury Aqueduct, and the pipes from reservoir number 3 remain part of MWRA's emergency systems. If activated the water from reservoir number 3 flows from the dam number 1 gatehouse down the Sudbury Aqeuduct <b>extension</b> <b>pipe</b> to a gatehouse at Farm Pond where it enters the Sudbury Aqueduct proper which in turn brings the water to the Chestnut Hill Reservoir.|$|E
50|$|Japanese housing {{typically}} {{has multiple}} rooms for what in Western housing is the bathroom. Separate rooms for the Japanese toilet, sink, and ofuro (bathing room) are common. Small apartments, however, frequently contain a tiny single bathroom called a unit bath that contains all three fixtures. A small sink {{may also be}} built {{into the top of}} the toilet tank - there is a tap, with the top of the tank forming the sink, and the water draining into the tank - which runs during the flush cycle; this is particularly common in mid-20th century buildings. The room with the sink, which is called a clothes changing room, usually includes a space for a clothes-washing machine. The room containing the bathtub is waterproof with a space for washing, and often for showering, adjacent to (rather than in) the tub. As a result, bathwater is neither soapy nor dirty, and can be reused. Many washing machines in Japan come with an <b>extension</b> <b>pipe</b> to draw water from the tub for the wash.|$|E

All data were {{obtained}} by the Navigable Sampling System (NSS) of the Atmosphere and Ocean Research Institute of the University of Tokyo, which is a deep-sea remotely operated vehicle (ROV) designed to collect core samples with pinpoint accuracy. The pilot vehicle has four thrusters, a payload hook, and two downward-looking video cameras: a color camera (CAM-A) hung from the pilot vehicle using an <b>extension</b> <b>pipe</b> and a black-and-white camera (CAM-B) mounted on the pilot vehicle.

40|$|The precise {{assembly}} of specific DNA sequences {{is a critical}} technique in molecular biology. Traditional cloning techniques use restriction enzymes and ligation of DNA in vitro, which can be hampered {{by a lack of}} appropriate restriction-sites and inefficient enzymatic steps. A number of ligation-independent cloning techniques have been developed, including polymerase incomplete primer <b>extension</b> (<b>PIPE)</b> cloning, sequence and ligation-independent cloning (SLIC), and overlap extension cloning (OEC). These strategies rely on the generation of complementary overhangs by DNA polymerase, without requiring specific restriction sites or ligation, and achieve high efficiencies in a fraction of the time at low cost. Here, we outline and optimise these techniques and identify important factors to guide cloning project design, including avoiding PCR artefacts such as primer-dimers and vector plasmid background. Experiments made use of a common reporter vector and a set of modular primers to clone DNA fragments of increasing size. Overall, PIPE achieved cloning efficiencies of ∼ 95 % with few manipulations, whereas SLIC provided a much higher number of transformants, but required additional steps. Our data suggest that for small inserts (< 1. 5 kb), OEC is a good option, requiring only two new primers, but performs poorly for larger inserts.

40|$|The {{generation}} {{and control of}} manganese sulphide particle size distribution using various mixing configurations were investigated. Specifically, this paper discusses how varying mixing intensities on a macro and micro scale affect the resultant manganese sulphide particle size distribution (PSD) at a constant concentration. The mixing variations were achieved using various Y- and T-mixers as premixing devices into a jacketed, agitated vessel. The reagents used to generate the seeds were aqueous manganese sulphate and sodium sulphide solutions. The {{results showed that the}} absence of micromixing resulted in very poor control of the particle size distribution, the particle size and the number of particles produced. This was {{due to the fact that}} the macromixing time is much greater than the corresponding precipitation time, resulting in different mixing regions existing within the reactor. From the micromixing experiments, the T–mixer was found to be the most effective mixing device at lower concentrations due to the T-mixer providing a faster mixing time than the other mixing configurations, thereby effectively localizing the supersaturation and hence controlling the precipitation. The results obtained from the direct addition without the <b>extension</b> <b>pipe</b> (i. e. short mixing time) indicated a general increase in mean particle size and decrease in total particle number at reagent concentration of 0. 007 mol. dm- 3 as compared to the corresponding micromixing experiments.

Manipulating the Fc-mediated functions of antibodies that engage immune effector cells, such as NK cells, represents a strategy to influence effector cell activation and to enhance antibody potency and potentially efficacy. We developed a novel approach to generate and ascertain the functional attributes of Fc mutant monoclonal antibodies. This entailed coupling single expression vector (pVitro 1) antibody cloning, using polymerase incomplete primer <b>extension</b> (<b>PIPE)</b> polymerase chain reaction, together with simultaneous Fc region point mutagenesis and high yield transient expression in human mammalian cells. Employing this, we engineered wild type, low (N 297 Q, NQ), and high (S 239 D/I 332 E, DE) FcR-binding Fc mutant monoclonal antibody panels recognizing two cancer antigens, HER 2 /neu and chondroitin sulfate proteoglycan 4. Antibodies were generated with universal mutagenic primers applicable to any IgG 1 pVitro 1 constructs, with high mutagenesis and transfection efficiency, in small culture volumes, at high yields and within 12 [*]days from design to purified material. Antibody variants conserved their Fab-mediated recognition of target antigens and their direct anti-proliferative effects against cancer cells. Fc mutations {{had a significant impact}} on antibody interactions with Fc receptors (FcRs) on human NK cells, and consequently on the potency of NK cell activation, quantified by immune complex-mediated calcium mobilization and by antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) of tumor cells. This strategy for manipulation and testing of Fc region engagement with cognate FcRs can facilitate the design of antibodies with defined effector functions and potentially enhanced efficacy against tumor cells...|$|E
40|$|Exquisite {{control of}} {{cholesterol}} synthesis {{is crucial for}} maintaining homeostasis of this vital lipid. Squalene monooxygenase (SM) catalyses the first oxygenation step in cholesterol synthesis, acting on squalene before cyclisation into the basic steroid structure. Using model cell systems, we found that cholesterol caused the accumulation of the substrate squalene, suggesting that SM {{may serve as a}} flux-controlling enzyme beyond 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMGCR, considered as rate-limiting). Cholesterol accelerated the proteasomal degradation of SM, which required the N-terminal domain (N 100), partially conserved in vertebrates, but not lower organisms. Unlike HMGR, SM degradation is not mediated by Insig, 24, 25 -dihydrolanosterol or side-chain oxysterols, but rather by cholesterol itself. Importantly, SMâs N-terminal domain conferred cholesterol-regulated turnover on heterologous fusion proteins. Furthermore, proteasomal inhibition almost totally eliminated squalene accumulation, highlighting the importance of this degradation mechanism for the control of SM and cholesterol synthesis after mevalonate production. On the contrary, treatment with unsaturated fatty acids such as oleate, but not saturated fatty acids, increased protein levels of SM or N 100, as well as reversing cholesterol-dependent squalene accumulation. Notably, the stabilisation occurred through reduced ubiquitination by the E 3 ubiquitin ligase, MARCH 6. Maximum stabilisation required activation of fatty acids, but not triglyceride or phosphatidylcholine synthesis. Stabilisation of a cholesterol biosynthetic enzyme by unsaturated fatty acids may help maintain a constant cholesterol/phospholipid ratio. In addition, we optimised and compared highly efficient ligation-independent cloning techniques, identifying important parametres for project design using either polymerase incomplete primer <b>extension</b> (<b>PIPE)</b> cloning, sequence and ligation-independent cloning (SLIC), or overlap extension cloning (OEC), including the need to avoid PCR artefacts such as primer-dimers and vector plasmid background.

40|$|Automation {{of managed}} {{pressure}} drilling (MPD) enhances {{the safety and}} increases efficiency of drilling and that drives the development of controllers and observers for MPD. The objective is to maintain the bottom hole pressure (BHP) within the pressure window formed by the reservoir pressure and fracture pressure and also to reject kicks. Practical MPD automation solutions must address the nonlinearities and uncertainties caused by the variations in mud flow rate, choke opening, friction factor, mud density, etc. It is also desired that if pressure constraints are violated the controller must take appropriate actions to reject the ensuing kick. The objectives are addressed by developing two controllers: a gain switching robust controller and a nonlinear model predictive controller (NMPC). The robust gain switching controller is designed using H 1 loop shaping technique, which was implemented using high gain bumpless transfer and 2 D look up table. Six candidate controllers were designed {{in such a way}} they preserve robustness and performance for different choke openings and flow rates. It is demonstrated that uniform performance is maintained under different operating conditions and the controllers are able to reject kicks using pressure control and maintain BHP during drill <b>pipe</b> <b>extension.</b> The NMPC was designed to regulate the BHP and contain the outlet flow rate within certain tunable threshold. The important feature of that controller is that it can reject kicks without requiring any switching and thus there is no scope for shattering due to switching between pressure and flow control.

The muffler geometry can be optimized consequently, to attenuate or remark certain spectral components of the engine noise, according to the result expected. Evidently the design of complex silencing systems is a time-consuming operation, which must be carried out by means of concurrent experimental measurements and numerical simulations. In particular, 1 D and multiD linear/non-linear simulation codes can be applied to predict the silencer behavior in the time and frequency domain. This paper describes the development of a 1 D-multiD integrated approach for the simulation of complex muffler configurations such as reverse chambers with inlet and outlet <b>pipe</b> <b>extensions</b> and perforated silencers with the addition of sound absorbing material. The 1 D-multiD integrated approach is exploited to validate the transmission loss prediction of reverse chamber configurations with inlet and outlet extensions. Results have pointed out the capability of capturing transversal resonances at high and mid frequencies. Moreover a non linear approach is proposed {{to take into account the}} presence of the sound absorbing material into the conservation equations of a multidimensional solver. The properties of the sound absorbing material exploited have been taken form correlation adopted in the literature for 1 D models.
