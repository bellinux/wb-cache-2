25|$|In October 2014, Mexico's Industrial Construction Chamber {{announced}} that Grupo Garza Ponce {{was among the}} bidders {{for the construction of}} Mexico City's New International Airport. In the bidding process were other construction companies based in Nuevo León, Jalisco, and State of Mexico. This new construction was intended to take place next to the Mexico City International Airport, which was needed additional space to reduce traffic saturation. The design of the new airport was done by Norman Foster, the owner of Foster and Partners, along with Mexican architect Fernando Romero, relative of Mexican billionaire Carlos Slim. Slim's construction company Grupo Carso was also among the bidders. The value of the project was estimated to be at around US$9.12 billion. Mexico's Secretary of Communications and Transportation Gerardo Ruiz Esparza stated that the government of President Enrique Peña Nieto (2012–2018) likely <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> an foreign construction company with experience in airport construction for this project. He stated that the company would work with domestic firms like Grupo Garza Ponce or others to build the new airport.|$|E

In 2007, 15,000 protesters of all ages began a rally and march as part of the March 17, 2007 anti-war protest, including local activists affiliated with the radical Students for a Democratic Society. After a fringe group broke off from the protest and burned a US soldier in effigy, Michelle Malkin stated that [...] "Portland hates America." [...] The Drudge Report, Lars Larson, and conservative blogs also commented on the effigy, and protest organizers with the American Friends Service Committee stated [...] "We had a massive, peaceful demonstration against the killing and destruction going on every day in Iraq, a positive experience for thousands of people from different walks of life, and apparently the right-wing fringe is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up that little portion." ...|$|E

We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up guitars, have a plonk and see if anybody has got any tunes or ideas. If anything happens we'll record it." [...] AC/DC subsequently announced in an official statement on their Facebook page that Malcolm Young would be {{taking a break from}} the band due to his ill health. It ended: [...] "The band will continue to make music." [...] In June, Johnson announced that AC/DC are [...] "very likely" [...] to be on the road again before the end of 2014. In July 2014, AC/DC confirmed that they have finished recording their next album and that Malcolm's nephew, Stevie Young replaced Malcolm in the studio.|$|E

500|$|... "Nobody Sees" [...] was {{recorded}} by Powderfinger for their 2007 album Dream Days at the Hotel Existence at Sunset Sound Studio, Los Angeles, California, in early 2007 with producer Rob Schnapf. In {{an interview with}} Jay and the Doctor on Triple J in November 2007, Fanning noted that the song is a [...] "bookend" [...] to Powderfinger's early breakout single [...] "Pick You Up" [...] from Double Allergic. He goes on to note that [...] "It's 'who's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> you up now?'. Cause I'm not doing it any more." [...] Fanning also noted that he considers the song a [...] "spacey ballad". Though the band had previously released songs featuring piano, they had decided for this album to record with session pianist Benmont Tench, who previously had played for Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, who {{were one of the}} inspirations of the album. This was in contrast to previous efforts where piano parts had been performed by Fanning or local Australian pianists. Despite Tench's performance on the song, Fanning appears in the music video as playing piano.|$|E
500|$|Ian, Rachel and Geraldine join Rebecca and Carl. Geraldine {{says that}} the room is {{normally}} locked, but Rebecca rebukes her. Stuart rejoins the group after using the toilet. As the group talk, Mark and his wife, Liz, enter the bedroom, unaware of the people hiding in the wardrobe. The pair talk candidly before beginning foreplay and lying down on the bed. Geraldine shouts to alert them, {{and those in the}} wardrobe pretend they did not hear Mark and Liz's conversation. Mark and Liz reluctantly enter the wardrobe. As the doors close, Rachel's boyfriend Lee enters the room, but as the wardrobe has become more cramped, Stuart and Lee hide under the bed and Ian moves to the en suite bathroom. Stuart and Carl argue, and it is revealed that Carl has a fear of intimacy. When [...] "Stinky" [...] John enters the room, both those in the wardrobe and under the bed claim there is no room, so he hides behind a curtain. Jeremy enters the room and tells Rebecca he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up another guest from the train station, but as he turns to leave he mistakenly calls her [...] "Rachel". Andrew, Rebecca's father, enters and becomes annoyed when he sees people hiding in different places. He forces Jeremy, Stuart, Lee and Stinky John into the wardrobe with everyone else and follows them in.|$|E
500|$|In early 1948, Mackenzie King, by now aged 73, {{announced}} his retirement; {{later that year}} Louis St. Laurent succeeded him. Although Bracken had nearly doubled the Tory representation in the House, prominent Tories were increasingly unhappy with his leadership, and pressured him to stand down. These party bosses believed that Ontario Premier George A. Drew, who had won three successive provincial elections and had even made inroads in francophone ridings, was the man to lead the Progressive Conservatives to victory. When Bracken resigned on July 17, 1948, Diefenbaker {{announced his}} candidacy. The party's backers, principally financiers headquartered on Toronto's Bay Street, preferred Drew's conservative political stances to Diefenbaker's Western populism. Tory leaders packed the leadership convention in Ottawa in favour of Drew, appointing more than 300 delegates at-large. One cynical party member commented, [...] "Ghost delegates with ghost ballots, marked by the ghostly hidden hand of Bay Street, are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> George Drew, and he'll deliver a ghost-written speech that'll cheer us all up, as we march briskly into a political graveyard." [...] Drew easily defeated Diefenbaker on the first ballot. St. Laurent called an election for June 1949, and the Tories were decimated, falling to 41 seats, only two more than the party's 1940 nadir. Despite intense efforts to make the Progressive Conservatives appeal to Quebecers, the party won only two seats in the province.|$|E

500|$|The {{people in}} the {{wardrobe}} are uncomfortable, not least because of John's odour. Geraldine passes around mints as Andrew tells Mark {{that he no longer}} has contact with Dicky Lawrence, a potential business contact of Mark's. Andrew sings the [...] "sardine song", but Carl angrily stops him. Andrew and Geraldine reminisce about a scout jamboree held in the house many years ago, but Geraldine remembers that a boy named Phillip Harrison, nicknamed [...] "Little Pip", said Andrew did [...] "terrible things", and that the police were involved. Carl says how Andrew paid Pip's family to move away, and Andrew counters by claiming he did nothing to Pip and was only teaching him how to wash himself. Carl implies that he and John were not as lucky as Pip, and John says he can smell carbolic soap. There is silence, and Stuart points out no one else is looking for them, but they realise Ian has not yet returned from the bathroom. Jeremy says Ian is the person he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up from the station, but when Mark claims Ian is already at the party, Jeremy reveals the person Mark is referring to is not Ian. Outside, [...] "Ian" [...] locks the wardrobe and sprays it with lighter fluid while singing the sardine song. Carl realises Ian is actually Phillip, and the episode ends with Phillip leaning against the wardrobe, a lighter in his hand.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2009/10 season, Tahir {{moved from}} the Titans to the Dolphins.

2500|$|Orbison {{had some}} success at Sun Records, however, and was {{introduced}} to Elvis Presley's social circle, once <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> up a date for Presley in his purple Cadillac. Orbison sold [...] "Claudette"—a song he wrote about Claudette Frady whom he married in 1957—to the Everly Brothers and their subsequent recording of it was released as the B-side of their smash hit [...] "All I Have to Do Is Dream". The first, and perhaps only, royalties Orbison earned from Sun Records enabled {{him to make a}} down-payment on his own Cadillac. Increasingly frustrated at Sun, he gradually stopped recording. He toured music circuits around Texas, and then quit performing for seven months in 1958. In dire financial straits, his car repossessed, he turned to family and friends for funds.|$|E
2500|$|The {{only reason}} that Angel didn't come back...it's a very simple thing. Because our ratings were up, because of our {{critical}} attention, Joss specifically asked Jordan Levin, who {{was the head of}} The WB at the time, to give us an early pick-up because every year they [...] wait so long to give Angel a pick-up [...] a lot of us [...] turn down jobs hoping that Angel will continue– he [...] didn't want that to happen. So, he was feeling very confident and he [...] just asked Jordan, [...] "Like, make your decision now whether you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>pick</b> us up or not," [...] and Jordan, sort of with his hands tied, with his back up against the wall, called him the next day and said, [...] "Okay, we're cancelling you." [...] Jordan's no longer there and The WB has since recognized...I believe Garth Ancier at The WB said that it was a big mistake to cancel Angel. There was a power play that happened that just didn't fall out the way they wanted it to. We wanted to get an early pick-up, we didn't. In fact we forced them [...] to make a decision, and with his hand forced he [...] made the decision to cancel us.|$|E
