40|$|<b>Headnote.</b> <b>The</b> {{ability of}} {{quantile}} regression models {{to characterize the}} heteroge-neous impact of variables on different points of an outcome distribution makes them appealing in many economic applications. However, in observational studies, the vari-ables of interest (e. g. education, prices) are often endogenous, making conventional quantile regression inconsistent and hence inappropriate for recovering the causal ef-fects of these variables on the quantiles of economic outcomes. In order to address this problem, we develop a model of quantile treatment effects (QTE) {{in the presence of}} endogeneity and obtain conditions for identification of the QTE without functional form assumptions. The principal feature of the model is the imposition of conditions which restrict the evolution of ranks across treatment states. This feature allows us to overcome the endogeneity problem and recover the true QTE through the use of instrumental variables. The proposed model can also be equivalently viewed as a structural simultaneous equation model with non-additive errors, where QTE can be interpreted as the structural quantile effects (SQE). Key Words: endogeneity, quantile regression, simultaneous equations, instrumental re-gression, identification, nonlinear model, monotone likelihood ratio, bounded completeness...|$|E

40|$|Humans and {{machines}} are both {{involved in the}} creation of legal research resources. For legal information retrieval systems, the human-curated finding aid is being overtaken by the computer algorithm. But human-curated finding aids still exist. One of them is the West Key Number system. The Key Number system’s headnote classification of case law, started back in the nineteenth century, was and is the creation of humans. <b>The</b> retrospective <b>headnote</b> classification of <b>the</b> cases in Lexis’s case databases, started in 1999, was created primarily - although not exclusively - with computer algorithms. So how do these two very different systems deal with a similar <b>headnote</b> from <b>the</b> same case, when they link <b>the</b> <b>headnote</b> to <b>the</b> digest and citator functions in their respective databases? This paper continues the author’s investigation into this question, looking at the relevance of results from digest and citator searches run on matching headnotes in Westlaw and Lexis for ninety important federal and state cases, to see how each system performs. For digests, where the results are curated where a human has made a judgment about the meaning of a case and placed it in a classification system humans still have an advantage. For citators, where algorithm is battling algorithm to find relevant results, {{it is a matter of}} the better algorithm winning. But neither algorithm is doing a very good job of finding all the relevant results; the overlap between the two citator systems is not that large. The lesson for researchers: know how your legal research system was created, what involvement, if any, humans had in the curation of the system, and what a researcher can and cannot expect from the system being used...|$|R

40|$|A legal {{knowledge}} based system called JUSTICE is presented which can identify heterogeneous representations of concepts across all major Australian jurisdictions, and some concepts within US and UK cases. The knowledge representation scheme used for legal and common sense concepts is inspired by human processes for the identification of concepts and the expected order and location of concepts. These are supported by flexible search functions and various string utilities. JUSTICE is a client-based legal software agent which works with both plaintext and HTML representations of legal cases over file systems, and the World Wide Web. In creating JUSTICE an ontology for legal cases was developed, and this is implicit within JUSTICE. The ontology is a formalisation of an idealised but backwardly compatible conceptualisation of knowledge within legal case <b>headnotes.</b> <b>The</b> benefits of adopting such an ontology include providing the same functionality as JUSTICE. The identification of concepts within data is {{shown to be a}} process enabling conceptual information retrieval and search, conceptualised summarisation, automated statistical analysis, and the conversion of informal documents into formalised semi-structured representations. JUSTICE was tested on the precision, recall and usefulness of its concept identifications; achieving good results.
