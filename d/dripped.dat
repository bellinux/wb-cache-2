5|$|The tests {{revealed}} {{a number of}} problems in that the thick wing inherited from the Yak-3 limited the top speed of the aircraft, the engine exhaust damaged the surface of the airfield, the cockpit often filled with smoke from kerosene and oil that had <b>dripped</b> onto the engine, and the aircraft was very short-ranged. Despite these problems, the Yak-15 proved to be very easy to fly, even for pilots accustomed to piston-engined fighters, and caused the VVS to accept the fighter as a conversion trainer.|$|E
5|$|After {{eight months}} of bloody {{fighting}} {{it was decided to}} evacuate the entire force on the Gallipoli peninsula. Troop numbers were progressively reduced from 7 December and cunning ruses were performed to fool the Turks and to prevent them from discovering the Allies that were departing. At Anzac, the troops would maintain utter silence for an hour or more until the curious Turks would venture out to inspect the trenches, whereupon the Anzacs would open fire. As the numbers in the trenches were thinned, rifles were rigged to fire by water <b>dripped</b> into a pan attached to the trigger. In what was ironically the best planned operation of the campaign, the evacuation was completed by dawn on 20 December 1915, without a single casualty.|$|E

5|$|Contamination {{by water}} during filling {{may be due}} to two causes. Inadequate {{filtration}} and drying of the compressed air can introduce small quantities of fresh water condensate, or an emulsion of water and compressor lubricant, and failing to clear the cylinder valve orifice of water which may have <b>dripped</b> from wet dive gear, which can allow contamination by fresh or seawater. Both cause corrosion, but seawater contamination can cause a cylinder to corrode rapidly {{to the extent that it}} may be unsafe or condemned after even a fairly short period. This problem is exacerbated in hot climates, where chemical reactions are faster, and is more prevalent where filling staff are badly trained or overworked.|$|E

To increase her resistance to the cold, Day instructed Sabrina to wade into Stowe Pool until the water reached her neck, then lie in the nearby meadow until her clothes and hair had dried in the sun. Finally, to test her resistance to luxury, he gave her a big box of handmade silk clothes and had her throw them on a fire. Day had limited success with these techniques.

5|$|Ralston, who {{considered}} the Enterprise ugly {{and the model}} hard to shoot, delighted in destroying the ship. Several shots were combined together for the complete destruction sequence; while Ralston {{would have preferred to}} take a mallet to the original $150,000 model, a variety of cheaper models were used. The first part of the ship to be destroyed was the bridge, a separate miniature with stars added to the background. The shot switches to the Bird of Prey moving away as the top of the saucer burns, where explosions (filmed upside down to simulate the absence of gravity) were superimposed over a motion control pass of the ship. The camera cuts to a closeup of the ship's registration number being eaten away by inner explosions. George created a light Styrofoam model that was dissolved by acetone <b>dripped</b> on the saucer from above. By shooting at less than one frame per second and keeping light off the model, the drips were not visible in the print. Burning steel wool {{on the inside of the}} saucer created a glowing ember effect from the ship's inner decks being destroyed. The saucer explosion was simulated by blowing up a talcum powder-covered plaster dish. Two and fourounce bombs and gasoline were used as pyrotechnics in live action scenes of the bridge being destroyed. Stuntmen used spring-loaded platforms to launch themselves in the air.|$|E
40|$|Vitamin D {{interacting}} protein 205 (<b>DRIP</b> 205) is {{a mediator}} complex protein that anchors the complex to the estrogen receptor (ER) and other nuclear receptors (NRs). In ZR- 75 breast cancer cells treated with 17 ?-estradiol (E 2) and transfected with a construct containing three tandem estrogen responsive elements (pERE 3), <b>DRIP</b> 205 coactivates ER?-mediated transactivation. <b>DRIP</b> 205 ? 587 - 636 is a <b>DRIP</b> 205 mutant {{in which both}} NR boxes within amino acids 587 - 636 have been deleted and, in parallel transfection studies, <b>DRIP</b> 205 ? 587 - 636 also coactivates ER?. Moreover, both wild-type and variant <b>DRIP</b> 205 also colocalize with ER? in the nuclei of transfected cells. AF 1 and AF 2 of ER? are both required for <b>DRIP</b> 205 coactivation. Extensive deletion analysis of <b>DRIP</b> 205 shows that multiple domains of this protein {{play a role in}} coactivation of ER? and in interactions with ER?. On the other hand, both <b>DRIP</b> 205 and <b>DRIP</b> 205 ? 587 - 636 coactivate E 2 -induced transactivation of ER?/Sp 1 in cells transfected with a construct containing three GC-rich sites (pSp 13). Coactivation of ER?/Sp 1 by <b>DRIP</b> 205 is dependent on AF 1 of ER?. Enhancement of ER? and ER?/Sp 1 by <b>DRIP</b> 205 does not require NR boxes of <b>DRIP</b> 205, and deletion mutants <b>DRIP</b> 205 (1 - 714) and <b>DRIP</b> 205 (516 - 1566) significantly coactivate ER? and ER?/Sp 1. RNA interference study showed that <b>DRIP</b> 205 coactivation of ER?/Sp was abolished in cells transfected with iSp 3 and iSp 4, suggesting that Sp 3 and Sp 4 are required for coactivation of ER?/Sp by <b>DRIP</b> 205 in ZR- 75 cells...|$|R
40|$|Fog <b>drip</b> {{and related}} microclimatic factors were {{measured}} between January 1999 and December 2002 at a tropical seasonal rain forest in Xishuangbanna, South-West China.

5|$|For {{the final}} {{destruction}} of the Genesis planet, footage from the Paramount set had to be carefully matched with ILM effects footage. ILM built scale miniatures cut into sections to portray parts of Genesis' upheaval (rock slides, fissures opening in the ground) that live-action scenes could not easily replicate. One of the largest miniatures, measuring , had trick trees and trapdoors that could be reset, propane jets for gusts of fire, and solenoid-triggered rockfalls. For scenes where Kirk and Kruge battle at a precipice over a pit of lava, the shot combined animated lava, clouds (really cotton daubs on black), lightning, and a matte painting. Overhead shots of the lava were created by lighting a piece of clear Plexiglass with colored gels and covering the plate with methacyl, vermiculite and charcoal; the mixture <b>dripped</b> off the surface and coated the crew underneath. ILM simulated Kruge's demise, a long plunge into the pool of lava, {{with the help of}} a stop-motion puppet. Lloyd fell a few feet onto a black mattress; during a lighting flash the actor was replaced by the puppet that fell the rest of the distance. Because the shot was filmed on black instead of the traditional bluescreen, the animators had to remove or rotoscope the black background around Lloyd one frame at a time. The transition between the footage of Lloyd and the puppet was hidden by a single-frame flash as a bolt of lightning struck Kruge. The scene of Kirk and Spock beaming away as the ground collapses was another created at ILM, as the level of destruction was simply not possible for the live action crew.|$|E

40|$|<b>Drip</b> rate {{data have}} been {{collected}} at 15 min intervals at six locations in Stump Cross Caverns, N England, since 1998.

In our continuous data sampling we observe rapid discharge increases which appear to be synchronous between <b>drips</b> sites, and which can be explained by flow switching of the water overlying the cave during times of high infiltration rate, such as intense rain storms or rapid snowmelt. A test for non-linearity (White test) in the <b>drip</b> series provides very strong evidence that many of the <b>drip</b> sequences are non-linear. We conclude that at our <b>drip</b> sites there is a non-linear input (weather) and non-linearities within the karst system leading to non-linear dripping, which is independent of <b>drip</b> rate.
