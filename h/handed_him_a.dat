5|$|The Vita Waldevi {{provides}} further legendary {{detail of}} Siward's journey from Scandinavia to England. According to the Vita, Siward passed through Orkney, killing a dragon there {{before moving on}} to Northumbria. There he encountered another dragon, before meeting an Oðinn-like old man on a hill, who <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> raven banner and instructed him to proceed to London to receive the patronage of the king of England.|$|E
5|$|On 30 March, Foreign Minister Momčilo Ninčić {{summoned the}} German {{ambassador}} Viktor von Heeren and <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> statement which {{declared that the}} new government would accept all its international obligations, including accession to the Tripartite Pact, {{as long as the}} national interests of the country were protected. Von Heeren returned to his office to discover a message from Berlin instructing that contact with Yugoslav officials was to be avoided, and he was recalled to Berlin. No reply was given to Ninčić. On 2 April orders were issued for the evacuation of the German embassy, and the German chargé d'affaires advised the diplomats of friendly countries to leave the country.|$|E

5|$|A meeting {{among the}} party leaders, {{including}} Whitlam and Fraser, {{to resolve the}} crisis {{on the morning of}} 11 November came to nothing. Kerr and Whitlam met at the Governor-General's office that afternoon at 1.00pm. Unknown to Whitlam, Fraser was waiting in an ante-room; Whitlam later stated that he would not have set foot in the building if he had known Fraser was there. Whitlam, as he had told Kerr by phone earlier that day, came prepared to advise a half-Senate election, to be held on 13December. Kerr instead told Whitlam that he had terminated his commission as prime minister, and <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter to that effect. After the conversation, Whitlam returned to the Prime Minister's residence, The Lodge, had lunch and conferred with his advisers. Immediately after his meeting with Whitlam, Kerr commissioned Fraser as 'caretaker' Prime Minister, on the assurance he could obtain supply and would then advise Kerr to dissolve both houses for election.|$|E
5|$|Barrett had a {{trial with}} Major League Soccer team the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, and {{claimed he was}} offered a two-year contract, {{although}} this claim was denied by an organisation spokesman. He started a trial with League Two club Oxford United in August 2005 and in his first match was substituted after six minutes after sustaining a head injury. He resumed playing in the SPL after signing for Livingston on 9 September 2005, on a contract until January 2006, with the option of it being extended for a further three years, following a successful trial. He made his debut two days later in a 4–1 defeat to Hearts, during which he conceded a penalty kick. He made 11 appearances for Livingston, with his last coming in December 2005. Conference National club Exeter City <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> one-week trial in September 2006, and after training with them for six weeks he was offered a contract until January 2007.|$|E
5|$|Hamilton made a {{pit stop}} on lap 35, coming out behind his teammate, driving {{over the white}} pit exit line in the process. This <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> five-second time penalty {{to be added to}} his {{finishing}} time. Sebastian Vettel came in two laps later, being stationary for more than 13 seconds due to a problem with the wheelnut of his rear right tyre and came out behind Felipe Massa in fourth place. Meanwhile, Romain Grosjean retired with gearbox issues. Vettel closed the gap to Massa in the last podium position, but was eventually unable to pass the Brazilian, handing Massa his first podium finish of 2015. Toward the end of the race, Pastor Maldonado was racing Max Verstappen for seventh place. Going past the start/finish straight, Maldonado almost lost the rear of his car coming out of the Toro Rosso's slipstream, while Verstappen locked up going into turn one, handing the position to the Lotus driver. Rosberg, who complained about vibrations in his front tyres during the last laps, crossed the finish line three seconds ahead of teammate Hamilton, taking his third victory of the season and the second consecutive one at Spielberg, reducing his championship gap to ten points.|$|E

5|$|Upfront, Vettel {{had reduced}} {{the gap between}} himself and Alonso to one second by lap50 as the pair {{continued}} to trade the fastest lap time. Glock started to slow on the circuit {{and drove to the}} pit lane to retire. It was later confirmed that his retirement was the result of an issue with his car's hydraulic system. With the advantage of having newer tyres which gave him more grip, Kubica was able to make short work of Alguersuari, Buemi, his teammate Petrov, Massa, Hülkenberg, and Sutil (who was holding up a queue of five cars) in the space of nine laps. Vettel continued to pressure race-leader Alonso in the closing laps as the pair began to encounter slower cars. Kovalainen and Buemi made contact in the final sector of the lap, with the latter spinning around in front of the Toro Rosso, who was quick to avoid a head-on collision. Kovalainen's car suffered a cracked fuel tank pressure release valve and he limped back to the pit lane, the rear of his Lotus catching fire during the final few turns. Kovalainen aborted the pit entry, but did not make it much further as his car was consumed by the fire. Kovalainen stopped on the main straight and got out of his car to extinguish the fire himself after members of the Williams team <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> fire extinguisher. As Kovalainen was off the racing line, yellow flags were waved in the final corners instead of a safety car deployment.|$|E
5|$|On {{account of}} the rivalry between the chiefs of Bobbili and Vizianagaram, in 1756 there was a {{rebellion}} among the local chieftains which necessitated strong military measures. General Bussy attacked the rebel forces with a contingent of European forces, supported by 11,000 troops of the Raja of Vizianagaram as a token of his loyalty. The Raja of Vizianagaram instigated General Bussy by a canard stating that the Raja of Bobbili was behind the rebellion. It is {{also said that the}} Raja bribed his interpreters to persuade General Bussy to direct Ranga Rao, the Raja of Bobbili to vacate the Bobbili Fort and shift southward. General Bussy cautiously made an offer to the Chief of Bobbili that he would be pardoned if he moved away from Bobbili, and in return given a compensatory package of equivalent land elsewhere. But this was not acceptable to the Chief of Bobbili. Then, General Bussy attacked the fort several times, breached the mud fort with cannons, and took control of the ramparts of the fort. Although the Raja of Bobbili and his defenders realized their precarious condition, they fought fiercely but eventually lost the battle. When General Bussy entered the fort with his depleted strength of soldiers he found dead bodies scattered in the fort area. At that time an old man approached General Bussy and <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> child who he said was the son of the dead Raja of Bobbili. The Raja of Vizianagaram, happy with his victory in the hard fought battle, rejoiced by entering the Bobbili city and hoisted the Flag of France. But his jubilation was short lived. Three days after this event, the Raja of Vizianagaram's camp was attacked in the night by three people of Bobbili, including Tandra Paparayudu who had rushed to the demolished Bobbili Fort to help his sister's family. He killed the Raja of Vizianagaram and then committed suicide along with his accomplices.|$|E

Sensing George's potential, his coach <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> leading role his senior season. That year, George led Knight to the Golden League championship, and was named the Golden League Most Valuable Player, the Antelope Valley Press Player of the Year, {{and a member of the}} Daily News 2007–08 All-Area Boys' basketball team. He ended his senior year averaging 23.2 points and 11.2 rebounds.|$|E
25|$|In India's 2001 tour of South Africa in {{the second}} test match between India and South Africa at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth, match referee Mike Denness fined four Indian players for {{excessive}} appealing, as well as fined the Indian captain Sourav Ganguly for not controlling his team. Tendulkar was given a suspended ban of one game by Denness in light of alleged ball tampering. Television cameras picked up images that suggested Tendulkar {{may have been involved}} in cleaning the seam of the cricket ball. This can, under some conditions, amount to altering the condition of the ball. Denness found Sachin Tendulkar guilty of ball tampering charges and <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> one Test match ban. The incident escalated to include sports journalists accusing Denness of racism, and led to Denness being barred from entering the venue of the third Test match. The ICC revoked the status of the match as a Test as the teams rejected the appointed referee. The charges against Tendulkar and Sehwag's ban for excessive appealing triggered a massive backlash from the Indian public.|$|E
25|$|Hart {{appeared}} on the September 10, 2012 episode of Raw at the Bell Centre in Montreal, marking his return {{for the first time}} to the same building where the Screwjob occurred, where he took part in an interview segment featuring John Cena and WWE Champion CM Punk. However, the episode was overshadowed by Jerry Lawler's real on-air heart attack earlier in the evening, from which he eventually made a full recovery. He also briefly appeared during the 2013 Royal Rumble, giving a pep talk to Alberto Del Rio before his World Heavyweight Champion title bout with Big Show. On the May 27, 2013 episode of Raw, it was named 'Bret Hart Appreciation Night'. Bret was pictured in the evening speaking to the likes of Kane, Daniel Bryan and Cena among others.

25|$|McKenzie {{attended}} John Curtin High School, {{where he}} performed well with both bat and {{ball in the}} school's first XI. At sixteen he was made his first grade debut for Claremont-Cottesloe as a batsman, but after unproductive performances was dropped to the second XI. The following year in 1958–59, he continued in second grade and took up fast bowling, taking 50 wickets {{at an average of}} 14.50 after his team had a pace bowling shortage. He was recalled to the First XI in 1959–60. He finished the season with 515 runs at an average of 39.46 and 49 wickets at an average of 11.21. His efforts were rewarded in when the state selectors <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> debut for the penultimate match of the Sheffield Shield season against Victoria in Melbourne. He went wicketless and scored 22 and 41. He took his first wickets in the final match against South Australia at Perth with 3/69. At season’s end, his captain Ken Meuleman advised McKenzie to concentrate on his fast bowling.|$|E
25|$|The {{crew were}} kept in {{separate}} cells in a well guarded wooden prison. During the imprisonment, the Japanese began interrogating the officers with many precise questions, revealing the lack of knowledge that both cultures had for the other. On 25 August, the commander brought Golovnin his personal wares from his cabin on the Diana, much to his surprise, but the Diana had not been captured but had simply sent these items ashore. He was later brought before the governor of Hokkaido and made to discuss the events that took place by Resanov and Chwostoff. The governor <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> letter from the remaining officers of the Diana who explained why {{they were not able}} to save them in the Kurils and that they would work towards their release. Golovnin was also provided with another letter written in 1806 by Chwostoff, stating that he had annexed the island of Sakhalin {{in the name of the}} Tsar. The Japanese had also annexed Sakhalin in 1807 in fear of growing Russian interference. The letter convinced many of the Japanese that Golovnin was a Russian spy. The Japanese continued pressing questions to Golovnin and he and the crew were moved to a new prison in Matsumae.|$|E
25|$|Seven months later, Foley {{made his}} return to Raw on March 5, 2007 as a face again and tricked McMahon into giving him his job back. On April 9, Foley contributed to the Make-a-Wish Foundation and helped a young child named Michael Peña to become an honorary General Manager of the night. Foley {{appeared}} again on June 11 for Mr. McMahon Appreciation Night insulting McMahon. Foley also announced his place as a number one contender for the WWE Championship. During the Raw broadcast before , Foley was scheduled to make his official in-ring return in a match against Umaga but he attacked Umaga before the match, and the match was never started. At Vengeance, Foley wrestled in a WWE Championship Challenge match involving WWE Champion John Cena, Randy Orton, King Booker, and Bobby Lashley. Cena retained by pinning Foley. A month later, Foley made an appearance on Raw as the special guest referee for a match between Jonathan Coachman and Mr. McMahon's storyline illegitimate son Hornswoggle. Hornswoggle won the match, after Foley <b>handed</b> <b>him</b> <b>a</b> miniature Mr. Socko. Foley then made an appearance on SmackDown the same week, where he defeated Coachman with Hornswoggle as the special guest referee. On the January 7, 2008 episode of Raw, Foley and his tag team partner Hornswoggle qualified for the Royal Rumble by defeating The Highlanders, but Foley was eliminated by Triple H during the Royal Rumble match.|$|E
