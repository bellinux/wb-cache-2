40|$|Sri Lanka {{being an}} island it is {{inevitable}} to utilize the ocean wave energy as a sustainable energy source. The device called “Pendulor”, which is invented in Japan and has proven 40 - 50 % of wave energy conversion efficiency at the sea of Muroran, Japan. The low wave energy density oceanic climate of Sri Lanka makes this device more preferred, because of its high energy conversion capability. The device consist a pendulum flap <b>hinged</b> <b>inside</b> a caisson and the caisson is faced to the ocean waves. The economical feasibility of this device depends on the construction cost. The conventional caisson is a straight chamber and this type of a device is infeasible because of the length that causes increase in construction cost. A modified caisson is proposed to shorten the caisson length towards the sea and to increase the frequency bandwidth of operation. Model testing of this modified caisson with a solid friction damper is addressed in this endeavor. Laboratory experiments were conducted with a 1 / 16 scale model of the proposed caisson. A solid friction damper {{was used for the}} model testing and a mathematical model for the device was developed and the parametric modeling was done by using MATLAB. The power conversion efficiency with a modified caisson was discussed in this endeavor...|$|E

40|$|Most of {{existing}} reinforced concrete structures suffer due to corrosion {{of steel and}} concrete degradation. In many cases existing structures reveal to be inadequate to absorb the expected seismic load {{and need to be}} rehabilitated according to the in force code. In the worst case some structures have not been designed to absorb horizontal actions. The rehabilitation process begins with the complete knowledge of its geometrical configuration and the evaluation of the vulnerability of the structure to seismic loads. This analysis permits to identify critical zones and to establish focused strengthening actions. A comparison between the behavior of the structure in the current and in the future configurations determines the goodness of adopted intervention techniques. The evaluation of the vulnerability of an RC structure to seismic loads can be done by performing nonlinear finite element analyses. In literature, three different approaches have been tuned to simulate the elastoplastic behavior of a beam/column element: lumped elastoplasticity models, distributed nonlinearity models, fiber models. Lumped models consider the constitutive nonlinearity concentrated at a section level of a frame element, usually employing nonlinear springs at the ends of beam/column elements. Distributed nonlinearity models average the nonlinearity over a finite element by considering the possibility to form plastic hinges at different evaluation points of the element and calculating weighted integrals of the section responses. Fiber models subdivide a section with a large number of finite elements and nonlinearity is related to the stress-strain relationship of a single finite element. Within lumped models, commercial finite element programs contemplate the possibility to develop plasticity at the two ends of the beam only. In the particular cases where plasticity concentrates in points different than the ends of the beam, it computationally comes in the need to proceed with a re-meshing of the model or in the definition of multiple elements before running the analysis. In the first case, it results in an increased computational cost of the analysis. In the second case, a less precision of the response is obtained especially when the exact position of the plastic hinge is not a-priori known. The present work is devoted to the implementation of a new elastoplastic 3 D Euler-Bernoulli beam element including slope discontinuities, in the framework of lumped elastoplasticity models. In the new finite element, plastic hinges can appear at any position of the beam, theoretically in a priori not-established number. Multiple slope discontinuities are included in the analysis through a non uniform bending stiffness of the beam, making use of the Dirac-delta function. Fictitious springs, with a stiffness variable according to the level of plasticity in the section, transfer the correct bending moment in correspondence of plastic hinges. The nonlinear behavior of the hinge is defined in the framework of a thermo-dynamically consistent elastoplastic theory. Associated flow rules are derived in the classical manner adopting a convex activation domain known in literature and experimentally calibrated for reinforced concrete sections. The activation domain is similar to the one suggested by the Italian seismic code. It is given in a My-Mz bending moment reference system for a fixed axial force. An elastoplastic behavior is assumed for section curvatures, while deformations in the axial and shear directions are assumed elastic. The elastoplastic frame element is introduced in a finite element analysis program to run nonlinear simulations on 2 D and 3 D framed structures. To this end, state equations and flow rules are rewritten in a discrete manner to solve the single iteration of the Newton-Raphson procedure. A classic elastic predictor phase is followed by a plastic corrector phase in the case of activation of the inelastic phenomena. The corrector phase is based on the evaluation of return bending moments by employing the closest point projection method, in order to satisfy the loading-unloading conditions (Kuhn-Tucker relations). The formation of one or more <b>hinges</b> <b>inside</b> a finite element modifies the distribution of internal forces and its stiffness matrix. As a consequence, the global stiffness matrix is continuously modified at each plastic load step until it becomes singular. Numerical examples are furnished as validation tests of the program. The efficiency of the proposed model is demonstrated comparing the results with those available in literature...|$|R
500|$|The {{shell of}} the spiny scallop is {{slightly}} shaped like a fan {{and is able to}} grow to a height of about [...] though a more normal adult size is [...] The shell is composed of two valves, each of which is convex and has a small number of broad ribs covered with blunt spines. These radiate from the umbone, the rounded protuberance near the hinge, and between them are fine etched striations. The background colour is white with radial bands of pale purple and the right valve, which is usually underneath, is paler than the left. The annual growth rings are visible, often as concentric bands of a different hue. Beside the hinge are two irregular shell flaps or auricles with the anterior one normally being much larger than the other. This provides an attachment for the single strong adductor muscle that closes the shell. On either side of the long hinge there are some little ridges and grooves known as teeth. Their function is to prevent the valves moving sideways with regard to each other. Some bivalve shells have large [...] "cardinal" [...] teeth on the hinge immediately below the umbone, but the spiny scallop does not. Instead it has 5 or 6 lateral teeth lying {{on either side of the}} <b>hinge.</b> Lining the <b>inside</b> of the valves is the mantle, a membrane that covers the gut and other internal organs. It can be seen round the margins of the valves as a thick layer like a sandwich filling. It is fringed with numerous short tentacles and there is a row of tiny simple eyes close to each of the valves. The animal usually lies on its right valve and its exposed, left valve often has a colonial sponge growing on it.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Fabrication and Characterization of Torsional Micro-Hinge Structures Mike Marrujo There {{are many}} {{electronic}} devices that {{operate on the}} micrometer-scale such as Digital Micro-Mirror Devices (DMD). Micro actuators are a common type of DMD that employ a diaphragm supported by torsional hinges, which deform during actuation and are critical for the devices to have high stability and reliability. The stress developed within the hinge during actuation controls how the actuator will respond to the actuating force. Electrostatically driven micro actuators observe to have a fully recoverable non-linear viscoelastic response. The device consists of a micro-hinge which is suspended by two <b>hinges</b> that sits <b>inside</b> a micro machined well. To achieve a specific angle of rotation when actuated, the mechanical forces need to be characterized {{with a range of}} different forces applied {{to the edge of the}} micro-hinge. This research investigates the mechanical properties and the amount of force needed to rotate to specific angles by comparing theoretical performance to experimentally measured values. Characterizing the mechanical forces on the micro-hinge will further the understanding of how the device operates under a specific applied force. The material response to the amount of stress within the hinges will control the amount of actuation that is achieved by that force. The test devices were fabricated using common semiconductor fabrication techniques. The micro-hinge device was created on a 500 µm, double-sided polished, single crystal (100) silicon wafer. In order to create this device, both wet etching and dry etching techniques were employed to produce an 8 µm thick plate structure. The bulk etching of 480 µm was achieved by wet etching down into the silicon (Si) to create the wells. Dry etching was used for its high precision to release the micro-hinge structure. Once fabricated, the micro-hinge actuators were tested using a Technics turntable arm with a built in micrometer that applied a constant force while measuring the displacement of the actuator. The rotation of the hinge was measured by reflecting a Helium-Neon (HeNe) laser beam off a mirror, which is attached to the pivot of the arm that’s applying the force, and any type of displacement was recorded with a Photo Sensitive Device (PSD). The test stand applied a small force which replicated the amount of electrostatic forces needed to achieve a specific degree of rotation. Results indicate that the micro-hinge achieved a repeatable amount of rotation when forces were applied to it. The micro-hinge would endure deformation when too much force would be applied and yield a maximum amount of force allowed...|$|R
