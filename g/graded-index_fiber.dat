25|$|An {{optical fiber}} is a {{cylindrical}} dielectric waveguide (nonconducting waveguide) that transmits light along its axis, {{by the process}} of total internal reflection. The fiber consists of a core surrounded by a cladding layer, both of which are made of dielectric materials. To confine the optical signal in the core, the refractive index of the core must be greater than that of the cladding. The boundary between the core and cladding may either be abrupt, in step-index fiber, or gradual, in <b>graded-index</b> <b>fiber.</b>|$|E
25|$|In <b>graded-index</b> <b>fiber,</b> {{the index}} of {{refraction}} in the core decreases continuously between the axis and the cladding. This causes light rays to bend smoothly as they approach the cladding, rather than reflecting abruptly from the core-cladding boundary. The resulting curved paths reduce multi-path dispersion because high angle rays pass more through the lower-index periphery of the core, rather than the high-index center. The index profile is chosen to minimize the difference in axial propagation speeds of the various rays in the fiber. This ideal index profile {{is very close to}} a parabolic relationship between the index and the distance from the axis.|$|E

40|$|Solitons are non-dispersing {{localized}} {{waves that}} occur in diverse physical settings. A variety of optical solitons have been observed, but versions that involve both spatial and temporal degrees of freedom are rare. Optical fibers designed to support multiple transverse modes offer opportunities to study wave propagation in a setting that is intermediate between single-mode fiber and free-space propagation. Here we report the observation of optical solitons and soliton self-frequency shifting in <b>graded-index</b> multimode <b>fiber.</b> These wave packets can be modeled as multi-component solitons, or as solitons of the Gross-Pitaevskii equation.

40|$|A {{number of}} new {{approaches}} {{to the understanding of}} light wave propagation in cylindrical waveguides are described in this study. They include elaborations of known results on fibers with circular cross-section and a new formulation for the understanding of the propagation characteristics of dielectric waveguides with elliptical cross-section. ^ The first part is a presentation of a comprehensive review and comparison of the power series expansion and finite difference methods in solving the problem of propagation in cylindrical optical fibers. In particular, a comparison of the accuracy of both methods when calculating the cutoff frequencies of step-index fibers is made. Furthermore, an extension to <b>graded-index</b> <b>fibers</b> by both methods is also shown. ^ In the second part, a simple analytic expression is selected to approximate the propagation and delay time of rod waveguides. The explicit formulas yield very small errors in either extreme, i. e. near the cutoff frequency and far away from the cutoff frequency, thus providing much simplification in the estimation of certain optical properties of fibers. ^ The third section of the work presents a simple and accurate method to calculate the cutoff frequencies of an optical fiber with elliptical cross-section. This method is easy to implement in a computer program and is applicable to ellipses with any eccentricity. It also allows one to compare the variation of the cutoff frequencies of step-index dielectric waveguides for several differences in the refractive index for a waveguide whose walls are ideal conductors. Finally, the last portion of the research was devoted to extending these results to <b>graded-index</b> <b>fibers.</b> A simple and lucid method to calculate the cutoff frequencies of a <b>graded-index</b> optical <b>fiber</b> with elliptical cross-section is thus presented. The difference between the cutoff frequencies of step-index elliptical fibers and the corresponding cutoff frequencies of <b>graded-index</b> elliptical <b>fibers</b> is found to be relatively small for any given eccentricity. ...|$|R
40|$|Calculations are {{presented}} showing that, in general, a parabolic-index fiber is {{more sensitive to}} lateral misalignments within a splice than a step-index fiber.

40|$|The {{method of}} {{paraxial}} complex geometrical optics (PCGO) is presented, which describes Gaussian beam (GB) diffraction in smoothly inhomogeneous media of cylindrical symmetry, including fibers. PCGO reduces {{the problem of}} Gaussian beam diffraction in inhomogeneous media to {{the system of the}} first order ordinary differential equations for the complex curvature of the wave front and for GB amplitude, which can be readily solved both analytically and numerically. As a result, PCGO radically simplifies the description of Gaussian beam diffraction in inhomogeneous media as compared to the numerical methods of wave optics. For the paraxial on-axis Gaussian beam propagation in inhomogeneous fibers, we compare PCGO solutions with numerical results for finite differences beam propagation method (FD-BPM). The PCGO method is shown to provide over 100 -times higher rate of calculation than FD-BPM at comparable accuracy. This paper presents PCGO analytical solutions for width evolution of cylindrically symmetric GB in quadratic <b>graded-index</b> <b>fiber,</b> which is obtained in less complicated way comparing to the methods of wave optics.

40|$|Optical fibers allow {{a variety}} of spectroscopic sensing methods to be {{implemented}} in a single-ended backscattering geometry. Taking multimode fibers with surface-enhanced Raman scattering active tips as a model system, it is shown that the remote single-ended collection geometry can be relatively inefficient {{in comparison to the}} performance of the underlying sensor structure. Therefore the performance of the single-ended geometry has been compared to the analogous sensor structure on a nonguiding silica glass substrate. While part of the reduction in collection efficiency can be attributed to mismatches between the numerical aperture of the collection optics and that of the fiber, this study suggests that there can be an additional loss due to a mismatch between the confocal area of the collection optics and the area of the fiber core. This effect is most significant for high numerical aperture objectives. However, the collection efficiency is somewhat higher than would be expected from a simple area ratio analysis.
