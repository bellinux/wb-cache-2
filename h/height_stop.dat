40|$|Limitations to {{broadleaf}} weed management {{options in}} chickpea present obstacles for stable production. Even with low weed incidence, chickpea yield can be severely affected, creating {{need for an}} integrated weed management system. Due to zero-tillage commonly practiced in Saskatchewan, there is heavy reliance on herbicides. The chickpea breeding program at the Crop Development Centre, University of Saskatchewan, has developed chickpea cultivars with resistance to imidazolinone (IMI) class of herbicides. The objectives of this study were: (i) to examine the reaction of four chickpea cultivars – CDC Luna, CDC Corinne, CDC Alma, and CDC Cory - to imazamox, imazethapyr, and a combination of imazamox and imazethapyr under field conditions; and (ii) to examine cultivar responses to IMI applications at different growth stages: 2 - 4 node, 5 - 8 node, and 9 - 12 node stage. Field experiments were conducted over five site years in Saskatchewan, Canada in 2012 and 2013. For each experiment, visual injury ratings, plant height, node, and internode length were recorded at 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after each herbicide application (DAA). Days to flowering (DTF), days to maturity (DTM), number of primary branches, pods per plant, harvest index, and seed yield were additional measurements for elucidating physiological responses. Conventional cultivars, CDC Luna and CDC Corinne, had moderate to severe visual injury scores compared to resistant cultivars, CDC Alma and CDC Cory, with minimal to no visual injury after IMI treatment. <b>Height</b> <b>stopped</b> increasing and node development slowed for conventional cultivars treated with IMI herbicides. This susceptibility to IMI herbicides was also recognized with a delay in the DTF and DTM. Despite significant negative response, CDC Luna and CDC Corinne were able to recover throughout the field season, resulting in no yield loss from IMI treatments. Resistant cultivars CDC Alma and CDC Cory demonstrated no negative response from IMI herbicide application compared with the untreated controls. Growth, in terms of height and node development, DTF, DTM, and yield {{were not significantly different}} between IMI treated and control treatments. Resistant cultivars tolerated IMI herbicide at all growth stages tested.

The concentrations of cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, urea, total protein and glucose were measured for spectrophotometric using the enzyme-colorimetric technique in plasma.

The concentration of triglycerides was 12. 61 ± 6. 91 vs. 16. 19 ± 8. 86 mg/dl (MGA and control), no trend in the first 20 days and from day 25 there was an increase compared to the average of the previous days.

40|$|ABSTRACT Several {{aspects of}} {{research}} on secular trends in growth, matur-ity status and physical performance are reviewed with a primary focus upon data for the United States, Europe and Japan. Increases in height and weight during childhood and adolescence, reductions in the age at menarche, and in-creases in adult stature have occurred over several generations in Europe, Ja-pan and United States. Secular trends in <b>height</b> have <b>stopped</b> in many devel-oped countries while weight has continued to increase, resulting in a secular increase in overweight and obesity as indicated in the BMI. Data for body pro-portions are less extensive, but suggest proportionally larger increases in leg length. Corresponding trends have occurred in other developed countries (e. g., Canada, Australia, Taiwan), {{and to a lesser}} extent in many developing coun-tries. Secular improvements in selected measures of static strength and motor performance during the last century are generally proportional to increases in body size. More recent comparisons over shorter time intervals yield more variable results and indicate changes independent of body size and more related to indicators of lifestyle, specifically changes in school programs, re-duced physical activity and increased television and video games...|$|R
