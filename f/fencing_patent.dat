40|$|In {{my thesis}} I develop a {{theoretical}} model of interdependent choices and an estimation strategy which I apply to model patent renewal. The {{model and the}} estimation are not confined to my application, but rather can have other applications in which firms or people are making strategic and simultaneous decisions. Chapter 1 is the introduction which contains {{a brief description of}} the structure of the thesis. Chapter 2 provides a literature review of studies that have focused on spatial dependence with discrete choice dependent variables; recent contributions include Pinkse and Slade (1998), LeSage (2000), Kelejian and Prucha (2001), Beron and Vijverberg (2004), and Wang et al. (2009). A major difficulty in the estimation of spatially dependent discrete choice models is computational intensity. Chapter 3 is a Monte Carlo study that investigates the small sample properties of an estimator for spatially dependent discrete choice models which is computationally simple. The analogue of a linear probability can be formulated as a spatial autoregressive Cliff and Ord (1973, 1981) -type model. The sets of Monte Carlo experiments show that the parameters of the model can be estimated without bias using a spatial 2 SLS estimator. Chapter 4 is a study is on the determinants of patent renewal, using US patents for Computer Hardware and Software granted between 1994 and 1997. Patent protection is important in that it encourages innovation by allowing firms to rely on patents to appropriate the returns to their R&D efforts. Returns to patents are modeled to depend on the firm's willingness to pay the patent renewal fees by, e. g., Harhoff et al. (2003), Serrano (2006), and Bessen (2008, 2009), and typically ignored potential interdependences in the decision making. Liu et al. (2008) showed that patent renewal was more likely if the patent was part of a firm's sequence of citing patents. I elaborate on their result and formulate a model in which the decision to renew a patent is dependent on the decisions of other firms to renew technologically similar patents. The theoretical model implies for the probability to renew a patent to depend on the probabilities to renew other patents, where the extent of interdependence is modeled based on a measure of similarity for patents. By making use of the estimation strategy from Chapter 3, I find that indeed the decision to renew a patent is dependent on the decision to renew related patents. Results in the literature which ignored this interdependence may hence suffer from specification biases. One plausible explanation for the interdependence I find is defensive patenting in the form of patent <b>fencing,</b> <b>patent</b> blocking and patent thickets. In the latter case, litigation and negotiation can impose high costs to society and their anticipation can lead to a hold up problem, which could deter investment in R&D...|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of a novel data set of 612 European patents and related inventions from five {{different}} industries, it is shown that multiple patents per invention are filed in both discrete and complex technologies. Multivariate analysis of the data suggests that in selected discrete technologies, patent 'fences' may serve to exclude competitors whereas in complex technologies, 'thickets' represent exchange forums for complementary technology. The results expand on traditional views of profitable patent exploitation across industries and elaborate on the most recent findings by Cohen et al. (Cohen, W. M., Nelson, R. R. and Walsh, J. P. (2000) Protecting Their Intellectual Assets: Appropriability Conditions and Why U. S. Manufacturing Firms Patent (or not). Cambridge, MA: NBER.) The analysis suggests that different legislative issues arise from multiple patenting per innovation in complex and discrete technologies depending on the degree of technological complementarity. The results have unexpected policy implications in that they illustrate how patentees could eliminate competition in the form of substitute technologies through fencing. They have wide managerial implications regarding the valuation of patent portfolios and the design of corporate IP strategies. <b>Patent</b> thicket, <b>Patent</b> <b>fence,</b> Invention value, <b>Patent</b> use, Patenting strategies,...|$|R
40|$|On November 24, 1874, United States Patent No. 157, 124 {{was granted}} to Joseph Glidden of DeKalb, Ill., for {{improved}} barbed wire <b>fencing.</b> Glidden’s <b>patent</b> was {{the culmination of}} a series of nine patents for improvements to wire fencing that were granted by the U. S. Patent Offi ce to American inventors, beginning with Michael Kelly in November 1868 and ending with Glidden’s patent (McCallum and McCallum, 1965), which quickly became dominant. To be sure, wire fencing had been used for a very long time. However, property rights over livestock were less secure, as wire fencing would often break under the impact of heavy livestock pressing against the fencing. This would not happen with barbed wire, so the costs at which property rights to livestock could be protected fell dramatically (Dennen, 1976; Anderson and Hill, 2004) ...|$|R
5000|$|An early {{application}} of the electric fence for livestock control was developed in 1936 - 1937 by New Zealand inventor Bill Gallagher. Built from a car ignition trembler coil set, Gallagher used the device to keep his horse from scratching itself against his car. Gallagher later started the Gallagher Group to improve and market the design. In 1962, another New Zealand inventor, Doug Phillips, invented the non-shortable electric fence based on capacitor discharge. This significantly increased the range an electric fence could be used from a few hundred metres to 35 km (~20 miles), and reduced the cost of fencing by more than 80%. The non-shortable electric <b>fence</b> was <b>patented</b> by Phillips and by 1964 was manufactured by Plastic Products, a New Zealand firm, under the name [...] "Waikato Electric Fence." [...] This idea was to replace ceramic with plastic insulators. A variety of plastic insulators are now used on farms throughout the world today.|$|R
40|$|Today {{most of a}} firm's {{value is}} {{composed}} of its intangible assets. Patents as one type of intangible assets {{play a crucial role}} for technology oriented firms since they help preventing imitation of the firms' products. Therefore, valuing patents from a management science perspective plays an important role. Up to now the value of individual patents or patent portfolios has been estimated assuming that patents possess an individual and separable value, which would ultimately imply that the value of a patent portfolio consists of the sum of the individual patents' values. This however, contradicts different patent management strategies that rely on interdependencies between individual <b>patents,</b> for instance <b>fencing</b> important <b>patents</b> by additional property rights, or surrounding patents from competitors in order to limit their freedom to operate. Therefore, interdependencies between individual patents should have an impact on patent and patent portfolio values. In this contribution a dataset from biotechnology and pharmaceutical firms is used. It is investigated by means of established indicators from information science if interdependencies between patents, controlling for several other indicators, in fact have an impact on portfolio value. In advance, several studies were conducted that aimed to:a) demonstrate the status quo of patent analysis,b) investigate the usefulness of several patentometric value indicators empirically,c) investigate several text-mining approaches that can be employed to measure similarities and thus, interdependencies, between documents, andd) determine time-intervals between patent applications and finally, their impact on portfolio value. It could be shown that patent clusters within a firm that may represent <b>patent</b> <b>fencing</b> strategies - ultimately representing interdependencies - that have a significant and positive effect on portfolio value. This could mean that current patent portfolio valuation methodologies should be reconsidered in the future...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the value}} of patent information to lenders who lend to patenting firms. In particular, it investigates differences in how a firmâs patent stock is valued by lenders {{due to differences in}} industry and product technology. The data sample used contains information on loans to patenting firms in the U. S. over the period 1987 to 2007 and incorporates information on patents granted from 1963 to 2007. It is well documented that the use of patents differs significantly across industries and product technological class. Previous research has shown that firms in industries classified as having discrete technologies, such as chemicals, drugs, and textiles, are more likely to employ patents for the direct purposes of preventing copying, licensing and protecting core inventions via <b>patent</b> <b>fencing,</b> while firms in industries classified as having complex technologies, such as computers, electronics and communications, are more likely to use patents for negotiations in cross-licensing agreements and for the prevention of suits. The empirical findings of this thesis support some, but not all of the hypotheses regarding the predicted effect of patenting on loan spreads and how certain characteristics might influence this relationship. In particular, results show that not all firms benefit universally from having higher patent stock. Instead, results support the prediction that lenders take into account a firmâs industry, and the context of how patents are generally used in that industry, when pricing loans and attributing value to a firmâs patent stock. Results also support the prediction that lenders value the patenting stock of discrete technology firms above that of complex technology firms, and this relationship is found to be enhanced for smaller firms, younger firms, and those firms with lower levels of fixed-asset tangibility. Evidence appears to support the case that where lenders value patents, they do so because {{the context in which the}} patents are used enables them to effectively reduce information asymmetries. Some patenting contexts, however, are not conducive to reducing information asymmetries, and therefore lenders do not ascribe positive value to additional patents used in this way...|$|R
40|$|The {{intellectual}} property rights (IPR) appropriation from the company’s perspective is, first of all, associated with coordinated actions on obtaining and enforcing of the respective {{intellectual property}} rights, such as patents, utility models, industrial designs, trademarks, copyright and trade secrets. In developed economies with strong intellectual property (IP) systems companies traditionally rely on registered IPRs. Patents are regarded in general as the most valuable IPRs. Nevertheless, a single patent does not provide the holder with an unlimited right to use the technology, and does not exclude the risk of competitors inventing around the patent. To address these uncertainties of single patent rights, companies deploy various strategies with regard to obtaining and enforcing patents such as building <b>patent</b> <b>fences,</b> defensive blockages, defensive thickets, strategic patenting etc. The patent protection is limited to 20 years from its filing date, whereas the trademark protection may last forever. A strong branding can, for example, have {{a positive influence on}} sales revenue and market value. Firms may file trademark litigation when they are targeted by patent enforcement. However, not every national IP system and not every IP related law can guarantee an optimal appropriation level of the intangible assets a company may desire. The imperfections of an IP environment, especially in emerging economies, should encourage the companies’ skilled managers to seek for additional and/or alternative ways to enhance the appropriation of their intangible assets. Such ways can be described as management approaches – strategies developed by managers in order to prevent the abuse of their companies’ IP rights or enhance their obtaining and enforcement via legal means. Previous research provides some evidence that companies’ management may deploy some approaches to deal with IP system imperfections and further enhance IP appropriation. Such approaches known from the previous research can be divided into two categories: either aimed to prevent the IP infringement, or to enhance the conventional IP appropriation via rights obtaining and enforcement. The existing literature on the “enhancing” approaches in weak IP systems is scarce and provides some insights mainly in the trademark enforcement area however not focusing on a certain IP right. The current controversies of China’s emerging IP system that serves as a research context for this dissertation, combined with its ascending patent surge and high attractiveness of its market, suggest a challenging environment which motivates managers to develop and deploy various approaches to attain an optimal level of IP appropriation. The assumptions of this dissertation are, therefore, that (1) management at multi-national companies (MNCs) that are actively protecting their IPR, should have advanced old or create new approaches toward IPR appropriation in response to challenges and opportunities caused by China’s new leap in advancing its IP system and (2) there could be perspective areas where such approaches could be created and deployed. The present dissertation gives an alternative perspective on the IP management by focusing on the management approaches aimed to enhance the conventional IPR appropriation as well as potential areas where such approaches could be developed and implemented. It uses pragmatic approach, meaning that different methods or combination of methods were deployed at different stages of the research depending on the available knowledge from the previous studies and opportunities for the data collection. This dissertation is based on the unique data provided by seven multi-national companies with a long-term experience of production, R&D and sales in China. All the data were collected by me in a close cooperation with companies’ IP and R&D managers, patent and trademark attorneys and engineers. An exploratory qualitative approach was chosen for the first article of the present dissertation. This work investigates management approaches in four IP appropriation domains: patent rights obtaining, patent rights enforcement, trademark rights obtaining and trademark right enforcement. This study deploys the multiple case study research method and uses an inductive logic. The purpose of the following two studies was to get deeper insights in one IP appropriation domain – patent rights obtaining. The findings of the first article suggested that the management attempts to enhance the patent rights obtaining, via improving the patent awareness of the engineers. This became the research topic of the second article of the present dissertation. While making the literature research and conducting the preliminary qualitative research, it became obvious that besides patent awareness there is another dimension that shapes the patenting behavior of the engineers – the patenting motivation. Therefore the third study was undertaken to shed some light on this phenomenon. The data for both studies were collected at multi-national engineering company’s R&D centers in China via survey (a structured questionnaire). I used multiple hierarchical regression method for the second study and a combination of methods (factor analysis, one-way repeated ANOVA and robust multiple hierarchical regression) for the third one. MNCs skillful managers develop and deploy various and complex approaches to enhance their IP appropriation. Findings of the first article reveal eleven management techniques that differ in the application area (i. e. internal or external) and context (either aimed to improve IP awareness or to establish cooperation on the IP protection issues). The discussion also shows the applicability of some explored management approaches for other industries and their double role to also prevent infringement. The findings of the second study suggest that management can influence engineers’ patent awareness. Invention disclosure experience, use of patent literature, supervisory encouragement and patent trainings show {{a significant impact on the}} engineers’ patent awareness, whereas the effect of patent attorney consultancy is probably mitigated by invention disclosure experience. The discussion suggests a potential effect the managerial factors may have on the individual ones. The third article of the dissertation revealed a complex nature of engineers’ patenting motivation. The study explored four types of patenting motivation: recognition and reward, reputation and promotion, making a contribution and interest and sense of achievement. The results of multiple hierarchical regression show a positive impact of working climate on “making a contribution” and “interest and sense of achievement” motivation factors, but no influence of patent awareness and management encouragement on any of the motivation factors. The results of this doctoral thesis have some managerial implications. First, the management approaches revealed in the first study can be adopted in a wider range of industries. Furthermore, these strategies provide such benefits as saving of enforcement costs, exchange the experience with other experts from the industry and influence the further development of the country’s IP regime. Local IP management and its cultural competence play a crucial role in the success of these management approaches. Financial considerations must be taken into account. Second, management has many ways to influence engineers’ patenting behavior. As shown in the second paper of this dissertation the managerial and individual factors show high significant positive correlations. This means, that managers could potentially influence the engineers’ attitude toward using patent literature or make them put some extra efforts to transform their ideas into patentable inventions. Finally, the third study of the dissertation revealed a complex nature of the patenting motivation of the corporate R&D engineers. Same as general working motivation, patenting motivation should vary as a function of different factors in the working environment. R&D management should learn to understand and manage the patenting motivation effectively to achieve their internal targets on patent disclosures and through that enhance their companies’ competitive advantage. Die Appropriation der geistigen Eigentumsrechte (IPR) ist aus der Sicht des Unternehmens vor allem mit koordinierten Maßnahmen zur Erlangung und Durchsetzung der jeweiligen IPRs wie Patente, Gebrauchsmuster, Industriedesigns, Marken, Urheberrechte und Geschäftsgeheimnisse verbunden. In entwickelten Volkswirtschaften mit starken IP-Systemen setzen Unternehmen traditionell auf registrierte IPRs. Patente gelten im Allgemeinen als die wertvollsten IPRs. Dennoch stellt ein einziges Patent dem Inhaber kein unbegrenztes Recht zur Nutzung der Technologie zur Verfügung und schließt das Risiko, dass Wettbewerber das Patent umgehen, nicht aus. Um diesen Unsicherheiten einzelner Patentrechte zu begegnen, setzen Unternehmen verschiedene Strategien ein, um Patente zu erwerben und durchzusetzen, wie zum Beispiel die Erstellung von Patentschirmen, defensive Blockaden, defensive Patent-„Dickichte“, strategische Patentierung usw. Der Patentschutz ist auf 20 Jahre ab dem Anmeldetag beschränkt, während der Markenschutz grundsätzlich für immer bestehen kann. Ein starkes Branding kann zum Beispiel den Firmenumsatz und Marktwert positiv beeinflussen. Im Falle einer Patentverletzungsklage kann eine Markenschutzklage eine potentielle Gegenmaßnahme darstellen. Allerdings kann nicht jedes nationale IP-System und nicht jedes IP-rechtliche Gesetz eine optimale Appropriation der immateriellen Vermögenswerte, die ein Unternehmen wünscht, garantieren. Die Unzulänglichkeiten eines IP-Umfelds, vor allem in Schwellenländern, sollten die Führungskräfte der Unternehmen dazu ermutigen, zusätzliche und / oder alternative Wege zur Verbesserung der Appropriation ihrer immateriellen Vermögenswerte zu suchen.|$|R
