40|$|The {{theory of}} {{evolutionarily}} stable strategies (ESS) predicts the long-term evolutionary outcome of frequency-dependent selection {{by making a}} number of simplifying assumptions about the genetic basis of inheritance. I use a symmetrized multilocus model of quantitative inheritance without mutation to analyze the results of interactions between pairs of related individuals and compare the equilibria to those found by <b>ESS</b> <b>analysis.</b> It is assumed that the fitness changes due to interactions can be approximated by the exponential of a quadratic surface. The major results are the following. (1) The evolutionarily stable phenotypes found by <b>ESS</b> <b>analysis</b> are always equilibria of the model studied here. (2) When relatives interact, {{one of the two}} conditions for stability of equilibria differs between the two models; this can be accounted for by positing that the inclusive fitness function for quantitative characters is slightly different from the inclusive fitness function for characters determined by a single locus. (3) The inclusion of environmental variance will in general change the equilibrium phenotype, but the equilibria of <b>ESS</b> <b>analysis</b> are changed to the same extent by environmental variance. (4) A class of genetically polymorphic equilibria occur, which in the present model are always unstable. These results expand the range of conditions under which one can validly predict the evolution of pairwise interactions using <b>ESS</b> <b>analysis...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{small-scale}} {{statistics of}} orificed, perforated plate (OPP) turbulence was studied over a rangeofReynoldsnumbers basedonTaylormicroscale,Reλ, from 23 to 108. The streamwise velocity skewness, flatness, and the velocity spectra, deduced fromhot-wiremeasurements taken at 70 D (where D is {{the diameter of}} the holes of the OPP) downstream of the OPP confirmed the turbulence to be quasi-isotropic. Application of the extended self-similarity concept enabled the analysis of the velocity structure functions of the small-scale statistics up to the sixth order. The <b>ESS</b> <b>analysis</b> revealed a large stretch of scaling region, despite the absence of a perceptible Kolmogorov inertial subrange. The values of the scaling exponents seem to affirm the superiority of the OPP over conventional grid in generating quasi-isotropic turbulence. The effects of Reλ on the extent of the scaling range and the scaling exponent were also explored...|$|R
40|$|Should {{attractive}} fathers {{have more}} sons? According to widespread verbal arguments, {{the answer is}} in the affirma-tive, but formal models are lacking. We investigate the question {{by means of an}} <b>ESS</b> <b>analysis</b> of sexual selection and sex ratio selection. The {{purpose of this paper is}} twofold: firstly, we show how an ESS approach can be used to model the coevolution of female mate choice and male secondary sexual traits. In the ESS approach, the genetic covariances of traditional genetic models of sexual selection are replaced by covariances between strategies. In com-parison with population genetic and quantitative genetic models of sexual selection, the ESS approach is simpler and yields more insight in the underlying selective forces. Secondly, we show that whether attractive fathers should have more sons depends on the mechanism of sexual selection: sexual selection driven by the Fisherian runaway process alone, without costs of choosiness, does not select for sex ratio specialization according to paternal attractiveness, but the good-genes process causes selection to favor such specialization...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} an interactive analyzer for the generative theory of tonal music (GTTM). Generally, {{a piece of}} music has more than one interpretation, and dealing with such ambiguity {{is one of the major}} problems when constructing a music analysis system.

The ATTA has adjustable parameters that enable the analyzer to generate multiple <b>analysis</b> <b>results.</b> As the ATTA cannot output all the <b>analysis</b> <b>results</b> that correspond to all the interpretations of {{a piece of music}}, we designed a GTTM manual editor, which generates all the <b>analysis</b> <b>results.</b> Experimental results showed that our interactive GTTM analyzer outperformed the GTTM manual editor without an ATTA.

40|$|Abstract. Source-to-source {{analysis}} aims at {{supporting the}} reuse of <b>analysis</b> <b>results</b> similar to code reuse. The reuse of program code {{is a common}} technique which attempts to {{save time and costs}} by reducing redundant work. We want to avoid re-analyzing parts of a software system, such as library code. In the ideal case the <b>analysis</b> <b>results</b> are directly associated with the program itself. Source-to-source analysis supports this through program annotations. Further more, to get the best out of available software analysis tools, we aim at enabling the combination of the <b>analysis</b> <b>results</b> of different tools. In order to allow this, tools must be able to process another tool’s <b>analysis</b> <b>results.</b> This enables numerous applications such as automatic annotation of interfaces, testing of analyses by checking the <b>results</b> of an <b>analysis</b> against provided annotations, domain aware analysis by utilizing domain-specific program annotations, and making <b>analysis</b> <b>results</b> persistent as annotations in source code. The design of the Static Analysis Tool Integration Engine (SATIrE [6]) allows to map source code annotations to its intermediate program representation as well as generating source code annotations from <b>analysis</b> <b>results</b> that are attached to the intermediate representation. The technical challenges are the design of the analysis information annotation language, the bidirectional propagation of the analysis information through different phases of the internal translation processes, and the combination of the different analyses through the plug-in mechanism. In its current version SATIrE targets C/C++ programs. In this paper we present the approach of source-to-source analysis and show in a detailed example analysis how we support this approach in SATIrE. ...|$|R
