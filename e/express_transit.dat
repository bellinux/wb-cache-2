25|$|Proposals {{to build}} a light rail (tram) line through the town {{as part of an}} {{extension}} to the Nottingham <b>Express</b> <b>Transit</b> system were approved by the Government in 2009. A motivation was the traffic jams on local roads during rush hour periods. There was some opposition to the scheme by local traders and those along the proposed route, who stated that they feared that during the construction work, business would be adversely affected and that the scheme was being imposed without concern for locals. However, a survey in 2004 by Nottingham <b>Express</b> <b>Transit</b> showed strong local support for the scheme. The line opened on 25 August 2015.|$|E
25|$|The City site {{benefited from}} the {{completion}} of the Nottingham <b>Express</b> <b>Transit</b> (NET) light rail system in December 2003, which provides a tram stop outside the Boots Library. This allows a direct link to Nottingham city's main railway station.|$|E

25|$|With {{the opening}} of the Nottingham <b>Express</b> <b>Transit</b> (NET) in March 2004, Nottingham station became the {{southern}} terminus of the new tram line. The actual tram stop was located on Station Street, directly north of Nottingham railway station and partially over the Nottingham Canal, and was constructed on a separate right-of-way, built on top of part of the old Great Central Main Line viaduct that used to lead northwards to the separate Nottingham Victoria railway station. To the north of the former stop, the tram route diverged from the old railway route, to join an on-street section through the centre of Nottingham. To the south the route ended {{at the end of the}} viaduct, where a since demolished bridge used to carry the Great Central line over the station. In 2012 work started to extend Nottingham <b>Express</b> <b>Transit</b> south towards Toton Lane and Clifton South.|$|E
25|$|The {{station was}} first {{built by the}} Midland Railway in 1848, and rebuilt by them in 1904, {{with much of the}} current {{building}} dating from that later date. It is now owned by Network Rail but managed by East Midlands Trains. Besides trains of that company, it is also served by CrossCountry and Northern trains, and by Nottingham <b>Express</b> <b>Transit</b> (NET) trams.|$|E
25|$|Beeston {{is served}} by the Nottingham <b>Express</b> <b>Transit</b> tram system, which links it to Nottingham city centre and other local destinations.

25|$|Most of {{the tram}} networks, {{with a few}} {{exceptions}} (notably Blackpool) closed before the 1960s. The last to close was Glasgow Corporation Tramways in 1962, a tramway well represented at the museum. There has been a recent revival in the use of trams, with new networks opened including Croydon Tramlink, Sheffield Supertram, Midland Metro, Edinburgh Trams, Manchester Metrolink and the nearby Nottingham <b>Express</b> <b>Transit</b> being built and extended.|$|E

25|$|North of Ruddington, {{and as far}} as Nottingham, {{sections}} of the GCML right of way are used by the Nottingham <b>Express</b> <b>Transit</b> (NET), Nottingham's second generation tramway. The first section is north from Ruddington Lane tram stop as far as the River Trent, used by the 2015-opened line 2 of NET. North of the river the Great Central route was eliminated by housing development in the 1970s, and the tramway uses a different route across the river and north to Nottingham railway station (the former Midland station). The GCML crossed above this on a bridge, and NET uses the same alignment to provide a tram stop at the station before transitioning back to the city streets. North of here the GCML route is blocked by the Victoria shopping centre, built {{on the site of the}} GCR's Nottingham station.|$|E

The two tram lines run in both directions, skirting {{around the edge of}} the main square from Market Street in the north west and along South Parade towards Hockley. The Market Square was once at the heart of the city's road network; today it is closed to all traffic except buses along Beast Market Hill and the tram.|$|R

25|$|In the United Kingdom, {{investment}} in public transport {{in the late}} 1980s turned to light rail {{as an alternative to}} more costly underground railway solutions, {{with the opening of the}} Tyne and Wear Metro (1980) and the Docklands Light Railway in London (1987) systems. However, the first British city to reintroduce on-street trams was Manchester, with the opening of its Metrolink network in 1992. Several other UK cities followed with their own modern tram systems, including Sheffield (Supertram, opened 1994), Birmingham and Wolverhampton (Midland Metro, opened 1999), London (London Tramlink, opened 2000) and Nottingham (Nottingham <b>Express</b> <b>Transit,</b> opened 2004). Many of these tram cities are planning or building network extensions (construction is in progress in Manchester, Nottingham and Birmingham/Wolverhampton) and several more tram systems are being proposed or are under construction, such as Edinburgh Trams, Belfast EWAY (proposed) and Liverpool Merseytram (proposed). Other tramway projects have not made it beyond the proposal stage because of funding problems, for example London's Cross River Tram and the Leeds Supertram, which is now to be a trolleybus system.|$|E

25|$|In {{order to}} {{facilitate}} the Nottingham <b>Express</b> <b>Transit's</b> phase two extension into {{the south of the}} city, it was planned to have the tram line cross the station on the line of the original Great Central Railway viaduct that had been closed to passenger trains in 1967 and goods in 1973. This would involve a bridge, crossing from the existing Station Street stop, which would close, over both the station and Queen's Road. A replacement tram stop would be sited on the bridge.|$|R
