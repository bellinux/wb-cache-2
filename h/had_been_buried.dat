5|$|Home Army {{arms and}} {{equipment}} came mostly from four sources: arms that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> by the Polish armies on battlefields after the 1939 invasion of Poland; arms purchased or captured from the Germans and their allies; arms clandestinely manufactured by the Home Army itself; and arms received from Allied air drops.|$|E
5|$|Menkauhor Kaiu built {{a pyramid}} in North-Saqqara, thereby abandoning the royal {{necropolis}} of Abusir, where kings of the Fifth Dynasty <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> since {{the reign of}} Sahure, some 80 years earlier. The reason for this choice {{may be that the}} Abusir plateau had become overcrowded by the beginning of Menkauhor's reign.|$|E

5|$|From arms caches {{hidden in}} 1939, the Home Army obtained: 614 heavy machine guns, 1,193 light machine guns, 33,052 rifles, 6,732 pistols, 28 antitank light field guns, 25 antitank rifles, and 43,154 hand grenades. However, {{due to their}} {{inadequate}} preservation, which had had to be improvised in {{the chaos of the}} September Campaign, most of the guns were in poor condition. Of those that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> in the ground and had been dug up in 1944 during preparations for Operation Tempest, only 30% were usable.|$|E

5|$|In 1866 Indianapolis's Crown Hill National Cemetery was {{established}} within {{the grounds of}} Crown Hill Cemetery, a privately owned cemetery northwest of downtown.

5|$|Some of Wallace's friends {{suggested}} that he be buried in Westminster Abbey, but his wife followed his wishes and had him buried in the small cemetery at Broadstone, Dorset. Several prominent British scientists formed a committee to have a medallion of Wallace placed in Westminster Abbey near where Darwin <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>buried.</b> The medallion was unveiled on 1 November 1915.|$|E
5|$|The ten colossal heads from San Lorenzo {{originally}} formed two roughly {{parallel lines}} running north-south across the site. Although some were recovered from ravines, {{they were found}} close to their original placements and <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> by local erosion. These heads, together {{with a number of}} monumental stone thrones, probably formed a processional route across the site, powerfully displaying its dynastic history. Two of the San Lorenzo heads had been re-carved from older thrones.|$|E
5|$|Carbon dating {{carried out}} at the University of Edinburgh dated the skull to between 1650 and 1880, while {{the fact that it}} had been {{deposited}} on top of a layer of Victorian tiles suggested that it belonged to the end of this era. The skull had fracture marks consistent with Webster's account of throwing Thomas down the stairs, and it was found to have low collagen levels, consistent with it being boiled. In July 2011, the coroner concluded that the skull was indeed that of Thomas. DNA testing was not possible as she had died childless and no relatives could be traced; in addition, there was no record of where the rest of her body <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>buried.</b>|$|E

5|$|Following the {{demolition}} of the tomb's chamber, some of the sarsens around the monument <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>buried,</b> while others had been left visible. Various buildings in Addington are partly made out of sarsen stone, {{some of which may}} have been removed from the long barrow. Ashbee also suspected that sarsens from this monument had been broken up for use in the repairs and extensions to the local church in the nineteenth century. The barrow was further damaged by the construction of the small road running through the middle of it.|$|E
5|$|Grave {{artifacts}} from dirt domes excavated in the 1980s along the Illinois River revealed a complete {{skeleton of a}} young bobcat along with a collar made of bone pendants and shell beads that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> by the Hopewell culture. The type and place of burial indicate a tamed and cherished pet or possible spiritual significance. The Hopewell normally buried their dogs, so the bones were initially identified as remains of a puppy, but dogs were usually buried close to the village {{and not in the}} mounts themselves. This is the only wild cat decorated burial on the archaeological record.|$|E
5|$|In September 1937 the German {{government}} again {{requested that}} Lody's body be exhumed {{and moved to}} a separate grave. This proved impractical for several reasons; he <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> with seven other men, each coffin had been cemented down and the lapse of time would make identification very difficult. Instead, the British Imperial War Graves Commission suggested that a memorial should be constructed {{in another part of the}} cemetery to bear the names of all the German civilians who were buried there. The proposal met with German agreement and the memorial was duly installed. During the Second World War, Lody's original headstone was destroyed by misaimed Luftwaffe bombs. It was replaced in 1974.|$|E

5|$|Jefferson Davis Hospital began {{operations}} in 1924 {{and was the}} first centralized municipal hospital to treat indigent patients in Houston, Texas.

The hospital was named for Jefferson Davis, former president of the Confederacy, in honor of the Confederate soldiers who <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> in the cemetery and as a means to console the families of the deceased.|$|E
5|$|On 16 September 2008, {{the body}} of British {{politician}} and diplomat Sir Mark Sykes was exhumed to study the RNA of the flu virus in efforts to understand the genetic structure of modern H5N1 bird flu. Sykes <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> in 1919 in a lead coffin which scientists hoped had helped preserve the virus. However, the coffin {{was found to be}} split because of the weight of soil over it, and the cadaver was badly decomposed. Nonetheless, samples of lung and brain tissue were taken through the split, with the coffin remaining in situ in the grave during this process.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of Gaddafi's death, NTC Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril publicly revealed the news. Gaddafi's corpse {{was placed in the}} freezer of a local market alongside the corpses of Yunis Jabr and Mutassim; the bodies were publicly displayed for four days, with Libyans {{from all over the country}} coming to view them. In response to international calls, on 24 October Jibril announced that a commission would investigate Gaddafi's death. On 25 October, the NTC announced that Gaddafi <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>buried</b> at an unidentified location in the desert. Seeking vengeance for the killing, Gaddafist sympathizers fatally wounded one of those who had captured Gaddafi, Omran Shaaban, near Bani Walid in September 2012.|$|E
