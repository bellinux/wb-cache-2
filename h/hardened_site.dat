40|$|Regional {{and global}} geopark {{networks}} are rapidly expanding internationally. A key impetus for their establishment is local community development through geotourism, or tourism {{that is based}} on sites of geological interest. Geotourism can be a powerful tool for sustainable development but, if not managed effectively, can constitute a direct threat to geoheritage resources. This paper articulates the characteristics and challenges of geotourism by examining two iconic geosites in Taiwan and Australia. Management challenges of Yehliu Geopark (Taiwan) are many, the most prominent ones being congestion, depreciative visitor behaviour and excessive management footprint. Depreciative behaviour is also a significant challenge to Pinnacles Desert (Australia), though congestion is not yet an imminent problem. These two cases illustrate that achieving sustainable visitor use at iconic geosites can be challenging despite the presence of infrastructure, <b>site</b> <b>hardening</b> and interpretation.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the recreational and natural heritage of Penguin Island in its journey from {{use as a}} recreation reserve to its current management within a Class A biodiversity conservation reserve. Protected natural areas were historically managed for tourism and recreation, resulting in a significant heritage of use.

Visitors to natural areas are considered a prime audience to raise awareness about biodiversity protection but Australia has a poor record of integrating cultural and natural heritage management. The long heritage of recreation use on Penguin Island was superimposed with a biodiversity protection mandate. Effective design based on minimal <b>site</b> <b>hardening</b> and selective restriction of recreational use, rather than education, has successfully restored island’s natural heritage. However, the island’s cultural heritage has been obscured.

40|$|Beauveria brongniartii (Saccardo) Petch {{fungal infections}} were {{observed}} on the melolonthid Hypopholis sommeri Burmeister (Coleoptera: Scarabaeidae) at two <b>sites</b> (<b>Harden</b> Heights and Canema) in the sugarcane producing {{area of the}} northern KwaZulu-Natal Midlands of South Africa. To initially identify the disease-causing fungus, 17 different fluorescently-labelled microsatellite PCR primers were used to target 78 isolates of Beauveria spp. DNA. Microsatellite data resolved two distinct clusters of Beauveria isolates which represented the Beauveria bassiana s. s. (Balsamo) Vuillemin (17 isolates) and B. brongniartii (60 isolates) species groups. These groupings were supported by two gene regions, the nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) and the nuclear Bloc gene of which 23 exemplar Beauveria isolates were represented and sequenced. When microsatellite data were analysed, 26 haplotypes among 58 isolates of B. brongniartii were distinguished. Relatively low levels of genetic diversity were detected in B. brongniartii and isolates were shown to be closely related. No genetic differentiation was observed between the Harden Heights and Canema populations; they thus may be considered one, structured and fragmented population over a distance of 5. 5 km. Historically high levels of gene flow from swarming H. sommeri beetles is the proposed mechanism for this observed lack of genetic differentiation between populations. Microsatellite analyses also showed that B. brongniartii conidia were being cycled from arboreal forest to subterranean sugarcane habitats and vice versa in the environment by H. sommeri life stages. This is the first record of this species of fungus infecting H. sommeri larvae and adults in South Africa. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{environmental impacts}} of tourism and recreation activities in the world heritage listed rainforests of northeast Australia and presents management strategies for sustainable visitor use of the protected area. Tropical rainforests are characterised by their low resistance and moderate to high resilience to impacts associated with human visitation. Visitor use in the World Heritage Area is mostly associated with walking tracks, camping areas, day use areas and off-road vehicle use of old forestry roads and tracks. Adverse environmental impacts range from vegetation trampling, soil compaction, water contamination and soil erosion at the local scale through to spread of weeds, feral animals and soil pathogens along extensive networks of old forestry roads and tracks at the regional scale. Concentration of visitor use is the most desirable management strategy for controlling adverse impacts at most World Heritage Area visitor nodes and sites, and includes methods such as <b>site</b> <b>hardening</b> and shielding to contain impacts. For dispersed visitor activities, such as off-road vehicle driving and long-distance walking, application of best practice methods by the tourist industry and recreational users such as removal of mud and soils from vehicle tyres and hiking boots before entering pathogen-free catchments, together with seasonal closure of roads and tracks, are the preferred management strategies. Retention of canopy cover at camping areas and day use areas, as well as along walking tracks and forestry roads is a simple, yet effective, management strategy for reduction {{of a range of}} adverse impacts, including dispersal of weeds and feral animals, edge effects, soil erosion and nutrient loss, road kill and linear barrier effects on rainforest fauna...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{three studies}} that make {{extensive use of}} geophysical non seismic methods, namely, magnetometry, gravimetry, conductivity, and ground penetrating radar. The first paper {{presents the results of}} a magnetometry study aimed to locate and delineate magnetic mineral bearing rocks associated with an intrusive at an undisclosed location. The study suggests that the pod-like magnetic mineral host rocks can be located and characterized by forward modeling, and the resulting calculated magnetic anomaly curve can be successfully cross-correlated with the observed data curve. As a result, cross-correlation can be used as an estimation of the fit between the curves and, therefore, as an objective quantitative quality control process. The second study regards the use of gravimetry to discern the rock fracturing pattern that contributes to the groundwater flow and control in the Mesilla Bolson, southern New Mexico and west Texas. By using densely spaced gravity measurements along north-south lines, and complimenting the dataset with the PACES gravity database, I present a series of northeast-southwest trending dip-slip fractures that create block displacements. I also propose a new location of the Mesilla Valley fault, a fault with no surface expression in the area. Finally, the third paper presents a systematic approach for locating archaeological remains using conductivity, magnetometry, and ground penetrating radar at the Three Rivers archaeological site, north of Tularosa, New Mexico. By using the aforementioned methods in that specific order and by increasing the sampling density while reducing the exploration area, I narrowed down a broad two acre exploration site to an 4 by 6 meter rectangle where the detailed GPR signal suggests that there are toppled walls, and probably <b>hardened</b> soil dwelling <b>sites</b> buried by seasonal flooding of the nearby Three Rivers creek. ...|$|R
40|$|This study defines and {{explores the}} nature of impact creep {{within the context of}} two {{contrasting}} case studies. The methods applied in undertaking this study consisted of a literature review and development and distribution of questionnaires to visitors at Monkey Mia and an interview of managers at Monkey Mia and Tree Top Walk. The project considered impact creep relevant to both public and private facility developments. Impact creep can be defined as a temporal sequence of changes that lead to a site being more developed. These changes confer both negative and positive impacts. Each impact creep situation may be deemed unique according to different tourism situations and attractions. Both Tree Top Walk and Monkey Mia have a history of increasing visitation which has increased the potential for further impacts. Management has responded accordingly and the resultant actions have reduced negative environmental impacts through <b>site</b> <b>hardening</b> and associated developments. The resultant development in turn appears to have contributed to an increased attractiveness for a wider visitor profile. At both Monkey Mia and the Tree Top Walk increasing visitor numbers were not an immediate concern. Generally visitors to both sites are predominantly first time visitors on a multi-destination trip. Visitors to these sites are most likely to visit in family groups or with friends of two to four persons, aged in the 25 to 49 year age bracket. In both surveys there were a higher proportion of females to males. At Monkey Mia, the majority of respondents are from overseas and Western Australia with the lowest proportion from interstate. In contrast, at Tree Top Walk, the proportion of overseas, Western Australia and interstate visitors was fairly even. Respondents were most likely to travel to the respective regions in passenger vehicles and generally stay for short visits (less than a week). The main attraction for respondents was the natural area attraction, i. e. dolphins at Monkey Mia and the Tingle forest/Tree Top Walk at the Valley of the Giants. The Monkey Mia visitor survey was also used to determine if management actions of <b>site</b> <b>hardening</b> detract from the visitor experience and to determine how visitors feel about highly developed sites such as those that contain permanent accommodation facilities and infrastructure. The survey revealed that visitors generally prefer natural landscapes with limited facilities. However, the facilities provided were not seen as being detractive and had no influence {{on the quality of the}} visit. Moreover, facilities may be considered as a positive influence because of the convenience they offer. A major difference between the two case studies is that impact creep has occurred according to different policy directives. Tree Top Walk was developed under a management plan that had clear guidelines. Monkey Mia had no management plan and joint management with the Shire of Shark Bay. When accommodation facilities were developed at Monkey Mia, the Western Australian Department of Conservation and Land Management (CALM) recommendations were ignored in favour for economic returns and political pressure. A notable difference between the two sites, therefore, is that Tree Top Walk has no accommodation facility so the visitation period is short, while Monkey Mia has accommodation which means that limiting visitor use is problematic because as many as 600 people stay in the vicinity of the interaction area overnight. For Tree Top Walk a dispersal strategy in the form of a visitor centre may help to focus attention away from the main attraction during busy periods and during wait times if restrictions are operating due to heavy demand. Because of the potential for increased visitation, crowding, conflicts and reduced visitor satisfaction at Monkey Mia limitations on use may have to be applied. Previous work has shown that use/access restrictions, in the form of a reservation or permit system, may be the best approach...|$|R
40|$|The {{shift in}} society from {{industrial}} towards {{a society where}} innovation, knowledge and creativity are the pillars of the economy has among others led to abandoned industrial sites. Government organisations are searching for ways to attract creative workers to their area. In the mean time conventional financial fundings of big redevelopments are no longer realistic, because of the building crisis. This thesis is aiming to develop a strategy for former industrial areas to redevelop, {{with the help of}} local (creative) entrepreneurs with limited big investments. We apply this strategy with a design on a former sugar factory in the city of Groningen. This former sugar factory is a 125 -hectare big <b>site,</b> with a <b>hardened</b> factory <b>site</b> and meadows in the periphery of the city. The municipality bought the area in 2010 and is now wondering what to do with this plot of opportunities within their borders. The council itself has no direct building need, or the resources to invest largely in the area; on the other hand it is aiming to become a ‘city of talent’. The research question is: How to create a spatial strategy for a creative-based urban development, with limited financial resources on a former industrial site, {{in the case of the}} sugar factory in the city of Groningen? Research shows that creative entrepreneurs can play an important role in transforming former industrial sites into attractive areas. Therefor it is important to know what spatial elements can attract these creative entrepreneurs to a certain area. It is important for them to agglomerate and meet in third places like bars and galleries in a certain area because that way they can a) get in contact with cultural gatekeepers b) derive a form of inspiration out of others, and the area c) use the creative reputation for their own cause. Research shows that creative entrepreneurs are drawn to an area that; a) has a certain sense of place b) is mixed in use, functions and style c) is flexible in their use d) provides contrasts of old (industrial) heritage and new attractive real estate e) is well accessible, close to the centre and provides a safe environment. A possible strategy to redevelop a former, not so popular enclosed site with creative entrepreneurs is by placemaking and building a infrastructural framework. By allowing creative entrepreneurs to use the space for all sorts of temporary projects the site a) gets known by potential future users B) improves the reputation of the site c) the value of the property increases and development can take place after a while. By providing in a basic infrastructural framework and leaving the infill flexible and changeable through time an area becomes attractive for all sorts of users. The strategy of the SuikerUnie uses this model of strategy, and applies two new elements. A) The use of the plots remains flexible and adaptable through time. B; the strategy proposes a gradual investment model, where the investments in the public space and network co-evolve along with the development of the inhabitants. In the case of the SuikerUnie the site is made accessible by adding a new clear basic infrastructural framework and a new station. The site is split up in three parts; a new creative district, an agricultural park, and a rural area. The creative district is located on the hardened area of the site. The former factory is redeveloped in a creative factory; the station is placed next to it and provides a new link to the other side of the train track. It connects to the current infrastructure and to two redeveloped hangars. One hangar is redeveloped into a biological food market the other into an educational institute. The rest of the creative area is coming to life by adding student container within the new infrastructural grid, and providing physical space for temporary projects. When investors (small or big) are interested, the containers can move a block and the temporary projects get a little bit less space. This way the area transforms towards a creative new district in town. The agricultural park provides a spatial connection between the rural landscape and the city park outside of the area. The park shows in an aesthetic way all sorts of agricultural crops. The products are sold in the biological market and attract potential new inhabitants to the site. The rural area is transformed from meadows into an area where one can work, recreate and live in a green environment. This is done by making a new infrastructural framework along the existing ditch pattern. The plots within the framework are rented out to allotment owners. They pay the ground price back in yearly small installments. These new users are encouraged to build their own house through time. Along with the amount they built on their plot, the yearly installment increases. The quality of the street-profile gets upgraded alongside with the transformation of the area. The more the new inhabitants invest in their homes, the more the municipality has to invest in the public space. Rules and guidelines for building your house prevents the area from being enclosed and scattered. The outcome of this strategy is not predicteble beforehand. The area becomes a new centre for living, working and recreating. But it is possible that the area remains a low profile green area where there are a lot of allotment gardens, student houses and a biological creative centre. The framework and the financial model is flexible and adaptable enough to capture these outcomes. The innovative part of the strategy is the combination of using all sorts of actors with a spatial need (not only creative entrepreneurs) and allowing the public space and the amount of investments by the owners to upgrade alongside with the development of the inhabitants. The gradual growth of the area, the flexible outcome of the area, in combination with the chance to start today makes this strategy truly creative. Urban RegenerationUrbanismArchitectur...|$|R
40|$|In the KwaZulu-Natal (KZN) Midlands North {{region of}} South Africa, the {{importance}} and increased prevalence of endemic scarabaeids, particularly Hypopholis sommeri Burmeister and Schizonycha affinis Boheman (Coleoptera: Melolonthinae), as soil pests of sugarcane, and a need for their control was established. The development of a mycoinsecticide offers an environmentally friendly alternative to chemical insecticides. The identification of a diversity of white grub species, in two Scarabaeidae subfamilies, representing seven genera were collected in sugarcane as a pest complex. Hypopholis sommeri and S. affinis were the most prevalent species. The increased seasonal abundances, diversity and highly aggregated nature of these scarabaeid species in summer months, suggested that targeting and control strategies for these pests {{should be considered in}} this season. Increased rainfall, relative humidity and soil temperatures were linked to the increased occurrence of scarab adults and neonate grubs. Beauveria brongniartii (Saccardo) Petch epizootics were recorded at two sites in the KZN Midlands North on H. sommeri. Seventeen different fluorescently-labelled microsatellite PCR primers were used to target 78 isolates of Beauveria sp. DNA. Microsatellite data resolved two distinct clusters of Beauveria isolates which represented the Beauveria bassiana senso stricto (Balsamo) Vuillemin and B. brongniartii species groups. These groupings were supported by two gene regions, the nuclear ribosomal Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) and the nuclear B locus (Bloc) gene of which 23 exemplar Beauveria isolates were represented and sequenced. When microsatellite data were analysed, 26 haplotypes among 58 isolates of B. brongniartii were distinguished. Relatively low levels of genetic diversity were detected in B. brongniartii and isolates were shown to be closely related. There was no genetic differentiation between the two <b>sites,</b> <b>Harden</b> Heights and Canema in the KZN Midlands North. High gene flow from swarming H. sommeri beetles is the proposed mechanism for this lack of genetic differentiation between populations. Microsatellite analyses also showed that B. brongniartii conidia were being cycled from arboreal to subterranean habitats in the environment by H. sommeri beetles. This was the first record of this species of fungus causing epizootics on the larvae and adults of H. sommeri in South Africa. The virulence of 21 isolates of Beauveria brongniartii and two isolates of B. bassiana were evaluated against the adults and larvae of S. affinis and the adults of H. sommeri and Tenebrio molitor Linnaeus (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Despite being closely-related, B. brongniartii isolates varied significantly in their virulence towards different hosts and highlighted the host specific nature of B. brongniartii towards S. affinis when compared to B. bassiana. Adults of S. affinis were significantly more susceptible to B. brongniartii isolates than the second (L 2) or third instar (L 3) grubs. The median lethal time (LT₅₀) of the most virulent B. brongniartii isolate (C 13) against S. affinis adults was 7. 8 days and probit analysis estimated a median lethal concentration (LC₅₀) of 4. 4 × 10 ⁷ conidia/ml⁻¹. When L 2 grubs were treated with a concentration of 1. 0 × 10 ⁸ conidia/ml⁻¹, B. brongniartii isolates HHWG 1, HHB 39 A and C 17 caused mortality in L 2 grubs within 18. 4 - 19. 8 days (LT₅₀). Beauveria brongniartii isolate HHWG 1 was tested against the L 3 grubs of S. affinis at four different concentrations. At the lowest concentration (1 × 10 ⁶ conidia/ml⁻¹), the LT₅₀ was 25. 8 days, and at the highest concentration (1 × 10 ⁹ conidia/ml⁻¹) the LT₅₀ dropped to 15. 1 days. The persistence of B. bassiana isolate 4222 formulated on rice and wheat bran and buried at eight field sites in the KZN Midlands North was evaluated by plating out a suspension of treated soil onto a selective medium. All eight field sites showed a significant decline in B. bassiana CFUs per gram of soil over time, with few conidia still present in the samples after a year. Greater declines in CFUs were observed at some sites but {{there were no significant differences}} observed in the persistence of conidia formulated on rice or wheat bran as carriers. Overall, poor persistence of B. bassiana isolate 4222 was attributed to suboptimum temperatures, rainfall, which rapidly degraded the nutritive carriers, attenuated fungal genotype and the action of antagonistic soil microbes. Growers’ perceptions of white grubs as pests and the feasibility of a mycoinsecticide market were evaluated by means of a semi-structured questionnaire. The study showed that the reduced feasibility of application, general lack of potential demand for a product, high cost factors and most importantly, the lack of pest perception, were factors which would negatively affect the adoption of a granular mycoinsecticide. Growers however exhibited a positive attitude towards mycoinsecticides, and showed all the relevant attributes for successful technology adoption. It is recommended that because B. brongniartii epizootics were recorded on target pests which indicated good host specificity, dispersal ability and persistence of the fungus in the intended environment of application; that a mycoinsecticide based on this fungal species be developed. What will likely increase adoption and success of a mycoinsecticide is collaboration between various industries partners to increases market potential in other crops such as Acacia mearnsii De Wild (Fabales: Fabaceae) ...|$|R
