40|$|Quality of Service in Optical Burst Switched Networks using Early <b>Dropping</b> <b>Mechanism</b> with Different Network Characteristics Keywords: Optical Burst Switching (OBS), Absolute Quality of Service (QoS), Early <b>Dropping</b> <b>Mechanism,</b> Dense Wave Length Division Multiplexing (DWDM). Optical Burst Switching is a {{promising}} bufferless DWDM switching technology that can potentially provide high wavelength utilization. Quality of Service support {{has become an}} important issue in OBS networks. There are two models to guarantee QoS in OBS networks. Those are relative QoS guarantee and absolute QoS guarantee. Most existing schemes are based on relative QoS model and in those models the service levels can be defined relative to the service requirements of another class of traffic. In absolute QoS model it provides a bound for loss probability of the guaranteed traffic. This kind of hard guarantee is essential to support applications with bandwidth constraints. Further efficient admission control and recourse provisioning mechanisms will enhance the service of absolute QoS model to guarantee the service requirements in the OBS networks. Early <b>dropping</b> <b>mechanism</b> is proposed to maintain the dropping probability in Absolute QoS model in OBS networks. Due to the bufferless nature of the OBS core nodes, the early <b>dropping</b> <b>mechanism</b> computes the intentional dropping probability based on measured, online loss probability. In early <b>dropping</b> <b>mechanism</b> it can be simply implemented by using a threshold value which is responsible to maintain the maximum acceptable loss probability. But in this mechanism the lower priority class of traffic suffers from high loss probability when higher priority Glasses exceed its threshold vales of loss probability. Early dropping by Span mechanism introduces a span of acceptable loss probabilities rather than using one threshold value andthis mechanism has improved QoS guarantee in higher priority classes of traffic while reducing the loss probability of lower priority classes as well. Further the performance of this mechanism can be applied in a dynamic wave length assigning network in order to guarantee the absolute QoS with efficient recourse provisionin...|$|E

In particular, this model is controllable, able to provide the "tuning knobs" for network operators to quantitatively differentiate the quality-of-service (QoS) of different classes, and lends itself naturally to simple pricing schemes. In this paper, we focus on the issue of how to practically implement such a QoS differentiation scheme at high-speed routers using efficient buffer management and packet scheduling mechanisms. We first propose a uniform scheduler. Unlike previously proposed schedulers which can be used only for a single QoS metric, our scheduler is suitable for various QoS metrics.

40|$|AbstractâMultimedia {{applications}} {{require the}} transmission of real-time streams over a network. These streams often exhibit variable bandwidth requirements, and require high bandwidths and guarantees from the network. This creates problems when such streams are delivered over the Internet. To solve these problems, recently, a small set of differentiated services has been introduced. Among these, Premium Service is suitable for transmitting real-time stored stream (full knowledge of the stream characteristics). It uses a bandwidth allocation mechanism (BAM) based on the stream peak rate. Due to the variable bandwidth requirement, the peak rate BAM can waste large amount of bandwidth. In this {{paper we propose a}} new BAM that uses less bandwidth than the peak rate BAM, while providing the same service. Our BAM does not affect the real-time stream quality of service (QoS) and does not require any modification to the Premium Service Architecture. We also introduce several frame <b>dropping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> that further reduce bandwidth consump-tion subject to a QoS constraint when coupled with the above BAM. The proposed BAM and the <b>dropping</b> <b>mechanisms</b> are evaluated using Motion JPEG and MPEG videos and are shown to be effective in reducing bandwidth requirements. Further, since VCR operations are very useful in video streaming, we propose a mechanism that introduces these operations in our BAM. Through simulations we show the effectiveness of this mechanism.

Accurate buffer dimensioning has attracted lot of research interest as large on-chip buffers result in increased silicon area and higher costs. Multimedia applications present the flexibility of trading off quality for buffer space without any noticeable deterioration in video quality. The frame dropping scheme is crucial here to drop frames appropriately such that the required buffer size is reduced and target quality requirement is satisfied. Towards this, we propose a simple pri-oritized frame <b>dropping</b> <b>mechanism</b> which reduces the required buffer space more than existing frame dropping policies. We also provide a fast iterative procedure to find the minimum buffer size for a video clip with O(log(Ndrop)) number of iterations, where Ndrop is the maximum number of frames that can be dropped for a video clip so that a prespecified quality in terms of peak signal to noise ratio (PSNR) value is satisfied...|$|E

Most current decoding systems require there to always be sufficient resources available.

A distinguishing characteristic of our framework is the ability to decode a video in priority order and drop low priority work if there are not enough resources to fully decode the video. In our particular case we adapt by dropping frames. Additionally, we make no use of a feedback loop as part of the data <b>dropping</b> <b>mechanism.</b> This is important because the variability of video content makes it difficult to predict the relationship between CPU requirements and video content.

The scheme rewards multiple priority levels in encoded video and fact that most of the transmission losses actually occur at the source control.

40|$|Video {{streaming}} {{applications are}} more and more present in our life, but despite the advances of network technologies, several users experience QoS problems. This is mainly due to the high bandwidth requirements of these applications that contrasts with the network bandwidth limitation. To mitigate these QoS problems, video frame dropping mechanisms are often used for adapting the video stream to the network conditions. The selection of the video frames to drop is done considering the perceived quality of the video play out; audio perception is not considered in the selection process. In this paper we show that by taking into account only the video play out quality, audio problems arise very frequently. Hence, we propose a video frame <b>dropping</b> <b>mechanism</b> that takes into consideration the perceived quality of both audio and video play out.
