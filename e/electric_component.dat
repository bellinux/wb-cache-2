50|$|Both {{actuator}} {{signals and}} operation commands of the DCS are processed within the actuator controls. This task can in principle be assumed by external controls, e.g. a PLC.

Controls use the switchgear to switch the electric motor on or off depending on the signals or commands present. Another task of the actuator controls is to provide the DCS with feedback signals, e.g. when reaching a valve end position.|$|E
50|$|Dielectric heating {{involves}} the heating of electrically insulating materials by dielectric loss. A changing electric field across the material causes energy to be dissipated as the molecules attempt {{to line up}} with the continuously changing electric field. This changing electric field {{may be caused by}} an electromagnetic wave propagating in free space (as in a microwave oven), or it may be caused by a rapidly alternating electric field inside a capacitor. In the latter case, there is no freely-propagating electromagnetic wave, and the changing electric field may be seen as analogous to the <b>electric</b> <b>component</b> of an antenna near field. In this case, although the heating is accomplished by changing the electric field inside the capacitive cavity at radio-frequency (RF) frequencies, no actual radio waves are either generated or absorbed. In this sense, the effect is the direct electrical analog of magnetic induction heating, which is also near-field effect (thus not involving radio waves).|$|E

50|$|In the {{theoretical}} investigation of electric circuits, {{the velocity of}} propagation of the electromagnetic field through space is usually not considered; the field is assumed, as a precondition, to be present throughout space. The magnetic component of the field {{is considered to be}} in phase with the current, and the <b>electric</b> <b>component</b> is considered to be in phase with the voltage. The electric field starts at the conductor, and propagates through space at the velocity of light (which depends on the material it is traveling through). Note that the electromagnetic fields do not move through space. It is the electromagnetic energy that moves, the corresponding fields simple grow and decline in a region of space in response to the flow of energy. At any point in space, the electric field corresponds not to the condition of the electric energy flow at that moment, but to that of the flow at a moment earlier. The latency is determined by the time required for the field to propagate from the conductor to the point under consideration. In other words, the greater the distance from the conductor, the more the electric field lags.|$|E

Furthermore, while the temporal coherence of the source must remain low as in classical OCT (i.e. a broad spectrum), the spatial coherence must also be low to avoid parasitical interferences (i.e. a source with a large size).|$|E

Moreover, the HEV/EV offer {{the opportunity to}} have various actuation architectures but raise the probl em of over actuated systems. Therefore, it is of fi rst interest to ask if energy gains can be obtained by managing the vehicle dynamic behavior in this urban situation. In previous works, studies about optimal architectures have been proposed and the objective {{of this paper is to}} investigate the effects of <b>electric</b> <b>component</b> dynam ics on the battery and vehicle energy efficiencies. Methodology: A simulation method is used in order to keep consta nt as much as possible of the parameters governing the vehicle energy efficiency. A control allocation is chosen to generate control signals to actuators for two selected vehicle architectures during a representative manoe uver. This control strategy allows to determine act uator inputs for architectures without changing control s tructure. These inputs are applied on actuators in a virtual test bench whose parameters have been validated from an actual delivery vehicle. This simulation model is supplemented or not by dynamic models of electrical components for all architectures. The electric com ponent parameters are only considered to analyze the batte ry and vehicle consumed powers/energies in regenera tive vehicle dynamic proposed in previous author works. Energy losses in tire/road contact or actuation ene rgy in steering system are included in the energy comparis on for the investigated architectures. Results: The performance of the proposed control allocation is evaluated by comparison simulated trajectories o f two selected vehicle architectures and reference trajec tory with or without <b>electric</b> <b>component</b> models. The proposed regenerative vehicle dynamics is studied by analyzi ng the wheel torques and steering wheel angles. The simulation results of battery and vehicle consumed powers/energies are estimated and allow to determin e the optimal vehicle architecture in terms of energy and the best <b>electric</b> <b>component</b> parameters. Limitations of this study: These results need to be verified with other refere nce trajectories and a method to improve the choice of weighting matrices should be investigated. What does the paper offer that is new in the field in comparison to other works of the author: The influence of <b>electric</b> <b>component</b> dynamics on the energy management for various vehicle architecture s has been studied. The analysis of power/energy differen ces due to the integration of <b>electric</b> <b>component</b> mo dels offer the perspectives which focus on the optimization of <b>electric</b> <b>component</b> dynamic parameters. Conclusion: Some simulation results are presented and discussed. We can see that the proposed control allocation i s robust with or without the integration of electric compone nt models into vehicle dynamics. The optimal vehicl e architecture in term of consumed energy is justifie d by analyzing the battery and vehicle consumed power/energy. It also proves the effectiveness of t he proposed method which is used to minimize energy consumption of hybrid vehicle. Moreover, the best v alues of <b>electric</b> <b>component</b> parameters in terms of consumed power/energy will be determined. The appli cation of this method to another applicative object (passenger car, bus multi-axles vehicle [...] .) is not a theoretical problem if the object dynamics can be m odelled...|$|E
40|$|The chiral {{component}} of the Casimir-Polder potential is derived {{within the framework of}} macroscopic quantum electrodynamics.
