40|$|Mice {{treated with}} <b>hyperchlorinated</b> <b>water</b> (50 ppm of chlorine) and control mice, {{drinking}} tap water (1 - 3 ppm of chlorine) were inoculated with 2. 5 x 10 [raised {{to the power}} of 6] sarcoma 180 cells, by intraperitoneal route. Tumor evolution was measured by enumeration of tumor cells in peritoneal cavity and by evaluation of weight gain at different time intervals after tumor implantation. In mice treated with excessive amounts of chlorine there was enhancement of tumor growth demonstrated by: (a) shorter incubation period and increased weight gain (ascites formation) after tumor implantation; (b) increased number of tumor cells in the peritoneal cavity 2, 3 and 4 days after tumor challenge. The number of peritoneal cells exsudated after tumor implantation was lower in mice treated with <b>hyperchlorinated</b> <b>water</b> than in controls. The tumor enhancement observed after excessive chlorine ingestion would be due to: (a) reduction of the number of peritoneal macrophages that migrate to the peritoneal cavity and (b) reduction of the tumoricidal capacity of peritonela macrophages induced by the direct effect of chlorine or by the reduction of the amount of endogenous endotoxins due to the bactericidal effect of chlorine...|$|E
