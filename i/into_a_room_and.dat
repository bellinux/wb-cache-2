5|$|Veronica {{learns that}} there may be a {{connection}} to a fraternity, and Wallace (Percy Daggs III) informs her that it is the secret society for which he is being recruited, the Castle. Wallace tells her that the equipment used to tape him was similar to that which was used to film Veronica and Piz. He starts to go through initiation with the group in order to ascertain the members' identities for Veronica. The members make him go <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> ask him very personal questions, electrically shocking him if he answers untruthfully. When they find out that Veronica has sent Wallace, they forcibly remove him, but he is able to figure out the identity of one of the other recruits. Veronica sneaks into the house of the recruit Wallace names and sees a large portrait of Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried). She hears voices and hides behind a curtain before two men emerge. They speak about the Castle, and Veronica discovers that one of them is Jake Kane. After they leave, Veronica steals his computers. Keith investigates the robbery the following day, spotting Veronica on surveillance cameras; however, he does not initially report his daughter. Veronica asks Mac (Tina Majorino) whether any computer could crack Jake's password, and she is taken to a supercomputer on campus.|$|E
25|$|Continuing his new {{interest}} in the figure, Gleizes strove to manipulate a genre subject with the same sobriety and broad scale that had always informed his landscapes.

25|$|He {{did so in}} a field next to the old {{road that}} led to Pitești. Maluțan then told his four {{passengers}} {{that he could do}} nothing more. The Securitate men ran to the roadside and began to flag down passing cars. Two cars stopped, one of them driven by a forestry official and one a red Dacia driven by a local doctor. However, the doctor was not happy about getting involved and, after a short time driving the Ceaușescus, faked engine trouble. A car of a bicycle repair man was then flagged down and he took them to Târgoviște. The driver of the car, Nicolae Petrișor, convinced them that they could hide successfully in an agricultural technical institute on the edge of town. When they arrived, the director guided the Ceaușescus <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> then locked them in. They were arrested by local police at about 15:30, then after some wandering around transported to the Târgoviște garrison's military compound and held captive for several days until their trial.|$|E

25|$|The wounded Emery {{suggests}} that Annie {{be killed in}} order to allow everyone to escape, alarming the rest of the group. While in the kitchen, Cathy Kramer is attacked by Mrs. Waterman and is rescued by Nick. The two decide to tie up the deranged woman and leave her in the kitchen. They agree not to inform Emery so that the unstable young man does not become more unbalanced. A ghostly Sukeena appears and drags Mrs. Waterman off into the dark wine cellar. As Nick and Cathy head back toward the main hall, the house changes around them and they become lost. A mysterious shape under the carpet chases them, and they flee. The shape begins to catch up to them, and Nick shoves Cathy <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> slams the door behind her, turning around {{just in time to see}} a skeletal monster rushing up to him. With silence in the hallway, Cathy opens the door again but finds no sign of Nick or the entity in the empty hallway. As the house continues to change around her, Cathy ends up in the attic. Suddenly overcome by the urge to automatically write, she witnesses the murder of John Rimbauer by Ellen and Sukeena. Steve and Rachel, meanwhile, decide to look for Nick and Cathy. They find Cathy in the attic, where she is about to be attacked by a corpse-like creature. Their presence seemingly prevents the house from acting, and the corpse drops lifeless to the floor. The corpse's withered arm lets them deduce that the carcass is that of Steven's missing great-aunt (and Ellen's daughter), April Rimbauer. Suddenly, April's corpse releases a bright white light from its mouth and instantly disintegrates.|$|E
500|$|Despite Cain's disability, author Andersen Gabrych {{describes}} the character's unique form of language {{as the key}} factor in what makes Cain an excellent detective; the ability to walk <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> [...] "know" [...] something is wrong based on body language. During the first arc of the Batgirl comic book series entitled [...] "Silent Running", Cassandra Cain encounters a psychic who [...] "reprograms" [...] her brain, enabling her to comprehend verbal language, while simultaneously losing the ability to predict movements. This issue is resolved during the second arc of the series, [...] "A Knight Alone", when Batgirl encounters the assassin Lady Shiva who agrees to teach her how to predict movement once again. Six years after its debut, DC Comics canceled the Batgirl comic book series with issue #73 (2006), ending with Cain relinquishing her role as Batgirl.|$|E
500|$|In May 2005, English actor Daniel Craig stated MGM and {{producers}} Michael G. Wilson and Barbara Broccoli had assured {{him he would}} get the role of Bond, and Matthew Vaughn told reporters MGM offered {{him the opportunity to}} direct the new film, but Eon Productions at that point had not approached either of them. A year beforehand, Craig rejected the idea of starring, as he felt the series had descended into formula; only when he read the script did he become interested. Craig read all of Fleming's novels to prepare for the part, and cited Mossad and British Secret Service agents who served as advisors on the set of Munich as inspiring because, [...] "Bond has just come out of the service and he's a killer. [...] You can see it in their eyes, you know immediately: oh, hello, he's a killer. There's a look. These guys walk <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> very subtly they check the perimeters for an exit. That's the sort of thing I wanted." ...|$|E

500|$|Mercury booked the New York Dolls at The Record Plant in New York City, {{where they}} {{recorded}} their self-titled debut album in April 1973. Rundgren was originally {{concerned that they}} had taken [...] "the worst sounding studio in the city at that time" [...] {{because it was the}} only one available to them with the short time given to record and release the album. He later said that expectations for the band and the festive atmosphere of the recording sessions proved to be more of a problem: [...] "The Dolls were critics' darlings and the press had kind of adopted them. Plus, there were lots of extra people around, socializing, which made it hard to concentrate." [...] New York Dolls was recorded in eight days on a budget of only $17,000. With a short amount of studio time and no concept in mind for the album, the band chose which songs to record based on how well they had been received at their live shows. In Johansen's own words, [...] "we went <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> just recorded. It wasn't like these people who conceptualize things. It was just a document of what was going on at the time." ...|$|E
2500|$|The brazen {{quality of}} Turner's screen roles was {{reflected}} in her public life. With her deep voice, Turner was often compared to a young Lauren Bacall. When the two met, Turner reportedly introduced herself by saying, [...] "Hi, I'm the young you." [...] In the 1980s, she boasted that [...] "on a night when I feel really good about myself, I can walk <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> if a man doesn't look at me, he's probably gay." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Wong and his students, {{he became}} active in beimo (比武): semi-organised bare-knuckle {{challenge}} fights in Hong Kong (sometimes known as 'kung fu elimination contests'). Supposedly {{there were no}} rules, protective equipment, or time limits. As Wong recalled in an interview, [...] "When I competed, it was in secret. We went <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> the door was shut {{and there were no}} rules. The government did not allow them. They were illegal, but we didn't care. We fought until the other guy was knocked out." [...] Beimo competitions were believed to be held anywhere that was found to be convenient. Some beimo competitions were held on the streets in Hong Kong.|$|E

2500|$|Wong's {{participation}} in, {{and views}} on, tournaments reflected his philosophy on martial arts. When asked, [...] "Did you compete in any organised tournaments with rules?" [...] Wong replied, [...] "Not in boxing. When I competed, {{it was in}} secret. We went <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room,</b> <b>and</b> the door was shut {{and there were no}} rules. The government did not allow them. They were illegal, but we didn't care. We fought until the other guy was knocked out." [...] When asked, [...] "Did you ever consider competing in combat sports?" [...] Wong replied, [...] "I have always liked boxing, I like anything about fighting, but my kind of fighting is not the sport version, it is real fighting where there are no rules." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gavin was {{confirmed}} to be Sharon's birth {{father in the}} episode broadcast on 30 October 2015, in which he repeated Sharon's adopted father Den Watts's (Leslie Grantham) iconic line [...] "Hello, princess". Digital Spy Daniel Kilkelly said EastEnders had [...] "delivered the daddy of all cliffhangers". Taylforth confirmed that her character Kathy is unaware {{of the connection between}} Sharon and Gavin, and said, [...] always said that she would walk <b>into</b> <b>a</b> <b>room</b> <b>and</b> know straight away , and especially when he said those words: 'Hello princess'. We had the full scripts for the episode, but the other cast members didn't know what was going on. Paul was just fantastic delivering that line." [...] Nicholas said that the [...] "hello, princess" [...] line was used because it was a definite way of linking Gavin and Den. Inside Soap said that Sharon discovering Gavin is her father [...] "has to be the biggest [...] of all" [...] for Sharon, but added that viewers had already guessed before the episode was broadcast. Soaplife thought it was the [...] "most shocking reveal" [...] of 2015 in all British soap operas, saying they were [...] "stunned". They also opined that Gavin seemingly genuinely wants to reconnect with Sharon and be a father to her and seems very fond of Dennis, and that if Sharon were to reject him, he would probably try to kidnap Dennis.|$|E
