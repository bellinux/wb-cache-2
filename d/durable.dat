5|$|All {{of these}} methods date the wood, not the {{inscriptions}} themselves. Pacific rosewood is not <b>durable,</b> and is unlikely to survive long in Easter Island's climate.|$|E
5|$|Development of self-glowing actinide-doped {{materials}} with <b>durable</b> crystalline matrices {{is a new}} area of actinide utilization as the addition of alpha-emitting radionuclides to some glasses and crystals may confer luminescence.|$|E
5|$|Red-pink in colour, {{the timber}} resembles English oak. It {{has been used}} in boatbuilding and is strong, <b>durable</b> and distinctively patterned.|$|E
5|$|Researchers have {{discovered}} archaeological evidence of musical instruments {{in many parts}} of the world. Some finds are 67,000 years old, however their status as musical instruments is often in dispute. Consensus solidifies about artifacts dated back to around 37,000 years old and later. Only artifacts made from <b>durable</b> materials or using <b>durable</b> methods tend to survive. As such, the specimens found cannot be irrefutably placed as the earliest musical instruments.|$|E
5|$|Rubber {{injection}} moulding process produces a high yield of <b>durable</b> products, {{making it the}} most efficient and cost-effective method of moulding. Consistent vulcanisation processes involving precise temperature control significantly reduces all waste material.|$|E
5|$|Titanium alloys {{are used}} in {{spectacle}} frames that are rather expensive but highly <b>durable,</b> long lasting, light weight, and cause no skin allergies. Many backpackers use titanium equipment, including cookware, eating utensils, lanterns, and tent stakes. Though slightly more expensive than traditional steel or aluminium alternatives, titanium products can be significantly lighter without compromising strength. Titanium horseshoes are preferred to steel by farriers because it is lighter and more <b>durable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Using {{actinides}} {{in nuclear}} fuel, sealed radioactive sources or advanced {{materials such as}} self-glowing crystals has many potential benefits. However, a serious concern is the extremely high radiotoxicity of actinides and their migration in the environment. Use of chemically unstable forms of actinides in MOX and sealed radioactive sources is not appropriate by modern safety standards. There {{is a challenge to}} develop stable and <b>durable</b> actinide-bearing materials, which provide safe storage, use and final disposal. A key need is application of actinide solid solutions in <b>durable</b> crystalline host phases.|$|E
5|$|Armies {{of workers}} would gather a long, <b>durable</b> grass known as shicra in the {{highlands}} above the city, tie the grass strands into loosely meshed bags, fill the bags with boulders, and then pack the trenches behind each successive retaining wall of the step pyramids with the stone-filled bags.|$|E
5|$|Cut sod bricks, called terrone in Spanish, {{can be used}} to make {{tough and}} <b>durable</b> walls. The sod is cut from soil that has a heavy mat of grass roots, which may be found in river bottom lands. It is stood on edge to dry before being used in construction.|$|E
5|$|Fired bricks {{were being}} used to build <b>durable</b> masonry across Europe, Asia and North Africa by 1200 BC and still remain an {{important}} building material. Modern fired clay bricks are formed from clays or shales, shaped and then fired in a kiln for 8–12 hours at a temperature of 900–1150°C.|$|E
5|$|He is {{credited}} with popularising a technical innovation in the printing of illustrations using wood. He adopted metal-engraving tools to cut hard boxwood across the grain, producing printing blocks that could be integrated with metal type, but were much more <b>durable</b> than traditional woodcuts. The result was high-quality illustration at a low price.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 Coca-Cola began a {{collaboration}} with Emeco {{to create a}} 1006-based chair made out of recycled Coca-Cola bottles, which was released in 2010. Metropolis Magazine {{said it was a}} public relations effort by Coke to make a <b>durable</b> product out of their bottles; they also hoped to encourage other manufacturers to do the same.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton {{described}} comets as {{compact and}} <b>durable</b> solid bodies moving in oblique orbit and their tails as thin streams of vapor emitted by their nuclei, ignited or heated by the Sun. Newton suspected that comets were {{the origin of}} the life-supporting component of air.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{helped develop}} the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution, a {{statistical}} means of describing aspects of the kinetic theory of gases. He is also known for presenting the first <b>durable</b> colour photograph in 1861 and for his foundational work on analysing the rigidity of rod-and-joint frameworks (trusses) like those in many bridges.|$|E
5|$|Metal corsets {{for medical}} {{purposes}} {{continued to be}} used in the 18th and early 19th century, although equivalent garments made from canvas were increasingly used in their place. In 1894, A.M. Phelps of the American Orthopaedic Association recommended an aluminium corset coated with waterproof enamel for sufferers of Pott disease or curvature of the spine. Made from a cast of the patient's body, the advantages of such a garment were that aluminium was lightweight, <b>durable,</b> thin enough to be worn beneath clothing, and could be worn while bathing. Such corsets were still being recommended in the early 20th century as cheaper and more <b>durable</b> in the longer run than plaster moulds, although their initial expense was greater.|$|E
5|$|One of Innis's primary {{contributions}} to communications studies was {{to apply the}} dimensions {{of time and space}} to various media. He divided media into time-binding and space-binding types. Time-binding media are <b>durable.</b> They include clay or stone tablets. Space-binding media are more ephemeral. They include modern media such as radio, television, and mass circulation newspapers.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide {{is used as}} {{a support}} and {{shelving}} material in high temperature kilns such as for firing ceramics, glass fusing, or glass casting. SiC kiln shelves are considerably lighter and more <b>durable</b> than traditional alumina shelves.|$|E
5|$|The Pro-Line {{series was}} <b>durable</b> and fault-tolerant, with many models lasting for years. However, because they used {{solid-state}} amplifiers, {{they are not}} as highly regarded as the older tube-based Leslies, because they lack the characteristic sound when the amp is overdriven.|$|E
5|$|The Romans made <b>durable</b> {{concrete}} {{strong enough}} for load-bearing walls. Roman concrete contains a rubble of broken bricks and rocks set in mortar. The mortar included lime and pozzolana, a volcanic material that {{contributed significantly to}} its strength. Roman concrete structures such as the Colosseum, completed in 80 AD, still stand.|$|E
5|$|The micro {{format is}} the most <b>durable</b> {{from the point of}} view of {{designed}} insertion lifetime. The standard and mini connectors have a design lifetime of 1,500 insertion-removal cycles, the improved Mini-B connectors increased this to 5,000. The micro connectors were designed with frequent charging of portable devices in mind, so have a design life of 10,000 cycles and also place the flexible contacts, which wear out sooner, on the easily replaced cable, while the more <b>durable</b> rigid contacts are located in the receptacles. Likewise, the springy component of the retention mechanism, parts that provide required gripping force, were also moved into plugs on the cable side.|$|E
5|$|The soil is {{moistened}} {{so it will}} compact into {{a stable}} structure when packed into woven polypropylene or burlap sacks or tubes. Plastic mesh is sometimes used. Polypropylene (pp) sacks are most common, since they are <b>durable</b> when covered, cheap, and widely available.|$|E
5|$|The timber {{is fairly}} hard and resembles silky oak (Grevillea robusta). It is <b>durable</b> {{and can be}} readily {{polished}} and worked with, making it amenable for use in furniture, picture frames and tool handles.|$|E
5|$|Because of its durability, {{titanium}} {{has become}} more popular for designer jewelry (particularly, titanium rings). Its inertness makes it {{a good choice for}} those with allergies or those who will be wearing the jewelry in environments such as swimming pools. Titanium is also alloyed with gold to produce an alloy that can be marketed as 24-carat gold because the 1% of alloyed Ti is insufficient to require a lesser mark. The resulting alloy is roughly the hardness of 14-carat gold and is more <b>durable</b> than pure 24-carat gold.|$|E
5|$|Copper {{has been}} used since ancient times as a <b>durable,</b> {{corrosion}} resistant, and weatherproof architectural material. Roofs, flashings, rain gutters, downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, and doors have been made from copper for {{hundreds or thousands of}} years. Copper's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding, building expansion joints, radio frequency shielding, and antimicrobial and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and counter tops. Some of copper's other important benefits as an architectural material include low thermal movement, light weight, lightning protection, and recyclability.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 2011, North Michigan Avenue was {{completely}} repaved from the Chicago River to Oak Street with a <b>durable</b> stone-matrix asphalt pavement mix that incorporated {{high levels of}} recycled materials, including waste shingles, ground tire rubber, and asphalt millings, diverting some 800 tons of material from landfills. The $1 million project was completed without ever completely halting traffic on the street. In July 2012, the City of Chicago and CDOT were honored with the Environmental Leadership Award from the National Asphalt Pavement Association.|$|E
5|$|Internal {{layers of}} mudstone, {{conglomerate}} and siltstone interrupt the limestone horizontally. These layers are {{more resistant to}} attack by carbonic acid and they can therefore act as protective capstones of fins, windows and hoodoos. Many of the more <b>durable</b> hoodoos are capped with a type of magnesium-rich limestone called dolomite. Dolomite dissolves at a much slower rate, and consequently protects the weaker limestone underneath.|$|E
5|$|Irving's {{writings}} on Columbus are {{a mixture of}} history and fiction, a genre now called romantic history. Irving based them on extensive research in the Spanish archives, but also added imaginative elements aimed at sharpening the story. The first of these works {{is the source of}} the <b>durable</b> myth that medieval Europeans believed the Earth was flat. (See Myth of the flat earth.) According to the popular book, Columbus proved the Earth was round.|$|E
5|$|Many beetles have {{beautiful}} and <b>durable</b> elytra {{that have been}} used as material in arts, with beetlewing the best example. Sometimes, they are incorporated into ritual objects for their religious significance. Whole beetles, either as-is or encased in clear plastic, are made into objects ranging from cheap souvenirs such as key chains to expensive fine-art jewellery. In parts of Mexico, beetles of the genus Zopherus are made into living brooches by attaching costume jewelry and golden chains, which is made possible by the incredibly hard elytra and sedentary habits of the genus.|$|E
5|$|Monster CEO Noel Lee {{claims the}} average {{consumer}} {{may not be able}} to tell the difference on-screen, but that Monster's video cables have higher bandwidth, are future-proofed, are more <b>durable</b> and that they perform better over long distances. Many reviewers stress in turn that Monster cables are not needed for lower-resolution televisions or over short distances and that the difference in audio quality is not substantial enough.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{economic}} foundations of Byzantium was trade, fostered by the maritime character of the Empire. Textiles must have been {{by far the most}} important item of export; silks were certainly imported into Egypt, and appeared also in Bulgaria, and the West. The state strictly controlled both the internal and the international trade, and retained the monopoly of issuing coinage, maintaining a <b>durable</b> and flexible monetary system adaptable to trade needs.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{a larger}} {{beautification}} plan for the Midway Plaisance, Time was constructed from {{a new type of}} molded, steel-reinforced concrete that was claimed to be more <b>durable</b> and cheaper than alternatives. It was said to be the first of any kind of finished work of art made of concrete. Before the completion of Millennium Park in 2004, it was considered the most important installation in the Chicago Park District. Time is one of several Chicago works of art funded by Benjamin Ferguson's trust fund.|$|E
5|$|Rhodium is a hard, silvery, <b>durable</b> {{metal that}} has a high reflectance. Rhodium metal does not {{normally}} form an oxide, even when heated. Oxygen is absorbed from the atmosphere only at the melting point of rhodium, but is released on solidification. Rhodium has both a higher melting point and lower density than platinum. It is not attacked by most acids: it is completely insoluble in nitric acid and dissolves slightly in aqua regia.|$|E
5|$|Shark skeletons {{are very}} {{different}} from those of bony fish and terrestrial vertebrates. Sharks and other cartilaginous fish (skates and rays) have skeletons made of cartilage and connective tissue. Cartilage is flexible and <b>durable,</b> yet is about half the normal density of bone. This reduces the skeleton's weight, saving energy. Because sharks do not have rib cages, they can easily be crushed under their own weight on land.|$|E
5|$|The Dutch Navy {{had already}} {{acquired}} {{a quantity of}} the Hispano Suiza 20mm guns before the war for mounting in torpedo boats and other craft and 6 of these were mounted in the cruiser Jacob van Heemskerck when she made her escape to Britain in 1940. The Hispano fired similar 20 × 110 ammunition to the Oerlikon but had a higher rate of fire and slightly higher muzzle velocity. The Hispano Suiza however was to prove insufficiently <b>durable</b> for shipboard use and would find its niche as a highly successful aircraft gun.|$|E
5|$|The Hsinchu Station is an oval-shaped {{space with}} a curved {{parallelogram}} roof. It is designed {{to respond to the}} sunlight and winds in Hsinchu. The cladding of the roof is <b>durable</b> stainless steel. It keeps the maintenance easier and enhances the high-tech image. The roof opens up over the platform and rail to avoid a piston effect and the style responds to the local environment. The station has become the new landmark of Hsinchu.|$|E
5|$|The Medway long barrows all {{conformed}} {{to the same}} general design plan, and are all aligned on an east to west axis. Each had a stone chamber at {{the eastern end of}} the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance. The chambers were constructed from sarsen, a dense, hard, and <b>durable</b> stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of silicified sand from the Eocene. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them {{to the site of the}} monument to be erected.|$|E
