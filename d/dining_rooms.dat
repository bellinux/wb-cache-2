5|$|The larger workhouses had {{separate}} <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> {{for males}} and females; workhouses without separate <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> would stagger the meal times to avoid any contact between the sexes. Rations provided for the indoor staff were {{much the same as}} those for the paupers, although more generous. The master and matron, for instance, received six times the amount of food given to a pauper.|$|E
5|$|Montacute, {{like many}} Elizabethan mansions, is built in an 'E' shape, a much-used plan in this era. On {{the ground floor}} was the great hall, kitchens and pantries, on the upper floors, {{retiring}} rooms for the family and honoured guests. Over the centuries, the layout and use of rooms changed: drawing and <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> evolved on the ground floor.|$|E
5|$|Upon opening, {{the house}} {{featured}} two <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> with student rooms arranged along lengthy hallways radiating {{from the center}} of the structure. The nine tower floors were only accessible via the ground level, from the dorm's primary entrance hall. An exterior fire escape led down the back of Jewett's tower but was replaced with an interior stairwell during the 2003 renovation.|$|E

This {{phase of the}} plan includes the extension to the <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> The extension of the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> is now finished and a new front car park for the school was finished along with renovations of the old <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
50|$|Toward the {{beginning}} of the 18th Century, a pattern emerged where the ladies of the house would withdraw after dinner from the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> to the drawing room. The gentlemen would remain in the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> having drinks. The <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> tended to take on a more masculine tenor as a result.|$|R
5|$|When the Students' Building opened, {{it stood}} two stories tall with a basement, {{as well as}} wooden pillars on its facade {{supporting}} a pediment. A cupola topped the structure and stairs beneath the pediment led to a three sets of double doors—one large, the others smaller but otherwise identical. Above each set of doors was a single large window. In the 1973 renovation, two red brick wings {{were added to the}} east and west sides of the building to accommodate numerous <b>dining</b> <b>rooms.</b> Featuring large windows, the new wings were more modern in their style than the old central portion of the building.|$|E
5|$|There was a Tudor-style foyer on the 66th {{floor with}} oak paneling, {{and an old}} English-style grill room with wooden floors, wooden beams, wrought-iron chandeliers, and glass and lead doors. The main dining room, located on the 67th floor, was {{connected}} to the 66th floor by a Renaissance-style marble and bronze staircase and had a futuristic appearance, with polished granite columns and etched glass appliques in Art Deco style. There was a mural of a cloud on the roof, and a mural of Manhattan on the dining room's north side. It is believed that the dining room was a reference for the Rainbow Room and the Rockefeller Center Luncheon Club, both located at 30 Rockefeller Center. On the same floor, Walter Chrysler and Texaco both had private <b>dining</b> <b>rooms.</b> The 68th floor mainly contained service spaces.|$|E
5|$|Until World War II, dining at Vassar was {{an elegant}} affair with table linens and serving maids, {{but after the}} war was over, these {{features}} were never brought back to student life. In 1973, the All Campus Dining Center, also called the ACDC or the Deece, opened within the building, serving as a replacement to individual <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> {{in each of the}} college's dormitories. The old system had proved too costly and overcrowded, necessitating the ACDC's creation. The $3.5 million renovation was conducted by Walker O. Cain and Associates, with over $1 million of the funds coming from friends and family of Babbott Ladd. An $11 million renovation in 2003 was designed by Finegold Alexander + Associates Inc. Another project, to renovate the kitchen of the Dining Center and adjust the locations of the building's bathrooms, is underway as of 2016. The changes, undertaken by LTL Architects, total $8–9 million.|$|E

The <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> occupies the western half of {{the first floor of}} the house, sharing the floor with the living room in its eastern half and a center hall. The <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> is as it was around 1910. An ornate mantelpiece was carved by Miss Cora Green, the daughter of a Chesterton physician.|$|R

5|$|It {{was during}} his stay in Dnipropetrovsk {{that he met}} Leonid Brezhnev, a future leader of the Soviet Union. Tikhonov joined the All-Union Communist Party (bolsheviks) in 1940 {{and by the end}} of the decade, had secured a job as a plant director. As a director, Tikhonov was able to show off his {{organisational}} skills; under his leadership the plant became the first in the region to reopen a hospital, organising <b>dining</b> <b>rooms</b> and restoring social clubs for workers caught up in the aftermath of the Eastern Front. Tikhonov was quickly promoted, and started working for the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy in the 1950s. Between 1955 and 1960 Tikhonov became a Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Ferrous Metallurgy, a member (and later chairman) of the Scientific Council of the Council of Ministers, and finally, a deputy chairman of the State Planning Committee. At the 22nd Party Congress Tikhonov was elected to the Central Committee as a non-voting member. At the 23rd party congress in 1966, Tikhonov was elected a member of the Central Committee. Tikhonov was awarded the Hero of Socialist Labour award for his first time.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, the hotel's {{first floor}} held its {{reception}} rooms, parlors, <b>dining</b> <b>rooms,</b> library, and a lounge area called the Dutch kitchen. The library was adjacent to {{and north of}} the large dining room. The ballroom had classical fluted Ionic columns and Italian marble walls. Thomas Edison was honored there in 1909. The Dutch kitchen had decorations and furnishings from Holland and {{was based on a}} restaurant in Edam. It had rough adze-hewn timbers, a hipped ceiling, etchings from England, and European and American oil paintings. Much of the furniture was purchased from Law's former employer, home furnishings pioneer W. & J. Sloane. Art and decorations throughout the building were largely were sourced from markets in Europe and Asia, and included expensive paintings, bronzes, marble sculptures, rare books, and carved antique furniture. The hotel also had a Chinese tea room and a dark room for amateur photographers. The kitchen was kept clean (such that it was proposed to serve lunches in the kitchen). It was reported to be of elegant design, utilizing white tile and marble. The kitchen equipment was of white porcelain and aluminum, and included numerous glass-lined refrigerators. It sourced its milk, butter, eggs, and vegetables from Briarcliff Farms. The kitchen's trash was frozen to prevent odors before its eventual removal; the lodge also had an ice-producing plant that used sterilized well water.|$|E

50|$|In the 1950s, {{the house}} was renovated and {{retrofitted}} with modern mechanical systems. The one-story hyphen connecting the two structures was raised to two stories. Two new bathrooms were created - one upstairs in the new hyphen space and one downstairs in the 1832 <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> just off of the hyphen hall. The Tarrys changed the <b>dining</b> <b>room</b> into a bedroom, and used the original 1797 parlor as their family <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b> They also added a kitchen adjoining and attached the original 1797 structure at that time. This kitchen was adjacent to the 1797 <b>dining</b> <b>room.</b>|$|R
