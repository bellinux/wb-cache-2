It was far from the hostilities, firmly pro-British and had excellent weather throughout the year. The British Air Ministry resolved to outsource training to the colony amid some urgency in late 1939 after EATS {{took a long time to}} <b>get</b> <b>going</b> in Canada. The RATG was the last EATS group to be formed, but the first to start training airmen; it also turned out fully qualified pilots before any of the others, doing so for the first time in November 1940.|$|E

25|$|Southport grew {{quickly in}} the 19th century as it gained a {{reputation}} for being a more refined seaside resort than its neighbour-up-the-coast Blackpool. In fact Southport had a head start compared to all the other places on the Lancashire coast because it had easy access to the canal system. Other seaside bathing areas couldn't really <b>get</b> <b>going</b> until the railways were built some years later. The Leeds and Liverpool canal brought people from Liverpool, Manchester, Bolton and Wigan amongst others. By 1820 Southport had over 20,000 visitors per year.|$|E
25|$|The USA faced Hungary in the quarterfinals. The USA {{started out}} slowly, {{with only a}} three-point lead on {{occasion}} in the first quarter.

But Tennessee {{remained}} scoreless after defensive back Todd Lyght blocked Del Greco's 47-yard field goal attempt. After that, Warner converted a third down situation with a completion to Marshall Faulk, then on the next two plays threw a 31-yard strike to wide receiver Isaac Bruce and a 16-yard completion to tight end Ernie Conwell before finishing the 68-yard drive with a 9-yard touchdown pass to Torry Holt, giving St. Louis a 16–0 lead.

Pietersen's tournament {{got off to}} a poor start as he made was dismissed for duck by Rory Kleinveldt in a warm up match. In England's first match against the West Indies, Pietersen started confidently scoring 24 from 20 balls before being dismissed on the pull by Darren Sammy. Against Ireland, he struggled to <b>get</b> <b>going,</b> scoring a slow 9 from 18 balls. In England's super eights match against Pakistan he scored 73* from 52 balls, guiding England to a 6 wicket win. In the following super eights match against South Africa, Pietersen scored an aggressive 53 runs from 33 balls, contributing to a 94 run partnership with Craig Kieswetter and a 39 run victory for England. For his performance, he was named man of the match.|$|E
25|$|Quatinga Velho is a Brazilian {{village in}} the Quatinga {{district}} of the Mogi das Cruzes municipality, which is becoming well-known because of the basic income-project which is taking place there. The project started 2008 and is organized by the non-profit organization ReCivitas. The funding {{has so far been}} based entirely on private donations. In June 2011 83 people in the village got 30 Brazilian reals per person and month. The organization hopes that all people in the village will eventually get the basic income, and also that similar projects will <b>get</b> <b>going</b> in other villages in and outside Brazil. The organizers are currently building a social bank, so that the basic income in the future can be financed through investments rather than donations. The idea is that the bank will operate as an investment bank, but the profit will go to basic income instead of a dividend to shareholders and managers. One plan is to use some of the first revenue to support the basic income project in Otjivero, Namibia, and then to initiate similar projects in different parts of Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Scotland's second {{match was}} against the United States in Northampton, {{traditionally}} a rugby union city. The Tomahawks were made up of AMNRL players but Scotland {{took a while to}} <b>get</b> <b>going.</b> In the twelfth minute winger Rory Lewis unexpected put America ahead, which caused The Bravehearts to start playing well {{for the remainder of the}} first half, Scotland eventually going into the second half leading three tries to one. Graeme Thompson had kicked a penalty very early on in the game, and then after the America try added another four points. McAlister, who had missed the conversion, set up Ketteridge and Smith for Scotland's second and third tries respectively. The Bravehearts extended their lead in the second half, Shelford going over and then David Niu, who could have played for Scotland because of his Dunfermline born mother, got one back for the States. But Scotland put a victory beyond doubt with Alan Tait setting up Shelford twice for his hat-trick. Late in the game Niu and Steve Tait scored for the United States and Scotland respectively to end the match 38–16 in Scotland's favour.|$|E

He was dismissed for 42 in the second innings to help England set South Africa and competitive target, and England {{went on to win}} the game by 241 runs. In the second Test Taylor was out for a duck in the first innings and made 27 in the second innings in a game which proved to be a high scoring draw. Taylor made 7 in the first innings of the third Test and was unbeaten at the end of the second innings as England won by seven wickets to secure a series victory. During his time in the field, Taylor had taken two wonderful catches at short leg. In the final match of the series, Taylor failed to <b>get</b> <b>going,</b> scoring 14 in the first innings as England failed to get close to South Africa's first innings score of 475. England collapsed in the second innings, being bowled out for 101, with Taylor being one of the better performers, scoring 24. Despite the defeat, England won the series 2-1, and Taylor had cemented the number five spot in the side.|$|E
25|$|Several episodes {{received}} {{extremely high}} audience figures, especially the first series. This was {{partly due to}} the fact that the main rival channel to BBC One channel in the UK, ITV, was in the middle of a long protracted strike which started in early August 1979, which saw nearly all of the local ITV companies go off air and no programmes being aired from the network (except Channel Television in the Channel Island), leaving only BBC One and BBC Two as the channels left for the British public to watch until Wednesday 24th October 1979 when ITV returned to air, with the strike ending in a pay agreement. However many viewers remained with the BBC and shows such as To The Manor Born, as ITV took some months to <b>get</b> <b>going</b> again with new programmes. For the first month after the strike had ended, ITV found it hard to win back viewers who preferred to remain with the BBC, as ITV was airing repeats and filler programmes until new content was made from November 1979. This gave To The Manor Born a huge advantage with the viewing public. In 1979, the last episode of the first series received 23.95 million viewers, the fourth-highest figures for any programme in the UK in the 1970s, and the highest for a non-live event. The following year, 21.55 million people watched the last episode of series two, the fifth-highest viewing figure for the 1980s. The final episode in 1981, when Audrey and Richard marry, received 17.80 million viewers. The 2007 Christmas special garnered 10.25 million viewers and ranked as the 6th most watched programme in the UK for that week.|$|E

The critic for The Times was largely unimpressed with You Only Live Twice, complaining that [...] "as a moderate to middling travelogue what follows will just about do... the plot with its concomitant sadism does not really <b>get</b> <b>going</b> until more than half way through".

[...] Cancellara, who was riding the event for the last time before retirement at the end of the 2016 season, was held up in Gaviria's crash after having stayed in the leading group. He described his final kilometres as difficult, as he had been isolated from his teammates, saying that the other riders mainly attacked him and did not work with him. Another rider who was almost involved when Gaviria fell was Peter Sagan, who confirmed that the peloton had covered Cancellara in particular. He went on to describe the moment of Gaviria's crash: [...] "Then I got away with Boasson Hagen, Gaviria and someone else. Then with about 500 metres to go, Gaviria looked around because the group was coming up. He went down and I only just managed to avoid him.

[...] Bushnell noted that Bell had [...] "spent {{most of the season}} standing on the sideline waiting to be inserted into the lineup for a few plays."

[...] Bell noted {{at the time that the}} lack of playing time held him back: [...] "It takes me about a quarter or so to <b>get</b> <b>going,</b> break a sweat and get the legs loosened up.
