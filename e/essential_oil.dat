40|$|Introduction. One of the {{important}} sources of therapeutic and prophylactic agents of modern medicines are <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> of medicinal plants. <b>Essential</b> <b>oils</b> are the main group of biologically active substances {{of a number of}} plants belonging to Lamiaceae Juss. Family. Antibacterial activity of medicinal plants belonging to Lamiaceae Family many scientists associated with containing of <b>essential</b> <b>oils.</b> In this regard, considerable interest presents the comparative analysis of the antimicrobial properties of <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> of Lamiaceae Family representatives. Material and methods. The antimicrobial activity of <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> of investigated plants was studied with using in vitro condition. The <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> derived from the aerial parts of cultivated plants of Ocimum, Hyssopus, Dracocephalum, Lophanthus, Monarda and Satureja genus harvested during flowering period (in terms of Ternopil region). The antimicrobial activity of <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> studied plants was studied by serial dilution method and disk diffusion assay. It has been applied on standard microorganism test strains: Bacillus subtilis ATCC 6633, Escherichia coli ATCC 25922, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 and Candida albicans ATCC 885 - 653. Results and discussion. It was conducted a comparative study of the influence of some <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> of cultivated plants belonging to Lamiaceae family on microorganisms in conditions in vitro. It was found that <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> of the studied plants were most effective in the maximum concentration (1 : 10). Gram-positive cocci S. aureus and yeast C. albicans were the most sensitive to influence of investigated <b>essential</b> <b>oils.</b> It was analyzed the relationship of the biological activity with the component composition of <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> of plants. <b>Essential</b> <b>oils</b> of L. anisatus, M. fistulosa and S. hortensis characterized by the dominance of aromatic compounds and had shown stronger antimicrobial activity than <b>essential</b> <b>oils</b> of other species.
