Smoking was also banned not only <b>in</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> institutions, but also in several public offices and in rest homes. Midwives were restricted from smoking while on duty. In 1939, the Nazi Party outlawed smoking in all of its offices premises, and Heinrich Himmler, the then chief of the Schutzstaffel (SS), restricted police personnel and SS officers from smoking while they were on duty. Smoking was also outlawed in schools.|$|E

5|$|The {{role that}} gender plays <b>in</b> <b>health</b> <b>care</b> access can be {{determined}} by examining resource allocation within the household and public sphere. Gender discrimination begins before birth; females are the most commonly aborted sex in India. If a female fetus is not aborted, the mother’s pregnancy can be a stressful experience, due to her family’s preference for a son. Once born, daughters are prone to being fed less than sons, especially when there are multiple girls already in the household. As women mature into adulthood, many of the barriers preventing them from achieving equitable levels of health stem from the low status of women and girls in Indian society, particularly in the rural and poverty-affected areas.|$|E
5|$|By 1900, {{the lumber}} {{industry}} had declined, and the city's economic base rested on other industries, including a furniture factory, a paper mill, a fire brick plant, and a silk mill. In 1938, the Piper Aircraft Corporation, {{maker of the}} Piper Cub and other light aircraft, moved its production plant to Lock Haven. It remained one of the city's biggest employers until the 1980s, when, after major flood damage and losses related to Hurricane Agnes in 1972, it moved to Florida. The loss of Piper Aircraft contributed to an unemployment {{rate of more than}} 20% in Lock Haven in the early 1980s, though the rate had declined to about 9% by 2000.

40|$|Abstract Background Understanding the {{strategies}} that <b>health</b> <b>care</b> providers employ <b>in</b> order to invite men to participate <b>in</b> maternal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> is very vital especially in today's dynamic cultural environment. Effective utilization of such strategies {{is dependent on}} uncovering the salient issues that facilitate male participation <b>in</b> maternal <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> This paper examines and describes {{the strategies}} that were used by different <b>health</b> <b>care</b> facilities to invite husbands to participate <b>in</b> maternal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> <b>in</b> rural and urban settings of southern Malawi. Methods The data was collected through in-depth interviews from sixteen of the twenty <b>health</b> <b>care</b> providers from five different <b>health</b> facilities <b>in</b> rural and urban settings of Malawi. The health facilities comprised two health centres, one district hospital, one mission hospital, one private hospital and one central hospital. A semi-structured interview guide was used to collect data from <b>health</b> <b>care</b> providers {{with the aim of}} understanding strategies they used to invite men to participate <b>in</b> maternal <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> Results Four main strategies were used to invite men to participate <b>in</b> maternal <b>health</b> <b>care.</b> The strategies were; <b>health</b> <b>care</b> provider initiative, partner notification, couple initiative and community mobilization. The <b>health</b> <b>care</b> provider initiative and partner notification were at health facility level, while the couple initiative was at family level and community mobilization was at village (community) level. The community mobilization had three sub-themes namely; male peer initiative, use of incentives and community sensitization. The sustainability of each strategy to significantly influence behaviour change for male participation <b>in</b> maternal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> is discussed. Conclusion Strategies to invite men to participate <b>in</b> maternal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> were at <b>health</b> facility, family and community levels. The couple strategy was most appropriate but was mostly used by educated and city residents. The male peer strategy was effective and sustainable at community level. There is need for creation of awareness in men so that they sustain their participation <b>in</b> maternal <b>health</b> <b>care</b> activities of their female partners {{even in the absence of}} incentives, coercion or invitation. </p...|$|R
