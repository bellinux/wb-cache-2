50|$|In contrast, an induced F → S phase {{transition}} occurs through {{a region of}} congested traffic that initially emerged at a different road location downstream from the bottleneck location. Normally, this is {{in connection with the}} upstream propagation of a synchronized flow region or a wide moving jam. An empirical example of an induced breakdown at a bottleneck leading to synchronized flow can be seen in Figure 3: synchronized flow emerges through the upstream propagation of a wide moving jam.The existence of empirical induced traffic breakdown (i.e., empirical induced F →S {{phase transition}}) means that a F → S phase transition occurs in a metastable state of <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> at a highway bottleneck. The term metastable <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> means that when small perturbations occur in <b>free</b> <b>flow,</b> the state of <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> is still stable, i.e., <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> persists at the bottleneck. However, when larger perturbations occur in <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> in a neighborhood of the bottleneck, the <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> is unstable and synchronized flow will emerge at the bottleneck.|$|R

5000|$|There is {{a maximum}} highway {{capacity}} : If the flow rate {{is close to}} the maximum capacity , then even small disturbances in <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> at a bottleneck will lead to a spontaneous F → S phase transition. On the other hand, only very large disturbances in <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> at the bottleneck will lead to a spontaneous F → S phase transition, if the flow rate is close to a minimum capacity [...] (see, for example, Sec. 17.2.2 of the book). The probability of a smaller disturbance in <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> is much higher than that of a larger disturbance. Therefore, the higher the <b>flow</b> rate in <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> at a bottleneck, the higher the probability of the spontaneous F → S phase transition. If the <b>flow</b> rate in <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> is lower than the minimum capacity , there will be no traffic breakdown (no F →S phase transition) at the bottleneck.|$|R

Micro <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> electrophoresis is a separation technique that continuously separates analyte streams as they travel through an electric field applied perpendicularly to the flow in a microfluidic device. The continuous {{nature of this}} separation technique makes it an ideal choice {{for a number of}} applications including long term continuous monitoring and as a second dimension separation technique in a two dimensional separation scheme. In order for micro <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> electrophoresis devices to reach their full potential in these applications, improvements to the stability of separated analyte streams and zero dead volume connections to these devices must be addressed. This work will detail a simple, yet effective, way for mitigating the effects of electrolysis bubbles on analyte stream stability in micro <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> electrophoresis devices by addition of surfactant or organic modifier to the electrolyte carrier buffer. The longest stable micro <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> electrophoresis separation performed on our devices is shown to support the effectiveness of this approach. An approach for making zero dead volume connections to micro <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> electrophoresis devices will also be detailed. The first two dimensional separation performed with a micro <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> electrophoresis device as the second separation dimension is shown to support the effectiveness of this interface. Finally, the fabrication and operation of a microchip electrophoresis-micro <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> electrophoresis device for seamless integration of two separation dimensions is shown...|$|R

50|$|Kerner’s {{hypothesis}} is that homogeneous synchronized flow can occur anywhere in a two-dimensional region (2D) of the flow-density plane (2D-region S in Figure 4(a)). The set of possible <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> states (F) overlaps in vehicle density the set of possible states of homogeneous synchronized <b>flow.</b> The <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> states on a multi-lane road and states of homogeneous synchronized flow are separated by {{a gap in the}} flow rate and, therefore, by a gap in the speed at a given density: at each given density the synchronized flow speed is lower than the <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> speed.|$|R
40|$|The {{fundamental}} diagram of a road, including <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> capacity and queue discharge rate, {{is very important}} for traffic engineering purposes. In the real word, most traffic measurements come from stationary loop detectors. This paper proposes a method to fit Wu’s {{fundamental diagram}} to loop detector data. Wu’s fundamental diagram is characterised by five parameters, being the <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> speed, wave speed, <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> capacity, queue discharge rate and jam density. The fits appear to be not very sensitive to the right value for the wave speed or the <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> speed. The proposed method therefore entails fixing these two parameters. The method consists of two steps. We first use a triangular fundamental diagram to separate the congested branch from the <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> branch. Then, the remaining three parameters of Wu’s fundamental diagram are fitted on each of the branches using a least square fit. This method is shown to be robust for cases tested in real life, and hence very noisy, data. Transport and PlanningCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R

50|$|In Kerner's {{three phase}} traffic theory, in {{addition}} to the <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> traffic phase (F), there are two traffic phases in congested traffic: the synchronized flow traffic phase (S) and the wide moving jam phase. One of the main results of Kerner's theory is that traffic breakdown at a highway bottleneck is a random (probabilistic) phase transition from <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> to synchronized flow (F → S transition) that occurs in a metastable state of <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> at a highway bottleneck. This basic result of Kerner's theory shows the incommensurability of three-phase traffic theory with all earlier traffic flow theories.|$|R
50|$|Kerner’s {{three-phase}} {{traffic theory}} {{is an alternative}} theory of traffic flow.

The range of highway capacities of <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> at the bottleneck in three-phase traffic theory contradicts fundamentally classical traffic theories as well as methods for traffic management and traffic control which at any time instant assume {{the existence of a}} particular deterministic or stochastic highway capacity of <b>free</b> <b>flow</b> at the bottleneck.|$|R
