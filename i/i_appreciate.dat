5|$|Shout-out to Mariah Carey and {{her whole}} squad and my boy Chris Lighty. He got me and Mariah together. <b>I</b> <b>appreciate</b> it. He {{put me on}} there as well as her. Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E

500|$|On May 18, 2011, 4s {{release date}} in the United States was {{confirmed}} on to be June 28. On June 7, the album was leaked onto the Internet in full; Beyoncé's legal representatives issued warnings to infringing websites and leaked tracks were soon removed from such sites. On June 9, Beyoncé responded to the leak through Facebook, commenting, [...] "My music was leaked and while {{this is not how}} I wanted to present my new songs, <b>I</b> <b>appreciate</b> the positive response from my fans. When I record music I always think about my fans singing every note and dancing to every beat. I make music to make people happy and <b>I</b> <b>appreciate</b> that everyone has been so anxious to hear my new songs." [...] Following the leak, reports circulated that Columbia Records executives hoped to cover their assets in fear that the album may be a commercial failure. Rumors had suggested that the label requested from Beyoncé to make changes to the record and reunite Destiny's Child, claims Columbia denied. In August 2013, NME reported that Sony Music were suing a 47-year-old man from Gothenburg for US$233,000 concerning the leak of 4. The deluxe version was released simultaneously with the standard edition in several countries. In the United States, it was available exclusively through Target stores.|$|E

500|$|At the October 30, 2007 {{debate in}} Philadelphia and the November 15 debate in Las Vegas, Biden was noted for some one-liners that drew some {{laughter}} from the audience. First, when speaking about Rudy Giuliani at the Philadelphia debate, Biden stated, [...] "There's only three things he mentions in a sentence: a noun, and a verb and 9/11." [...] At the Las Vegas debate Biden seemed to attack all his opponents when he stated, [...] "I know there's more to say, Campbell. <b>I</b> <b>appreciate</b> you asking me the question and I'm sorry I answered it.

500|$|Robinson's Hollywood exploits, however, did not {{sit well}} with Dodgers {{co-owner}} Walter O'Malley, who referred to Robinson as [...] "Rickey's prima donna". In late 1950, Rickey's contract as the Dodgers' team President expired. Weary of constant disagreements with O'Malley, and with no hope of being re-appointed as President of the Dodgers, Rickey cashed out his one-quarter financial interest in the team, leaving O'Malley in full control of the franchise. Rickey shortly thereafter became general manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates. Robinson was disappointed at the turn of events and wrote a sympathetic letter to Rickey, whom he considered a father figure, stating, [...] "Regardless of what happens to me in the future, it all can be placed on what you have done and, believe me, <b>I</b> <b>appreciate</b> it." ...|$|E
500|$|The mixtape samples {{songs from}} Radiohead, Coldplay, MGMT, Mr. Hudson and The Eagles, which Ocean sings over. Ocean, when {{uploading}} the album to iTunes, labeled it as bluegrass and death metal, out of arbitrariness. When asked {{about why he}} uploaded the songs in that way, he replied; [...] "I don't want to seem like I have a cause against genres, or maybe I do... Bluegrass is swag. Bluegrass is all the way swag." [...] Ocean described the making of his mixtape as a labor of love, stating that [...] "It was like difficult to make. Not like writing the songs [...] arranging the songs. That had a level of difficulty, too. But just piecing together all the levels {{to do it at}} the level, the quality of records I wanted to make… But, it was a process <b>I</b> <b>appreciate</b> so much." ...|$|E

500|$|Ellen Kathleen Pompeo {{was born}} in Everett, Massachusetts, on November 10, 1969, the {{daughter}} of Kathleen B. (née O'Keefe) and Joseph E. Pompeo. Her father was of Italian, English, and Irish descent, while her mother was of Irish ancestry. She was raised Roman Catholic. Her mother died of a painkiller overdose when Ellen was five, and her father remarried soon after; he died on September 1, 2012. In 2006, Pompeo told Allure [...] "I think having my mother die at such {{a very young age}} – when she was 33 – <b>I</b> <b>appreciate</b> life so much." [...] She has five siblings: three sisters and two brothers. She was nicknamed [...] "the pencil", and [...] "stracciatella" [...] (Italian Ice Cream flavor). Pompeo worked as a bartender in Miami when she started dating fashion photographer Andrew Rosenthal. Together, they moved to New York City in 1995 where she was approached by a casting director to appear in commercials for Citibank and L'Oreal.|$|E
500|$|Reception of Super Columbine Massacre {{has been}} {{extremely}} negative amongst the mainstream media and those personally affected by the shootings. Upon revealing Columbine's identity as Ledonne, Kovacs said [...] "One of the girls who died [...] {{was a friend of}} mine, Rachel. We were in the same church group. Anyone playing this game can kill Rachel over and over again." [...] The father of one victim remarked to the press that the game [...] "disgusts me. You trivialize the actions of two murderers and the lives of the innocent." [...] One victim of the shooting played the game and voiced reserved support, remarking that [...] "It probably sounds a bit odd for someone like me to say, but <b>I</b> <b>appreciate</b> the fact at least to some degree that something like this was made." [...] While he took issue with what he saw as glamorization of the shooters, he also believed it would help open a dialogue about the shooting.|$|E
500|$|Rowan Kaiser, of The A.V. Club, gave a mixed {{review of}} the episode, commenting on the show's {{increasing}} focus on rape. He wrote that [...] "There are things that <b>I</b> <b>appreciate</b> about the focus on rape. [...] It's fairly rare for a show to treat rape from the victim's perspective." [...] However, {{he went on to}} state that he had [...] "pretty significant issues" [...] with the subject matter as well. He also disapproved of the killer's choice of victims, setting, and new characters, especially Piz. Television Without Pity gave the episode a [...] "B". Reviewer Alan Sepinwall was fairly positive towards the episode. He was mixed towards the inclusion of the Kendall-Keith-Cormac storyline in the premiere, but he also praised the new cast members: [...] "Piz and Parker both add new colors to the gang, though it's hard to say what Parker will be like post-rape." [...] He eventually called the episode a [...] "pretty good start".|$|E

500|$|Lyrically [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] {{describes}} {{a day in}} the life of Madonna, with the singer working through her schedule. The verses during the chorus are representative of how Madonna had previously ignored her detractors, instead choosing to express it with her music with the lines, [...] "I'm moving fast, Can you follow my track, I'm livin' fast, And I like it like that, I do ten things all at once, And if you have a problem, I don't give a." [...] During the bridge, the lyrics presumably talks about a marriage which did not work out for unknown reasons, [...] "I tried to be a good girl/ I tried to be your wife/ I diminished myself/ And I swallowed my light." [...] Many critics agreed that the song has pretty direct lyrics that seem to take aim at her ex-husband, film director Guy Ritchie. However, when asked if Ritchie was indeed the subject of the song, Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg added that [...] " [...] has not explained the lyrics and if they are about someone specifically ... <b>I</b> <b>appreciate</b> that people will speculate." [...] The song ends with Minaj uttering the final line, [...] "There's only one queen and that's Madonna. Bitch!" ...|$|E
500|$|Starlog {{magazine}} {{reported in}} 1993 that the reception from female fans of Star Trek was mostly negative {{due to the}} manner in which Kamala was presented, while some reviewers offered a similar opinion. Michelle Erica Green, in her review for TrekNation in 2013, praised the chemistry between Stewart and Janssen but called it [...] "a terrible episode, an enormous setback in terms of how Next Gen presents women in the 24th century, and the fact that <b>I</b> <b>appreciate</b> several of the performances doesn't mean I don't wish it had never been produced." [...] She questioned that if Kamala's gender was switched about whether the arguments presented in the episode would have remained, and felt it was a missed opportunity to tackle social issues. Keith DeCandido hated the episode in his review for Tor.com in 2012, giving it a score of 2 out of 10, and said that when he first watched it, the episode had left him [...] "seething". He explained that he would [...] "expect a storyline rooted in tiresomely traditional gender roles from a show airing in the late 1960s. Not so much the early 1990s." [...] He said that Janssen was [...] "flat", and did not have any chemistry with Stewart. DeCandido also criticized the Ferengi [...] "at their absolute worst" [...] and the absence of Deanna Troi from the episode.|$|E
500|$|Fink {{does not}} know how long her {{character}} will be featured on Glee. When asked about what she likes about her character, Fink said: [...] "I think what I love about Lauren is she's so strong and so confident and she knows what she wants and I feel very blessed to play a role model for people who have ever felt other or different. I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What <b>I</b> <b>appreciate</b> about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta this year with its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren. And while the tough-only-on-the-outside Lauren can deliciously out-sass Santana Lopez, it's her straight-talking that really has me sold." ...|$|E

500|$|Ahead of {{the fourth}} season, Collider.com's Kayti Burt opined that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is [...] "the X-Men TV show you should be watching". Burt noted that the X-Men film {{franchise}} was expanding to television with the series Legion, but that S.H.I.E.L.D. already served that purpose well, highlighting {{the similarities between the}} X-Men and the Inhumans, both creations of Stan Lee and Jack Kirby during the 1960s consisting of a large group of super-powered people who [...] "are our neighbors and our friends ... both heroes and villains", and face [...] "the same fears and prejudices" [...] from the wider community. Burt felt that the similarities between S.H.I.E.L.D.s Inhumans and the X-Men became [...] "particularly pointed" [...] in the third season with the Hive storyline, which had a lot in common with the film [...] that was released around the same time; Burt was of the opinion that S.H.I.E.L.D. executed the storyline [...] "much better" [...] than the film did. Other similarities Burt discussed were the series diverse and ensemble cast, its take on the mutant cure storyline, the parallels between Daisy Johnson's second season arc and the introduction of Rogue in the first X-Men film, and its social and political commentary. With the latter, Burt also discussed the similarities between the Watchdogs and Donald Trump, calling it [...] "not very subtle, but social commentary doesn't have to be. <b>I</b> <b>appreciate</b> that Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. is attempting to comment on the current socio-political state of the country in a way that many of the other superhero TV shows don't even attempt to do. It's perhaps the show's most X-Men-like quality." [...] Concluding, Burt said that though the X-Men characters cannot appear in the MCU due to 20th Century Fox holding the rights, [...] "we still get to enjoy many of the themes prominent in the X-Men universe through S.H.I.E.L.D." ...|$|E
