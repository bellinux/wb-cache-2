5|$|Cartman {{is usually}} {{depicted}} wearing winter attire {{which consists of}} a red coat, brown pants, yellow gloves/mittens, and a yellow-brimmed turquoise knit cap tapered with a yellow pom-pom. He has parted brown hair, and he is seen without his hat more often than the other characters with distinctive headwear. As he is overweight, his body is wider, his hands noticeably larger and his head <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> elliptical shape {{in contrast to the}} circular heads of the other children. An additional curved line on his lower face represents a double chin.|$|E
5|$|He {{moved on}} {{in the summer of}} 759; this has {{traditionally}} been ascribed to famine, but Hung believes that frustration <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> likely reason. He next spent around six weeks in Qinzhou (now Tianshui, Gansu province), where he wrote more than sixty poems.|$|E
5|$|In some {{versions}} of the poem, considered older, Lalli's weapon was a sword. The axe was the murder weapon of Saint Olaf, who was very popular in Finland and may have influenced Henry's legend. However, since Lalli is not portrayed {{as a member of}} the upper class, it is unlikely that he possessed an expensive weapon like a sword, and the axe <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> historically likely choice for Henry's murder.|$|E
50|$|The {{characters}} of Paco Román and Eduardo Rusca, who <b>were</b> portrayed in <b>a</b> character triptych with Luna in the film, were written to be polar opposites. Román would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> controlled, logical character who would help bring out <b>a</b> <b>more</b> controlled side of Luna, while Rusca would <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> passionate character who could provide moments of levity throughout the film.|$|R

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that aposematism and mimicry is less evident in marine invertebrates than terrestrial insects because predation <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> intense selective force for many insects, which also disperse as adults rather than as larvae and have much shorter generation times. Further, {{there is evidence that}} fish predators such as blueheads may adapt to visual cues more rapidly than do birds, making aposematism less effective.|$|E
5|$|M. l. lamberti is the {{nominate}} subspecies from coastal eastern Australia and {{the original}} form described by Vigors and Horsfield in 1827. Unlike other subspecies, {{the head of a}} male in breeding plumage <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> uniform blue, with the crown azure and ear coverts lighter. It also has a blue rather than purple back.|$|E
5|$|Métis {{scholars}} {{have noted that}} Riel <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> important figure to non-Métis than to Métis; {{he is the only}} Métis figure most non-Métis are aware of. Political scientists such as Thomas Flanagan have pointed out certain parallels between Riel's following during the North-West Rebellion and millenarian cults.|$|E

5|$|Quenching {{involves}} {{heating the}} steel {{to create the}} austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil. This rapid cooling results in a hard but brittle martensitic structure. The steel is then tempered, {{which is just a}} specialized type of annealing, to reduce brittleness. In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects. The result <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> ductile and fracture-resistant steel.|$|E
5|$|Season mode was {{replaced}} with Road to WrestleMania in WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2009, and remained in the games until WWE '12. In this mode, players could choose from superstars to play as in single-player or multi-player storylines. The difference is that each storyline is tailor made for the superstar the player chooses. This mode <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> authentic experience and less arcade-like than the former season mode was.|$|E
5|$|Surface tension has the {{dimension}} of force per unit length, or of energy per unit area. The two are equivalent, but when referring to energy per unit of area, {{it is common to}} use the term surface energy, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> general term {{in the sense that it}} applies also to solids.|$|E

It is found among granite rocks in association with the candlebark (Eucalyptus rubida).|$|E
5|$|The {{brown creeper}} has {{sometimes}} been {{considered to be a}} subspecies of Eurasian treecreeper, but has closer affinities to short-toed treecreeper, and is normally now treated as a full species. Hodgson's treecreeper <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> recent proposed split following studies of its cytochrome b mtDNA sequence and song structure that indicate that it may well be a distinct species from C. familiaris.|$|E

5|$|The eSATA {{connector}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> robust SATA connector, {{intended for}} connection to external hard drives and SSDs. eSATA's transfer rate (up to 6Gbit/s) {{is similar to}} that of USB3.0 (up to 5Gbit/s on current devices; 10Gbit/s speeds via USB3.1, announced on 31 July 2013). A device connected by eSATA appears as an ordinary SATA device, giving both full performance and full compatibility associated with internal drives.|$|E
5|$|The hoot is a short, soft {{call and}} is {{another form of}} contact call. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> {{intimate}} call than the wail and is used exclusively between small family groups or flocks. The common loon hoots to let other family or flock members know where it is. This call is often heard when the adult loon is summoning its chicks to feed.|$|E

5|$|The {{people of}} Uttar Pradesh dress {{in a variety}} of {{traditional}} and Western styles. Traditional styles of dress include colourful draped garments—such as sari for women and dhoti or lungi for men—and tailored clothes such as salwar kameez for women and kurta-pyjama for men. Men often sport head-gear like topi or pagri. Sherwani <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> formal male dress and is frequently worn along with chooridar on festive occasions. European-style trousers and shirts are also common among the men.|$|E

5|$|The shark tourist {{industry}} has some financial leverage in conserving this animal. A single set of great white jaws can fetch up to £20,000. That is {{a fraction of}} the tourism value of a live shark; tourism <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>more</b> sustainable economic activity than shark fishing. For example, the dive industry in Gansbaai, South Africa consists of six boat operators with each boat guiding 30 people each day. With fees between £50 and £150 per person, a single live shark that visits each boat can create anywhere between £9,000 and £27,000 of revenue daily.|$|E
