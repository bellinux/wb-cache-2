40|$|Physical {{properties}} of lithium under extreme pressures continuously reveal unexpected features. These include {{a sequence of}} structural transitions to lower symmetry phases, metal-insulator-metal transition, superconductivity {{with one of the}} highest elemental transition temperatures, and a maximum followed by a minimum in its melting line. The instability of the bcc structure of lithium is well established by the presence of a temperature-driven martensitic phase transition. The boundaries of this phase, however, have not been previously explored above 3 GPa. All higher pressure phase boundaries are either extrapolations or inferred based on indirect evidence. Here we explore the pressure dependence of the martensitic transition of lithium up to 7 GPa using a combination of neutron and X-ray scattering.

We develop a winding number expansion method to accurately project out the particle number from the fermion determinant which greatly extends the applicable range of baryon number sectors to make the study feasible. Our lattice simulation was carried out with the clover fermions and improved gauge action. For a given temperature, we calculate the baryon chemical potential from the canonical approach {{to look for the}} mixed phase as a signal for the first order phase transition. In the case of N_f= 4, we observe an "S-shape" structure in the chemical potential-density plane due to the surface tension of the mixed phase in a finite volume which is a signal for the first order phase transition. We use the Maxwell construction to determine the phase boundaries for three temperatures below T_c. The intersecting point of the two <b>extrapolated</b> <b>boundaries</b> turns out to be at the expected first order transition point at T_c with μ = 0.

40|$|We have {{experimentally}} {{measured the}} distribution of the second-harmonic intensity that is generated inside a highly scattering slab of porous gallium phosphide. Two complementary techniques for determining the distribution are used. First, the spatial distribution of second-harmonic light intensity at the side of a cleaved slab has been recorded. Second, the total second-harmonic radiation at each side of the slab has been measured for several samples at various wavelengths. By combining these measurements with a diffusion model for second-harmonic generation that incorporates <b>extrapolated</b> <b>boundary</b> conditions, we present a consistent picture of {{the distribution of}} the second-harmonic intensity inside the slab. We find that the ratio l(2 w) /L(c) of the mean free path at the second-harmonic frequency to the coherence length which was suggested by some earlier calculations, cannot describe the second-harmonic yield in our samples.

40|$|The one-group {{diffusion}} theory of molten salt reactors in a homogeneous reactor model is revisited. First, the integral {{terms in the}} equation for the flux, obtained after {{the elimination of the}} delayed neutron precursors, are given a physical interpretation. This gives an understanding of the physical meaning of the concept of infinite fuel recirculation velocity, which eliminates one of the two integral terms, introduced in earlier work in order to find analytic solutions. In the light of the physical interpretation, another approximation, representing a different limiting case can be defined, corresponding to long recirculation times, i. e. no recirculation of the delayed neutron precursors to the core. This approximation incurs the neglecting of the other integral term, and it can also be solved analytically. Finally it is shown that the full equation, without neglecting any of the integral terms, has also a compact analytical solution and it is demonstrated how the case of the infinite velocity can be obtained as a limit case of the full solution. The analytical solutions open up the possibility to study a number of questions in analytical form, such as the calculation of the point kinetic response of the reactor, or the effect of the different boundary conditions.

40|$|Using {{the method}} of images, we examine the three {{boundary}} conditions commonly applied {{to the surface of}} a semi-infinite turbid medium. We find that the image-charge configurations of the partial-current and extrapolated-boundary conditions have the same dipole and quadrupole moments and that the two corresponding solutions to the diffusion equation are approximately equal. In the application of diffusion theory to frequency-domain photon-migration (FDPM) data, these two approaches yield values for the scattering and absorption coefficients that are equal to within 3 %. Moreover, the two boundary conditions can be combined to yield a remarkably simple, accurate, and computationally fast method for extracting values for optical parameters from FDPM data. FDPM data were taken both at the surface and deep inside tissue phantoms, and the difference in data between the two geometries is striking. If one analyzes the surface data without accounting for the boundary, values deduced for the optical coefficients are in error by 50 % or more. As expected, when aluminum foil was placed on the surface of a tissue phantom, phase and modulation data were closer to the results for an infinite-medium geometry. Raising the reflectivity of a tissue surface can, in principle, eliminate the effect of the boundary. However, we find that phase and modulation data are highly sensitive to the reflectivity in the range of 80 - 100 %, and a minimum value of 98 % is needed to mimic an infinite-medium geometry reliably.

40|$|Routine {{measurements}} of the solar magnetic field are mainly {{carried out in the}} photosphere. Therefore, one has to infer the field strength in the higher layers of the solar atmosphere from the measured photospheric field {{based on the assumption that}} the corona is force-free. Meanwhile, those measured data are inconsistent with the above force-free assumption. Therefore, one has to apply some transformations to these data before nonlinear force-free extrapolation codes can be applied. Extrapolation codes in cartesian geometry for modelling the magnetic field in the corona do not take the curvature of the Sun's surface into account and can only be applied to relatively small areas, e. g., a single active region. Here we apply a method for nonlinear force-free coronal magnetic field modelling and preprocessing of photospheric vector magnetograms in spherical geometry using the optimization procedure. We solve the nonlinear force-free field equations by minimizing a functional in spherical coordinates over a restricted area of the Sun. We extend the functional by an additional term, which allows to incorporate measurement error and treat regions with lacking observational data. We use vector magnetograph data from the Synoptic Optical Long-term Investigations of the Sun survey (SOLIS) to model the coronal magnetic field. We study two neighbouring magnetically connected active regions observed on May 15 2009. For vector magnetograms with variable measurement precision and randomly scattered data gaps (e. g., SOLIS/VSM) the new code yields field models which satisfy the solenoidal and force-free condition significantly better as it allows deviations between the <b>extrapolated</b> <b>boundary</b> field and observed boundary data within measurement errors. Data gaps are assigned to an infinite error. We extend this new scheme to spherical geometry and apply it for the first time to real data. Comment: Accepted on Astronomy and Astrophysic...|$|E
40|$|The {{diffusion}} theory model of neutron transport plays {{a crucial role}} in reactor theory since it is simple enough to allow scientific insight, and it is sufficiently realistic to study many important design problems. The neutrons are here characterized by a single energy or speed, and the model allows preliminary design estimates. The mathematical methods used to analyze such a model are the same as those applied in more sophisticated methods such as multi-group {{diffusion theory}}, and transport theory. The neutron diffusion and point kinetic equations are most vital models of nuclear engineering which are included to countless studies and applications under neutron dynamics. By the help of neutron diffusion concept, we understand the complex behavior of average neutron motion. The simplest group diffusion problems involve only, one group of neutrons, which for simplicity, are assumed to be all thermal neutrons. A more accurate procedure, particularly for thermal reactors, is to split the neutrons into two groups; in which case thermal neutrons are included in one group called the thermal or slow group and all the other are included in fast group. The neutrons within each group are lumped together and their diffusion, scattering, absorption and other interactions are described in terms of suitably average diffusion coefficients and cross-sections, which are collectively known as group constants. We have applied Variational Iteration Method and Modified Decomposition Method to obtain the analytical approximate solution of the Neutron Diffusion Equation with fixed source. The analytical methods like Homotopy Analysis Method and Adomian Decomposition Method have been used to obtain the analytical approximate solutions of neutron diffusion equation for both finite cylinders and bare hemisphere.

With the help of this method we can solve many functional equations such as ordinary, partial differential equations, integral equations and so many other equations. It does not require enough memory space in computer, free from rounding off errors and discretization of space variables. By using the excellence of these methods, we obtained the solutions which have been shown graphically...|$|E

The present distribution of metamorphic grade and age of metamorphism largely reflects pan-Superior events in the interval 2710 – 2640 Ma that occurred subsequent to coalescence of a system of island arcs, back-arcs, oceanic plateaus and microcontinents between 2720 and 2690 Ma. The distribution of metamorphic events and facies is the result of three interrelated patterns. 1) There is a relationship between subprovince type, metamorphic grade and age, with granite–greenstone subprovinces generally preserving older greenschist- to lower-amphibolite-facies events, metasedimentary subprovinces preserv-ing younger middle-amphibolite- to granulite-facies events, and high-grade gneiss subprovinces preserving the youngest events. 2) Discrete metamorphic episodes between 2720 and 2640 Ma are associated with periods of major plutonism. 3) There is a pattern of increasing complexity of metamorphic history with increasing metamorphic grade.

The {{objective is to}} demonstrate that the current studies on local (study of twin-cities or border points) and political-territorial (with fixed boundaries and limits) scales are not adequately portraying the reality of that space, especially by ignoring the Peruvian element and its influence. Drawing from natural, historical, social and economic characteristics of the area, a sketch of sub regional spaces within the three countries was made, based on mutual affinities, which would integrate into a transnational proto-region. Then, we conducted an analysis of various geographic networks originated in Peru (fresh food, industrial products, chinglings) that currently articulate and influence the region and the daily life of its inhabitants. After field visits and checking the density of geographical networks in Brazil, it was concluded that a crystallization of networks is taking place, leading to a hierarchical network of locations (urban network) polarized by Iquitos within the transnational space, which further strengthens the regional unit. At the end, it is also argued how territory-building happens in this particular regional space: horizontal forms of territorial production (everyday zonal flows) compete and supplant vertical territorial forms of production (power yields, institutions, laws and orders from extra-regional political and economic players). The transnational region appears as a mediator category of analysis between networks and the territory.

However, {{it has also}} been noted that as the Ekman number (viscosity) is lowered to less unrealistic values, the magnetic field tends to become less Earth-like. Here we define quantitative criteria for the degree of semblance of a model field with the geomagnetic field, based on the field morphology at the core–mantle boundary. We consider the ratio of the power in the axial dipole component to that in the rest if the field, the ratios between equatorially symmetric and antisymmetric and between zonal and non-zonal non-dipole components, and a measure for the degree of spatial concentration of magnetic flux at the core surface. We also briefly discuss shortcomings of possible other criteria for an Earth-like model. We test the compliance with our criteria for a large number of dynamo models driven by imposed temperatures at their inner and outer boundaries that cover the accessible parameter space. We order models according to their magnetic Reynolds number Rm (ratio of advection to diffusion of magnetic field) and magnetic Ekman number Eη (ratio between rotation period and magnetic diffusion time). Requirements for an Earth-like field morphology are that Eη < 10 − 4 and that Rm falls into a limited range that depends on Eη. Higher values of Rm are required at low values of Eη. <b>Extrapolating</b> the <b>boundaries</b> of compliant dynamos in this parameter space to the Earth's value of Eη suggests that Earth-like dynamos exist all the way between present model values and parameter values of the geodynamo.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{coupling}} methods for hybrid Navier–Stokes/molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The computational domain is split in a continuum flow region, where a finite-volume discretisation of the Navier–Stokes equations is used, {{and one or}} more particle domains, where molecular level modelling of the flow is employed. The domains are defined with a partial overlap, in which the flow states are coupled through an exchange of the velocity components. For the steady flows considered, an under-relaxed Newton iteration method is used to drive the coupled system to convergence. The main focus of the present work is on methods to impose nonperiodic boundary conditions on the particle domain(s). A particle forcing is applied in the direction normal to the particle domain boundary to impose the boundary normal velocity component. A novel aspect of the present work is the extension of this method to more general nonplanar particle domain boundaries. The main contribution of {{the paper is the}} development of a particle forcing method in the direction tangential to the domain boundary, which is based on the equivalent continuum-flow boundary shear stresses along with an iterative forcing strength adjustment based on the <b>extrapolated</b> particle <b>boundary</b> velocity. Furthermore, an adaptation scheme is presented, which uses the finite-volume flux residuals of the particle bin averaged velocity field as a truncation criterion for the iterative force-update scheme. It is demonstrated that by comparing the residual reduction for the momentum equation in the nonhomogeneous directions during the molecular dynamics simulations with that for a homogeneous direction, the forcing iteration at which the statistical noise in the velocity field dominates the uncertainty in the forcing strength can be determined. At this point the iteration can be truncated. It is shown that with adaptive schemes of this type, the total number of MD evaluations required in a coupled Navier–Stokes/MD simulation can be reduced relative to a hybrid scheme with a fixed number of forcing-strength update...|$|R
40|$|A modi_cation of the Kurganov, Noelle, Petrova central-upwind scheme [A. Kurganov et al., SIAM J. Sci. Comput., 23 (2001), pp. 707 { 740] for {{hyperbolic}} {{systems of}} conservation laws is presented. In this work, the numerical scheme {{is applied to}} a single-temperature model for compressible two-phase ow with pressure and velocity relaxations [E. Romenski et al., J. Sci. Comput., 42 (2010), pp. 68 { 95]. The system of governing equations of this model are expressed in conservative form, which is the necessary condition to use a central scheme. The numerical scheme presented {{is not based on}} the complete characteristic decomposition, but only on the information about the local speeds of propagation given by the maximum and minimum eigenvalue of the Jacobian of the uxes. We propose to use the numerical ux formulation of the central-upwind scheme in conjunction with a second-order reconstruction of the primitive variables and the MUSCL-Hancock method, where the <b>boundary</b> <b>extrapolated</b> values are evolved by half time step before the computation of the numerical uxes. To investigate the accuracy and robustness of the proposed scheme, two 1 D Riemann-problems of an air/water mixture and a 2 D shock-bubble-interaction problem are presented. Furthermore, a detailed comparison with the second order GFORCE scheme and the _rst order Lax-Friedrichs scheme is shown. To integrate the source terms an operator splitting approach is used and, under suitable conditions, it is shown that this integration can be computed analytically...|$|R
40|$|The {{basic problem}} in any field survey is to {{delineate}} bodies of similar objects {{and to make}} sure that the boundaries between map units are accurate and meaningful. Remotely sensed data cannot replace on-site investigations in soil surveys because the same color patterns, reflectance values, etc., do not always relate to the same kind of soil, even in a local survey area. But remotely sensed data is an extremely valuable tool in extending on-site observations and in locating and extending the boundaries between many map units. Field scientists should have ready access to maps of various scales and origin to aid in locating and <b>extrapolating</b> the <b>boundaries</b> between map units. Any data such as black and white or color infrared photography, Landsat MSS data, or side-looking radar is never fully satisfactory in any area. Yet a combination of these data can supplement each other and give the field surveyor another view of the survey area. There is little need to justify the use of black and white high altitude photography, color infrared photography, or Landsat data in soil survey. All have been found useful under varying conditions. The future use of color infrared images and Landsat data in soil survey will depend primarily upon the ability to provide up-to-date data quickly and at low cost. The National Cooperative Soil Survey has 511 active progressive surveys underway in 1980. About 90 to 100 new surveys are scheduled to start each year for the next 5 years. The average area for each survey now being mapped is 800, 000 acres and for new surveys about 700, 000 acres. We have a potential for using color infrared photography or Landsat MSS data, or both, for about 70 million acres each year. An agreement has been reached by several U. S. Government Agencies to obtain high altitude photography on about one third of the United States each year. Black and white 20 x 20 inch sheets and color infrared contact prints will be available a t a cost of about. 002 cents per acre, or for about $ 1300 for black and white and $ 1650 for color infrared photography for a 700, 000 acre county. New photography will be available every 3 years and the use of color infrared photography in soil surveys probably will increase considerably. The use of Landsat data in soil survey will depend upon ease of obtaining satisfactory maps, the cost of the maps, and overcoming the skepticism about the value of the data by many users. A question that we should examine is how refined do we want to make Landsat data. Soil surveyors are used to interpreting the variation in shading on aerial photography, but are not used to interpreting the symbolization and the square blocks of highly refined Landsat data. We need to examine the question of how we should present Landsat data to soil surveyors, the scales needed, and whether or not we need a cartographically correct map. Unless Landsat data can compete with the high quality color infrared and black and white photography in cost per acre, availability, and reduction in field time, its use will be severely limited...|$|R
40|$|Various {{hypotheses}} were proposed within recent {{years for the}} interpretation of the Mid Pleistocene Transition (MPT), which occurred during past 2 000 000 years (2 Myr). We here add to already existing theories on the MPT some data and model-based aspects focusing on the dynamics of the carbon cycle. We find that the average glacial/interglacial (G/IG) amplitudes in benthic &# 948; 13 C derived from sediment cores in the deep Pacific ocean increased across the MPT by ~ 40 %, while similar amplitudes in the global benthic &# 948; 18 C stack LR 04 increased by a factor of two over the same time interval. The global carbon cycle box model BICYCLE is used for {{the interpretation of the}}se observed changes in the carbon cycle. Our simulation approach is based on regression analyses of various paleo-climatic proxies with the LR 04 benthic &# 948; 18 C stack over the last 740 kyr, which are then used to <b>extrapolate</b> changing climatic <b>boundary</b> conditions over the whole 2 Myr time window. The observed dynamics in benthic &# 948; 13 C cannot be explained if similar relations between LR 04 and the individual climate variables are assumed prior and after the MPT. According to our analysis a model-based reconstruction of G/IG amplitudes in deep Pacific &# 948; 13 C before the MPT is possible if we assume a different response to the applied forcings in the Southern Ocean prior and after the MPT. This behaviour is what we call the "Southern Ocean Decoupling Hypothesis". This decoupling might potentially be caused by a different cryosphere/ocean interaction and thus changes in the deep and bottom water formation rates in the Southern Ocean before the MPT, however an understanding from first principles remains elusive. Our hypothesis is also proposing dynamics in atmospheric pCO 2 over the past 2 Myr. Simulated pCO 2 is varying between 180 and 260 &# 956;atm before the MPT. The consequence of our Southern Ocean Decoupling Hypothesis is that the slope in the relationship between Southern Ocean SST and atmospheric pCO 2 is different before and after the MPT, something for which first indications already exist in the 800 kyr CO 2 record from the EPICA Dome C ice core. We finally discuss how our findings are related to other hypotheses on the MPT...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} assumed that increased map precision (ie map unit homogeneity) and map purity (map unit accuracy) should result from increasing {{the scale of}} mapping of the soil resource, since it should enable a more intricate breakdown of the landscape into landform facet based units. This study compared the predictive success of a 1 : 10 K scale soil association map with the 1 : 25 K and 1 :lOOK scale soil landscape maps within the Birrigai area of the Paddy's river catchment, south west of Canberra, A. C. T. The 1 : 25 K and the 1 :lOOK scale soil landscape maps were also evaluated in a second larger evaluation area in the Paddy's river catchment which allowed more of the larger soil landscape map units to be evaluated. The 1 : 25 K scale soil map was produced by another author for the A. C. T Government, and was surveyed at a substantially lower survey intensity than that for the 1 :lOOK and 1 : 10 K scale soil maps (ie only 0. 05 observation sites / cm 2 of published map). These maps were evaluated using a set of randomly located independent evaluation sites in each evaluation area, and from these calculating and comparing standard Marsman & de Gruijter(1986) measures of Map Purity. The strength of soil-landscape relationships within this catchment were determined from a Fixed One Way Analysis of Variance, and from more simplistic graphical comparisons of {{the means and standard}} deviations of the discrete soil data within these landform based map units. Soil-landscape relationships for the Nominal scale soil data (ie class type data) were evaluated by comparing the Marsman & de Gruijter(1986) Homogeneity index ratings among the soil map units. Intensive survey traverses were also carried out in selected soil landscapes to further evaluate the strength of soil landscapes present. The results revealed obvious improvements in map quality associated with increasing map scale from 1 : 100, 000 to 1 : 10, 000, and these included increases in the predictive success (Map Purity), reductions in the extent of map unit impurities, and planning advantages associated with having individual land facets delineated on the 1 : 10, 000 scale map. The respectable purity ratings achieved by the 1 : 100, 000 scale soil landscape map (ie average purity rating of 63 %) was largely attributed to the flexibility of the "soil material" approach to soil landscape mapping. The relatively poor performance of the 1 : 25 K consultancy soil landscape map demonstrated the fact that; any benefit gained from the improved intricacy in the representation of map unit delineation's with increased mapping scale, will be drastically reduced if it is not matched by an associated increase in the intensity of field investigations. Evaluations of the soil-landscape relationships found that the land facets of the Paddy's river catchment generally failed to delineate areas that were both uniform and unique in respect of their soil properties. Soil-landscape relationships were instead found to be quite complex, applying to only certain land facets, and in regards to only certain soil properties. Soil maps with units based on landsurface features were recommended on the basis of the importance of other landscape factors other than soils to land capability ratings, as well as on the useability of such maps. This study recommended the adoption of a" > 2 detailed soil profile observations / land facet in each map unit" mapping standard to ensure a reasonable estimate of the variability and modal soil conditions present, as well as a reliable confirmation of the perceived soil-landscape relationships. The error usually associated with small scale mapping was effectively reduced by rapid ground truthing, involving driving along the major roads dissecting the map area and making brief observations of soil exposures on road batters, despite the bias of the road network making such mapping improvements uneven across the map. The major point to come from this study was the re-emphasising of the point that soil spatial variability has to be accepted as a "real landscape attribute" which needs to be accurately described and communicated to land users, and must not be considered as some sort of soil mapping failure. The fact that individual facets of the landscape rarely coincide with unique pockets of uniform and unique soils and soil properties must be considered simply an on the ground reality of nature, and not some mapping failure. It was thought that since other landscape factors (eg hillslope gradient) most often dominate the determination of land use suitability and capability, it is better to effectively describe the range and modal state of the soil conditions within such facets, then to attempt to <b>extrapolate</b> possible soil <b>boundaries</b> using geostatistical techniques which cut across such land facets, and mayor may not correlate with real groupings of soil properties, depending on the spatial resolution of the soil variability distribution in the landscape. Even so the results of this investigation do put the validity of the physiographic terrain class mapping model as a predictor of soil traits under question, at least for the more complex landscape settings...|$|R
