5|$|Richard and Gloucester's {{campaign}} of 1392 never happened, but Richard did leave for Ireland in 1394 {{with a large}} army, accompanied by John Othelake, who had succeeded Chandos as Ireland King of Arms in 1393. No details are given of Othelake's career as Ireland King of Arms, although he certainly had a connection with Ireland as an officer of arms to the Earl of March in 1381. The historical evidence <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> make clear how long Othelake served in the position.|$|E
5|$|The legend {{strongly}} {{emphasizes that}} Henry was a Bishop of Uppsala, not a Bishop of Finland {{which became a}} conventional claim later on, also by the church itself. He stayed in Finland out of pity, but was never appointed as a bishop there. The legend does not state whether there had been bishops in Finland before his time or what happened after his death; it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> mention his burial in Finland. The vita is so void of any concrete information about Finland {{that it could have}} been created anywhere. The Latin is scholastic and the grammar is in general exceptionally good.|$|E
5|$|Veronica {{talks to}} Sean Friedrich {{and tells him}} about the girl-on-girl event and that Dick and Beaver took her over to a bed and argued about who should have sex with her. Veronica talks to Dick, who {{presents}} a different account of events, saying that he didn't drug her and that he found Beaver with Veronica already. Veronica approaches Beaver, who gives a set of events more {{similar to that of}} Sean. However, after Dick and Sean leave, he purports to have run away and vomited before he could bring himself to rape her. Keith says that he has to leave for an engagement in Vegas. Logan talks to Aaron, but Aaron <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> know Logan's birth date. Veronica talks to Carrie Bishop (Leighton Meester), who says that she saw Veronica having sex with Duncan. Veronica confronts Duncan, who denies the rape accusations and remembers comforting Veronica in her drugged state. Duncan says that the sex was consensual even though he knew that they were siblings, confirming Veronica's fears. Veronica talks to Wallace about the events but says that she is content with the answers she has. Keith calls a prostitute in Vegas for an unknown reason, while Veronica apologizes to Logan and tells her about the situation with Duncan. Back in Vegas, Keith talks to the prostitute, Cheyenne, about Abel Koontz, as Cheyenne and Koontz were together at the time of Lilly's murder. Veronica and Logan go into his darkened house before they realize that Aaron throws a surprise party for him, meaning that virtually the entire high school knows that they are dating.|$|E

25|$|However, aid {{also has}} disadvantages. Often aid <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> reach the poorest people. Often money gained from aid is used {{up to make}} {{infrastructures}} (bridges, roads etc.), which only the rich can use. Also, the recipient country becomes more dependent on aid from a donor country (the country giving aid).|$|E
25|$|Whereas the Iron–sulfur world {{identifies}} {{a circular}} pathway {{as the most}} simple, the thermosynthesis hypothesis <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> invoke a pathway: ATP synthase's binding change mechanism resembles a physical adsorption process that yields free energy, rather than a regular enzyme's mechanism, which decreases the free energy. It has been claimed that the emergence of cyclic systems of protein catalysts is implausible.|$|E
25|$|These {{scholars}} {{felt that}} adherence to monogamy would minimise {{the risk of}} oppression because the requirement of meting out justice amongst a plurality of wives would be immensely challenging for any man. Therefore, they opined that it is preferable to avoid polygyny altogether, so one <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> come near the chance of committing the forbidden deed of dealing unjustly between the wives.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{before the}} {{demonstration}} of Pythagoras' theorem, the dialogue takes an epistemological turn when the interlocutors begin to discuss the fundamental nature of knowledge. The general question asked is how one can claim to know something when one <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> know what knowledge is. Via the Socratic method, it is shown {{that the answer to}} the question posed is innateness – one possesses a priori knowledge.|$|E
25|$|The Stadium {{does not}} have covered stands, there are no flood lights, the stadium <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> have a digital scoreboard. The stadium has no proper white screens instead it uses old school {{portable}} cloth screens. The pitch is not well-managed either, the curator uses a hand-rolled roller which makes pitch management even more difficult. There are no practical arrangements for video coverage of a match. The stadium has eight entrances and a well-built pavilion.|$|E
25|$|In the Czech Republic as of 2008, the ADSL/ADSL2+ {{coverage}} is above 90% of all fixed phone lines, however maximum attainable rates vary. In many locations, {{and even in}} major cities such as Prague or Brno, the maximum speed <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> reach 4Mbit/s because of the telephone cabling quality. Pricing plans of the biggest ADSL provider, Telefónica O2 Czech Republic, range from €23 per month for 8,192/512kbit/s to €27 per month for 16,384/768kbit/s.|$|E

25|$|Adad-nirari III died prematurely in 783 BC, {{and this}} led to a period of true stagnation. Shalmaneser IV (783-73 BC) seems to have wielded little authority, and a victory over Argishti I, king of Urartu at Til Barsip, is {{accredited}} to a general ('Turtanu') named Shamshi-ilu who <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> bother to mention his king. Shamshi-ilu also scored victories over the Arameans and Neo-Hittites, and again, takes personal credit at the expense of his king.|$|E
25|$|The Landscape {{with the}} Fall of Icarus, now {{thought to be}} an early copy, {{combines}} several elements of northern Renaissance painting. It hints at the renewed interest for antiquity (the Icarus legend), but the hero Icarus is hidden away in the background. The main actors in the painting are nature itself and, most prominently, the peasant, who <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> look up from his plough when Icarus falls. Brueghel shows man as an anti-hero, comical and sometimes grotesque.|$|E
25|$|Most organisms with {{colour vision}} {{are able to}} detect {{ultraviolet}} light. This high energy light can be damaging to receptor cells. With a few exceptions (snakes, placental mammals), most organisms avoid these effects by having absorbent oil droplets around their cone cells. The alternative, developed by organisms that had lost these oil droplets {{in the course of}} evolution, is to make the lens impervious to UV light – this precludes the possibility of any UV light being detected, as it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> reach the retina.|$|E

The people of Colorado have adopted an entirely reasonable provision which <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> disfavor homosexuals in any substantive sense, but merely denies them preferential treatment. Amendment 2 {{is designed to}} prevent piecemeal deterioration of the sexual morality favored {{by a majority of}} Coloradans, and is not only an appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that Americans have employed before. Striking it down is an act, not of judicial judgment, but of political will.|$|E
25|$|Mohammad Omar Farooq asks why Siddiqi <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> {{attempt to}} provide {{evidence}} for the social and personal corruption of charging interest, noting monitors of corruption such as Transparency International do not consider it a source of corruption. Farooq replies to Qaradawi's statement that interest leads to sloth by stating that matching the savings of savers/depositors with the capital needs of borrowers is an economically useful and competitive function, and that many savers are retired elderly of modest means who can no longer work and seek conservative ways to make money from their life savings.|$|E
25|$|The {{laughing}} falcon breeds in rock crevices, tree cavities, or occasionally in abandoned nests of a Buteo hawk or caracara; in general however it <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>even</b> gather nesting material in significant quantities. It lays {{one or two}} eggs according to some sources, but according to others always just one. The eggs have heavy dark brown markings on a brown or whitish or pale buff background. The young are thought to leave the nest eight weeks after hatching.The breeding season has been given as April and May, though it may well vary across the large range of this species.|$|E
