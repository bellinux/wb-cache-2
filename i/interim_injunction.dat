25|$|In England and Wales, a {{contract}} may be enforced {{by use of}} a claim, or in urgent cases by applying for an <b>interim</b> <b>injunction</b> to prevent a breach. Likewise, in the United States, an aggrieved party may apply for injunctive relief to prevent a threatened breach of contract, where such breach would result in irreparable harm {{that could not be}} adequately remedied by money damages.|$|E
25|$|The renovated party, {{although}} {{with a much}} smaller membership and resources (such as the former headquarters at 24 Cecil Street in Toronto and party printing press) now faced further challenges and threats to its existence. New electoral laws mandated that any political party which failed to field 50 candidates in a general federal election would be automatically de-registered and its assets seized. The CPC {{was not in a}} position to run 50 candidates in the 1993 federal election (it fielded only eight candidates during that election), and therefore its assets were seized and the party was de-listed. The CPC had sought an <b>interim</b> <b>injunction</b> to prevent its imminent de-registration, but this legal action failed.|$|E
2500|$|Commercial Radio (CR) {{reached an}} {{agreement}} with HKU on 5 November undertaking not to air any other content of the council's past or future meetings unless these had already been reported by other media, meaning compliance with {{the terms of the}} <b>interim</b> <b>injunction</b> obtained by the university a few days earlier. The presiding High Court judge expressed reservations that Leong, on behalf of HKU, was seeking a [...] "perpetual injunction on all meetings, future, past, and present". While CR's lawyer said agreement to comply with the court order did not imply that the station is compromising on press freedom, Hong Kong Journalists Association expressed disappointment at the broadcaster's decision. Pundits suggested that CR was bowing to political pressure as its broadcasting licence was up for renewal next year. The university insisted that the radio broadcaster must disclose the source of the leaked recording, which CR vowed it would never do, while a legal expert noted that privacy was not on equal footing with the freedom of information, and that legislation protecting whistleblowers was lacking in Hong Kong. At a court hearing on 6 November, the court extended the injunction to 24 November, but reduced its scope. It covers [...] "persons unknown" [...] who possess information about the five HKU council meetings held between June and October only. While HKU sought to adjourn the case, other interested parties – a legislator the HK Journalists Association, Apple Daily, and two HKU law student (one of whom being chief editor of HKU student magazine Undergrad) – joined the case seeking to have it dismissed outright. The blanket protection for future council meetings no longer applied.|$|E

40|$|Since the {{implementation}} of Directive 2004 / 48 EC on the Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights in Sweden there is today a possibility for pharmaceutical companies holding a patent to issue <b>interim</b> <b>injunctions</b> against a generic company {{on the grounds of}} an attempt or preparation to a pharmaceutical patent infringement. It has been shown that one of the earliest steps in which a generic company may infringe a pharmaceutical patent is to offer the generic drugs onto the market. However, since {{the implementation}} of the attempt and preparation rule in the Swedish Patent Act questions have been raised as to in what stage <b>interim</b> <b>injunctions</b> may be issued against an attempt or preparation to offer generic drugs onto the market made by generic companies. This thesis has therefore intent to investigate at what stage <b>interim</b> <b>injunctions</b> may be applied for against a generic company on the grounds of an attempt or preparation to offer generic drugs. In the thesis the writer argues that in order for an attempt or preparation to offer generic drugs to exist an overall assessment must be made of the particular situation and that there is no specific principles to follow in order to determine either an attempt or a preparation to offer generic drugs. However, some guidance might be brought from Danish case law in order to establish a preparation to offer generic drugs in Sweden. ...|$|R

40|$|The Coalition Government has prioritised 'open data' as a 'powerful tool' to 'empower citizens', with a 'transparency commitment' {{to publish}} more crime and {{anonymised}} sentencing {{data and the}} Ministry of Justice has set out an open data strategy covering both civil and criminal courts. However, legal researchers frequently encounter inaccessible or 'closed' data, when they attempt to access basic information concerning civil cases. Better-organised and more open information would help inform public debates relating to procedural and substantive civil law - the discussion around libel reform and privacy-related <b>interim</b> <b>injunctions,</b> for example. This paper will argue {{that a lack of}} public data about defamation and privacy litigation, indicated by the Impact Assessment for the Defamation Bill 2012 and the report by the Master of the Rolls' Committee on Super-Injunctions in 2011, hampers the policy-making process, public debate and academic research around these issues of public interest...|$|R
40|$|The {{actions that}} led to this {{particular}} case hit the national headlines, and its resulting judgment has been subject to much scrutiny (see for example M B Rodriguez Ferrez “School Disciplinary Decisions, Judicial Review and Interim Relief” NZLJ June 2015 178 - 181), so commentary on this case in relation to the issue of <b>interim</b> <b>injunctions</b> is undoubtedly of interest. The background to this case is that 10 students of St Bede’s College, Christchurch, were selected to compete in the Maadi Cup, a national rowing regatta, at Lake Karapiro in the Waikato. At Auckland airport, two students, Jack Bell and Jordan Kennedy, rode, without authorisation, on the baggage carousel in to the secure baggage area. The boys were spoken to by the police and security offices, with no further action being taken. The Rector of the College, Justin Boyle, decided to suspend the two boys, and required them to return to Christchurch. This prevented the boys from being considered for selection in trials for the national rowing team...|$|R

5000|$|Leave {{was given}} {{to appeal to the}} House of Lords, where a {{judgment}} was given on 14 October 2004 by Lord Nicholls, with the other judges assenting. In it, Nicholls said that the test required by the Human Rights Act, [...] "more likely than not", was a higher standard than [...] "a real prospect of success", and that the Act [...] "makes the likelihood of success at the trial an essential element in the court's consideration of whether to make an interim order", asserting that in similar cases courts should be reluctant to grant <b>interim</b> <b>injunctions</b> unless it can be shown that the claimant is [...] "more likely than not" [...] to succeed. At the same time, he admitted that the [...] "real prospect of success" [...] test was not necessarily insufficient, granting the appeal nonetheless because Lloyd J had ignored the public interest element of the disclosure. As the first confidentiality case brought after the Human Rights Act, Cream is the leading case used in British [...] "breach of confidentiality" [...] cases.|$|R

40|$|Legal context The {{recognition}} {{and protection of}} well-known marks in Indonesia has improved {{over the last few}} years for a variety of reasons. Key points First, the Asian Crisis resulted in the creation of a Commercial Court, which is a clear improvement over the previously responsible District Courts. Secondly, the increasingly frequent publication of court decisions has improved transparency and consistency of those decisions. Well-known marks are now clearly protected against use for similar goods/services. Protection is extended to dissimilar goods/services by applying Article 16 (3) TRIPS directly or by arguing that registration occurred in bad faith. Nevertheless, decisions thus far concern almost exclusively revocation and invalidity of registrations. Civil remedies such as damages and <b>interim</b> <b>injunctions</b> are hardly used, because the outdated civil procedural law has not familiarised judges with such legal instruments. Clearing the register of infringing registrations is another matter of concern. Cancellation for non-use for three consecutive years can be difficult, because the plaintiff is required to provide evidence of the last use in the production of the goods/services rather than in the course of trade more generally. Practical significance While it has become much easier to protect well-known marks in Indonesia, much work remains to be done regarding the procedural framework of civil infringement proceedings and regarding the clearing of the register. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Although the Court of Appeal has {{previously}} provided judicial guidance on the grant of <b>interim</b> mandatory <b>injunctions,</b> {{it is remarkable}} that local authority on grants of final mandatory injunctions is almost non-existent. In relation to breaches of contractual obligations, this may be a matter of little note since the assistance of equity will be neither necessary nor sought given the adequacy of contractual damages as a remedy for most instances of breach. Nevertheless, in a series of unreported decisions, the High Court and the Court of Appeal may have made some rather surprising inroads into this small patch of wilderness in Singapore 2 ̆ 7 s legal landscape. Clarification as to when a court might feel it to be fair to issue equitable remedies such as a final mandatory injunction and how this novel pre-requisite fits in with current learning on restrictions upon exercise of its equitable jurisdiction would not be amiss...|$|R
