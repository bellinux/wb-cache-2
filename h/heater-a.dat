2500|$|In operation, {{a current}} {{flows through the}} {{filament}} (<b>heater)—a</b> high resistance wire made of nichrome—and heats the cathode red hot (800–1000°C). This causes the cathode to release electrons into the vacuum, a process called thermionic emission. (Some valves use direct heating, in which a tungsten filament acts as both heater and cathode.) [...] The alternating voltage to be rectified is applied between the cathode and the concentric plate electrode. [...] When the plate has a positive voltage {{with respect to the}} cathode, it electrostatically attracts the electrons from the cathode, so a current of electrons flows through the tube from cathode to plate. [...] However, when the polarity is reversed and the plate has a negative voltage, no current flows, because the cathode electrons are not attracted to it. [...] The plate, being unheated, does not emit any electrons. So electrons can only flow through the tube in one direction, from the cathode to the anode plate.|$|E
