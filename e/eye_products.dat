50|$|The Pharmaceuticals {{division}} manufactures pharmaceutical <b>eye</b> <b>products,</b> {{which account}} for 21% of turnover. This range covers prescription medicines for eye irritation, allergic reactions or high eye pressure. A further breakthrough is expected from the new Envision TD product range. This represents a new process for the precisely located dispensing of active substances to the eye. This is achieved by medical implants behind the eye. Due to the body's absorption process, the implant slowly decomposes {{and in so doing}} releases the desired active substance directly to the eye over a long period. Additionally, vitamins can be dispensed to counteract bacterial infection and allergic reactions, thus reducing loss of vision with advancing age. The development of this division was speeded up by take-overs of other firms.|$|E

5000|$|In the 21st century {{billions of}} animals {{have been exposed}} to cruelty, for human’s benefit, in the United States and dozens of other {{countries}} worldwide through animal testing of consumer products. Laboratories sticking painful eye irritants into restrained rabbit’s eyes to test an <b>eye</b> <b>product</b> and cats being forced to have brain electrocutions to test for neurological pharmaceutical drugs are just two of hundreds of products tested on animals according to PETA (peta.org). Animals don’t have to be used for human’s wants. Scientists Burch and Russell created the 3Rs: reduction, refinement and replacement to further anti-vivisection. In these 3 Rs alternative successful approaches to testing consumer products have been created.
