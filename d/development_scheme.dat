A partnership between the IWM, the Museums, Libraries and Archives Council, and Scottish, Northern Irish and Welsh museum authorities, phase one included a touring exhibition seen by more than two million people, overseas educational visits and further activities run by local authorities. A second phase took a wider 20th century historical remit; it comprised a learning programme using overseas visits and social media, and a professional <b>development</b> <b>scheme</b> for educators. A digital archive of the project, online exhibitions and learning resources were also produced.|$|E
5|$|The Shires of Perth and Wanneroo {{combined}} to prepare Town Planning Scheme No.26 (Hamersley <b>Development</b> <b>Scheme),</b> and by early March 1968, the scheme, which included provisions for water supply, sewerage, drainage, road construction and undergrounding of power mains, {{was presented to}} both councils for consideration. A time limit of 3½ years for developers to construct homes on released land was built into the scheme {{in an effort to}} prevent land speculation, which the inter-departmental committee believed was a key factor in spiralling prices in Perth. By July, however, negotiations between the councils broke down, and the Shire of Perth (now City of Stirling) decided to administer its own part of the scheme independently. The scheme was divided into nine sections, with what is now the suburb of Hamersley being the first stage.|$|E

5|$|The Docks {{had been}} {{gradually}} declining from the 18th century; the larger ships being built found The Thames difficult to navigate, and Deptford was under {{competition from the}} new docks at Plymouth, Portsmouth and Chatham. When the Napoleonic Wars ended in 1815 {{the need for a}} Docks to build and repair warships declined; the Docks shifted from shipbuilding to concentrate on victualling at the Royal Victoria Victualling Yard, and the Royal Dock closed in 1869. From 1871 until the First World War the shipyard site was the City of London Corporation's Foreign Cattle Market, in which girls and women butchered sheep and cattle until {{the early part of the}} 20th century. At its peak, around 1907, over 234,000 animals were imported annually through the market, but by 1912 these figures had declined to less than 40,000 a year. The yard was taken over by the War Office in 1914, and was an Army Supply Reserve Depot in the First and Second World Wars. The site lay unused until being purchased by Convoys (newsprint importers) in 1984, and eventually came into the ownership of News International. In the mid-1990s, although significant investment was made on the site, it became uneconomic to continue using it as a freight wharf. In 2008 Hutchison Whampoa bought the 16ha site from News International with plans for a £700m 3,500-home <b>development</b> <b>scheme.</b> The Grade II listed Olympia Warehouse will be refurbished as part of the redevelopment of the site.|$|E

Bhushan said none of the normal controls were being applied, and the scheme was breeding corruption. The same year, Bhushan also represented the CPIL in a petition alleging that Pepsico and Coca-Cola were failing to warn the public of harmful ingredients in their beverages, and were luring young children through misleading advertising.|$|E

Some social workers and residents urged the government to relocate the storage facilities.

25|$|After Henry Flagler {{extended}} his rail line south from West Palm Beach to Miami in 1896, a land <b>development</b> <b>scheme</b> {{was created to}} plant a townsite between the railroad and the lake. Purchasers of agricultural lots, west of town, would also receive a small 25 foot lot within the City of Lake Worth, closer to the beach. The developer, Bryant & Greenwood, proposed to name the town Lucerne, however the United States Postal Service {{refused to accept the}} name because there already was a Lake Lucerne post office north of Miami in Dade County. Therefore, the city fathers settled on the name Lake Worth, for the lake on which the fledgling town was sited. One of the main streets was named Lucerne Avenue instead.|$|E

25|$|After {{ten years}} of gold rushes the economy slowed but Julius Vogel's {{immigration}} and <b>development</b> <b>scheme</b> brought thousands more especially to Dunedin and Otago before recession set in again in the 1880s. In these first and second times of prosperity many institutions and businesses were established, New Zealand's first daily newspaper, art school, medical school and public art gallery the Dunedin Public Art Gallery among them. There was also a remarkable architectural flowering producing many substantial and ornamental buildings. R.A. Lawson's First Church of Otago and Knox Church are notable examples, as are buildings by Maxwell Bury and F.W. Petre. The other visual arts also flourished {{under the leadership of}} W. M. Hodgkins. The city's landscape and burgeoning townscape were vividly portrayed by George O'Brien 1821–1888.From the mid-1890s the economy revived. Institutions such as the Toitū Otago Settlers Museum and the Hocken Collections – the first of their kind in New Zealand – were founded. More notable buildings such as the Railway Station and Olveston were erected. New energy in the visual arts represented by G.P. Nerli culminated in the career of Frances Hodgkins.|$|E
500|$|The name {{first came}} into use to {{describe}} the north-western section of the Perth Road District in 1906. Hamersley Ward was a large area of land covering what is now Hamersley, Carine, Watermans Bay, North Beach, Gwelup and parts of Balcatta, Karrinyup and Trigg. The Hamersley townsite, consisting of Hamersley Ward, was gazetted in 1945. As a result, many facilities in North Beach, including a primary school, a golf course, several sporting clubs and residents' and seniors' associations, were called Hamersley. After the Hamersley <b>Development</b> <b>Scheme</b> started in 1968, confusion as to exactly what Hamersley referred to led to conflict between established organisations in North Beach and emerging ones in Hamersley – the Hamersley Gazette noted in 1973 that [...] "North Beach people have the prior claim but ours is more officially accepted".|$|E
500|$|The western {{portion of}} Hamersley grew {{steadily}} {{over the following}} months and years, with segments being released, auctioned and developed by the R Bank, T Plunkett Homes and Parkland Housing. The Hamersley <b>Development</b> <b>Scheme,</b> however, was doomed almost before it started. Disagreements over issues such as undergrounding {{of power and the}} time limit clauses between the Town Planning Board and the Shire of Perth had caused delays in the scheme's approval. In July 1970, the Shire Planner reported that [...] "there is little point in proceeding with the Scheme, especially in view of the large areas already subdivided", and recommended the council agree [...] "that for all practical purposes, Town Planning Scheme No. 26. is defunct". By the February 1971 state election, over 1,000 eligible voters lived in the district.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{is the part of}} an {{empirical}} study on the role of Rural <b>Development</b> <b>Schemes</b> in the <b>Development</b> of tribal areas of Himachal Pradesh, which determined the various aspects and weakness of Rural <b>Development</b> <b>Schemes.</b> The efforts of the Government to uplift the poor masses as the state should be evaluated at micro level then at macro level. Central Government as well as state Government has launched many Rural <b>Development</b> <b>Schemes</b> for the sustainable development of the tribal areas of Himachal Pradesh. These schemes have been based on economic and socio-cultural development. Some of them create infrastructure and generate employment. The main object of all the different programs is sustainable human development. There is no significance of Rural <b>Development</b> <b>Schemes,</b> if, it will not generate employment and no significance of employment, if it will not develop the basic structure, because all the Rural <b>Development</b> <b>Schemes</b> are interlinked to each other. Many of them have achieved significant success in this direction. The aim of the tribal development programs and tribal welfare policy in India has been defined as the progressive social and economic advancement of tribal population with a view to their complete integration with the rest of people in the country. Tribal areas need special attention, if the benefits of the new developmental programs are to be accruing to the tribal community. Thus, {{in order to determine the}} effectiveness of these programs, it is important to examine the impact and performance of these programs in the rural areas, so that effective rural development programs may be designed for the betterment of the rural community...|$|R
