40|$|The {{disposable}} soma hypothesis {{predicts that}} when reproduction is reduced, life span is increased because more nutrients are {{invested in the}} soma, increasing somatic repair. Rigorously testing the hypothesis requires tracking nutrients from ingestion to allocation to the soma or to reproduction. Fruit flies on life-extending dietary restriction increase allocation to the soma “relative” to reproduction, suggesting that allocation of nutrients {{can be associated with}} extension of life span. Here, we use stable isotopes to track ingested nutrients in ovariectomized grasshoppers during the first oviposition cycle. Previous work has shown that ovariectomy extends life span, but investment of protein in reproduction is not reduced until after the first clutch of eggs is laid. Because ovariectomy does not affect investment in reproduction at this age, the disposable soma hypothesis would predict that ovariectomy should also not affect investment in somatic tissues. We developed grasshopper diets with distinct signatures of 13 C and 15 N, but that produced equivalent reproductive outputs. These diets are, therefore, appropriate for the reciprocal switches in diet needed for tracking ingested nutrients. Incorporation of stable isotopes into eggs showed that grasshoppers are income breeders, especially for carbon. Allocation to the fat body of nitrogen ingested as adults was slightly increased by ovariectomy; this was our only result that was not consistent with the disposable soma hypothesis. In contrast, ovariectomy did not affect allocation of nitrogen to <b>femoral</b> <b>muscles.</b> Further, allocation of carbon to the fat body or <b>femoral</b> <b>muscles</b> {{did not appear to be}} affected by ovariectomy.

40|$|Purpose of {{the study}} - a {{comparative}} quantitative evaluation of regional circulation state, the degree of reducing femoral and leg contractility, as well as gait disorders in male and female patients with coxarthrosis. Material and methods. The patients with stages 1, 2, and 3 coxarthrosis were examined. The mean age of female group was 47 ± 0. 7 years, that of male one - 37 ± 1, 4 years, the number of observations was 314 and 99 persons, respectively. Arterial blood pressure (ABP), locomotion rate {{and the increase in}} heart rate during walking were determined in the patients, as well as walking time parameters, distribution of foot part loading statically and dynamically (DiaSled-Scan complex), the maximum moment of strength of femoral and leg anterior and posterior muscle groups. Linear blood flow rate in magistral arteries was determined by Doppler ultrasonography. Laser Doppler flowmetry of skin anterior surface of the leg middle third, and the dorsal surface of both limb feet (BLF- 21 device of Transonic Systems, uSA) was used for capillary blood flow evaluation. Results. More rapid age-related increase in ABP and decrease in capillary blood flow rate in limb skin integuments for Stage 2 and 3 of the disease were observed in female patients above 45 years. As for Stage 3 of the disease in female patients, the maximum load of the foot support (bearing) surface when standing and walking was reduced. Limb muscle strength in female patients is twice lower than that in male patients. As far as the disease progressed, more rapid decrease in the contractility of <b>femoral</b> <b>muscles</b> was noted compared to that of the leg. The compensatory increase in muscle strength of the leg was observed for Stage 1 of the disease and after the performed complex conservative treatment. Walking speed in the patients decreased with their age increasing, and the pulse value of locomotion increased with the disease stage increasing. Conclusion. More frequent involvement of the hip in women may be partially explained by the increase in the relative number of the gender representatives in the older age groups. Hypertension in female patients with coxarthrosis is a compensatory response related to microcirculation aggravation in limb tissues, the dynamometric parameters of <b>femoral</b> <b>muscles</b> in female patients are much lower, and the load of foot support surface is less...|$|E

There are some evidences that some drugs (natural or synthetic) can modify the bioavailability of. radiopharmaceutical. If unknown, the drug interaction with radiopharmaceuticals can lead to misdiagnosis or the necessity to repeat the examination, increasing the dose to the patient. The morphine is the main analgesic drug of the group of the opium and it has been used extensively in the medical field to treat severe pain, mainly those provoked by cancer. Many patients suffering of oncologic pain utilize the morphine as anthialgic therapy and need to submit themselves to complementary exams like bone scintigraphy which utilizes the methylenediphosphonic acid(MDP) labeled with 99 m Technetium (99 mTc-MDP) to evaluate the presence of metastasis. To evaluate the effects of the morphine on the biodistribution of 99 mTc-MDP in male Wistar rats, morphine (30 mg/Kg/day) was administered in male Wistar rats (n= 6; age= 3 months old),orally, during 7 days. One hour after the last dose, were injected 0, 1 ml of 99 Tc-MDP(100 ?Ci), via ophthalmic plexus. The control group (n= 6) received only physiologic solution, instead of morphine, in the same conditions. The animals were rapidly sacrificed in 2 different periods: one group in 60 minutes (n= 6) and the other group in a 120 minutes (n= 6) after administration the 99 mTc-MDP.

The distribution of larvae in muscles of naturally infected Nile crocodiles and experimentally infected caimans (Caiman crocodilus) and varans (Varanus exanthematicus) have been reported in literature. To determine the distribution patterns of T. zimbabwensis larvae and predilection muscles, 15 crocodiles were randomly divided into three cohorts of five animals each, representing high infection (642 larvae/kg of bodyweight average), medium infection (414 larvae/kg of bodyweight average) and low infection (134 larvae/kg of bodyweight average) cohorts. In the high infection cohort, high percentages of larvae were observed in the triceps muscles (26 %) and hind limb muscles (13 %). In the medium infection cohort, high percentages of larvae were found in the triceps muscles (50 %), sternomastoid (18 %) and hind limb muscles (13 %). In the low infection cohort, larvae were mainly found in the intercostal muscles (36 %), longissimus complex (27 %), forelimb muscles (20 %) and hind limb muscles (10 %). Predilection muscles in the high and medium infection cohorts were similar to those reported in naturally infected crocodiles despite changes in infection intensity. The high infection cohort had significantly higher numbers of larvae in the sternomastoid, triceps, intercostal, longissimus complex, external tibial flexor, longissimus caudalis and caudal <b>femoral</b> <b>muscles</b> (p < 0. 05) compared with the medium infection cohort. In comparison with the low infection cohort, the high infection cohort harboured significantly higher numbers of larvae in all muscles (p < 0. 05) except for the tongue.

Results from this study show that, in Nile crocodiles, larvae of T. zimbabwensis appear first to invade predilection muscles closest to their release site in the small intestine before occupying those muscles situated further away. The recommendation for the use of masseter, pterygoid and intercostal muscles as sampling sites for the detection of T. zimbabwensis in crocodiles is in contrast to the results from this study, where the fore- and hind limb muscles had the highest number of larvae.

M. rectus femoris was completely recovered in greater number of patients (54. 1 %), comparing to m. vastus intermedius (25. 4 %). We conclude that the ultrasound is an appropriate method for monitoring the process of muscular atrophy during immobilization, {{as well as the}} course of muscular restitution during the physical therap...|$|E

The main focus was on the protective pattern of femoral 111 uscles activity in knees with insufficient stability, due to ACL les ion. The study was based on theory as well as previous investigations of "the ha 111 string reflex". 16 patients with ACL lesion (6 men and 1 O women; mean age = 34 years, range = fro 111 15 to 54) divided in 2 groups (with and without ACL reconstruction) participated in this study. The EMG activity of assessed <b>femoral</b> <b>muscles</b> was analysed during 3 specific activities: calm standing (CS), rythmic weight bearing (RWB), forward lunge (FL). The performance of PA were standardized by the use of the forceplate offered by NeuroCom® "Balance [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A disease {{characterized}} by tongue and facial muscle atrophy {{has been recognized}} sporadically among Pembroke Welsh Corgi (PWC) dogs in Japan. The present study describes the pathologic findings of this canine syndrome. Histopathologic examinations were performed in 2 dogs, including a case of muscular biopsy. Identification and characterization of autoantibodies were attempted by fluorescent antibody test (FAT) and Western blot (WB) by using sera from 7 PWC dogs with typical clinical features, 6 PWC dogs with other clinical signs, and 2 from other breeds with polymyositis. Clinically, the 7 affected PWC dogs exhibited dysphagia with severe tongue atrophy, facial muscular atrophy, and occasional walking difficulty. Histopathologic examinations of the 2 dogs with clinical symptoms revealed moderate to severe inflammatory lesions {{characterized by}} lymphohistiocytic infiltration and muscular atrophy in the tongue and/or <b>femoral</b> <b>muscles.</b> The tongue lesions were very severe and accompanied by diffuse fatty infiltration. There were no major lesions in the nervous tissues examined. By FAT, an autoantibody against the cross striation of skeletal muscle was detected in sera from 5 affected PWC dogs. By using WB analysis, the autoantibodies recognized a 42 -kDa molecule in striated muscle {{but not in the}} nervous tissues. All of the findings indicated that the unique disease of PWC dogs might be generalized inflammatory myopathy, whereas the detailed etiology concerning the dominant involvement of tongue muscles {{and the role of the}} autoantibody in the canine disease remain to be clarified...|$|E

After a specific period, the implants were retrieved along with the tissue and examined under scanning electron microscope to observe the new soft and hard tissue growth around the implant via bioactive coating. From the SEM study it was observed that the attachment and regeneration of soft and hard tissue on the coated surface of composite strip was perfectly normal...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the work}} is to find out peculiarities in manifestation of {{oxidative}} stress and to determine activity of enzymes, responsible for utilization of endogenous aldehydes in the mitochondrial fraction of the skeletal (<b>femoral)</b> <b>muscle</b> in pubertal rats during immobilization stress. Our study has shown that differently directed changes in the activity of mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenases and aldehyde reductases occur in the pubertal immobilized rats, that limits the catabolism effectiveness as regards carbonyl products of free radical oxidation in the muscle cells. Corroboration of the effect under consideration is an increased level of protein free radical oxidation products in the mitochondria of the skeletal muscle. On the basis of the obtained data the authors draw a conclusion about an increased sensitivity of the skeletal muscle to the oxidative stress impact due to modulation in the state of enzyme system, responsible for utilization of endogenous aldehydes in the mitochondria...|$|R
40|$|The {{present report}} {{describes}} a rare case of spontaneous primary histiocytic sarcoma of the {{popliteal lymph node}} in a 19 -week-old female Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat. At necropsy, a 10 mm-diameter whitish nodule was found {{at the site of}} the <b>femoral</b> <b>muscle</b> in the right hindlimb. Histopathologically, the nodule comprised large pleomorphic histiocyte-like cells with abundant eosinophilic or foamy cytoplasm. Multinucleated giant cells, necrotic foci surrounded by palisading arrays of epithelioid histiocyte-like cells and phagocytosis of cell debris or erythrocytes by the neoplastic cells were occasionally observed. Invasion of the tumor cells into the surrounding adipose tissue was found focally, but there were no distal metastases. Immunohistochemically, the neoplastic cells were positive for vimentin, CD 68 (ED 1) and lysozyme. We concluded that this tumor occurred in the popliteal lymph node, considering the anatomical location of the lesion and the presence of the remnants of lymphoid tissue involved in the tumor...|$|R
