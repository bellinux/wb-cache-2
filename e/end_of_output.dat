Some notable periods, {{which resulted in}} a necessity to implement extensive stabilisation measures, are March 1995 in Hungary, May 1997 in the Czech Republic, and September 1998 in the Slovak Republic. This paper shows that the standard early warning indicators provided useful information on macroeconomic vulnerability prior to the crises in central Europe, although this information had been mainly indicative; that is, early warning indicators would not have allowed one to predict the crises and their timing. In particular, the growing gap between current account deficit and foreign direct investment (FDI) in all the analysed countries provided clear early warning of subsequent economic turbulence.

However, we find that the best piecewise-linear-threshold contract is significantly superior to the best linear contract when the agent has a power utility function.
