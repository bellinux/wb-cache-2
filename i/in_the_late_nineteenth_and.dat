5|$|Forte Tre Sassi (or Forte Tra i Sassi) is a {{fortress}} constructed in 1897 during the Austro-Hungarian period on the Passo Valparola. It lies between Sass de Stria and Piccolo Lagazuoi, dominating the passage between the Passo Falzarego and Val Badia in South Tyrol (Alto Adige). It {{was part of}} the large complex of Austrian fortifications built on the Italian border <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> early twentieth century.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the first}} {{description}} of a Dimetrodon fossil came a year earlier, when Cope named the species Clepsydrops limbatus from the Texas Red Beds. (The name Clepsydrops was first coined by Cope in 1875 for sphenacodontid remains from Vermilion County, Illinois, and was later employed for many sphenacontid specimens from Texas; many new species of sphenacodontids from Texas were assigned to either Clepsydrops or Dimetrodon <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> early twentieth centuries.) C.limbatus was reclassified as a species of Dimetrodon in 1940, meaning that Cope's 1877 paper was the first record of Dimetrodon.|$|E
5|$|Originally the Frome {{joined the}} Avon {{downstream}} of Bristol Bridge, and formed {{part of the}} city defences, but in the thirteenth century the river was diverted through marshland belonging to St Augustine's Abbey (now Bristol Cathedral), as part of major port improvement works. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> early twentieth centuries, the lower reaches of the river were culverted and the river now flows under The Centre into St Augustine's Reach.|$|E

5|$|The tail of Dimetrodon {{makes up}} {{a large portion of}} its total body length and {{includes}} around 50 caudal vertebrae. Tails were missing or incomplete in the first described skeletons of Dimetrodon; the only caudal vertebrae known were the eleven closest to the hip. Since these first few caudal vertebrae narrow rapidly as they progress farther from the hip, many paleontologists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> early twentieth centuries thought that Dimetrodon had a very short tail. It was not until 1927 that a largely complete tail of Dimetrodon was described.|$|E
5|$|An {{area the}} Reform Act {{did not address}} was the issue of {{municipal}} and regional government. As a result of archaic traditions, many English counties had enclaves and exclaves, which were mostly abolished in the Counties (Detached Parts) Act 1844. Furthermore, many new conurbations and economic areas bridged traditional county boundaries by having been formed in previously obscure areas: the West Midlands conurbation bridged Staffordshire, Warwickshire and Worcestershire, Manchester and Liverpool both had hinterlands in Cheshire but city centres in Lancashire, while in the south Oxford's developing southern suburbs were in Berkshire and London was expanding into Essex, Surrey and Middlesex. This led to further acts to reorganise county boundaries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> twentieth centuries.|$|E

25|$|What {{is today}} broadly called Afrocentrism evolved {{out of the}} work of African-American intellectuals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> early twentieth centuries, but flowered into its modern form due to the {{activism}} of African-American intellectuals in the U.S. Civil Rights Movement and in the development of African-American Studies programs in universities. In strict terms Afrocentrism, as a distinct academic ideology, reached its peak in the 1980s and 1990s. Today it is primarily associated with Molefi Asante.|$|E
25|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth,</b> <b>and</b> {{first half}} of the twentieth century, doctors were taught that babies did not {{experience}} pain, and were treating their young patients accordingly. From needle sticks to tonsillectomies to heart operations were done with no anaesthesia or analgesia, other than muscle relaxation for the surgery. The belief was that in babies the expression of pain was reflexive and, owing to the immaturity of the infant brain, the pain could not really matter.|$|E

25|$|The Baconian theory gained great {{popularity}} and attention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>late</b> <b>nineteenth</b> <b>and</b> early twentieth century, although since {{the mid-twentieth century}} the primacy of his candidacy as author of the Shakespeare canon has been supplanted by that of Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford.

25|$|It was {{not until}} 1941, when President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an {{executive}} order forbidding discrimination in employment by a company working under a government defense contract, that economic discrimination took on the overtones it has today, which is discrimination against minorities.
