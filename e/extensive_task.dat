The archbishop also encouraged devotion to the Sacred Heart of Jesus and urged priests to implement Eucharistic Adoration in their parishes. He also organized courses for the priests wanting to be prepared for social work among the poor and financed several Catholic societies. His support for the students made him a popular figure even to other denominations. In 1904 he organized the first Mariological Congress in Poland.|$|E

This is often combined with business rules {{to make the system}} more intelligent {{so that it can be}} utilized in running various analysis on the data. E.g. a gas pipeline GIS system can let the users perform detailed analysis of all the pressure points or valves located on the pipe at different intervals. This can be possible by defining a relationship between a pipeline entity or object and the pressure valve object. Designing a data model for any utility company could be an <b>extensive</b> <b>task</b> which involves requirements gathering and analysis, designing specifications and implementation. Implementation mostly deals with development of functional tools to assist users in managing and analyzing the system.

An advanced AM/FM/GIS software is always equipped with pre-defined functions and procedures to carry out common GIS operations.|$|E

40|$|Following the {{distinction}} between intensive and extensive reading, we introduce the <b>extensive</b> written <b>tasks</b> to promote the following learning objectives: 1) bringing writing closer to the learner’s personal life; 2) practicing the epistemic and communicative language functions; 3) giving the learner full responsibility for the creative act; 4) facilitating the development of cognitive processes, and 5) developing habits of written production {{in a variety of}} situations. As a consequence, extensive writing assignments produce longer texts, last longer, are self-directed by the learner-author, treat interdisciplinary topics and are not in the textbook. These tasks markedly differ from the more frequent written exercises in the classroom, which are teacher-led, contain shorter texts, work on executive or instrumental functions, and their correction is focused on spelling and grammar. We propose several educational tools in order to develop this type of tasks: portfolios (to save drafts, corrections and final versions of each text), formats (such as reading logs, lecture notes and laboratory protocols) and contexts (common communicative tasks). We also discuss some basic parameters of <b>extensive</b> <b>tasks,</b> such as the length of the text, the use of several working sessions for text production, the practice of composition processes and the use of peer review, in pairs or teams. </p...|$|R

Many of these applica-tions involve complex {{processing}} tasks {{that are difficult to}} run on resource constrained mobile devices. This leads to the emergence of mobile cloud computing, in which cloud-based resources are used to enhance the computing capabilities of mobile devices. In this paper, we consider heterogeneous wireless networks in which multiple resource-rich computing nodes can be used as mobile clouds, and mobile devices can upload computation <b>extensive</b> <b>tasks</b> to these mobile clouds. The goal is to minimize the average task response time through determining whether to upload a task, and to which cloud the task should be uploaded.

For tasks such as grasping, there are no reliable success measures available. Defining reward functions by hand requires <b>extensive</b> <b>task</b> knowl-edge and often leads to undesired emergent behavior. Instead, we propose to learn the reward function through active learning, querying human expert knowledge for a subset of the agent’s rollouts. We introduce a framework, wherein a traditional learn-ing algorithm interplays with the reward learning component, such that the evolution of the action learner guides the queries of the reward learner. We demonstrate results of our method on a robot grasping task and show that the learned reward function generalizes to a similar task. I...|$|E

Then we introduce well-known measures of parallel cooperation performance. Finally, we discuss the main issues of introducing parallel computing methods in business process management. Besides the costs of parallel redesign and of redefinition of responsibilities, the parallel engineering would impose strict requirements on collective work capabilities, training and discipline. Efficient communication system and clear andunambiguous protocol of communication are also necessary.

A steel structure serves as an example of use for this method. The advantages of the covariance method will be demonstrated for the case of a stochastic structural optimization. In this context, a multi-step solution is proposed which uses different methods with increasing accuracy both for the optimization and the computation of the reliability. ...|$|E
