5|$|The strong odor {{associated}} with marsh shrews (in common with other long-tailed shrews) {{may be a}} means of communication. Similar to other shrews, they have poor eyesight. If a marsh shrew is placed in a <b>foreign</b> <b>environment</b> (such as along an edge of a raised surface), it will run off the edge and continue to run after landing on the surface below. Landing in water, it dives beneath the surface. Marsh shrews are easily trapped in sunken cans, possibly due to their inability {{to see where the}} edges of surfaces drop. In captivity they vocalize when they are displaced or scuffle with other animals in their cage, twittering shrilly if disturbed while eating or in a confrontation over food (such as a worm). Although it is uncertain whether marsh shrews cache (or hoard) food in the wild, in captivity they set aside nightcrawlers {{in a corner of the}} cage for later consumption; no other food items were set aside in this fashion.|$|E

500|$|The film's {{score was}} {{performed}} by the London Symphony Orchestra with Belgian composer Dirk Brossé conducting. It was recorded in the United Kingdom at the Watford Coloseum and the London AIR Lyndhurst Hall and was mixed at the Manhattan Center Studios in the United States. In the liner notes to the album, Goldenthal describes the soundtrack as combining [...] "orchestration techniques associated with the late 20th-century Polish avant-garde, {{as well as my}} own experiments from Alien 3, and 19th-century Straussian brass and string instrumentation." [...] In the film's 'Making of' featurette, Goldenthal states he used [...] "ghostly choral" [...] music when the Phantoms are emerging, in an attempt to give a celestial feeling, and focused on low brass clusters and taiko drum rhythms for violent scenes. When Aki talks about a dying girl, Goldenthal used a piano in order to give a domestic home-like feeling to a completely <b>foreign</b> <b>environment,</b> also choosing to use a flute each time Aki focusses on Gaia, as he believed it to be the most [...] "human kind of instrument".|$|E
500|$|Art {{historian}} and curator Ugochukwu-Smooth Nzewi described Ogboh's work as capturing [...] "the maddening hyper-visuality of Lagos". Ogboh was among Nzewi's most anticipated artists at the 2014 contemporary African art festival [...] In 2013, Ogboh reported reception of his Lagos Soundscapes as mixed: annoying some and intriguing others. Quiet European cities {{have considered the}} work [...] "noisy and obtrusive", in one case destroying a speaker and calling the police on the installation. The artist appreciated the installation's effect on Nigerians abroad, and how being in earshot of the soundscape confused them in their <b>foreign</b> <b>environment.</b> Art historian Carol Magee noted how even {{in the business of}} the Lagos Soundscapes, she felt a stillness in which her attention was focused and the patterns unchanging despite the cacophony of the scene. Malawian visual artist Massa Lemu described Ogboh's work as embodying Afropolitanism, in which African cities were representative of a busy, globalized world and its multiple cultures centralized in one place. Lemu thought of Ogboh's soundscapes as [...] "auditory landscapes" [...] that recreate a sense of the Lagos environment. He additionally compared Ogboh's practice with that of sound artists James Webb (South Africa) and Magdi Mostafa (Egypt), though these two tend to manipulate their recordings where Ogboh instead recontextualizes the original. For this reason, Lemu considered Ogboh's work to be closer in lineage to John Cage's recontextualized found sounds than the practice of El Anatsui or Romuald Hazoume recycling found objects as commentary on economic conditions.|$|E

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 90 - 91) The {{ever increasing}} number of organizations with international operations, {{and the necessity of}} accumulating financial information about the entire business controlled and operated?? by this type of enterprise, introduces a unique problem: translation of financial statements of foreign subsidiaries. The problem of translation is magnified by the diversity of accounting standards and methods currently in use throughout the world. The Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), currently the most authoritative rule-making body of the accounting profession in the United States, issued Statement No. 8 in an attempt to set accounting standards for foreign currency translation. The investors in multinational organizations need a more realistic representation of foreign earnings capacity than that provided by the temporal method of accounting for foreign currency translation proposed by the FASB. The temporal method presents a serious problem for investors in that it ignores the financial relationships as they exist in <b>foreign</b> <b>environments.</b> The primary objective and the purpose of this thesis is to search for, investigate, and develop a useful method of translation of foreign currency financial statements for use by investors and to illustrate the application of this method. The proposed method, while not an absolute or perfect translation method under all circumstances, is the most theoretically sound of the currently available methods for use by investors because it recognizes and maintains the financial relationships as they exist in <b>foreign</b> <b>environments.</b> (See more in text. ...|$|R
