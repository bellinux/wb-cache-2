40|$|This {{paper is}} {{a report on the}} state of the art of light {{dosimetry}} in photomedicine and photobiology. The basic quantity of interest is the radiant <b>energy</b> <b>fluence</b> rate, which can either be measured using a suitable probe, or calculated theoretically from measured optical constants. First, theoretical models used to analyse experimental transmission and reflection data are briefly discussed. It is shown that a two-flux model derived from the transport equation in the diffusion approximation resembles the Kubelka-Munk and other heuristic models. This illustrates the limitations of these models and suggests their abandonment in favour of transport theory. For theoretical <b>energy</b> <b>fluence</b> rate calculations at least three optical constants are needed, namely the absorption coefficient, the scattering coefficient and the average cosine of the scattering angle. These three constants have been measured for very few tissues. In principle only two of the three constants can be measured directly on thin samples, independent of a theoretical model. The <b>energy</b> <b>fluence</b> rate can be measured quantitatively with a miniature fibre optic probe with isotropic response. Such measurements allow indirect determination of the three optical constants. It appears that we are just beginning to understand the distribution of light <b>energy</b> <b>fluence</b> rate in tissues. Tasks for the near future are comparison of methods to measure optical constants, quantitative checks of calculated and measured <b>energy</b> <b>fluence</b> rates in model tissues and optical phantoms and further development of theoretical models.

Cultures of Prevotella intermedia and P. nigrescens were killed by 4. 2 J/cm 2, whereas P. melaninogenica required 21 J/cm 2. Exposure to light with a fluence of 42 J/cm 2 produced 99 % killing of P. gingivalis.

Output factors calculated with the convolution method as the dose per unit <b>energy</b> <b>fluence</b> relative to the calculated dose per unit <b>energy</b> <b>fluence</b> in a reference field could deviate as much as 5 % if corrections are not made for perturbations due to treatment head scatter.

40|$|In typical {{treatment}} {{planning of}} 3 D IMRT, the incident <b>energy</b> <b>fluence</b> is optimized {{to achieve a}} homogeneous dose distribution to the PTV. The PTV includes the tumour but also healthy tissues that may have a different dose response for the same incident <b>energy</b> <b>fluence,</b> like bony structures included in the PTV (mandibles in head and neck tumours or femoral bones in sarcomas). Dose to medium optimization compensates for this heterogeneous response, leading to a non-homogeneous <b>energy</b> <b>fluence</b> in the PTV and a non-homogeneous dose in the CTV {{in the presence of}} geometric errors. We illustrate qualitatively this statement in a cylindrical geometry where the PTV includes a CTV (7 cm diameter) made of water surrounded by ICRU compact bone (1. 2 cm thickness); such configuration was chosen to exaggerate the aforementioned effect. Optimization was performed assuming dose equals photon <b>energy</b> <b>fluence</b> times mass energy absorption coefficient. Bone has a 4 % lower dose response in a 6 MV flattening filter free spectrum. After optimization either in medium or assuming everything as water composition, the geometry was shifted by 1. 2 cm and dose recomputed. As expected, compensating for the under-response of the bone material during optimization in medium leads to an overdosage of the CTV when patient geometric errors are taken into account. Optimization in dose assuming everything as water composition leads to a uniform coverage. Robust optimization or forcing a uniform atomic composition in the PTV margin may resolve this incompatibility between the PTV concept and dose to medium optimization. status: publishe...|$|E

The scaling reveals an approximately linear {{dependence of the}} peak ELM energy with the pedestal top electron pressure and with the minor radius; a square root dependence is seen on the relative ELM loss energy. The result of this scaling gives a range in parallel peak ELM <b>energy</b> <b>fluence</b> of 10 – 30 MJm− 2 for ITER Q=[*] 10 operation and 2. 5 – 7. 5 MJm− 2 for intermediate ITER operation at 7. 5 MA and 2. 65 T.

40|$|In this work, an {{amorphous}} silicon electronic portal imaging device (a-Si EPID) dose prediction model {{based on the}} <b>energy</b> <b>fluence</b> model of the Pinnacle treatment planning system Version 7 (Philips Medical Systems, Madison, WI) is developed. An <b>energy</b> <b>fluence</b> matrix at very high resolution (< 1 mm) is used to incorporate multileaf collimator (MLC) leaf effects in the predicted EPID images. The primary dose deposited in the EPID is calculated from the <b>energy</b> <b>fluence</b> using experimentally derived radially dependent EPID interaction coefficients. Separate coefficients are used for the open beam <b>energy</b> <b>fluence</b> component and the component of the <b>energy</b> <b>fluence</b> transmitted through closed MLC leaves to each EPID pixel. A spatially invariant EPID dose deposition kernel that describes both radiative dose deposition, central axis EPID backscatter, and optical glare is convolved with the primary dose. The kernel is further optimized to give accurate EPID penumbra prediction and EPID scatter factor with changing MLC field size. An EPID calibration method was developed to reduce the effect of nonuniform backscatter from the support arm (E-arm) in a calibrated EPID image. This method removes the backscatter component from the pixel sensitivity (flood field) correction matrix retaining only field-specific backscatter in the images. The model was compared to EPID images for jaw and MLC defined open fields and eight head and neck intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) fields. For {{the head and neck}} IMRT fields with 2 %, 2 mm criteria 97. 6 ± 0. 6 % (mean ± 1 standard deviation) of points passed with a gamma index less than 1, and for 3 %, 3 mm 99. 4 ± 0. 4 % of points were within the criteria. For these fields, the 2 %, 2 mm pass score reduced to 96. 0 ± 1. 5 % when backscatter was present in the pixel sensitivity correction matrix.

It {{was found that}} the <b>energy</b> <b>fluence</b> scaling law breaks down for laser pulses shorter than ∼ 100 ps for C 3 F 7 I. This is consistent with similar results obtained previously for SF 6 and C 2 F 5 Cl. The reason for the increased intensity dependence is physically due to an increase in the intrinsic small signal absorption cross section of the polyatomic molecules for short interaction times. This increase in the absorption coefficient is not intensity related and is a fundamental property of a dense ensemble of interacting states. The change in the absorption cross section for all molecules studied reveals a nonequilibration of energy relaxation among all the states even for 100 ps pulses.

Our aim in this work is to investigate the sensitivity of the photon-beam subsource distributions in a MC source model (with target, primary collimator, and flattening filter photon subsources and an electron subsource) for 6 - and 18 -MV photon beams when the energy and radial distributions of initial electrons striking a linac target change. For this purpose, phase-space data (PSD) was calculated for various mean electron energies striking the target, various normally distributed electron energy spread, and various normally distributed electron radial intensity distributions. All PSD was analyzed in terms of <b>energy,</b> <b>fluence,</b> and <b>energy</b> <b>fluence</b> distributions, which were compared between the different parameter sets.
