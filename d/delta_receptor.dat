40|$|Down-regulation of opiate receptors is {{demonstrated}} more easily in vitro than in vivo. The possible role of endogenous opiate-modulating peptides in preventing such down-regula-tion was investigated by addition of Tyr-W-MIF- 1 to an in vitro preparation, the human neuroblastoma cell line SH-SY 5 Y, in which down-regulation of opiate receptors has been demon-strated previously. Although both morphine and Met-enkepha-lin down-regulated mu and <b>delta</b> <b>receptors</b> after chronic (24 h) exposure in serum-free medium, Tyr-W-MIF- 1, at doses {{of up to}} 100 mM, did not affect receptor number when administered alone. This lack of effect could not be attributed to degradation of the peptide during chronic treatment because high-perfor-mance liquid chromatography showed that 79 % of the peptide remained intact after a 24 -h incubation. When coadministered with 3 mM morphine, Tyr-W-MIF- 1 dose-dependently attenu-ated morphine-induced down-regulation of both mu and <b>delta</b> <b>receptors.</b> Down-regulation of mu receptors by the selective agonist PL 017 was also attenuated by Tyr-W-MIF- 1, but down-regulation of <b>delta</b> <b>receptors</b> by the selective agonist DPDPE was not. These studies indicate that endogenous opiate mod-ulators {{may play a role}} in opiate tolerance at the level of receptor down-regulation.

N-Alkylation of H-Dmt-Tic-OH and H-Dmt-Tic-Ala-OH with methyl groups produced potent delta-opioid ligands with high <b>delta</b> <b>receptor</b> binding capabilities and enhanced delta antagonism: (i) N-Me-Dmt-Tic-OH 5 had high delta opioid binding (Ki delta = 0. 2 nM), elevated delta antagonism on mouse vas deferens (MVD) (pA 2 = 8. 5; Ke = 2. 8 nM), and nondetectable mu activity with guinea pig ileum (GPI).

We have constructed delta/mu opioid receptor chimeras that were express in human embryonic kidney 293 cells in order to define receptor domains that are responsible for receptor type selectivity. All chimeric receptors and wild-type delta and mu opioid receptors displayed high-affinity binding of etorphine (an agonist), naloxone (an antagonist), and bremazocine (a mixed agonist/antagonist). In contrast, chimeras that lacked the putative first extracellular loop of the mu receptor did not bind the mu-selective peptide [D-Ala 2,MePhe 4,Gly 5 -ol]enkephalin (DAMGO).

DPDPE and deltorphin II are considered prototypes, but their delta-selectivity in vivo and the true ability of <b>delta</b> <b>receptors</b> to produce analgesia remain to be demonstrated. Here we have performed a parallel analysis of mu, delta and combinatorial opioid receptor knockout mice, in which we found no obvious alteration of G-protein coupling for remaining opioid receptors. We compared behavioural responses in two models of acute thermal pain following DPDPE and deltorphin II administration by intracerebroventricular route. In the tail-immersion test, both compounds were fully analgesic in delta knockout mice and totally inactive in mu knockout mice. In the hotplate test, the two compounds again produced full analgesia in delta knockout mice. In mu knockout mice, there was significant, although much lower, analgesia. Furthermore, DPDPE analgesia in the delta knockout mice was fully reversed by the mu selective antagonist CTOP in both tests. Together, this suggests that mu rather than <b>delta</b> <b>receptors</b> are recruited by the two agonists for the tail withdrawal and the hotplate responses. Finally, deltorphin II slightly prolonged jump latencies in double mu/kappa knockout mice (<b>delta</b> <b>receptors</b> only) and this response was abolished in the triple knockout mice, demonstrating that the activation of <b>delta</b> <b>receptors</b> alone can produce weak but significant mu-independent thermal antinociception.

The effect of DADLE (1 microM) was blocked by the mu-antagonist D-Phe-Cys-Tyr-D-Trp-Arg-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH 2 (CTAP; 300 nM) but not by the -antagonist Tyr- 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrahydroisoquinoline-Phe-Phe-OH (300 nM), implicating mu receptors. Despite a lack of functional delta receptors, flow cytometry revealed cell-surface receptors. We used this approach to identify conditions that up-regulate receptors, including mu receptor gene deletion in dorsal root ganglion neurons of mu-/- mice and 18 -h incubation of mu+/+ neurons with CTAP followed by brief (10 -min) DPDPE exposure. Under these conditions, the expression of cell-surface delta receptors was up-regulated to 149 +/- 9 and 139 +/- 5 %, respectively; furthermore, DPDPE and deltorphin II (1 microM) inhibited Ca 2 + currents in both cases. Viral replacement of mu receptors in mu-/- neurons reduced <b>delta</b> <b>receptor</b> expression to mu+/+ levels, restored the inhibition of Ca 2 + currents by DAMGO, and abolished receptor coupling. Our observations suggest that receptor-Ca 2 + channel coupling in primary afferent fibers may have little functional significance under basal conditions in which mu receptors predominate.

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Opioid receptors {{regulate}} {{a diverse}} array of physiological functions. Mu opioid receptor agonists are well-known analgesics for treating acute pain. In contrast, animal models suggest that chronic pain is more effectively relieved by <b>delta</b> opioid <b>receptor</b> agonists. A {{number of studies have}} shown that chronic pain results in increased function of <b>delta</b> opioid <b>receptors.</b> This is proposed to result from enhanced trafficking of the <b>delta</b> opioid <b>receptor</b> to the cell membrane induced by persistent tissue injury. However, recent studies have questioned this mechanism, which has resulted in some uncertainty as to whether <b>delta</b> opioid <b>receptors</b> are indeed upregulated in chronic pain states. To clarify this question, we have examined the effect of chronic inflammatory pain over time using both an ex vivo measure of delta function: receptor-Ca 2 + channel coupling, and an in vivo measure; the relief of chronic pain by a <b>delta</b> opioid <b>receptor</b> agonist. In addition, as beta-arrestin 2 can regulate <b>delta</b> opioid <b>receptor</b> trafficking and signaling, we have further examined whether deleting this scaffolding and signal transduction molecule alters <b>delta</b> opioid <b>receptor</b> function. 				 				 					 						Results 					We used the Complete Freund&# 8217;s Adjuvant model of inflammatory pain, and examined the effectiveness of the delta agonist, SNC 80, to both inhibit Ca 2 + channels in primary afferent neurons and to attenuate mechanical allodynia. In na&# 239;ve beta-arrestin 2 wildtype and knockout mice, SNC 80 neither significantly inhibited voltage-dependent Ca 2 + currents nor produced antinociception. However, following inflammatory pain, both measures showed a significant and long-lasting enhancement of <b>delta</b> opioid <b>receptor</b> function that persisted for up to 14 &# 160;days post-injury regardless of genotype. Furthermore, although this pain model did not alter Ca 2 + current density, the contribution of N-type Ca 2 + channels to the total current appeared to be regulated by the presence of beta-arrestin 2. 				 				 					 						Conclusions 					Our results indicate that there is an upregulation of <b>delta</b> opioid <b>receptor</b> function following chronic pain. This gain of function is reflected in the increased efficacy of a delta agonist in both behavioral and electrophysiological measures.

40|$|Background: GPCRs {{regulate}} {{a remarkable}} diversity of biological functions, {{and are thus}} often targeted for drug therapies. Stimulation of a GPCR by an extracellular ligand triggers receptor signaling via G proteins, and this process is highly regulated. Receptor activation is typically accompanied by desensitization of receptor signaling, a complex feedback regulatory process of which receptor internalization is postulated as a key event. The in vivo significance of GPCR internalization is poorly understood. In fact, the majority of studies have been performed in transfected cell systems, which do not adequately model physiological environments and the complexity of integrated responses observed in the whole animal. Methods and Findings: In this study, we used knock-in mice expressing functional fluorescent delta opioid receptors (DOReGFP) {{in place of the}} native receptor to correlate receptor localization in neurons with behavioral responses.

This work opened the door for rapid advances in this area. Several groups, including the authors, subsequently cloned the remaining two major types of opioid receptors from variou...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} gain insight into a {{possible}} modulatory role for mu, delta, and kappa opioid receptors of the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway, we investigated the topographical organization of the receptors with respect to pre- and postsynaptic membranes. Dopaminergic terminals projecting from the substantia nigra to the corpus striatum were destroyed by unilateral injection of 6 -hydroxydopamine into the substantia nigra. Quantitative receptor assays using highly specific radioligands were {{used to measure the}} density of striatal mu, <b>delta,</b> and kappa <b>receptors</b> before and after denervation. Denervation caused a 34 +/- 2 % loss of striatal mu receptors and a 32 +/- 1 % loss of striatal <b>delta</b> <b>receptors</b> on the lesioned side of the brain; in contrast, kappa receptors did not change significantly in density. Quantitative in vitro autoradiography was used to visualize the neuroanatomical pattern of receptors on lesioned and nonlesioned sides of the brain under the light microscope. Loss of mu receptors in striatal patches was striking in the ventrolateral areas of the striatum, whereas the most notable loss of <b>delta</b> <b>receptors</b> was found in the central striatum. Other brain areas did not differ significantly in mu receptor density between the lesioned and nonlesioned sides, as determined by autoradiography. These findings suggest that a high percentage of mu and <b>delta</b> <b>receptors</b> in the striatum are located on the nigrostriatal dopaminergic terminals and support the concept of a modulatory role for mu and delta opioid peptides in the nigrostriatal dopaminergic pathway...|$|R
40|$|Previously, it {{has been}} {{reported}} that opioid peptides decrease the calcium component of action potentials in a dose-dependent and naloxone-reversible manner consistent with mediation by opiate receptors. To clarify the relation of mu and <b>delta</b> opiate <b>receptors</b> to decreases of somatic calcium-dependent action potential duration, we investigated the potency of two opioid peptides which have different affinities for mu and <b>delta</b> opiate <b>receptors,</b> Leu-enkephalin and morphiceptin. We predicted that Leu-enkephalin would be about 1000 -fold more potent than morphiceptin on dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons if <b>delta</b> <b>receptors</b> mediated decreases of DAG neuron somatic calcium-dependent action potentials, but that these ligands would be approximately equipotent if mu receptors mediated opiate ac-tions. Additionally, because naloxone has been reported to have a higher affinity for mu receptors in comparison with delta recep...|$|R

40|$|Evidence from {{behavioral}} studies {{suggests that}} the process of weaning activates the development of a delta-opioid receptor subtype. We now report the influence of weaning on the development of delta receptors in the central nervous system assessed by membrane homogenate binding and autoradiography with selective delta radioligands and by in situ hybridization using a cRNA probe for the <b>delta</b> <b>receptor.</b> Binding was carried out by using [H- 3][D-Ala(2) ]deltorphin I (DELT I), [H- 3]Ile(5, 6) -deltorphin II (Ile(5, 6) -DELT II) and [H- 3]naltrindole (NTI). [H- 3]Ile(5, 6) -DELT II and [H- 3]NTI labeled an equivalent number of sites in brain and spinal cord from both weaned and nonweaned 25 -day-old rats. The number of sites labeled by [H- 3]DELT I was similar in nonweaned rats but significantly higher in the brain and cord from weaned animals. Furthermore, the ontogenetic profile of these three ligands was distinct. Quantitative autoradiography showed identical levels of [H- 3]Ile(5, 6) -DELT II binding in all brain regions in weaned and nonweaned rats. In contrast, levels of [H- 3]DELT I binding were significantly higher in weaned rats and this difference was localized to the deep layers of the frontal-parietal cortex and to the pontine nucleus. In situ hybridization experiments showed no differences in delta-opioid receptor mRNA density between weaned and nonweaned groups in the regions in which binding differences were observed. Weaning stimulates the development of a subpopulation of delta receptors recognized by [H- 3]DELT I but not by [H- 3]Ile(5, 6) -DELT II or NTI. This effect is localized to specific brain regions and does not appear to reflect increased synthesis of mRNA coding for the <b>delta</b> <b>receptor...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} tri-and tetrapeptides sharing the amino-terminal {{dipeptide}} unit Tyr-Tic, {{found in the}} high-affinity delta opioid receptor antagonist Tyr-Tic-Phe-Phe (TIPP), was prepared and evaluated in receptor binding assays to explore the role(s) of the phenylalanine residues in positions 3 and 4. It was found that aromaticity of residues 3 and 4 is not required for high affinity, a lipophilic side chain in either location being sufficient, {{as evidenced by the}} high <b>delta</b> <b>receptor</b> binding affinities observed for the tetrapeptide Tyr-Tic-Ala-Leu and the tripeptide Tyr-Tic-Leu. These results support the suggestion of Temussi et al. [Biochem. Biophys. Res.

40|$|To {{analyze the}} {{selectivity}} of <b>delta</b> <b>receptor</b> subtypes to regulate different classes of G proteins, {{the expression of}} the α-subunits of Gi 2, Gi 3, Go 1, Go 2, Gq and G 11 transducer proteins was reduced by administration of oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) complementary to sequences in their respective mRNAs. Mice receiving antisense ODNs to G(i 2) α, G(i 3) α, G(o 2) α and G 11 α subunits showed an impaired antinociceptive response to all the delta agonists evaluated. An ODN to G(o 1) α specifically blocked the antinociceptive effect of the agonist of delta- 1 receptors, [D- Pen 2. 5]enkephalin (DPDPE), without altering the activity of [D- Ala 2]deltorphin II or [D-Ser 2]-Leu-enkephalin-Thr (DSLET). In mice treated with an ODN to G(q) α, the effects of the agonists of delta- 2 -opioid receptors were reduced, but not those of DPDPE. Thus, Go 1 proteins are selectively linked to delta- 1 -mediated analgesia, and Gq proteins are related to delta- 2 evoked antinociception. After impairing the synthesis of G(o 1) α subunits, DPDPE exhibited an antagonistic activity on the antinociception produced by [D-Ala 2]deltorphin II. After treatment with ODNs complementary to sequences in G(q) α or PLC-β 1 mRNAs, the analgesic capacity of [D- Ala 2]deltorphin II was diminished. However, the delta- 2 -agonist did not alter the antinociceptive activity of DPDPE. An ODN complementary to nucleotides 7 to 26 of the murine <b>delta</b> <b>receptor</b> reduced the analgesic potency of [D-Ala 2]deltorphin II, but not that observed for DPDPE. In these mice, [D-Ala 2]deltorphin II did not antagonize the effect of DPDPE. These results suggest the existence of different molecular forms of the delta opioid receptor, and the involvement of inositol-signaling pathways in the supraspinal antinociceptive effects of delta agonists.
