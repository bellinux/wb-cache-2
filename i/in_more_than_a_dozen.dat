25|$|When Humphrey {{was less}} than a year old, his father was killed {{fighting}} for the King, Henry IV, against the rebellion of Henry Hotspur, at the Battle of Shrewsbury. Humphrey thus became 6th Earl of Stafford on 21 July 1403. He immediately inherited a large estate with lands <b>in</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> <b>a</b> <b>dozen</b> counties. Before his mother Anne had married Edmund, however, she had previously been married to his older brother, Thomas. As a result, she had accumulated two dowries, each comprising a third of the Stafford estates, and she continued to occupy these lands for the next twenty years. Humphrey, therefore, received a reduced income of less than Â£1,260 a year until he was sixteen. Since his mother could not, by law, be his guardian Humphrey was made a royal ward on his father's death, and was placed under the control of Henry IV's queen, Joan of Navarre. His minority was to be a long one, lasting the next twenty years.|$|E
