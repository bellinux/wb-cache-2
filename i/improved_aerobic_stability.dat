40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of molasses and propionic acid on the fermentation quality and aerobic stability of total mixed ration (TMR) silages prepared with whole-plant corn in Tibet. TMR (354 g/kg DM) was ensiled with four different treatments: no additive (control), molasses (M), propionic acid (P), and molasses+propionic acid (PM), in laboratory silos (250 mL) and fermented for 45 d. Silos were opened and silages were subjected to an aerobic stability test for 12 days, in which chemical and microbiological parameters of TMR silages were measured to determined the aerobic deterioration. After 45 d of ensiling, the four TMR silages were of good quality with low pH value and ammonia/total N (AN), and high lactic acid (LA) content and V-scores. M silage showed the highest (p 10 (5) cfu/g FM), however, it appeared to be more stable as indicated by a delayed pH value increase. P and PM silages showed fewer yeasts (< 10 (5) cfu/g FM) (p< 0. 05) and were more stable than the control and M silages during aerobic exposure. It was concluded that M application increased LA content and <b>improved</b> <b>aerobic</b> <b>stability</b> of TMR silage prepared with whole-plant. corn in Tibet. P application inhibited lactic acid production during ensiling, and apparently preserved available sugars which stimulated large increases in lactic acid during aerobic exposure stage, which resulted in greater aerobic stability of TMR silage...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{assess the}} potency of calcium {{propionate}} (CAP) used as silage additive, an experiment was carried out to evaluate the effect of CAP on the nitrogen transformation, fermentation quality and aerobic stability of alfalfa silages. Methods Alfalfa was ensiled with four levels of CAP (5, 10, 15, and 20 g/kg of fresh weight [FW]) in laboratory silos for 30 days. After opening, the silages were analyzed for the chemical and microbiological characteristics, and subjected to an aerobic stability test. Results The increasing proportion of CAP did not affect pH, lactic acid (LA) concentrations and yeast counts, while linearly decreased counts of enterobacteria (p = 0. 029), molds (p< 0. 001) and clostridia (p< 0. 001), and concentrations of acetic acid (p< 0. 001), propionic acid (p< 0. 001), butyric acid (p< 0. 001), and ethanol (p = 0. 007), and quadratically (p = 0. 001) increased lactic acid bacteria counts. With increasing the proportion of CAP, the dry matter (DM) loss (p< 0. 001), free amino acid N (p< 0. 001), ammonia N (p = 0. 004), and non-protein N (p< 0. 001) contents were linearly reduced, whereas DM (p = 0. 048), water soluble carbohydrate (p< 0. 001) and peptide N (p< 0. 001) contents were linearly increased. The highest Flieg’s point was found in CAP 10 (75. 9), represented the best fermentation quality. All silages treated with CAP <b>improved</b> <b>aerobic</b> <b>stability</b> as indicated by increased stable hours compared with control. Conclusion The addition of CAP can suppress the undesirable microorganisms during ensiling and exposure to air, thereby improving the fermentation quality and aerobic stability as well as retarding the proteolysis of alfalfa silage.

Whole-plant corn was harvested at 80 % milkline (36 % DM), and ensiled at a density of 35 lb of fresh matter/ft 3. Half of the pre-ensiled forage was treated with a biological additive (A) (Sil-All 4 × 4, Alltech, Inc.); the other half of the pre-ensiled forage was the untreated control (C). Half of the silos in the A and C groups were sealed immediately after filling (S=sealed) and the other half of the silos were sealed 48 hours after filling (DS=delayed seal). Treatments consisted of combinations of the two factors: additive (A and C) and sealing technique (S and DS). There were three, 5 -gal capacity, laboratory silos per treatment. Silos were opened after 150 days, and the chemical and microbial compositions and aerobic stability of the silages determined. All four silages were moderately stable during exposure to air. The C, DS silage was the first to show a rise in temperature, which occurred after 65 hours. The two DS silages were 48 hours less stable than their S counterparts, and the two A silages were 24 hours more stable than their C counterparts.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to determine the effects of}} fibrolytic enzymes applied at baling, with or without ferulic acid esterase (FAE) producing bacterial inoculant, or to hay at feeding on digestibility and growth performance of lambs. Prior to starting the animal studies, two runs of replicated 24 - and 48 -h batch culture in vitro incubations were conducted using control alfalfa hay to select a suitable enzyme and dose. Eleven replicate bales of alfalfa-grass (93. 8 : 6. 2) hay (~ 500 kg) were produced with the application of one of three treatments: control (water), enzyme applied at baling (Eb; Econase RDE-L, AB Vista, Wiltshire, UK) and enzyme plus ferulic acid esterase producing bacterial additive applied at baling (EIb; 11 GFT, Pioneer HI-Bred Ltd., Chathan, ON, Canada). The mean internal bale temperature after 50 days of storage was greater (P 0. 05) of treatment on OM intakes. Average daily gain (ADG, g/d) of lambs in the performance study was greater (P= 0. 048) for EIb (233) than control (192) and Ef (202), and intermediate for Eb (206). Feed efficiency tended to be affected (P= 0. 07) by treatment; gain:feed for EIb was 18 % greater than control and Eb and Ef were similar to the control. This study showed that applying enzymes to alfalfa hay at baling decreased aerobic stability, and increased fiber content and its digestibility, but ADG and gain:feed of lambs were not improved.

Furthermore, the possibility to <b>improve</b> <b>aerobic</b> <b>stability</b> of silages by combining an inoculant and chemical preservatives was investigated. Two experiments were conducted with wilted timothy-meadow fescue herbage (dry matter 429 and 344 g kg- 1) using six treatments. In experiment I, E 76 (106 cfu g- 1 fresh matter (FM)) was applied alone and in combination with sodium benzoate (0. 3 g kg- 1 grass FM) or low rate of formic acid (0. 4 l t- 1 FM). In experiment II, E 76 and a commercial inoculant were applied alone and in combination with sodium benzoate. Untreated silage and formic acid (4 l t- 1 FM) treated silage served as negative and positive controls in both experiments.

40|$|Potassium sorbate is {{intended}} {{to be used as a}} technological additive to improve the ensiling process in the range of 90 to 300  mg/kg fresh material. The application of potassium sorbate in the preparation of silage up to the maximum proposed dose of 300  mg/kg forage is safe for the target animals. The additive, when used in silage, is not expected to increase substantially consumer exposure to potassium sorbate. Therefore, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that potassium sorbate, when used as a silage additive, is safe for consumers of food products from animals fed treated silage. Potassium sorbate is a skin and eye irritant and a potential irritant to the respiratory tract. Potassium sorbate is not regarded as a skin sensitiser. The dusting potential of the preparation tested indicates that exposure of users via inhalation is possible. In view of the irritancy of potassium sorbate and the absence of information on its inhalation toxicity, exposure to such dust is considered hazardous. There are no safety concerns for the environment resulting from the use of potassium sorbate as a silage additive. Seven laboratory-scale ensiling studies were reported, each lasting at least 90 days and using forages of different origins. Once silos were opened, <b>aerobic</b> <b>stability</b> was determined. Potassium sorbate has the potential to <b>improve</b> <b>aerobic</b> <b>stability</b> of silage with dry matter content between 21 and 38 % when used at the minimum concentration of 90  mg/kg fresh material...|$|R

40|$|A {{strain of}} Bacillus amyloliquefaciens is {{intended}} to be added to forages to promote the ensiling process (technological additive, functional group: silage additive). The identity of the strain and its susceptibility to relevant antibiotics has been established. However, the strain produces cyclic lipopeptides which possess potent surfactant activity, known to be involved in food intoxication. Although the strain is intended for use only in the production of silage, as a spore former it will survive the ensiling process and be ingested by target animals. The spores will also survive passage through the gastrointestinal tract of animals and be a potential source of contamination of food of animal origin and of the environment. The greatest risk would be to those handling the product on farm following oral, dermal and respiratory exposure. Consequently, the FEEDAP Panel concludes that use of the strain in the production of silage presents a hazard to consumers, users and the environment, and potentially also to the target animals. A total of three laboratory experiments with laboratory-scale silos, each lasting at least 90 days, were carried out using samples of forage of differing dry matter and water-soluble carbohydrate content.

The objectives of this study were {{to determine the effects of}} a propionic acid-based silage additive (Solution Foin) on ensiling characteristics, <b>aerobic</b> <b>stability</b> and feeding value of short-term ensiled corn forage. Chopped whole corn was left untreated or treated with Solution Foin (contains 700 g kg- 1 propionic acid and 300 g kg- 1 NH 4 OH). The additive was added to forage prior ensiling at a rate of 5 L ton- 1 (wet basis). Treated and untreated forages were placed in six plastic silo bags (three each). Silo bags were opened one day after ensiling and daily samples were collected for 30 consecutive days. Effects on animal performance of feeding treated or untreated forage were determined in a completely randomized design, using 30 lactating cows (178 +/- 55 days in milk) fed total mixed ration (50 : 50 forage: concentrate) with the major forage portion consisting of untreated or treated forage. The feeding study started one day post-ensiling. Results showed that Solution Foin reduced (P < 0. 05) yeast and mold populations between d 5 and 14 post-ensiling. The highest differences (P < 0. 002) were observed on d 10, at which point yeast and mold populations for untreated silage were 7. 86 and 2. 51 log cfu g- 1, respectively. The corresponding values for treated silage were 4. 35 and 0. 00 log cfu g- 1, respectively. <b>Aerobic</b> <b>stability</b> of treated ensiled forage was also improved (P < 0. 01) from day 0 (by 159 h) to day 10 (by 33 h) post-ensiling.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Ensiling is a {{conservation}} method for forage crops. It {{is based on}} the fact that anaerobe lactic acid bacteria (LAB) convert water-soluble carbohydrates into organic acids. Therefore, pH decreases and the forage is preserved. The aim of this study was to isolate special kinds of lactic acid bacteria from silage and to study the effect of bacteria, inulin and enzymes as silage additives on the fermentation and <b>aerobic</b> <b>stability</b> of the silage. Materials and Methods: The heterofermentative LAB were isolated from corn silages in Broujerd, Iran and biochemically characterized. Acid tolerance was studied by exposure to acidic PBS and growth in bile salt was measured by the spectrophotometric method. Results: The results of molecular analysis using 16 SrDNA sequences showed that the isolates belonged to Lactobacillus and Enterococcus genera. To enhance stability in acidic environment and against bile salts, microencapsulation with Alginate and Chitosan was used. The Lactobacillus plantarum strains were used as control. The inoculants (1. 107 cfu/g) alone or in combination with inulin or in combination with enzymes were added to chopped forages and ensiled in 1. 5 -L anaerobic jars.

Two strains of LAB (Lactobacillus plantarum: LAB 1, Lactobacillus parafarraqinis: LAB 2) were inoculated for wheat ensiling at 1. 0 × 105 colony forming units per gram of fresh forage. The results indicated that wheat had higher dry matter yields at the milk and dough stages. The highest water-soluble carbohydrates content, crude protein yields and relative feed value of wheat were obtained at the milk stage, while contents of crude fiber, neutral detergent fiber and acid detergent fiber were the lowest, compared to the flowering and dough stages. Lactic acid contents of wheat silage significantly decreased with maturity. Inoculating homofermentative LAB 1 markedly reduced pH values and ammonia-nitrogen (NH 3 -N) content (p< 0. 05) of silages at three maturity stages compared with their corresponding controls. Inoculating heterofermentative LAB 2 did not significantly influence pH values, whereas it notably lowered lactic acid and NH 3 -N content (p< 0. 05) and effectively <b>improved</b> the <b>aerobic</b> <b>stability</b> of silages.

The loss of stability of silages was continuous during the time of aerobic exposure. Inoculants influenced the changes in populations of lactic acid bacteria and yeasts and in the ammoniacal nitrogen, acetic acid and ethanol concentrations.

A linear increase in crude protein content and pH values and decrease in the soluble carbohydrates content were observed. The dry matter contents increased to a maximum of 335 g/kg on fresh matter at four days, followed by reduction after six days. The results showed that the use of inoculants is recommended because it promoted higher production of acetic and propionic acids, reducing the population of yeast and, therefore, <b>improving</b> the <b>aerobic</b> <b>stability</b> of silages...|$|R
40|$|Technology {{innovation}} {{is the process}} through which new technologies are developed. Silage research addresses the various agronomical, biochemical, microbiological, nutritional and engineering aspects of the process. Forage harvesters, additives (inoculants), and plastic films for sealing are important recent developments. The corn silage is {{the major source of}} energy in rations, but recently the use of other ensiled crops, such as sugarcane and legumes, has been increased. Two newer ensiling techniques are the pressed bag and the wrapped bale. Polyethylene film has been the most common method used to protect silage near the surface, but new plastic films are available or in the process of development. A co-extruded polyethylene-polyamide film and new polyvinyl alcohol film also have been used to seal corn silage. Various types of additives have been developed in order to improve the ensiling process. Lactobacillus buchneri, that is an obligate heterolactic acid bacterium, might <b>improve</b> the <b>aerobic</b> <b>stability</b> of silages and have been more effective in corn silage than in other silages. Energy production from silage has also attracted much interest in recent years, as perennial grasses that have been stored as biomass to produce biofuels in the United States, and silage as feedstock for biogas in Europe...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis was to investigate factors to improve the silage quality {{of different types of}} forage crops. The focus was on the influence of crop maturity, silage additives and laceration on the quality of whole-crop cereals silages. The ensilability of whole-crop cereals was highly dependent upon the stage of maturity. An important factor related to the stage of maturity and influencing the ensilability of whole-crop cereals seems to be the concentration of WSC in the fresh forage. Ensiling at the milk stage was found to be a more suitable time to harvest whole-crop cereals since there is a sufficient concentration of water soluble carbohydrates (WSC) that provides the conditions for lactic acid bacteria (LAB) to rapidly dominate the silage microflora and produce enough acids to reduce pH thereby giving a better protection of the silage against the spoilage microflora. The low WSC concentration of whole-crop cereals at dough stage seems to restrain good fermentation. However, silages harvested at the milk stage still appear to have a low <b>aerobic</b> <b>stability.</b> Precision chopping had variable affects on silage fermentation and showed that laceration is not a guarantee of a good silage quality of whole-crop cereals. At the milk stage, precision chopping improved the silage fermentation, whereas the dough-stage silages tended to give clostridial fermentation resulting in poor quality and high DM losses. Precision chopping promoted a higher silage density at the milk stage and resulted in reduced DM losses at the dough stage. Application of silage additives was {{the most important factor in}} improving silage quality. A mixture of sodium benzoate, sodium propionate, hexamine and sodium nitrite seems to be the most suitable additive to secure the silage quality and <b>improve</b> the <b>aerobic</b> <b>stability</b> in whole-crop cereals as well as in moderate and highly -wilted clover-grass forages. No remaining toxic residues of the nitrite concentration were found in the silages. A similar influence on the ensiling process is found when using the combination of sodium benzoate, sodium propionate and propionic acid. The results of mixtures of formic acid and propionic acid were closely related to the chop length of the forage. These additive combinations seem to improve the silage quality and storage stability in precision-chopped silages at both maturities, while the quality of long-cut treated silages often appeared to be low. The variable efficiency of inoculation of whole crop cereals with LAB seems to be associated with types and numbers of epiphytic bacteria in the herbage. The inoculation of homofermentative LAB successfully reduced pH of both precision-chopped and long cut-silages but abundant production of lactic acid did not secure the <b>aerobic</b> <b>stability</b> of thes...|$|R
40|$|Ensiling {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{processes}} used as a conservation method for forages on farms and plays an important role in farm economics. Therefore, with the aim to improve the conservation and the nutritive value of silage, the utilization of silage additives such as fibrolytic enzymes (FE) and lactic acid bacteria (LAB) inoculants has been a common on-farm practice. FE are enzymes capable of breaking down complex polysaccharides such as cellulose and hemicellulose. The latter results in an increased substrate availability for epiphytic and inoculated LAB during silage fermentation, thus promoting a higher production of organic acids such as lactic acid and volatile fatty acids such as acetic acid, which are key acids to improve the conservation of the forage by reducing dry matter losses and <b>improving</b> <b>aerobic</b> <b>stability.</b> The degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose results in a partial degradation of fiber measured by the neutral detergent fiber (NDF) and acid detergent fiber (ADF) extraction technique. Therefore, FE could have the potential to improve ruminal fiber digestibility of treated forages. Alternatively, LAB inoculants are used as silage additives with the primary objective to dominate over the epiphytic bacteria present in silage, to accelerate the fermentation process, and to reinforce <b>aerobic</b> <b>stability</b> of the forage at feed out. Additionally, recent research has shown that certain strains of LAB might have the potential to partially degrade NDF and ADF during ensiling, therefore improving fiber digestibility. The first objective of this research project was to evaluate the effects of different mixtures of FE (a mixture of cellulase and xylanase (C+X); xylanase (X); ß-glucanase (G); a mixture of ß-glucanase and xylanase (G+X); and a negative control) on alfalfa harvested at early and late maturity, and stored for 40 or 120 d of ensiling. Alfalfa harvested at early maturity, treated with FE and ensiled for 40 d did not show significant improvements during ensiling in fiber degradability, fermentation characteristics or fiber digestibility in vitro assessed by the Tilley and Terry methodology. However, when harvested at late maturity and treated with a mixture of C+X; X and G+X, the NDF and ADF content at 40 d of ensiling tended to decrease. FE improved total volatile fatty acid production at 40 and 120 d of ensiling. Improvements in fiber digestibility were observed in vitro at 24 h for the C+X treatments. The results of this study suggest that the effects of FE are more pronounced in silages higher in fiber concentration, such as in the late-maturity alfalfa cut. The second objective of this research was to evaluate the effects of two homofermentative LAB (hoLAB) strains, and two heterofermentative LAB (htLAB) strains on alfalfa harvested at late maturity and stored for 40 or 120 d of ensiling. At 40 d of ensiling, hoLAB-treated silages had the greatest DM recovery and the lowest ADF concentration. Lactic acid production was greater for hoLAB-treated silages. At 120 d of ensiling, hoLAB-treated silages had the highest concentration in lactic acid whereas htLAB had the highest concentration in acetic acid and hoLAB-treated silages had the lowest ADF and NDF concentrations while htLAB tended to have higher NDF concentrations. Overall, it appears that the fiber degradation promoted during ensiling influenced digestibility depending upon hoLAB or htLAB inoculation, with hoLAB showing improved digestibility levels. The presented work suggests that certain FE can have the potential as a management resource on farms aiming to improve the nutritive value of forages with a high fiber concentration. As expected, hoLAB and htLAB inoculants improved the fermentation characteristics of alfalfa silage, but it was shown that LAB may exert a differential effect on fiber digestibility depending on their specific metabolism...|$|R
