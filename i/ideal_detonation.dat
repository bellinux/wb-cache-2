40|$|In a {{first part}} is {{presented}} {{the model of}} the <b>Ideal</b> <b>Detonation.</b> Emphasis is placed on the physical assumptions made in the setting and resolution of the continuum mechanics equations to be used. The basic elements of computations of <b>ideal</b> <b>detonation</b> parameters will be described. The experiments performed to check the predictions, and their results, will be reported. Some discussion of explosives in which chemical equilibrium is not reached, due to slow diffusive mixing of the reactants or to conditions where some of the reactions are very slow, will also be given. These explosives are often called non-ideal explosives. Obviously, when the reaction zone is not very thin relative to system dimensions, or when it is not very short relative to system times, the <b>Ideal</b> <b>Detonation</b> model, restricted to plane, steady flow, is inadequate. The third part of the paper is concerned with curved detonation fronts, and with time dependent processes. The steady detonation of small-diameter cylindrical cartridges will be discussed as one example, and the initiation of detonation in the shock-to-detonation transition as another. Detonation theory is not a closed subject, and much effort is currently being spent to extend classical theory. Some of the newer ideas will be introduced in a concluding part...|$|E
40|$|A simple yet fairly {{accurate}} {{method of}} calculating the <b>ideal</b> <b>detonation</b> velocity of an organic explosive from {{a knowledge of}} the chemical composition alone is proposed. The method is based on the concept that the energetics of a stoichiometrically balanced fuel-oxidizer system {{is a function of the}} total oxidizing or reducing valences of the composition. A combination of the valences in the form of Image, where R and P are, respectively, the reducing and oxidizing valences and MW is the molecular weight, has been found to be linearly related to the detonation velocity of the expolosive. The predicting capacity of the method has been found to be superior to other methods in the literature...|$|E
40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{established}} computer programs for the prediction of the <b>ideal</b> <b>detonation</b> characteristics of condensed phase energetic materials. These basically comprise thermochemical computer codes consisting of a chemical equilibrium solver for a number of phases having different equations of state (EoS), providing predictions of Chapman Jouguet and related detonation conditions. Many of these now employ sophisticated, intermolecular potential based EoS for fluid products but normally rely on very simple representations for solid and melt phase products and inert explosive components. The basic requirements of any solid EoS for these calculations are- the EoS should be a good representation of experimental Pressure-Volume-Temperature-Energy data and associated derivatives of these quantities for the particular phase and should be a thermodynamically complete EoS- the predicted thermodynamic parameters for a given phase should be in analytic form and without discontinuities- the EoS should contain parameters that are readily measurable and the number of parameters should be in accord with available experimental or theoretical data- the EoS should not carry an excessive computational cost In recent years the Vinet “universal ” EoS has been modified and extended to enable the description of solid and melt phases for condensed phase detonation product species, both ionic and covalent. Solid products in both commercial explosives and insensitive heterogeneous munitions can {{have a significant effect on}} the detonation characteristics and associated isentropic expansions, because of the form of the solid/melt EoS. A number of solids EoS have been incorporated into a modern <b>ideal</b> <b>detonation</b> computer code and the paper will compare detonation characteristics for a typical explosive. The application of this EoS to the description of the unreacted Hugoniot of a multi-phase explosive and predictions of shock temperatures will also be discussed...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} is on {{experimental studies of}} the pulse of detonation engine (PDE) at High Speed Reacting Flow Laboratory (HiREF) where the pulse detonation engine was equipped with a new design of a fuel-air premixed intake system. Pulse detonation engine is a power conversion device with simple mechanism and yet efficient. A premixed intake system is fabricated and assembled with a detonation tube with dimension of 50 mm inner diameter and 600 mm in length. Stoichiometric condition of fuel-air mixture for repetitive high-speed combustion is prepared for the pulse detonation engine with operating frequency system of 5 Hz. Fuel and oxidizer are injected using gas injectors into air flow in intake system manifolds that connected to mixing chamber and detonation tube. The pressure produced in the tube is measured using pressure transducers located along the detonation tube. The pulse detonation engine model is evaluated with thermodynamics theory models; <b>Ideal</b> pulse <b>detonation</b> engine (PDE), Brayton cycle and Humphrey cycle. The thermodynamic cycle efficiency of the pulse detonation engine is analyzed and compared with non-premixed pulse detonation engine for evaluation. The simulation result indicated that ideal PDE operates at 0. 24 thermal efficiency. The <b>ideal</b> pulse <b>detonation</b> engine is predicted to produce 276. 3 N with generated impulse up to 68. 5 s in stoichiometric condition of propane and air mixtures...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{introducing}} a spatial heterogeneity into an explosive medium is studied computationally {{by examining the}} detonation velocity near the limit to propagation in a thin explosive layer. The explosive system studied is an ideal gas with a single exothermic reaction governed by a pressure-dependent reaction rate ($p^n$) with a pressure exponent of $n = 3 $. A pressure-dependent reaction rate, rather than the exponential dependence of reaction on temperature of Arrhenius kinetics, is used so that the detonation wave is stable in the homogeneous case and can be modelled with simple, analytical techniques, and thus the effect of introducing heterogeneity can be clearly identified. The two-dimensional slab of explosive is bounded by a layer of inert gas with the same thermodynamic properties as the explosive. The heterogeneity is introduced into the explosive via a large-amplitude, two-dimensional sinusoidal ripple in density in the initialization of the simulation, while maintaining a constant pressure. The computational simulations are initialized with a ZND solution for the <b>ideal</b> CJ <b>detonation,</b> and the detonation is allowed to propagate into the explosive layer. The simulations show that the detonation in the heterogeneous media exhibits a cellular-like structure of complex shock interactions. The detonation is able to propagate into a significantly thinner layer of explosive and can exhibit a greater velocity than the corresponding homogeneous case. A parametric study of varying the wavelength of the sinusoid shows {{the existence of an}} optimal size of heterogeneity at which the favorable effect is the greatest corresponding to a wavelength that is approximately 10 to 50 times the half reaction zone length of the <b>ideal</b> CJ <b>detonation.</b> As the wavelength is decreased {{to the size of the}} reaction zone length, the behavior reverts back to the homogeneous case...|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedTheory predicts <b>ideal</b> pulse <b>detonation</b> technology offers significant fuel efficiency advantages over ramjet/scramjet architecture within a range from high subsonic to low hypersonic velocities. In practice, Pulse Detonation Engines (PDE) require implementation of loss-inducing {{techniques such as}} turbulence-generation devices to achieve and sustain detonation events, which effectively narrows the efficiency {{gap between the two}} technologies. Pressure losses associated with such obstacles lower system specific thrust (Isp) and reduce overall system performance. Although fundamental PDE research has been ongoing at NPS for seven years, no dedicated attempt has been made to accurately measure the experimental performance. Fuel-based Isp {{is a function of the}} ratio of thrust produced to fuel mass flow rate; thus, accurate computation requires precise knowledge of both thrust and input fuel. This thesis focused on creating an accurate thrust collection system incorporating an existing, uncalibrated rocket thrust stand. An in depth, axial component thrust calibration was conducted for the stand itself, then with the engine mounted in the firing configuration. As expected, harmonic responses of the stand during detonation experimentation were experienced which required creation and implementation of filtering algorithms to successfully extract useful thrust values.

40|$|Commercial {{explosives}} behave non-ideally in rock blasting. A {{direct and}} convenient measure of non-ideality is the detonation velocity. In this study, an alternative model fitted to experimental unconfined detonation velocity data is proposed {{and the effect}} of confinement on the detonation velocity is modelled. Unconfined data of several explosives showing various levels of nonideality were successfully modelled. The effect of confinement on detonation velocity was modelled empirically based on field detonation velocity measurements. Confined detonation velocity {{is a function of the}} <b>ideal</b> <b>detonation</b> velocity, unconfined detonation velocity at a given blasthole diameter and rock stiffness. For a given explosive and charge diameter, as confinement increases detonation velocity increases. The confinement model is implemented in a simple engineering based non-ideal detonation model. A number of simulations are carried out and analysed to predict the explosive performance parameters for the adopted blasting conditions...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a pipe or tube containing a flammable gaseous mixture {{and subjected to}} an internal detonation. When the detonation impacts the closed end of the tube, a reflected shock wave is created to bring the flow back to rest. This shock propagates into the unsteady flow field behind the detonation. In shock tube experiments, {{it has been observed}} (e. g., Mark, 1958; Petersen and Hanson, 2006) that a reflecting shock wave may bifurcate (split into an oblique and normal wave) near the wall when it interacts with the boundary layer created by the incident shock. We suspect an analogous event is occurring in detonation reflection. Pressure records from detonations in stoichiometric ethylene-oxygen at initial pressure 0. 5 bar show measured shock speeds that are inconsistent with the measured pressure jump across the reflected shock wave. Highly resolved, two-dimensional numerical simulations of compressible viscous flow demonstrate the bifurcation of the reflecting shock wave from the reflection of an <b>ideal</b> <b>detonation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Thermochemical {{equilibrium}} calculations {{have been}} used to calculate detonation conditions for typical firework components including three report charges, two display charges, and black powder which is used as a fuse or launch charge. Calculations were performed with {{a modified version of the}} TIGER code which allows calculations with 900 gaseous and 600 condensed product species at high pressure. The detonation calculations presented in this paper are thought to be the first report on the theoretical study of firework detonation. Measured velocities for two report charges are available and compare favorably to predicted detonation velocities. However, the measured velocities may not be true detonation velocities. Fast deflagration rather than an <b>ideal</b> <b>detonation</b> occurs when reactants contain significant amounts of slow reacting constituents such as aluminum or titanium. Despite such uncertainties in reacting pyrotechnics, the detonation calculations do show the complex nature of condensed phase formation at elevated pressures and give an upper bound for measured velocities...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{investigates the}} {{applications}} of steady and unsteady detonation waves to air-breathing propulsion systems. The efficiency of ideal detonation-based propulsion systems is first investigated based on thermodynamics. We reformulate the Hugoniot analysis of steady combustion waves for a fixed initial stagnation state {{to conclude that}} steady detonation waves are less desirable than deflagrations for propulsion. However, a thermostatic approach shows that unsteady detonations {{have the potential for}} generating more work than constant-pressure combustion. The subsequent work focuses on specific engine concepts. A flow path analysis of <b>ideal</b> steady <b>detonation</b> engines is conducted and shows that their performance is limited and poorer than that of the ideal ramjet or turbojet engines. The limitations {{associated with the use of}} a steady detonation in the combustor are drastic and such engines do not appear to be practical. This leads us to focus on unsteady detonation engines, i. e., pulse detonation engnes. The unsteady generation of thrust in the simple configuration of a detonation tube is first analyzed using gas dynamics. We develop one of the first models to quickly and reliably estimate the impulse of a pulse detonation tube. The impulse is found to scale directly with the mass of explosive in the tube and the square root of the energy release per unit mass of the mixture. Impulse values for typical fuel-oxidizer mixtures are found to be on the order of 160 s for hydrocarbon-oxygen mixtures and 120 s for fuel-air mixtures at standard conditions. These results are then used as a basis to develop the first complete system-level performance analysis of a supersonic, single-tube, air-breathing pulse detonation engine. We show that hydrogen- and JP 10 -fueled pulse detonation engines generate thrust up to a Mach number of 4, and that the specific impulse decreases quasi-linearly with increasing flight Mach number. Finally, we find that the performance of our pulse detonation engine exceeds that of the ramjet below a Mach number of 1. 35...|$|R
40|$|The {{propagation}} of detonation waves in reactive media bounded by an inert, compressible layer is examined via computational simulations {{in two different}} geometries, axisymmetric cylinders and two dimensional, planar slabs. For simplicity, an ideal gas equation of state is used with a pressure-dependent reaction rate that results in a stable detonation wave structure. The detonation is initiated as an <b>ideal</b> Chapman-Jouguet (CJ) <b>detonation</b> with a one-dimensional structure, and then allowed to propagate into a finite diameter or thickness layer of explosive surrounded by an inert layer. The yielding confinement of the inert layer results in the detonation wave decaying to a sub-CJ steady state velocity or failing entirely. Simulations are performed with different values of the reaction rate pressure exponent (n = 2 and 3) and different impedance confinement (greater than, less than, and equal to the confinement of the explosive). The velocity decrement and critical dimension (critical diameter or thickness) are determined, and a 2 : 1 scaling between the cylinder diameter and slab thickness results is confirmed, in good agreement with curvature-based models of detonation propagation. The measured shock front curvature and detonation velocity relation agrees with the classic model of Wood and Kirkwood. The computational simulations are compared to a simple, analytic model that treats {{the interaction of the}} confinement with the detonation products via Newtonian theory and a model that assumes a continuous variation in shock front curvature with the shock angle at the interface with the confinement matching the angle determined by shock polar analysis. The Newtonian model works very well for the case of high impedance confinement, while the shock front curvature model agrees with the simulations for the case of low impedance confinement...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAmmonium-nitrate-based {{explosives}} used by {{the mining}} industry exhibit strong non-ideal detonation behaviour. Detonation velocities in rate-sticks with radii close to the failure radius, can be as low as {{one third of the}} <b>ideal</b> <b>detonation</b> velocity, which poses a significant challenge for their accurate predictive computational modelling. Given that these emulsions are highly heterogeneous, multi-phase formulations are well suited for their representation in numerical hydrocodes. To this end, a single-pressure, single-velocity multi-phase model is employed for the simulation of an explosive emulsion widely {{used by the}} mining industry. The model is modified to rectify a problem related to the calculation of a unique detonation state, and is evaluated using a high-resolution, shock-capturing Riemann problem-based scheme. In order to perform high-resolution numerical simulations at a reduced cost, a shock-following method is implemented and validated against the full-domain solutions. An improved iterative fitting procedure for steady-state detonation kinetics is also presented. Validation against experimental evidence shows that the model can reproduce confined VOD experimental data, solely by adjusting the reaction kinetics to match unconfined experimental VOD data. Furthermore, the model can match experimental front curvature measurement without further adjustments. (c) 2013 The Combustion Institute. Published by Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|PETN {{is widely}} {{recognized}} {{as an example of}} nearly <b>ideal</b> <b>detonation</b> performance. The chemical composition is such that little or no carbon is produced in the detonation products. The reaction zone width is less than currently detectable. (< 1 ns) Observations on PETN have thus become a baseline for EOS model predictions. It has therefore become important to characterize the detonation parameters as accurately as possible in order to provide the most exacting comparisons of EOS predictions with experimental results. We undertook a painstaking review of the detonation pressure measurements reported in an earlier work that was presented at the Fifth Detonation Symposium and found that corrections were required in determining the shock velocity in the PMMA witness material. We also refined the impedance calculation to account for the difference between the usual ''acoustic'' method and the more accurate Riemann integral. Our review indicates that the CJ pressures previously reported for full density PETN require an average lowering of about 6 percent. The lower densities require progressively smaller corrections. We present analysis of the records, supporting hydrodynamic simulations, the Riemann integral results, and EOS parameter values derived from the revised results...|$|E
40|$|Detonation {{waves in}} {{gas-filled}} piping or tubing pose special challenges in analysis and prediction of structural response. The challenges arise due {{the nature of}} the detonation process and the role of fluid-structure interaction in determining the propagation and arrest of fractures. Over the past ten years, our laboratory has been engaged in studying this problem and developing methodologies for estimating structural response. A brief overview of detonation waves and some key issues relevant to structural waves is presented first. This is followed by a summary of our work on the elastic response of tubes and pipes to <b>ideal</b> <b>detonation</b> loading, highlighting the importance of detonation wave speed in determining flexural wave excitation and possibility of resonant response leading to large deformations. Some issues in measurement technique and validation testing are then presented. The importance of wave reflection from bends, valves and dead ends is discussed, as well as the differences between detonation, shock wave, and uniform internal pressure loading. Following this, we summarize our experimental findings on the fracture threshold of thin-walled tubes with pre-existing flaws. A particularly important issue for hazard analysis is the estimation of loads associated with flame acceleration and deflagration-todetonation transition. We give some recent results on pressure and elastic strain measurements in the transition regime for a thick-wall piping, and some remarks about plastic deformation...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{has been}} carried out at BAE Systems Hägglunds, a company in Örnsköldsvik which {{develops}} and produces military vehicles. The main focus in this thesis is numerical studies of non-ideal detonations such as those which arise when using ANFO as the main explosive in a charge. ANFO is a mix of ammonium nitrate and fuel oil and often used as an improvised explosive device in terrorism activities. A non-ideal detonation means that the reaction zone is much longer than for an <b>ideal</b> <b>detonation</b> and may not be assumed to have an abrupt discontinuity. In other studies this phenomenon has shown to cause special properties, for instance a detonation velocity that depends heavily on charge radius and external confinement. In this study the purpose and aim is to show this behaviour in simulations with the finite element code LS-DYNA. The simulations were performed with cylindrical charges modelled in 2 D in axi-symmetry. The explosive was modelled either by the Jones-Wilkins-Lee equation of state or by the more advanced ignition and growth reactive flow model. A comparison between the two is made and the result shows that the ignition and growth in a good way confirm the behaviour of a non-ideal detonation. The conclusions are that the ignition and growth reactive flow model seems to be an adequate method to simulate non-ideal explosives. More material parameters for ANFO would thou be needed, now it was rather limited and own assumptions had to be made in order to use the Ignition and growth model. In the future a combination of the ignition and growth model and a more advanced equation of state, such as Williamsburg, might be an even better way to describe a non-ideal detonation. The most important thou would be more experimental data to validate the simulations with ignition and growth against. Validerat; 20110526 (anonymous...|$|E
40|$|The {{propagation}} of non-ideal detonations arising from friction, heat transfer and reactions steps involving a competition between exothermic and endothermic reactions (pathological detonations) {{has been studied}} theoretically by including source terms in the 1 -D conservation equations of momentum and energy. To predict the steady-state non-ideal detonation velocity, the detailed structure of the detonation has been considered. The Generalized C-J Criterion {{has been used to}} seek a singularity-free solution from the whole spectrum of possible solutions to the differential equations for the structure. For pathological detonations, the steady-state analysis predicts a detonation velocity in excess of the ideal C-J value in the H 2 [...] Cl 2 mixture, in agreement with experimental observations. Unsteady pathological detonation calculations with a simplified two-rate law model have also been carried out. The resulting asymptotically stable detonations are found to be in agreement with the steady-state predictions. For non-ideal detonations due to friction, the Generalized C-J criterion is found to break down for very low detonation velocities. An alternative criterion based on matching the detonation wave with the back boundary condition is used instead. A continuous spectrum of steady-state solutions has been found for detonation velocities ranging from the ideal C-J value down to that of a sonic wave. For activation energies above some critical value, multiple steady-state solutions have been found for a given friction factor, and various detonation regimes have been defined. An unsteady analysis of the transient development of non-ideal detonations due to friction has been carried out to determine whether the solutions from the steady-state analysis can be approached asymptotically. Friction and heat transfer are found to increase the instability of the detonation wave. Oscillatory and even chaotic detonations were observed for values of the activation energies corresponding to stable detonations in absence of source terms (<b>ideal</b> <b>detonation).</b> Moreover, the transient analysis has revealed {{that in the case of}} multiple steady-state solutions, only that with the highest detonation velocity could be approached asymptotically. The transient results of detonation with friction and heat transfer have been found to be in qualitative agreement with the experimental gaseous detonations propagating in porous media and in obstacle fields...|$|E
