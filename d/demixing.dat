50|$|Polymer-polymer systems. In a Polymer-polymer system, both phases are {{generated}} by a dissolved polymer. The heavy phase will generally be Polyethylene glycol (PEG), and the light phase is generally a polysaccharide. Traditionally, the polymer used is dextran. However, dextran is relatively expensive, and research has been exploring using less expensive polysaccharides to generate the light phase. If the target compound being separated is a protein or enzyme, {{it is possible to}} incorporate a ligand to the target into one of the polymer phases. This improves the target's affinity to that phase, and improves its ability to partition from one phase into the other. This, as well as the absence of solvents or other denaturing agents, makes polymer-polymer extractions an attractive option for purifying proteins. The two phases of a polymer-polymer system often have very similar densities, and very low surface tension between them. Because of this, <b>demixing</b> a polymer-polymer system is often much more difficult than <b>demixing</b> a solvent extraction.

Throughout his career as a soil scientist, he made many contributions to clay mineralogy, including developing a model describing the relationship between cation selectivity and the extent of crystalline swelling in expanding 2:1 phyllosilicates. [...] Other work demonstrated the effects of ionic strength and cation charge on the breakup and formation of smectitic quasicrystals and the principle of cation <b>demixing</b> which lent great insight into understanding clay flocculation. Investigations in organic matter interactions with clay minerals {{led to the development of}} the idea of dual mode bonding in which amphipathic molecules interact with substrates by both hydrophobic-hydrophobic and hydrophilic-hydrophilic interactions. Laird et al. (2008) showed that smectites, a class of clay minerals found in soil, can adsorb tremendous amounts of organic materials and, hence, strongly influence the transport and bioavailability of organic materials including pesticides applied to the soil. [...] In a study published in 2003, Gonzalez and Laird showed that new carbon derived from decomposing plant material tends to preferentially sorb to the fine clay subfraction of soil.

40|$|The {{influence}} of liquid-liquid <b>demixing,</b> solid-liquid <b>demixing,</b> and vitrification on the membrane morphologies obtained from several polylactide-solvent-nonsolvent systems has been investigated. The polymers investigated were the semicrystalline poly-L-lactide (PLLA) and the amorphous poly-DL-lactide (PDLLA). The solvent-nonsolvent systems used were dioxane-water, N-methyl pyrrolidone-water and dioxane-methanol. For {{each of these}} systems it was attempted to relate the membrane morphology to the ternary phase diagram at 25 °C.
