5|$|Market {{and brand}} focused {{organizations}} {{are concerned with}} the expression and perception of the corporate brand. Corporate design management implements, develops, and maintains the corporate identity, or brand.

The design program plays the role of a quality program within many fields of the organization to achieve uniform internal branding. It <b>is</b> <b>strongly</b> linked to strategy, corporate culture, product development, marketing, organizational structure, and technological development. Achieving a consistent corporate brand requires the involvement of designers and a widespread design awareness among employees.
