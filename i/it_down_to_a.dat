5|$|During {{production}} Burtt had {{the opportunity}} to look at the items used by Jimmy MacDonald, Disney's in-house sound designer for many of their classic films. Burtt used many of MacDonald's items on WALL-E. Because Burtt was not simply adding sound effects in post-production, the animators were always evaluating his new creations and ideas, which Burtt found an unusual experience. He worked in sync with the animators, returning their animation after adding the sounds to give them more ideas. Burtt would choose scientifically accurate sounds for each character, but if he could not find one that worked, he would choose a dramatic and unrealistic noise. Burtt would find hundreds of sounds by looking at concept art of characters, before he and Stanton pared <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> distinct few for each robot.|$|E
5|$|North Korean {{prisoners of}} war {{captured}} by the US troops during the battle reported that the NK 3rd Division suffered about 2,000 casualties, mostly from artillery fire, in the attack on Yongdong on July 24–25. This brought <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> strength of about 5,000 men, approximately half the strength it had when the war began. The 1st Cavalry Division's actions were able to delay the North Korean advance for several days, giving the UN forces valuable time {{to set up the}} Pusan Perimeter. The UN losses after this battle and the subsequent fight at Hwanggan cost the 1st Cavalry Division 916 casualties. The defeat was a poor showing for the division, but its record quickly improved with experience and it became a more reliable fighting unit {{by the time it was}} placed on Pusan Perimeter.|$|E

25|$|Along with {{a number}} of other Soviet chess champions, he signed a {{petition}} condemning the actions of the defector Viktor Korchnoi in 1976. It was the continuation of a bitter feud between the two, dating back at least to their 1974 Candidates semifinal match in which Petrosian withdrew after five games while trailing 3½–1½ (+3−1=1). His match with Korchnoi in 1977 saw the two former colleagues refuse to shake hands or speak to each other. They even demanded separate eating and toilet facilities. Petrosian went on to lose the match and was subsequently fired as editor of Russia's largest chess magazine, 64. His detractors condemned his reluctance to attack and some put <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> lack of courage. At this point however, Botvinnik spoke out on his behalf, stating that he only attacked when he felt secure and his greatest strength was in defence.|$|E
25|$|Lisch's {{production}} {{dropped off}} as the 2016–17 season came to a close, with the Kings management putting <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> mixture of niggling injuries, his workload, {{and the fact that}} he'd just come off an Olympic campaign with the Australian Boomers in August 2016. Aimed at resolving a nagging injury that curtailed his performance in 2016–17, Lisch underwent minor knee surgery during the off-season, with a healthy Kevin Lisch being the recipe for Sydney Kings success in 2017–18 according to Kings Managing Director Jeff Van Groningen. The Kings front office remained confident during the 2017 off-season that Lisch was the man for the job, despite calls for the Kings to go after the likes of Jerome Randle or Casper Ware. After an off-season of rest and a training schedule refinement, Lisch entered the 2017–18 season ready to redeem himself.|$|E

25|$|Back in the present, an {{encounter}} with Kulan Gath results in Pym being split into his two personas of Pym and Yellowjacket, after a spell cast by Gath temporarily transforms Pym into a swashbuckler-style Yellowjacket, followed by the Yellowjacket persona manifesting a physical presence from the extradimensional bio-mass Pym uses to grow. After the Giant-Man Pym spends some time appearing almost emotionally stunted, reciting facts with no sense of emotional depth even when facing the new threat of a supercharged Count Nefaria, the Yellowjacket Pym replaces him, only for his impulsive nature to making a situation worse when Diablo turns an entire village into variations of the Hulk, Yellowjacket's plan to stop the Hulks resulting in them merging into one massive Hulk before he can shrink <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more manageable level. The two versions begin to deteriorate from being apart, but are restored when the Wasp helps the two halves realize they need each other. Pym is eventually able to resolve his problems and adopts his Yellowjacket persona once again.|$|E

500|$|On Burton's hiring, he and Logan {{reworked}} the screenplay; Logan {{felt they}} agreed over the film's tone due to [...] "share stunted childhoods watching Amicus movies".

Burton said [...] "In terms of the show, it was three hours long, but we weren't out to film the Broadway show, we were {{out to make a}} movie, so we tried to keep the pace like those old melodramas. Sondheim himself is not a real big fan of movie musicals, so he was really open to honing <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> more pacey shape."

He was also satisfied with the 15% royalties he received as songwriter credit. Madonna took 30% royalties, another 15% were given to Maldoon's estate and the rest were earned by Madonna's record company. The singer said about the song: [...] "It's totally out of control.

500|$|Nomura {{sought to}} make Cloud's design [...] "distinctly {{different}} from the other characters." [...] About thirty different designs were made for Cloud's face, and his hair was altered both to give it a more realistic look and to illustrate that two years had passed since the game's conclusion. The staff attempted rendering Cloud based on the game's original illustrations, but concluded that doing so left his eyes unrealistically big, which [...] "looked gross." [...] Further revisions were made to Cloud's face after completion of the pilot film, which featured a more realistic style. In contrast to his hair, Cloud's clothes were difficult to make in the film. Deciding to give Cloud a simple costume consistent with the concept of [...] "clothes designed for action", the staff began {{with the idea of a}} black robe, eventually parring <b>it</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> [...] "long apron" [...] shifted to one side. Cloud's weaponry was based on the joking observation that because his sword in the original game was already enormously tall, in the sequel, he should use sheer numbers. Referred to as [...] "the fusion swords" [...] during the film's development, early storyboard concepts included Cloud carrying six swords on his back, although the idea was later modified to six interlocking swords. While the idea wasn't [...] "logically thought out" [...] and the staff didn't think that they could [...] "make it work physically", it was believed to provide [...] "an interesting accent to the story." [...] Cloud's new motorcycle, , was designed by Takayuki Takeya, who was asked by the staff to design an upgraded version of Cloud's [...] "Hardy-Daytona" [...] motorcycle from Final Fantasy VII. As development continued, the bike got bigger, with Takeya feeling its heaviness provided an impact that worked well within the film.|$|E
