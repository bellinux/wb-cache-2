In present Internet it is observed that inefficiency is created in Internet Protocol (IP) networking due to the location based packet delivery. The inefficiency comes in the environment when more objects or devices are mobile and there is chance of existence of multiple copies. Device-to-Device networking in non-stationary communication, identification of device should not be done by its location but identifier (ID) is used. Thing should be identified by its identifier (ID) rather than its location. In addition, the ID should provide compatibility with existing <b>device</b> <b>IDs.</b> The Identifier <b>ID</b> and existing <b>device</b> <b>IDs</b> must be compatible with one another.

50|$|The Subsystem ID (SSID) and the Subsystem Vendor ID (SVID) {{differentiate}} specific model (such as an add-in card).

The Subsystem ID is assigned by the subsystem vendor from the same number space as the <b>Device</b> <b>ID.</b> As an example, in the case of wireless network cards, the chipset manufacturer might be Broadcom or Atheros, and the card manufacturer might be Netgear or D-Link. Generally, the Vendor ID - <b>Device</b> <b>ID</b> combination designates which driver the host should load in order to handle the device, as all cards with the same VID:DID combination can be handled by the same driver. The Subsystem Vendor ID - Subsystem ID combination identifies the card, which is kind of information the driver may use to apply a minor card-specific change in its operation.|$|E
