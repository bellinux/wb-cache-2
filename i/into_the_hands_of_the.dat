5|$|As {{a result}} of the finger spinners' success, Australian captain Ian Johnson tried to convert Davidson into a left arm {{orthodox}} spinner. Davidson returned as Australia faced a fourth meeting with Laker and Lock, in a match against Surrey immediately after the two consecutive Test maulings. On a sticky wicket that played <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Surrey spinners, Australia were skittled for 143. Only Davidson, who took the attack to the pair, made 44 not out. One six that he lofted from Laker almost reached the iconic gasometer outside The Oval. The match was drawn, and Davidson took 2/50 including Eric Bedser and Laker in his new role as a slow bowler.|$|E
5|$|Clare Castle is {{a medieval}} castle {{in the small}} town of Clare in Suffolk, England. Built shortly after the Norman conquest of England by Richard Fitz Gilbert, the motte and bailey castle was later {{improved}} in stone. In the 14th century the castle was the home of Elizabeth de Clare, one of the richest women in England, who maintained a substantial household there. The castle passed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Crown, and by the 16th century was in ruins. Damaged by the construction of the Great Eastern Railway through the castle in 1867, the remains of the castle are now part of a local park and a scheduled monument and a grade 2* listed building.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in his}} tenure, Kosygin {{challenged}} Brezhnev's {{right as}} general secretary to represent the country abroad, a function Kosygin believed should fall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>hands</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> head of government, as was common in non-communist countries. This was actually implemented for a short period, which led Henry A. Kissinger to believe that Kosygin {{was the leader of}} the Soviet Union. Kosygin, who had been the chief negotiator with the First World during the 1960s, was hardly to be seen outside the Second World after Brezhnev consolidated his position within the Politburo, but also due to Andrei Gromyko's dislike of Kosygin meddling into his own ministerial affairs.|$|E
