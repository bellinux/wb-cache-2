6000|$|Now {{in those}} days my sight was very good, and while the men were yet some way off I studied them all and {{made up my mind}} about them. First there was a large young man of five-and-twenty or thereabouts, and I noted with a sort of fear that he was not unlike to Ralph. The eyes were the same and the shape of the forehead, only this gentleman had a weak, {{uncertain}} mouth, and I judged that he was very good-humoured, but of an indolent mind. By his side rode another man of quite a different stamp, and middle-aged. [...] "The lawyer," [...] I said to myself as I looked at his weasel-like face, bushy eyebrows, and red hair. Indeed, that was an easy guess, for who can mistake a lawyer, whatever his race may be? That trade is stronger than any blood, and leaves the same seal on all who follow it. Doubtless if those lawyers of whom the Lord speaks hard things in the Testament were set {{side by side with the}} lawyers who draw mortgage bonds and practise usury <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>South</b> Africa, they would prove to be as like to each other as are the grains of corn upon one mealie cob. Yes, when, all dressed the same, they stand together among the goats on the last day few indeed will know them apart.|$|E

60|$|Is {{there any}} presentable living soul in the {{neighborhood}} whom we can invite to meet her? Not one. There are, as I have already said, no country seats near us; and society in the county town has long since learned to regard us as three misanthropes, strongly suspected, from our monastic {{way of life and}} our dismal black costume, of being popish priests in disguise. In other parts of England the clergyman of the parish might help us out of our difficulty; but <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>South</b> Wales, and in this latter half of the nineteenth century, we have the old type parson of the days of Fielding still in a state of perfect preservation. Our local clergyman receives a stipend which is too paltry to bear comparison with the wages of an ordinary mechanic. In dress, manners, and tastes he is about on a level with the upper class of agricultural laborer. When attempts have been made by well-meaning gentlefolks to recognize the claims of his profession by asking him to their houses, he has been known, on more than one occasion, to leave his plowman's pair of shoes in the hall, and enter the drawing-room respectfully in his stockings. Where he preaches, miles and miles away from us and from the poor cottage in which he lives, if he sees any of the company in the squire's pew yawn or fidget in their places, he takes it as a hint that they are tired of listening, and closes his sermon instantly {{at the end of the}} sentence. Can we ask this most irreverend and unclerical of men to meet a young lady? I doubt, even if we made the attempt, whether we should succeed, by fair means, in getting him beyond the servants' hall.|$|E
60|$|But <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>South</b> Main Street, at {{the time}} of which I am writing, there was an inn, or public-house, called the Kanturk Hotel. In dear old Ireland they have some foibles, {{and one of them is}} a passion for high nomenclature. Those who are {{accustomed}} to the sort of establishments which are met with in England, and much more in Germany and Switzerland, under the name of hotels, might be surprised to see the place in South Main Street which had been dignified with the same appellation. It was a small, dingy house of three stories, the front door of which was always open, and the passage strewed with damp, dirty straw. On the left-hand side as you entered was a sitting-room, or coffee-room as it was announced to be by an appellation painted on the door. There was but one window to the room, which looked into the street, and was always clouded by a dingy-red curtain. The floor was uncarpeted, nearly black with dirt, and usually half covered with fragments of damp straw brought into it by the feet of customers. A strong smell of hot whisky and water always prevailed, and the straggling mahogany table in the centre of the room, whose rickety legs gave way and came off whenever an attempt was made to move it, was covered by small greasy circles, the impressions of the bottoms of tumblers which had been made by the overflowing tipple. Over the chimney there was a round mirror, the framework of which was bedizened with all manner of would-be gilt ornaments, which had been cracked, and twisted, and mended till it was impossible to know what they had been intended to represent; and the whole affair had become a huge receptacle of dust, which fell in flakes upon the chimney-piece when it was invaded. There was a second table opposite the window, more rickety than that in the centre; and against the wall opposite to the fireplace there was an old sideboard, in the drawers of which Tom, the one-eyed waiter, kept knives and forks, and candle-ends, and bits of bread, and dusters. There was a sour smell, as of old rancid butter, about the place, to which the guests sometimes objected, little inclined as they generally were to be fastidious. But this was a tender subject, and not often alluded to by those who wished to stand well in the good graces of Tom. Many things much annoyed Tom; but nothing annoyed him so fearfully as any assertion that the air of the Kanturk Hotel was not perfectly sweet and wholesome.|$|E

He stated that: Never, ever did I think {{that there would be}} a debate in this arid country about which was more important - gas or water. We can survive without gas... We cannot live without water. If we damage our limited water supply - and fracking will do just that - we will have conflict again <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>South</b> Africa. His final statement was: I have no doubt, that in the end, good will triumph over evil. After Pugh's speech, Bonang Mohale, Shell's representative, announced in reference to fracking that: We will leave the Karoo better than it was when we found it, and: There is zero chance that there will be any contamination of the water. Mohale was effectively silenced by his colleagues after ongoing derision at his statements from the public. Shell was also asked what would happen to the gas. A Shell representative replied that: Shell doesn't expect the gas reserves to be very large, therefore they will be generating electricity and distributing it directly. Shell also agreed to disclose the chemicals they would use in fracking, their water sources and waste disposal methodology. To date (February 2014), Shell has not been forthcoming with any of these details.|$|E

The event was intended to [...] "lead discussion around what a Nuclear Energy future in South Australia could look like and provide opportunity for CEDA members to feed into the Royal Commission into Nuclear Energy." [...] At the event, Stone claimed that nuclear energy was cheaper to generate than renewable energy, saying:"When you work out {{the cost of the}} electricity {{over the life of the}} (nuclear) kit…it is a lot cheaper than the honest number for renewables... If you add the cost of that (production) plus the cost of intermittency support, it’s a lot more expense and this is the issue where we need to get rational conversations."On 17 March, Stone presented at an event hosted by the South Australian Chamber of Mines & Energy. Nuclear power advocates Ben Heard of ThinkClimate Consulting and Ian Hore-Lacy of the World Nuclear Association also spoke at the event. Stone introduced himself as [...] "kind of Chief Trouble-maker" [...] before saying [...] "I'm not actually pro-nuclear- provided it's cheap, safe and low carbon, I'm very happy and this is where nuclear fits in the process." [...] His presentation provided background on nuclear power in the United Kingdom and offered advice for Australia. He said:"You only get one chance at this, this is a really important point <b>here</b> <b>in</b> <b>South</b> Australia. You've now kicked this process off. This is a once in a generation discussion. If it goes wrong now, it's your kids who will have it next time round. It won't slip for an election period, because people's memories for this stuff are long."He noted that polling in the UK had showed that women are more cautious than men when considering supporting nuclear power, and said that he would like to see more women enter the industry. He told the attendees that:"Everything you do is about creating trust and confidence. People opening their mouths and coming up with bright ideas that in any way damage that, need taking outside and dealing with... This is about national economic competitiveness.
