25|$|Each barrel is a {{very simple}} non-automatic design having its own breech and bolt. Like the {{original}} Gatling gun, the entire firing cycle <b>is</b> <b>actuated</b> by cams and powered by {{the rotation of the}} barrels. The seven-barrel carriage assembly itself is driven by the aircraft's dual hydraulic system.|$|E
25|$|The keys of the {{keyboard}} are connected by vertical pushrods to the escapements. When a key is pressed, the corresponding escapement <b>is</b> <b>actuated,</b> which releases a matrix from the magazine. With one exception, each key corresponds {{directly to a}} channel in the standard (90channel) magazine. The one exception is the lower-case letter e: that letter is used so often that the 90 channel magazine actually has 91 channels, with two channels (the leftmost two) both used for the letter e. Similarly, the 72channel magazine actually has 73channels, with the leftmost two being used for lower-case e. Alternate lines release matrices alternately from the two e channels in the magazine.|$|E
25|$|The Shaktis took {{a further}} step. Their ideology, based mainly on tantras, sees Shakti as the {{principle}} of energy through which all divinity functions, thus showing the masculine as depending on the feminine. In the great shakta scripture known as the Devi Mahatmya, all the goddesses are aspects of one presiding female force—one in truth and many in expression—giving {{the world and the}} cosmos the galvanic energy for motion. It expresses through philosophical tracts and metaphor, that the potentiality of masculine being <b>is</b> <b>actuated</b> by the feminine divine. More recently, the Indian author Rajesh Talwar has critiqued Western religion and written eloquently on the sacred feminine {{in the context of the}} North Indian Goddess Vaishno Devi.|$|E
30|$|Other {{important}} elements in soft robotics are suction cups. Three types of suction cups can be currently {{found in the}} literature: suction cups that <b>are</b> <b>actuated</b> by a dielectric elastomer [23], suction cups that <b>are</b> <b>actuated</b> by negative [24], and suction cups that <b>are</b> <b>actuated</b> by positive air pressure [25]. The latter type {{is based on the}} pneu-net principle from [6].|$|R

50|$|Depending on {{the design}} used, the valves <b>are</b> <b>actuated</b> {{directly}} by a rocker arm, finger, or bucket tappet. Overhead camshaft engines use fingers or bucket tappets, upon which the cam lobes contact, while pushrod engines use rocker arms. Rocker arms <b>are</b> <b>actuated</b> by a pushrod, and pivot on a shaft or individual ball studs in order to actuate the valves.|$|R
2500|$|The Enzo Ferrari is a 12 {{cylinder}} mid-engine berlinetta {{sports car}} {{named after the}} company's founder, Enzo Ferrari. It was built in 2002 using Formula One technology, such as a carbon-fibre body, F1-style electrohydraulic shift transmission, and carbon fibre-reinforced silicon carbide (C/SiC) ceramic composite disc brakes. Also used are technologies not allowed in F1 such as active aerodynamics and traction control. After a downforce of 7600N (1700lbf) is reached at [...] the rear wing <b>is</b> <b>actuated</b> by computer to maintain that downforce.|$|E
2500|$|A {{miniature}} snap-action switch, also trademarked {{and frequently}} {{known as a}} micro switch, is an electric switch that <b>is</b> <b>actuated</b> by very little physical force, {{through the use of}} a tipping-point mechanism, sometimes called an [...] "over-center" [...] mechanism. Common applications of micro switches include the door interlock on a microwave oven, levelling and safety switches in elevators, vending machines, and to detect paper jams or other faults in photocopiers. The miniature snap-action switch was invented in 1932 by Peter McGall, who was an employee of the Burgess Battery Company in Freeport, Illinois.|$|E
2500|$|The second {{constraint}} of {{the differential}} is passive—it <b>is</b> <b>actuated</b> by the friction kinematics chain through the ground. The difference in torque on the roadwheels and tires (caused by turns or bumpy ground) drives the second degree of freedom, (overcoming the torque of inner friction) to equalise the driving torque on the tires. The {{sensitivity of the}} differential depends on the inner friction through the second degree of freedom. All of the differentials (so called [...] "active" [...] and [...] "passive") use clutches and brakes for restricting the second degree of freedom, so all suffer from the same disadvantage—decreased sensitivity to a dynamically changing environment. The sensitivity of the ECU controlled differential is also limited by the time delay caused by sensors and the response time of the actuators.|$|E
50|$|Ionic EAPs are {{polymers}} {{that can}} <b>be</b> <b>actuated</b> through {{the diffusion of}} ions in an electrolyte solution (in addition to the application of electric fields). Current examples of ionic electroactive polymers include polyelectrode gels, ionomeric polymer metallic composites (IPMC), conductive polymers and electrorheological fluids (ERF). In 2011, it was demonstrated that twisted carbon nanotubes could also <b>be</b> <b>actuated</b> by applying an electric field.|$|R

2500|$|Current {{systems have}} gears {{incorporated}} in the crankset or bottom bracket. Patents for such systems appeared as early as 1890. The Schlumpf Mountain Drive and Speed Drive have been available since 2001. [...] Some systems offer direct drive plus one of three variants (reduction 1:2.5, increase 1.65:1, and increase 2.5:1). Changing gears is accomplished by using your foot to tap a button protruding {{on each side of}} the bottom bracket spindle. The effect is that of having a bicycle with twin chainrings with a massive difference in sizes. Pinion GmbH introduced in 2010 an 18 speed gearbox model, offering an evenly spaced 636% range. This gearbox <b>is</b> <b>actuated</b> by traditional twist shifter and uses two cables for gear changing. The Pinion system is well suited for mountain bicycles due to its wide range and low gravity center suitable for full-suspension bikes, but it is still somewhat heavier than derailleur-based drivetrain.|$|E
2500|$|The actual {{engraving}} {{is traditionally}} {{done by a}} combination of pressure and manipulating the work-piece. The traditional [...] "hand push" [...] process is still practiced today, but modern technology has brought various mechanically assisted engraving systems. Most pneumatic engraving systems require an air source that drives air through a hose into a handpiece, which resembles a traditional engraving handle in many cases, that powers a mechanism (usually a piston). The air <b>is</b> <b>actuated</b> by either a foot control (like a gas pedal or sewing machine) or newer palm / hand control. This mechanism replaces either the [...] "hand push" [...] effort or the effects of a hammer. The internal mechanisms move at speeds up to 15,000 strokes per minute, thereby greatly reducing the effort needed in traditional hand engraving. These types of pneumatic systems are used for power assistance only and do not guide or control the engraving artist. One of the major benefits of using a pneumatic system for hand engraving is the reduction of fatigue and decrease in time spent working.|$|E
2500|$|Glock pistols are {{designed}} with three independent safety mechanisms to prevent accidental discharge. The system, designated [...] "Safe Action" [...] by Glock, consists of an external integrated trigger safety and two automatic internal safeties: a firing pin safety, and a drop safety. The external safety is a small inner lever contained in the trigger. Pressing the lever activates the trigger bar and sheet metal connector. The firing pin safety is a solid hardened steel pin that, in the secured state, blocks the firing pin channel (disabling the firing pin in its longitudinal axis). It is pushed upward to release the firing pin for firing only when the trigger <b>is</b> <b>actuated</b> and the safety is pushed up through the backward movement of the trigger bar. The drop safety guides the trigger bar in a ramp that is released only when direct rearward pressure {{is applied to the}} trigger. The three safety mechanisms are automatically disengaged one after the other when the trigger is squeezed, and are automatically reactivated when the trigger is released. This passive safety system omits the manipulation of traditional on-off levers, hammers, or other external safeties as found in many other handgun designs. The ability to fire immediately, without worrying about an external safety, is one feature Glock has stressed as an advantage when selling its guns, especially to police departments.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} determining the singularity loci of 3 -DOF planar parallel manipulators with revolute joints for a constant orientation of the mobile platform. The case when the base joints <b>are</b> <b>actuated</b> <b>is</b> of primary concern and is proved here to lead to singularity loci represented by curves of degree 42 —an improved measure {{with respect to the}} one already given in the literature. A particular case is studied when two of the platform joints are coincident which allows the singularities to be studied geometrically. The case when the intermediate joints <b>are</b> <b>actuated</b> <b>is</b> also considered. On the basis of the presented study, important observations are made {{on the nature of the}} singularity loci for both types of actuation. ...|$|R
