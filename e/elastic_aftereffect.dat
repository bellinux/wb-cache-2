40|$|Production of {{investment}} patterns for precision casting by molding of powders based on waxy materials {{makes it possible}} to improve dimensional and geometric properties of castings mainly at the expense of shrinkage defect elimination. However, during the formation of compact massive elements the pattern material relaxes elastically after load removal. In addition, non-uniform density distribution in dif-ferent parts of the compacts is observed in a number of cases. The necessity of finding the optimal re-gimes of compact formation with minimal anisotropy, and therefore minimal value of <b>elastic</b> <b>aftereffect</b> of compacted porous body after load removal determines the relevance of this study. In this paper we intro-duce experimental determination of one variant of powder body compaction and subsequent elastic after-effect due to load removal. Investigated powder body consists of single-component polymeric material. In accordance with the results of the experiments the dependence of material temperature in contact area between the die and the mold on compacting pressure was obtained. It was experimentally determined the influence of thermophysical properties of powder body compaction process on shrinkage formation and <b>elastic</b> <b>aftereffect</b> of compact material...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Compressive {{stress-strain}} {{loops of}} selected polymers at strain rates up to nearly 800 /s are determined in a strain range of nearly 8 % {{on the standard}} split Hopkinson pressure bar. Four different commercially available extruded polymers are tested at room temperature. The compressive stress-strain loops at low and intermediate strain rates are measured on an Instron testing machine. The effects of strain rate on the Young's modulus, flow stress and dissipation energy are discussed. It is shown that the area included within the stress-strain loop increases with increasing strain rate {{as well as a}} given strain, that is, all four extruded polymers tested exhibit intrinsic strain-rate dependent viscoelastic behavior and a high <b>elastic</b> <b>aftereffect</b> following complete unloading...|$|E
40|$|There the {{purposes}} are the analyse by experiment the section rolling process of composition {{materials in the}} closed pass, to develop the new rolling scheme of high-dense composition section. The mechanisms of <b>elastic</b> <b>aftereffect</b> condition at the rolling of powder material in the closed pass without the breadth have been brought out. The design procedure of deformation indicators has been developed. The expansion possibility of shape factor of deformation place {{in the field of}} small values has been ascertained. The manner and the devices for the production of high-dense powder sections by the rolling as well as the production process of end plate of rotor-piston engine have been developed. The application fields are the machinery industry, the engine building, the section rollingAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
30|$|The second {{hypothesis}} {{may also be}} suggested stating the influence of processing mode parameters on shrinkage. <b>Elastic</b> rheonomic <b>aftereffect</b> of the material and reduction of the diameter of holes depends on the forces acting during cutting. The greater the forces acting during drilling are, the higher elastic deformation after removal of stresses and reaction forces they cause as the Ostrosablin (1984) and, therefore, the larger the shrinkage is and the smaller the hole diameter after processing becomes. That is, {{the effect of the}} ‘shape memory’ of the hole will be observed after temporary application of force and temperature fields, and the larger they are, the bigger the shrinkage of the hole is.|$|R
