50|$|The {{history of}} the school {{can be traced back}} to the 19th century but the present site was {{established}} in 1952 with the creation of The <b>Headlands</b> Grammar School which later became The <b>Headlands</b> Comprehensive School.

5|$|The Old Man is {{probably}} less than 250 years old, and may soon collapse. The stack is {{not mentioned in}} the Orkneyinga saga, written 1230, and on the Blaeu map of 1600, a <b>headland</b> exists {{at the point where the}} Old Man is now. The McKenzie map of Hoy of 1750 similarly shows a <b>headland</b> but no stack, but by 1819 the Old Man had been separated from the mainland. William Daniell sketched the sea stack at this time as a wider column with a smaller top section and an arch at the base, from which it derived its name.|$|E

5|$|The first {{sighting}} of an ocean {{passage to the}} Pacific south of Tierra del Fuego is sometimes attributed to Francisco de Hoces of the Loaisa Expedition. In January 1526 his ship San Lesmes was blown south from the Atlantic entrance of the Magellan Strait {{to a point where}} the crew thought they saw a <b>headland,</b> and water beyond it, which indicated the southern extremity of the continent. It is speculation as to which <b>headland</b> they saw; conceivably it was Cape Horn. In parts of the Spanish-speaking world it is believed that de Hoces may have discovered the strait later known as the Drake Passage more than 50years before Sir Francis Drake, the British privateer.|$|E
5|$|The <b>headland</b> is {{primarily}} covered with grass, {{as well as}} heather (Calluna vulgaris), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), thyme (Thymus polytrichus) and western gorse (Ulex gallii). In 1962, specimens of the comparatively rare western clover (Trifolium occidentale) were found on Zennor Head. The lichen Dirina massiliensis has also been found high on the acid schist cliffs on the north-, seaward-side of the <b>headland.</b> The parasitic plant dodder (Cuscuta epithymum) is found growing on gorse. There are also typical coastal flowering plants such as kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), sea campion (Silene uniflora), and thrift (Armeria maritima).|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the Warren Hill would have {{overlooked}} a large river valley that was to become the English Channel. Once the sea had inundated the surrounding valley, Mesolithic hunter gatherers exploited the site. Pollen analysis of peat from the Solent bed suggest a lightly wooded <b>headland</b> free of close-knit undergrowth during this period, an ideal habitat for game.|$|E
50|$|The <b>headlands</b> {{themselves}} are rocky bluffs overlooking the Pacific Ocean, surrounding Mendocino. The section of <b>headlands</b> {{along the south}} side of Main Street in Mendocino is narrow and covered by blackberry and rose brambles.

5|$|Brean Down Fort {{was built}} on the <b>headland</b> between 1864 and 1871 on the {{recommendations}} of the 1859 Royal Commission. It was the most southerly of a chain of defences across the Bristol Channel, protecting the access to Bristol and Cardiff. Four acres of land at the end of Brean Down were requisitioned in 1862, with construction beginning in 1864 and completed in 1871.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the fleet}} crossed to Thasos, {{resulting}} in the Thasians submitting to the Persians. The fleet then rounded the coastline as far as Acanthus in Chalcidice, before attempting to round the <b>headland</b> of Mount Athos. However, they were caught in a violent storm, which drove them against the coastline of Athos, wrecking (according to Herodotus) 300 ships, {{with the loss of}} 20,000 men.|$|E

At {{the top of the}} site is the entrance to the castle, the high-level gun batteries and the 16th-century Henrician Castle; the terraced site slopes down to the water, where gun batteries and the 16th-century blockhouse look out across the water.|$|E
5|$|The <b>headland</b> is {{bordered by}} Cornish granite hedges, and {{the farming system}} dates from about 4000 BC, {{the time of the}} Bronze Age in Cornwall. The {{surrounding}} area and village of Zennor has been continually occupied for over 4,000 years. Zennor Head was mined extensively for copper and tin in the 19th century, and drainage adits remain visible on the eastern side.|$|E
5|$|The {{promontory}} was {{donated to}} the National Trust in December 1953. The Southwest Coast Path was created in 1978, and runs {{along the top of}} Zennor Head as part of its , following the edge of the cliffs closely. Zennor in Darkness, the 1994 McKitterick Prize-winning novel by Helen Dunmore, was partly set around Zennor Head. In 2009 the <b>headland</b> suffered flooding which affected the cliff-top footpath.|$|E

50|$|The {{program at}} the Marin <b>Headlands</b> for Mission blue {{butterfly}} habitat protection aims to deal {{with one of the}} main problems facing the Mission blue butterfly population. The <b>Headlands</b> area was once owned by the U.S. Army. From 1870 on, the Army used the area for forts such as Fort Cronkhite, coastal batteries such as those that protected the San Francisco Bay during WW II, and missile sites, such as the 280 that occupied the area during the Cold War. While in the Marin <b>Headlands,</b> the Army planted a lot of trees, so many that today the non-native, invasive species that occupy the <b>Headlands</b> threaten the habitat of the Mission blue butterfly. The habitat protection program seeks to root out these species from selected areas of the Marin <b>Headlands.</b> Some of the species that have now become native to the area and threaten the habitat of the endangered Mission blue butterfly include blue gum eucalyptus, Monterey cypress, Monterey pine and blackwood acacia. The Mission Blue Butterfly UserFee Project in the <b>headlands</b> will try to remove these species and revegetate the area with native coastal prairie plants.|$|R
5|$|The {{terrain of}} a barrier island is {{determined}} by a dynamic beach system with offshore bars, pounding surf, and shifting beaches; as well as grassy dunes behind the beach, maritime forests with wetlands in the interiors, and salt or tidal marshes on the lee side, facing the mainland. A typical barrier island has a <b>headland,</b> a beach and surf zone, and a sand spit.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole of}} the {{building}} known as the Priory of St Mary, Lihou and surrounding area was listed as a Protected Monument on 26 March 1938, reference PM236. From 1 March 2006, Lihou and the L'Erée <b>headland</b> were designated a part of Guernsey's first Ramsar wetland site.|$|E
5|$|After {{following}} the river back through Durgan {{to the open}} waters beyond Toll Point, the path skirts Falmouth Bay along Maenporth, Swanpool and Gyllyngvase beaches before passing around the <b>headland</b> beneath Pendennis Castle to enter bustling Falmouth. The castle was built, along with its twin at St Mawes, to protect the deep water of Carrick Roads from attack. This natural haven is what made Falmouth such an important harbour, it being the last good shelter for ships heading westwards towards the Atlantic Ocean.|$|E
