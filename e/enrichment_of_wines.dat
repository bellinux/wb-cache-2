40|$|The {{immobilization}} of enzymes has {{not been}} reported earlier on the two-dimensional crystalline bacterial cell surface (S-layer). In this study we tested S-layer isolated from Bacillus stearothermophilus PV 72 for enzyme (ß-glucosidase, hexokinase and aldolase) immobilization. The carbodiimide method gave yields less than 5 %. The yields of co-cross-linking method with glutaraldehyde were enhanced compared to the carbodiimide method, but the yield was higher than 10 % only {{in the case of}} ß-glucosidase. Because of the fine structure of S-layer, immobilized enzymes could be removed from reaction mixtures only by centrifugation, therefore these preparations were entrapped in calcium alginate gel. The yields of entrapping procedures were between 15 % and 37 %. It was presumed that the new immobilized ß-glucosidase preparation could be used in a preliminary testing for flavour <b>enrichment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wines.</b> Efficiency of this preparation was compared to that of the immobilized ß-glucosidase on Acrylex C- 100 support described earlier. We found that the immobilization of ß-glucosidase on both Acrylex C- 100 support and S-layer followed by gel entrapping resulted in active enzyme preparations {{that could be used for}} flavour <b>enrichment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wines</b> without enhancing their protein content...|$|E
40|$|This PhD thesis {{has been}} {{proposed}} to validate and then apply innovative analytical methodologies for the determination of compounds with harmful impact on human health, such as biogenic amines and ochratoxin A in wines. Therefore, the influence of production technology (pH, amino acids precursor and use of different malolactic starters) on biogenic amines content in wines was evaluated. An HPLC method for simultaneous determination of amino acids and amines with precolumnderivatization with 9 -Fluorenyl-methoxycarbonyl chloride (FMOC-Cl) and UV detection was developed. Initially, the influence of pH, time of derivatization, gradient profile were studied. In order to improve the separation of amino acids and amines and reduce the time of analysis, {{it was decided to}} study the influence of different flows and the use of different columns in the chromatographic method. Firstly, a C 18 Luna column was used and later two monolithic columns Chromolith in series. It appeared to be suitable for an easy, precise and accurate determination of a relatively large number of amino acids and amines in wines. This method was then applied on different wines produced in the Emilia Romagna region. The investigation permitted to discriminate between red and white wines. Amino acids content is related to the winemaking process. Biogenic amines content in these wines does not represent a possible toxicological problem for human health. The results of the study of influence of technologies and wine composition demonstrated that pH of wines and amino acids content are the most important factors. Particularly wines with pH > 3, 5 show higher concentration of biogenic amines than wines with lower pH. The <b>enrichment</b> <b>of</b> <b>wines</b> by nutrients also influences the content of some biogenic amines that are higher in wines added with amino acids precursors. In this study, amino acids and biogenic amines are not statistically affected by strain of lactic acid bacteria inoculated as a starter for malolactic fermentation. An evaluation of different clean-up (SPE-MycoSep; IACs and LLE) and determination methods (HPLC and ELISA) of ochratoxin A was carried out. The results obtained proved that the SPE clean-up are reliable at the same level while the LLE procedures shows lowest recovery. The ELISA method gave a lower determination and a low reproducibility than HPLC method...|$|E

40|$|Oxygen plays {{a crucial}} role in oenology. The oxygen leads to changes in the {{chemical}} and sensory profile <b>of</b> <b>wines.</b> On one hand, the impact of moderate oxygen exposure <b>of</b> red <b>wine</b> has a positive effect in its colour, aromatic bouquet and mouth-feel properties. On the other hand, oxygen has a negative effect on white wine’s quality, as well as the sensory and compositional levels. The {{purpose of this study was}} to quantify the dissolved oxygen in red and white wine, during different cellar operations such as racking, tartaric stabilization, filtering and bottling. The techniques that contribute most to the <b>enrichment</b> <b>of</b> oxygen in <b>wine</b> are: cold tartaric stabilization (2. 29 mg/L, white wines), bottling (1. 38 mg/L red wines and 1. 11 mg/L white wines) and bag-in-box filling (2. 47 mg/L red wines; 2. 22 mg/L white wines).

40|$|Two {{different}} yeast {{cell wall}} extracts were obtained using enzymatic digestion and thermal treatment. The effects of the extracts obtained on the foaming properties <b>of</b> a model <b>wine</b> and two sparkling wines were studied. The model wine and sparkling wines, supplemented with the thermal extract, presented better foaming properties than did the samples supplemented with the enzymatic extract. The fractioning (Con A chromatography) and characterization (SDS-PAGE, SEC, GC, and RP-HPLC) of both extracts showed that the fraction responsible for the foaming properties is constituted by mannoproteins with a relative molecular weight between 10 and 30 kDa, presenting an equilibrated composition of the hydrophobic and hydrophilic protein domains. This thermal extract did not modify the protein stability in both the model wine and the sparkling wines.

30|$|The {{electrical}} conductivity at 25  °C ranges from 1380 to 14, 830  µS/cm {{with an average}} of 5557.76  µS/cm. The factors responsible for large variation in EC are attributed to geochemical processes such as ionic exchange, reverse exchange, evaporation, silicate weathering, rock–water interaction, sulphate reduction and oxidation processes and anthropogenic activities (Ramesh and Elango 2012). Rao et al. (2002) classified EC as type I, if the <b>enrichments</b> <b>of</b> salts are low (EC <  1500  μS/cm); type II, if the <b>enrichment</b> <b>of</b> salts are medium (EC: 1500 and 3000  μS/cm); and type III, if the <b>enrichments</b> <b>of</b> salts are high (EC >  3000  μS/cm), (Prasanth et al. 2012). According to the above classification of EC, the entire groundwater samples come under the type III (high <b>enrichment</b> <b>of</b> salts) except well 42 under type II (medium <b>enrichment</b> <b>of</b> salts). High EC in the study area indicates the high <b>enrichment</b> <b>of</b> salts in the groundwater.

30|$|Electrical {{conductivity}} (EC) is {{a measure}} of an ability to conduct current and higher EC indicates the <b>enrichment</b> <b>of</b> salts/dissolved matter in the groundwater. The EC values ranged from 29.3 to 1775  μS/cm, with a mean of 163.64  μS/cm. The water can be classified based on EC as type I, if the <b>enrichments</b> <b>of</b> salts are low (EC: < 1500  μS/cm); type II, if the <b>enrichment</b> <b>of</b> salts are medium (EC: 1500 and 3000  μS/cm); and type III, if the <b>enrichments</b> <b>of</b> salts are high (EC: > 3000  μS/cm) (Subba Rao et al. 2012).

30|$|Electrical {{conductivity}} is {{a measure}} of water capacity to convey the electrical current. The most desirable limit of EC in drinking water is prescribed as 1, 500  μS/cm. The value of EC is between 580 and 7, 250  μS/cm. EC measures the ability of a material to conduct an electric current such that the higher EC indicates <b>enrichment</b> <b>of</b> salts in the groundwater. Thus, the EC can be classified as type I, if the <b>enrichments</b> <b>of</b> salts are low (EC <  1, 500  μS/cm); type II, if the <b>enrichment</b> <b>of</b> salts are medium (EC: 1, 500 and 3, 000  μS/cm); and type III, if the <b>enrichments</b> <b>of</b> salts are high (EC >  3, 000  μS/cm; Sarath Prasanth et al. 2012).

30|$|Electrical {{conductivity}} is {{a measure}} of water capacity to convey electric current. The most desirable limit of EC in drinking water is prescribed as 1, 500  μmhos/cm (WHO 2004). The EC of the groundwater is varying from 64.02 and 2199.57  μmhos/cm with an average value of 514  μmhos/cm (Fig.  3 b). Higher EC in the study area indicates the <b>enrichment</b> <b>of</b> salts in the groundwater. The value of electrical conductivity may be an approximate index of the total content of dissolved substance in water. It depends upon temperature, concentration and types of ions present (Hem 1985). The EC can be classified as type I, if the <b>enrichments</b> <b>of</b> salts are low (EC <  1, 500  μmhos/cm); type II, if the <b>enrichment</b> <b>of</b> salts are medium (EC 1, 500 and 3, 000  μmhos/cm); and type III, if the <b>enrichments</b> <b>of</b> salts are high (EC >  3, 000  μmhos/cm). According to the above classification of EC, 96  % of the total groundwater samples come under the type I (low <b>enrichment</b> <b>of</b> salts) and 4  % under type II (medium <b>enrichment</b> <b>of</b> salts). The effect of saline intrusion may be the reason for medium <b>enrichment</b> <b>of</b> EC in the study area. The effect of pH may also increase the dissolution process, which eventually increases the EC value.|$|R
