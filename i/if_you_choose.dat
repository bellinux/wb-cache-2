NBC reported losing $500,000 in advertising revenue. Speaking of this loss, then-NBC president Warren Littlefield said, at odds with NBC's earlier denial of possible revenue loss being a factor in its scheduling decision, [...] "There are few things in broadcasting that we know for sure, {{and one of those}} is that when you do an episode of any series that deals with AIDS, {{there is going to be}} advertiser sensitivity to it.

But if you want to play against the best, we have to train on a daily basis." [...] After pondering this lifetime decision for two days, Nowitzki agreed to enter the full-time training schedule, choosing the path to his eventual international career. Geschwindner let him train seven days a week with DJK Würzburg players and future German internationals Robert Garrett, Marvin Willoughby, and Demond Greene, and in the summer of 1994, then 16-year-old Nowitzki made the DJK squad.|$|E
