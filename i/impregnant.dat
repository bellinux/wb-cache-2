40|$|It {{is known}} that water {{absorption}} {{from the surface of}} concrete is involved in much of the deterioration of concrete structures, such as in spalling and damage by alkali-aggregate reaction or salt damage. It is also becoming clear that controlling concrete surface water absorption can significantly improve such deterioration and damage. 1) 2) Controlling concrete surface water absorption could thus lead to higher durability of concrete structures. One method to achieve that is surface treatment by applying concrete surfaces with surface <b>impregnant.</b> The Recommendation for Concrete Repair and Surface Protection of Concrete Structures (draft) 3) was thus established in 2005, and surface <b>impregnant</b> has been attracting more interest. Researchers have pointed out that impregnation depth and anti-absorption effect of surface <b>impregnant</b> may depend on moisture status of concrete at applying <b>impregnant.</b> 3) 4) Application methods might greatly affect performance; thus, appropriate specifications should be set down.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{tungsten}} erosion, transport and redeposition on {{the operation of}} dispenser hollow cathodes was investigated in detailed examinations of the discharge cathode inserts from an 8200 hour and a 30, 352 hour ion engine wear test. Erosion and subsequent re-deposition of tungsten in the electron emission zone at the downstream end of the insert reduces the porosity of the tungsten matrix, preventing the flow of barium from the interior. This inhibits the interfacial reactions of the barium-calcium-aluminate <b>impregnant</b> with the tungsten in the pores. A numerical model of barium transport in the internal xenon discharge plasma shows that the barium required to reduce the work function in the emission zone can be supplied from upstream through the gas phase. Barium that flows out of the pores of the tungsten insert is rapidly ionized in the xenon discharge and pushedback to the emitter surface by the electric field and drag from the xenon ion flow. Thisbarium ion flux is sufficient to maintain a barium surface coverage at the downstream endgreater than 0. 6, even if local barium production at that point is inhibited by tungsten deposits. The model also shows that the neutral barium pressure exceeds the equilibrium vapor pressure of the <b>impregnant</b> decomposition reaction {{over much of the}} insert length,so the reactions are suppressed. Only a small region upstream of the zone blocked by tungsten deposits is active and supplies the required barium.
