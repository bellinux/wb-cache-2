The coefficients of the effective theory satisfy a set of renormalization group equations {{that can be used}} to sum up leading and subleading logarithms of T/gT. We use the solutions to these equations to obtain a result for the free energy which is correct to order g^ 8 (g). Finally, we investigate the convergence of the perturbative series. Comment: 29 pages and 12 figs. New version: we have pushed the calculations to g^ 8 *log(g) using the renormalization group to sum up log(g) from higher orders. Published in JHE...|$|R
40|$|The {{successive}} perturbative {{estimates of}} the pressure of QCD at high temperature T show no sign of convergence, unless the coupling constant g is unrealistically small. Exploiting known results of an effective field theory which separates hard (order 2 pi T) and soft (<b>order</b> <b>gT)</b> contributions, we explore the accuracy of simple resummations which at a given loop order systematically treat hard contributions strictly perturbatively, but soft contributions without truncations. This turns out to improve significantly the two-loop and the three-loop results in that both remain below the ideal-gas value, {{and the degree of}} renormalization scale dependence decreases as one goes from two to three loop order, whereas it increases in the conventional perturbative results. Including the four-loop logarithms recently obtained by Kajantie et al., we find that this trend continues and that with a particular sublogarithmic constant the untruncated four-loop result is close to the three-loop result, which itself agrees well with available lattice results down to temperatures of about 2. 5 T_c. We also investigate the possibility of optimization by using a variational (``screened'') perturbation theory in the effective theory. At two loops, this gives a result below the ideal gas value, and also closer to lattice results than the recent two-loop hard-thermal-loop-screened result of Andersen et al. While at three-loop order the gap equation of dimensionally reduced screened perturbation theory does not have a solution in QCD, this is remedied upon inclusion of the four-loop logarithms.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} {{study was to examine}} the correlation between the alternative gifted selection criteria (e. g., Pathways, Gateways, and Multiple Assessment Combinations) used in six counties in North Carolina for the placement of selected Non-White populations into the gifted and talented (<b>GT)</b> program, in <b>order</b> to identify whether alternative gifted selection criteria were correlated. A correlation design was used in this quantitative research study based on the examination of ex post facto data. The paradigm for this study was pragmatism, as developed by Dewey (1938; 1964), in which it is held that truth is tested by consequences and beliefs (Creswell, 2006). The selected ethnic populations were African American, Native American, and Hispanic. Six counties in North Carolina were identified through a stratified sampling method. In these counties, there were active GT programs in the elementary schools, where varying traditional and alternative gifted selection criteria were used. The selected counties were located in the northern, southern, eastern, and western regions of North Carolina. The alternative gifted selection criteria was reviewed and analyzed. Statistical data and alternative gifted criteria were collected at the county/district and state levels. Pearson Chi-Square statistics were performed using the Microsoft Office Excel program. The statistical analysis results indicated that the observed differences in how African American students were placed into Academically and Intellectually Gifted (AIG) programs (Pathways, Gateways, and Multiple Assessment Combinations) could be related to the ethnicity of the students. Whereas, the results indicated that the observed differences in how Native American and Hispanic students were placed into AIG programs (Pathways, Gateways, and Multiple Assessment Combinations) could not be related to the ethnicity of the students...|$|R
