25|$|Kin selection. That {{animals and}} humans are more altruistic towards close kin than to distant kin and non-kin has been {{confirmed}} in numerous studies across many different cultures. Even subtle cues indicating kinship may unconsciously increase altruistic behavior. One kinship cue is facial resemblance. One study found that slightly altering photographs so that they more closely resembled the faces of study participants increased the trust the participants expressed regarding depicted persons. Another cue <b>is</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> same family name, especially if rare, {{and this has been}} found to increase helpful behavior. Another study found more cooperative behavior the greater the number of perceived kin in a group. Using kinship terms in political speeches increased audience agreement with the speaker in one study.

Black and white usually denotes that the scene involves {{one or more of}} the hustlers engaged with a client, and indicates that {{one or more of the}} characters (not necessarily the client) is fantasizing.

Equally, Harry's fantasies about [...] "Lovely Girl" [...] (who is apparently dead) are occasionally in color.

McCown-Levy also felt [...] "the show <b>is</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> most narratively efficient season yet, effectively balancing mission-of-the-week adventures with the longer plots", but was critical of Lucy and the low stokes of the villains. Terri Schwartz at IGN scored the episode an eight out of ten, indicating a [...] "great" [...] episode, and said the highlight was the action and choreography. Schwartz also noted character-focused moments such as the Johnson and May heart-to-heart and the revelations about Mace, while highliy criticizing the ghost effects, saying, [...] "Maybe it's Lucy's makeup or maybe it's the downside of having a TV show budget, but the look of these affected beings takes me out of the episode whenever they appear.

500|$|Opinions {{about the}} song have been mixed. AllMusic critic Thomas Ward calls it [...] "one {{of the great}} good-time songs in Dylan's canon". Ward {{comments}} that [...] "Dylan sings it as if he <b>is</b> <b>having</b> <b>the</b> time of his life", adding that [...] "rarely has he sung with such expressiveness". Anthony Varesi, author of The Bob Dylan Albums, similarly praises the song's [...] "breadth of feeling" [...] and [...] "unparalleled expressiveness", noting that [...] "it appears Dylan simply improvised the song on the spot, and the passion within him allows the song to flow forth naturally". Biographer John Nagowski has described the song as [...] "delightful", while a New York Times review rates {{it one of the}} highlights of Volume 2 of The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3, commenting that it is one of only a couple of mid-60s songs on the compilation that [...] "live up to their vintage". Griffin describes it as [...] "catchy but slight" [...] and [...] "a slight if charming little ditty", but criticizes the decision to include it on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 rather than the [...] "masterpiece" [...] composition [...] "Sign on the Cross". Heylin concurs, characterizing [...] "Santa-Fe" [...] in 1995 as a [...] "pleasant enough throwaway" [...] but suggesting that [...] "Sign on the Cross" [...] or another 1967 composition, [...] "I'm Not There", would have been much better choices ("I'm Not There" [...] was eventually released in 2007 on the I'm Not There soundtrack, and both it and [...] "Sign on the Cross" [...] were included on The Basement Tapes Raw and The Basement Tapes Complete in 2014). By 2009, Heylin's opinion had changed little and he writes that [...] "of all the 'missing' basement-tape originals that appear on that three-CD set, 'Santa Fe' hardly represented an A-list candidate. Just another discarded ditty, it relies on the usual wordplay and slurred diction to obscure any pretense to a deeper meaning". Marcus dismisses it as no more than [...] "a riff", while a review in Stereophile magazine calls it [...] "the most lightweight tune on all three CDs, with indecipherable lyrics". Author Peter James, referring to Dylan and the Band's Woodstock output, writes that [...] "many great songs were written and recorded in [...] basement in 1967, unfortunately 'Sante-Fe' is not one of them." [...] He goes on to describe the song's inclusion on The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3 as [...] "little more than a joke".|$|E

[...] Cernat proposes: [...] "Just like in the works of his junior Sorin Stoica and those of a few others, one senses in these minute 'stories of life' the pleasure of collecting 'mentality samples'." [...] Some of the book's characters have to deal with circumstances that test their limits: in Buldozeristul, the protagonist uses his machine to bury his wife and daughter after failing to speed up procedures for a proper funeral; an old age pensioner who seduces women while queuing for gas cylinder refills; and, in the eponymous writing, a teenager who is publicly humiliated by having his hands and arms covered in spit.|$|E
