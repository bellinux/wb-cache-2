25|$|Generally, the disseisor's openly <b>hostile</b> <b>possession</b> must be continual (although not {{necessarily}} constant) without challenge or {{permission from the}} lawful owner, but breaks in use {{that are consistent with}} how an owner would use the property will not prevent an adverse possession claim. Occasional activity on the land with long gaps in activity fail the test of continuous possession; courts have ruled that merely cutting timber at intervals, when not accompanied by other actions that demonstrate actual and continuous possession, fails to demonstrate continuous possession. If {{at any time during the}} statute of limitations period, the true owner ejects the disseisor from the land either verbally or through legal action, and the disseisor then returns and dispossesses him again, then the statute of limitations period begins anew.|$|E
5000|$|The {{adverse party}} {{is called the}} {{disseisor}}, meaning one who dispossesses the true owner of the property. The disseisor must openly occupy the property exclusively, keep out others, {{and use it as}} if it were his own. Some jurisdictions permit accidental adverse possession as might occur with a surveying error. Generally, the openly <b>hostile</b> <b>possession</b> must be continual (although not necessarily continuous or constant) without challenge or permission from the lawful owner, for a fixed statutory period to acquire title. Where the property is of a type ordinarily occupied only during certain times (such as a summer cottage), the disseisor may need to have only exclusive, open, and <b>hostile</b> <b>possession</b> during those successive useful periods, making the same use of the property as an owner would for the required number of years. Adverse possession requires at a minimum five basic conditions being met to perfect the title of the disseisor. These are: ...|$|E
5000|$|Reports of piracy did not resurge in the Mediterranean {{until after}} Alexander the Great's death in 323 BC. He had set a {{precedent}} for an intentional effort to curb piracy during his conquests around the Mediterranean rim. In his De Civitate Dei, St. Augustine recounts an entertaining exchange between Alexander and pirate that he had captured:For when that king had asked the man {{what he meant by}} keeping <b>hostile</b> <b>possession</b> of the sea, he answered with bold pride, [...] "What do thou meanest by seizing the whole earth? because I do it with a petty ship, I am called a robber, whilst thou who dost it with a great fleet art styled emperor." ...|$|E
60|$|Sicily, {{as will be}} seen by {{referring}} to the map, is of a triangular form. It was only the southern portion which was {{at this time in}} the hands of the Sicilians. There were two foreign and <b>hostile</b> powers in <b>possession,</b> respectively, of the northeastern and northwestern portions. In the northeastern corner of the island was the city of Messana--the Messina of modern days. In the time of Pyrrhus's expedition, Messana was the seat and stronghold of a warlike nation, called the Mamertines, who had come over from Italy across the Straits of Messana some years before, and, having made themselves masters of that portion of the island, had since held their ground there, notwithstanding all the efforts of the Sicilians to expel them. The Mamertines had originally come into Sicily, it was said, as Pyrrhus had gone into Italy--by invitation. Agathocles sent for them to come and aid him in some of his wars. After the object for which they had been sent for had been accomplished, Agathocles dismissed his auxiliaries, and they set out on their return. They proceeded through the northeastern part of the island to Messana, where they were to embark for Italy. Though they had rendered Agathocles very efficient aid in his campaigns, they had also occasioned him an infinite deal of trouble by their turbulent and ungovernable spirit; and now, as they were withdrawing from the island, the inhabitants of the country through which they passed on the way regarded them every where with terror and dread. The people of Messana, anxious to avoid a quarrel with them, and disposed to facilitate their peaceable departure from the land by every means in their power, received them into the city, and hospitably entertained them there. Instead, however, of quietly withdrawing from the city in proper time, as the Messanians had expected them to do, they rose suddenly and unexpectedly upon the people, at a concerted signal, took possession of the city, massacred without mercy all the men, seized the women and children, and then, each one establishing himself in the household that choice or chance assigned him, married the wife and adopted the children whose husband and father he had murdered. The result was the most complete and extraordinary overturning that the history of the world can afford. It was a political, a social, and a domestic revolution all in one.|$|R
