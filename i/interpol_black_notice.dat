500|$|That night, {{another couple}} is brutally {{killed on the}} highway. Black and Watts investigate, but they deem the deaths unconnected. However, <b>Black</b> <b>notices</b> that the newest murders are {{identical}} to the prior crimes of [...] "Bear", one of the inmates involved in the previous day's fight. Stoller is adamant Bear cannot be responsible—until she finds the victim's hand in the cafeteria's stew. Bear insists someone took something [...] "from inside" [...] him, but has a seizure before he can explain. Between this incident and Woodcock insisting that Edward (Justin Louis) has stolen his dreams, Black realizes someone in the hospital is causing the deaths.|$|R
50|$|Following {{the death}} of Diane Bray and an {{apparent}} attack on Kay Scarpetta by Jean-Baptiste Chandonne in her own house {{at the end of}} <b>Black</b> <b>Notice,</b> The Last Precinct concentrates on discovering the full story behind Chandonne's killings. Kay Scarpetta is also under suspicion for the killing of Bray, due to their known rivalry and public confrontations. Torn between a desire to clear her name and the instinct of a wounded animal to turn against even its would-be rescuers, Kay sifts through the forensic evidence that seems to link Chandonne to past events in her life, up to and including the murder of her lover, Benton Wesley. A major new character is Jaime Berger, from the District Attorney's Office in New York, who believes Chandonne killed a woman in New York two years' before his arrival in Virginia. Kay must examine her own fears, misconceptions, and anything-but-altruistic motives to accept working with another competent woman.|$|R

5|$|The Millennium Group, {{a private}} investigative group, dispatches {{profiler}} Frank Black (Lance Henriksen) to the scene, where he meets Seattle detective Bob Bletcher (Bill Smitrovich). Black finds the house's alarm system, noticing {{that it did}} not go off until the killer left the house.

50|$|Lucy {{is first}} {{introduced}} in Postmortem as a precocious 10 - year - old, {{the only child}} of Kay's sister Dorothy, who is presented as flighty, irresponsible, and narcissistic, the last of which is common to Scarpetta. Lucy has a natural aptitude for computers and easily learns UNIX, which she later uses while working for the FBI. She looks to her Aunt Kay for stability and understanding, and although she is frequently sulky in her adolescence, she shapes herself into a very strong woman with Kay's model to follow. She enters the FBI at 18, but is not well accepted due to her suspected sexual orientation and her genius IQ. Lucy has a habit of establishing long-term romantic relationships which last a few books and then end with little explanation. For example, Jo is last seen taken home (in <b>Black</b> <b>Notice)</b> by her parents following an underground operation that went bad during which Lucy shot her. She also has several one-night stands—even a few with men—and engages in other risky behaviors with firearms and various high-speed vehicles. At one point, she gets drunk and wrecks Kay's new Mercedes-Benz. She also gets into a firefight between two helicopters, using handheld firearms.|$|R
50|$|Halena Black had {{her first}} son, Kenny Rae, in 1979. Being that he was her first born child, <b>Black</b> did not <b>notice</b> that {{something}} was wrong. Kenny Rae Black passed in 1980, right before his first birthday {{and was the first}} know infant to die from Ogden Syndrome. However, it did not end there. Halena Black continued to have children and in 1987 she had her next boy, Hyrum. From the start, <b>Black</b> <b>noticed</b> that Hyrum had the same characteristics as Kenny Rae but thought it was {{due to the fact that}} they were brothers. It did not cross her mind that they could share the same underlying disease. Like Kenny Rae, Hyrum passed before his first birthday. It was only until Black's daughters began having children of their own that she realized something was not right. The sons born to Black's daughters looked identical to her own sons and that was when Halena sought medical help. Answers came thirty years after Kenny Rae's death. Ogden Syndrome was discovered in 2011 by a team of researchers led by Gholson J. Lyon, consisting of: Alan F. Rope, Kai Wang, Rune Evjenth, Jinchuan Xing, Jennifer J. Johnston, Jeffrey J. Swensen, W. Evan Johnson, Barry Moore, Chad D. Huff, Lynne M. Bird, John C. Carey, John M. Opitz, Cathy A. Stevens, Tao Jiang, Christa Schank, Heidi Deborah Fain, Reid J. Robison, and 10 others.Just before Lyon was about to publish his findings, another team researching a family living mainly in California contacted him. The newly found family had also lost three infant boys all with shockingly similar characteristics. Lyon tested the new family and found they shared the same rare mutation as the Black family.The existence of another family made this mutation a syndrome, and not something isolated to the Blacks.|$|R
500|$|Catherine Black {{identifies}} Dickerson as an archetypal [...] "lost child", {{raised in}} poor {{foster care and}} neglected. He visits funerals to connect with society, leaving her to wonder what has pushed him to murder. Meanwhile, Dickerson remains in hiding at the scrapyard, while Connor brings him food. Frank <b>Black</b> has <b>noticed</b> that the [...] "S" [...] carved in Tina's stomach matches that seen in the logo for Skorpion Salvage, the scrapyard Dickerson is hiding in. When he and the police arrive to find Dickerson, Connor is able to escape while the yard's dogs attack Dickerson.|$|R
50|$|Overall {{it is also}} {{smaller than}} the other {{subspecies}} and is more variental, and may be from reddish orange to deep <b>black.</b> Another characteristic <b>noticed</b> in the Baluchistan bear {{is that it has}} a darker chest patch than the other subspecies, and that has a thinner head but still has the flanks branching from its head.|$|R
5000|$|Studying both {{engineering}} and art, Black received his BS in Mechanical Engineering from The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Arts in Sciences. Immediately after, he began doing innovative {{work in the}} world of graphic art and mixed media design. As one of his first high-profile projects, Black created and designed the Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? Flash game for ABC. [...] The success of the game gained <b>Black</b> industry <b>notice</b> leading him to start his own company - Modstar Productions, an interactive agency based in Manhattan. Modstar’s client list includes Viacom, Warner Bros., Ford Models, HBO, Def Jam, and Cirque du Soleil.|$|R
60|$|A tall, thin man, with a hard, austere face, {{had stepped}} out of the open doorway. His heavily {{thatched}} eyebrows covered quick, furtive grey eyes, and his gaunt features were hollowed at the cheek and temple like water-grooved flint. He was dressed entirely in <b>black,</b> and I <b>noticed</b> that his shoulders swayed a little {{as if he had been}} drinking.|$|R
50|$|In September 1986 residents, in the Diamond street area of Kingston, {{started to}} <b>notice</b> <b>black</b> sludge {{beginning}} to ooze {{from the ground}} and seep into their gardens and began to complain of health problems to the Logan Council. (p4) By April 1987 the council was warning people to avoid the sludge. Surrounding soils and ground-water were also found to be contaminated.|$|R
5000|$|The {{effect is}} also optimal when the {{thickness}} of the bars in the induction stimulus matches that of those in the test stimulus (i.e., the effect is tuned, albeit broadly, to spatial frequency). This property led to non-redundant effects being reported by people who had used computer monitors with uniformly colored phosphors to do word processing. These monitors were popular in the 1980s, and commonly showed text as green on <b>black.</b> People <b>noticed</b> later when reading text of the same spatial frequency, in a book say, that it looked pink. Also a horizontal grating of the same spatial frequency as the horizontal lines of the induction text (such as the horizontal stripes on the letters [...] "IBM" [...] on the envelope for early floppy disks) looked pink.|$|R
60|$|A {{second time}} the mallet fell, but no sign did the unhappy man give {{of the pain}} which {{instantly}} began to shoot through the limb. After a few more blows the Duke stayed the process and reiterated his questions, but <b>Black</b> took no <b>notice</b> of him whatever. Large beads of sweat broke out on his brow. These were the only visible signs of suffering, unless we except the deathly pallor of his face.|$|R
50|$|The {{flight crew}} {{declared}} an emergency at 8:50 pm (UTC−03:00). Local people around 2 km {{away from the}} crash site saw an airplane flying extremely low. A few moments later they heard explosions and <b>noticed</b> <b>black</b> smoke coming from the ground, which suggested an accident had occurred. Firefighters arrived at the scene three hours later, finding no survivors. The black box was located the following day near the crash site. and retrieved on 20 May.|$|R
40|$|Occasional <b>black</b> {{seeds are}} <b>noticed</b> in 2 ̆ 7 Bragg 2 ̆ 7 seed lots {{obtained}} from large multiplication plots. The frequency of such seeds varies from 10 ^- 5 to 10 ^- 7, {{indicating that the}} black seeds result from spontaneous mutation. The plants grown from black seeds are identical to Bragg plants in every respect so that, without opening the pods on mature plants, {{it is impossible to}} distinguish the two types of plants...|$|R
5000|$|Smith {{was working}} for The Honolulu Advertiser during the Attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941. [...] On {{the morning of the}} attack, {{he and his wife had}} just left an all-night party with some friends when they noticed {{airplanes}} streaking over the shoreline. Shortly after, they <b>noticed</b> <b>black</b> puffs exploding below the planes in the distance. Smith and his friend stood watching in the road beside the car, something he would later describe in a column as [...] "watching the war start." ...|$|R
5000|$|While writing The Negro Family: The Case For National Action, Moynihan was {{employed}} {{in a political}} appointee position at the US Department of Labor, hired to help develop policy for the Johnson administration in its War on Poverty. In the course of analyzing statistics related to <b>black</b> poverty, Moynihan <b>noticed</b> something unusual: Rates of black male unemployment and welfare enrollment, instead of running parallel as they always had, started to diverge in 1962 {{in a way that}} would come to be called [...] "Moynihan's scissors." ...|$|R
50|$|Because there was, at the time, {{no known}} method of {{preserving}} an entire corpse, thefts were performed hastily, often in winter {{to slow the}} rate of decomposition. In the winter of 1788, the number of corpses being exhumed by students increased substantially. The activities of medical students and physicians, who were known colloquially as Resurrectionists in the <b>Black</b> cemetery, were <b>noticed</b> {{by a group of}} freedmen who, on February the 3rd, petitioned the Common Council to take action against it. The petition was largely ignored, and no effort was made to stop the unlicensed exhumations.|$|R
5000|$|Cheryl is a young, African American lesbian {{who works}} in a video rental store in Philadelphia with her friend Tamara. They earn extra money by making {{professional}} home videos for people. Cheryl becomes interested in films from the 1930s and 40s which feature <b>black</b> actresses. She <b>notices</b> that these actresses are often not credited. She watches a film called Plantation Memories with a black actress who is credited simply as [...] "The Watermelon Woman". Cheryl decides to make a documentary about the Watermelon Woman and find out more about her life.|$|R
5000|$|There was a {{man named}} Po, who was said to embody the {{interests}} of all <b>black</b> people. Po <b>noticed</b> that young men left their homelands {{and went to the}} mines, never to return. He then wondered why this was the case, and ventured off to the mines to find out why. When he saw how they lived and how they were treated, Po became upset. He went off to his cave near Pietermaritzburg and pondered, finally coming to the decision that deliverance of these young men was necessary.|$|R
500|$|Black {{traces the}} woman's {{fingerprints}} through a Millennium Group database, finding {{they belong to}} a Tamara Shui Fa Lee, who disappeared at sea near Hong Kong ten years prior—and who Black believes is now dead. Black visits [...] "Lee" [...] at the hospital, where she speaks to him in perfect English, discussing personal events from his life of which she would have no knowledge. As he drives home, he sees her {{on the side of}} the highway and stops to investigate; however, he finds no sign of her and returns home, where he shares an intimate dinner with Catherine and Jordan, later retiring to bed with Catherine—despite their estrangement. <b>Black</b> gradually <b>notices</b> more differences from how his life had been, realizing he has never been a member of the Millennium Group and founded a private investigation firm after leaving the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Returning home again one day, he sees a demon holding Jordan's lifeless body.|$|R
50|$|One day a {{young man}} from America, Bill Dixon (Richard Denning), comes to visit the neighbors on the next farm, and he <b>notices</b> <b>Black</b> Beauty. He can't stay for tea because he is leaving for America, but two years later he sends Anne a gift and a letter from Bill, saying that he will be back soon. Anne then starts riding her horse and {{teaching}} him to jump.

50|$|Lastly Chocolate on White Ware and Bichrome Ware are {{important}} pottery types {{appearing in the}} 16th century. The first of the two types consists of a thick white slip being applied followed by a dark brown paint. This type {{is found in the}} northern region of the country particularly close to the Jordan Valley. The Bichrome Ware the more important of the twocan be found at Tel el-Ajjul and Megiddo among others. Its “pendant” lines or stripes that come usually as black on white slip, or more commonly as red on <b>black</b> can help <b>notice</b> this type of pottery. Bichrome was imported from Cyprus.|$|R
5000|$|According to Touré's New York Times {{review of}} the book, Sag Harbor speaks to a new {{generation}} of wealthy young blacks. In the wake of the election of President Barack Obama and the success of other African Americans in the national spotlight, this story of a wealthy black teenager depicts a situation - [...] "black boys with beach houses" [...] - that was however paradoxical when it took place, in 1985. The novel is a fictional account of Whitehead's life at that time. The 2009 publication of Sag Harbor coincides with what Touré terms the post-black period, when <b>blacks</b> are less <b>noticed</b> for their color and more for their public achievements.|$|R
5000|$|Russell {{recalled}} that {{his high school}} experience was positive, {{and that he did}} not feel discrimination: [...] "In those days, I {{was just one of the}} guys. We had Russian people, we had Jewish kids, we had Mexican kids, we had the <b>blacks,</b> we never <b>noticed</b> things like that... I'm a very cocky little Mexican kid from the East Side, and I never had those feelings. I always feel that it's up to the person." [...] In 1935, at the age of 16, when Russell discovered that Gus Arnheim, a popular and influential band leader, was looking for a drummer, he left high school the summer before his senior year to try and join his band.|$|R
