Plasma <b>density</b> <b>transition</b> trapping is a recently proposed self-injection mechanism for plasma wake field accelerators.

A general set of scaling laws is developed that predicts how the brightness of transition trapping beams, or the beams produced by any plasma system, scales with the plasma density.
