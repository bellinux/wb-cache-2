25|$|The {{majority}} {{community of}} Burma were the Bamar. Among the minority peoples of Burma, including Chins, <b>Karens</b> and Kachins, {{there was a}} mixture of anti-Bamar, anti-Japanese and pro-British sentiments.

This created a large-scale civil conflict which turned the <b>Karens</b> firmly against the Japanese.|$|R
5|$|Continuing west-northwestward, <b>Karen</b> {{attained}} {{its peak}} intensity on November 13 {{with a central}} pressure of 894 mb (hPa; 26.40 inHg). Between November 13 and 14, <b>Karen</b> gradually turned towards the north as it underwent another eyewall replacement cycle. During this time, <b>Karen</b> finally weakened below Category 5 status as its winds dropped below 251 km/h (156 mph). This {{marked the end of}} its near-record 4.25-day span as a storm of such intensity, second only to Typhoon Nancy of 1961 which maintained Category 5 status for 5.5 days. Over the following days, the typhoon's structure gradually became disorganized, with its eye no longer well-defined by November 15. By this time, <b>Karen</b> began accelerating northeastward and later east-northeastward over the open ocean. The combination of its rapid movement and entrainment of cold air into the circulation ultimately caused the system to transition into an extratropical cyclone on November 17. The remnants of <b>Karen</b> continued tracking east-northeast and were last noted by the JTWC on November 18 roughly halfway between the southern Aleutian Islands and northern Hawaiian Islands.|$|E

Meanwhile, Cricket begins to have second thoughts on becoming Karen's surrogate, following Karen's strange behavior towards her and Karen's admission on how she and her husband, Stanley, will raise the child. This prompts Cricket to quit and <b>Karen</b> revealing to Grace that the only reason she wanted a baby was to help her marriage. She also admits that she has thought about leaving her husband.|$|E

50|$|Some {{units were}} {{involved}} in attacks on minority populations (particularly the <b>Karens)</b> and preyed on Indian refugees. The worst atrocities against the <b>Karens</b> in the Irrawaddy Delta south of Rangoon cannot however be attributed to dacoits or unorganised recruits in that rather they were {{the actions of a}} subset of regular BIA and their Japanese officers. The top leadership did eventually stop the actions against the <b>Karens</b> in the delta.|$|R

40|$|This master {{thesis is}} a field study of how culture houses are {{organized}} and how users of culture houses participate. We have conducted {{a case study of}} <b>Karens</b> Minde Kulturhus through observations and especially participant observation. Our research question is: How does <b>Karens</b> Minde Kulturhus work as a place where everybody is welcome and how does the house relate to user participation. Further more we ask: Which conflicts can oppose problems in relation to user participation? The research question integrates Performance-design and Social Science to give {{a better understanding of how}} culture and social space affect one another. The theoretical foundation of the thesis is derived from Bourdieu and his study of fields, capital and habitus. We use Bourdieu as a basis for understanding and exploring the field of practice and most important which forms of capital is needed to access the field. How <b>Karens</b> Minde Kulturhus is organized is an important aspect of how the field works. The thesis analyzes the organization in order to understand how culture policies and organization influence the user participation. Our hypothesis is that there is a conflict between the politically expected neo-liberalization meaning that the culture house needs to be self-financed and is subjected to an expectation of experience economy, and on the other hand the culture house needs to uphold a legitimate relationship to their part of town and its inhabitants. Through the empirical study we analyze and discuss the conflicts or potential conflicts we have observed. We conclude that there are challenges, which <b>Karens</b> Minde Kulturhus needs to overcome in regard to how they organize their culture house. Is <b>Karens</b> Minde Kulturhus a place where professional conducted events take place in an experience economic neo-liberal understanding? Or is it a culture/community house creating citizenship and social community with a broad appeal to the community? Either way the perception of <b>Karens</b> Minde Kulturhus effects the users participation. In that sense <b>Karens</b> Minde is as a place where everybody is welcome. As of now the culture house is a place where everybody can come to whatever event is taking place in the culture house but not if the user wants to participate in the organization to which you need a fundamental understanding of <b>Karens</b> Minde Kulturhus...|$|R
