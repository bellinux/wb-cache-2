The NHRC is found to exist as a mean entity along the coasts of the Hawaiian Islands.

The NHRC veers westward at the northern tip of the Hawaiian Islands, and its subsequent path is not influenced by the presence of the submerged <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>Ridge.</b> This finding does not support the theory that the NHRC is forced by westward propagating, baroclinic Rossby waves reflecting off the <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>Ridge.</b> Using a 2 -layer reduced gravity model of the North Pacific, it is shown that the mean NHRC is due primarily to the mean rather than the time-varying wind forcing.

We find that the amplitudes and phases of the M- 2 tidal components have low-frequency variability, which is consistent with a superposition of an internal tide with the larger barotropic tide. Further, the low-frequency variability is correlated with low-frequency changes in the depth of the pycnocline, which suggests a simple physical mechanism to account for the low-frequency modulations in the internal tidal amplitude.

The trend of Necker Ridge is at an angle to fracture zones and spreading centers in the region, so its origin is controversial, yet it is a major feature on this part of the Cretaceous Pacific Plate. The entire feature, from Necker Island on the <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>Ridge</b> to the eastern Mid-Pacific Mountains, including the adjacent abyssal seafloor, was mapped in 2009 and 2011 with the latest generation of multibeam echosounders. The detailed bathymetry shows the ridge to be constructed of a series of stacked, thick (200 – 400 m) volcanic flows that can be traced along the trend of Necker Ridge for 100 s of km. This continuity suggests that the volcanism erupted simultaneously along almost the entire length of the feature and not as spatially episodic areas of extrusion. Three relatively flat platforms occur on the summit region, presumably constructed of shallow-water carbonates when these portions of the ridge were at sea level. A conspicuous lack of thick pelagic sediment on the non-platform ridge summit and flanks is seen throughout the ridge. The lack of landslides along the length of the ridge is equally puzzling. The southern end of the ridge is connected by a saddle to the Mid-Pacific Mountains whereas the northern end of the ridge is buried by an archipelagic apron of the southern flank of the <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>Ridge...</b>|$|R

These geoid undulations can be generally explained by a simple model in which the load of the seamount chain is supported by a strong, rigid lithospheric plate. The best fitting estimates of the effective elastic thickness of the plate based on data over the <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>Ridge</b> are in the range 25 - 37. 5 km. The elastic thickness cannot be reliably determined from altimeter data over the Emperor Seamounts, although it is probable that it is significantly lower than that obtained for the <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>Ridge.</b> These estimates of the differences in elastic thickness along the seamount chain are in general agreement with previous studies along the chain ad provide useful new constraints on the longterm (more than 106 yr) mechanical properties of the oceanic lithosphere. -Autho...|$|R

40|$|The Hawaiian Islands {{form the}} {{southeast}} {{leg of a}} 5, 000 -km-long string of underwater and subaerial volcanoes called the Hawaiian-Emperor Chain (fig. 1, map sheet, inset). Volcanoes of the Hawaiian Islands form part of a long, discontinuous ridge known as the <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>Ridge</b> (Clague and Dalrymple, 1987). In 1983, the United States defined an Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) around the Hawaiian Islands extending from the coastline to 200 nautical miles offshore (fig. 2, map sheet). The U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) had the primary responsibility to map this zone and in 1984 began the EEZ-SCAN program to systematically map the EEZ at a reconnaissance scale. For assistance with the data collection, the USGS partnered with the Institute of Oceanographic Sciences (IOS) of the United Kingdom. The IOS developed a long-range side-scan-sonar system well suited to this purpose. This system, called GLORIA (Geologic LOng-Range Inclined ASDIC, where ASDIC is another acronym for SONAR, SOund NAvigating Ranging), is capable of imaging a swath of sea floor 40 km wide with each pass of the ship (fig. 3). The map is derived from GLORIA data collected in 1986 - 1989 from the southeastern <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>Ridge</b> EEZ, which covers more than 1, 000, 000 km 2 of sea floor (fig. 2; Groome and others, 1997). The Hawaiian Islands cap the northwest-southeast-trending ridge. Over the past 80 m. y., the Hawaiian-Emperor Chain developed, one volcano after another, as the Pacific Plate moved slowly northwestward over a stationary hot spot. At the hot spot, magma from the Earth’s mantle continually rises through the ocean crust, and lava erupts frequently to slowly build a volcanic seamount.

40|$|Cross-spectral {{techniques}} {{have been used}} to analyze the relationship between gravity and bathymetry on 14 profiles of the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain. The resulting filter or transfer function has been used to evaluate the state of isostasy along the chain. The transfer function can be best explained by a simple model in which the oceani • lithosphere is treated as a thin elastic plate overlying a weak fluid. The best-fitting estimate of the elastic thickness of the plate is in the range 20 - 30 kin. Analysis of individual profiles shows significant differences in the elastic thickness along the seamount chain. Relatively low estimates of the elastic thickness were obtained for the Emperor Seamounts north of 40 øN, and relatively high estimates for the Emperor Seamounts south of 40 øN and the <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>Ridge.</b> These differences cannot be explained by a simple model {{in which there is a}} viscous reaction to the seamount loads through time. The best explanation is a simple model in which the elastic thickness depends on age and hence temperature gradient of the lithosphere. The low values can be explained if the Emperor Seamounts north of 40 øN loaded a relatively young hot plate, and the high values can be explained if the Emperor Seamounts south of 40 øN and the <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>Ridge</b> loaded a relatively old cold plate. These estimates of the elastic thickness along with determinations from other loads on the Pacific lithosphe,re suggest that the elastic thickness corresponds closely to the 450 4 - 150 øC isotherm, based on simple cooling models. Thus the large deformations and associated flexural stresses (> 1 kbar) at seamount loads do not appear to change appreciably through time.

The 1 -D velocity structures and lateral extents of sedimentary, crustal, and subcrustal reflections revealed by these data suggest an interaction between upwelling magma from a hotspot source and bending stress caused by {{the products of the}} upwelling.

Includes bibliographical references. <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>Ridge</b> volcanoes vary {{in volume}} {{by a factor}} of 50 due to {{variations}} in the melt flux of the Hawai‘i mantle plume. One potential cause for these variations is the plume’s temperature. The objective {{of this study is to}} evaluate the relationship between melt flux variations and mantle potential temperature (Tp) of the plume during the formation of the Northwest <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>Ridge</b> (NWHR) that extends 2800 km northwest of the main Hawaiian Islands. Using olivine thermometry of 25 lavas from 10 Hawaiian volcanoes ranging from 1 x 103 km 3 to 54 x 103 km 3 in volume and 4. 5 to 47 Ma in age, mantle potential temperatures are calculated. High-precision electron microprobe analysis of olivine compositions revealed that most of these volcanoes shared similar olivine forsterite (Fo) compositions (~ 80 - 88 % Fo) with the exception of high forsterite olivines in Gardner lavas (91. 85 % Fo, the highest measured in Hawaiian lavas). The highest forsteritic olivines from each sample were used to estimate parental magma compositions. A Monte Carlo simulation method was used to calculate the olivine-liquid equilibration temperature (Tol-liq) of these magmas, the Tp, and uncertainties in temperature associated with equilibrium assumptions made for parental magma composition estimates. The minimum Tol-liq and Tp are for Daikakuji lavas from the second smallest examined volcano at northern end of NWHR (1335 ± 26; 1374 ± 48 oC). The maximum Tp is at Gardner, the largest volcano located in the central part of the NWHR (1614 ± 26; 1703 ± 56 oC). These results yield a Tp increase of 329 oC for the ≥ 12. 4 Ma section of the NWHR. Southeast of Gardner, Tp decreases at Mokumanamana to 1521 ± 50 oC. The Tp of the NWHR volcanoes between Mokumanamana and West Nīhoa show no systematic change similar to variations in the melt flux. The maximum Tp from the southeastern portion of the NWHR was from Nīhoa (1632 ± 54 oC) and the minimum Tp from West Nīhoa (1517 ± 56 oC). A second increase in Tp was observed from new Tp estimates for Kaua‘i (1567 ± 42 oC) to the current estimate range for volcanoes of the Island of Hawai‘i (1632 oC ≥ Tp ≥ 1690 oC). These variations in Tp along the <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>Ridge</b> follow an equivalent trend that is observed in the melt flux. The maximum Tp from each volcano have significant Spearman’s rank correlations with the distance from Mauna Loa, the melt flux, and volumes of these volcanoes. These correlations suggest that there is a strong coupling between the melt flux and the temperature of the Hawaiian mantle plume. Tp estimates from the Galápagos and Iceland hotspots show an opposite cooling trend over time. The Louisville hotspot track shows a dramatic decrease in the melt flux since 20 Ma. The Tp estimates from this study show that the Hawaiian hotspot is unique. The plume’s thermal history shows two instances of increasing Tp with increasing melt flux...|$|R

Quasi-geostrophic wave-topography interactions are considered, with particular regard to Taylor column dynamics. Data from three hydrographic surveys over Southeast Hancock Seamount conducted during summer 1984 and winter 1985 are examined for evidence supporting these hypotheses.

Observed off-ridge energy fluxes generally agree to within a factor of 2 with those produced by a tidally forced numerical model. Average turbulent diapycnal diffusivity K is (0. 5 – 1) 104 m 2 s– 1 above 2000 m, increasing exponentially to 20 104 m 2 s– 1 near the bottom. Microstructure values agree well with those inferred from a finescale internal wave-based parameterization. A linear relationship between the vertically integrated energy flux and ver-tically integrated turbulent dissipation rate implies that dissipative length scales for the radiating internal tide exceed 1000 km. 1...|$|R
40|$|Isopycnal slope spectra were {{computed}} from thermistor data obtained using a microstructure platform towed through turbulence generated by internal tidal motions near the <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>Ridge.</b> The spectra {{were compared with}} turbulence dissipation rates that are estimated using shear probes. The turbulence sub-range of isopycnal slope spectra extends to surprisingly large horizontal wavelengths (100 m). A four-order-of-magnitude range in turbulence dissipation rates at this site reveals that isopycnal slope spectra 2 / 3 k 1 / 3 x. The turbulence spectral subrange (kx 0. 4 cpm) responds to the dissipation rate as predicted by the Batchelor model spectrum, both in amplitude and towed vertical coherence. Scales between 100 and 1000 m are modeled by a linear combination of internal waves and turbulence while at larger scales internal waves dominate. The broad bandwidth of the turbulence subrange means that a fit of spectral amplitude to the Batchelor model yields reasonable estimates of, even when applied at scales of tens of meters that in vertical profiles would be obscured by other fine structure. 1...|$|R

However, few long-term programs exist, and extrapolation of results from one site to larger oceanic expanses is hampered by the lack of spatial coverage inherent to Eulerian sampling. Since 1988, the Hawaii Ocean Time-series program has sampled CO₂ system variables nearly monthly at Station ALOHA, a deep ocean site windward and 115 km north of the island of Oahu. Surface measurements have also been made at Station Kahe, a leeward site 12 km from the island and {{on the opposite side of}} the <b>Hawaiian</b> <b>Ridge.</b> Despite having different physical settings, the sites exhibit identical rates of surface pCO₂ increase and hydrogen ion accumulation, suggesting that atmospheric forcing dominates over local dynamics in determining the CO₂ trend in the surface waters of the North Pacific subtropical gyre...|$|R
