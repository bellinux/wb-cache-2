40|$|The {{analysis}} of the motion of a uniform vortex (patch) of elliptical shape under a relating strain field is employed to investigate the conditions leading to merging for two co-rotating elliptical patches of equal vorticity but different circulation. The motion of the patch having smaller circulation under the rotating strain field induced by the other vortex is analyzed, by considering both the intensity and the rotation rate of the strain constant. Under this assumption, we may adopt a first integral of motion which has been already used to discuss {{the different kinds of}} motion experienced by the elliptical patch. In the present paper, the dependence of the motion on the initial conditions and on the strain parameters is analyzed in further detail, to provide an overall picture of the elliptical patch dynamics. These results are employed in the {{analysis of}} the merging conditions. To this aim, the strain parameters, written in terms of the circulation of the larger vortex and of the distance between the two vortices, are kept frozen at their initial values. For a given circulation of the larger vortex and for a given vorticity and initial configuration of the smaller one, it is possible to find a particular distance between the vortices - transitional distance, d(t) - to which a significant change in the dynamics of the smaller elliptical patch is associated. It is always slightly lower than the critical distance and {{the difference between the two}} values decreases for vanishing size of the smaller vortex. The {{analysis of the}} first integral shows that, for an initial distance larger than d(t), the motion of the vortex leads to small periodic variations of its second-order moment. On the contrary, when the distance is smaller than d(t), the motion implies a large growth of its second-order moment, that is able to force the merging for <b>frozen</b> <b>strain</b> parameters.

40|$|Dynamic {{characteristics}} of soils are of significant {{importance for the}} solution of many soil dynamics problems. The shear modulus, G and the damping ratio, D {{are two of the}} most important dynamic parameters of soil. Nevertheless, geotechnical engineers always have a good understanding on the first parameter, G, but do not have enough knowledge regarding the second parameter, D. The mechanisms that govern energy dissipation in soil remain unclear or even unknown at present, especially from the micromechanics point of view. In this study, numerical simulations by the discrete element method (DEM) were carried out to examine the {{characteristics of}} energy dissipation and dynamic properties in soil under static biaxial test and cyclic shear test. In the simulations of static biaxial test of loose and dense samples, it has been found that the applied boundary work is either stored in the strain energy or dissipated by interparticle friction when viscous energy loss is not considered. At the critical state, the boundary work is used to balance the frictional loss and the strain energy ceases to increase. The release of <b>frozen</b> <b>strain</b> energy can be readily seen in the dense sample when the sample is sheared to dilate and under a strain softening response. In the simulations of cyclic shear test at small strains from 6 x 10 - 6 to 1. 5 x 10 - 4 using sphere particles, both frictional and viscous energy losses were considered. The simulated damping ratio and the associated shear modulus can be obtained from two methods: traced energy and the resulting hysteresis loop. These two methods can render almost identical results. The simulation can reproduce similar responses like the experimental findings in both shear modulus and damping ratio at different confining pressures, strain levels, and strain rates. It has also been realized that not only the lost energy but also the stored energy that is related to the associated shear modulus can significantly affect the response of damping ratio. In addition, the frictional loss mainly takes place at the weak force network but the viscous energy, to a certain extent, is evenly distributed in the strong and weak force networks. In the simulations of cyclic shear test at strains from 2 x 10 - 6 to 7 x 10 - 4 using clump particles, with increasing particle numbers (i. e., decreasing particle sizes) in the sample, the shear modulus decreases whereas the damping ratio increases. Increasing particle numbers leads to decreasing associated contact normal forces among particles, which in turn lower the contact stiffness and therefore the shear modulus of the sample. The damping ratio responses at different strain levels are the net results between the stored energy that is related to the shear modulus, and the dissipated energy that mainly takes place at those weak contacts where the contact normal forces, Fn are less than the associated mean value Fnmean. The shear modulus and damping ratio can also be increased and decreased, respectively, by increasing particle aspect ratio. The simulations regarding aging effects reproduce the experimental observations. The contact normal forces among particles become more homogenized after aging. This in turn increases the shear modulus and leads to increasing contact normal forces at weak contacts, thereby reducing the frictional loss and damping ratio. Both unaged and aged samples have similar shear moduli and damping ratios as strain gradually increases because homogenized contact forces established during aging can be progressively erased by subsequent shearing and associated structural changes...|$|E

This study aims to determine the prevalence of USA 300 in Kurdistan region-Iraq based on this method. We have access to 52 <b>frozen</b> CA-MRSA <b>strains</b> isolated from clinical samples and 10 <b>frozen</b> CA-MRSA <b>strains</b> isolated from healthy carriers. These strains have already been genotyped for SCCmec and PVL gene.

40|$|AIMS: To {{assess the}} {{accuracy}} of the Mast-ID 15 system compared with API 20 E for the identification of stock and fresh clinical strains of Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp; to compare {{the accuracy of}} 19 pin and 36 pin multipoint inoculator heads. METHODS: One hundred frozen stock cultures of Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp which had previously been identified by the API 20 E were classified by the Mast-ID using 19 and 36 pin multipoint inoculator heads. Reproducibility was determined by testing 36 randomly selected organisms in duplicate. Four hundred and sixty nine consecutive fresh clinical isolates of Enterobacteriaceae and Acinetobacter spp were identified by the Mast-ID using a 36 pin multipoint inoculator and by the API 20 E. Reproducibility for the fresh isolates was determined by testing 96 randomly selected strains in duplicate. RESULTS: The Mast-ID 15 identified 82 % and 85 % of <b>frozen</b> <b>strains</b> to species level and reproducibility was 80 % and 86 % using 19 and 36 pin inoculator heads, respectively. Of the 469 fresh clinical isolates, the Mast-ID identified 70 % of strains to species level; 19 % were not identified and 11 % were identified incorrectly by comparison with the API 20 E. The Mast-ID achieved a reproducibility level of 80 % with the fresh clinical isolates. CONCLUSIONS: The use of a 36 pin multipoint inoculator head in preference to the standard 19 pin head for the Mast-ID was advantageous as it allowed greater numbers of strains to be identified at a reduced cost. Unfortunately, in our hands, the Mast-ID system was insufficiently accurate for routine use in the clinical laboratory. Modifications to some of the problematic tests may result in a sufficient increase in accuracy and reproducibility to make the system beneficial in the routine clinical laboratory...|$|R

Genetic {{analysis indicated}} that this strain was missing decades of nucleotide sequence evolution, suggesting an accidental release of a <b>frozen</b> laboratory <b>strain</b> into the general population. Recently, this strain and its descendants were included in an analysis attempting to date the origin of pandemic influenza virus without accounting for the missing decades of evolution. Here, we investigated the effect of using viral isolates with biologically unrealistic sampling dates on estimates of divergence dates. Not accounting for missing sequence evolution produced biased results and increased the variance of date estimates {{of the most recent}} common ancestor of the re-emergent lineages and across the entire phylogeny. Reanalysis of the H 1 N 1 sequences excluding isolates with unrealistic sampling dates indicates that the 1977 re-emergent lineage was circulating for approximately one year before detection, making it difficult to determine the geographic source of reintroduction.

40|$|Strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Torulaspora delbrueckii {{isolated}} from traditional bread doughs displayed dough-raising capacities {{similar to the}} ones found in baker’s yeasts. During storage of <b>frozen</b> doughs, <b>strains</b> of T. delbrueckii (IGC 5321, IGC 5323, and IGC 4478) presented approximately the same leavening ability for 30 days. Cell viability was not significantly affected by freezing, but when the dough was submitted to a bulk fermentation before being stored at 220 &C, there was a decrease in the survival ratio which depended on the yeast strain. Furthermore, the leavening ability after 4 days of storage decreased as the prefermentation period of the dough before freezing increased, except for strains IGC 5321 and IGC 5323. These two strains retained their fermentative activity after 15 days of storage and 2. 5 h of prefermentation, despite showing a reduction of viable cells under the same conditions. The intracellular trehalose content was higher than 20 % (wt/wt) in four of the yeasts tested: the two commercial strains of baker’s yeast (S. cerevisiae IGC 5325 and IGC 5326) and the two mentioned strains of T. delbrueckii (IGC 5321 and IGC 5323).

40|$|The {{laboratory}} and clinical {{evaluation of a}} potassium nitrate-saturated disk for the rapid detection of nitrate reductase production in anaerobes was investigated. The optimal disk concentration and incubation time were determined by utilizing triplicate sets of quadrant plates prepared with supplemented brucella (Difco) blood agar and swabbed with a 24 -h broth (BBL; 135 C thioglycolate) suspension of the test organism. Each set of plates received one control disk and three disks of varying concentrations of potassium nitrate (1 to 8 mg) with 0. 1 % sodium molybdate. All sets were incubated in GasPak jars for 24, 48, or 72 h, and subsequently sulfanilic acid and 1, 6 -Cleve's acid were added to each disk. A pink or red color change was indicative of nitrate reductase production. Eighty-eight stock isolates, 23 American Type Culture Collection strains, and 214 fresh clinical isolates were evaluated and compared with results obtained with tubes of preduced indole-nitrite medium (BBL) incubated for 7 to 10 days.

Although the freeze-tolerant yeast strains DFT and S. cerevisiae MAFF lo- 03056 showed, during freezing, smaller decreases in viability than strain D, the large decreases in CO_ 2 productivity were comparable among all three strains. The CO_ 2 productivity in both freeze-tolerant strains cultured in the presence of 3 % trehalose was about 60 % of that in the unfrozen cells, even after 10 days of frozen storage. The CO_ 2 productivity and actin content of the cell-free extracts prepared from the strain D cultured in YPG medium decreased significantly to about 15 % and 30 % of those of the unfrozen cells, respectively, after 7 days of frozen storage. When the cells cultured in the presence of 3 % trehalose were frozen-stored, the CO_ 2 productivity of the cellfree extracts prepared from 7 -days frozen-stored cells decreased to 50 % of that from the unfrozen cells. The actin content, however, did not decrease after the same frozen storage. In eukaryotic cells, the activities of some glycolytic enzymes are increased by association with actin.
