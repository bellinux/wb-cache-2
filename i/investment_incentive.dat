50|$|His {{proposal}} for a presumptive tax on landed property based on area and location but regardless of actual use was particularly novel. It not only explicitly addressed the problem of tax evasion and misstatement of income but was also meant as an implicit <b>investment</b> <b>incentive.</b> Lands that were more productively cultivated and that received greater investment would be pay proportionately less tax under the scheme. Conversely, presumptive taxation would implicitly penalise idle lands and those held for speculation, stimulating their transfer and sale to more active and conscientious producers. Sancianco opposed taxation based {{on the type of}} crops cultivated, citing as a reason the unpredictability of market conditions and hence the need to allow entrepreneurs as much flexibility as possible.|$|E

40|$|In 2000 the South African Government {{introduced}} an <b>investment</b> <b>incentive</b> for the automotive industry, the Productive Asset Allowance (PAA).

It provides a historical overview of the MIDP and the introduction of the PAA and analyses industry performance data on investment and competitiveness from 1998 to 2004. The findings reveal that while the industry succeeded in increasing exports, the share of domestically produced vehicles in the local market decreased. Moreover, investment in R&D, as an indicator for future competitiveness, was insignificant. The offer of a generic <b>investment</b> <b>incentive</b> like the PAA seems to have a significant and positive effect on industry investment, but limited ability to support long-term industry competitiveness through R&D and innovation. ...|$|E
