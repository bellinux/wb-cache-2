50|$|The tramway also {{introduced}} {{a system to}} allow road-worthy <b>flangeless</b> <b>wheeled</b> wagons on the line, first proposed by Alfred Holt, engineer, and brought into practice by Henry Barcroft of the Bessbrook spinning Co.; the system used a section set of rails, outside the main and slightly lower (7/8 inch), on which the <b>flangeless</b> <b>wheels</b> ran, using the inner main rails as guides.|$|R
5000|$|Birkbyâ€™s Brickworks, small steel wagon with 4 <b>flangeless</b> <b>wheels</b> and forked bracket {{to accept}} haulage chain. It ran on an 18in gauge plateway made up from lengths of steel angle. Donated 1983.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotive}} had Walschaerts {{valve gear}} and was superheated. Its cast steel frame {{was a single}} casting with separately attached cylinders. As built, the third coupled axle had <b>flangeless</b> <b>wheels</b> to negotiate the tight curves found in docks.|$|R
50|$|During 1937, the Class 16C engines were {{fitted with}} Stone-Deuta speed indicators. As built, the second coupled axle had <b>flangeless</b> <b>wheels,</b> {{but these were}} later retyred with flanges to obtain better {{distribution}} of tyre flange wear and improved running.|$|R
5000|$|The wooden flat-topped waggons had iron <b>flangeless</b> <b>wheels</b> and ran in trains of usually twelve waggons {{drawn by}} around 18 horses in single file, in {{front for the}} upward journey and at the rear for the downward. An old sailor called Thomas Taverner wrote a poem which gives us this information: ...|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were built}} with plate frames, Walschaerts valve gear, superheaters and Belpaire fireboxes. It {{was designed to}} have as short a fixed wheelbase as possible and the close spacing of the coupled wheels necessitated specially designed brake hangers outside the wheels. As built, the leading coupled axle had <b>flangeless</b> <b>wheels,</b> but it was subsequently retyred with flanges.|$|R
50|$|It {{opened in}} 1812, {{and was the}} first railway in Scotland to obtain an authorising Act of Parliament; it was also the first railway in Scotland to use a steam locomotive; the first to carry passengers; and the River Irvine bridge, Laigh Milton Viaduct, is the {{earliest}} railway viaduct in Scotland. It was a plateway, using L-shaped iron plates as rails, to carry wagons with <b>flangeless</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were delivered}} with Type TM tenders with an 8 lt 5 lcwt t coal capacity and a 4000 imp gal water capacity. When the coupled wheels were retyred, their diameter on tread was increased from 45+1/2 to 46 in. This reduced their tractive effort to 35030 lbf kN at 75% of boiler pressure, which {{was set at}} [...] The engines, as built, had <b>flangeless</b> <b>wheels</b> on the leading coupled axle, but these were subsequently also flanged as shown in official SAR dimensional locomotive drawings.|$|R
50|$|The engines, {{which became}} nos. 2492 and 2493, arrived early in 1900. Of the 0-8-2T wheel arrangement, they had <b>flangeless</b> <b>wheels</b> {{on the central}} two axles with only an inch clearance, {{probably}} due to difficulty in inserting the changed wheel arrangement into a standard frame design. They had a tractive effort of 25,490 lb. At the end of January 1900 a joint test of the engines with thirty loaded wagons and a 20-ton brake van was undertaken. (The existing limit was 24 loaded wagons.) It was immediately clear that performance was far below that specified.|$|R
2500|$|These {{primitive}} rails were superseded in 1793 {{when the}} then {{superintendent of the}} Cromford Canal, Benjamin Outram, constructed a tramway with 'L'-shaped flanged cast-iron plate rails from the quarry at Crich: {{it was a little}} over a mile in length descending some [...] and had a gauge of [...] Wagons fitted with simple <b>flangeless</b> <b>wheels</b> were kept on the track by vertical ledges, or plates. Cast-iron rails were a significant improvement over wooden rails as they could support a greater weight and the friction between wheel and rail was lower, allowing longer trains to be moved by horses.|$|R
50|$|The {{distinctive}} designs by James Pearson, {{the railway}} company's engineer, featured single large <b>flangeless</b> driving <b>wheels</b> and two supporting bogies. The water was carried in both well and back tanks, leaving the boilers exposed {{in the same}} way as tender locomotives.|$|R
5000|$|The Australian Standard Garratt had <b>flangeless</b> leading driving <b>wheels</b> which {{tended to}} cause {{derailments}} on sharp curves.|$|R
50|$|The {{first eight}} known 4-2-4 {{locomotives}} entered {{service on the}} broad gauge Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1853 and 1854, numbered {{in the range from}} 39 to 46. They had 9 ft diameter <b>flangeless</b> driving <b>wheels,</b> supported by leading and trailing two-axle bogies. The water was carried in both well- and back-tanks. Two more engines were built in 1859 and 1862, but with much smaller 7 ft diameter driving wheels.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were set}} up to run cab (or bunker) first, effectively as a 4-4-0 (or 6-4-0). The 4-4-0 wheel arrangement, with its three-point suspension, was noted for its good tracking ability, while the <b>flangeless</b> middle <b>wheels</b> allowed the locomotive to round tight curves. Placing the fuel and water over the truck rather than the driving wheels meant the locos had a constant adhesive weight, something other forms of tank locomotive did not.|$|R
50|$|The Class NG15 2-8-2 {{locomotive}} was {{a development}} of the Class Hd and Class NG5 locomotives which had been acquired for the Otavi Mining and Railway Company in SWA in 1912 and 1921 respectively. In the 1920s, one of the Class NG5 locomotives {{was sent to the}} Avontuur Railway in South Africa for trials, but since it jammed on the tighter curves in the Langkloof despite having one set of <b>flangeless</b> coupled <b>wheels,</b> it was returned to SWA.|$|R
50|$|This {{system was}} not {{suitable}} for steam locomotives so Arnoux invented a separate system for them. The locomotives had a 2-4-2 wheel arrangement and the driving <b>wheels</b> were <b>flangeless.</b> The carrying <b>wheels</b> were arranged to pivot and were controlled by near-horizontal guide wheels.|$|R
50|$|This wheel {{arrangement}} was mainly used on various tank locomotive configurations. Eight 4-2-4 well- and back-tank locomotives which entered {{service on the}} Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1853 {{appear to have been}} the first with this wheel arrangement. The engine was designed by James Pearson, the railway company's engineer, and featured single large <b>flangeless</b> driving <b>wheels</b> between two supporting four-wheeled bogies. The water was carried in both well- and back-tanks, leaving the boilers exposed {{in the same way as}} on most tender locomotives.|$|R
50|$|The 1922-vintage Class NG5 {{was placed}} in service on the 352 mi narrow-gauge line from Swakopmund on the Atlantic coast to Tsumeb and Grootfontein in South West Africa (SWA). They spent their whole service life in SWA, except {{for a brief period}} when one of them was sent to the Avontuur Railway in the Eastern Cape for trials. However, since it jammed on the tighter curves in the Langkloof despite having one set of <b>flangeless</b> coupled <b>wheels,</b> it was soon {{returned}} to SWA.|$|R
50|$|In service, the {{locomotives}} disappointed. In {{spite of}} {{the two sets of}} <b>flangeless</b> coupled <b>wheels</b> and the Krauss-Helmholtz system, the Class 18 experienced excessive flange and tyre wear while the Chief Civil Engineer claimed increased rail wear. The cylinder design was outdated and along with the lightweight motion and rods, contributed to them being uneconomical high-maintenance machines. The complicated valve gear was not robust enough and frequently gave trouble owing to wear and breakage. The result was that the locomotives had to be shopped at under 40000 mi.|$|R
5000|$|The railway {{was built}} to remove a [...] "bottleneck" [...] to Staffordshire potteries by {{building}} a line from Norden to Middlebere Tramway which was opened in 1806 to a [...] gauge for 3.4 miles long. The rails were cast iron, L-shaped 3 ft long and weighing 40 lb, the horse-drawn clay wagons had <b>flangeless</b> <b>wheels,</b> and the sleepers were simply stone blocks (60-70 lb) numbering well in excess of 10,000. (some of the sleepers remain in place today, complete with holes where the rails used to be fixed. Others {{have been used as}} paving stones at Langton Wallis Cottage.) The cast iron rails secured to stone blocks (with metal spike and oak dowel) set in the ground. In 1807 the line was extended south under the Wareham to Corfe road. The tunnel exists and is grade listed however it is blocked, [...] a second tunnel was built in 1825 east of the first tunnel but is now blocked and is not grade listed. In 1881 when the LSWR built the Swanage line the line was extended east parallel to the line and Eldons Sidings were built to transfer clay to the standard gauge network. In 1907 Middlebere plateway was abandoned but had been in continual use for 101 years, The quay at Middlebere creek has fallen into disrepair and almost vanished. Some of the stone sleepers remain in place today, complete with holes where the rails used to be fixed, whilst others have been reused as paving stones at various locations. Others {{can be found in the}} walls at Middlebere farm. In many places the route across Hartland moor can be traced.|$|R
40|$|In the 1990 s, {{significant}} {{experience has}} been gained with high-speed passenger rail technologies. On the one hand, high speed versions of conventional-configuration trains, such as the French TGV, have proven themselves in service; on the other hand, magnetic levitation (maglev) trains such as the German Transrapid, which some expected to supplant conventional trains in some high speed applications, have not yet proven themselves and face a problematic future. This is because of maglev's high capital cost, the magnetic drag which it introduces, and the high development risks associated with this complex technology. This paper examines {{a new form of}} high-speed train expected to be capable of speeds of 300 mph, the Maglift Monorail. The Maglift Monorail was developed by simplifying and improving two well-understood technologies â€“ wheelsets and LIMs â€“ and then integrating them. The solution is a vehicle with <b>flangeless</b> <b>wheels</b> mounted in two axes, powered by a high-efficiency and light-weight LIM, positioned to give magnetic lift (maglift), i. e., electromagnetic force in the vertical direction which reduces the vehicle weight on the suspension, and thereby reduces static and rolling drag. Maglift can be considered a form of maglev as it uses the same electromagnetic forces to lift and propel the vehicle. This solution is presented in a Spanish-designed monorail system which has a unique suspension designed to minimize friction while giving great stability and turning capability. This monorail vehicle is propelled by the Seraphim motor (SEgmented RAil PHased Induction Motor) which virtually eliminates magnetic drag and provides significant maglift. The Maglift Monorail achieves lower operating costs and a greater overall reduction in drag than conventional noncontact maglev does, and it does so without incurring maglev's high capital costs or its technology development risks...|$|R
50|$|The first 4-2-2 {{to have a}} bogie {{was built}} by Archibald Sturrock of the Great Northern Railway (GNR) in 1853. This had 7 ft <b>flangeless</b> driving <b>wheels,</b> and was only {{moderately}} successful, having a tendency to derail. By the 1870s, improved design of bogies giving more flexibility enabled designers to create fast standard gauge express passenger locomotives of this type. On the GNR, Patrick Stirling built 53 examples with outside cylinders at Doncaster railway works between 1870 and 1895, for use on the main line between London and York. They ran at an average speed of more than 60 mph during the race to the north, and were called eight-footers because of the driving wheel, {{that was more than}} 8 ft. in diameter. Stirling's successor Henry Ivatt built a further twelve singles between 1898-1901 before moving on to larger 4-4-2 designs.|$|R
5000|$|Due to the {{availability}} of water power this system was used until {{the closure of the}} Clausthal and Lautenthal Pits in the 1930s (e.g. at the Silbersegen Shaft and the Black Pit or Schwarze Grube). steam power was first used in earnest when the stone coal necessary for its operation could be delivered by railway {{towards the end of the}} 19th century. Electricity began to be generated at about the same time using water power from the Upper Harz Water Regale - an extensive network of ponds, dams, ditches and tunnels, originally built to supply the mines with water power. In 1900 water was passed through turbines and electrical winding engines. At that time modern pits emerged with steel hoist frames. The most important innovation in the Upper Harz hauling technology was the Albert Cable (Albert-Seil). Chief Mining Engineer (Oberbergrat) Wilhelm Albert (1787-1846) made a cable out of steel wire which was first successfully tested on 23 July 1834 at the Carolina Shaft. That was the birth of the wire cable. As the distance between shaft and workings lengthened and increasing quantities of material had to be moved, wheelbarrows or small wagons (the Hunte or Hunde) were used underground as horizontal methods of transportation. Up to 1800 they ran on wooden planks with <b>flangeless</b> <b>wheels</b> and guide pins (SpurnÃ¤geln). Thereafter iron rails took over, initially as hand-forged rails (Hammelpfote) only one metre long. Until 1900 the wagons were almost always pushed by hand. Pit ponies were not used in the Upper Harz. From 1905 at the Clausthal Ore Mine (Erzbergwerk Clausthal) underground haulage was carried out using conductor engines in the gallery known as the Tiefsten Wasserstrecke or [...] "Deepest Watercourse". In the Grund Ore Mine (Erzbergwerk Grund) battery-driven locomotives were used from the 1970s and, finally, diesel engines on wheels with rubber tyres. One feature mining in the Upper Harz was the underground transportation of material in boats on the Tiefe Wasserstrecke about 300 metres deep, in Clausthal and Zellerfeld from 1835 to 1898.|$|R
50|$|From 1935, all the ex Class 14B {{locomotives}} except no. 1750 were reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2 boilers and reclassified to Class 14R. Only slight modifications {{were found}} {{necessary to take}} the new boilers. In the process, the engines were also equipped with Watson cabs with their distinctive slanted fronts, compared to the conventional vertical fronts of the original cabs. The <b>flangeless</b> leading coupled <b>wheels</b> were flanged and Type MR tenders were attached to the reboilered engines. No. 1750 was sold to ISCOR without being reboilered.|$|R
50|$|From 1935, all the Class 14 {{locomotives}} were reboilered with Watson Standard no. 2 boilers and reclassified to Class 14R. In the process, {{the engines}} were also equipped with Watson cabs with their distinctive slanted fronts, {{compared to the}} conventional vertical fronts of the original cabs. Only slight modifications were found necessary to take the new boilers, such as a cast packer under the smokebox saddle and a widening of the running board below the cab. The <b>flangeless</b> leading coupled <b>wheels</b> were flanged and Type MR tenders were attached to the reboilered engines.|$|R
25|$|Of {{the nine}} 9F's {{to have survived}} into {{preservation}} {{two members of the}} class have run on the mainline in preservation, no 92203 Black Prince & 92220 Evening Star. Due to the engines <b>flangeless</b> centre driving <b>wheels</b> and the worry that the raised check rails on modern pointwork may cause a derailment the class alongside other 2-10-0 locomotives are presently banned from operating on the mainline including the Esk Valley Line from Battersby to Whitby which is used by the North Yorkshire Moors Railway on their Grosmont to Whitby trains alongside the regular passenger services on the route.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first two}} {{locomotives}} were built at Swindon Works in 1849 for working trains on the steep and tightly-curved [...] South Devon Railway which {{at that time}} was operated by locomotives from the Great Western Railway. The frames only ran {{from the front of the}} <b>flangeless</b> forward driving <b>wheels</b> to the rear buffer beam. The bogie swivelled in a ball-and-socket joint, riveted to a gussett under the boiler barrel. The operation of South Devon Railway had been contracted by that company to Messrs Evans and Geach from 1851 [...] - [...] using new 4-4-0STs designed by Daniel Gooch - and so the Bogie Class found use on other parts of the Great Western network. In 1855 additional locomotives were built for the GWR by R and W Hawthorn.|$|R
