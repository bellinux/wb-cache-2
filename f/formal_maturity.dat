50|$|Two {{groups of}} artists emerged from those gatherings {{that led the}} way across the path of Modern Art in Argentina: Concrete-Invention Art Association (in Spanish, Asociación Arte Concreto Invención) and Madí Arts (Arte Madí). Both {{rejected}} figuration and representation, to which they opposed the invention. In other words, the creation in a pure sense. The ultimate abstraction. A visual morphology not addressing anything in particular. These ideas were later developed in the Arturo magazine, whose single issue appeared in 1944. Given Enio’s young age, he is first a spectator, but quickly became {{an active member of the}} Concrete-Invention group, giving birth to his first painting over a linoleum sheet that same year. The following year, the artist took his first step into sculpture with Opposite Directions, a work of great <b>formal</b> <b>maturity</b> despite being a debut piece.The members of the Concrete-Invention Art Association showcased their first public exhibition in the Peuser art salon, located in Florida street. Among the participants were Claudio Girola, Tomás Maldonado, the Lozza brothers, Alberto Molemberg, Primaldo Mónaco, Nuñez, Liddi Prati, Jorge Souza and Enio, who took his mother’s last name - Iommi- as his alias to distinguish himself from his brother. The traditional art circles and part of the press replied negatively to the cutting-edge proposal of the Geometric art. Without giving up, the members of the association met every Saturday to discuss new concepts. Enio Iommi drew visual sustenance from artists such as Max Bill and Georges Vantorgerloo. It seems that the sculpture Torn Circles is opposing to the theoretical bases of the Constructivism and, as the titles announces, it foreshadows one trait of his work: to sever from models that begin to suffocate his desire to explore new horizons. They continued presenting group expositions until 1950, when the association disbanded. Due to the initiative of the critic Aldo Pellegrini, another crew was formed under the name of Modern Artists of Argentina (in Spanish, Artistas Modernos de la Argentina), which flocked together independent Abstract and Concrete Art sculptors and painters. Maldonado, Hlito, Iommi, Sarah Grilo, Fernandez Muro, Ocampo, Aebi and Claudio Girola staged collective shows in Viau and Krayd galleries. Also, in the Museum of Modern Art of Rio de Janeiro, where they applied pioneering museological criteria.|$|E
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} that Requirements Engineering (RE) {{has an important}} implication for the overall success of software or system development projects. As more and more organizations consider RE as the principal problem areas in the projects, improving RE process therefore appears critical for future business success. Moreover, nowadays there are evidences that support improving RE process maturity can contributes to improved business performance. There exist generic Software Process Improvement (SPI) standards, specialised RE process improvement models as well as guidance and advices on RE. However, they suffer from various issues that limit their adoption by organizations that are interested to assess and improve their RE process capability. Therefore, the research {{presented in this paper}} proposes a new RE process improvement model. The model is built by adapting and expanding the structure of the continuous representation of the <b>formal</b> <b>maturity</b> framework Capability Maturity Model Integration for Development (CMMI-DEV) developed by the Software Engineering Institute (SEI) through three rounds of development and validation stages, which involved RE and CMMI expert panel in the software industry. This paper aims to provide an overview on what, why and how we build the maturity model for RE. The intention is to provide a foundation for future development in the area of RE process improvement...|$|E
40|$|Over an {{insecure}} network, agents need {{means to}} communicate securely. To these means we often call security protocols. Security protocols, although constructed over {{the arrangement of}} simple security blocks, normally target the yielding of complex goals. They seem simple at a first glance, but hide subtleties {{that allow them to}} be exploited. One way of trying to systematically capture such subtleties is through the usage of <b>formal</b> methods. The <b>maturity</b> of some methods for protocol verification is a fact today. But these methods are still not able to capture the whole set of security protocols being designed. With the convergence to an on-line world, new security goals are proposed and new protocols need to be designed. The evolution of formal verification methods becomes a necessity to keep the pace with this ongoing development. This thesis covers the Inductive Method and its extensions. The Inductive Method is a formalism to specify and verify security protocols based on structural induction and higher-order logic proofs. The account of our extensions comes to enable the Inductive Method to reason about non-Unicast communication and threshold cryptography...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Maturity {{assessments}} of business processes and capabilities are powerful tools for organizational improvement. Business process modelling {{is a key}} activity {{in the assessment of}} organizational maturity and capability of processes. How-ever, the resulting models are complex and can often not be communicated successfully to the organizational stakeholders. Similarly, assessment methods rely strongly on the expertise of the assessors translating their perception of an organization into an assessment outcome. These {{assessments of}}ten carry a subjective component and are hard to compare. Moreover, they lack efficient traceability mechanisms as organizations evolve. Additionally, mainstream methods such as ISO 15504 and SCAMPI are complex, expensive and resource demanding, which place them out of reach for many organizations. This paper describes a research approach that builds on Enterprise Architecture models and IT Governance frameworks to guide the definition of a simple process metamodel for maturity assessment. This simple meta-model is used to create an interme-diary representation that can be communicated to stakeholders. A <b>formal</b> expression of <b>maturity</b> conditions in SPARQL queries increases the objectivity of the assessment and separates it from the collected and formalized evidence. We discuss our model and method and report on a preliminary case study. I...|$|R
40|$|Para acercarnos al pensamiento creativo de Fernando Higueras como arquitecto, partimos del estudio de sus constantes creativas en evolución cronológica divididas en 9 direcciones de investigación. En ellas observamos la importancia de su obra NO CONSTRUIDA, como germen de las constantes creativas de su pensamiento y parte de ella la estudiamos, analizamos y reconstruimos gráficamente en 3 D. Fernando Higueras aprendía de sus obras o propuestas arquitectónicas anteriores llegando a la madurez constructiva y formal colmada de Belleza a través de la composición y combinación de dichas constantes con pasmosa naturalidad. Además es importante añadir, para {{llegar a}} la comprensión de las constantes del pensamiento creativo del arquitecto, el componente de “intuición” de todo artista, de su modo de mirar y observar las cosas como fuente de inspiración. El “modo de mirar” del arquitecto nos habla de su sensibilidad al hábitat popular y vernáculo del hombre. Gracias a Antonio Miró en el período 1963 - 1970, Fernando Higueras pudo dar marco real a gran parte de sus ideas constructivas. El objeto de estudio del presente trabajo es llegar a las “invariantes” del arquitecto para comprender su pensamiento creativo. Los objetivos del presente estudio han sido conocer mejor su pensamiento, su obra desde un punto de vista cronológico-evolutivo para poder llegar a entender las relaciones y conexiones creativas entre unas y otras, observar y constatar la evolución de sus constantes creativas y compositivas, de analizar gráficamente parte de su obra no construida para llegar a la mejor comprensión de dichas constantes reconstruyéndolas con los medios gráficos digitales actuales. La reconstrucción en 3 D de parte de su obra no construida constata la magnitud de su pensamiento creativo. La metodología empleada parte de la recopilación de toda la información necesaria, escritos, artículos en revistas o periódicos, críticas, observaciones, planos, proyectos, memorias, fotografías de la época, maquetas, opiniones de sus contemporáneos, familiares o amigos y visita de parte de su obra construida. A partir de ahí se fijan 9 direcciones de investigación para cada constante de su pensamiento creativo. En cada dirección se analiza desde dos puntos de vista diferentes. Un primer punto de vista teórico o cronológico-evolutivo a partir de la selección de algunas de sus obras construidas y no construidas. Y otro segundo punto de vista gráfico basándose en el estudio y reconstrucción de parte de su obra no construida. En resultado, se ha estudiado la evolución de su obra viendo las conexiones y relaciones entre unas y otras llegando a la madurez de sus constantes creativas en sus obras, algunas construidas y otras no construidas. Fernando Higueras se perfecciona así mismo, intentando hacer las cosas cada vez un poco mejor, llegando a dominar sus propias constantes en total madurez y expresión formal y constructiva. La elaboración de modelos tridimensionales en 13 proyectos de su obra no construida nos refresca la capacidad de su pensamiento creativo, además de analizar en parte de ellas los gérmenes constructivos y compositivos de muchas de sus ideas o constantes creativas. Finalmente, este trabajo ha contribuido a llegar a entender a Fernando Higueras en una dimensión más amplia, desde el frescor de su obra no construida hasta la capacidad de su pensamiento creativo, de la evolución de sus constantes, del estudio de sus últimos proyectos no construidos, de su sensibilidad a todas las artes y a todo lo que engloba Belleza. Las 360 láminas de dibujos que se aportan inician el estudio y análisis de su vasta obra no construida. ABSTRACT The {{analysis}} of Fernando Higueras's creative thought {{as an architect}} begins with a study of his main creative themes and their chronological evolution, divided into nine directions of research. Here we see the importance of his UNBUILT work as the germ of the creative themes of his thought, part of which we study, analyse and reconstruct graphically in 3 -D. Fernando Higueras drew on his earlier architectural works and ideas and reached an ultimate constructive and <b>formal</b> <b>maturity</b> that was infused with beauty through composition and the amazingly natural combination of these keynote themes. In order to gain {{a greater understanding of}} the key themes of the architect's creative thought it is also worth noting the element of artists' intuition, their way of seeing and observing the world as a source of inspiration. The architect's "way of seeing" reveals his sensitivity to the popular and traditional human habitat. Thanks to Antonio Miró, in the period between 1963 and 1970 Fernando Higueras was able to provide a real framework for a large part of his constructive ideas. The object of study of the present work is to determine the architect's “invariables” as a means of understanding his creative thought. The aims of the present study are to explore his thoughts in greater depth, to examine his work from the chronological-evolutionary point of view for an insight into the relationships and the creative connections between them, to observe and apprehend the evolution of his main creative themes and compositional keynotes, to analyse graphically part of his unbuilt work in order to improve our understanding of these underlying themes through their reconstruction using the latest graphic digital resources. The 3 -D reconstruction of part of his unbuilt work highlights the magnitude of his creative thought. The methodology used to collect all the necessary information includes an examination of his writings and articles in journals and newspapers, criticisms, observations, plans, projects, building specifications, period photographs, models, the opinions of his contemporaries, family and friends, and visits to some of his built work. Nine directions of research were then established for each main theme of his creative thought. Each direction includes an analysis from two different points of view: the first, theoretical or chronological-evolutionary aspect, based on a selection of some of his built and unbuilt works; and a second graphic aspect based on the study and reconstruction of part of his unbuilt work. The result is a survey of the evolution of his work with a view to establishing the connections and their interrelationships, through to the ultimate maturity of his creative themes in both his built and unbuilt work. Fernando Higueras is on a constant quest for excellence, a perpetual desire to do things a little better, until a point where he gains mastery over his own recurrent themes, in the fullness of maturity and of his formal and constructive expression. The creation of three-dimensional models in 13 projects of his unbuilt work offers a new look at the capacity of his creative thought, in addition to the analysis of the evidence in some of these projects of the constructive and compositional germs of many of his ideas and themes. Finally, this work has contributed to the understanding of Fernando Higueras in a broader dimension, from the freshness of his unbuilt work through to the capacity of his creative thought, the evolution of his main themes, the study of his final unbuilt works, his sensitivity to the arts as a whole and to everything beautiful. The 360 plates of illustrations provided form the basis of the study and analysis of his extensive unbuilt work...|$|E

The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a {{repeated}} dribbling ability (RDA) test for young soccer players. Variability by age groups, association between repeated dribbling and repeated sprints (RSA), and reproducibility of RDA protocol were considered. The sample consisted of 58 young male soccer players (15. 98 ± 1. 74 years) who were measured in RSA and RDA protocols within the following age groups and according to the structure of Portuguese youth soccer: under- 15 (n= 16), under- 17 (n= 19) and under- 19 (n= 23). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to test the effect of age group in body size, maturity and functional capacities. Multiple linear regression analyses were used to estimate the relative contributions of years of <b>formal</b> training, CA, <b>maturity,</b> body size and thigh volume to variation in RDA and RSA, and also the relationship between RSA and RDA. Older players performed significantly better, but post-hoc comparisons showed that differences were not significant between 15 - 16 and 17 - 18 years. Repeated dribbling ability was more related to lower limb strength than with any other anthropometric or functional variable and a large relationship between RSA and RDA was found, but only for total time. Analysis of RDA reproducibility (2 time moments) confirmed the future usefulness of the test (reliability coefficients: total time = 0. 83 and ideal time = 0. 85). RDA might be a useful test to assess young soccer players from beginners to older players. In the meantime, future research using sportspecific distance with variation in the number of repetitions, among different age groups, competitive level and playing position is needed for a better insight considering validity assets...|$|R
5000|$|In 1927 he {{had applied}} for a Guggenheim Fellowship and was denied, but he reapplied and won the {{fellowship}} in 1929. He studied in France for a year, and chose not to extend his fellowship another six months. While many contemporary artists looked back to Africa for inspiration, Motley {{was inspired by the}} great Renaissance masters whose work was displayed at the Louvre. He found in the artwork there a <b>formal</b> sophistication and <b>maturity</b> that could give depth to his own work, particularly in the Dutch painters and the genre paintings of Delacroix, Hals, and Rembrandt. Motley’s portraits take the conventions of the Western tradition and update them—allowing for black bodies, specifically black female bodies, a space in a history that had traditionally excluded them. He felt that portraits in particular exposed a certain transparency of truth of the internal self. Thus, he would focus on the complexity of the individual in order to break from popularized caricatural stereotypes of blacks such as the [...] "darky," [...] "pickaninny," [...] "mammy," [...] etc. Motley understood the power of the individual, {{and the ways in which}} portraits could embody a sort of palpable machine that could break this homogeneity. He took advantage of his westernized educational background in order to harness certain visual aesthetics that were rarely associated with blacks. Thus, he would use his knowledge as a tool for individual expression in order to create art that was meaningful aesthetically and socially to a broader American audience. By acquiring these skills, Motley was able to break the barrier of white-world aesthetics. The use of this acquired visual language would allow his work to act as a vehicle for racial empowerment and social progress.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Computer Science)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2013. The {{need for}} {{information}} systems has increased {{to a point where}} virtually all business environments require some sort of software to aid in its daily operations. This study will address the need for quality information systems by examining techniques which can potentially aid in producing consistent high-quality information systems. Two techniques in particular, namely Process Maturity Models (PMMs) and Systems Development Methodologies (SDMs) are examined. Process Maturity Models such as the Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) as well as the ISO- 9000 standards aid in standardising and improving an organisation’s information systems development processes. These Process Maturity Models often require either the use of certain Systems Development Methodologies {{or at the very least}} techniques used within some Systems Development Methodologies. Systems Development Methodologies refer to a set of development processes, tools, techniques etc. which can be used during software development to standardise the entire development process by offering the use of modelling techniques, tools to analyse requirements, illustration of processes etc. These techniques differ from one Systems Development Methodology to the next. This study aims to identify the relationship between Process Maturity Models and Systems Development Methodologies. During the research process a questionnaire was sent out to people within the information technology business environment. The questionnaire contained questions used to determine and measure the usage of Systems Development Methodologies and how projects were affected. The questionnaire was also used to do an informal assessment of each respondent’s Capability Maturity Model level. Furthermore the data retrieved was statistically analysed and the results were interpreted. The results indicate that a relationship exists between the use of SDMs and the success of the respondent’s development processes and developed products. A total of 73 % of respondents indicated that they do use SDMs to some extent, the most common being the Systems Development Lifecycle (SDLC). The majority of organizations implementing SDMs have been doing so for three years or more. Results also show that most of the respondents are not certified in some <b>formal</b> Process <b>Maturity</b> Model; however, they do implement some of the processes required by models such as the CMMI. An informal assessment performed indicated that 65 % of respondents can be grouped into a perceived CMMI level 2 category. Project outcome was measured and the relationship between PMM implementation as well as SDM use was measured. Results show no statistical evidence which indicates that an organisation’s perceived CMMI level is influenced by SDM use, both vertically and horizontally. Results do, however, indicate that organizations which have been implementing SDMs for a longer period of time are more likely to apply CMMI level 4 activities. Results also indicate that the horizontal use (number of projects/people which implement SDM knowledge) of SDMs have a significant effect on the development process- and the developed product success. Lastly the results indicated that organizations which satisfy more of the CMMI’s level 4 activities experience a higher quality development process which leads to a more successful development process.
