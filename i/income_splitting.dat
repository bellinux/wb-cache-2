50|$|The NESiCAxLive system {{consists}} of an arcade system board combined with a dedicated router to access and download games. The system currently works on the Taito Type X2, Taito Type X Zero and Taito Type X3 arcade boards. The connected machines access the Taito NESYS online network to allow arcade operators to download games from Taito's servers directly to the arcade cabinet; previously arcade operators had to purchase new game boards (as well as dispose of old ones) to run a new game. Games can also be downloaded to a local server to allow quicker distribution to machines, as well as allow rapid swapping {{in and out of}} games according to player demand. Taito allows arcade operators to download games free, as part of a revenue sharing system, with <b>income</b> <b>split</b> with Taito and the game developer.

50|$|After {{enacting}} <b>income</b> <b>splitting</b> for retired {{couples in}} 2006, in 2011 the Conservative Party of Canada led by Stephen Harper won a majority government with a platform promising limited <b>income</b> <b>splitting.</b> The proposed policy would allow families, with children under 18, to split their household income {{of up to}} $50,000, once the federal budget was balanced.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} {{results of}} our survey of licensing at 62 research universities. We consider ownership, <b>income</b> <b>splits,</b> stage of development, marketing, license policies and characteristics, goals of licensing {{and the role of}} the inventor in licensing. Based on these results we analyze the relationship between licensing outcomes and both the objectives of the TTO and the characteristics of the technologies. Patent applications grow one-to-one with disclosures, while sponsored research grows similarly with licenses executed. Royalties are typically larger the higher the quality of the faculty and the higher the fraction of licenses that are executed at latter stages of development. Sponsored research is more likely to be included in a license if the new technology is at an early stage of development or if the TTO evaluates it as important. We find that additional disclosures generate smaller percentage increases in licenses, and those increases in licenses generate smaller percentage increases in royalties. University licensing has increased dramatically since the passage of the Bayh-Dole Act in 1980, which gave universities the right to retain title to and license inventions resulting from federallysponsore...|$|R

Parental leave benefits, child benefits and subsidized childcare are found to have substantial fertility effects.

50|$|While {{its effects}} on the {{national}} debt have increased substantially in recent years, <b>income</b> <b>splitting</b> became required for married persons filing jointly in the United States in 1948. After two successive vetoes by President Harry S. Truman, a GOP-led effort in Congress obtained enough votes to institute the splitting of marital income. Until then, only single filing was permitted. However, couples in community property states such as California had access to de facto <b>income</b> <b>splitting,</b> since one-half of the income of one spouse {{could be attributed to}} the other spouse. This led to issues of patriarchal taxpayers in community property states paying lower tax rates than patriarchal taxpayers in common law states and hastened the passage of de jure <b>income</b> <b>splitting.</b> While other solutions to this distortion in community property states were available, political activism to establish a male entitlement (or first right) to paid work, and to push women back into unpaid or lower paid work after their substantial economic contributions during World War II, led to the override of Truman's double veto.|$|E

50|$|The {{section of}} the {{legislation}} is 660A of the UK Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988. Using the revised (April 2003) interpretation of s.660A, UK HMRC have been targeting businesses set up by spouses where they are aware that <b>income</b> is <b>split</b> between the spouses, and {{only one of them}} directly generates that income. In theory s.660A can apply to partnerships as well as limited companies, this has yet to be tested in the UK courts. In 2007 the interpretation was finally rejected by the Law Lords, resulting in the government proposing new leglisation to tackle the perceived abuse.|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study of certain means {{available}} to taxpayers who wish to <b>split</b> their <b>income</b> {{with other members of}} their family and thereby reduce their taxes. There are essentially four sections to the study: (a) a description of the Canadian system of taxation of the family and the reasons why the Income Tax Act treats each individual as a separate unit for income tax purposes as opposed to recognizing the family unit itself as the basis for taxation; (b) an analysis of the tax consequences of loans and transfers of property between spouses; (c) an analysis of the tax consequences of loans and transfers of property to {{children under the age of}} 18 years; and (d) an analysis of the concept of indirect payments. The principal conclusion of the study is that the means available to <b>split</b> <b>income</b> among family members are limited, especially in view of the recent amendments to the Income Tax Act to gradually eliminate the "family loan" method of <b>splitting</b> <b>income...</b>|$|R

The analysis {{is based on}} a novel dynamic microsimulation model that combines simulated family life-cycles for a base population from the 2009 wave of the German Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) with a comprehensive tax-benefit model. The results indicate that households in Germany benefit considerably from family- and marriage-related transfers, yet also reveal substantial variation behind the population average. Moreover, it is shown that some measures, such as <b>income</b> tax <b>splitting,</b> may make individuals in fact worse off, in financial terms, over the long course, as a result of negative labour supply incentives which are rein-forced through detrimental effects on human capital accumulation. ...|$|R
