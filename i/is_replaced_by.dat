5|$|Almost regularly, a plain iota <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> the epsilon-iota diphthong (commonly if imprecisely {{known as}} itacism), e.g. ΔΑΥΕΙΔ instead οf ΔΑΥΙΔ, ΠΕΙΛΑΤΟΣ instead of ΠΙΛΑΤΟΣ, ΦΑΡΕΙΣΑΙΟΙ instead of ΦΑΡΙΣΑΙΟΙ, etc.|$|E
5|$|In {{cases where}} there was {{unconscious}} guilt associated with the relationship, the wish for reunion may be subverted by anxiety. This may lead to repression, which Sigmund Freud had linked {{with the development of}} morbid dread. Jones surmised in this case the original wish of a (sexual) reunion may be drastically changed: desire <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> fear; love <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> sadism, and the object or loved one <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> an unknown entity. The sexual aspect {{may or may not be}} present. Some modern critics have proposed a simpler theory: People identify with immortal vampires because, by so doing, they overcome, or at least temporarily escape from, their fear of dying.|$|E

5|$|Chris Boucher's five Star Cops scripts {{have been}} semi-professionally {{published}} {{in two volumes}} by Judith Proctor. The first volume An Instinct for Murder was adapted from the first Star Cops episode of the same name. The second volume Little Green Men and Other Stories included the four remaining Boucher scripts. There are some changes from the broadcast episodes – neither the characters of Alexander Krivenko nor Anna Shoun appear in these books. Krivenko <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a Chinese character, Jiang Li Ho, {{as an attempt to}} update the Star Cops universe to reflect the ending of the Cold War in 1989. Shoun <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> an Irish character, Dana Cogill – Boucher didn't own the rights to use the Shoun character who had been created by John Collee.|$|E
5|$|In the Balkan Peninsula, Potamon fluviatile {{is known}} to occur in Croatia, Montenegro, the Republic of Macedonia, Albania and Greece.

5|$|All three stable {{elements}} {{occur in}} heavy mineral sands ore deposits, which are placer deposits formed, most usually in beach environments, by concentration {{due to the}} specific gravity of the mineral grains of erosion material from mafic and ultramafic rock. The titanium minerals are mostly anatase and rutile, and zirconium occurs in the mineral zircon. Because of the chemical similarity, up to 5% of the zirconium in zircon <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> hafnium. The largest producers of the group 4 elements are Australia, South Africa and Canada.|$|E

5|$|Birth {{usually takes}} place in the water and {{typically}} produces a single pup weighing 1.4 to 2.3kg (3 to 5lb). Twins occur in 2% of births; however, usually only one pup survives. At birth, the eyes are open, ten teeth are visible, and the pup has a thick coat of baby fur. Mothers have been observed to lick and fluff a newborn for hours; after grooming, the pup's fur retains so much air, the pup floats like a cork and cannot dive. The fluffy baby fur <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> adult fur after about 13 weeks.|$|E
5|$|CMDCM {{insignia}} {{are similar}} to the insignia for Master Chief, except that the rating symbol <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> an inverted five-point star, reflecting a change in their rating from their previous rating (i.e., MMCM) to CMDCM. The stars for Command Master Chief are silver, while stars for Fleet or Force Master Chief are gold. Additionally, CMDCMs wear a badge, worn on their left breast pocket, denoting their title (Command/Fleet/Force).|$|E
5|$|During the {{construction}} of the James Bay transmission system, the cross-rope suspension tower was invented. This type of tower features two guyed-tower legs similar to the V-guyed tower, but the two legs don't converge at the tower base. In the case of the cross-rope suspension tower, the tower legs are spread apart on two different foundations. In addition, the crossbar <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a series of suspension cables with three vertical insulator strings to support the three bundles, which allows this design to consume only 6.3 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line. The design is also known as the Chainette (little necklace).|$|E
50|$|In early 1994, the Red, Blue and White routes {{from the}} Frederick City Transit were discontinued. The Red Route <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> the #50, the Blue Route <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> the #40 and the White Route <b>was</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> the #60.|$|R

5|$|For surfaces, the {{generalization}} from {{the geometry of}} a plane –a flat surface– {{to that of a}} general curved surface had been described in the early 19th century by Carl Friedrich Gauss. This description had in turn been generalized to higher-dimensional spaces in a mathematical formalism introduced by Bernhard Riemann in the 1850s. With the help of Riemannian geometry, Einstein formulated a geometric description of gravity in which Minkowski's spacetime <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> distorted, curved spacetime, just as curved surfaces are a generalization of ordinary plane surfaces. Embedding Diagrams are used to illustrate curved spacetime in educational contexts.|$|E
5|$|Fragments 2 and 3, giving {{accounts}} of Jesus' baptism and temptation or transfiguration, {{spring from the}} widespread Greco-Roman myth of the descent of divine Wisdom; this underlies the parallel passages in the gospels of Matthew(11.25–30), Luke(7.18–35 and 11.49–51) and John(1.1–18), {{as well as the}} Gospel of Thomas. The differences between fragment 3 and the orthodox canonical gospels are considerable: their third-person narrative has become an account by Jesus himself, Satan <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit is identified as Jesus' mother.|$|E
5|$|Hergé {{referred}} to Müsstler's agents as the Iron Guard, thereby naming them after the real Iron Guard, a Romanian fascist group {{that sought to}} oust King Carol II and forge a Romanian-German alliance. The Bordurian officers wore uniforms based on those of the German SS, while the Bordurian planes are German in design; in the original version Tintin escapes in a Heinkel He 112, while in the revised version this <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a Messerschmitt Bf 109. Hergé adopted the basis of Borduria's false flag operation to take over Syldavia from the plans outlined in Curzio Malaparte's Tecnica del Colpo di Stato ("The Technique of a Coup d'Etat").|$|E

5|$|In {{accordance}} with {{the rules of the}} International Olympic Committee, Germany does not wear its official uniform with the logo of the German Football Association while competing at the Summer Olympics. Instead, the DFB badge <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> the coat of arms of Germany. Like all DFB squads, the women's national team is supplied by Adidas, which had provided a specifically designed female football jersey since 1999. The team's main sponsor is the German insurance company Allianz.|$|E
5|$|In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, {{also known}} as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, {{is one of the}} {{simplest}} and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.|$|E
5|$|In many people, the {{infection}} waxes and wanes. Tissue destruction and necrosis are often balanced by healing and fibrosis. Affected tissue <b>is</b> <b>replaced</b> <b>by</b> scarring and cavities filled with caseous necrotic material. During active disease, {{some of these}} cavities are joined to the air passages bronchi and this material can be coughed up. It contains living bacteria, so can spread {{the infection}}. Treatment with appropriate antibiotics kills bacteria and allows healing to take place. Upon cure, affected areas are eventually replaced by scar tissue.|$|E
