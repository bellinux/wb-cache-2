5000|$|ETCO {{released}} a technical report detailing results of comparative testing conducted at their R&D facility. This report titled “Under the Boot” was published {{after a series}} of consumer complaints, research and articles involving Coil on Plug ignition systems. There were also Technical Service Bulletins (TSBs) issued by automobile manufacturers from automotive manufacturers including Acura/Honda that caused the company to release the white paper on this research. The main focus of the research looked at the spring like connection devices. The connection devices used to supply the current's path from coil to plug were not as robust as the [...] "mated fit" [...] terminal to terminal connections required on wired ignition systems. These Coil on Plug devices do not have the retention values demanded by SAE ( [...] Society Automotive Engineers [...] ) Standard J2032 3.2.1 for High Voltage <b>Ignition</b> <b>cable</b> assemblies. Proponents of Coil on Plug technology cite cost and ease of use as primary advantages when compared to standard wire assemblies.|$|E
40|$|Copper and {{aluminum}} {{has been used}} as electrical conductor for power system transmission and distribution a long time ago. Due to higher demand of copper {{and aluminum}} in various sectors, copper and aluminum price has rose over a time and it has become a catalyst of cable theft activities. The utilities company throughout the world has lost billions of money due to cable theft activities. In this project, a carbon fiber based material known as polyester carbon coated is tested as replacement to copper and aluminum as electrical conductor. The conductor has been approved by SAE and used commercially as conductor in <b>ignition</b> <b>cable</b> for automotive sector. The main objective of this project is to study the characteristic and the current carrying capabilities of the polyester carbon coated as electrical conductor. A various type of test will be conducted on this conductor. Its include conductor resistance and resistivity, voltage drop by measurement and calculation and conductor current carrying capacity. The test that conducts meets British Standard requirement on power cable testing. The result of this project is a set of testing data which that will be analyzed in order to determine whether this conductor is suitable or not suitable to be used as conductor in power system and also a comparison of performance with existing materials...|$|E
50|$|The {{first patent}} issued was for <b>ignition</b> <b>cables,</b> citing prior art for other {{non-metallic}} conductive materials {{and their ability}} to reduce RF interference related problems. These cables consisted of a graphite/resin composite conductor strands and a protective silicone sheaf. The strands were to be twisted together and drawn through the liquid matrix material, finally being surrounded by the sheaf. The two parts would be extruded together to form the cable and ensure a well bound structure of thousands of individual graphite composite filaments.|$|R
50|$|The D.III {{featured}} a rather prominent overhead cam operating the single {{intake and exhaust}} valves, powered by a shaft running up from the crankshaft {{at the rear of}} the engine. Ignition was provided by two sets of spark plugs, one located on either side of the cylinders, each powered by a separate magneto for redundancy. The <b>ignition</b> <b>cables</b> were protected in tubes running down either side of the cylinders. Fuel was fed into the cylinders via pipes on the port side of the engine, supplied from a twin-barrel carburetor located just above the crankcase. Both the fuel and oil reservoirs were pressurized by an air compressor run off the crank.The only obvious design change from the earlier D.II was to use separate cooling jackets for each cylinder, whereas the D.II used one jacket each for a trio of adjacent pairs of cylinders. Daimler also used the pistons of the D.III to produce the reduction geared, eight-cylinder 220 hp Mercedes D.IV during this period, but it did not see widespread use. The lengthened crankshaft of the D.IV proved prone to breaking.|$|R
5|$|Despite these {{production}} {{problems and}} the fact that the I-250 had yet even to be submitted for State acceptance trails, an order had been placed for fifty more aircraft on 26 February (these aircraft have been referred to as the MiG-13, which presumably would have been their designation if they had actually entered service). A new deadline of 5 July 1946 was set for the delivery of the first pre-production aircraft, but it was stymied, again, for a lack of an engine. By this time seven airframes had been completed, but all lacked engines. The first I-250 was finally accepted on 8 August and flown for the first time three days later, although its engine seals failed and a number of <b>ignition</b> <b>cables</b> were scorched. The engine replacement and repairs forced the aircraft to miss its scheduled appearance at the Tushino Air Display. It was handed over to the NII VVS (Air Force Institute) on 15 September to finally begin its State acceptance tests. All ten aircraft had been delivered by 30 October, although construction number 3810107 (Factory No. 381, first batch, seventh aircraft) was used as a static test airframe and 3810110 became a static engine testbed.|$|R
40|$|Stand-alone {{off-grid}} {{power supply}} system is a necessity for applications when electrical power distribution network is inaccessible. Internal and external subject security aspects should be valued, and the system should be optimized to obtain properly working, never-failing and secure local electrical {{power supply system}}. Internal security aspects result from both security concept and used technologies. Internal threats contain fire <b>ignition,</b> flooding, electrical <b>cables</b> melting and other threats arising from intrinsic materials or subsystems characteristics, at standard conditions of use. Additional external aspects include anti-theft protection, breaking doors or windows signaling and countermeasure, weather extremes alert, etc. Both internal and external aspects necessarily induce additional off-grid power system or subject monitoring that might be performed by supervising security subsystem. This paper provides a solution for off-grid security subsystem. It consists from pervasive sensor circuits, fuzzy controlled diagnostics and executive actuators. Cooperated fuzzy logic diagnostic and control device enables to evaluate anticipated threats and dynamically generates the most appropriate decisions about real threat existence that leads to improvement of system protection. Proposed fuzzy rules are particularly discussed in the paper...|$|R
