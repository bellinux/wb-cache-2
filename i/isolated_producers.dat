5000|$|Following the American Civil War, the American economy {{began to}} undergo a {{dramatic}} change as smaller markets and operations were being replaced by more centralized and efficient ones. [...] This was due {{in no small part}} to the advent of the railroads, which by this time crisscrossed much of the country and connected previously <b>isolated</b> <b>producers</b> to one another in a more expedient fashion. This transformation of the nation’s transportation network by railroads had a particularly strong impact on livestock-related industries. It eliminated the need for long cattle drives [...] by connecting the producers of livestock (especially cattle) in the West with the major meat processing companies in the East. [...] It also enabled livestock markets to become transregional, with animals being shipped to large, centralized markets for sale, processing and distribution. [...] The result of this was that over time, smaller, localized markets became obsolete and {{a relatively small number of}} terminal livestock markets—markets built near important railroad centers—came to dominate the livestock and meatpacking industries. [...] St. Louis, Missouri was a natural choice as one of these locations.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was isolation, {{identification}} and characterization of bacteria of the genus Enterococcus from Duch-type semi-hard cheese during manufacture and ripening. Cheese samples from two different producers (I and II) were used at the production day and after 30, 90 and 176 days of ripening. Altogether 361 suspected enterococci isolates were obtained from cheese samples during 7 month of ripening. Using genus-specific PCR, 285 isolates were identified as the members of the genus Enterococcus. The identification of five Enterococcus species was performed by PCR using species-specific primers. Among 165 Enterococcus spp. <b>isolates</b> of <b>producer</b> I, 81 <b>isolates</b> were classified as E. faecium, 39 as E. durans, 21 as E. faecalis, 19 as E. casseliflavus and 3 as E. hirae, and 2 isolates were not classified into species. Enterococci species among <b>isolates</b> of <b>producer</b> II were as follows: 52 isolates of E. faecium, 38 of E. faecalis, 14 of E. durans, 12 of E. casseliflavus, 3 of E. hirae and 1 was not classified into species. E. faecium was found to be the dominating species in all cheese samples. The gene coding for tyrosine decarboxylase was detected in 10 enterococci <b>isolates</b> of <b>producer</b> I and in 5 enterococci <b>isolates</b> of <b>producer</b> II.

40|$|AbstractA {{cluster of}} seven human cases of {{listeriosis}} occurred in Austria and in Germany between April 2011 and July 2013. The Listeria monocytogenes serovar (SV) 1 / 2 b isolates shared {{pulsed-field gel electrophoresis}} (PFGE) and fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism (fAFLP) patterns indistinguishable from those from five food producers. The seven human isolates, a control strain with a different PFGE/fAFLP profile and ten food isolates were subjected to whole genome sequencing (WGS) in a blinded fashion. A gene-by-gene comparison (multilocus sequence typing (MLST) +) was performed, and the resulting whole genome allelic profiles were compared using SeqSphere+ software version 1. 0. On analysis of 2298 genes, the four human outbreak isolates from 2012 to 2013 had different alleles at ≤ 6 genes, i. e. differed by ≤ 6 genes from each other; the dendrogram placed these isolates in between five Austrian unaged soft cheese <b>isolates</b> from <b>producer</b> A (≤ 19 -gene difference from the human cluster) and two Austrian ready-to-eat meat <b>isolates</b> from <b>producer</b> B (≤ 8 -gene difference from the human cluster).

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to detect species of genus Aspergillus from wine grapes (berries, surface sterilized berries - {{endogenous}} mycobiota, from damaged berries and grape juice) of Slovak origin. We analyzed 20 samples of grapes, harvested in 2011 from various wine-growing regions. For the isolation of species we used the method of direct plating berries, surface-sterilized berries (using 0. 4 % freshly pre-pared chlorine), and damaged berries on DRBC (Dichloran Rose Bengal Chloramphenicol agar). For the determination of fungal contamination of grape juice, we used plate-dilution method and DRBC as medium. The cultivation in all modes of inoculation was carried at 25 ± 1 °C, for 5 to 7 days. After incubation Aspergillus isolates were inoculated on the identification media. Representatives of the genus Aspergillus were isolated from 13 samples berries, 7 samples of surface-sterilized berries, 4 samples of damaged berries and 9 samples of grape juice.

40|$|Vesicular {{stomatitis}} virus glycoprotein G-pseudotyped mouse {{retroviral vectors}} {{have been used}} as mutagens for a large-scale insertional mutagenesis screen in the zebra fish. To reproducibly generate high-titer virus stocks, we devised a method for rapidly selecting cell lines that can yield high-titer viruses and <b>isolated</b> a <b>producer</b> cell line that yields virus at a high titer on zebra fish embryos. Virus produced from this line, designated GT virus, is nontoxic following injection of zebra fish blastulae and efficiently infects embryonic cells that give rise to the future germ line. Using GT virus preparations we generated roughly 500, 000 germ line-transmissible proviral insertions in a population of 25, 000 founder fish in about 2 months. The GT virus contains a gene trap, and trap events can be detected in the offspring of almost every founder fish. We discuss potential applications of this highly efficient method for generating germ line-transmissible insertions in a vertebrat...|$|R
