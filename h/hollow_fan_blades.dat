40|$|The Shroudless, Hollow Fan Blade Technology {{program was}} {{structured}} {{to support the}} design, fabrication, and subsequent evaluation of advanced hollow and shroudless blades for the Energy Efficient Engine fan component. Rockwell International was initially selected to produce hollow airfoil specimens employing the superplastic forming/diffusion bonding (SPF/DB) fabrication technique. Rockwell demonstrated that a titanium hollow structure could be fabricated utilizing SPF/DB manufacturing methods. However, some problems such as sharp internal cavity radii and unsatisfactory secondary bonding of the edge and root details prevented production of the required quantity of fatigue test specimens. Subsequently, TRW was selected to (1) produce hollow airfoil test specimens utilizing a laminate-core/hot isostatic press/diffusion bond approach, and (2) manufacture full-size hollow prototype fan blades utilizing the technology that evolved from the specimen fabrication effort. TRW established elements of blade design and defined laminate-core/hot isostatic press/diffusion bonding fabrication techniques to produce test specimens. This fabrication technology was utilized to produce full size <b>hollow</b> <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> in which the HIP'ed parts were cambered/twisted/isothermally forged, finish machined, and delivered to Pratt & Whitney Aircraft and NASA for further evaluation...|$|E

In this work, crashworthiness under bird strike event is taken into consideration in structural optimization of <b>hollow</b> <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> together with static strength. First bird strike simulation on plate is conducted with the ALE method in ANSYS/LS-DYNA to validate the modeling algorithm {{and the effect of}} parameters variation on stress and strain result in bird material model is discussed. The effect is not obvious, so further optimization of the parameters is ignored. Bird strike simulation on solid and <b>hollow</b> <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> shows that large deformation can absorb energy and relieve direct damage to blade. At this point, hollow structure hinders large deformation of the blade, thus causes more material failure than the solid one. 3 -level orthogonal experiment is designed for 4 key geometric factors of the hollow blade structural optimization with transient strength as the objective and static strength as the constraint. For further analysis, sensitivity analysis is conducted to figure out the most important factor. Final result for the optimization design is given...|$|R

40|$|Axial fans often show adverse flow {{conditions}} at the fan hub and {{at the tip of}} the blades. In the present paper, a modification of conventional axial <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> with experimental investigation is presented. Patented hollow blades were manufactured from the hub to the trailing edge {{at the tip of the}} blades. They enable the formation of self-induced internal flow through internal passages. The internal flow enters the internal radial flow passages of the hollow blades through the openings near the fan hub and exits through the trailing edge slots at the tip of the blade. The influence of internal flow on the flow field of axial fan and the modifications of aerodynamic characteristics of the axial fan have been studied along with recent patents. An experimental investigation of the interaction of two flows with the flow around hollow airfoil NACA series in a low-speed wind tunnel was studied. The determination of flow structure on the hollow airfoil was performed with computer-aided visualization. With the introduction of the internal flow and interaction with the external flow, a reduction of circulation effects on the <b>fan</b> <b>hollow</b> <b>blade</b> was achieved. The introduction of self-induced blowing led to the preservation of the direction of external flow, defined by blade geometry, and enabled maximal local energy conversion.

For the entire engine and all its components, a cycle model was established in order to derive realistic operating conditions for all components. The model was validated against experimental data taken by the Electronic Engine Control (EEC) at the aircrafts last shop visit at Lufthansa Technik. Furthermore the engines nacelle and major fan components including its disk, casing, Outlet Guide Vanes (OGV) and Booster-Inlet Guide Vanes (IGV) etc. were optically scanned and transferred to surfaced based CAD models in a reverse engineering approach to obtain the geometry in a most accurate manner. This allowed for dedicated CFD studies of the fan itself and by including the nacelle its interaction with ground induced inlet distortions at realistic engine operating conditions as being derived from the cycle analysis. A mechanical model of the <b>hollow,</b> honeycomb structured <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> was set up {{based on the information}} from computer tomography (CT) scans of one blade and corresponding experimental determination of the blades Eigen-Frequencies.

40|$|Superplasticity {{is vital}} in many {{industries}} - medical, defense, aerospace, transport and sports amongst others [...] for the {{fabrication of metallic}} components of complex geometry. The inherent peculiarity of the effect has kept theorists fascinated for many years. But significant controversy exists concerning the exact deformation mechanisms which are operative. In particular, precise details of the accommodation mechanics - whether those are diffusion, dislocation-accommodated, {{a combination of both}} or some sort of cooperative grain boundary sliding - are still matter of debate. In this thesis, superplasticity is first experimentally studied under constant strain-rate tensile conditions; this has allowed the regime of superplasticity to be pinpointed and it forms the basis of the computational material model. In addition, a method for the rapid quantification of superplastic properties using sub-scale specimens is presented: the approach is validated and then applied to a series of different titanium alloys. Results allowed to assess critically the main factors influencing superplasticity in titanium alloys. For the elucidation of the accommodation mechanisms accompanying grain boundary sliding during superplasticity, surface observations are carried out. For this, an in-situ scanning electron microscope testing module is employed. Different regimes of the phenomenon in the Ti- 6 Al- 4 V alloy are targeted: results provided important details of the mechanics at the grain level. For design purposes, this understanding is translated into validated material laws which are accurate and which capture the relevant phenomena. Microstructurally explicit material laws are proposed based upon the micromechanical modes of deformation which are shown to be operating with aim of incorporating those into the finite element analysis of superplastic forming. In the final part of the thesis, modelling is used to simulate an industrially-relevant manufacturing process which exploits superplasticity: the construction of <b>hollow</b> wide-chord <b>fan</b> <b>blades</b> which are of significant importance for the aerospace sector. The modelling is used to highlight the importance of microstructurally-based models and their influence on processing optimisation. </p...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Aerodynamic shape {{optimization}} involves {{designing the}} most efficient shapes of bodies that move through fluids. An optimization algorithm perturbs {{the shape of an}} airfoil until it finds the shape which best exhibits a given design objective. For an inverse design technique, this objective is a prescribed aerodynamic distribution, usually the surface pressure distribution. Liebeck pressure distributions [1], for example, have been demonstrated to generate airfoils with high lift to drag ratios. When designing fans, consideration must be given not only to the shape of the <b>fan</b> <b>blades,</b> but also to the distance separating the <b>fan</b> <b>blades.</b> This spacing is defined by the pitch/chord ratio t/l, where the pitch, t, is the distance between <b>fan</b> <b>blades,</b> and the chord, l, is the length of each <b>fan</b> <b>blade.</b> In this work, an inverse algorithm is developed, then used to design <b>fan</b> <b>blade</b> shapes and to find the optimal blade spacing. <F 14. 3...|$|R
