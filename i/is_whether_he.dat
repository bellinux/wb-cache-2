Abdi-Heba himself notes that he holds his {{position}} not through his parental lineage but by the grace of Pharaoh, but this might be flattery rather than an accurate representation of the situation. At this time the area he administered from his garrison may have had a population of fifteen hundred people and Jerusalem would have been a 'small highlands stronghold' in the fourteenth century BC with no fortifications or large buildings.|$|E
25|$|During the 7th and 8th centuries, the Khazars {{fought a}} series of wars against the Umayyad Caliphate and its Abbasid successor. The First Arab-Khazar War began during {{the first phase of}} Muslim expansion. By 640, Muslim forces had reached Armenia; in 642 they {{launched}} their first raid across the Caucasus under Abd ar-Rahman ibn Rabiah. In 652 Arab forces advanced on the Khazar capital, Balanjar, but were defeated, suffering heavy losses; according to Persian historians such as al-Tabari, both sides in the battle used catapults against the opposing troops. A number of Russian sources give the name of a Khazar khagan from this period as Irbis and describe him as a scion of the Göktürk royal house, the Ashina. Whether Irbis ever existed is open to debate, as <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> can be identified with one of the many Göktürk rulers of the same name.|$|E

We will therefore conclude that it is granted on all hands he hath. The question then <b>is,</b> <b>Whether</b> <b>he</b> hath exercised that power to the demolishing or removing of the Jews' seventh day, and establishing another in its room? The which I think is easily answered, in {{that he did not}} rest from his own works therein, but chose, for his own rest, to himself another day.|$|E

The whole recollection of that time of my life has such a peculiar quality that {{the beginning and the end}} of it are merged in one sensation of profound emotion, continuous and overpowering, containing the extremes of exultation, full of careless joy and of an invincible sadness—like a day-dream. The sense of all this having been gone through as if in one great rush of imagination is all the stronger in the distance of time, because it had something of that quality even then: of fate unprovoked, of events that didn’t cast any shadow before.|$|E

60|$|I {{trust the}} {{principle}} which I have been attempting to enforce, is fully before the reader's mind, namely, that moral and religious instruction in a school, {{being in a}} great degree extra-official, in its nature, must be carried no farther than the teacher can go with the common consent, either expressed or implied, {{of those who have}} founded, and who support his school. Of course, if those founders forbid it altogether, {{they have a right to}} do so, and the teacher must submit. The only question that can justly arise, <b>is,</b> <b>whether,</b> <b>he</b> will remain in such a situation, or seek employment, where a door of usefulness, here closed against him, will be opened. While he remains, he must honestly and fully submit to the wishes of those, in whose hands Providence has placed the ultimate responsibility of training up the children of his school. It is only for a partial and specific purpose, that they are placed under his care.|$|E
60|$|The simple {{observance}} of this rule would {{put an end}} to nearly all disputes, and keep a large number of men in healthy work, who now totally waste their lives; so that the most important question that an artist can possibly have to determine for himself, <b>is</b> <b>whether</b> <b>he</b> has invention or not. And this he can ascertain with ease. If visions of unreal things present themselves to him with or without his own will, praying to be painted, quite ungovernable in their coming or going,--neither to be summoned if they do not choose to come, nor banished if they do,--he has invention. If, on the contrary, he only sees the commonly visible facts; and, should he not like them, and want to alter them, finds that he must think of a rule whereby to do so, he has no invention. All the rules in the world will do him no good; and if he tries to draw anything else than those materially visible facts, he will pass his whole life in uselessness, and produce nothing but scientific absurdities.|$|E
