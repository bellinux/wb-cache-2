25|$|The focus spread {{is related}} to the depth of focus. Ray (2000, 56) gives two {{definitions}} of the latter. The first is the tolerance of the position of the image plane for which an object remains acceptably sharp; the second is that the limits of depth of focus are the <b>image-side</b> conjugates of the near and far limits of DOF. With the first definition, focus spread and depth of focus are usually close in value though conceptually different. With the second definition, focus spread and depth of focus are the same.|$|E

50|$|An image-space (or <b>image-side)</b> {{telecentric}} lens produces {{images of}} the same size regardless of the distance between the lens and the film or image sensor. This allows the lens to be focused to different distances without changing the size of the image. Image-space telecentric lenses have an exit pupil infinitely far in front of the lens; that is, if one looks {{in the back of the}} lens, the image of the aperture is very far away.|$|E
50|$|Depth {{of focus}} can have two {{slightly}} different meanings. The {{first is the}} distance over which the image plane can be displaced while a single object plane remains in acceptably sharp focus;12 {{the second is the}} <b>image-side</b> conjugate of depth of field.2 With the first meaning, the depth of focus is symmetrical about the image plane; with the second, the depth of focus is greater {{on the far side of}} the image plane, though in most cases the distances are approximately equal.|$|E

5000|$|The -number {{describes}} the light-gathering {{ability of the}} lens in the case where the marginal rays on the object side are parallel to the axis of the lens. This case is commonly encountered in photography, where objects being photographed are often far from the camera. When the object is not distant from the lens, however, the image is no longer formed in the lens's focal plane, and the -number no longer accurately {{describes the}} light-gathering ability of the lens or the <b>image-side</b> numerical aperture. In this case, the numerical aperture is related to what is sometimes called the [...] "working -number" [...] or [...] "effective -number".|$|E

40|$|A new {{generation}} of 0. 3 numerical aperture prototype EUV optical systems is now being produced to {{provide an opportunity for}} early learning at 20 -nm feature size. Achieving diffraction limited performance from these two-mirror, annular projection optics poses a challenge for every aspect of the fabrication process, including final alignment and interferometric qualification. A new phase-shifting point diffraction interferometer will be used at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory for the measurement and alignment of the MET optic at EUV wavelengths. Using the previous generation of prototype EUV optical systems developed for lithography research, with numerical apertures up to 0. 1, EUV interferometers have demonstrated RMS accuracy levels in the 40 – 70 pm range. Relative to the previous generation of prototype EUV optics, the threefold increase to 0. 3 NA in the <b>image-side</b> numerical aperture presents several challenges for the extension of ultra-high-accuracy.

40|$|Optical {{lithography}} {{is being}} pushed into a regime of extreme-numerical aperture (extreme-NA). The {{implications of the}} nonscalar effects of high-NA lithography (above 0. 50) have been discussed now for many years 1. This paper considers the consequences of imaging at numerical apertures above 0. 70 with the oblique imaging angles required for low k 1 lithography. A new scaling factor, kNA, is introduced to capture the impact of low k 1 imaging combined with extreme- NA optics. Extreme-imaging is defined as k 1 and kNA values approach 0. 25. Polarization effects combined with resist requirements for extreme-NA are addressed, especially {{as they relate to}} 157 nm lithography. As these technologies are pursued, careful consideration of optical and resist parameters is needed. Conventional targets for resist index, absorption, diffusion, and reflectivity based on normal incidence imaging may not lead to optimum performance without these considerations. Additionally, methods of local and semi-local mask polarization are discussed using concepts of wire-grid polarizer arrays. Back-side and <b>image-side</b> polarization OPC methods are introduced...|$|E
