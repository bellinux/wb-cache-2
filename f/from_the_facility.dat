5|$|On 17 December 2001, 46 Greenpeace activists {{occupied}} the Lucas Heights facility {{to protest the}} construction of a second research reactor. Protestors gained access to the grounds, the HIFAR reactor, the high-level radioactive waste store and the radio tower.

5|$|Conner {{alleged that}} Patton {{arranged}} regulatory favors for {{the nursing home}} while the affair was ongoing. Two months after Conner said she ended the affair, Birchtree Healthcare was cited by state regulators for numerous violations of health and safety rules. By July 2002, the state had pulled all Medicare and Medicaid payments <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>facility,</b> which soon went bankrupt. Conner further alleged that the state investigation of Birchtree was retaliation by Patton for her ending of the affair.|$|E

Trevelyan is shot, but Bond escapes <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>facility</b> as it explodes. Nine years later, Bond witnesses the theft by criminal organisation Janus of a prototype Eurocopter Tiger helicopter that can withstand an electromagnetic pulse. Janus uses the helicopter {{to steal the}} control disk for the dual GoldenEye satellite weapons, using the GoldenEye to destroy the complex with an electromagnetic pulse; there are two survivors of the attack, a programmer, Natalya Simonova, and Boris Grishenko.|$|E

The local populace finds Mjolnir, which S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson soon commandeers before forcibly acquiring Jane's {{data about the}} wormhole that delivered Thor to Earth. Thor, having discovered Mjolnir's nearby location, seeks to retrieve it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>facility</b> that S.H.I.E.L.D. quickly constructed but he finds himself unable to lift it, and is captured. With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Jane.|$|E
5|$|At around 11:00pm on 6 February 1965, about 300 Viet Cong {{soldiers}} of the 30th Company assembled at their positions outside Camp Holloway, where they began breaking through the wire fences. However, the Viet Cong's mission nearly turned into a disaster when their combat engineers accidentally tripped an electrical wire after breaking through the third fence barrier, but the U.S. Military Police patrolling the area did not detect it. At 1:50am on 7 February 1965, the Viet Cong attackers opened fire with their AK-47 rifles, having successfully penetrated Camp Holloway. Shortly afterwards, the Viet Cong mortared the airfield and the U.S. advisory compound, while the sections of the 30th Company attacked their respective targets with small arms fire. About five minutes later, the Viet Cong began retreating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>facility.</b> Later that morning the Viet Cong claimed victory, having caused the death of eight U.S. soldiers, and another 126 wounded. In addition, ten aircraft were destroyed and 15 more were damaged.|$|E
5|$|The TSQ-81 antenna only {{received}} {{minor damage}} during the attack, and the U.S. suffered no casualties. However, the only 105mm howitzer {{operated by the}} Hmongs received a direct hit, and was rendered ineffective. At around 20:20, Sullivan gave the U.S. commander at Lima Site 85 the authority to direct air strikes against targets on the lower slopes of the mountain, {{on the basis that}} the situation had become critical. About 20 minutes later, the 33-man North Vietnamese platoon began climbing up towards the U.S. facility at Lima Site 85. At 21:15 Sullivan considering evacuating all U.S. personnel <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>facility</b> at first light. However, officers of the Seventh Air Force contacted the U.S. Embassy in Laos and indicated that evacuation should only occur as the last resort, when the situation on top of Phou Pha Thu was no longer under their control.|$|E

5|$|With {{the help}} of an Egyptian agent, the CIA had {{obtained}} a sample of soil <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>facility</b> taken in December 1997 showing the presence of O-Ethyl methylphosphonothioic acid (EMPTA), a substance used in the production of VX nerve gas, at 2.5 times trace levels. (Reports are contradictory on whether the soil was obtained from within the compound itself, or outside.) The collected soil was split into three samples, which were then analyzed by a private laboratory. The agent's bona fides were later confirmed through polygraph testing; however, the CIA produced a report on Al-Shifa on July 24, 1998, questioning whether Al-Shifa produced chemical weapons or simply stored precursors, and the agency advised collecting more soil samples. Cohen and Tenet later briefed U.S. senators on intercepted telephone communications from the plant that reputedly bolstered the American case against Al-Shifa. U.S. intelligence also purportedly researched the Al-Shifa factory online and searched commercial databases, but did not find any medicines for sale.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{facility}} location problems with pos/neg weights in trees. We consider two different objective functions which model {{two different ways}} to handle obnoxious facilities. If we minimize the overall sum of the minimum weighted distances of <b>the</b> vertices <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>facilities,</b> <b>the</b> optimal solution has nice combinatorial properties, e. g., vertex optimality. These properties can be exploited to derive an O(n²) algorithm for trees, an O(n log n) algorithm for stars and a linear algorithm for paths, for the pos/neg 2 -median problem on a network with n vertices. For the p-median problem with pos/neg weights on a path we give an O(pn²) algorithm. If we minimize the overall sum of the weighted minimum distances of <b>the</b> vertices <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>facilities,</b> we can show that there exist a finite set of O(n³) points in the tree which contains <b>the</b> locations of <b>facilities</b> in an optimal solution. This leads to an O(n³) algorithm for finding the optimum 2 -medians in a tree. T [...] ...|$|R

25|$|Regarding the IAEA report, several {{news reports}} {{suggested}} that Iran {{had failed to}} properly report the amount of low-enriched uranium it possessed because Iranian estimates did not match the IAEA inspector's findings, and that Iran now had enough uranium to make a nuclear bomb. The reporting was widely criticized as unjustifiably provocative and hyped. In response to the controversy, IAEA spokesman Melissa Fleming asserted that the IAEA had {{no reason at all}} to believe that the estimates of low-enriched uranium produced by Iran were an intentional error, and that no nuclear material could be removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>facility</b> for further enrichment to make nuclear weapons without the agency's knowledge since the facility is subject to video surveillance and the nuclear material is kept under seal.|$|E
25|$|Few {{strong motion}} {{seismometer}} installations were present {{outside of the}} western United States prior to the San Fernando earthquake but, upon a recommendation by the Earthquake and Wind Forces Committee, the Veterans Administration entered into {{an agreement with the}} Seismological Field Service (then associated with NOAA) to install the instruments at all VA sites in Uniform Building Code zones two and three. It had been established that these zones had a higher likelihood of experiencing strong ground acceleration, and the plan was made to furnish the selected VA hospitals with two instruments. One unit would be installed within the structure and the second would be set up as a free-field unit located a short distance away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>facility.</b> As of 1973, a few of the highest risk (26 were completed in zone 3 alone) sites that had been completed were in Seattle, Memphis, Charleston, and Boston.|$|E
