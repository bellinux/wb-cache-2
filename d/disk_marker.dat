40|$|A {{geodetic}} control {{point is a}} monumented or otherwise marked, survey point, established {{for the purpose of}} providing geodetic reference for mapping and charting activities and {{for a wide variety of}} engineering and scientific applications. A control point is normally identified by a number, an alphanumeric symbol, or a concise, intelligible name which is usually stamped on the <b>disk</b> <b>marker.</b> In principle, the designation by which a control point is identified should closely resemble the stamping that appears on the respective marker. However, extraneous information is frequently present which should not be included as part of the designation. In every case, the designation assigned to a control point for processing purposes must be identical to the designation that appears in the heading of the station description. These guidelines have been established to provide consistent control point designations and facilitate automated processing of the data. Implementation of these guidelines may sometimes result in two or more control points having the same designation. In such cases it will be necessary to refer to othe...|$|E
5000|$|Low-level {{formatting}} (i.e., {{closest to}} the hardware) marks the surfaces of the <b>disks</b> with <b>markers</b> indicating {{the start of a}} recording block (typically today called sector markers) and other information like block CRC to be used later, in normal operations, by the disk controller to read or write data. This is intended to be the permanent foundation of the disk, and is often completed at the factory.|$|R
5000|$|The use {{of other}} small <b>disks</b> as such <b>markers</b> led to the {{alternative}} term [...] "button". Silver dollars were later used as markers {{and it has been}} suggested that this is the origin of [...] "buck" [...] as a slang term for [...] "dollar," [...] though by no means is there universal agreement on this subject. The marker is also referred to as [...] "the hat". The origin of this term is believed to stem from the wearing of a hat having been used to denote dealership.|$|R

The box insert has a spinner board {{and other parts}} include playing cards, tokens, and <b>marker</b> <b>disks.</b> The second game is The Time Tunnel: Spin-To-Win, a 1967 boxed board game from Pressman Toys, which features a box insert playing board that has a tunnel-like design representing different past years in history and plastic tops are spun on the playing board to determine [...] "Time Travels." ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract An {{innovative}} and simple microfabrication method for digital microfluidics is presented. In this method, devices are formed from copper substrates or gold compact <b>disks</b> using rapid <b>marker</b> masking to replace photolithography. The new method {{is capable of}} forming devices with inter-electrode gaps as small as 50 lm. Sar-anTM wrap (polyethylene film) and commercial water re-pellants were used as dielectric and hydrophobic coatings, respectively, to replace commonly used and more expen-sive materials such as parylene-C and Teflon-AF. Devices formed by the new method enabled single- and two-plate actuation of droplets with volumes of 1 â€“ 12 lL. Fabricated devices were successfully tested for droplet manipulation, merging and splitting. We anticipate that this fabrication method will bring digital microfluidics within the reach of any laboratory with minimal facilities...|$|R
