5000|$|While oxygen {{is a very}} <b>strong</b> <b>oxidant,</b> it's {{elemental}} form [...] is {{not very}} soluble in water.

30|$|The {{synthesized}} inorganic–organic nanocomposite membrane {{was also}} tested for chemical resistance in acidic, alkaline and <b>strong</b> <b>oxidant</b> media. In acidic (1  M H 2 SO 4) and alkaline (1  M NaOH) media, few considerable changes were observed after 24, 48 and 168  h, {{indicating that the}} membrane is effective in such media. In <b>strong</b> <b>oxidant</b> media like K 2 Cr 2 O 7, however, the synthesized membrane became fragile after 48  h, losing its mechanical resistance.|$|R
50|$|Almost all {{molecules}} {{encountered in}} daily life exist in a singlet state, but molecular oxygen is an exception. At room temperature, O2 exists in a triplet state, which can only undergo a chemical reaction by making the forbidden transition into a singlet state. This makes it kinetically nonreactive despite being thermodynamically a <b>strong</b> <b>oxidant.</b> Photochemical or thermal activation can bring it into the singlet state, which makes it kinetically as well as thermodynamically a <b>strong</b> <b>oxidant.</b>|$|R

50|$|Compounds of lead {{exist in}} two main {{oxidation}} states: +2 and +4. The former is more common. Inorganic lead(IV) compounds are typically <b>strong</b> <b>oxidants</b> or exist only in highly acidic solutions.|$|R
5000|$|Typical <b>strong</b> <b>oxidants</b> (source of [...] "O" [...] in {{the above}} reaction) include {{potassium}} permanganate or a Cr(VI) compound. Milder conditions {{make use of the}} Dess-Martin periodinane or the Moffatt-Swern methods.|$|R

30|$|The {{thiophene}} ring system, unless carrying electron-donating substituents, {{is relatively}} stable to atmospheric oxidation [59], and resist {{the action of}} moderate oxidizing agents [42, 43]. Oxygen and peracids are known to preferentially attack the sulfur atom [43], while <b>stronger</b> <b>oxidants</b> are required to actually attack the aromatic carbons. Ozone, for example, attacks the double bond between the aromatic carbons which results in the cleavage of the ring; thus, oxidation of benzothiophene with ozone yields o-mercaptobenzaldehydae [59]. Similarly, <b>strong</b> <b>oxidants,</b> e.g., nitric acid, are able {{to break down the}} aromatic ring to give maleic and oxalic acids, while the ring sulfur is oxidized to sulfuric acid [59].|$|R
