[...] Nikola Tesla is finally beginning to attract real attention and encourage serious debate nearly 70 years after his death. Nikola Tesla, Serbian-American scientist, the man who lit the world, gave his greatest contribution to science and technological progress of the world as the inventor of the rotating magnetic field and of the complete system of production and <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> (motors, generators) based on the use of alternate currents. His name was given to the SI unit for magnetic induction ("tesla"). Tesla also constructed the generators of high-frequency alternate currents and high-voltage coreless transformer known today as [...] "Tesla Coil". Sanja has managed to bring to life moments of Tesla's life that the public had yet to see and displayed important moments and sequences of Tesla's life, which for mysterious reasons have remained a well kept secret to date. Tesla whom we might have referred to as holy, sacred, died before he was recognized as someone who truly marked the history of mankind.

Due to the delays in the adaptation of changes, supply chains can be dynamically unstable with respect to perturbations in the consumption rate. It can lead to stock-outs, large and expensive capacity utilisation swings, lower quality products, and considerable production/transport on-costs as deliveries are ramped up and down at the whim of the supply chain. The {{first part of the}} paper presents the bullwhip-effect in the conventional logistics systems.
