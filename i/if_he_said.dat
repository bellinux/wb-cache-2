500|$|However, Anderson {{conceded that}} Grade [...] "was {{not a man}} you could argue with. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> [...] "No", you had to accept that he wouldn't change his mind." [...] Of Grade's decision, La Rivière conjectures, [...] "No one knows what was running through [...] mind ... but given {{the ease with which}} the 'Unwinese' element could have been removed [...] the series, it seems {{probable}} that he simply didn't like a lot of what he was seeing." [...] In a move that would lead to the discontinuation of the Supermarionation format, Anderson and Grade coordinated to transfer most of the production staff from the Century 21 base at the Slough Trading Estate in Berkshire to Pinewood Studios in Buckinghamshire for the commencement of filming on UFO, the Andersons' first full live-action series.|$|E
500|$|Since 2016, Chabon {{has been}} {{an outspoken critic of}} Donald Trump, both during his {{campaign}} for the presidency (signing a petition with over 400 other writers against his presidency in May 2016), and during his administration. During an interview with The Guardian before Trump's inauguration in January 2017, Chabon remarked of the incoming president, [...] "I really have no idea what to expect. He’s so unpredictable. He’s so mercurial. You know, I would be no more surprised if he stood up there and declared amnesty for all illegal immigrants to the United States than <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> {{he was going to take}} them all out to be shot. He’s like a random impulse generator." [...] In a 2017 radio interview, Chabon spoke of President Trump and said: “Every morning I wake up and in the seconds before I turn my phone on to see what the latest news is, I have this boundless sense of optimism and hope that this is the day that he’s going to have a massive stroke, and, you know, be carted out of the White House on a gurney." ...|$|E

500|$|Uematsu was {{personally}} {{very pleased with}} the way that the soundtrack for Final Fantasy VI turned out, and has said in interviews that he felt that [...] "with the satisfaction and excitement I felt after finishing that project, I thought I had reached my primary goal, and could quit doing game music with no regrets." [...] He stated in the liner notes for Piano Collections Final Fantasy VI that he intended the music to be emotionally moving, and entreated the listener {{not to think about the}} music, but to feel it. He also feels that the title track for Final Fantasy VI was the most challenging track he has ever made. As for Final Fantasy VI Grand Finale, on the other hand, Uematsu has said that he was [...] "not satisfied with this album at all", due to the deviation it took from his original visions for the music due to his lack of personal involvement in the arrangements. Although he did not feel that the album was a poor one, saying that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> nothing no one would ever know of his dissatisfaction, he felt that it was not what he would have created if he had [...] "defend the image of each piece".|$|E

2500|$|If the {{researcher}} displayed irritation, Alex tried to defuse {{it with the}} phrase, [...] "I'm sorry."

2500|$|After the scandal, actress Brigitte Nielsen {{came forward}} and stated that she too {{had an affair with}} Schwarzenegger while he was in a {{relationship}} with Shriver, saying, [...] "Maybe I wouldn't have got into it <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> 'I'm going to marry Maria' and this is dead serious, but he didn't, and our affair carried on."

2500|$|Doris Heffer served jointly as her husband's {{secretary}}, {{and secretary}} to fellow Labour MP Norman Buchan. She often accompanied him to speaking engagements where {{they made an}} odd couple: Heffer was both tall and heavily built, while his wife was only 4'6" [...] tall. Heffer made a good-humoured complaint when political journalist Andrew Roth described Doris as [...] "tiny", insisting that she was actually [...] "petite". According to the diaries of Giles Radice, Doris Heffer {{would sit in the}} front row of the audience when Heffer was speaking, saying, [...] "Nonsense, Eric" [...] <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> something with which she disagreed. The Heffers had no children.|$|E

2500|$|Hume's {{religious}} views were often suspect. It was {{necessary in the}} 1750s for his friends to avert a trial against him on the charge of heresy. However, he [...] "would not have come {{and could not be}} forced to attend <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> he was {{not a member of the}} Established Church". Hume failed to gain the chair of philosophy at the University of Glasgow for his {{religious views}}, too. He had published the Philosophical Essays by this time which were decidedly anti-religious. Even Adam Smith, his personal friend who had vacated the Glasgow philosophy chair, was against his appointment out of concern public opinion would be against it.|$|E
2500|$|Cousins {{notes of}} Bower that 'a very {{clear sense of}} his rigid code of honour is plain, and a {{conviction}} that not only unity, peace and happiness in South Africa, but also the peace of Europe would be endangered if he told the truth. He believed that, as he had given Rhodes his word not to divulge certain private conversations, he had to abide by that, {{while at the same}} time he was convinced that it would be very damaging to Britain <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> anything to the parliamentary committee to show the close involvement of Sir Hercules Robinson and Joseph Chamberlain in their disreputable encouragement of those plotting an uprising in Johannesburg.' ...|$|E
2500|$|... ' no more justifiable insurrection had, in his judgement, {{taken place}} {{in the history of the}} world than the Irish {{rebellion}} of a hundred years ago. A rebel was a patriot who failed – a patriot was a rebel who succeeded, and he thought he did not misinterpret the spirit of that assembly <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> they were ready to toast the men of '98 in either capacity. He should never cease to be grateful to the United Irishmen, not only because they had bequeathed an example of courageous patriotism, but because they had given them one cardinal principle of high policy, and that was the principle of a united Ireland. He trusted that this memorable year would not be allowed to pass away without renewed efforts being made to restore union in the National Union, at present so unhappily divided.' ...|$|E

2500|$|In late 1970, at age 65, {{urged by}} the Abbot of the Abbey of Hauterive and Dominican theologian Father Marie-Dominique Philippe {{to teach the}} seminarians personally, Lefebvre, feeling too old to {{undertake}} such a large project, told them he would visit François Charrière, Bishop of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg, with a request {{to set up a}} religious society. He told them, <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> to go through with it, he would see in it a sign of Divine Providence. Charrière granted Lefebvre's request and, with a document predated by six days to 1 November 1970, he established the Society of St. Pius X as a pia unio (Latin, for [...] "pious, or holy, union") on a provisional (ad experimentum) basis for six years. Pia unio status was the first stage through which a Catholic organisation passed prior to gaining official recognition as a religious institute or society of apostolic life. (Since 1983, the term [...] "association of the faithful" [...] has replaced [...] "pia unio".) The Society of Saint Pius X was formally founded, adhering to all canonical norms, and receiving the episcopal blessing and encouragement of the local ordinary. Some Swiss laymen offered the seminary at Ecône to the newly formed group, and in 1971 the first 24 candidates entered, followed by a further 32 in October 1972.|$|E
6000|$|It was {{a fearful}} crisis for Tito. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Yes," [...] his quick mind {{told him that}} he would shake the {{credibility}} of his story: <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>said</b> [...] "No," [...] he risked everything on the uncertain extent of Baldassarre's imbecility.
