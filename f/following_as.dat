5|$|Released in {{competition}} with Half-Life 2 and several other titles, Bloodlines sold fewer than 80,000 copies during its initial release, which was considered a poor performance. It divided critics at the time; although they praised the game's writing and scale of choice, they criticized its technical flaws. It was Troika Games' last production before its failure in early 2005, when it was unable to secure additional projects. The game has a cult <b>following</b> <b>as</b> a rarely replicated example of gameplay and narrative, and contemporary reception recognised it as a flawed masterpiece. Since its original release in 2004, Bloodlines received post-release support from fans, supplying unofficial fixes and re-adding unused content.|$|E

5|$|Though a {{few small}} factions broke with Smith's {{organization}} during his lifetime, he retained the allegiance {{of the vast majority}} of Latter Day Saints until his death in June 1844. Following Smith's death, the movement experienced a leadership crisis which led to a schism within the church. The largest group, which would become the LDS Church, followed Brigham Young, settling in what would become the Utah Territory. The second-largest faction, the RLDS Church, coalesced around Joseph Smith III, eldest son of Joseph Smith. Other would-be leaders included the senior surviving member of the First Presidency, Sidney Rigdon; the newly baptized James Strang from Wisconsin; and Alpheus Cutler, one of the Council of Fifty. Each of these men still retains a <b>following</b> <b>as</b> of 2014—however tiny it may be in some cases—and all of their organizations have experienced further schisms. Other claimants, such as Granville Hedrick, William Bickerton and Charles B. Thompson, later emerged to start still other factions, some of which have further subdivided.|$|E
