5|$|After the {{location}} filming, production {{went back to}} soundstages for interiors. Some scenes were shot against a green screen background for second unit footage of other locations to be substituted, allowing the use of crane shots. With the photography done, Moore took the film to South Korea to <b>edit</b> <b>to</b> prevent Disney from finding out; he also refused to tell most of his close friends what he was doing. Visual effects were done by the same company there that had done them for the 2006 South Korean monster film, The Host.|$|E
25|$|A {{decision}} {{is taken to}} publish a work, and the technical legal issues resolved, the author {{may be asked to}} improve the quality of the work through rewriting or smaller changes and the staff will edit the work. Publishers may maintain a house style, and staff will copy <b>edit</b> <b>to</b> ensure that the work matches the style and grammatical requirements of each market. Editors often choose or refine titles and headlines. Editing may also involve structural changes and requests for more information. Some publishers employ fact checkers, particularly regarding non-fiction works.|$|E

From 2003 to 2007, 170 edits were made, a large proportion of which focused on Scientologist views critical of psychiatry. The article [...] "Kurt Cobain" [...] was edited by Scientologists in order to include a link to the Scientology-founded [...] "Citizens Commission on Human Rights" [...] (CCHR); and an <b>edit</b> <b>to</b> the article put forth the notion that, [...] "the singer's childhood Ritalin prescription led him to suicide". Multiple edits involved adding links to webpages of organizations affiliated with Scientology.|$|E

500|$|John Adams {{persuaded the}} {{committee}} to select Thomas Jefferson to compose the original draft of the document, which Congress would <b>edit</b> <b>to</b> produce the final version. The Declaration was ultimately a formal explanation of why Congress had voted on July 2 to declare independence from Great Britain, {{more than a year}} after the outbreak of the American Revolutionary War. [...] The next day, Adams wrote to his wife Abigail: [...] "The Second Day of July 1776, will be the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America." [...] But Independence Day is actually celebrated on July 4, the date that the Declaration of Independence was approved.|$|E
500|$|... "Love Profusion" [...] {{is a song}} by American {{singer and}} {{songwriter}} Madonna for her ninth studio album American Life (2003). Written and produced by Madonna and Mirwais Ahmadzaï, it was released as the fourth and final single from the album on December 8, 2003, by Maverick Records. [...] "Love Profusion" [...] was first premiered during {{the release of the}} album on AOL. It later received a number of remixes, which were also released alongside the single. The song contains rhythm from a four piece bass drum, with guitar riffs of the acoustic guitar and Madonna's voice backed by a male vocal during the chorus. Ahmadzaï used the stutter <b>edit</b> <b>to</b> create a new groove. Dedicated to Madonna's then-husband, Guy Ritchie, the song's lyrics deal with Madonna's confusion regarding American culture.|$|E
500|$|The edited {{version of}} an album will {{normally}} <b>edit</b> <b>to</b> the level in which the content would be considered appropriate for radio airplay. Strong language is almost always edited out (however the edited versions of The Marshall Mathers LP and The Slim Shady LP left in nearly all profanities other than [...] "fuck", {{with the exception of}} the album's singles in which the existing radio edits were used), in addition to racial slurs (most albums will remove [...] "nigga/nigger"). Specific drug references are also usually edited out, primarily slang terms for illegal drugs. Generally, however, some edited albums are not consistent with editing violent and sexual lyrics, as often, these lyrics are left in unedited. An example is [...] "Tomb of the Boom" [...] on the edited version of Speakerboxxx/The Love Below, which leaves in detailed lyrics about street violence (including sound effects of gunfire and police sirens) and sexual innuendos, both of which would normally be edited out, but on the other hand, all obscenities are muted.|$|E

500|$|On December 14, 2012, {{academic}} and writer Judith Reisman stated {{in a piece}} for WorldNetDaily that in her view Wales had received revenue from a website which dealt in pornography. Relatively soon after the article was published, Wales wrote to WorldNetDaily to object to this characterization: [...] "This is absolutely and categoricallly [...] false. I have never made any 'fortune', as a pornography trafficker or otherwise, and I have never been a 'pornography trafficker' at all. ... I demand an immediate <b>edit</b> <b>to</b> that story to remove the lie about me." [...] WorldNetDaily editor Joseph Farah personally replied to Wales to explain that Wikipedia's coverage {{of the history of}} Bomis acknowledged at the time that: [...] "Bomis ran a website called Bomis Premium at premium.bomis.com until 2005, offering customers access to premium, X-rated pornographic content." [...] Wales sent an email to Farah stating Wikipedia: [...] "doesn't say anything remotely like me making a 'fortune' from 'pornography." [...] Wales inquired to Farah {{what he was going to}} do next about what Wales characterized as [...] "libel". Farah responded to Wales' reply with a subsequent email asking: [...] "Let me get this straight: You admit making money from pornography, but you feel defamed because you didn’t make enough for it to be considered a 'fortune'?" [...] Wales then repeated his original request to Farah and again asserted the original article was [...] "defamatory", writing in an email: [...] "This is a defamatory falsehood. I have never made any 'fortune' as a 'porngraphy [...] trafficker.' Fix it." ...|$|E
