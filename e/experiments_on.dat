5|$|Maternal {{deprivation}} <b>experiments</b> <b>on</b> nonhuman primates {{have continued}} into the 21st century and remain controversial. Stephen Suomi, an early collaborator of Harlow, has continued to conduct maternal deprivation <b>experiments</b> <b>on</b> rhesus monkeys in his NIH laboratory and has been vigorously criticized by PETA, Members of Congress and others.|$|E
5|$|A quasi-sequel, called Dr. Caligari, was {{released}} in 1989, directed by Stephen Sayadian and starring Madeleine Reynal as the granddaughter of the original Dr. Caligari, now running an asylum and performing bizarre hormonal <b>experiments</b> <b>on</b> its patients. The sex-driven story ultimately had {{little in common with}} the original film.|$|E
5|$|Governments {{such as the}} Netherlands and New Zealand {{have responded}} to the public's {{concerns}} by outlawing invasive <b>experiments</b> <b>on</b> certain classes of non-human primates, particularly the great apes. In 2015, captive chimpanzees in the U.S. were added to the Endangered Species Act adding new road blocks to those wishing to experiment on them. Similarly, citing ethical considerations and the availability of alternative research methods, the U.S. NIH announced in 2013 that it would dramatically reduce and eventually phase out <b>experiments</b> <b>on</b> chimpanzees.|$|E

50|$|To empirically {{determine}} the Reynolds number dependence, instead of <b>experimenting</b> <b>on</b> huge bodies with fast-flowing fluids (such as real-size airplanes in wind-tunnels), one may {{just as well}} <b>experiment</b> <b>on</b> small models with more viscous and higher flow velocity, because these two systems are similar.|$|R
60|$|It is {{the very}} passions about whose origin we deceive {{ourselves}} that tyrannise most strongly over us. Our weakest motives are those of whose nature we are conscious.

5|$|LTP {{was first}} {{observed}} by Terje Lømo in 1966 in the Oslo, Norway, laboratory of Per Andersen. There, Lømo conducted {{a series of}} neurophysiological <b>experiments</b> <b>on</b> anesthetized rabbits to explore the role of the hippocampus in short-term memory.|$|E
5|$|Lavoisier {{conducted}} the first adequate quantitative <b>experiments</b> <b>on</b> oxidation {{and gave the}} first correct explanation of how combustion works.

5|$|The {{moral and}} ethical {{questions}} raised by performing <b>experiments</b> <b>on</b> animals are subject to debate, and viewpoints have shifted significantly over the 20th century. There remain disagreements about which procedures are useful for which purposes, as well as disagreements over which ethical principles apply to which species.|$|E
5|$|An {{important}} part of the crew's schedule was regular exercise. They had three pieces of equipment for this: a stationary bicycle, a treadmill (TVIS), and a resistance device (IRED) for weight-lifting. The bicycle malfunctioned in mid-December 2000, and wasn't fixed until March. The treadmill, which used bungee cords to keep the crew member in place, was designed to reduce the vibrations caused by running. A normal treadmill would have produced enough vibrations to shake the station, and potentially affect the sensitive science <b>experiments</b> <b>on</b> board. The treadmill malfunctioned near the end of February, but some in-flight maintenance fixed the problem within a week.|$|E
5|$|Better Off Ted {{revolves}} around the employees of a stereotypically evil company. The company, Veridian Dynamics, <b>experiments</b> <b>on</b> its employees, twists the truth, and will stop at nothing to achieve its goals. It has been mentioned that Veridian has swayed presidential elections, created killer pandas and robots, and weaponized pumpkins, {{and that there are}} only three governments left in the world which are more powerful than Veridian. Although not promoted as such, and rarely the focus of storylines, the show's frequent references to futuristic technologies, killer robots, sentient computers, etc., places Better Off Ted at least partially in the science fiction genre.|$|E

5|$|David Lovering (born December 6, 1961) is an American {{musician}} and magician. He {{is best known}} as the drummer for the alternative rock band Pixies, which he joined in 1986. After the band's breakup in 1993, Lovering drummed with several other acts, including The Martinis, Cracker, Nitzer Ebb and Tanya Donelly. He also pursued a magic career as The Scientific Phenomenalist; performing scientific and physics-based <b>experiments</b> <b>on</b> stage. When the Pixies reunited in 2004, Lovering returned as the band's drummer.|$|E
5|$|Elemental iodine (I2) is toxic if taken orally undiluted. The {{lethal dose}} {{for an adult}} human is 30mg/kg, which is about 2.1–2.4grams for a human {{weighing}} 70 to 80kg (even if <b>experiments</b> <b>on</b> rats demonstrated that these animals could survive after eating a 14000mg/kg dose). Excess iodine can be more cytotoxic {{in the presence of}} selenium deficiency. Iodine supplementation in selenium-deficient populations is, in theory, problematic, partly for this reason. The toxicity derives from its oxidizing properties, through which it denaturates proteins (including enzymes).|$|E
5|$|<b>Experiments</b> <b>on</b> decapitated {{specimens}} of {{several species of}} cockroach found a variety of behavioral functionality remained, including shock avoidance and escape behavior, although many insects other than cockroaches are also able to survive decapitation, and popular claims of the longevity of headless cockroaches {{do not appear to}} be based on published research. The severed head is able to survive and wave its antennae for several hours, or longer when refrigerated and given nutrients.|$|E

5|$|Extending {{the work}} of Vesalius into <b>experiments</b> <b>on</b> still living bodies (of both humans and animals), William Harvey and other natural {{philosophers}} investigated the roles of blood, veins and arteries. Harvey's De motu cordis in 1628 {{was the beginning of}} the end for Galenic theory, and alongside Santorio Santorio's studies of metabolism, it served as an influential model of quantitative approaches to physiology.|$|E
5|$|German doctors {{performed}} {{a wide variety}} of <b>experiments</b> <b>on</b> prisoners at Auschwitz. SS doctors tested the efficacy of X-rays as a sterilization device by administering large doses to female prisoners. Prof Dr Carl Clauberg injected chemicals into women's uteruses in an effort to glue them shut. Bayer, then a subsidiary of IG Farben, bought prisoners to use as research subjects for testing new drugs. Prisoners were also deliberately infected with spotted fever for vaccination research and exposed to toxic substances to study the effects.|$|E
5|$|He {{considers}} the forces such as surface tension acting on cells, and Plateau's <b>experiments</b> <b>on</b> soap films. He illustrates {{the way a}} splash breaks into droplets and compares this to the shapes of Campanularian zoophytes (Hydrozoa). He looks at the flask-like shapes of single-celled organisms such as species of Vorticella, considering teleological and physical explanations of their having minimal areas; and at the hanging drop shapes of some Foraminifera such as Lagena. He argues that the cells of trypanosomes are similarly shaped by surface tension.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, the Dubna team {{carried out}} {{chemical}} <b>experiments</b> <b>on</b> element 102 {{and concluded that}} it behaved as the heavier homologue of ytterbium.

5|$|In a 1905 paper, Einstein {{postulated}} that light itself consists of localized particles (quanta). Einstein's light quanta were nearly universally rejected by all physicists, including Max Planck and Niels Bohr. This idea only became universally accepted in 1919, with Robert Millikan's detailed <b>experiments</b> <b>on</b> the photoelectric effect, {{and with the}} measurement of Compton scattering.|$|E
5|$|In the 2nd century, Galen of Pergamum, an anatomist, clinician, {{writer and}} philosopher, wrote the final and highly {{influential}} anatomy treatise of ancient times. He compiled existing knowledge and studied anatomy through dissection of animals. He {{was one of}} the first experimental physiologists through his vivisection <b>experiments</b> <b>on</b> animals. Galen's drawings, based mostly on dog anatomy, became effectively the only anatomical textbook for the next thousand years. His work was known to Renaissance doctors only through Islamic Golden Age medicine until it was translated from the Greek some time in the 15th century.|$|E
