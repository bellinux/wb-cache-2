Historian Marguerite Wilbur called the era of Cornwallis and Mornington the Golden Age of British rule in India.|$|E
5|$|Due to the 10-second time {{bonus for}} winning the stage, Kristoff took over the overall lead of the race, one second ahead of Boonen, who moved into {{the lead of the}} points competition.

5|$|During the {{presentation}} of the teams, the riders were asked to choose their top picks <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> victory.

The main series characters were praised for being a perfect fit <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> story, {{as well as for}} their cute appearances. The characters introduced in a la Mode were also praised for their visual appearances, but criticized as being repeats of the original series.|$|E

From 1927-28 season on, the trophy was awarded to the champion of the American Division of the NHL, while the O'Brien Cup was presented to the Canadian Division champion, until 1938, when, after the NHL reverted to a single division, the Wales Trophy was made the award <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> regular season champion.|$|E

5|$|Lucien Petit-Breton {{became the}} new leader of the race. Although he had already {{finished}} in fifth place and fourth place in previous years, he was still relatively unknown, and had started in the coureurs sur machines poinçonnées category. Petit-Breton {{finished in the top}} three in the next stages, so no other cyclist was able to challenge him <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> victory. At the end of the race, he had increased his lead to a margin of 19 points ahead of Garrigou and 27 points ahead of Georget.|$|E

5|$|René Pottier, {{the winner}} of the 1906 Tour de France, did not defend his title because he had {{committed}} suicide in early 1907. Although the riders officially rode the Tour as individuals, some shared the same sponsor and cooperated as if they rode in teams. At the start of the race, it was expected that the riders sponsored by Alcyon and the riders sponsored by Peugeot would compete <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> victory. Alcyon started with three main contenders: Louis Trousselier, Marcel Cadolle and Léon Georget; Peugeot counted on Emile Georget.|$|E

For the fifteen months ending in March 2015, Clinton earned over $11million from her speeches. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> period 2007–14, the Clintons earned almost $141million, paid some $56million in federal and state taxes and donated about $15million to charity.

Though he was suspended for three months because of Oil for Drugs, he was cleared by the Italian National Olympic Committee of any wrongdoing in the 2007 Giro, and was thus permitted to start.|$|E

5|$|Any {{one-dimensional}} reversible {{cellular automaton}} may be placed into rectangular form, after which its transition rule may be factored into {{the action of}} an idempotent semicentral bigroupoid (a reversible rule for which regions of cells with a single state value change only at their boundaries) together with a permutation {{on the set of}} states. The first-order invariants for the idempotent lifting of the automaton rule (the modified rule formed by omitting the permutation) necessarily behave like the ones for a rectangular band: they have a basis of invariants that flow either leftwards or rightwards at a constant rate without interaction. The first-order invariants <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> automaton are then exactly the invariants for the idempotent lifting that give equal weight to every pair of states that belong to the same orbit of the permutation. However, the permutation of states in the rule may cause these invariants to behave differently from in the idempotent lifting, flowing non-uniformly and with interactions.|$|E
5|$|Both {{medications}} and neurorehabilitation {{have been shown}} to improve some symptoms, though neither changes the course of the disease. Some symptoms have a good response to medication, such as an unstable bladder and spasticity, while others are little changed. For neurologic problems, a multidisciplinary approach is important for improving quality of life; however, it is difficult to specify a 'core team' as many health services may be needed at different points in time. Multidisciplinary rehabilitation programs increase activity and participation of people with MS but do not influence impairment level. There is limited evidence <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>overall</b> efficacy of individual therapeutic disciplines, though there is good evidence that specific approaches, such as exercise, and psychology therapies, in particular cognitive behavioral approaches are effective.|$|E
