5|$|Although {{they had}} {{considered}} not contesting the election because {{the area was}} a Conservative stronghold, the Liberals <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{so in order to}} generate a discussion on the issue of Home Rule for Ireland. Allsopp was in agreement with the Conservative policy, which was to maintain full governmental control over Ireland, and pass further Coercion Acts to reduce lawlessness in that country. Sanders, who had lost two previous elections for the Liberal Party, was in favour of devolution of powers to Ireland.|$|E
5|$|Anna Bågenholm {{was born}} in 1970 in Vänersborg, Sweden. At {{the time of the}} incident, she was 29years old and {{studying}} to become an orthopedic surgeon. Bågenholm <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> her residency in Narvik, Norway, and, in May 1998, she became a surgeon assistant at the Narvik Hospital. Bågenholm's mentor during this period was Yngve Jones, a doctor at the Narvik Hospital who was about to celebrate his retirement with a party on 20 May 1999.|$|E

5|$|In the 1890s {{some people}} – {{including}} the young Calogero Vizzini – <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{something about the}} absence of peace and security in the countryside. The state police {{at the time was}} as much a danger as the brigands. The Villalba Mafia thus emerged as an alternative social regime centred on the membership in church-sponsored associations that generated considerable social capital. It later transformed into a protection racket, victimizing villagers and landowners alike through violence, intimidation and omertà.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the film}} began after {{production}} had finished on The Hunchback of Notre Dame (1996). Instead of another musical, the production team <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> an action-adventure film inspired by the works of Jules Verne. Atlantis was notable for adopting the distinctive visual style of comic book creator Mike Mignola. At {{the time of its}} release, the film had made greater use of computer-generated imagery (CGI) than any of Disney's previous traditionally animated features; it remains one of the few to have been shot in anamorphic format. Linguist Marc Okrand created a language specifically for use in Atlantis, with James Newton Howard providing the film's score. The film was released at a time when audience interest in animated films was shifting away from hand-drawn animation toward films with full CGI.|$|E
5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Burns and Smithers {{go down to}} the lab during Homer's nightmare. The animators decided to make the {{animation}} a bit more impressive, and <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> the concave and convex images of Burns and Smithers. Even though it was tough and took up more time, the producers felt that it was a necessary tour-de-force. Originally, Homer's robotic voice was done post-animation in order to avoid stress on the voice actor. One of the writers who created the Davy Crockett joke thought it was so funny that he actually mimicked the actions of Mr. Burns putting on Homer's brain in the writing room; the producers thought that it was hilarious, so they decided to add it into the episode.|$|E

5|$|One {{man in the}} crowd, Leon Czolgosz, {{hoped to}} assassinate McKinley. He {{had managed to get}} close to the presidential podium, but did not fire, {{uncertain}} of hitting his target. Czolgosz, since hearing a speech by anarchist Emma Goldman in Cleveland, had <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something he believed would advance the cause. After his failure to get close enough on the fifth, Czolgosz waited the next day at the Temple of Music on the Exposition grounds, where the President was to meet the public. Czolgosz concealed his gun in a handkerchief, and, when he reached the head of the line, shot McKinley twice in the abdomen.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei II was {{developed}} by Atlus for the Super Famicom. It was directed by Koji Okada, produced by Hideyuki Yokoyama, and written by Ryutaro Ito, with music composed by Tsukasa Masuko. Kazuma Kaneko designed the game's characters, but was also involved in the planning phase. During the game's pre-production, the development staff visited Hariti's temple in Zōshigaya and Taira no Masakado's grave to cleanse themselves. They had done this before, first during {{the development of the}} first Shin Megami Tensei; after one of the staff members got robbed, they <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it regularly. The inspiration to do this came from Go Nagai, who was said to have exorcised a spirit with the help of Hariti while writing the manga Devilman.|$|E
5|$|Sukumar {{was born}} on 11 January 1970, in Mattaparru, a village near Razole in the East Godavari {{district}} of Andhra Pradesh. His father Tirupathi Naidu was a rice trader and his mother Veera Veni was a homemaker. Sukumar {{was the youngest of}} the six children of Naidu and Veni. At the age of 6, following the slaughter of a rooster he loved, Sukumar began practising vegetarianism. He did his schooling from a Zilla Parishad High School, Razole and graduated with a master's degree in mathematics. He later worked as a mathematics and physics lecturer in Aditya Junior college, Kakinada. After six years, Sukumar and his junior Prakash Toleti <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something creative as they opined that their life has become too mundane as a lecturer.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{her return}} from Rome, Violante Beatrice and the Electress Anna Maria Luisa <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> {{something}} about Gian Gastone's public {{image and the}} Ruspanti, his entourage. In order to distract him from the Ruspanti, Violante Beatrice threw banquets, to which she invited the foremost members of Tuscan society. The Grand Duke's behaviour, vomiting, belching and cracking rude jokes, literally sent the guests scrambling to leave. The Electress was more fortunate for her part. She succeeded in making Gian Gastone appear on Saint John the Baptist's day, 1729. However, during the ceremony, the Grand Duke became so intoxicated {{that he had to}} be dragged back to his palace, the Pitti, on a litter.|$|E
5|$|Ellis {{attempted}} to hit every batter in the Cincinnati Reds lineup on May 1, 1974, {{as he was}} angry that the Pirates were intimidated by the Big Red Machine. Ellis admired Pete Rose and was concerned about how he would respond, but Ellis <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it regardless. Ellis hit Rose, Joe Morgan, and Dan Driessen {{in the top of}} the first inning. Cleanup batter Tony Pérez avoided Ellis' attempts and drew a walk; the first pitch to Perez was thrown behind him and over his head. Ellis threw two pitches that he aimed at the head of Johnny Bench, at which point Ellis was removed from the game by manager Danny Murtaugh. Ellis' box score for the game reads as follows: 0 IP, 0 H, 1 R, 1 ER, 1 BB, 0 K. Ellis tied eight other players for the MLB record with the three hit batsmen in the inning.|$|E
5|$|In Your Honor is {{the fifth}} studio album by American rock band Foo Fighters, {{released}} on June 14, 2005 by RCA Records. It is a double album, with one disc containing heavy rock songs and a second disc with mellower acoustic songs. Frontman Dave Grohl <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a diverse blend of songs as he felt that after ten years of existence, the band had to break new ground with their music. The album was recorded at a newly built studio in Northridge, Los Angeles, and featured guests such as John Paul Jones, Norah Jones and Josh Homme. The lyrics deal with both resonating and introspective themes, with a major influence from Grohl's involvement {{on the campaign trail}} with John Kerry during the 2004 presidential election. It is the first album to feature keyboardist Rami Jaffee, although he would not join the band as full-time member until 2017.|$|E
40|$|Frankfurt {{sets out}} to refute the {{principle}} according to which ‘a person is morally responsible for {{what he has done}} only if he could have done otherwise’. Frankfurt devises a counterexample in which an agent is intuitively responsible even though she could not have done otherwise: Suppose someone – Black, let us say – wants Jones to perform a certain action. Black is prepared to go to considerable lengths to get his way, but he prefers to avoid showing his hand unnecessarily. So he waits until Jones is about to make up his mind what <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and he does nothing unless it is clear to him that Jones is going <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something other than what he wants him <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> If it does become clear that Jones is going <b>to</b> <b>decide</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something else, Black takes effective steps to ensure that Jones <b>decides</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and that he does do, what he wants him <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> Whatever Jones's initial preferences and inclinations, then, Black will have his way … Now suppose that Black never has to show his hand because Jones, for reasons of his own, <b>decides</b> <b>to</b> perform and <b>does</b> perform the very action Black wants him to perform. In that case, it seems clear, Jones will bear precisely...|$|R

5|$|Rossio and Elliot {{discovered}} the novel On Stranger Tides during production of Dead Man's Chest and At World's End {{and decided to}} use it as the basis for a fourth film. As Gore Verbinski was unavailable, Bruckheimer invited Rob Marshall to direct the film. Elliott and Rossio <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a stand-alone film, with a story that would support new characters, and incorporate elements from the novel, such as Blackbeard, the Fountain of Youth and mermaids—the latter two having been already alluded to in the previous films. Depp, Rush, Greg Ellis and Kevin McNally returned to their roles, and the cast saw the additions of Ian McShane as Blackbeard and Penélope Cruz as Angelica, Blackbeard's daughter and Jack Sparrow's love interest. A further addition was Richard Griffiths as King George II of Great Britain. After the costly production of two simultaneous films, Disney tried to scale down the fourth installment, giving a lower budget, which led to cheaper locations and fewer scenes with special effects. It was also filmed in 3D, with cameras similar to the ones used in Avatar.|$|E
5|$|The Mourning Parents, {{one male}} and one female figure, are {{reclining}} {{on either side}} of the western steps on the reverse side of the monument. They represent the mourning mothers and fathers of the nation and are likely patterned on the four statues by Michelangelo on the Medici Tomb in Florence. Inscribed on the outside wall of the monument are the names of the 11,285 Canadians killed in France whose final resting place is unknown. Most Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials present names in a descending list format in a manner that permits the modification of panels as remains are found and identified. Allward instead sought to present the names as a seamless list and <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so by inscribing the names in continuous bands, across both vertical and horizontal seams, around the base of the monument. As a consequence, as remains were discovered it was not possible to remove commemorated names without interrupting the seamless list, and as a consequence there are individuals who have a known grave but are commemorated on the memorial. The memorial contains the names of four posthumous Victoria Cross recipients; Robert Grierson Combe, Frederick Hobson, William Johnstone Milne, and Robert Spall.|$|E
5|$|Zur was {{extremely}} reluctant to withdraw his personal forces. He <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so only at 09:00, {{when it became}} clear that the other two companies were at a safe distance, and the Egyptians were massing for a counterattack. First, the injured were evacuated, then the rest of the forces made their way back, each squad providing cover for the next. The Egyptian artillery caused the forces to scatter, and the commanders had difficulty diverting them to the general retreat path. After they came to a small grove to the west of the main road, it was discovered that three were missing and 17 injured, who were treated by the only remaining medic. Approximately at noon, Zur's men met with Dromi and Harpaz, and the working communication device was used to summon vehicles to take the soldiers to Gan Yavne.|$|E

5|$|Zur's {{maneuver}} sent Israel's {{forces into}} unknown territory, and they encountered an Egyptian entrenchment that caught them unawares. His original {{plan was to}} send Yosef Harpaz and the 3rd Company and then Dromi's company, but when fire was opened on Harpaz's men (at approximately 04:00), Zur ordered him to execute a frontal assault. Harpaz <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> this in three single-platoon waves: the first two would attack the Egyptians, while the third would provide cover for the forces. The first platoon was inexperienced and had never fought against Egypt's army. After advancing, they encountered what were probably Bren carriers, which their commander reported were tanks. Harpaz then sent the second, more experienced, platoon of 15 men, who were also able to better utilize the cover fire. Eventually, the first platoon fled from the battlefield without being ordered {{to do so and}} the attack was only two platoons strong. However, this still assisted Aryeh Kotzer {{on the other side of}} the Egyptian positions to evacuate his injured troops.|$|E
5|$|After the Kneitals had {{rejected}} his request for initiation into Gardnerian Wicca, Buczynski met with another Gardnerian high priestess, Patricia Siero, who instead agreed to initiate both him and Slater. Siero herself had been initiated by Fran Fisher, high priestess of a coven located in Louisville, Kentucky, in June 1973, {{who in turn}} had claimed initiation from Rosemary Buckland. The weekend after returning from Kentucky, Siero initiated Buczynski and Slater through all three degrees of the Gardnerian tradition, entitling them to operate as high priests of their own covens. Buczynski <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, founding his own Gardnerian coven with an older German woman named Renate Springer as high priestess that operated in the Brooklyn Heights area. Nevertheless, the Kneitals refused to accept Buczynski's Gardnerian credentials, asserting that Rosemary Buckland had never actually initiated Fran Fischer up to the third degree. As {{a result of the}} Kneitals' claims, the Gardnerian community in the Northeastern United States widely refused to accept the Brooklyn Heights coven as legitimate, and Siero decided to take up the Kneitals' offer for re-initiation; as a result, she disowned the initiations of Buczynski and Slater which she had carried out. Springer was uneasy at the situation, and decided to depose Buczynski from his position as high priest, replacing him with one of her initiates, Gilbert Littlebear.|$|E
5|$|Each summer (June, July, and August in the US), the {{producers}} would outline the storylines for the subsequent season. Before an episode went into production, Kauffman and Crane would revise the script written by another writer, mainly if something concerning either the series or a character felt foreign. Unlike other storylines, {{the idea for}} a relationship between Joey and Rachel was decided on halfway through the eighth season. The creators did not want Ross and Rachel to get back together so soon, and while looking for a romantic impediment, a writer suggested Joey's romantic interest in Rachel. The storyline was incorporated into the season; however, when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikable, the storyline was wrapped up, until it again resurfaced in the season's finale. For the ninth season, the writers were unsure about the amount of storyline to give to Rachel's baby, as they wanted the show neither to revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none. Crane said that it took them a while to accept the idea of a tenth season, which they <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> because they had enough stories left to tell to justify the season. Kauffman and Crane would not have signed on for an eleventh season, even if all the cast members had wanted to continue.|$|E
