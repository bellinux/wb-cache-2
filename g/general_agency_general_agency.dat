40|$|OBJECTIVES. This study {{responds}} to clinical and research interest in identifying alcohol- and drug-related problems {{in health and}} social service agency populations. These problems {{are associated with a}} variety of illnesses and social problems, and community agencies serve important screening functions. METHODS. Indicators of problematic alcohol and drug use are compared across representative samples of clients within a county's alcohol, mental health, and drug treatment systems; hospital emergency rooms; primary health clinics; criminal justice and welfare systems; and <b>general</b> population. RESULTS. <b>Agencies</b> followed a consistent rank ordering in the prevalence of substance abuse indicators. Highest prevalences were found in the populations of behavioral health agencies, including alcohol, drug, and mental health treatment facilities and criminal justice, followed by welfare <b>agencies.</b> <b>General</b> medical <b>agencies</b> served populations with the lowest prevalence and problem severity. CONCLUSION. Health and social service agencies provide significant opportunities for the screening and referral of individuals with problematic alcohol and drug use. Although behavioral agencies have higher potential for referral and intervention, general medical services may be more effective in conducting prevention and early case-finding activities...|$|R
