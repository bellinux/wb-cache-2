40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether <b>green</b> <b>public</b> <b>procurements</b> {{are potential}} drivers {{for the development}} of a landscape architecture professional field in urban design. It proposes an analysis based on the nature of professional skill sets requested and selected by the public tendering process in France. To conduct this research, an analysis of 196 public ‘calls for tender’ and their results are undertaken. Depending on the consideration of ecological concerns, two types of projects are identified: traditional projects and green projects. We examine the impact that ecological issues assert on the position of landscape architecture within the requested skills and within the winning design team. Our main results show that the emergence of <b>green</b> <b>public</b> <b>procurements</b> in France has a significant impact on the demand for new types of professional ‘competencies’ and disciplinary collaborations but not on the results after the selection process. It appears that clients request more multidisciplinarity collaborations to address green criteria. In addition, the landscape architect is always associated with multidisciplinary teams in the requirements of the public call for tender. However, the emergence of new professional skills in the environmental field challenges the expertise of landscape architects and constitutes a competitive field. Counter to the ‘call for tender’ requirements, the selection process favours monodisciplinary teams, often the architect, who is also the favourite for the lead-consultant role. Finally, we discuss how the recognition of landscape architecture as an academic discipline can influence landscape education and how a strong professional body can protect a professional title...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} years, the {{attention}} to environmental issue is growing, demonstrating the interest to protect the nature and to better use the non-renewable resources. At international level, {{and especially in the}} European Community, for different trades, a wide production of voluntary documents and institutional acts proves the interest and the need for a green economy. An innovative approach may lead to the experience of <b>Green</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Procurements</b> (GPP), to protect the environment as a public interest and to promote technological developments. So far, the experiences of GPP are limited, not entirely positive and in the field of road infrastructures almost entirely absent. Construction and maintenance of road infrastructures is objectively more complex than purchasing goods or services. The paper proposes the integration of the weighted sum multi-criteria analysis into existing procedures. The methodology needs for environmental labels related to materials, machines and works which contribute to the final product "road". The labels are recognized at international level and consistent with procedures, conditions and criteria currently published in road tenders, therefore the approach can be followed to pursue the environmental sustainability of road infrastructures without compromising the economic attention...|$|R

50|$|<b>Green</b> <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> (GPP) {{occurs when}} governments obtain goods, works, and {{services}} that are sustainable and environmentally friendly.

Rules can be a driver for green innovation and can produce financial savings. GPP can create economic growth and increase the sales of eco-industries. An example of GPP is A Plan for Public Procurement in the United Kingdom. It encourages sustainable food procurement for the public sector and its suppliers, and it sets out a vision for specific targets and outcomes.

Due to population growth and growing number of megacities, <b>Green</b> <b>Public</b> <b>Procurements</b> concepts is also becoming an increasing trend in the road infrastructure sector. This study assessed {{the environmental impacts of}} road markings considering the whole life cycle from manufacturing to disposal. For the correctness of the study, an external expert panel reviewed the assessment. By using the LCA-Methodology based on DIN ISO 14040 and 14044, an objective comparison of the following line markings was performed: Solvent-borne paint; Water-based paint; Thermoplastic and Thermo Spray Plastic; Cold Plastic and Cold Spray Plastic. Typical material formulations in characteristic application scenarios have been modelled using the data of corresponding official approval test certificates held by a major local manufacturer of all evaluated technologies. Empirical data was used to determine a typical service life of the various road marking systems at a typical average daily traffic of 10, 000 – 15, 000 vehicles per day. The life cycle assessment results, i. e. considering the whole life cycle from manufacturing to disposal, showed that a global warming potential reduction of more than 50 % can be achieved by a more durable road marking system. The study concluded that in order to access the actual environmental impact of road markings, a lifetime evaluation including, for instance, production, application, transport, service life, and disposal must be taken into consideration...|$|R

40|$|<b>Green</b> <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> is {{a public}} procurement, which {{integrates}} environmental considerations into the public procurement process, and it {{is considered to be}} an appropriate tool seeking to reduce negative impacts on the environment. Therefore this paper aims to analyze results of <b>green</b> <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> implementation in Lithuania over the 2008 – 2010 year period, considering its scope and possibilities for reducing environmental impacts. It is determined that practical implementation of <b>green</b> <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> in Lithuania is not smooth and is far from achieving the objectives yet. In 2008 green procurement amounted to 8. 3 %, in 2009 – 6. 1 %, in 2010 – 5. 8 % {{of the total number of}} public procurements performed. The biggest share of performed <b>green</b> <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> is applied for works (82 %), mainly related to the construction. However, some possibilities to reduce environmental impacts in terms of CO 2 have been missed. To compare to the benefit achieved, estimations show that in the case of personal computers, printers and vehicles, 126 - 150 tons of CO 2 could have been saved additionally per year, if environmental criteria had been applied to 50 % of particular performed procurements. Hence, it is especially important to speed up the development of <b>green</b> <b>public</b> <b>procurement</b> in Lithuania, ensuring not only lowering negative impact on the environment, but also developing the market for environment-friendly goods and services. <br /...|$|E
