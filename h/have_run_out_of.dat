5|$|The {{writers of}} The Simpsons {{went on strike}} {{together}} with the Writers Guild of America {{at the end of}} 2007. The broadcasting of The Simpsons was not affected by the strike. Since {{it takes a long time}} to produce an episode of an animated show, the episodes are written up to a year in advance. So the strike would have had to go on for a while for the show to <b>have</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> new episodes. Production of season 20 was further delayed because of contract negotiations with the six main voice actors. The dispute was resolved, and the actors' salary was raised to $400,000 per episode. The delay in production has caused the planned 22 episodes to be shortened to 20.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, {{which took place}} in cooler weather conditions, Sarrazin in the No. 6 Toyota, was fastest with a time of one minute and 58.566 seconds, which was set early in the 90-minute period. His team-mate Nakajima finished with the second-quickest time, with Mark Webber in the No. 1 Porsche ending up third-fastest. The second Audi vehicle did not take part because their mechanics were unable to repair a failed front axle drivetrain. Roberto Merhi achieved the only time under the two minute and eight second mark in LMP2 in the No. 45 Manor Oreca with a lap of two minutes and 7.865 seconds, eight-tenths of a second faster than the second G-Drive car of van der Garde. LMGTE Pro was led by James Calado in the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari with the Italian marque setting the fastest time in the LMGTE Am with its No. 83 vehicle being driven by Rui Águas. The session was ended prematurely with seven minutes remaining when Yutaka Yamagishi was reported to <b>have</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> fuel in Larbre Compétition's No. 50 Chevrolet and then collided with the barriers at Stavelot corner.|$|E

YPG fighters also attacked suspected ISIL militants between the villages of Geydade and Sina, to the northwest of Sarrin, killing five ISIL militants. On the night of 26 July, YPG-led forces captured the security center at the center of Sarrin, while ISIL militants were said to <b>have</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ammunition.

25|$|On 7 May Rhys-Davids {{took part}} in a {{disastrous}} sortie. The day was cloudy with thick layers of cumulus between 2,000 and 10,000 feet. Rhys-Davids's flight kept just below the cloud to avoid attack, and headed towards Cambrai. Eleven Royal Aircraft Factory SE5s of 56 Squadron ran into the experienced German airmen of Jasta 11 of the Flying Circus. One of the Squadron 56 flight commanders, famous ace Albert Ball (44 victories), was killed when he likely flew into the ground after becoming disorientated in low-lying cloud. Three other British pilots were shot down, including Rhys-Davids. He came under attack from an Albatros D.V which was painted red, with a green band behind the cockpit. The pilot was Kurt Wolff, a very experienced pilot and ace with 20 victories. Rhys-Davids was unaware he was under attack until he saw Wolff's tracers pass his aircraft. He evaded Wolff's initial attack and a duel for position followed. Rhys-Davids's guns jammed but he managed to get up to Wolff's height and took evasive action. But he had taken hits to the wing, undercarriage and engine. He kept cool and continued turning, denying the German an easy shot. As Rhys-Davids was deciding just how best to escape his hazardous position, Wolff abandoned the fight and headed for Douai. Rhys-Davids headed for British lines, his engine streaming water; west of Arras his engine finally seized up. He attempted to glide to Belle Vue but had insufficient height and force-landed near La Herliere. The reason for Wolff's decision to break off combat is unknown. He may <b>have</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ammunition or perhaps was low on fuel.|$|E

500|$|Ecstasys {{recording}} {{was plagued}} by technical and financial errors, which impacted the eventual release of the album. The mastering process was affected by the album's engineer Steve Nunn, who mislaid the source material of the final mix prior to its transfer to the master recording. Shields subsequently [...] "brought an independent engineer in to the studios to point out what was wrong" [...] but Lazy Records refused to invest further finances into the album's recording process. As a result, [...] "much of what was originally the sound of Ecstacy [...] was lost, {{and much of the}} tone was dulled" [...] and the album [...] "showed a group who appeared to <b>have</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> money half way through recording".|$|E
500|$|Under {{pressure}} from Lazy Records {{to release a}} full-length album, My Bloody Valentine compromised and agreed to release a single and subsequent mini album, citing the need for time to stabilize their new line-up. [...] "Strawberry Wine", a three-track single, was released in November 1987 and Ecstasy was released a month later. Both received moderate critical acclaim, and peaked at number 13 and 12 on the independent singles and albums chart, respectively. [...] "Strawberry Wine", however, was described as [...] "certainly the better of the two releases", as Ecstasy was plagued by production difficulties, including errors in the mastering process. Ecstasy was criticised as showing [...] "a group who appeared to <b>have</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> money halfway through recording", which was later confirmed, as the band were funding the studio sessions themselves. My Bloody Valentine's contract with Lazy stated that the label would handle promotion of releases, whereas the band would finance the recording sessions. Following their departure from Lazy, who later rereleased [...] "Strawberry Wine" [...] and Ecstasy on the compilation album Ecstasy and Wine (1989) without the band's consent, Rough Trade Records offered a deal to finance the recording and release of a full-length album, but the band turned it down.|$|E

[...] The A.V. Clubs Nathan Rabin gave it a C rating, calling it [...] a disappointing episode. In regards to Jason Sudeikis, Rabin commented that he is a [...] "gifted comic actor" [...] but this episode [...] "found him at his hammy, embarrassing worst." [...] Meredith Blake, writing for the Los Angeles Times, remarked that the episode [...] "may have been the worst one yet", and said that when Floyd [...] called Liz a [...] "badger", her heart broke into smithereens, [...] "There's mean-funny, and then there's plain old mean. [...] Liz's love life has become the central butt of the joke on 30 Rock... and it's starting to feel like the writers <b>have</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> ways to be funny without being sadistic." [...] Sean Gandert of Paste said that [...] "Floyd" [...] was not a great episode, [...] "but it's still pretty good by this season's standards, if a somewhat disappointing use of Floyd's return." [...] He explained that part of the episode's problem was that Liz's relationships not succeeding [...] "has become pretty old hat for the show since we've seen it time and time again", and hoped to see her [...] "find a good man and let the show move onto something else for a while." [...] TV Guides Adam Mersel wrote that it [...] "really didn't do it for me. I didn't really laugh out loud much, and the cameo from one of my favorite SNL players came off a bit forced." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{science fiction}} (sf) had been {{published}} before the 1920s, it did not begin to coalesce into a separately marketed genre until the appearance in 1926 of Amazing Stories, a pulp magazine published by Hugo Gernsback. [...] After 1931, when Miracle Science and Fantasy Stories was launched, no new science fiction magazines appeared for several years. [...] In 1934 a science fiction comic strip following the adventures of superhero Flash Gordon appeared in newspapers and quickly became popular. [...] In 1936 the strip spawned a movie serial in thirteen parts, also titled Flash Gordon. Late that year Harold Hersey, an experienced pulp magazine editor and publisher, decided to launch three new magazines based on comics. [...] The first two were titled Dan Dunn Detective Magazine and Tailspin Tommy Air Adventure Magazine; these were launched in September and October 1936 respectively. [...] The third was Flash Gordon Strange Adventures Magazine, which saw a single issue, dated December 1936; it was copyrighted by both Hersey and King Features, the syndicate that owned the copyright to Flash Gordon. [...] Dan Dunn and Tailspin Tommy produced one more issue each before Hersey closed down the venture. [...] It is not known why only one issue of Flash Gordon Strange Adventure Magazine appeared; poor sales figures from the other magazines may have been responsible, or Hersey may simply <b>have</b> <b>run</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> money, or possibly King Features, {{the owner of the}} copyright to Flash Gordon, only granted rights to Hersey for one issue, and withdrew from the venture after the first issue appeared. [...] Sf historian Everett Bleiler notes that Hersey did not mention the venture in his autobiographical Pulpwood Editor, published a year later, and adds that [...] "given Hersey's usual attempts to glorify himself and to gild his failures, this silence suggests a fiasco larger than usual".|$|E
