Remarkably, the {{dispersion}} relation in one-dimensional Kitaev systems allows for wavepackets of arbitrary size undergoing non-decaying ZB without any distortion, with the typical ZB amplitude being one lattice site. To motivate possible experimental interest in this dynamical aspect of superconducting systems, we further show that certain on-resonance modulation of the Hamiltonian parameter can be exploited to convert ZB oscillations to net <b>drifting</b> <b>of</b> <b>particle's</b> wavepacket and hole's wavepacket along opposite directions, leading to long-distance particle-hole separation.

40|$|Many {{substorm}} expansions are {{triggered by}} interplanetary magnetic field changes that reduce magnetospheric convection. This suggests that expansion onsets {{are a result}} of a reduction in the large-scale electric field imparted to the magnetosphere from the solar wind. Such a reduction disrupts the inward motion and energization of plasma sheet particles that occur during the growth phase. It is proposed that the resulting magnetic <b>drift</b> <b>of</b> <b>particles</b> and a large dawn to dusk gradient in the ion energies leads to a longitudinally localized reduction in the plasma pressure, and thus, to the current wedge formation. This theory accounts for the rapid development of the expansion phase relative to growth phase, the magnitude of the wedge currents, the speeds of tailward and westward expansion of the current reduction region in the equatorial plane, and the speeds of the poleward and westward motion of active aurora in the ionosphere...|$|E

This mechanism gives rise to the formation of hard power-law spectra in parameter regimes where the energy density in the reconnecting field exceeds the rest mass energy density σ≡ B^ 2 /(4 π n m_ec^ 2) > 1 and when the system size is sufficiently large. In the limit σ≫ 1, the spectral index approaches p= 1 and most of the available energy is converted into non-thermal particles. A simple analytic model is proposed which explains these key features and predicts a general condition under which hard power-law spectra will be generated from magnetic reconnection.

The periodical tidal current combined with a background current is found to introduce a transport between Vestfjorden inside Lofotodden and the shelf outside. This particular transport may be important for the drift of cod eggs, larvae and other important biological and chemical tracers. A fine-resolution numerical model provided the Eulerian tidal current field based on which the particle trajectories are calculated using a Lagrangian particle tracking technique. The tracking algorithm was extended by a random-walk method to simulate small scale turbulence.

The resulting phoretic effect can be quantified by a single dimensionless number. Phenomenological considerations lead to simple predictions for the mean separation between particles, which are consistent with results of direct numerical simulations.
