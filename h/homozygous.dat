5|$|An {{expert panel}} in 2006 advised on early {{combination}} therapy with LDL apheresis, statins, and cholesterol absorption inhibitors {{in children with}} <b>homozygous</b> FH at the highest risk.|$|E
5|$|Loss {{of hybrid}} vigour occurs and {{phenotype}} varies greatly in subsequent generations if F1 hybrids are inter-bred or backcrossed with animals genetically {{similar to the}} F1 parent. Inter-bred F1 hybrids will produce progeny that can be either heterozygous for each gene variant, <b>homozygous</b> for one gene variant, or <b>homozygous</b> for the other gene variant. When one of the variants has a large effect on a trait, for example the effect of myostatin variants on muscularity, larger phenotypic variation will occur among the progeny. Backcross progeny will have less phenotypic variation and comprise animals that are either heterozygous for each gene variant or <b>homozygous</b> for the variant found in the original F1 backcross parent.|$|E
5|$|Pulos and Hutt {{knew that}} if the allele that created a white coat was recessive, then white horses {{would have to be}} <b>homozygous</b> for the {{condition}} and therefore breeding white horses together would always result in a white foal. However, this did not occur in their study and they concluded that white was not recessive. Conversely, if a white coat was a simple autosomal dominant, ww horses would be non-white, while both Ww and WW horses would be white, and the latter would always produce white offspring. But Pulos and Hutt did not observe any white horses that always produced white offspring, suggesting that <b>homozygous</b> dominant (WW) white horses did not exist. As a result, Pulos and Hutt concluded that white was semidominant and lethal in the <b>homozygous</b> state: ww horses were non-white, Ww were white, and WW died.|$|E
5|$|The global {{prevalence}} of FH is approximately 10 million people. In most populations studied, heterozygous FH occurs in about 1:500 people, {{but not all}} develop symptoms. <b>Homozygous</b> FH occurs in about 1:1,000,000.|$|E
5|$|A Limousin/Jersey {{backcross}} {{study conducted}} in Australia and New Zealand {{to investigate the}} effects of the F94L myostatin variant concluded that the mutation had no significant effect on birth-weight and growth traits. Averaged over all backcross calves in the trial (total of 766), animals <b>homozygous</b> for the mutation had approximately 6% heavier carcases than animals without the mutation, 15% larger eye muscle (also known as rib eye) area, 13% heavier silverside weight, and 13% heavier total meat weight. Increased meat weight and size was accompanied by a 15% reduction in intra-muscular fat and 25% reduction in total fat weight. No other significant effects were observed. A second backcross study conducted in Japan of Limousin and Japanese Black breeds identified similar changes to meat and fat quantities in cattle <b>homozygous</b> for the F94L mutation.|$|E
5|$|About 1 in 300 to 500 {{people have}} {{mutations}} in the LDLR gene that encodes the LDL receptor protein, which normally removes LDL from the circulation, or apolipoprotein B (ApoB), {{which is the}} part of LDL that binds with the receptor; mutations in other genes are rare. People who have one abnormal copy (are heterozygous) of the LDLR gene may develop cardiovascular disease prematurely at the age of 30 to 40. Having two abnormal copies (being <b>homozygous)</b> may cause severe cardiovascular disease in childhood. Heterozygous FH is a common genetic disorder, inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, occurring in 1:500 people in most countries; <b>homozygous</b> FH is much rarer, occurring in 1 in a million births.|$|E
5|$|According to a 2011 study, 13 out of 245 Labradors studied were {{heterozygous}} for the M264V mutation {{responsible for}} the melanistic mask, and one was <b>homozygous.</b> Within the breed, this trait is not visible.|$|E
5|$|Although no {{distinguishing}} structural features {{have been}} found to separate the workers and queens, the male is easily identified by its bulging eyes, subquadrate clypeus, and slender antennae. P. exclamans males are also more variable in external morphology compared to females. This is possible given the maleâ€™s hemizygosity (females are <b>homozygous).</b>|$|E
5|$|British {{test results}} of sale bulls in February 2010 {{indicated}} that of 142 animals tested, just under 90% were <b>homozygous</b> for the F94L mutation, about 8.5% were heterozygous, and 1.5% {{did not have}} the mutation.|$|E
5|$|Heterozygous FH is {{normally}} treated with statins, bile acid sequestrants, or other lipid lowering agents that lower cholesterol levels. New cases are generally offered genetic counseling. <b>Homozygous</b> FH often {{does not respond}} to medical therapy and may require other treatments, including LDL apheresis (removal of LDL in a method similar to dialysis) and occasionally liver transplantation.|$|E
5|$|Of the 14 Limousins tested {{during the}} {{research}} {{that led to the}} discovery of the F94L variant, 12 cattle were <b>homozygous</b> for the variant and two were heterozygous. The second myostatin gene in both heterozygous cases were each different myostatin MH variants of types normally found in Belgian Blue and Charolais cattle.|$|E
5|$|Test {{results of}} 1028 cattle {{recorded}} in the Australian and New Zealand herd book indicate that 96.7% of Fullbloods (known in Australia as French Pure), 88.0% of purebreds, and 33.3% of a limited sample of Lim-Flex were <b>homozygous</b> for the F94L mutation.|$|E
5|$|Test {{results of}} {{approximately}} 1,100 cattle {{recorded in the}} North American Limousin Foundation herd book show the following distributions for three classes of animal. About 94.4% of Fullbloods, 62.3% of purebreds and 5.3% of Lim-Flex were <b>homozygous</b> for the F94L mutation.|$|E
5|$|The {{two major}} Limousin hybrids are Brahmousin (a cross between Brahman and Limousin cattle)) and Lim-Flex (a cross between Angus and Limousin cattle), which were both {{developed}} before {{the significance of}} the F94L myostatin variant had been quantified. When Limousins <b>homozygous</b> for the F94L myostatin mutation are used in crossbreeding, only one of the mutations will be inherited (that is, progeny will be heterozygous for the mutation), and a high level of phenotypic uniformity and hybrid vigour would be expected in the progeny. However, breeding using heterozygous animals as parents, which could include purebred Limousins of low percentage Full French content, and Lim-Flex and Brahmousin hybrids that have not been bred to a uniform (<b>homozygous)</b> standard over several generations, would produce progeny with inconsistent carcase characteristics and production value depending upon whether or not the F94L mutation was inherited.|$|E
5|$|Transgenic mice with <b>homozygous</b> {{depletion}} of NEDD9 are vital and fertile, but have immunological abnormalities {{that result in}} pre-malignant conditions later in life, defects are initially subtle, but increase in later life; B cell homing to the spleen and lymphocyte trafficking are deficient.|$|E
5|$|Although {{atherosclerosis}} {{occurs to}} a certain degree in all people, people with FH may develop accelerated atherosclerosis due to the excess level of LDL. The degree of atherosclerosis approximately depends on the number of LDL receptors still expressed and the functionality of these receptors. In many heterozygous forms of FH, the receptor function is only mildly impaired, and LDL levels will remain relatively low. In the more serious <b>homozygous</b> forms, the receptor is not expressed at all.|$|E
5|$|Although the Australian/New Zealand {{study found}} that the F94L {{mutation}} was partially to significantly recessive in most traits, meaning cattle heterozygous for the mutation express less to significantly {{less than half of the}} effects noted for <b>homozygous</b> cattle, the Japanese {{study found that}} the meat and fat quantities in cattle heterozygous for the mutation were about midway between the two extremes.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Pulos and Hutt's work, {{researchers}} were {{split on the}} mode of inheritance of white and whether it was deleterious (harmful). Recent research has discovered several possible genetic pathways to a white coat, so disparities in these historical findings may reflect the action of different genes. It {{is also possible that}} the varied origins of Pulos and Hutt's white horses might be responsible for the lack of homozygotes. Therefore, it remains to be proven whether all equine dominant white mutations cause embryonic lethality in the <b>homozygous</b> state.|$|E
5|$|Single cross hybrids {{result from}} the cross between two true-breeding organisms which {{produces}} an F1 hybrid (first filial generation). The cross between two different <b>homozygous</b> lines produces an F1 hybrid that is heterozygous; having two alleles, one contributed by each parent and typically one is dominant and the other recessive. Typically, the F1 generation is also phenotypically homogeneous, producing offspring that are all similar to each other.|$|E
5|$|The Tiger Species Survival Plan has {{condemned}} the breeding of white tigers, alleging {{they are of}} mixed ancestry and of unknown lineage. The genes responsible for white colouration are represented by 0.001% of the population. The disproportionate growth in numbers of white tigers points to inbreeding among <b>homozygous</b> recessive individuals. This would lead to inbreeding depression and loss of genetic variability.|$|E
5|$|The Wilson's disease gene (ATP7B) {{has been}} mapped to {{chromosome}} 13 (13q14.3) and is expressed {{primarily in the}} liver, kidney, and placenta. The gene codes for a P-type (cation transport enzyme) ATPase that transports copper into bile and incorporates it into ceruloplasmin. Mutations can be detected in 90% of cases. Most (60%) are <b>homozygous</b> for ATP7B mutations (two abnormal copies), and 30% have only one abnormal copy. Ten percent have no detectable mutation.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} sickle cell trait on malaria {{immunity}} illustrates some evolutionary trade-offs {{that have occurred}} because of endemic malaria. Sickle cell trait causes {{a change in the}} hemoglobin molecule in the blood. Normally, red blood cells have a very flexible, biconcave shape that allows them to move through narrow capillaries; however, when the modified hemoglobinS molecules are exposed to low amounts of oxygen, or crowd together due to dehydration, they can stick together forming strands that cause the cell to sickle or distort into a curved shape. In these strands the molecule is not as effective in taking or releasing oxygen, and the cell is not flexible enough to circulate freely. In the early stages of malaria, the parasite can cause infected red cells to sickle, and so they are removed from circulation sooner. This reduces the frequency with which malaria parasites complete their life cycle in the cell. Individuals who are <b>homozygous</b> (with two copies of the abnormal hemoglobin beta allele) have sickle-cell anaemia, while those who are heterozygous (with one abnormal allele and one normal allele) experience resistance to malaria without severe anemia. Although the shorter life expectancy for those with the <b>homozygous</b> condition would tend to disfavor the trait's survival, the trait is preserved in malaria-prone regions because of the benefits provided by the heterozygous form.|$|E
5|$|The risk of VTE is {{increased}} in pregnancy by {{about five times}} because of a more hypercoagulable state, a likely adaptation against fatal postpartum hemorrhage. Additionally, pregnant women with genetic risk factors are subject to a roughly three to 30 times increased risk for VTE. Preventative treatments for pregnancy-related VTE in hypercoagulable women were suggested by the ACCP. <b>Homozygous</b> carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with {{a family history of}} VTE were suggested for antepartum LMWH and either LMWH or a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for the six weeks following childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia and a family history but no previous VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH orâ€”for those without protein C or S deficiencyâ€”a VKA. <b>Homozygous</b> carriers of factor V Leiden or prothrombin G20210A with no personal or family history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting during pregnancy and LMWH or a VKA for six weeks after childbirth. Those with another thrombophilia but no family or personal history of VTE were suggested for watchful waiting only. Warfarin, a common VKA, can cause harm to the fetus and is not used for VTE prevention during pregnancy.|$|E
5|$|Two coat color genes {{found in}} Morgans {{have also been}} linked to genetic disorders. One is the genetic ocular {{syndrome}} multiple congenital ocular anomalies (MCOA), originally called equine anterior segment dysgenesis (ASD). MCOA {{is characterized by the}} abnormal development of some ocular tissues, which causes compromised vision, although generally of a mild form; the disease is non-progressive. Genetic studies have shown that it is closely tied to the silver dapple gene. A small number of Morgans carry the silver dapple allele, which causes cysts but no apparent vision problems if heterozygous, but when <b>homozygous</b> can cause vision problems. There is also the possibility of lethal white syndrome, a fatal disease seen in foals who are <b>homozygous</b> for the frame overo gene. At present, there is one mare line in the Morgan breed that has produced healthy heterozygous frame overo individuals. The American Morgan Horse Association advocates genetic testing to identify carriers of these genetics, and advises owners to avoid breeding horses that are heterozygous for frame overo to each other.|$|E
5|$|When {{one parent}} is {{heterozygous}} for the mutation, {{and the other}} <b>homozygous</b> for the mutation or the normal form of the myostatin gene, the expected average difference in rib eye area of progeny will be about 0.9in2 (12.3in2 x 7.5%), {{depending on whether the}} mutation or normal form of the gene is inherited from the heterozygous parent. In this case, the unpredictable variation in rib eye area represents about twice the possible change value for a 0% BIF accuracy.|$|E
5|$|A rare but serious {{complication}} {{resulting from}} treatment with warfarin is warfarin necrosis, which occurs more frequently shortly after commencing treatment {{in patients with}} a deficiency of protein C. Protein C is an innate anticoagulant that, like the procoagulant factors that warfarin inhibits, requires vitamin K-dependent carboxylation for its activity. Since warfarin initially decreases protein C levels faster than the coagulation factors, it can paradoxically increase the blood's tendency to coagulate when treatment is first begun (many patients when starting on warfarin are given heparin in parallel to combat this), leading to massive thrombosis with skin necrosis and gangrene of limbs. Its natural counterpart, purpura fulminans, occurs in children who are <b>homozygous</b> for certain protein C mutations.|$|E
5|$|Cholesterol {{levels may}} be {{determined}} {{as part of}} health screening for health insurance or occupational health, when the external physical signs such as xanthelasma, xanthoma, arcus are noticed, symptoms of cardiovascular disease develop, or a family member {{has been found to}} have FH. A pattern compatible with hyperlipoproteinemia type IIa on the Fredrickson classification is typically found: raised level of total cholesterol, markedly raised level of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), normal level of high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and normal level of triglycerides. Total cholesterol levels of 350â€“550 mg/dL are typical of heterozygous FH while total cholesterol levels of 650â€“1000 mg/dL are typical of <b>homozygous</b> FH. The LDL is typically above the 75th percentile, that is, 75% of the healthy population would have a lower LDL level. Cholesterol levels can be drastically higher in people with FH who are also obese.|$|E
5|$|Lavender Foal Syndrome (LFS), {{also called}} Coat Color Dilution Lethal (CCDL). Recessive disorder, fatal when <b>homozygous,</b> {{carriers}} show no signs. The condition has its name because most affected foals {{are born with}} a coat color dilution that lightens {{the tips of the}} coat hairs, or even the entire hair shaft. Foals with LFS are unable to stand at birth, often have seizures, and are usually euthanized within a few days of birth. In November 2009, Cornell University announced that a DNA test has been developed to detect carriers of LFS. Simultaneously, the University of Pretoria also announced that they had also developed a DNA test.|$|E
5|$|This {{family of}} white horses {{produced}} Old King in 1908, a dark-eyed white stallion that {{was purchased by}} Caleb R. and Hudson B. Thompson. Old King was bred to Morgan mares to produce a breed of horse known today as the American White Horse. A grandson of Old King, Snow King, {{was at the center}} of the first major study of the dominant white coat color in horses, conducted in 1969 by Dr. William L. Pulos of Alfred University and Dr. Frederick B. Hutt of Cornell. They concluded, based on test matings and progeny phenotype ratios, that the white coat was dominantly inherited and embryonic lethal in the <b>homozygous</b> state. Other factors, such as variations in expressivity and the influence of multiple genes, may have influenced the progeny ratios that Pulos and Hutt observed. The white coat of the American White Horse has not yet been mapped.|$|E
5|$|W3 {{is found}} in Arabian horses descended from R Khasper, a near-white {{stallion}} born in 1996. Neither of his parents were white, and the causative mutation (c.706A>T) {{is thought to have}} originated with this horse. It is a nonsense mutation on Exon4. Horses with the W3 allele often retain interspersed flecks or regions of pigmented skin and hair, which may fade with time. Some members of this family possess blue eyes, but these are thought to be inherited separately from the white coat. Based on similar studies in mice, researchers have named W3 as potentially <b>homozygous</b> nonviable.|$|E
5|$|<b>Homozygous</b> FH {{is harder}} to treat. The LDL receptors are {{minimally}} functional, if at all. Only high doses of statins, often {{in combination with other}} medications, are modestly effective in improving lipid levels. If medical therapy is not successful at reducing cholesterol levels, LDL apheresis may be used; this filters LDL from the bloodstream in a process reminiscent of dialysis. Very severe cases may be considered for a liver transplant; this provides a liver with normally functional LDL receptors, and leads to rapid improvement of the cholesterol levels, but at the risk of complications from any solid organ transplant (such as rejection, infections, or side-effects of the medication required to suppress rejection). Other surgical techniques include partial ileal bypass surgery, in which part of the small bowel is bypassed to decrease the absorption of nutrients and hence cholesterol, and portacaval shunt surgery, in which the portal vein is connected to the vena cava to allow blood with nutrients from the intestine to bypass the liver.|$|E
5|$|Progeny of {{two parents}} of {{different}} breeds are termed F1 hybrids, F1 crosses or first crosses. F1 hybrids generally have an extremely uniform phenotype {{and benefit from}} hybrid vigour. These advantages are observed in the breeding {{of a wide variety}} of animals and plants, and arise because progeny inherit one of each paired gene from each parent. When both parents are <b>homozygous</b> for different variants of genes (known as alleles), which is likely to be the case when a breed has been developed and selected over several generations, progeny will inherit both gene variants present in the parents. The F1 hybrid progeny will then be heterozygous for each gene variant, which in turn increases the likelihood that the genes will code for an optimal protein or enzyme. This is the genetic basis of hybrid vigour. While many gene variants have effects that are of little consequence to beef production, a few, such as the myostatin variants found in different cattle breeds, have a major effect.|$|E
5|$|Some {{forms of}} {{balancing}} selection do {{not result in}} fixation, but maintain an allele at intermediate frequencies in a population. This can occur in diploid species (with pairs of chromosomes) when heterozygous individuals (with just one copy of the allele) have a higher fitness than <b>homozygous</b> individuals (with two copies). This is called heterozygote advantage or over-dominance, of which the best-known example is the resistance to malaria in humans heterozygous for sickle-cell anaemia. Maintenance of allelic variation can also occur through disruptive or diversifying selection, which favours genotypes that depart from the average in either direction (that is, the opposite of over-dominance), and {{can result in a}} bimodal distribution of trait values. Finally, balancing selection can occur through frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of one particular phenotype depends on the distribution of other phenotypes in the population. The principles of game theory have been applied to understand the fitness distributions in these situations, particularly in the study of kin selection and the evolution of reciprocal altruism.|$|E
25|$|Mating a <b>homozygous</b> fold {{with any}} cat will produce all folds, but because <b>homozygous</b> folds {{are prone to}} severe health issues, {{breeding}} for them is generally considered unethical. A <b>homozygous</b> to normal mating will produce only heterozygous folds but presumably in ethical breeding programs, {{there will be no}} <b>homozygous</b> cats available to breed from.|$|E
25|$|In some breeds, <b>homozygous</b> roans can be {{identified}} by an indirect DNA marker test. Such horses, with the genotype Rn/Rn, produce 100% roan offspring. <b>Homozygous</b> roans and heterozygous roans (Rn/rn) are identical in appearance.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of the cream gene {{had a significant effect}} on breeding, allowing <b>homozygous</b> blue-eyed creams to be recognized by many breed registries that had previously registered palominos but banned cremellos, under the mistaken notion that <b>homozygous</b> cream was a form of Albinism.|$|E
