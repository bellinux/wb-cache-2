5|$|Biological {{control is}} a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects, mites, weeds and plant diseases using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory, or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role.

5|$|June through November is {{hurricane}} {{season in the}} Atlantic Basin and Caribbean Sea, with the most tropical activity occurring between mid-August to mid-October. Rain dropped by tropical systems is an <b>important</b> <b>component</b> of the area's annual precipitation and is vital for replenishing the water supply of communities around Tampa Bay.|$|E
5|$|Portraiture was an <b>important</b> <b>component</b> of Rodin's oeuvre, {{helping him}} to win {{acceptance}} and financial independence. His first sculpture was a bust of his father in 1860, and he produced at least 56 portraits between 1877 and his death in 1917. Early subjects included fellow sculptor Jules Dalou (1883) and companion Camille Claudel (1884).|$|E

5|$|Zinc {{selenide}} was {{the first}} material for blue LEDs, but gallium nitride is dominating the market now. Cadmium selenide was an <b>important</b> <b>component</b> in quantum dots. Sheets of amorphous selenium convert X-ray images to patterns of charge in xeroradiography and in solid-state, flat-panel X-ray cameras. Ionized selenium (Se+24) {{is one of the}} active mediums used in X-ray lasers.|$|E
5|$|Alpine areas, such {{as those}} of Kosciuszko National Park, are at {{particular}} risk; low-growing alpine flora is highly vulnerable to trampling, and the short summers mean little time for plants to grow and recover from damage. The biodiversity there is high, with 853 species of plant, 21 of which are found nowhere else. Erosion in the limestone karst areas leads to runoff and silting. Sphagnum moss is an <b>important</b> <b>component</b> of highland bogs, and is trampled by horses seeking water.|$|E
5|$|An <b>important</b> <b>component</b> to the Holocaust in Lithuania {{was that}} the occupying Nazi German {{administration}} fanned antisemitism by blaming the Soviet regime's recent annexation of Lithuania, a year earlier, on the Jewish community. Another significant factor was the large {{extent to which the}} Nazis' design drew upon the physical organization, preparation and execution of their orders by local Lithuanian auxiliaries of the Nazi occupation regime.|$|E

5|$|In C++ {{computer}} programming, allocators are an <b>important</b> <b>component</b> of the C++ Standard Library. The standard library provides several data structures, such as {{list and}} set, {{commonly referred to}} as containers. A common trait among these containers is their ability to change size during the execution of the program. To achieve this, some form of dynamic memory allocation is usually required. Allocators handle all the requests for allocation and deallocation of memory for a given container. The C++ Standard Library provides general-purpose allocators that are used by default, however, custom allocators may also be supplied by the programmer.|$|E
5|$|In music, {{noise is}} {{variously}} described as unpitched, indeterminate, uncontrolled, loud, unmusical, or unwanted sound. Noise is an <b>important</b> <b>component</b> {{of the sound}} of the human voice and all musical instruments, particularly in unpitched percussion instruments and electric guitars (using distortion). Electronic instruments create various colours of noise. Traditional uses of noise are unrestricted, using all the frequencies associated with pitch and timbre, such as the white noise component of a drum roll on a snare drum, or the transients present in the prefix of the sounds of some organ pipes.|$|E
5|$|Most natural {{membranes}} are {{a complex}} mixture of different lipid molecules. If {{some of the}} components are liquid at a given temperature while others are in the gel phase, the two phases can coexist in spatially separated regions, rather like an iceberg floating in the ocean. This phase separation plays {{a critical role in}} biochemical phenomena because membrane components such as proteins can partition into one or the other phase and thus be locally concentrated or activated. One particularly <b>important</b> <b>component</b> of many mixed phase systems is cholesterol, which modulates bilayer permeability, mechanical strength, and biochemical interactions.|$|E

5|$|The SCN {{projects}} {{to a set}} of areas in the hypothalamus, brainstem, and midbrain that are involved in implementing sleep-wake cycles. An <b>important</b> <b>component</b> of the system is the reticular formation, a group of neuron-clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain. Reticular neurons send signals to the thalamus, which in turn sends activity-level-controlling signals to every part of the cortex. Damage to the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma.|$|E
5|$|The common {{element to}} both church and palazzi {{interior}} design was the stucco work. Stucco is an <b>important</b> <b>component</b> of the Baroque design and philosophy, as it seamlessly combines architecture, sculpture, and painting in three-dimensional form. Its combination with trompe l'oeil ceilings and walls in Baroque illusionistic painting confuses reality and art. While in churches the stucco could represent angels and putti linked by swags of flowers, {{in a private}} house it might represent the owner's favourite foods or musical instruments.|$|E
5|$|The first {{structure}} of an organic compound, hexamethylenetetramine, was solved in 1923. This {{was followed by}} several studies of long-chain fatty acids, which are an <b>important</b> <b>component</b> of biological membranes. In the 1930s, the structures of much larger molecules with two-dimensional complexity began to be solved. A significant advance was the {{structure of}} phthalocyanine, a large planar molecule that {{is closely related to}} porphyrin molecules important in biology, such as heme, corrin and chlorophyll.|$|E

5|$|The {{vestibulocochlear nerve}} (VIII) splits into the {{vestibular}} and cochlear nerve. The vestibular part {{is responsible for}} innervating the vestibules and semicircular canal of the inner ear; this structure transmits information about balance, and is an <b>important</b> <b>component</b> of the vestibuloocular reflex, which keeps the head stable and allows the eyes to track moving objects. The cochlear nerve transmits information from the cochlea, allowing sound to be heard.|$|E
5|$|Valued for its meat, the finetooth shark {{forms an}} <b>important</b> <b>component</b> of the {{commercial}} gillnet shark fishery operating off the southeastern United States. Population assessments suggest that this fishery does not currently {{pose a threat to}} U.S. populations of the species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has therefore listed the finetooth shark under Least Concern, though no fishery data are available for this species off South America. This shark is not known to pose a danger to humans, though it snaps vigorously when captured and should be handled with caution.|$|E
5|$|Bevan {{suggested}} a political deception {{with the aim}} of convincing the Swedish government that the Allies intended to invade Norway. During the war Sweden maintained a neutral position, and had relations with both Axis and the Allied nations. It was therefore assumed that if Sweden believed in an imminent threat to Norway this would be passed on to German intelligence. Graffham was envisioned as an extension of existing pressure the Allies were placing on Sweden to end their neutral stance, one example being the requests to end the export of ball bearings (an <b>important</b> <b>component</b> in military hardware) to Germany. By increasing this pressure with additional, false requests, Bevan hoped to further convince the Germans that Sweden was preparing to join the Allied nations.|$|E
