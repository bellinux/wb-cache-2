Utility crews from across the country came to the state to assist in returning power, though power outages persisted for several days. Over 2,500 utility members worked, in some cases around the clock, to restore the power. One power company restored power to 68% of its affected customers by the day after Isabel passed through the area. By four days after landfall, 83,000 customers were without power, down from its peak of several hundred thousand.|$|E
5|$|Initially {{the storm}} posed {{a threat to}} Florida, where {{military}} officials kept abreast of the situation. Heavy surf advisories were posted from central portions of the state northward to Georgia, and the National Hurricane Center advised that swimming and boating should be avoided. The Mayport Naval Station ordered 25ships out to sea {{in advance of the}} approaching storm. The Salvation Army was on standby in Jacksonville, prepared to act when needed. <b>Hardware</b> <b>stores</b> in the state reported up to a 75% increase in the sales of emergency supplies.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} of Bermuda issued a hurricane {{watch for the}} island on September 8, which {{was followed by a}} tropical storm warning on September 9. These were replaced by a hurricane warning on September 10, coinciding with the storm's strengthening to hurricane intensity. The government urged the potentially impacted citizens to take preparations for the storm, many of whom bought supplies at local <b>hardware</b> <b>stores.</b> Residents installed storm shutters, while boat owners moved their yachts to safer locations. An emergency shelter was prepared on the island. Prior to the arrival of the storm, officials canceled bus and ferry service, and also closed all schools and {{government of}}fices on the day of impact. The Bermuda International Airport was also closed.|$|E

5|$|At 1200UTC on October23, about 24hours before Wilma {{made its}} closest {{approach}} to the archipelago, the government of The Bahamas issued a hurricane warning for the northwestern portion of the territory, including the Abacos, Andros Island, Berry Islands, Bimini, Eleuthera, Grand Bahama, and New Providence. The government of The Bahamas advised citizens to rush preparations to completion, though many failed to fully prepare, believing Wilma would pass through {{the region as a}} tropical storm. Many homes failed to board windows or apply hurricane shutters, as well. Officials ordered evacuations for the eastern and western portion of Grand Bahama island, and established multiple shelters on the island. Evacuations were minimal; it is estimated that between 300 and 1,000 people left. As most people failed to prepare sufficiently for the hurricane, <b>hardware</b> <b>stores</b> and food markets were generally well-stocked.|$|E
5|$|In {{common with}} most suburbs of the Metropolitan Borough of Gateshead, its economy is {{dominated}} by the economies of Newcastle–upon–Tyne and Gateshead town centre. This is reflected in terms of independent commercial space; retail floor space in the suburb totals 1% of that available in the whole metropolitan borough. There are 33 retail units concentrated on Old Durham Road, which provide some employment, though these are {{at the lower end of}} the spectrum and provide little choice. There is a good provision of <b>hardware</b> <b>stores,</b> fast–food outlets and hairdressers, a butcher's shop, a greengrocer and a supermarket, but there is no bakery, bank nor building society and the Post Office has closed. The retail units were domestic properties, so many are too small for retail purposes and around 20% are vacant.|$|E
5|$|Significant {{action was}} taken along the Gulf Coast as the threat the storm posed, {{predicted}} to come ashore at Category Four strength, became more urgent.

At least 2,000 volunteers staffed 115 Red Cross shelters in Louisiana, Texas, Mississippi, and Alabama. More than 20,000people stayed in those shelters. The Red Cross also sent over 160,000 meals to the area. A total of 3,000 prison inmates in Texas were evacuated to safer inland locations. The launch of Space Shuttle Atlantis was delayed for five days when the Kennedy Space Center was threatened by the storm, {{the first time a}} launch in Florida had been delayed because of weather in Houston. Stores across the warning area were very busy in advance of the storm.

By 1900UTC, once Hurricane Gustav turned towards the north away from the Lesser Antilles, all watches and warnings were discontinued.|$|E
