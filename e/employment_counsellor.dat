40|$|Objective: The {{pilot study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the Disability Open Employment Services (DOES), now called the Disability Employment Network (DEN), developed by the Australian Federal Government to assist clients with health disabilities to seek and maintain employment. This {{is the first time}} this type of programme has been evaluated in a service delivery setting in Australia. Method: This study employed a mixed method design for inquiry. Findings: Male participants reported less symptom interference with work duties than females. There was also an association of gender on mental health with males reporting lower levels of mental health than females. There was an association of employment goal on the degree to which symptoms interfered with work duties where those whose goal was full time work experienced significantly more interference from their symptoms than other individuals. Key findings relate to the fragmentation of current services and the variability in the educational preparation of <b>employment</b> <b>counsellors.</b> Implications and Conclusions: Implications for practice relate to the enhancement of the provision of employment services to people with a mental illness. Further research is required into the factors which clients perceive as enabling or inhibiting their participation in employment support services and further knowledge is also required about how employment support services and mental health organisations can work together as interlocked services...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{wide variety}} of {{practice}} in European PES in institutional design, services provided, welfare and unemployment benefit regimes and welfare spending. Some PES are responsible only for labour market services to the unemployed, while others are also responsible for the administration of unemployment and other welfare benefits, services to employers and occupational or worker licensing. Despite this variation, recent years have seen the increasing adoption of ‘activation’ as an approach to delivering labour market services and the use of performance management or Management By Objectives (MBO) as a management practice. The use of performance management has become more critical and widespread as PES resources have become more limited and there is a resulting increasing emphasis on demonstrating the impact of PES interventions as well as value for money. This report considers the variety of practice across EU Member States and makes suggestions about how all EU PES might learn from one another to strengthen their own practice, specifically in relation to labour market services to jobseekers.

40|$|The authors {{make two}} distinct, but related, arguments. First, their {{empirical}} studies - conducted in three antenatal clinics in inner-city Johannesburg - demonstrate {{a strong correlation}} between (1) the government's failure to provide adequate remuneration to and secure <b>employment</b> of lay <b>counsellors</b> for the provision of HIV counseling and treatment and (2) the failure of many women and children to receive timely medical interventions. The data show that late payment of HIV lay counsellors has a devastating impact on HIV testing in these three clinics. The evidence also demonstrates that such timely HIV prevention and treatment is required for the survival of pregnant women and their neonates. Lay counsellors - through no fault of their own - are often unable to make these timely interventions. Second, the authors contend that the government's conscious deployment of inadequately remunerated and institutionally marginalized lay counsellors instead of health care professionals (who had previously undertaken counselling and testing) constitutes a retrogressive measure in terms of s 27 of the Constitution. In short, despite the government's commitment to an expanded, more efficacious ART rollout, it is currently delivering less health care - not more - and less access to adequate health care - not more or better - to this cohort of patients with HIV. Such retrogressive measures offend the Court's own understanding of the delivery of this constitutionally-mandated public good to pregnant women with HIV and their infants. The failure of the government to provide adequate and timely remuneration and secure <b>employment</b> to lay <b>counsellors</b> rises to the level required for finding an unjustifiable limitation of s 27 's right of access to health care services. As the authors show, the violation flows from the improperly remunerated, insufficiently trained and generally marginalized manner in which lay counsellors are (mis) managed by a public health system that has chosen to supplant well-trained professionals with well-intentioned non-professionals in the delivery of essential components of now constitutionally-mandated ART and PMTCT programme...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MA (Psychology)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2007. South Africa {{has been}} a {{democratic}} country {{for more than ten}} years, and still transformation is not visible in many areas. Psychological services are inaccessible and unaffordable for the larger part of South-Africans. The B. Psych degree was specifically implemented to address this problem. The course aims to give graduates access to registration as counsellors at the HPCSA in order to bring psychological services to people more easily. This study thus explores the employment patterns of registered counsellors in South Africa. These counsellors have been trained to deliver services within the primary health care sector because most people use services within this sector. Only eight percent of registered counsellors in South Africa are working within this sector. Most registered counsellors are working in the education sector or the private sector. Counsellors that are working in the education sector are primarily delivering educational services and not psychological services. Counsellors that are working in the private sector are contributing to making services inaccessible and unaffordable to many people. The absence of workers in the primary healthcare sector is mainly because there is little <b>employment</b> for registered <b>counsellors</b> within this sector. The findings of this study are in accordance with the findings of Kotze (2005) that accessibility to psychological services did not significantly change with the implementation of the B.

Where-ever law ends, tyranny begins, {{if the law}} be transgressed to another's harm; and whosoever in {{authority}} exceeds the power given him by the law, and makes use of the force he has under his command, to compass that upon the subject, which the law allows not, ceases in {{that to be a}} magistrate; and, acting without authority, may be opposed, as any other man, who by force invades the right of another. This is acknowledged in subordinate magistrates. He that hath authority to seize my person in the street, may be opposed as a thief and a robber, if he endeavours to break into my house to execute a writ, notwithstanding that I know he has such a warrant, and such a legal authority, as will impower him to arrest me abroad. And why this should not hold in the highest, {{as well as in the}} most inferior magistrate, I would gladly be informed. Is it reasonable, that the eldest brother, because he has the greatest part of his father's estate, should thereby have a right to take away any of his younger brothers portions? or that a rich man, who possessed a whole country, should from thence have a right to seize, when he pleased, the cottage and garden of his poor neighbour? The being rightfully possessed of great power and riches, exceedingly beyond the greatest part of the sons of Adam, is so far from being an excuse, much less a reason, for rapine and oppression, which the endamaging another without authority is, that it is a great aggravation of it: for the exceeding the bounds of authority is no more a right in a great, than in a petty officer; no more justifiable in a king than a constable; but is so much the worse in him, in that he has more trust put in him, has already a much greater share than the rest of his brethren, and is supposed, from the advantages of his education, <b>employment,</b> and <b>counsellors,</b> to be more knowing in the measures of right and wrong.|$|R

30|$|Different {{specific}} actions {{are included in}} the activation strategies depending on labour market conditions but also the capacity of the PES and other service providers. As part of job-search assistance and monitoring, most OECD countries follow a practice of intensive obligatory interviews between the jobseeker and an <b>employment</b> <b>counsellor.</b> However, the frequency of such interviews varies, with five OECD requiring an interview on a monthly basis or less (Czech Republic, France, Korea, Slovak Republic and the UK). Beneficiaries are also required to report regularly on their job-search effort, while the PES refers unemployed clients to vacant jobs. The PES also sets up back-to-work agreements or individual action plans as the joblessness spell lengthens and offer tailored re-employment programmes to prevent loss of motivation, skills and employability. In a few countries – Australia, Denmark, Sweden and the UK – participation in re-employment programmes is compulsory after a period of unsuccessful job search {{to reduce the risk of}} either long-term unemployment or labour market exit.|$|E
40|$|The overall aim of {{the thesis}} was to acquire an {{increased}} knowledge of co-operation between different rehabilitation actors {{in the provision of}} vocational rehabilitation (VR). One aim was to investigate the differences in effects on employment between clients rehabilitated according to a systematic multi-professional cross-sector co-operation model (SMCVR) and clients subjected to conventional co-operation. A second aim was to investigate the communicative process in the rehabilitation group meetings and female clients experiences during the VR process. The studies used material collected from two intervention projects, enabling natural experimental designs. Fifty-one unemployed clients with various work limitations, who underwent intervention with SMCVR I model during a period of 18 months, were individually matched into pairs using records from the Swedish Public Employment Service. Three matched comparison groups, representing the conventional way of co-operation between VR actors, were formed at local, county, and national levels. A distinctive feature of the SMCVR I model was that the client s rehabilitation was planned by multi-professional cross-sector rehabilitation groups consisting of the client, a rehabilitation official from the social insurance office, an occupational therapist from a primary care unit, an <b>employment</b> <b>counsellor</b> from the county employment office and a social worker from the municipal social administration office. The main effect variable was the number of persons in employment. ANOVA for repeated measures for binary responses and a logistic regression model was used. The VR actors involved in the SMCVR II model were a public employer (a municipality), the social insurance office and an occupational health service. The material consisted of 22 systematic multi-professional cross-sector rehabilitation group meetings with clients who underwent intervention (20 women, 2 men). An observer attended each meeting to observe communication; each meeting was tape-recorded and subsequently transcribed. The analysis was based upon these transcriptions, using content analysis. A larger proportion of clients subjected to this particular form of developed co-operation studied (SMCVR I) became employed during the first 2 years compared with similar clients in neighboring municipalities or among those in a national register; the higher employment rate showed a peak two years after closure of the intervention; the chance of becoming employed after rehabilitation in the 2 -year follow-up was roughly twice as high as that in both comparison groups with conventional co-operation. There was a difference between the study group, the national and county comparison groups on 6 measuring occasions over the period from 1 year following closure of the intervention to the 6 th year after. The logistic regression model showed that the clients with mental/social work limitations were at a greater risk of being unemployed after VR than clients with somatic work limitations. In the SMCVR II model the topics discussed primarily concerned the client s situation regarding the field of medical and health care, previous and new work, and social insurance and none of the professionals dominated the meetings. The clients had the highest percentage of utterances. Clients were allowed ample scope to address their own requirements, thoughts and feelings. Adaptation was a pervading theme in the discussions during the observations. The importance of work for the clients emerged as a sub-theme; positive and neutral aspects occurred. The conflict between health and work was an ever-present theme of substantial importance for VR. Support from the employer and fellow workers during the client s return to work was important. This support appeared as both a positive and a negative force in the VR. In conclusion, systematic multi-professional cross-sector co-operation which can be performed without any changes in law leads to seeing a greater proportion of clients in employment {{over a long period of}} time compared with co-operation as usual. It is possible to achieve a creative communicative climate in multi-professional cross-sector rehabilitation group meetings, which can favor good results in VR...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the career choices of young adults (ages 18 through 40) with {{mobility}} impairments and the experiences they had throughout their career-selection process. The {{purpose of the study}} was: To find the inhibitory and furthering factors of the career choices of people with mobility impairments from their own perspective, with a special focus on how various factors affected the process over time. The method for collecting {{the results of this study}} was biographical interviews. The main theories of the study were Sense of Coherence, Self-efficacy, Learned Helplessness, Social Role Valorization and The Four Rooms of Change. The results show that mobility impairment affects career choices and that the effect is more often inhibitory than it is furthering. Structural factors, such as how the respondents are treated by other people, as well as rules and material barriers (stairs, mal-functioning elevators, etc.) are found to be more limiting than the body itself. Being over-protected is a main inhibitory factor which can contribute strongly to low self-efficacy and drainage of self-image for the respondents.   The goal of the respondents is to obtain independence and a job based on their own terms, and not a social care career. This goal was found to form a vital resistance resource versus adversity and obstacles. The respondents consider themselves to be overprotected by society (by parents, teachers, career <b>counsellors,</b> <b>employment</b> officers, etc.) in relation to their career choices, and they would like not to be.   Forskningsfinansiärer: Torsten Söderbergs Stiftelse och Ragnar Söderbergs Stiftelse</p...|$|R
40|$|To examine stress amongst a {{group of}} midwives, and {{establish}} whether perceived occupational stress actually originates from sources not connected to the work environment. Although many research projects have looked at stress within the N. H. S. very little research has previously been done addressing midwives. Midwives working in an N. H. S. Trust maternity unit. The sickness rates amongst this group were believed to have increased during a recent period of organisational restructuring, with "stress" cited as the main cause for absence. A random sample of one hundred midwives completed three questionnaires. One on basic demographic data, a second on stress analysis - The professional life scale (Fontana 1989), and a third on life style and experiences, which may contribute to stress and anxiety (Holmes and Rahe 1967). Only 6 % of midwives scored high on the stress questionnaire. 47 % scored low and 47 % scored moderately. However, 25 % scored high on the life style and experiences questionnaire. The results indicate a predisposition to ill health {{as a consequence of}} stress and life changes. There was no correlation between stress and life change scores. High stress scores were not associated with life changes or problems exclusively at home. The replies may suggest a need to analyse personality and individual coping mechanisms as a predisposing factor in relation to stress. Stress was related to organisational change and also to home - work conflicts. Personality and/or individual coping mechanisms may be a major contributing factor in determining the way an individual perceives and copes with a potentially stressful situation. It is possible that the personality characteristics of the midwives are the most important determining factors for their perception of, and experience of, stress. Whilst the total amount of life changes itself does seem to influence the stress level, the amount of change required to produce a physiological stress response in each person appears to be dependent on the individual's perception and coping mechanisms. The sickness rate is measured by management every week, and the absence reported by staff as being due to stress has increased dramatically since the organisational changes were introduced. The current way of thinking within this and possibly other large organisations appears to be the <b>employment</b> of stress <b>counsellors</b> and staff support workers. From these results, this may not appear to be the most appropriate {{way to deal with the}} issue of stress...|$|R

Studie- och yrkesvägledare fungerar som en länk mellan eleverna och branscherna där det är viktigt för vägledaren att ha kännedom om branschernas synsätt. Studien är genomförd med kvalitativ metod där tio APL-handledare på byggarbetsplatser i Värmlands län intervjuats. Intervjuerna är analyserade enligt innehållsanalys och ställs mot Illeris teorier om lärande och kompetens. Analyserna är inramade av Bourdieus habitusteori. Resultaten visar att APL-handledare har svårt att definiera vad yrkeskunnande är och därmed har uppfattningarna skiljts åt gällande vad som förväntas av APL-elever. Det framkommer även att egenskaper som förväntas av APL-eleverna närmast kan definieras som Bourdieus kapital än konkreta yrkesfärdigheter. Våra resultat visar dessutom att APL-handledarna inte har någon uppfattning om vad som står i examensmålen för bygg- och anläggningsprogrammet. Vi hoppas att denna studie ska bidra till en ökad förståelse för studie- och yrkesvägledarens uppdrag som ibland blir en medlande länk mellan de olika aktörerna; skolan, arbetslivet och eleven. The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} what building and construction workers who mentor students from the vocational-education program of building and construction think about the students’ vocational skills. The study also hope to ascertain whether the construction workers have noticed any difference in the students’ vocational skills after the school reform of 2011. As aspiring guidance counsellors we aim to play the role of a bridge between the students and their chosen field of <b>employment.</b> For guidance <b>counsellors</b> it is important to have a solid grasp of the values and views found in different fields of employment and to manage the expectations of the students. For this study, we used a qualitative method in which we interviewed ten mentors on construction sites across the county of Wermland. The content of the interviews was later analysed and compared to Illeris’ theory of knowledge and competence. As a theoretical framework, we also used Bourdieu’s theory of Habitus. The results show that the mentors had difficulty defining vocational skills in a meaningful and concise manner, which leads to students finding it difficult to know what is expected of them. The characteristics of the students are better defined in Bourdieu’s theory of habitus. The results also revealed that the mentors did not have a clear picture of what was expected of a student and did not understand fully what the student would need to learn in order to pass the relevant examinations at the end of the course. We hope that this study will contribute to a clearer understanding of the role of the guidance counsellor, which in this case is to act as a bridge between those already working in the construction industry and the students hoping to work within the construction industry after they have graduated...|$|R
