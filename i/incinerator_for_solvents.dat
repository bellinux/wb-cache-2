50|$|The Newhaven ERF is an <b>incinerator</b> <b>for</b> the {{treatment}} of up to 210,000 tonnes per annum of East Sussex's municipal solid waste. The facility, built by Veolia Environmental Services, was approved by planners at the Conservative-controlled East Sussex County Council.|$|R

25|$|Use of <b>incinerators</b> <b>for</b> waste {{management}} is controversial. The debate over incinerators typically involves business interests (representing both waste generators and incinerator firms), government regulators, environmental activists and local citizens who must weigh the economic appeal of local industrial activity with their concerns over {{health and environmental}} risk.|$|R

50|$|During {{the early}} part of the 20th century the river and the valley {{continued}} to be neglected. 31 separate sewage treatment facilities were built along the river. Over 20 places in the valley and adjacent ravines were used as landfills for garbage and industrial refuse. In 1917, the Don Destructor was built beside the Don just north of Dundas Ave. East. It was used as a garbage <b>incinerator</b> <b>for</b> 52 years burning about 50,000 tonnes per year.|$|R

50|$|On September 11, 1957, a {{plutonium}} fire {{occurred in}} one of the gloveboxes used to handle radioactive materials, igniting the combustible rubber gloves and plexiglas windows of the box. Metallic plutonium is a fire hazard and pyrophoric; under the right conditions it may ignite in air at room temperature. The accident resulted in the contamination of Building 771, the release of plutonium into the atmosphere, and caused $818,600 in damage. An <b>incinerator</b> <b>for</b> plutonium-contaminated waste was installed in Building 771 in 1958.|$|R

40|$|Fluidized bed waste <b>incinerators</b> remain popular <b>for</b> {{industrial}} waste incineration, although the demand <b>for</b> these <b>incinerators</b> has been decreasing for municipal waste incineration. This {{is partly because}} the release of dioxins from waste incineration has recently become a significant social problem in Japan. NKK has continually improved fluid-ized bed technology to solve the dioxin problem, {{as well as to}} obtain heat recovery from waste combustion. Our most recently delivered fluidized bed <b>incinerator</b> <b>for</b> municipal waste incorporated these improvements and achieved very low dioxin concentrations of 0. 00058 ng(TEQ) /Nm 3 at the stack. This result is equivalent to that of very large-scale stoker type incineration plants. Furthermore, NKK developed technology for effectively recovering heat from the furnace bed to achieve highly efficient power generation. The estimated corrosion rate of the furnace bed boiler tubes is as low as 0. 4 mm/year...|$|R

The design element to which greater importance is ascribed to the incinerator operating temperature and residence time of the waste inside it. The incinerator operating temperature should be between 850 and 1. 100 ° C to ensure almost complete destruction of the organic compounds in the waste and prevent the emission of pollutants, mainly dioxins and furans, the residence time is three (3) minutes and silica sand is proposed to be used as support material, to comply with environmental regulations and health techniques. <b>Incinerator</b> dimensions <b>for</b> 1 ton hr- 1 treatment capacity are determined by the residence time, volume and density of the waste to be incinerated, and were 514 mm in diameter and 6. 650 mm of high...|$|R
40|$|The Army’s current {{chemical}} weapons (CW) disposal program involves robotic, machine disassembly {{of the chemical}} weapon as appropriate for each specific munition. The various waste materials from disassembly are incinerated separately. These include the chemical agent, explosives and propellants, empty munitions and nonexplosive (storage) containers, and shipping and packing materials (dunnage). Preliminary separation produces individual waste streams that are relatively homogeneous, which makes it feasible to optimize conditions for the incineration of each. To handle the various waste streams produced by disassembly, four different furnace systems are required: <b>Incinerator</b> <b>for</b> the liquid chemical agent and process liquid waste; Rotary kiln furnace {{for the destruction of}} explosives and propellants, with an accompanying heated discharge conveyer to remove leftover materials; Metal parts furnace to decontaminate by incineration the empty bulk containers, shells, and bombs; and Dunnage <b>incinerator</b> <b>for</b> the combustion of waste packaging. The resulting gases and other products of incineration are treated with a variety of modern pollution abatement equipment, including a quench tower, venturi scrubber, scrubber tower, demister, and for the dunnage furnace, a baghouse for removal of particulate. Brine produced by the scrubbers is evaporated, and the resulting salts are packed in drums for eventual landfill. The final products that will require disposal such as landfill are scrap metal, drums of salt, and ash (l). The time required to dispose of the stockpiles at the eight continental U. S. sites after the incinerators begin to work was estimated in the 1988 Programmatic Environmental Impact Statement (PEIS) to be from 11 months (at Lexington-Blue Grass Arm...|$|R

We tackle this inevitable asymmetry from a responsibility and equity viewpoint: the host should not {{be perceived as a}} "victim". To realize this objective, we design a method to share the total cost (the disutility of the host plus the construction cost) in a way that bypasses the natural asymmetry of the problem.
