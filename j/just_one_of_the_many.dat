25|$|The {{end of the}} seventeenth-century and the {{beginning}} of the eighteenth-century witnessed an increasing concern for vices and immorality spreading all over the country. There was a general sense of falling into the worst possible form of behaviour and a common feeling that avarice, vice, idleness, blasphemy, vagrancy and crime were all entangles together pushing people (poor and wealthy, young and old) into a slippery slope to damnation. A drastic social reformation was required and, at the end of the seventeenth-century, societies for the reformation of manners started emerging with a rank of proper paid agents operating locally. Indeed, Defoe was <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>many</b> eighteenth-century voices believing that at least part of the falling of the offender was due to a weakening of the social and moral values of the English society.|$|E

The first nationwide recognition of African-American quiltmaking came when the Gee's Bend quilting community was celebrated in an exhibition that opened in 2002 and travelled to many museums, including the Smithsonian. Gee's Bend is a small, isolated community of African-Americans in southern Alabama with a quiltmaking tradition that goes back several generations and is characterized by pattern improvisation, multiple patterning, bright and contrasting colors, visual motion, and a lack of rules. The contributions made by Harriet Powers and others quilters of Gee's Bend, Alabama have been recognized by the US Postal Service with a series of stamps. The communal nature of the quilting process (and how it can bring together women of varied races and backgrounds) was honored in the series of stamps.|$|E

25|$|Earlier {{societies}} of hunter-gatherer tribes had no social stratification, and later {{societies of}} the Bronze Age had noticeable social stratification, which saw {{the creation of}} occupational specialization, the state and social classes of individuals who were of the elite ruling or religious classes, full-time warriors and wealthy merchants, contrasted with those individuals {{on the other end}} of the economic spectrum who were poor, enslaved and hungry. In between these two economic models (the hunter-gatherer tribes and Bronze Age civilisations) we find the later Neolithic and Eneolithic societies such as the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, where the first indications of social stratification began to be found. However, it would be a mistake to overemphasise the impact of social stratification in the Cucuteni-Trypillia culture, since it was still (even in its later phases) very much an egalitarian society. And of course, social stratification was <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>many</b> aspects of what is regarded as a fully established civilised society, which began to appear in the Bronze Age.|$|E

Locations in New York City included the Hotel Chelsea and Times Square's all-male burlesque Gaiety Theatre (dancers from theatre participated in one of the book's photo sessions), whereas in Miami the majority of the sessions were shot at a house Madonna had purchased just before starting the project, and in several beaches and streets. One morning during the four-day Florida shoot Madonna was prancing around her 14-bedroom house in Miami completely naked, when someone jokingly suggested she go out on the street, then, according to Baron [...] "the next thing we're in the street" [...] where allegedly [...] "cars screeched to a halt, motorists whistled, and one entranced cyclist fell off his bike." [...] This was <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>many</b> crazy episodes that took place during the shooting of the book. According to Baron, during the photo shoots [...] "'d do something crazy and then we'd come up with something even crazier". One of the most shocking photographs made for the book, which featured two women in post-punk attire flanking Madonna with one of them holding a knife to Madonna's crotch, was dismissed as it was considered too violent. At some point, while the book was being produced, some of the photographs were stolen, but were quickly recovered by the FBI. According to New York magazine, there were approximately 80,000photographs taken for the book, but only a handful made the final cut. The printing of the book was extended for 15days making the total production process last about eight months.|$|E
2500|$|The {{most common}} {{perception}} of a volcano is of a conical mountain, spewing lava and poisonous gases from a crater at its summit; however, this describes <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>many</b> types of volcano. [...] The features of volcanoes are much more complicated and their structure and behavior depends {{on a number of}} factors. Some volcanoes have rugged peaks formed by lava domes rather than a summit crater while others have landscape features such as massive plateaus. Vents that issue volcanic material (including lava and ash) and gases (mainly steam and magmatic gases) can develop anywhere on the landform and may give rise to smaller cones such as Puu Ōō on a flank of Hawaii's Kīlauea.|$|E

Greg Egan's novel Quarantine, billed as [...] "a story of quantum catastrophe", features an alternative solution to the paradox: [...] in Egan's version of quantum mechanics, the wave function does not collapse naturally. [...] Only certain living things—human beings among them—collapse the wave function of things they observe. [...] Humans are therefore highly dangerous to other lifeforms which require the full diversity of uncollapsed wavefunctions to survive.|$|E

In its review of the album, Rolling Stone called the song a [...] "radiant ballad", noting that [...] "Few bands can marshal such sublime power, but it's <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>many</b> moments on Achtung Baby when we're reminded why, before these guys were the butt of cynical jokes, they were rock & roll heroes—as they still are." [...] Niall Stokes of Hot Press gave an enthusiastic review of the song, calling {{it one of the}} album's tracks [...] "whose potency defies equivocations". Stokes said the song, both upon initial and repeated listens, [...] "seems transcendent, a magnificent synthesis of elements, words and music, rhythm, instrumentation arrangement and intonation combine to create something that speaks a language beyond logic, the definitive language of emotional truth". He said the melody was reminiscent of Led Zeppelin and the vocals evoked memories of Al Green and the Rolling Stones circa [...] "Sympathy for the Devil". Stokes could not single out what made the song so [...] "utterly inspirational", but said it was [...] "soul music that avoids the obvious cliches of the genre and cuts to the core".|$|E
2500|$|The Foundations {{would prove}} to be a seminal work in German nationalism; due to its success, aided by Chamberlain's {{association}} with the Wagner circle, its ideas of Aryan supremacy and a struggle against Jewish influence spread widely across the German state {{at the beginning of the}} century. If it did not form the framework of later National Socialist ideology, at the very least it provided its adherents with a seeming intellectual justification. Many of Chamberlain's ideas such as his emphasis on a racial struggle between Aryans vs. Jews for world domination; his championing of [...] "world power status" [...] for Germany; his call for a [...] "planned economy" [...] (something realized in 1936 when Hitler brought in the First Four Year Plan which saw the German state take over the economy); his vision of Germany becoming the Volksgemeinschaft (people's community"); his demand for a [...] "third way" [...] between capitalism and socialism; his total opposition to democracy and his nostalgia for an agrarian lifestyle were central to National Socialism. The only National Socialist idea that Chamberlain missed was lebensraum (living space), the perceived need for Germany to colonize Eastern Europe while displacing the existing population to make room for Aryan colonists. However, there were differences in that Chamberlain was always a monarchist and he believed that when his friend Hitler came to power, he would restore the monarchy and put his other friend Wilhelm II back on the throne. Had Chamberlain lived to see the Third Reich, he likely would have been disappointed that Hitler did not carry out the restoration of the monarchy that he so desired. Moreover, Chamberlain was <b>just</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>many</b> völkische thinkers who influenced Hitler.|$|E
