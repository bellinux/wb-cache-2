50|$|In the {{northwest}} of Swaziland, gold was discovered, drawing {{a large number}} of miners and settlers in the area. Gold deposits were first recorded around Piggs Peak during modern times in 1872 and in 1884 a gold-bearing reef was discovered in the hills to the west by the prospector, William Pigg, after whom the town is named. Other mining adventures took place in the neighbouring town of Bulembu, where later on, asbestos was mined. The town of Ngwenya on the western border of Swaziland with South Africa, is home to the oldest known <b>iron-ore</b> <b>mine</b> in the world. Commercial scale mining took place in the mine until 1977.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, United States Steel {{formed the}} Québec Cartier Mining Company to {{construct}} an <b>iron-ore</b> <b>mine</b> in the iron-rich Quebec-Labrador Trough, a 40 by 600 mi long band which cuts through the vast Canadian Shield. Earlier exploration by mine geologists discovered a large deposit in the Trough near Lac Jeannine, about 186 mi north of {{the small town of}} Shelter Bay, which was located on the northern banks of the St. Lawrence River. In 1959, Shelter Bay, now renamed Port Cartier, was ready for use allowing easier delivery of equipment for the mine and railway, which were still under construction. Construction was completed on the 190 mi railway line between Port Cartier and Lac Jeannine on December 19, 1960. The first trainload of iron concentrate left Lac Jeannine on December 16, 1960. Concentrate was stockpiled at Port Cartier while the mine and concentrator were gearing up for full production and the first shipload of concentrate departed the port on July 5, 1961.|$|E
5000|$|Designed {{to produce}} low-grade {{taconite}} pellets used for steelmaking, the project under consideration in northern Wisconsin might yield up to 2 {{billion tons of}} ore across the 22-mile long lease property, according to company figures. The $1.5 billion project (in terms of taxable revenue) sits amongst the remote Penokee Hills south of Lake Superior, {{and most of the}} initial work is to be done in a 4 to 5-mile section near the town of Mellen, 20 miles south of the Bad River Band tribal reservation in Odanah, Wi. With lease rights covering over 21,000 acres, the project would be the largest open pit <b>iron-ore</b> <b>mine</b> in the world, and requires legislative action in the Wisconsin State Legislature to advance.Hurley, Wi {{has a long history of}} mining in the area. Mining began somewhere around 1880 when the first iron was discovered. Both shaft and open mining, like the process proposed by Gogebic Taconite, have been recorded since the late 1800s in the area. Hurley, Wi is more known for its lake effect snow falls, miles of snowmobiling trails, hunting, fishing and local ski hills, but that wasn't always the case. The entire area, both historically and culturally, is an area of both mining and logging. The Hurley High School mascott is the [...] "Midgets" [...] due to a team that went to state that was made up of short players. A mainstay food in the area is the pasty, which was brought over from the English miners to the area in the late 1800s. You will find bars named the Iron Nugget, Freddie's Old Time Saloon, and the Iron Horse Inn which encompass the rich history of the area. For decades in the late 19th century and into the 1920s, the Gogebic was one of the nation’s chief sources of iron. Iron from the Gogebic helped to fuel the industrial boom in the Upper Midwest during these years. By 1930 mining was winding down in the area. The mines began closing in amid a national economy suffering from the Great Depression. The result was widespread economic devastation in the Gogebic Range. The Montreal and Cary mines closed in the 1960s when the steel industry changed from using high-grade iron ore from deep shaft mines to using abundant taconite ore that could be economically mined by the open-pit method. At the time of closing, the Montreal and Cary mines were producing ore from workings nearly one mile deep. The last iron ore from the Gogebic Iron Range in Wisconsin was shipped from the Cary Mine in Hurley in 1965. The mines can still be seen in the historical mining houses along the Carey stretch and Montreal areas. The mining industry sustained the area for 85 years with no known environmental effects.|$|E

40|$|In {{the early}} 1980 s, the world steel market collapsed. Since the almost {{exclusive}} use of iron-ore is in steel production, many <b>iron-ore</b> <b>mines</b> {{had to be}} shut down. We divide the major iron-ore producing countries into groups based on the threat of closure faced by <b>iron-ore</b> <b>mines</b> in the respective country. In countries where mines faced no threat of closure, the iron-ore industry {{had little or no}} productivity gain over the decade. In countries where mines faced a large threat of closure, the industry typically had productivity gains ranging from 50 to 100 percent, gains that were unprecedented. We then argue that these productivity increases were not driven by new technology or by the closing of low productivity mines. Hence, the productivity gains were driven by continuing mines, using existing technology, increasing their productivity in order to stay in operation...|$|R
