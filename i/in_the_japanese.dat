5|$|As the game's {{dialogue}} {{consists of}} a lot of wordplay and misunderstandings, Smith would analyze scenes before writing them: he would see what the scenes were trying to accomplish, and where the beats in them were. After he had the structure of a scene in his head, he would write it; at times he was able {{to make use of the}} original Japanese dialogue, but most of the time he had to come up with new ideas himself. At several points, the English wordplay was inspired by the wordplay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> version. At some points, it was not possible to do wordplay in the same places as <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> version, so Smith would change the structure of the scene slightly. At other points, Smith came up with a joke or funny line, and changed the scene to make the joke work. Around half of the jokes were rewritten based on the characters present in the scene, rather than being translations of the Japanese jokes.|$|E

In one cutscene, Hercules fights the Hydra and uses his sword on its head, which eventually releases green blood from its mouth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Japanese</b> version; this was later changed into drool in the English version.
