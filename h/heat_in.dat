40|$|The aims of this {{research}} were determining polyphenol amount in tea from Hibiscus rosa sinensis flowers made by <b>heating</b> <b>in</b> oven and <b>heating</b> <b>in</b> a hot plate and also determining the comparation between polyphenol amount from Hibiscus rosa sinensis flower, tea leaf, and rosella flower. This research was designed as experimental research with 3 samples and 1 variable. Samples were fresh Hibiscus rosa sinensis flower and tea from this flower made by <b>heating</b> <b>in</b> oven and <b>heating</b> <b>in</b> a hot plate. The variable was polyphenol amount in tea made from Hibiscus rosa sinensis flower. The samples were Hibiscus rosa sinensis flowers that had red and orange single sepal. These samples were put from a gate at Gadjah Mada University. They were taken by purpossive random sampling with criteria i. e. the flowers were fresh and not influenced by any diseasses. Qualitative and quantitative analyses were done together by adding Folin-Ciocalteau reagent in fresh Hibiscus rosa sinensis flower sepal.

40|$|Conductor inks {{containing}} {{silver and}} palladium, used in ceramic co-fired circuits, sometimes undergo an anomalously large expansion during <b>heating</b> <b>in</b> the temperature range where interdiffusion occurs. Therefore, the interdiffusion {{of silver and}} palladium was studied during <b>heating</b> <b>in</b> both air and argon using both powder and foil samples. Measurements on a powder compact made of a mixture of Ag and Pd (80 % Ag) particles indicated that a very rapid expansion occurred between 375 and 400 C when <b>heated</b> <b>in</b> air but only a slight expansion occurred in Ar. A pre-alloyed powder with the same composition did not expand during <b>heating.</b> <b>In</b> situ high temperature x-ray diffraction studies indicated that both powders oxidized during <b>heating</b> <b>in</b> air, with the mixture oxidizing more and that interdiffusion occurred between 300 and 500 C. Microstructural examination indicated that larger particles with internal pores had formed <b>in</b> the mixture <b>heated</b> <b>in</b> air to 375 C due to rearrangement during interdiffusion. A porous region much thicker than the original silver film formed on a palladium foil sample when it was <b>heated</b> <b>in</b> air, whereas in inert atmosphere pores formed only in the silver film, indicating a Kirkendall effect occurs in both cases. Based on these results, {{it was concluded that}} the expansion of the Ag-Pd powder mixture was due to interdiffusion in the presence of oxygen, not solely to the oxidation of the Pd...|$|R
