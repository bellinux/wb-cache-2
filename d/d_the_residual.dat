40|$|Cell {{invasion}} by the protozoan parasite Trypanosoma cruzi involves activation of host signaling pathways and the recruitment and fusion of lysosomes at the parasite entry site. A major signaling pathway regulating invasion of fibroblasts, epithelial cells, and myoblasts involves mobilization of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores and requires {{the activity of}} a T. cruzi serine peptidase, oligopeptidase B (OPB). Deletion of the OPB gene results in a marked defect in trypomastigote virulence, consistent with a greatly reduced cell invasion capacity.

The capacity of triggering elevation in host cell cyclic AMP (cAMP), however, was unaltered in OPBnull trypomastigotes.

40|$|Neither age-related {{osteoporosis}} nor {{the increasing}} incidence of falls with age sufficiently explain the exponential {{increase in the}} incidence of hip fracture with aging. We propose that four conditions must be satisfied in order for a fall to cause a hip fracture: (a) the fatter must be oriented to impact near the hip; (b) protective responses must fail; (c) local soft tissues must absorb less energy than necessary to prevent fracture, and (<b>d)</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> energy of the fall applied to the proximal femur must exceed its strength. All of these events become more likely with aging and lead to an exponential rise in the risk of hip fracture with advancing age. This model also suggests that a combination of measurements of neuromuscular function and of bone strength may be the most accurate approach to assessing the risk of hip fracture. HIP fractures are common, disabling, and sometimes fatalevents, and their incidence rises exponentially with age (1, 2).

40|$|A complex {{segregation}} analysis of systolic and {{diastolic blood pressure}} has been performed on pedigree data from rural populations inhabiting Middle Dalmatian islands of Brač, Hvar and Korčula and the Pelješac peninsula. The purpose of the performed analysis was to possibly elucidate a signal of a large-effect gene responsible for high prevalence of hypertension present in this population (the age-adjusted prevalence of developed hypertension being 31. 82 % in males and 28. 23 % in females). The analysis was performed on a sample of 389 two- and three-generation families consisting of 2 to 19 observed individuals (1126 examinees in total, 526 males and 600 females, aged 17 to 83). Since the examinees {{were randomly selected from}} census data encompassing 22. 6 % of the total population – the family relations having been established afterwards – the selected sample can be considered representative for the examined populations. By applying the usual transmission probability tests, the major gene model has been accepted for systolic as well as for diastolic blood pressure. The most parsimonious models showed that: a) inheritance of blood pressure in the Middle Dalmatia population {{can be attributed to the}} effect of a major gene responsible for 34 % (systolic) and 36 % (diastolic) blood pressure variation; b) alleles of that major gene act in co-dominant fashion; c) allele frequency for high blood pressure (A 2) is 18 % (systolic) and 15 % (diastolic blood pressure); and <b>d)</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> (non-major gene) familial correlation is negligible and can be constrained to zero.

40|$|The {{efficacy}} of adenovirus-mediated gene therapy {{for treatment of}} metastatic B 16 melanomas, established in syngeneic C 57 BL/ 6 mice, was assessed via an ex vivo cytokine vaccine approach or via an in vivo strategy utilizing combination cytokine/herpes simplex virus-thymidine kinase (HSV-tk) suicide gene delivery and treatment with ganciclovir (GCV). In the ex vivo tumor vaccine approach, B 16 melanoma cells, transduced in vitro by adenovirus containing either interleukin (IL) - 2, granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF), or tumor necrosis factor-α cytokine genes and γ irradiated, were subcutaneously injected into the flank and a distant subcutaneous challenge injection of unmodified B 16 melanoma cells was performed 15 d later. Significant reductions in challenge tumor volume were observed in the IL- 2 group (75 % reduction; p = 0. 02) and in the GM-CSF group (88 % reduction; p = 0. 0006), whereas the effect for tumor necrosis factor-α was not statistically significant. In the in vivo treatment of established melanomas, this cytokine approach was combined with a suicide gene therapy and subcutaneous B 16 melanomas were directly injected with (i) IL- 2 /recombinant, replication-deficient adenovirus (adv) and thymidine kinase (tk) /adv, (ii) GM-CSF/adv, IL- 2 /adv, and tk/adv, or (iii) control β-galactosidase (β-gal) /adv and tk/adv.

40|$|The {{study area}} {{is located in}} the transboundary River Douro basin (northern Portugal); it {{comprises}} the River Corgo fluvial network, which drains a meso-scale rural catchment with an area of 295 km 2, underlain by crystalline rocks, in a temperate climate. The results reported in this study derive from a geochemical survey of active fluvial sediments, with the aim of characterising the spatial and temporal distribution of the contents of As, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Pb, and Zn in a basin with mountainous features. To assess total contents of metals and their potential availability, as well as possible different origins of metals (natural vs. anthropogenic), a sequential chemical approach was used (modified BCR procedure). Multivariate data analysis (PCA) was used to assist the interpretation of datasets. The results show that, on the one hand, the metal contents distribute among all the geochemical phases studied. For the most relative labile fractions the reducible fraction is the most significant. The element-partitioning among geochemical phases indicates: (a) Co and Mn are transported in greater proportions in the most labile fraction, as exchangeable ions, as well as important proportions of Ni, Zn and Cu; (b) Cd and Pb associate preferentially with the hydroxides of Fe and Mn; (c) Cr and Cu are also transported by the organic phase; (<b>d)</b> <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> phase transport important proportions of Cr, Ni, Zn, Cu, Fe and Pb. The higher concentrations of Cu, Zn and, in particular, Pb, in the most labile fractions, which are higher where the total contents are also higher (and not concomitant with a correspondent increase in the residual fraction), suggest an important contribution of anthropogenic activities to the total contents of these elements in the sediments. Chromium and Ni are the main metals from a lithological source, with relatively higher contents in the residual fraction, and the lowest in the most mobile fractions. On the other hand, the spatial distribution pattern of metal contents in the mobile and semi-mobile fractions (available + reducible + oxidisable), shows that, in general, higher contents of metals in the most mobile fractions occur along the main courses of the major tributaries, in particular in the flatter reaches. The patterns of seasonal occurrence and distribution of metals show, in general, that the relative contents associated with the potentially available fraction increase during the period of low flow, which extends from April to September...|$|E

Here, we set all the weights to 1.0 in order that a residual value of 1.0 is assigned to a synthetic trace with “null” (zero) amplitude: that is, a residual larger than 1 (depicted with green lines in Fig.  4 c, d) indicates a synthetic worse than the “null trace.” For both events, <b>the</b> <b>residuals</b> for passbands shorter than 10  s are larger than 1, while those for passbands longer than 10  s are smaller than 1 : these values indicate that the synthetics with periods shorter than 10  s do not fit the corresponding observations, as described above. <b>The</b> <b>residual</b> of <b>the</b> 4 – 40  s passband also exceeds 1 for EV 2003, while it is (slightly) smaller than 1 for EV 2007, which shows that the synthetics with the 4 – 40  s passband fit the observations to some extent for the latter event.

40|$|Section 112 of the Clean Air Act (the Act) {{governs the}} {{regulation}} of hazardous air pollutants. From 1970 to 1990, the statute required the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate hazardous air pollutants on a pollutant-by-pollutant basis. Environmental policy analysts generally acknowledge that this approach failed due to scientific uncertainties and unclear direction from Congress on how the EPA should balance the competing concerns of cost and safety. In an effort to improve the Act 2 ̆ 7 s effectiveness, Congress passed the 1990 Amendments (the Amendments) to the Act, which established a two-phased approach to regulation. First, subsection 112 (<b>d)</b> requires <b>the</b> EPA to promulgate technology-based emission standards for categories and subcategories of industries that are major or area sources of 189 specified hazardous air pollutants. Because Congress was concerned that these controls would not eliminate all emissions posing unacceptable health risks to exposed populations, subsection 112 (f) then requires the EPA to determine for each category or subcategory of industries whether more stringent emission standards should be promulgated to control <b>residual</b> risks. Given <b>the</b> previously slow pace of regulation, Congress was probably right to emphasize speed and scope, rather than stringency and health, in requiring the EPA to promulgate national, uniform technology-based regulations for categories and subcategories of industries. <b>The</b> <b>residual</b> risk provisions in subsection 112 (f), however, provide only vague guidelines for the EPA to follow in establishing health-based standards after the technologybased approach is in place. In fact, <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> risk provisions adopt essentially the same approach to health-based regulation that failed in the pre- 1990 version of the statute. Subsection 112 (f) requires the EPA to examine the cancer risk of individual facilities in determining whether the agency must promulgate residual risk standards, but then requires the agency to issue such standards for a category or subcategory of industry rather than for the individual facilities. This Article proposes establishing an 2 ̆ 2 exceptions process 2 ̆ 2 to exempt individual facilities from both the categorical technologybased standards in subsection 112 (<b>d)</b> and <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> risk standards in subsection 112 (f). Under this approach, a firm could apply for a variance from either type of standard following a sitespecific risk assessment that demonstrates that (a) {{the costs of the}} standard are disproportionate to the benefits, and that (b) there is not an unacceptable risk to surrounding residents.

40|$|This paper investigates <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> {{compressive}} strength and ultrasonic pulse velocity (UPV) of concrete, {{which has been}} water-cured after exposure to high temperatures. The relationship between <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> strength ratio and <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> UPV ratio was developed. Cylindrical specimens were made of concrete with water-cement ratios of 0. 58 and 0. 68 and, after 90 days, the specimens were heated in an electric furnace to temperatures ranging from 400 to 1000 degrees C. The concrete specimens exposed to elevated temperatures were cured in a water tank for 72 h and tested after 4, 27, 87 and 177 days. The ultrasonic pulse velocity and {{compressive strength}} of each post-fire-curing specimen were measured. Experimental results show that water curing of the concrete specimens after exposure to high temperatures has noticeable effects on <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> strength and UPV recovery. It is also shown that {{a change in the}} mixture proportion of concrete does not {{have a significant effect on}} <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> strength ratio and <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> UPV ratio of concrete subjected to elevated temperatures. The relationship between <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> strength ratio and <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> UPV ratio was developed and a general equation is proposed for predicting <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> strength of post-fire-curing concrete. Finally, this paper verifies the validity of the proposed equation for predicting <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> strength ratios of post-fire-curing concrete with <b>the</b> measured <b>residual</b> UPV ratios.

The measurement results indicated that the annealing treatment significantly improved <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> stress distribution in the part, and <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> stresses were showed as compressive stress.

30|$|Monitoring {{the values}} of <b>the</b> <b>residuals</b> {{is one of the}} basic ways to measure the {{convergence}} of an iterative solution. This is because the errors in the solution of the system of equations are directly quantified by <b>the</b> <b>residuals.</b> <b>The</b> <b>residuals</b> determine <b>the</b> imbalances of the conserved variables in each control volume. Since in a numerical solution (using iterative method), <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> never gets to zero, a minimum value must be set. <b>The</b> smaller <b>the</b> <b>residual,</b> <b>the</b> more accurate the solution is numerically. The default setting of <b>the</b> <b>residuals</b> in ANSYS Fluent commercial code is 0.001. This value can, however, be reduced to obtain the desired degree of accuracy, however, in a very complicated problem analysis, attaining a very small residual can be challenging (Kuron 2015).|$|R
40|$|The paper {{proposes a}} new model of {{fractional}} cointegration, and considers methods for testing the existence of cointegrating relationships using the parametric bootstrap. In these procedures, ARFIMA time series models fitted to the data, with resampled residuals, are used to simulate the null hypothesis of non-cointegration. The simulations are used to determine p-values for alternative test statistics, including the F goodness-of-fit statistic, the Durbin-Watson, and estimates of <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> <b>d.</b> <b>The</b> tests are applied to the hypothesis that UK government support, shown in previous work to be a nonstationary fractional process, is not explained by indicators of economic performance. The power properties of the tests are studied by simulations of artificial cointegrating relationships based on the sample data. The tests based solely on <b>the</b> regression <b>residuals,</b> which are shown to be inconsistent for nonstationary alternatives, perform poorly relative to the test based on the F statistic. ...|$|R
40|$|The error {{associated}} with a numerical solution is intimately related with <b>the</b> <b>residual,</b> that is <b>the</b> lack of verification of the equation by the approximated solution. <b>The</b> <b>residual</b> is computable but obtaining the exact error from <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> is as difficult as computing <b>the</b> exact solution. <b>Residual</b> type estimators provide error assessment tools based on post processing <b>the</b> <b>residual.</b> This post process is either explicit (integrating <b>the</b> <b>residual)</b> or implicit (solving local problems with <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> as source term). Some of <b>the</b> <b>residual</b> type estimates are guaranteed error bounds. The standard estimators aim at assessing the energy norm of the error. Goaloriented assessment is carried out by considering an auxiliary problem {{associated with}} the selected quantity of interest (the adjoint or dual problem). Thus, an error representation allows estimating the error in the quantity of interest as a post-process of the energy measures of the errors in both the original problem and the adjoint one.
