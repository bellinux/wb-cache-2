50|$|The breakup {{process in}} a fluid thread or jet begins with the {{development}} of small perturbations on the free surface of the fluid. This is known as the linear theory of fluid thread breakup. These perturbations are always present and can be generated by numerous sources including vibrations of the <b>fluid</b> <b>container</b> or non-uniformity in the shear stress on the free surface. In general, these disturbances take an arbitrary form and are thus difficult to consider rigorously. It is therefore helpful to take a Fourier transform of the disturbances to decompose the arbitrary disturbances into perturbations of various single wavelengths {{on the surface of the}} thread. In doing so, this allows one to determine which wavelengths of the disturbance will grow and which will decay in time.|$|E

DESIGN: Prospective, randomized, controlled trial. SETTING: Eighteen-bed intensive care unit (ICU) in a large metropolitan hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Two hundred fifty-one patients with 404 chlorhexidine gluconate and silver sulfadiazine-coated multilumen CVCs. INTERVENTIONS: CVCs inserted in the ICU and in situ on day 4 were randomized to have their IV administration sets changed on day 4 (n = 203) or not at all (n = 201). Use of <b>fluid</b> <b>containers</b> and blood product administration sets was limited to 24 hours. CVCs were removed when not required, infection was suspected, or in place on day 7. Catheter cultures were performed on removal by blinded laboratory staff. Catheter-related bacteremia was diagnosed by a blinded intensivist using strict definitions.

To exemplify this point, we characterize a simple one-dimensional model consisting of a linear wave equation in an oscillating cavity with distinct injection and dissipation mechanisms.

40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{we present}} a micromachined flextensional droplet ejector array for use to eject liquids. By placing a fluid behind one face of a {{vibrating}} circular plate that has an orifice at its center, we achieve contiuuous and drop-on-demand ejection of the fluid. We present results of ejection of water and isopropanol. The ejector is harmless to sensitive fluids and can he used to eject fuels, organic polymers, photoresists, low-k dielectrics, adhesives, chemical and biological samples. Micromachined two-dimensional array flextensional droplet ejectors were realized using planar silicon micromachining techniques. Typical resonant frequency of the micromachined device ranges from 400 kHz to 4. 5 MHz. The ejections of water thru 4 pm diameter orifice at 3. 45 MHz and 10 pm diameter orifice at 2. 15 MHz were demonstrated by using the developed micromachined two-dimensional array ejectors.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} the linear surface wave instabilities of a shallow viscous fluid layer and the shape of the periodic, parametric-forcing function (describing the vertical acceleration of the <b>fluid</b> <b>container)</b> that excites them. We find numerically that the envelope of the resonance tongues can only develop multiple minima when the forcing function has more than two local extrema per cycle. With this insight, we construct a multi-frequency forcing function that generates at onset a non-trivial harmonic instability which is distinct from a subharmonic response to any of its frequency components. We measure the corresponding surface patterns experimentally and verify that small changes in the forcing waveform cause a transition, through a bicritical point, from the predicted harmonic short-wavelength pattern to a much larger standard subharmonic pattern. Using a formulation valid in the lubrication regime (thin viscous fluid layer) and a WKB method to find its analytic solutions, we explore the origin of the observed relation between the forcing function shape and the resonance tongue structure. In particular, we show that for square and triangular forcing functions the envelope of these tongues has only one minimum, as in the usual sinusoidal case. Comment: 12 pages, 10 figure...|$|E
