25|$|Nicklaus {{attended}} Ohio State from 1957 to 1961.

25|$|Sir Rowland {{wonders if}} there is {{anything}} written on the autographed papers in invisible ink and they test them, revealing the names of six distributors of drugs, including Costello. Going to tell the police their findings, the sleeping Pippa is left alone and, after a moment, Jeremy re-enters and is about to smother the girl's face with a cushion when Clarissa comes back. She soon realises that he is the killer. He was away from the other two men for a time after they had gone to the club to eat and a remark Pippa made about seeing <b>his</b> <b>golf</b> club ("A golf stick like Jeremy had", {{in the context of the}} weapon used to kill Costello) ties in. He also rang the police to try to incriminate Clarissa. Jeremy confesses; his motive was the envelope that the autographed papers were kept in ‚Äì on it is an extremely rare error stamp worth the fourteen thousand pounds. He is about to kill Clarissa when the police enter the room, having heard the exchange, and arrest him. They take him away. The others go to bed and Henry returns but without his diplomatic guests who have failed to turn up. Like the police inspector, he fails to believe a word his wife tells him of the evening's events...|$|E

5000|$|Although Barbaro was {{obviously}} talented at <b>golfing,</b> he put <b>his</b> family first and {{chose not to}} [...] "hit-the-road" [...] and tour too often, as he took his responsibilities as a husband and father more seriously than becoming [...] "renowned" [...] for <b>his</b> <b>golfing.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Starting out in golf {{by being}} a caddy, Penna {{was known for his}} {{personality}} and individualism as much as for <b>his</b> <b>golfing</b> abilities. [...] He was often a critic of <b>his</b> high-ranking <b>golf</b> contemporaries, and published a table illustrating his thoughts about {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each in his autobiography. With a ready temper but also a sense of humor, Penna's work as a golf pro brought him into contact with Dean Martin, Bing Crosby, and Bob Hope, among others.|$|R
25|$|Wallach and Eastwood flew to Madrid {{together}} and between shooting scenes, Eastwood would relax and practice <b>his</b> <b>golf</b> swing. Wallach was almost poisoned during filming when he accidentally drank {{from a bottle}} of acid that a film technician had set next to his soda bottle. Wallach mentioned this in his autobiography and complained that while Leone was a brilliant director, he was very lax about ensuring {{the safety of his}} actors during dangerous scenes. For instance, in one scene, where he was to be hanged after a pistol was fired, the horse underneath him was supposed to bolt. While the rope around Wallach's neck was severed, the horse was frightened a little too well. It galloped for about a mile with Wallach still mounted and his hands bound behind his back. The third time Wallach's life was threatened was during the scene where he and Mario Brega‚Äîwho are chained together‚Äîjump out of a moving train. The jumping part went as planned, but Wallach's life was endangered when his character attempts to sever the chain binding him to the (now dead) henchman. Tuco places the body on the railroad tracks, waiting for the train to roll over the chain and sever it. Wallach, and presumably the entire film crew, were not aware of the heavy iron steps that jutted one foot out of every box car. If Wallach had stood up from his prone position at the wrong time, one of the jutting steps could have decapitated him.|$|E

500|$|Haywood {{complained that}} John D. Rockefeller was [...] "wielding more power with <b>his</b> <b>golf</b> sticks than could {{the people of}} Colorado with their ballots." [...] It {{appeared}} to Haywood that the deck was stacked, and no enduring gains could be won for the workers short of changing {{the rules of the}} game. Increasingly, his industrial unionism took on a revolutionary flavor. In 1905 Haywood joined the more left-leaning socialists, labor anarchists in the Haymarket tradition, and other militant unionists to formulate the concept of revolutionary industrial unionism that animated the Industrial Workers of the World. Haywood called this philosophy [...] "socialism with its working clothes on." ...|$|E
50|$|Although Hay {{retired from}} broadcasting, he {{remained}} {{involved in the}} professional golf scene. He was noted for <b>his</b> <b>golfing</b> instruction, particularly the techniques of the swing. He wrote numerous works on the subject.
