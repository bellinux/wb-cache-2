40|$|The {{clinical}} {{effect of}} Melysin(R) on acute simple E. coli cystitis was evaluated in fifteen patients and {{compared with the}} result of the <b>disk</b> <b>test.</b> All of the patients showed a highly satisfactory response. In two, {{the result of the}} <b>disk</b> <b>test</b> with the 10 [9]/ml inoculation was non-sensitive to Melysin(R) while the others were sensitive. When the inoculum size was reduced to 10 [6]/ml the non-sensitive pathogen showed sensitivity. For evaluating the influence of inoculum size on the <b>disk</b> <b>test,</b> one hundred strains of clinically isolated E. coli were studied. Ninety-three strains were sensitive and only 4 strains were non-sensitive to Melysin(R) with inoculation of 10 [6]/ml. When the inoculum size was increased to 10 g/ml, 63 strains remained sensitive and the rest became non-sensitive, that is, the <b>disk</b> <b>test</b> was greatly influenced by inoculum size in thirty-three of the 100 strains. It has already been reported that the MIC of mecillinam to E. coli is influenced by the inoculums size. In the same way, the <b>disk</b> <b>test</b> of Melysin(R) against E. coli was also influenced by the inoculums size. This suggests that the clinical sensitivity test for Melysin(R) must be performed under the condition that an inoculum size of pathogen is 10 [6]/ml...|$|E

40|$|Background: MRSA {{phenotypic}} detection {{has been}} a problem since it was found in 1962. Some studies explain that the diffusion method of cefoxitin and oxacilin <b>disk</b> <b>test</b> can be used to detect MRSA. Objective: knowing if there is difference between cefoxitin <b>disk</b> <b>test</b> and oxacilin <b>disk</b> <b>test</b> to detect MRSA. Method: laboratory experimental research with diagnostic test design. Research was done at the laboratory of medicine faculty of UNISSULA using 24 watch glasses, 12 with MRSA bacteria (Meticillin Resisten Staphylococcus aureus), and the other 12 with MSSA bacteria (Meticillin sensitive Staphylococcus aureus). specimentsThe results were classified into sensitive and resistant category based on CLSI standard (Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute). Hypothesis test using fisher test, with significance level < 0, 05 Results: speciments MRSA detection using cefoxitin disk resulted 12 resistant speciments and no sensitive speciments. The oxacilin disk resulted 9 resistant speciments and 3 sensitive speciments. MSSA detection using cefoxitin disk resulted no resistant speciments and 12 sensitive speciments, oxacilin disk resulted no resistant speciments and 12 sensitive speciments. Diagnostic test was done by CEBM statistic calculator. The sensitivity and specificity value of MRSA sampels using cefoxitin disk were 96, 2 % & 96, 2 %, PPV (positive predictive value) 96, 2 %, NPV (negative predictive value) with was 96, 2 %. While the oxacilin disk, the sensitivity was 73, 1 %, specificity 96, 2 %, PPV 95, 0 %, NPV 73, 8 %. The result of fisher test for cefoxitin disk and oxacilin disk was p= 0. 000 meant there was difference between cefoxitin <b>disk</b> <b>test</b> and oxacilin <b>disk</b> <b>test</b> to detect MRSA. Conclusion: diffusion method in cefoxitin disk is better than oxacillin disk in MRSA detection...|$|E

40|$|Background: Detecting plasmid-mediated AmpC (pAmpC) β-lactamase-producing {{organism}} {{is important}} for optimal infection control and providing accurate and effective treatment option for physicians. Objectives: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the prevalence of pAmpC β-lactamase and compare the results of boronic acid (BA) <b>disk</b> <b>test</b> with other phenotypic tests detecting AmpC positive isolates. Materials and Methods: A total of 273 clinical isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae (n: 82) and Escherichia coli (n: 191) were analysed. The presence of pAmpC β-lactamase was determined by BA <b>disk</b> <b>test,</b> cefoxitin (FOX) screening test, modified three dimensional test (M 3 DT), and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was performed to evaluate the genetic similarities between isolates. To detect extended spectrum β-lactamases (ESBL) in the presence of AmpC β-lactamase, ESBL confirmation test was carried out with and without BA solution. Results: Of the 273 strains tested, 127 strains were found FOX resistant, 114 were positive by M 3 DT, 108 were positive in BA <b>disk</b> <b>test,</b> and the multiplex PCR detected 24 pAmpC β-lactamase-positive isolate. The prevalence of AmpC-producing strains was 10. 9 % in E. coli and 3. 6 % in K. pneumoniae in the tested population by PCR. CIT and MOX group genes were predominant type in these strains. Conclusion: These results emphasize that clinical laboratories should consider testing the presence of pAmpC enzymes particularly in FOX-resistant isolates, and BA <b>disk</b> <b>test</b> will improve detection of this emerging resistance phenotype...|$|E

40|$|The {{accuracy}} of <b>disk</b> susceptibility <b>tests</b> with ampicillin and ampicillin-sulbactam was not improved when {{the amount of}} ampicillin was increased from 10 to 20 or 30 micrograms per <b>disk.</b> For <b>testing</b> {{members of the family}} Enterobacteriaceae, ampicillin <b>disk</b> <b>tests</b> correlated better with broth microdilution tests when the zone size standards were altered from {{greater than or equal to}} 14 greater than or equal to 17 mm for susceptible and from less than or equal to 11 to less than or equal to 13 mm for resistant. The same zone size breakpoints apply to <b>tests</b> with ampicillin-sulbactam <b>disks</b> (10 / 10 micrograms). When Staphylococcus, Branhamella, and Haemophilus species are tested against ampicillin, interpretive breakpoints are those separating beta-lactamase-producing strains from nonproducing strains. However, when ampicillin-sulbactam is tested, beta-lactamase enzymes are efficiently inhibited by the sulbactam component, and thus zone size standards for ampicillin do not apply: zone size standards for the Enterobacteriaceae can be used for testing the combination against Staphylococcus, Branhamella, and Haemophilus species.

The intralaboratory reproducibility of the MIC test was excellent; 95. 7 % of the replicate tests (n = 220) were within 2 doubling dilutions of the other values in the set for the eight laboratories.

A total of 272 isolates were screened for ESBL and AmpC &#x 03 B 2;-lactamase by modified double disk approximation method (MDDM). Synergy observed between disks of ceftazidime/cefotaxime and clavulanate were considered as ESBL producer. Isolates showing reduced susceptibility to either of the test drugs (ceftazidime or cefotaxime) and cefoxitin were considered as presumptive AmpC producers and further confirmed by three-dimensional extraction method and AmpC <b>disk</b> <b>test.</b> A total of 173 (64 &#x 0025;) of the isolates were found to be ESBL positive and 61 (23 &#x 0025;) showed resistant to cefoxitin.
