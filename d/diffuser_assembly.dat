5000|$|The Diablo SV-R {{featured}} a stripped-down interior with a rollcage, racing seat, and removable steering wheel; the power glass side windows were replaced with fixed Plexiglass with traditional race-style sliding sections. On the exterior, the electric pop-up headlamps were replaced either with fixed units (similar to those which appeared {{later on the}} road cars in 1999) or with open ducting for the front brakes. A larger, deeper front spoiler was fitted, while the rear bumper was replaced with a <b>diffuser</b> <b>assembly</b> and the traditional Diablo [...] "wing" [...] was replaced with a true adjustable carbon fiber spoiler. Side skirts were added for aerodynamics, but this left so little ground clearance that pneumatic air jacks also had to be installed to raise the car for service in the pit lane; similar jacks {{can be seen in}} use on the more recent Ferrari F430 Challenge. [...] Lightweight, hollow center-lock OZ wheels were used, although these were later switched to stronger Speedline units. Linear-rate springs were used with Koni shock absorbers and were adjusted to about twice the stiffness of stock Diablo SV suspension.With all modifications, the SV-R weighed 1385 kg, 191 kg less than the factory SV.|$|E
40|$|A {{containment}} {{and waste}} package system for processing and shipping tritium oxide waste received from a process gas includes an outer drum and an inner drum containing a disposable {{molecular sieve bed}} (DMSB) seated within outer drum. The DMSB includes an inlet <b>diffuser</b> <b>assembly,</b> an outlet <b>diffuser</b> <b>assembly,</b> and a hydrogen catalytic recombiner. The DMSB adsorbs tritium oxide from the process gas and converts it to a solid form so that the tritium is contained during shipment to a disposal site. The DMSB is filled with type 4 A molecular sieve pellets capable of adsorbing up to 1000 curies of tritium. The recombiner contains a sufficient amount of catalyst to cause any hydrogen and oxygen present in the process gas to recombine to form water vapor, which is then adsorbed onto the DMSB...|$|E

40|$|This thesis details a {{study of}} {{strategies}} used to limit the flow generated noise encountered in the outlet diffusers of high velocity heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) duct systems. The underlying noise rating criterion is drawn from the specifications covering ocean going aluminium fast ferries. Although directed primarily towards the fast ferry industry the results presented herein are applicable to other niche high velocity HVAC applications. Experimental tests have been conducted to prove the viability of a high velocity HVAC duct system in meeting airflow requirements whilst maintaining acceptable passenger cabin noise levels. A 50 mm diameter circular jet of air was expanded using a primary conical diffuser {{with a variety of}} secondary outlet configurations. Noise measurements were taken across a velocity range of 15 to 60 m/s. An optimum outlet design has been experimentally identified by varying the diffuser angle, outlet duct length and the termination grill. A 4 to 5 fold reduction in required duct area was achieved {{with the use of a}} distribution velocity of 20 to 30 ms- 1, without exceeding the prescribed passenger cabin noise criteria. The geometric configuration of the <b>diffuser</b> outlet <b>assembly</b> was found to have a pronounced effect on the noise spectrum radiating from the duct outlet. The development of a numerical model capable of predicting the flow induced noise generated by airflow exiting a ventilation duct is also documented. The model employs a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) CFD model to calculate the turbulent flow field through the duct diffuser section and outlet. The flow-generated noise is then calculated using a far field acoustic postprocessor based on the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings integral based formulation of Lighthill&# 146;s acoustic analogy. Time varying flow field variables are used to calculate the fluctuating noise sources located at the duct outlet and the resulting far field sound pressure levels. This result is then used to calculate the corresponding far field sound intensity and sound power levels. The numerical acoustic model has been verified and validated against the measured experimental results for multiple outlet diffuser configurations...|$|R
40|$|A <b>diffuser</b> <b>assembly</b> is {{provided}} for narrow groove welding using an automatic {{gas tungsten arc welding}} torch. The <b>diffuser</b> <b>assembly</b> includes manifold adapted for adjustable mounting on the welding torch which is received {{in a central}} opening in the manifold. Laterally extending manifold sections communicate with a shield gas inlet such that shield gas supplied to the inlet passes to gas passages of the manifold sections. First and second tapered diffusers are respectively connected to the manifold sections in fluid communication with the gas passages thereof. The diffusers extend downwardly along the torch electrode on opposite sides thereof so as to release shield gas {{along the length of the}} electrode and at the distal tip of the electrode. The diffusers are of a transverse width which is on the order of the thickness of the electrode so that the diffusers can, in use, be inserted into a narrow welding groove before and after the electrode in the direction of the weld operation...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to compare the effects of two different diffuser vane geometries on the performance of a centrifugal compressor. Vaned diffusers are commonly used in aeroengines because they can achieve higher pressure recoveries than vaneless diffusers of similar size. Improving the diffuser’s pressure recovery and effectiveness can result in overall compressor performance benefits that are sought out by engine manufacturers looking to improve overall engine efficiency. An airfoil vane was tested and compared to a baseline wedge diffuser in the Purdue CSTAR research facility, where the centrifugal compressor used for this study is intended to be the last stage of an axial-centrifugal compressor. ^ The overall stage performance for the compressor with the airfoil diffuser was first obtained at open impeller tip clearances and then at tight clearances. In the tight clearance configuration, the compressor consistently had higher total pressure ratio and higher isentropic efficiency compared to the open clearance configuration. In particular, impeller isentropic efficiency and shroud static pressure along the entire impeller passage were highest at the tight impeller clearance configuration, indicating less losses due to tip leakage flow. The reduction in tip leakage flow, and resulting blockage, at tight clearance operation was also suggested by the increase in choke mass flow rate for all corrected speeds. ^ For the comparison of the airfoil and wedge diffuser assemblies, data were acquired with the impeller in the tight clearance configuration. Despite slight differences in exducer tip clearances (less than 2 x 10 - 3 in.), stage total pressure ratio and isentropic efficiency at 100 % corrected speed were not significantly different between the two diffuser assemblies. Upon closer inspection of individual components, the airfoil diffuser actually had, on average, higher pressure recovery and higher diffuser effectiveness than the wedge diffuser. However, the airfoil <b>diffuser</b> <b>assembly</b> had higher losses in the deswirl region compared to the wedge <b>diffuser</b> <b>assembly.</b> Excluding measurements from the deswirl, the total pressure ratio for the airfoil <b>diffuser</b> <b>assembly</b> was slightly greater than that of the wedge <b>diffuser</b> <b>assembly.</b> A physical mismatch in the airfoil diffuser and deswirl assembly could be responsible for the losses recorded in the deswirl region and could have resulted in the limited performance improvements observed. Additionally, the similar vane geometries at the leading edge (in terms of inlet metal angle and thickness) combined with any deviation from design during manufacturing could have limited the predicted performance benefits. ...|$|E
40|$|Different inlet {{designs for}} high {{angle of attack}} STOL and VTOL {{applications}} were tested in a subsonic wind tunnel. Three removable entry lips having contraction ratios of 1. 30, 1. 34 and 1. 38 were tested with a single diffuser. The internal contour of each entry lip was an ellipse with a major to minor axis of 2. 0. Each lip and <b>diffuser</b> <b>assembly</b> was tested to determine its tolerance to angle of attack, first with a conventional centerbody and then with an extended centerbody. Results indicate that a large improvement in separation angle (determined {{as a function of}} lip contraction ratio and inlet flow) was obtained for the extended centerbody for all contraction ratios. Improved inlet tolerance to angle of attack was obtained by reducing the adverse pressure gradient downstream of the throat...|$|E

VIIRS collects radiometric and imagery data of the Earth’s atmosphere, oceans, and land surfaces in 22 spectral bands spanning the visible and infrared spectrum from 0. 4 to 12. 5 mm. Radiometric calibration of the reflective bands in the 0. 4 to 2. 5 mm wavelength range (M 1 – M 11, I 1 – I 3) range is performed by measuring the sunlight reflectance from Solar <b>Diffuser</b> <b>assembly</b> (diffuser is Spectralon™). The reflected sun light is directly proportional to the Bidirectional Reflectance Distribution Function (BRDF) of the Spectralon™. This paper presents the BRDF measurements of the Spectralon™ for JPSS in the 0. 4 – 0. 9 mm wavelength using PASCAL (Polarization And Scatter Characterization Analysis of Lambertian materials) with an uncertainty better than 1. 2 %. PASCAL makes absolute measurements of BRDF in an analogous fashion National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Spectral Tri-function Automated Reflectance Reflectometer (STARR) facility. The entire incident light beam is collected by the detector assembly. With the sample in place, a precision circular aperture with a viewing region larger than the illuminated spot is used to collect the light. BRDF is calculated {{on the basis of the}} incident power and geometric factors eliminating the need for a standard characterized at another laboratory. Spectral definition is achieved with band pass filters. As in typical BRDF instruments, the detector rotates about the sample in the plane defined by the source beam and the azimuth rotation of the sample. Unique additional features of this instrument include the ability to vary the sample elevation and roll / clock the sample about its normal. PASCAL is set up to mount the flight Solar <b>Diffuser</b> <b>assembly</b> (Spectralon™ is 23. 7 X 28. 6 cm). The ability to change elevation and roll the sample about the surface normal enables measuring the BRDF in the as use configuration of VIIRS including source, Solar Diffuser, and detector geometry.

Spectralon™ is known to solarize due to sun UV exposure at the blue end of the spectrum (~ 0. 4 – 0. 6 + mm) as seen by laboratory tests as well as on orbit data from MODIS. VIIRS uses a SDSM (Solar Diffuser Stability Monitor) to monitor the change in the Solar Diffuser reflectance in the 0. 4 – 0. 94 mm wavelength range and provide a correction to the calibration constants. The SDSM measures the ratio of sun light reflecting from the Solar Diffuser to a direct view of the sun. The intensity of the light reaching the SDSM in both Solar Diffuser view and sun view {{is a function of the}} sun’s angle of incidence. The error in the Solar Diffuser to sun view in the SDSM ratio due to response due to sun angle of incidence translates into an error in the Solar Diffuser reflectance correction. Thus the SDSM response variation with sun angle of incidence has to be characterized. The sun angle of incidence of variation for the Solar Diffuser view is measured by measuring the BRDF of the Solar Diffuser as a function of angle of incidence. This paper presents the test equipment developed and the results for the complete SDSM relative response to sun angle of incidence in sun view for Flight J 1 for JPSS. The relative response to the sun angle of incidence was performed with an uncertainty better than 0. 5 %. The test required developing a source to simulate the sun including parameters such as a 0. 5 ° extended collimated source with sufficient intensity for adequate signal to noise on the SDSM detectors. The source also needed to have adequate stability to characterize the angular response with acceptable repeatability. Details of the equipment as well as typical results for Flight J 1 for JPSS will be presented...|$|E
