25|$|According to Corner, Kinichi, and Keats, {{strategic}} {{decision making in}} organizations occurs at two levels: individual and aggregate. They developed a model of parallel {{strategic decision}} making. The model identifies two parallel processes that involve getting attention, encoding <b>information,</b> <b>storage</b> and retrieval of information, strategic choice, strategic outcome and feedback. The individual and organizational processes interact at each stage. For instance, competition-oriented objectives {{are based on the}} knowledge of competing firms, such as their market share.|$|E
25|$|The viral eukaryogenesis (VE) theory {{proposes that}} {{eukaryotic}} cells arose {{from a combination}} of a lysogenic virus, an archaeon and a bacterium. This model suggests that the nucleus originated when the lysogenic virus incorporated genetic material from the archaeon and the bacterium and took over the role of <b>information</b> <b>storage</b> for the amalgam. The archaeal host transferred much of its functional genome to the virus during the evolution of cytoplasm but retained the function of gene translation and general metabolism. The bacterium transferred most of its functional genome to the virus as it transitioned into a mitochondrion.|$|E

25|$|Therefore, a possibility, first {{suggested}} by Francis Crick, {{is that the}} first life was based on RNA, which has the DNA-like properties of <b>information</b> <b>storage</b> and the catalytic properties of some proteins. This is called the RNA world hypothesis, and it is supported by the observation that many of the most critical components of cells (those that evolve the slowest) are composed mostly or entirely of RNA. Also, many critical cofactors (ATP, Acetyl-CoA, NADH, etc.) are either nucleotides or substances clearly related to them. The catalytic properties of RNA had not yet been demonstrated when the hypothesis was first proposed, but they were confirmed by Thomas Cech in 1986.|$|E
25|$|While DNA is most {{important}} for <b>information</b> <b>storage,</b> a large fraction of the cell's activities are carried out by proteins. Therefore, {{it is important to}} have tools to send proteins to specific regions of the cell and to link different proteins together, as desired. Ideally the interaction strength between protein partners should be tunable between a lifetime of seconds (desirable for dynamic signaling events) up to an irreversible interaction (desirable when building devices stable over days or resilient to harsh conditions). Interactions such as coiled coils, SH3 domain-peptide binding or SpyTag/SpyCatcher have helped to give such control. In addition it is important to be able to regulate protein-protein interactions in cells, such as with light (using Light-oxygen-voltage-sensing domains) or cell-permeable small molecules by Chemically induced dimerization.|$|E
25|$|The lipid world theory postulates {{that the}} first {{self-replicating}} object was lipid-like. It is known that phospholipids form lipid bilayers in water while under agitation—the same structure as in cell membranes. These molecules were not present on early Earth, but other amphiphilic long-chain molecules also form membranes. Furthermore, these bodies may expand (by insertion of additional lipids), and under excessive expansion may undergo spontaneous splitting which preserves {{the same size and}} composition of lipids in the two progenies. The main idea in this theory is that the molecular composition of the lipid bodies is the preliminary way for <b>information</b> <b>storage,</b> and evolution led to the appearance of polymer entities such as RNA or DNA that may store information favourably. Studies on vesicles from potentially prebiotic amphiphiles have so far been limited to systems containing one or two types of amphiphiles. This in contrast to the output of simulated prebiotic chemical reactions, which typically produce very heterogeneous mixtures of compounds.|$|E

25|$|VSTM {{is thought}} to be the visual {{component}} of the working memory system, and as such it is used as a buffer for temporary <b>information</b> <b>storage</b> during the process of naturally occurring tasks. But what naturally occurring tasks actually require VSTM? Most work on this issue has focused on the role of VSTM in bridging the sensory gaps caused by saccadic eye movements. These sudden shift of gaze typically occur 2–4 times per second, and vision is briefly suppressed while the eyes are moving. Thus, the visual input consists of a series of spatially shifted snapshots of the overall scene, separated by brief gaps. Over time, a rich and detailed long-term memory representation is constructed from these brief glimpses of the input, and VSTM {{is thought to}} bridge the gaps between these glimpses and to allow the relevant portions of one glimpse to be aligned with the relevant portions of the next glimpse. Both spatial and object VSTM systems may play important roles in the integration of information across eye movements.|$|E
25|$|With the 1950s came {{increasing}} {{awareness of}} the potential of automatic devices for literature searching and <b>information</b> <b>storage</b> and retrieval. As these concepts grew in magnitude and potential, so did the variety of information science interests. By the 1960s and 70s, there was a move from batch processing to online modes, from mainframe to mini and microcomputers. Additionally, traditional boundaries among disciplines began to fade and many information science scholars joined with library programs. They further made themselves multidisciplinary by incorporating disciplines in the sciences, humanities and social sciences, {{as well as other}} professional programs, such as law and medicine in their curriculum. By the 1980s, large databases, such as Grateful Med at the National Library of Medicine, and user-oriented services such as Dialog and Compuserve, were for the first time accessible by individuals from their personal computers. The 1980s also saw the emergence of numerous special interest groups to respond to the changes. By the end of the decade, special interest groups were available involving non-print media, social sciences, energy and the environment, and community information systems. Today, information science largely examines technical bases, social consequences, and theoretical understanding of online databases, widespread use of databases in government, industry, and education, and the development of the Internet and World Wide Web.|$|E
