40|$|Traditional basal-bolus and {{closed-loop}} {{artificial pancreas}} therapy for {{type 1 diabetes}} mellitus were studied in the present work and novel insulin <b>delivery</b> <b>profiles</b> have been identified. Type 1 diabetes is a chronic condition resulting from autoimmune destruction of the pancreatic insulin producing β-cells. Inadequate insulin secretion prevents efficient glucose metabolism and is a serious health risk. Major available treatment modes are multiple daily injections of insulin and insulin pump therapy providing continuous subcutaneous infusion. General insulin regimens for low- and high-fat meals were studied in silico to improve current pump therapy for type 1 diabetes. This involved modifications of the FDA-accepted UVA/Padova metabolic simulation model for evaluations of meals with different absorption rates. Simulations of meals with varied fat content under this modified model demonstrated qualitative replications of published data. Subsequently, an insulin regimen library with optimized regimens under open- and closed-loop settings {{for a variety of}} meal compositions was constructed using the particle swarm optimization algorithm.

To overcome the skin 2 ̆ 7 s barriers we have developed a novel cutaneous delivery method using high aspect ratio elongate microparticles (EMPs).

A rotary smoking machine with a twin filter interface was used to smoke cigarettes with varying menthol and “tar” deliveries determined based on the Cambridge filter method.

40|$|A {{significant}} number of recently developed drugs are based on naturally occurring compounds, such as proteins, peptides, and carbohydrates. Often, these pharmaceuticals, generally referred to as biologicals or macromolecules, cannot be delivered by traditional methods of drug delivery. In many cases, the precise volume of delivery, location of delivery, and <b>delivery</b> <b>profile</b> are important factors in {{the effectiveness of the}} therapeutic. Adequate, widespread mechanisms for delivery of biologicals do not currently exist, and the ultimate utility of these new pharmaceuticals depends on the creation of new processes and devices to deliver the drugs. This thesis gives a detailed overview of a novel microneedle drug delivery device that is designed to deliver small volumes of biologicals to a known depth below the stratum corneum. The stainless steel microneedles are in the range of 100 - 175 Itm OD and 25 - 100 pim ID, and minimize the pain often associated with delivery by injection.

Other ways to enhance perception were explored as a means to reduce sodium, by building further on the generic principle of receptors as contrast detectors. The increase of saltiness perception was investigated via controlled delivery of ‘high-in-salt pulses’ into the mouth of assessors using a gustometer.

40|$|A {{new type}} of {{hydrogel}} was prepared, under controlled conditions, by diffusion of Ca(II) ions into a solution of the carboxylated derivative of Scleroglucan (Sclerox). The obtained hydrogel was loaded with Theophylline (TPH) and Myoglobin (MGB), two model drugs of remarkably different steric hindrance, and also used, after freeze drying, for the preparation of tablets. Release {{studies were carried out}} on both the freshly prepared gel and on the tablets. As far as the gel systems experiments are concerned, the <b>delivery</b> <b>profiles</b> resulted to be deeply dependent on the molecular dimensions of the loaded molecules; TPH was easily released while the larger tested molecule (MGB) remained partially entrapped within the three-dimensional network. Furthermore, in the case of MGB, the release was dependent also on polymer concentration (c(p)) : at the highest investigated cp value a corresponding lowest delivery of the guest molecule was observed. This effect of polymer concentration on the rate of delivery was studied applying three different mathematical approaches: the one that better fitted the experimental release profile allowed to support the explanation of the mechanism involved in the observed two-step delivery that has been related to the drug trapping inside the clusters of the gel network. The <b>delivery</b> <b>profiles</b> from the tablets showed how the release, in this case, could be related, essentially, to the molecular dimensions of the guest molecules, independently on the cp used to prepare the starting hydrogel. TPH was completely delivered in a few hours while the MGB was almost unable to diffuse out of the matrix and more than 80 % resulted entrapped in the network for at least 24 h. The novel hydrogel, at different c(p), was also characterized by means of a texture analyzer to inspect its mechanical properties. According to the compression data, the hardness, the work of cohesion and the work of adhesion of the networks were estimated. Furthermore, by means of relaxation experiments, analysed applying the generalized Maxwell model, the gels can be classified as solid viscoelastic materials and the mechanical spectra indicated a predominance of the viscous behaviour, while the Young modulus, E- 0, as expected, was found to increase with polymer concentration.

40|$|This is a {{study of}} drug {{delivery}} problems from hydrogels and it is mainly focused {{on the effects of}} the hydrogel's geometry on the behaviour of the release <b>profile.</b> Studying drug <b>delivery</b> also offers one the opportunity to delve into the physical mechanisms involved in the release process to better understand its theoretical implications. We can apply the well-developed theory of diffusion in order to understand many aspects of drug delivery. Thus, this thesis starts with a presentation of concepts and theories used in the following two articles (chapters). We go over the basic concept of drug delivery, followed by an introduction on diffusion. We then explain the ideas governing drug release and how we have modeled it. The tools used to generate our drug release platforms are presented followed by a discussion on characterizing the resulting drug release profiles. This thesis is presented as a series of two articles that have been submitted to peer-reviewed scientific journals. The first article presents a novel combinatorial technique used to obtain controlled drug <b>delivery</b> <b>profiles.</b> We use an exact enumeration diffusion model in order to obtain our drug release profiles and test its validity by comparing these results with analytical theory and widely used empirical tools. By using a genetic algorithm, we then show {{that it is possible to}} tailor the drug delivery platform in order to get a specific functional form of the release profile. The second article consists in testing two widely used empirical functions that are used in the literature to characterize drug release profiles. Several claims have been made regarding the interpretation of these functions and we have used our exact enumeration data to argue that although the functions fit the data relatively well on certain time scales, they do not necessarily convey reliable information about the mechanism of release. Finally, we conclude with preliminary work that was done on a second optimization technique to be used in controlling drug <b>delivery</b> <b>profiles.</b> The Metropolis simulated annealing was used to further optimize the design of the drug release platform and was shown to be quite effective, albeit being computationally demanding...|$|R
