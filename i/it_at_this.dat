5|$|Following the {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia by the Axis powers and their creation of the Independent State of Croatia, Stojanović was arrested {{at the behest of}} the Ustaše, Croatia's fascist ruling party. He escaped prison and went to Kozara, where he joined fellow communists that had escaped from Prijedor. The KPJ chose Stojanović to lead the communist uprising in Prijedor. The uprising began on 30July 1941, although neither Stojanović nor any of the other communists had much control over <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> stage. The Serb villagers of the district seized control of a number of villages and threatened Prijedor, which was defended by the Germans, Ustaše, and Croatian Home Guards. In August 1941, Stojanović was recognised as the principal leader of the Kozara insurgents, who were then organised into Partisan military units. Under Stojanović's direction, the Kozara Partisans began attacking the fascists from the end of September 1941. In early November 1941, all Partisan units in Kozara were merged into the 2nd Krajina National Liberation Partisan Detachment, commanded by Stojanović. By the end of the year, most of Kozaracovering about was controlled by Stojanović's detachment.|$|E
25|$|It {{was perhaps}} to emphasise the new civic {{serenity}} of Subotica that the pious name Saint Mary {{came to be}} used for <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> time. Some decades later, in 1779, Empress Maria Theresa of Austria advanced the town's status further by proclaiming it a Free Royal Town. The enthusiastic inhabitants of the city renamed Subotica once more as Maria-Theresiopolis.|$|E

25|$|Divine Liturgy of the Last Supper is held on {{the morning}} of Great and Holy Thursday, {{combining}} Vespers with the Liturgy of Saint Basil the Great. There is a custom among some churches to place a simple white linen cloth over the Holy Table (altar) for this Liturgy, reminiscent of the Last Supper. In cathedrals and monasteries it is customary for the bishop or hegumen (abbot) to celebrate the Washing of Feet. When it is necessary for an autocephalous church to consecrate more chrysm the primate of that church will consecrate <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> Liturgy.|$|E
25|$|He {{would run}} towards {{the corner and}} then swiftly turn inwards, running {{parallel}} to the back line, and some ten yards from <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> point he was pursued probably by three of the opponents, barely keeping up. This continued till he got opposite the further goal post, and then one huge foot was smartly dropped on the ball, stopping it dead, {{and of course the}} pursuers all ran a yard or so too far, not suspecting the sudden pull up; thus he had a clear shot at the goal.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} for schizophrenia to develop at any age, but it mostly happens to people within the ages of 16–30 (generally males 16–25 and females 25–30) - about 75 percent of people living with the illness develop <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> age. There is a likelihood of children developing schizophrenia, though it is quite rare {{before the age of}} 12. Also, new cases are uncommon after age 40. In addition, about 1 percent of the world's population will develop schizophrenia over their lifetime, therefore out of all the people born, one in 100 will develop schizophrenia by age 55. There is on average a somewhat earlier onset for men than women, with the possible influence of the female hormone estrogen being one hypothesis and sociocultural influences another.|$|E

25|$|The Second World War {{meant that}} Tracey had a {{disrupted}} formal education, {{and he became}} a professional musician {{at the age of}} sixteen as a member of an ENSA touring group playing the accordion, his first instrument. He joined Ralph Reader's Gang Shows at the age of nineteen, while in the RAF and formed a brief acquaintance with the comedian Tony Hancock. Later, in the early 1950s, he worked in groups on the transatlantic liners Queen Mary and Caronia and toured the UK in 1951 with Cab Calloway. By the mid-1950s, he had also taken up the vibraphone, but later ceased playing <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> time he worked widely with leading British modernists, including drummer Tony Crombie, clarinettist Vic Ash, the saxophonist-arranger Kenny Graham and trumpeter Dizzy Reece.|$|E
25|$|At one point, local commanders {{decided to}} remove the coastal {{artillery}} from the badly damaged fortress, and the 33rd was asked to help. The guns were removed from their five- to eight-inch bases during daylight hours; later, at night, they were slung beneath a specially built wagon equipped with fourteen-inch-wide tires, to which thirty-six mules were hitched. A lengthy rope was tied to the tongue, and 100 soldiers were tasked with pulling on it to help these mules haul the cannon across the sandy beach to barges on the bay, which in turn carried them on to Pensacola. The guns were replaced with wood planks shaped and painted to resemble artillery, to deceive the Federals into thinking the fortor {{what was left of}} <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> pointwas still a threat.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, by mid-afternoon, {{the rear}} of the column—believing the day's march to be nearly at an end—was dawdling. This {{resulted}} in the army becoming separated, with some having already crossed the summit and others still approaching <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> point the Turks, who had been following and feinting for many days, seized their opportunity and attacked those who had not yet crossed the summit. The French, both soldiers and pilgrims, taken by surprise, were trapped. Those who tried to escape were caught and killed. Many men, horses, and much of the baggage were cast into the canyon below. The chronicler William of Tyre, writing between 1170 and 1184 and thus perhaps too long after the event to be considered historically accurate, placed the blame for this disaster firmly on the amount of baggage being carried, much of it reputedly belonging to Eleanor and her ladies, and the presence of non-combatants.|$|E

25|$|Stephen and Stirling {{moved their}} {{divisions}} without incident, {{even though their}} troops were coming under fire from the enemy's light troops. De Borre somehow mismanaged the shift of Sullivan's division. Instead of simply moving to the right, the Frenchman ordered the division to file {{off to the left}} and circle back to the northeast. At the end of the bizarre maneuver, the 1st Brigade was in almost the same position it started. Instead of being alongside the 1st Brigade, the 2nd Brigade was behind <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> moment, the crack Brigade of Guards supported by two 12-pound cannons attacked. When the sound of gunfire erupted, the confused soldiers of the 2nd Brigade volleyed into the backs of the 1st Brigade. The 1st Maryland Regiment put up some resistance, suffering 26 casualties, but the entire division soon crumbled. The soldiers headed to the rear pursued by the British Guards. De Borre later stated to Samuel Smith of the 4th Maryland that a wound on his cheek was caused by the English firing fish hooks. Smith suspected that de Borre misrepresented his injury and that it was caused by riding through some briars. Since it led the column of march, Hazen's regiment apparently did not take part in de Borre's maneuver and instead joined Stirling's left flank.|$|E
25|$|After an {{interlude}} by Mr. Hudson, furious {{about the}} need to re-shoot the first scene, the scene continues from where it left off. The rally car speeds up continuing the donuts that ended the first scene before speeding to the far left corner of the arena where a police car suddenly appears. The rally car brakes with just centimetres to spare. It then reverses half the width of the arena before performing a reverse-180 turn and driving towards the second police car at the far right of the arena. The rally car then speeds up to the left end of the arena with the second police car following <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> point the rally car drifts the corner before returning to the right side performing a 180 skid to park the car perpendicular with the right wall. The two police cars follow performing the same manoeuvre resulting in the three cars being in parallel with each other. The rally car first races off the arena through the centre exit. The police cars then meet in the middle and perform donuts, with the nose of each car nearly touching the next, before following the exit of the rally car. At this point the motorcyclist makes his return by shooting a third police car with his gun, which causes it to split in half.|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} Monaco was first prototyped when Andy Schatz {{was working for}} TKO Software, a video game {{development}} company based in Santa Cruz, California. The game was originally inspired by the top-down minimap in the Hitman series and was described by Schatz as being similar to Jason Rohrer's 2014 video game The Castle Doctrine during its early stages of development. His original plans were to release Monaco as an Xbox Live Indie Games title, made within six weeks. He {{said that when he}} was talking to people about <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>this</b> stage, he described it as [...] "The Sims meets Diablo meets Hitman". The development at TKO was done in three weeks while the company solicited paying work. Before TKO shut down in 2005, Schatz left and founded his own independent company, Pocketwatch Games. After Pocketwatch Games experimented with simulation games, such as 2006 Independent Games Festival finalist [...] and Wildlife Tycoon: Venture Dinosauria, Schatz prototyped an early version of Monaco using Microsoft XNA as to see if it worked on the Xbox 360.|$|E

500|$|A {{small company}} of Hessian dragoons led by Captain Johann Ewald {{headed up the}} road from the tavern toward Cooch's Bridge as Cornwallis's advance guard. [...] These were struck by a volley of fire from an American ambush and many of them fell, either killed or wounded. [...] Ewald {{remained}} unwounded, and quickly alerted the Hessian and Ansbach Jäger, who rushed forward to meet the Americans. [...] This began a running skirmish that Major John André described as follows: [...] "Here the rebels began to attack us about 9o'clock with a continued irregular fire for nearly two miles." [...] Howe rode to the front lines, and seeing Iron Hill crawling with enemy soldiers, ordered his troops to clear <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>this</b> time, much of Maxwell's force was defending Iron Hill, while the rest were protecting Cooch's Bridge. The Jäger, numbering over 400men led by Lieutenant Colonel Ludwig von Wurmb, formed a line and, with the support of some artillery, advanced on the Americans. [...] Von Wurmb sent one detachment to Maxwell's left, hoping to flank his position, and supported the move with a bayonet charge against the American center.|$|E
