5|$|Control over {{propaganda}} <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter.</b> When forming {{his argument}} here, Russell specifically targets the doctrines of John Stuart Mill. Russell argues that Mill's {{argument for the}} freedom of speech is too weak, so long as it is balanced against the harm principle; for any speech worth protecting for political reasons is likely to cause somebody harm. For example, the citizen ought {{to have the opportunity to}} impeach malicious governors, but that would surely harm the governor, at the very least (Russell 1938:179).|$|E
5|$|The basic {{ingredients}} for lifewhat we call 'pre-biotic chemistry'are abundant in many solar system objects, such as comets, asteroids and icy moons. Biologists believe liquid {{water and energy}} are then needed to actually support life, so it's exciting to find another place where we might have liquid water. But, energy <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter,</b> and currently, Callisto's ocean is only being heated by radioactive elements, whereas Europa has tidal energy as well, from its greater proximity to Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Some critics, {{among them}} Tchaikovsky biographers Lawrence and Elisabeth Hanson, have {{wondered}} {{what would have}} happened if Tchaikovsky had joined Balakirev in 1862 instead of attending the Conservatory. They suggest that he might have developed much more quickly as an independent composer, and offer as proof the fact that Tchaikovsky did not write his first wholly distinct work until Balakirev goaded and inspired him to write Romeo. How well Tchaikovsky might have developed in the long run <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter.</b> He owed much of his musical ability, including his skill at orchestration, to the thorough grounding in counterpoint, harmony and musical theory he received at the Conservatory. Without that grounding, Tchaikovsky might not have been able to write what would become his greatest works.|$|E

Recreational divers are expected {{not to do}} decompression dives by most certification organizations, though CMAS and BSAC allow for short decompression dives in some levels of recreational divers. Technical, commercial, military and scientific divers may all be expected to do decompression dives in {{the normal course of}} their sport or occupation, and are specifically trained in appropriate procedures and equipment relevant to their level of certification. A significant part of practical and theoretical training for these divers is on the {{practice of}} safe and effective decompression procedures and the selection and use of the appropriate equipment.|$|E

25|$|Redshift can be {{measured}} by determining the wavelength of a known transition, such as hydrogen α-lines for distant quasars, and finding the fractional shift compared to a stationary reference. Thus redshift is a quantity unambiguous for experimental observation.

25|$|Player safety <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter</b> altogether. In December 2010, Little League Baseball {{announced}} {{a moratorium on}} the use of composite bats due to concerns about safety of young players. The increased batted ball speed from bats designed with composite materials introduced increased risk to fielders and especially to the pitcher. Since then, however, Little League Baseball allows certain composite bats that are stamped with the BPF 1.15 rating. This 1.15 rating, like the BBCOR standards, keeps the trampoline effect under what Little League Baseball considers a safe level.|$|E

25|$|The Reverend John Wilson and the {{minister}} of Hester's church, Arthur Dimmesdale, question the woman, but she refuses to name her lover. After she returns to her prison cell, the jailer brings in Roger Chillingworth, a physician, to calm Hester and her child with his roots and herbs. He and Hester have an open conversation regarding their marriage {{and the fact that}} they were both in the wrong. Her lover, however, <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter</b> and he demands to know who it is; Hester refuses to divulge such information. He accepts this, stating that he will find out anyway, and forces her to hide that he is her husband. If she ever reveals him, he warns her, he will destroy the child's father. Hester agrees to Chillingworth's terms although she suspects she will regret it.|$|E
25|$|The lack of {{wastewater}} treatment {{in some cities}} and towns discharging wastewater into sensitive areas <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter</b> of concern. In January 2008 the European Commission sent France a final warning alerting it {{that it will be}} taken to the European Court of Justice (ECJ) for the second time and possibly face fines unless it quickly brings its waste water treatment up to EU standards. France is not complying with the 1991 EU directive on urban waste water treatment. The deadline for treating all wastewater covered by the directive was 31 December 2000. In 2004 the European Court of Justice (ECJ) condemned France for failing to designate eleven areas as sensitive and for inadequate treatment facilities in a number of settlements which discharge their waste waters into these areas. The ECJ also found that 121 settlements breached the directive by discharging their waste waters into previously designated sensitive areas. In 2006 France designated the eleven areas as sensitive. However, 140 settlements – including the city of Paris – continue to discharge into these sensitive areas. With regard to the 121 settlements discharging into the previously designated sensitive areas France proceeded to rearrange them into 164 settlements, resulting in some settlements no longer meeting the threshold level of 10,000 residents at which the directive applies. The Commission considers such rearranging of settlements to avoid compliance with the directive unacceptable. In November 2009 it referred the matter to the ECJ.|$|E
500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Travis Fickett {{rated the}} episode 7.5/10, {{explaining that he}} liked the [...] "attention to bits of logic that work as the glue, holding the show together" [...] such as Peter's security clearance, but was skeptical of the episode's fringe science. Fickett also noticed many similarities to The X-Files, writing [...] "not enough {{is being done to}} move the show into its own direction"; he concluded [...] "The production values are exceptional, the acting is top notch, and it certainly seems to be going somewhere. Where, <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter</b> all together, but {{there does seem to be}} momentum." [...] Website blogger io9 highlighted [...] "The Arrival" [...] as one of the [...] "crucial" [...] episodes new viewers must watch to understand the show. Jeff Jensen of Entertainment Weekly named [...] "The Arrival" [...] the twelfth best episode of the series, explaining the episode [...] "formally, memorably introduced the Observer known as September (Michael Cerveris), a Tabasco-loving, Fedora-wearing, bald-headed time traveling surveyor from the future. His altercation with Peter in the graveyard — mirroring his movements; parroting his speech in real time — was one of the show's earliest water-cooler-weird moments." ...|$|E

2500|$|Under Ahmadinejad, neo-conservative {{forces are}} {{determined}} to make the Islamic Republic more Islamic than republican.

Some among Iran’s leadership would accept accommodation with the West in exchange for economic and strategic concessions, while others are content to accept isolation from the West.

So, future food-production increases will have to come from higher yields. And though I have no doubt yields will keep going up, whether they can go up enough to feed the population monster <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter.</b> Unless progress with agricultural yields remains very strong, the next century will experience sheer human misery that, on a numerical scale, will exceed the worst of everything that has come before".|$|E

He is later made a Lord by Prince George, and is therefore eligible to sit in the House of Lords – whether or not he ever does so <b>is</b> <b>another</b> <b>matter,</b> as he is never again referred to by his title after episode 1. Baldrick also succeeds where no Baldrick has succeeded before or since, in calling Blackadder [...] "a lazy, big nosed, rubber-faced bastard".|$|E
