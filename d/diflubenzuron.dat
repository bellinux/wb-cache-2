40|$|<b>Diflubenzuron</b> is {{the common}} name for 1 -(4 -chlorophenyl) - 3 -(2, 6 -difluorobenzoyl) urea, the active {{ingredient}} of the insecticide Dimilin. <b>Diflubenzuron</b> was discovered in 1971 as a larvicide. Evidence was provided by several authors that the larvicidal effect of this compound was caused by its interference with chitin synthesis. Chitin {{is one of the}} main components of the insect cuticle. As a result, treatment of larvae with <b>diflubenzuron</b> prevents normal growth of the cuticle in many cases. In most susceptible insect species this effect expresses itself as an incapacity of larvae to moult. During the development of <b>diflubenzuron</b> it was discovered that in some species the compound additionally showed an interesting ovicidal activity, caused either by treatment of females (papers I and II), or by direct contact with eggs (paper II). In paper I is shown that in the housefly (Musca domestica) <b>diflubenzuron</b> can evoke ovicidal effects by topical application to adult females, by oral uptake or by injection of the compound. It is remarkable, however, that in all cases of ovicidal activity the embryo inside the egg appears to develop normally. However, the apparently full-grown embryo turned out to be unable to hatch. Treatment with <b>diflubenzuron</b> did not influence the fecundity of the females. The compound also had no effect on fertilization of the eggs. In order to study the role of male insects in the ovicidal phenomenon, adult males of the housefly (paper I) or of the Colorado potato beetle, Leptinotarsa decemlineata (paper II) were injected with 5 μg of <b>diflubenzuron</b> before they were allowed to mate with untreated females. In this type of experiment no effect on fertilization or on egg mortality was observed. It was therefore concluded that <b>diflubenzuron</b> does not exert its ovicidal activity through the males of these two insect species. Based upon the above mentioned experiments it was concluded that the activity of <b>diflubenzuron</b> on eggs of insects could best be described as an ovicidal effect of the compound rather than a type of chemosterilization. To finally prove that chemosterilization plays no role whatsoever in the mode of action of <b>diflubenzuron,</b> embryos from eggs laid by treated females of the Colorado potato beetle were examined under the electron microscope (paper III, figures 3 and 4). It was found that instead of the normal lamellate cuticle deposition patterns that could be observed in untreated embryos, the <b>diflubenzuron</b> treatment resulted in an amorphous cuticle. Again, these observations suggest an identical mode of action of <b>diflubenzuron</b> on larvae and embryos. As a result, by virtue of a lack of rigidity in the embryonic cuticle, treated embryos cannot use their muscles in the process of egg hatching. We also found that after termination of adult treatment with <b>diflubenzuron,</b> the percentage of egg eclosion again increases. The degree of this reversibility depends a. o. on the concentration of <b>diflubenzuron</b> during the previous treatment (paper I). Many factors appeared to influence the ovicidal activity of <b>diflubenzuron</b> in the case of direct contact activity on susceptible eggs. From the literature there was already evidence that the particle size of the active ingredient plays an important role. In paper II is shown that the susceptibility of eggs of the large cabbage white (Pieris brassicae) decreased with increasing age. With eggs of the Colorado potato beetle we also observed that egg mortality increased with increasing relative humidity. The addition of surfactants to the spray liquid also proved to be necessary sometimes to obtain a sufficient coverage of the eggs. With eggs of the leaf miner Leucoptera scitella we found that the concentration of <b>diflubenzuron</b> in the spray liquid influenced the moment mortality occurred. Generally, at rates of <b>diflubenzuron</b> between 100 and 1 mg a. i. /l, mortality occurred either in the egg stage or in the early larval stages. However, at lower concentrations the contributions of the ovicidal mortality to the overall activity of <b>diflubenzuron</b> decreased. Several aspects of the larvicidal activity of <b>diflubenzuron</b> such as feeding and contact activity, larval behaviour after treatment, and differences in susceptibility are described in paper III. This article also deals with the resumption of normal cuticle deposition in larvae of the Colorado potato beetle, after termination of <b>diflubenzuron</b> treatment, which is illustrated with histological observations. In paper IV a number of benzoylureas, with variations in lipophilic properties were tested for their larvicidal and ovicidal activities on the housefly. In larvicidal tests the compounds were incorporated into the larval culture medium. Ovicidal activities were assessed on female adults either by feeding or by injection. Correlation of biological activities by means of a physical chemical parameter revealed that the ovicidal activity after injection was the basic activity in both the ovicidal activity by adult feeding and in the larvicidal activity. However, in either case this activity was coupled to a lipophilic parameter, which was expressed as πin the octanol/water system. Optimum πvalues for the ovicidal activity after adult feeding and for the larvicidal activity were 1. 0 and 1. 5, respectively. It is likely that at increasing lipophilicity of the compounds above the optimum πvalues, the gut wall becomes an important barrier. Though penetration also decreases when the lipophilicity decreases to below the optimum πvalue, it is possible that the activity at the target site is too low to allow the gut barrier to play an important role. The properties of <b>diflubenzuron</b> in connection with cross-resistance and with the development of resistance in the housefly are described in paper V. Upon selection with <b>diflubenzuron,</b> incorporated into the larval culture medium, development of both larvicidal and ovicidal resistance was studied in a susceptible laboratory strain (S) and in a multiresistant strain (Nic). Due to the decrease in reproductive potential upon progressive selection, the breeding of strain Nic had to be determined in the F 32. Observations for this study with strain S were discontinued in the F 40. The larval resistance against <b>diflubenzuron</b> in both strains increased slowly. The final assessment of larval resistance in strain Nic, which was made in the F 26, showed a 13. 6 -fold decrease in susceptibility when based on LC 50 values. In the F 40 of strain S this factor was 40 -fold. With respect to the egg resistance against <b>diflubenzuron</b> in the F 40 of strain S we measured a similar factor as compared to the larval resistance development. However, in strain Nic the ovicidal resistance proved to increase so rapidly that in the adult feeding experiments in the F 26 even the highest test concentration of 3000 mg a. i. /l, of <b>diflubenzuron</b> in the milk only resulted in an ovicidal activity of 26 %. In two field-collected strains of the housefly, cross-resistance factors for the larvicidal effect were either absent or low (viz. 5). The ovicidal cross'resistance factors for the two field strains were found to be 8. 4 and 87. 5 respectively. Furthermore, the level of ovicidal cross-resistance could probably be related to the resistance of the adults to some standard insecticides tested. Chitin synthesis in the integument not only occurs in embryos and larvae, but also in adult insects during a restricted period after adult emergence. On feeding <b>diflubenzuron</b> to newly hatched adults of the Colorado potato beetle we observed that the elytra remained weak (paper VI). For that end the stiffness of the elytra was measured mechanically as the resistance of the elytra to being punctured. In untreated beetles the mechanical penetrability of the elytra decreases up to about 10 days after adult emergence. At any time during this period we found that this decrease in penetrability could be blocked by administering <b>diflubenzuron</b> to the adults. Also of interest is the fact that concomitant with the effect of <b>diflubenzuron</b> on the penetrability of the elytra, a strong inhibition of chitin formation could be measured. Histological observations of elytra of the Colorado potato beetle revealed several types of mesocuticles. Treatment with <b>diflubenzuron</b> induces characteristic distortions in each of them. In the elytra of treated beetles the thickness of the cuticle, surprisingly, continued to increase. We explained this observation as an indication that protein deposition was not affected by <b>diflubenzuron</b> (paper VI). Quantative data in addition to the histological observations are presented in paper VII. From the experimental data we furthermore concluded that the level of ketocatechols, which parameter can be related to the degree of tanning of the structural proteins, is only partially inhibited by <b>diflubenzuron.</b> However, we observed that, upon feeding adults with <b>diflubenzuron,</b> inhibition of chitin synthesis took place at lower concentrations than its effect on the level of ketocatechols. This might indicate that the interference of <b>diflubenzuron</b> with the tanning process is only of a secondary nature. Based upon experiences with both larvicidal and ovicidal applications, the practical possibilities of <b>diflubenzuron</b> for insect pest control are evaluated in paper III, section 6...|$|E

40|$|The {{effect of}} the {{application}} of ethyl parathion, trichlorfon, <b>diflubenzuron,</b> and Bacillus thuringiensis var. kurstaki to eggs of Erinnyis ello, before and after being parasitized by Trichogramma exiguum and Telenomus sphingis, was studied. Insecticides were also tested on the adults of these parasites and on the adults and pupae of Apanteles congregatus. A methodology to rear A. congregatus was also developed. When ethyl parathion and trichlorfon were applied to eggs before being parasitized, they inhibited parasitism, restrained development of parasites within the eggs, and affected the longevity and productivity of female T. exiguum and T. sphingis from treated eggs. <b>Diflubenzuron</b> and B. thuringiensis {{did not affect the}}se parameters. Ethyl parathion and trichlorfon, applied to parasitized eggs, inhibited the emergence of T. exiguum adults by 80 and 70 percent, and that of T. sphingis by 96 and 91 percent, resp. When females emerging from previously treated E. ello eggs were confined, <b>diflubenzuron</b> or trichlorfon affected longevity and parasitic activity in both species. Trichlorfon had a similar effect when applied to eggs parasitized by Trichogramma. B. thuringiensis had no negative effects. <b>Diflubenzuron</b> and B. thuringiensis did not affect the adults of the 3 parasite species nor the emergence of A. congregatus adults.

40|$|Aedes aegypti (L) (Diptera: Culicidae) was {{reared in}} several {{concentrations}} of <b>diflubenzuron</b> and methoprene under laboratory conditions in Uberlândia, State of Minas Gerais, southeastern Brazil. Characteristics such as LC 50 and LC 95, the susceptibility of immature stages {{of different ages}} to these insect growth regulators and their residual effects were studied. The LC 50 and LC 95 of <b>diflubenzuron</b> and methoprene were 5. 19 and 12. 24 ppb; 19. 95 and 72. 08 ppb, respectively. While <b>diflubenzuron</b> caused great mortality in all larval instars, methoprene was more effective when the mosquito was exposed {{from the start of}} the fourth larval instar onwards. Commercial concentrations of these two insect growth regulators close to LC 95 presented greater residual activity than did their respective technical formulations. The parameters were compared with those obtained elsewhere. The characteristics investigated here indicate that these insect growth regulators are effective alternatives for controlling the dengue vector in the Uberlândia region. Aedes aegypti (L) (Diptera: Culicidae) foi criado em várias concentrações de <b>diflubenzuron</b> e methoprene sob condições de laboratório em Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, sudeste do Brasil.

40|$|<b>Diflubenzuron,</b> a chitin {{synthesis}} inhibitor, {{is used as}} a parasiticide against {{sea lice}} in farmed salmonids. It is administered orally via medicated feed pellets. Due to low bioavailability and biliary secretion of the active drug, <b>diflubenzuron</b> is released into the water column adsorbed to organic particles in faecal matter. Feed spills are also a source of contamination into the environment during medication periods. Consequently, there is a risk that non-target organisms could consume <b>diflubenzuron</b> during and after treatment periods via organic particles from sea pens. Little is known about the pharmacokinetics of <b>diflubenzuron</b> in non-target fish species. In this study, the standard <b>diflubenzuron</b> treatment (3 mg/kg once daily for 14 days) has been administered to Atlantic cod with a mean weight of 104 g (lower and upper bounds 65 and 165 g) at a water temperature of 7. 7 °C, and samples of fillet and skin in natural proportions, liver, terminal colon and bile have been collected during and in the period following the medication period (day 4, 8, 12, 15, 18, 22, 29, 36 and 44). The primary objective has been to determine the tissue levels of <b>diflubenzuron</b> obtained in Atlantic cod, as well as the depuration half lives in the different tissues, through HPLC/MS. A secondary objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate whether PCA, a toxic metabolite of <b>diflubenzuron,</b> is formed in Atlantic cod, through qualitative HPLC/MS/MS analysis of fillet and skin samples. During the medication period, the calculated tissue levels in fillet and skin and liver showed high variability. This is probably due to individual differences in feed consumption, and to a lesser extent differences in absorption. The median tissue levels obtained in fillet and skin and liver were 36. 1 and 106 ng/g, respectively. This is very low compared to Atlantic salmon, in which a mean concentration of 2240 ng/g in fillet and skin has been found at 6 °C 1 day after standard treatment (EMEA, 1999). Furthermore, no fillet and skin samples throughout the medication period exceeded the MRL value of 1000 ng/g. There was a high uncertainty in the calculated depuration half-lives due to low tissue concentrations and high variation between samples, but all half-lives were less than 1 day. PCA was not detected in any of the fillet and skin samples throughout the medication period at a LOD of 2 ng/g. In terms of consumer safety, there appears to be little risk associated with the consumption of wild caught Atlantic cod that may have fed on spills of medicated feed from sea pens during <b>diflubenzuron</b> treatment, because <b>diflubenzuron</b> seems to have a low gastrointestinal uptake in Atlantic cod, and the toxic metabolite PCA was not detected in fillet and skin samples...|$|E
40|$|No. 3 <b>diflubenzuron</b> is {{one type}} of benzoyl N-Phenylurea compound, a type of insect chitin {{synthesis}} inhibitor, and has a unique disinsection mechanism. It can depress the chitinous formation on the insect epidermis, and make it die {{in the process of}} ecdysis or metamorphism. It has particularly effective impact on lepidopterous larvae, and it can control many kinds of pests?such as armyworm, cabbage worm, cotton bollworm?Clanis bilineata, Pine caterpillar, Hyphantria cunea? mosquito screwworm etc. No. 3 <b>diflubenzuron</b> hardly has effect on imagoes, and has low virulence on higher animals; the medium lethal dose of white rats is 15, 000 mg/kg on w/w basis. It has high virulence on target insects, but low virulence on non-target insects. This chemical has no specific smell, does not pollute the environment, and is safe for humans and animals. Thus, it is a new <b>diflubenzuron</b> with high-effect and low-virulence, and could replace some organochlorine insecticides such as DDT, Hexachlorocyclohexane and others. Mythimna separata Walker {{is one of the main}} pests of crops in Jilin Province. The infested area per year is usually 5 – 10 million mu [666. 7 m 2] in the whole province; and it will reach above 10 million mu in years of mass-outbreak. It leads to severe reduction of yield or even no yield if the M. separata are not controlled in time. In order to replace the organo-chlorine pesticides with their highly toxic residue?we have been doing experimental investigations and research on the chitin synthesis inhibitors - No. 1 <b>diflubenzuron</b> and No. 2 <b>diflubenzuron</b> - since 1977. In addition, we have done systemic research on No. 3 <b>diflubenzuron</b> supported by leaders in the Science Committee of our province since 1979. Our results are from indoor control experiments of No. 3 <b>diflubenzuron</b> colloidal suspension M. separata, which was synthesized and provided by the Tonghua Chemical Engineering Institute, and field-plot experiments and demonstration extension experiments within Jilin province.
