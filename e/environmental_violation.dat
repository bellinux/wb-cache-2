Besides the potential technical hazards on uncontrolled construction sites and in finished buildings, illegal building activity can be a major <b>environmental</b> <b>violation</b> when the works encroach upon preserve areas like nature reserves. Likewise, illegal building can have serious political implications when it is practiced as landgrabbing or for illegal settling in foreign territories (see e.g. International law and Israeli settlements).|$|E

30|$|This paper {{starts from}} the {{perspective}} of Corporate Social Responsibility, and focuses on the problem of environmental management on corporate market value. The paper applies the two dimensional research framework, to analyze the external influence and internal influence, resulting in the difference on the stock market after an <b>environmental</b> <b>violation.</b> The major explanatory variables include external norms, time trend and media attention; and internal levels, previous pollution control and previous CSR performance. The empirical research reveals that facing an <b>environmental</b> <b>violation,</b> the Chinese shareholders react negatively. The negative reaction becomes weaker as time goes by, and becomes stronger in the year with heavier media attention. The negative effect is weaker if the company published the CSR report in the previous year.|$|E
30|$|Intuitively, {{it seems}} that <b>environmental</b> <b>violation</b> causes {{economic}} as well as reputational loss, which should result in {{a drop in the}} stock price. However, the Chinese stock market reveals some conflicting statistics. On one hand, VEYONG (600, 803.SH) encountered a drop of 8.34 % in a single day, because of its failure to pass environmental scrutiny; GSRH (600, 311.SH) had 2 days’ stock price decrement after the environmental violation; Resulting from pollution occurring in a subsidiary, the stock price of HPGC (600, 795.SH) decreased by 7.39 %, leading to the whole electricity industry decreasing by 4 %. On the other hand, GUANGJI PHARM (000952.SZ) enjoyed almost a 10 % rise after a pollution accident. And Zijin Mining (601, 899.SH), with an <b>environmental</b> <b>violation,</b> reached the 10 % raising limit for the first trading day, and achieved almost a 50 % increment in total for the first ten trading days. The above cases were sourced from the CNKI data base, the Wind database and the website of the Ministry of Environmental Protection of China.|$|E

40|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>violation</b> is {{an illegal}} act that harms the {{environment}} or endangers public health, offending federal, state or local laws. When the <b>environmental</b> <b>violation</b> is excessive or the violator is a repeat offender, it evolves into environmental crime. Environmental crime {{is a relatively new}} concept and is ever changing. To guarantee the safety and security of the public, environmental laws regulate all activities that {{have a negative effect on}} human health, harm a community or the environment. The citizens' exposure to pollution and/or to dangerous wastes is a major public health problem; therefore, public authorities must act as quickly as possible to identify such environmental issues. An early identification of environmental criticalities would reduce citizens' exposure risks and remediation costs. The most suitable solution to detecting environmental criticalities and preventing environmental crime is targeted and effective environmental monitoring. In this paper it will be shown how our integrated system, which includes aerial platforms and ad-hoc sensors (e. g. infrared cameras, multispectral sensors, etc.), can be an effective tool to ensure environmental and human safety and security. Our monitoring and measurement protocol has been developed to answer the needs of environmental enforcement. Thus the technique demonstrated here can ensure a wide coverage area, is cost effective, in terms both of time and money, and provides highly precise measurements with few false alarms. The proposed procedures, techniques and technologies were tested and validated in environmental police actions directed by Italian government bodies (Public Prosecutor, Environmental Protection Agency, Coast Guard, Financial Police, Forest Rangers etc.) in real, in the field operations...|$|E
30|$|In {{the past}} decades, Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) has {{attracted}} increasing attention, with Corporate Environmental Responsibility (CER or Environmental CSR) playing an ever important role. This paper aims to study {{whether and how}} Chinese shareholders {{are sensitive to the}} disclosure of environmental violations. Specifically, the issue is measured by the performance of the Chinese stock market. In order to answer this question, the authors conduct a two-dimensional “environment-as-a-resource” framework, which assumes that the pressure on stock price after an <b>environmental</b> <b>violation</b> is from both externalities and internalities. The external pressure comes from environmental regulations, media attention, customer sensitivity and so on. The internal pressure is rooted in firm level actions, for example, previous pollution control and previous CSR performance.|$|E
30|$|The {{government}} as a vehicle of environmental scrutiny can have a tremendous impact in raising CSR activities. Dasgupta et al. (1997) finds that the environmental supervision department {{is not the only}} unit to punish pollution, as the capital market also reactions to the event. In this sense, lack of sufficient strong supervision is not the key issue that results in a bad environmental situation. If the capital market receives enough information or the shareholders have better environmental awareness, the pollution event will attract harsher punishment. Considering the result of this paper, Chinese shareholders’ negative reaction to the <b>environmental</b> <b>violation</b> is weaker than that of America and Canada. Information transfer {{may be one of the}} reasons for this.|$|E

30|$|Data from {{developed}} countries exhibit quite {{a significant impact}} of <b>environmental</b> <b>violations</b> on the stock market. For example, the result from the America petrochemical companies shows an average drop of 1.3 % in 2 days’ event window Japan’s public companies (including petrochemical, automobile, food and other industries) appear to have significant share price reductions after <b>environmental</b> <b>violations,</b> for the European market (Ziegler, etc., 2007) and the Indian market, the results are significant.|$|R
30|$|The paper starts by {{addressing}} theories of corporate social responsibility, corporate environmental management and market value management, {{followed by the}} advancement of foreign and domestic research. Then, based on {{the events in the}} Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges from 2002 to 2014, the authors calculate the events’ cumulative abnormal return. The explanatory factors in the regression model include external impacts of time trend and media attention; together with internal impacts of previous pollution situations and CSR performance. Complementing the notion of “environment-as-a-resource”, the regression results reveal that, facing an <b>environmental</b> <b>violation,</b> Chinese shareholders react negatively. The negative reaction becomes weaker as time goes by, and is stronger in the years with heavier media environmental attention.|$|E

Negative information shocks may arise because of sudden product-harm crises or scandals (Klein and Dawar, 2004; Roehm and Tybout, 2006), such as food-borne disease outbreaks or <b>environmental</b> <b>violation</b> practices. In these situations, providing positive brand information can mitigate the effect of negative information shocks on consumers’ brand evaluations and buying intentions (Smith and Vogt, 1995; Okada and Rubstein, 1998; Klein and Dawar, 2004; Roehm and Tybout, 2006).

40|$|Abstract—Waste load {{allocation}} (WLA) policies may use multi-objective optimization {{methods to}} find the most appropriate and sustainable solutions. These usually intend to simultaneously minimize two criteria, total abatement costs (TC) and environmental violations (EV). If other criteria, such as inequity, need for minimization as well, it requires introducing more binary optimizations through different scenarios. In order to reduce the calculation steps, this study presents value index as an innovative decision making approach. Since the value index contains both the <b>environmental</b> <b>violation</b> and treatment costs, it can be maximized simultaneously with the equity index. It implies that the definition of different scenarios for environmental violations is no longer required. Furthermore, the solution is not necessarily the point with minimized total costs or environmental violations. This idea is testified for Haraz River, in north of Iran. Here, the dissolved oxygen (DO) level of river is simulated by Streeter-Phelps equation in MATLAB software. The WLA is determined for fish farms using multi-objective particle swarm optimization (MOPSO) in two scenarios. At first, the trade-off curves of TC-EV and TC-Inequity are plotted separately as the conventional approach. In the second, the Value-Equity curve is derived. The comparative results show that the solutions are in a similar range of inequity with lower total costs. This is due to the freedom of <b>environmental</b> <b>violation</b> attained in value index. As a result, the conventional approach can well be replaced by the value index particularly for problems optimizing these objectives. This reduces the process to achieve the best solutions and may find better classification for scenario definition. It is also concluded that decision makers are better to focus on value index and weighting its contents {{to find the}} most sustainable alternatives based on their requirements.

30|$|Incoherencies between {{different}} conceptualizations of corporate {{reputation in the}} research are outlined in Sects. 3.2. 1.1 and 3.2. 2.1. The results of the bibliometric analyses {{show that there is}} incoherency concerning the scope of corporate characteristics, the scope of stakeholders whose perceptions create reputation, and between what reputation is and what its antecedents and consequences are. Fombrun’s (1996) definition (Table  3)—widely used in the current research on corporate reputation—refers to general actions of a corporation (Table  3). This general formulation implies that every action of a corporation contributes to its reputation—a fact that has already been criticized by Deephouse and Carter (2005). Empirical work shows that, in the end, not all actions have implications for reputation. For example, Karpoff et al. (2005) show that not all actions (in their case <b>environmental</b> <b>violation)</b> influence a corporation’s reputation, but that it depends on whether the stakeholder groups are affected by the action. Reuber and Fischer (2011) analyze discreditable actions of the reputation effects of which depend on perceived control, certainty, and threat or deviance. In addition, external stakeholder motivation and media coverage moderate the probability of a loss of reputation.|$|E

40|$|Problem Climate {{change is}} here now causing {{dramatic}} storms, heat waves and other extreme temperature that affects everyone on earth. The importance {{of environmental issues}} has triggered politicians, governmental bodies and industries to take precautionary measures. This has caution organizations to initiate activities that will reduce {{the damage caused by}} them to the environment although it may involve cost. One of these organisations is the Green Scorpion in South Africa that has prosecuted steel companies in the country for <b>environmental</b> <b>violation.</b> Highveld Steel Limited is one of these companies. This has prompt these steel companies to implement an environmental management system (EMS). The cost and benefits, of introducing such preventive measure makes it advisable to implement a suitable EMS that will be relatively important to the organization interest. Purpose The research is meant to guide the implementation of an environmental management system. This will be the result of steel companies in South Africa to develop an environmental management system that would be realized to suit them. Also, the research will examine the strength, weakness and managerial endeavours of Highveld Steel Limited to implement an efficient environmental management system. Method Qualitative and deduction based research approaches were preferred compared to quantitative and induction research. Grounded theory is the qualitative research method that is used in this research. It was done with caution to confirm and verify the trustworthiness of the data we used with other sources of information and references. Telephone interview was used to collect empirical data. The author beforehand will prepare a questionnaire for interview with a top manager. To accompany the research an extensive literature review will also be undertaken. Not only will this provide a valuable insight into how others have approached this subject area, but it will also ensure that the investigation is not duplicated by any previously undertaken work in addition to ensuring a degree of depth in understanding the concepts and theories involved. Result The research reveals that Environmental Management Implementation Process (EMIP) could help South Africa Steel companies to adopt an appropriate environmental management system. Four main stages were deduced for the proposed EMIP for an environmental management system to be efficient. The four main stages are research, analysis, choice and implementation. The research concludes that EMIP could generate environmental management system (EMS) that would be of interest to stakeholders and enhance better use of resources for Highveld limited. Also, EMIP will ensure that, Implementation of an EMS will not restrain corporate objective achievement...|$|E
