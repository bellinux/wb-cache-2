25|$|Although the Johnson Administration ended {{under the}} cloud of the Vietnam War, Clifford {{concluded}} his short term as Secretary of Defense with his reputation actually enhanced. He got along well with the U.S. Congress, and this helped him to secure approval of {{at least some of}} his proposals. He settled into his duties quickly and efficiently, and capably managed the initial <b>de-escalation</b> of U.S. involvement in Vietnam; indeed, he apparently strongly influenced Johnson in favor of a <b>de-escalation</b> strategy. As he left office to return to his law practice in Washington, Clifford expressed the hope and expectation that international tensions would abate, citing the shift in the Vietnam confrontation from the battlefield to the conference table, and the evident willingness of the Soviet Union to discuss limitations on strategic nuclear weapons.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to acquaint you with some of the approaches we are taking at Langley to incorporate escalations (or <b>de-escalations)</b> of technology when modeling futuristic systems. Since we have a short turnaround between the time we receive enough descriptive information to start estimating the project and when the estimate is needed (the "we-want-it-yesterday syndrome"), creativity is often necessary. There is not much time available for tool development. It is expedient to use existing tools in an adaptive manner to model the situation at hand. Specifically, this paper describes the use of the RCA PRICE MCPLXS Generator to incorporate technology transfer and technology escalation in estimates for advanced space systems such as Shuttle II and NASA advanced technology vehicles. It is assumed that the reader is familiar with the RCA PRICE family of models as well as the RCA PRICE utility programs such as SCPLX, PARAM, PARASYN, and the MCPLXS Generator...|$|R
40|$|Development of {{antibiotic}} resistance in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) is a worldwide problem. The {{purpose of this}} study was to evaluate the effect of an antibiotic stewardship program (ASP) by carbapenems restriction on gram-negative antimicrobial resistance in ICU. The study was designed in a 21 bedded general ICU of a teaching hospital with two wings (one and two) in Tehran, Iran. Carbapenem prescription in ICU 1 was restricted to only the culture proven multi-drug-resistant bacteria with the absence of sensitivity to other antimicrobial agents. Carbapenem had to be prescribed by a trained ICU physician with close consultation with infectious disease specialist and the clinical pharmacist posted in ICU. Post-prescription reviews and <b>de-escalations</b> were carried out by the same team on regular basis. Restriction policy was commenced in January 2011 in ICU 1. All documented infections and resistance patterns of isolated pathogens were recorded in both ICUs during two periods of 6 months before and 9 months after restriction policy implementation. During this study bacterial growth was detected in 51. 5 % of 1601 samples. Carbapenem administration was decreased from 6. 86 to 2. 75 DDD/ 100 patients day (60 % decreases) pre-restriction and post-restriction respectively...|$|R

25|$|In early July 2017, Israel′s defence {{minister}} Avigdor Liberman {{said that while}} ″the rebels are not our friends, they are all versions of al-Qaida”, Israel could not allow a man like Assad to remain in power: “Keeping Assad in power is not in our security interests. As long as he is in power, Iran and Hezbollah will be in Syria.” He said that Israel {{had no interest in}} entering the Syrian civil war, but there were ″red lines″ Israel had set, such as the smuggling of sophisticated weaponry to Hezbollah and Iran′a presence on its borders. Later in July 2017, the Israeli government said it opposed the cease-fire agreement in southern Syria that the United States and Russia had reached a week prior that envisaged establishing <b>de-escalation</b> zones along Syria’s borders with both Jordan and Israel, as that would legalise Iran′s presence in Syria.|$|E
25|$|Most student antiwar {{organizations}} were locally or campus-based {{because they were}} easier to organize and participate in than national groups. Common antiwar demonstrations for college students featured attempts to sever ties between the war machine and universities through burning draft cards, protesting universities furnishing grades to draft boards, and protesting military and Dow Chemical job fairs on campus. From 1969 to 1970, student protestors attacked 197 ROTC buildings on college campuses. Protests grew after the Kent State shootings, radicalizing more and more students. Although the media often portrayed the student antiwar movement as aggressive and widespread, only 10% of the 2500 colleges in the United States had violent protests throughout the Vietnam War years. By the early 1970s, most student protest movements died down due to President Nixon's <b>de-escalation</b> of the war, the economic downturn, and disillusionment with the powerlessness of the antiwar movement.|$|E
40|$|Quick {{and precise}} {{response}} {{is essential for}} riot squads when coping with escalating violence in crowds. Often {{it is just a}} single person, known {{as the leader of the}} gang, who instigates other people and thus is responsible of excesses. Putting this single person out of action in most cases leads to a de-escalating situation. Fostering <b>de-escalations</b> is one of the main tasks of crowd and riot control. To do so, extensive situation awareness is mandatory for the squads and can be promoted by technical means such as video surveillance using sensor networks. To develop software tools for situation awareness appropriate input data with well-known quality is needed. Furthermore, the developer must be able to measure algorithm performance and ongoing improvements. Last but not least, after algorithm development has finished and marketing aspects emerge, meeting of specifications must be proved. This paper describes a multisensor benchmark which exactly serves this purpose. We first define the underlying algorithm task. Then we explain details about data acquisition and sensor setup and finally we give some insight into quality measures of multisensor data. Currently, the multisensor benchmark described in this paper is applied to the development of basic algorithms for situational awareness, e. g. tracking of individuals in a crowd...|$|R
25|$|On November 16, the FARC kidnapped General Rubén Darío Alzate, {{commander}} of the Joint Task Force Titán; Alzate was the first general to be captured by the guerrilla {{in the history of}} the armed conflict. President Santos ordered government negotiators not to travel to Havana until the hostages were released, while the FARC mostly highlighted the political implications of the kidnapping and used it to insist on the need for a bilateral ceasefire. Through mediation, facilitated by the guarantor countries and the International Red Cross, General Alzate was released by his FARC captors on November 30 and handed over to representatives of the Red Cross. As a result of General Alzate's kidnapping, both parties in Havana began talks on <b>de-escalation</b> of the conflict on December 12. On December 17, the FARC announced in a statement that they would be declaring an indefinite unilateral ceasefire beginning on December 20, which would end if guerrilla fronts were attacked by the authorities. This was the FARC's fifth unilateral ceasefire since 2012, and the first indefinite one.|$|E
500|$|In {{support of}} the further {{military}} action in the region, known as Operation Manta, Jaguars were deployed to Bangui, Central African Republic, in 1983, before being rebased inside Chad at N'Djamena International Airport. On 25January1984, Jaguars attacked a rebel column that was withdrawing after raiding the town of Zigey. One aircraft was shot down and the pilot, Captain Michel Croci, was killed; the Libyans denied involvement. The [...] "Manta" [...] forces were withdrawn in 1984, {{as part of a}} <b>de-escalation</b> agreement, whereby both Libyan and French forces were to be withdrawn from Chad. The Libyans did not respect the agreement, and Jaguars returned to Chad in 1986, as part of Operation Epervier, this time with a more forceful role. On 16February1986, 11 Jaguars, escorted by Mirage F-1 fighters and supported by C-135F tankers and Breguet Atlantic aircraft, launched a raid on the airfield at Wadi Doum, which the Libyans had constructed in Northern Chad, using BAP-100 anti-runway bombs. In response to Libyan incursions, another strike was carried out on 7January1987, when a Jaguar destroyed a Libyan radar with a Martel missile. The Jaguars stationed at Ndjamena were a target for Libyan sabotage owing to their effectiveness against enemy forces, but the attempts were unsuccessful.|$|E
500|$|Throughout 1969 and 1970, Cooper and Senator Frank Church co-sponsored the Cooper–Church Amendments, {{aimed at}} curbing further {{escalation}} of the Vietnam War. Congressional approval {{of one of these}} amendments on December 15, 1969, de-funded the use of U.S. troops in Laos and Thailand. Cooper had wanted to include a restriction on forces entering Cambodia as well, but Mike Mansfield, who helped Cooper write the amendment, feared that Cambodian Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who was officially neutral in the conflict, might be offended. When Sihanouk was deposed in 1970, Cambodia's new leader, Lon Nol, appealed to President Nixon for help in stabilizing his rule. Nixon agreed to send troops to Cambodia, despite protests from Cooper and others that this violated his stated goal of <b>de-escalation</b> in the region. Cooper and Church then drafted another amendment to de-fund U.S. operations in Cambodia; after negotiations with Nixon that continued funding until July 1970 so that the troops already in the country could be evacuated, the amendment passed 58–37. The House of Representatives later stripped the amendment from the legislation to which it was attached, and it did not go into effect. The amendment was nevertheless hailed by The Washington Post as [...] "the first time in our history that Congress has attempted to limit the deployment of American troops in the course of an ongoing war." [...] The fight over the Cooper–Church Amendments took its toll on Cooper's health, and he was briefly hospitalized to regain his strength. In 1971, Church, Mansfield, and George Aiken convinced Cooper to help them write an amendment to end U.S. involvement in Southeast Asia altogether, but ultimately, the measure did not have the support to pass and was abandoned.|$|E
