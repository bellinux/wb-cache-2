This study shows a growing income inequality between different groups of the Thai population. However, the country's poverty levels, whether expressed {{as a percent of}} the total population or in absolute terms, have reduced significantly. These contrasting results are explained by two main factors: natural resource endowments and the effects of government policies on income distribution. Growth patterns and <b>income</b> <b>structures</b> in each region, especially in the agricultural sector, are primarily determined by natural resource endowments. These regional and sectoral endowments are either strengthened or weakened by government policies.

50|$|CT 5350030.00 has {{experienced}} a significant shift in <b>income</b> <b>structure</b> between the 2006 Census, and 2011 National Household Survey. In the 2006 Census, 61.1% of residents earned less than $20,000 annually. This data creates a left-skewed distribution that suggests a primarily low-income population. However, by the 2011 National Household Survey, such low-income residents decreased by a fifth to constitute 40.4% of residents. This was offset by a tripling of those earning greater than $60,000 to represent 25.6% of the population. This data creates a beta distribution which suggests {{a significant portion of}} residents making less than $20,000 but also a growing portion of residents making greater than $60,000. Consequently, two alternative perspectives can be derived from such data. Either the historical residents have experienced increasing incomes or, low-income residents can no longer afford housing in the neighbourhood and are experiencing displacement. Further research is required to determine better assess the changes in <b>income</b> <b>structure</b> and potential factors.

50|$|He {{collected}} and analyzed statistical indicators of economic performance of 14 countries in Europe, the U.S. and Japan for 60 years. Analysis {{of the materials}} led {{to the advancement of}} a number of hypotheses relating to various aspects of the mechanism of economic growth, concerning the level and variability of growth, structure of the GNP and distribution of labor, the distribution of income between households, the structure of foreign trade. Kuznets founded the historically grounded theory of economic growth. The central theme of these empirical studies is that the growth of the aggregated product of the country necessarily implies a profound transformation of the whole of its economic structure. This transformation affects many aspects of economic life - the structure of production, sectoral and occupational structure of employment, the division of occupations among family and market activities, the <b>income</b> <b>structure,</b> size, age structure and spatial distribution of the population, cross-country flows of goods, capital, labor and knowledge, the organization of industry and governmental regulation.

40|$|Taking Jiangsu and Xinjiang Provinces in China as examples, {{this paper}} {{analyzes}} the differences of income level, <b>income</b> <b>structure</b> and consumption level between {{eastern and western}} China. Since the reform and opening up, income of rural residents in eastern China has been much higher than that in western China. Income gap between eastern and western rural residents is increasing over time. Rural per capita net income in eastern area is mainly the net income from household management and the wage income. However, rural per capita net income in western area is relatively single, mainly the net income from household management. Living consumption of eastern rural residents {{is higher than the}} western rural residents and the gap is gradually widening. Four factors affecting the consumption level of rural residents in both eastern and western areas are discussed, which are natural environment, social culture, economic and technical level and policy system. According to the relevant data in the years 1993 - 2007, Regression Analysis Method is adopted to study on the effect of <b>income</b> <b>structure</b> on consumption level of rural residents in eastern and western China. Result shows that according to the structure of income sources, difference of consumption level between eastern and western areas is mainly caused by the difference of wage income; while differences of net income from household management and property transferred income have little effect on the difference of living consumption level. Based on this, relevant suggestions are put forward. On the one hand, western region should accelerate the promotion of urban-rural integration, make great efforts to develop secondary and tertiary industries in order to optimize the <b>income</b> <b>structure</b> of rural residents, and effectively improve the level of wage income of rural residents. On the other hand, eastern area should promote the coordinated development of three industries, and maintain the advantages in urbanization and industrialization levels. <b>Income</b> <b>structure,</b> Consumption level, Differences between eastern and western China, Empirical analysis, Agricultural Finance, Financial Economics,...|$|E
