5|$|The National Cancer Institute {{estimated}} 22,070 {{new cases}} of primary brain cancer and 12,920 deaths due to the illness in the United State in 2009. The age-adjusted incidence rate is 6.4 per 100,000 per year, and the death rate is 4.3 per 100,000 per year. The lifetime risk of developing brain cancer for someone born today is 0.60%. Only around {{a third of those}} diagnosed with brain cancer survive for five years after diagnosis. These high overall mortality rates are a result of the prevalence of aggressive types, such as <b>glioblastoma</b> multiforme.

25|$|In 29–66% of <b>glioblastomas,</b> DNA repair is {{deficient}} due to epigenetic methylation of the MGMT gene, {{which reduces}} protein expression of MGMT.

Thus, in 28% of <b>glioblastomas,</b> increased expression of miR-181d and reduced expression of DNA repair enzyme MGMT may be a causal factor.|$|R

Until recently, therapies for tumors that recur after standard treatment have been largely ineffective. Recent phase II studies with the humanized monoclonal antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor bevacizumab suggest that this agent is active in recurrent <b>glioblastomas,</b> producing response rates of 26 - 40 % and prolonging 6 -month progression-free survival to 36 - 50 %.

25|$|Furthermore, <b>glioblastoma</b> multiforme {{exhibits}} numerous {{alterations in}} genes that encode for ion channels, including upregulation of gBK potassium channels and ClC-3 chloride channels. It has been hypothesized that by upregulating these ion channels, <b>glioblastoma</b> tumor cells can facilitate increased ion movement over the cell membrane, thereby increasing H2O movement through osmosis, which aids <b>glioblastoma</b> cells in changing cellular volume very rapidly. This is helpful in their extremely aggressive invasive behavior, because quick adaptations in cellular volume can facilitate movement through the sinuous extracellular matrix of the brain.|$|E
25|$|Mutations in and {{overexpression}} of ion {{channels are}} important events in cancer cells.

Here, to gain the mechanistic insights on the molecular phenotypes of recurrent <b>glioblastomas,</b> gene expression profiling {{was performed on the}} 43 cases of <b>glioblastomas</b> including 15 paired primary and recurrent cases. Unsupervised clustering analyses revealed two subtypes of G 1 and G 2, which were characterized by proliferation and neuron-like gene expression traits, respectively. While the primary tumors were classified as G 1 subtype, the recurrent <b>glioblastomas</b> showed two distinct expression types. Compared to paired primary tumors, the recurrent tumors in G 1 subtype did not show expression alteration. By contrast, the recurrent tumors in G 2 subtype showed expression changes from proliferation type to neuron-like one. We also observed the expression of stemness-related genes in G 1 recurrent tumors and the altered expression of DNA-repair genes (i. e., AURK, HOX, MGMT, and MSH 6) in the G 2 recurrent tumors, which might be responsible for the acquisition of drug resistance mechanism during tumor recurrence in a subtype-specific manner. We suggest that recurrent <b>glioblastomas</b> may choose two different strategies for transcriptomic reprograming to escape the chemotherapeutic treatment during tumor recurrence. Our results might be helpful to determine personalized therapeutic strategy against heterogeneous glioma recurrence...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} {{the feasibility of}} using susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) to discriminate abscesses and necrotic tumours. Methods: Twenty-one patients with pyogenic abscesses, 21 patients with rim-enhancing <b>glioblastomas</b> and 23 patients with rim-enhancing metastases underwent SWI. Intralesional susceptibility signal (ILSS) was analyzed employing both qualitative (QL) and semi-quantitative (SQ) methods. Logistic regression models and receiver operating characteristic analysis were used to demonstrate the discriminating power. Results: In QL analysis, ILSSs were seen in 12 of 21 abscesses, in 20 of 21 <b>glioblastomas,</b> and in 16 of 23 metastases. In SQ analysis, a low degree of ILSS (85. 8 %) was {{in the majority of}} abscesses and a high degree of ILSS (76. 2 %) was in the majority of <b>glioblastomas.</b> SQ model was significantly better than QL model in distinguishing abscesses from <b>glioblastomas</b> (P <. 001). A derived ILSS cutoff grade of 1 or less was quantified as having a sensitivity of 85. 7 %, specificity of 90. 5 %, accuracy of 88. 1 %, PPV of 90. 0 %, and NPV of 86. 4 % in distinguishing abscesses from <b>glioblastomas.</b> Conclusions: A high-grade ILSS may help distinguish <b>glioblastomas</b> from abscesses and necrotic metastatic brain tumours. The lack of ILSS or low-grade ILSS can be a more specific sign in the imaging diagnosis of abscesses. Key Points: • ILSS of SWI can contribute to differential diagnosis of rim-enhanced mass. • Low-grade ILSS can be a more specific sign in abscesses. • High-grade ILSS may help distinguish necrotic <b>glioblastomas</b> from abscesses. • ILSS spreads across the four ILSS categories in metastases. © 2014 European Society of Radiolog...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} value of spectroscopic and {{perfusion}} MRI for glioma grading and for distinguishing <b>glioblastomas</b> from metastases and from CNS lymphomas. Methods: The authors examined 79 consecutive patients with first detection of a brain neoplasm on nonenhanced CT scans and no therapy prior to evaluation. Spectroscopic MRI; arterial spin-labeling MRI for measuring cerebral blood flow (CBF); first-pass dynamic, susceptibility-weighted, contrast-enhanced MRI for measuring cerebral blood volume; and T 1 -weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI were performed. Receiver operating characteristic analysis was performed, and optimum thresholds for tumor classification and glioma grading were determined. Results: Perfusion MRI had a higher diagnostic performance than spectroscopic MRI. Because of a significantly higher tumor blood flow in <b>glioblastomas</b> compared with CNS lymphomas, a threshold value of 1. 2 for CBF provided sensitivity of 97 %, specificity of 80 %, positive predictive value (PPV) of 94 %, and negative predictive value (NPV) of 89 %. Because CBF was significantly higher in peritumoral nonenhancing T 2 -hyperintense regions of <b>glioblastomas</b> compared with metastases, a threshold value of 0. 5 for CBF provided sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 100 %, 71 %, 94 %, and 100 %. <b>Glioblastomas</b> had the highest tumor blood flow values among all other glioma grades. For discrimination of <b>glioblastomas</b> from grade 3 gliomas, sensitivity was 97 %, specificity was 50 %, PPV was 84 %, and NPV was 86 % (CBF threshold value of 1. 4), and for discrimination of <b>glioblastomas</b> from grade 2 gliomas, sensitivity was 94 %, specificity was 78 %, PPV was 94 %, and NPV was 78 % (CBF threshold value of 1. 6).

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} {{diagnostic}} performance of dynamic susceptibility contrast-enhanced perfusion MRI {{before and after}} mathematic contrast leakage correction in differentiating pyogenic brain abscesses from <b>glioblastomas</b> and/or metastatic brain tumors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cerebral blood volume (CBV), leakage-corrected CBV and leakage coefficient K 2 were measured in enhancing rims, perifocal edema and contralateral normal appearing white matter (NAWM) of 17 abscesses, 19 <b>glioblastomas</b> and 20 metastases, respectively. The CBV and corrected CBV were normalized by dividing the values in the enhancing rims or edema to those of contralateral NAWM. For each study group, a paired t {{test was used to}} compare the K 2 of the enhancing rims or edema with those of NAWM, as well as between CBV and corrected CBV of the enhancing rims or edema. ANOVA was used to compare CBV, corrected CBV and K 2 among three lesion types. The diagnostic performance of CBV and corrected CBV was assessed with receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis. RESULTS: The CBV and correction CBV of enhancing rim were 1. 45 ± 1. 17 and 1. 97 ± 1. 01 for abscesses, 3. 85 ± 2. 19 and 4. 39 ± 2. 33 for <b>glioblastomas,</b> and 2. 39 ± 0. 90 and 2. 97 ± 0. 78 for metastases, respectively. The CBV and corrected CBV in the enhancing rim of abscesses were significantly lower than those of <b>glioblastomas</b> and metastases (P =  0. 001 and P =  0. 007, respectively). In differentiating abscesses from <b>glioblastomas</b> and metastases, the AUC values of corrected CBV (0. 822) were slightly higher than those of CBV (0. 792). CONCLUSIONS: Mathematic leakage correction slightly increases the diagnostic performance of CBV in differentiating pyogenic abscesses from necrotic <b>glioblastomas</b> and cystic metastases. Clinically, DSC perfusion MRI may not need mathematic leakage correction in differentiating abscesses from <b>glioblastomas</b> and/or metastases...|$|R
