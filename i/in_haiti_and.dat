5|$|Alpha dumped torrential rain on {{the island}} of Hispaniola, making it the eighth wettest storm to impact poverty-stricken Haiti. It caused 26deaths, 17 of them <b>in</b> <b>Haiti</b> <b>and</b> all of them caused by floods and rain-related landslides. Roads were blocked for weeks and {{hundreds}} of houses were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Alberto was {{indirectly}} {{responsible for}} two deaths when it made landfall in Florida. Hurricane Ernesto caused heavy rainfall <b>in</b> <b>Haiti,</b> <b>and</b> directly {{killed at least}} seven <b>in</b> <b>Haiti</b> <b>and</b> the United States. Four hurricanes formed after Ernesto, including the strongest storms of the season, Hurricanes Helene and Gordon. In total, the season was responsible for 14deaths and $500million (2006USD; $ USD) in damage. The calendar year 2006 also saw Tropical Storm Zeta, which arose in December 2005 and persisted until early January, only the second such event on record. The storm {{can be considered a}} part of the 2005 and 2006 seasons, although it occurred outside the June 1 – November 30 period during which most Atlantic basin tropical cyclones form.|$|E

5|$|Bush also {{expressed}} U.S. {{support for the}} defense of Taiwan following the stand-off in April 2001 with the People's Republic of China over the Hainan Island incident, when an EP-3E Aries II surveillance aircraft collided with a People's Liberation Army Air Force jet, leading to the detention of U.S. personnel. From 2003 to 2004, Bush authorized U.S. military intervention <b>in</b> <b>Haiti</b> <b>and</b> Liberia to protect U.S. interests. Bush condemned the militia attacks Darfur and denounced the killings in Sudan as genocide. Bush said that an international peacekeeping presence was critical in Darfur, but opposed referring the situation to the International Criminal Court.|$|E

5|$|Orson Welles' stage {{production}} of Macbeth sets the play <b>in</b> <b>Haiti,</b> <b>and</b> casts the witches as voodoo priestesses. As with earlier versions, {{the women are}} bystanders {{to the murder of}} Banquo, as well as Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene. Their role in each of these scenes suggests they were behind Macbeth's fall in a more direct way than Shakespeare's original portrays. The witches encroach further and further into his domain as the play progresses, appearing in the forest in the first scene and in the castle itself by the end. Directors often have difficulty keeping the witches from being exaggerated and overly-sensational.|$|E
5|$|Göring {{was born}} on 12 January 1893 at the Marienbad Sanatorium in Rosenheim, Bavaria. His father, Heinrich Ernst Göring (31 October 1839– 7 December 1913), a former cavalry officer, {{had been the first}} Governor-General of the German {{protectorate}} of South-West Africa, (modern-day Namibia). Heinrich had five children from a previous marriage. Göring was the fourth of five children by Heinrich's second wife, Franziska Tiefenbrunn (1859–15 July 1943), a Bavarian peasant. Göring's elder siblings were Karl, Olga, and Paula; his younger brother was Albert. At the time that Göring was born, his father was serving as consul general <b>in</b> <b>Haiti,</b> <b>and</b> his mother had returned home briefly to give birth. She left the six-week-old baby with a friend in Bavaria and did not see the child again for three years, when she and Heinrich returned to Germany.|$|E
5|$|The ships {{then began}} a peacetime {{training}} routine off {{the east coast}} of the United States and the Caribbean, including gunnery training off the Virginia Capes, training cruises in the Atlantic, and winter exercises in Cuban waters. In late 1909, Virginia, Georgia, and Rhode Island visited French and British ports. Throughout their careers, political unrest in several Central American countries prompted the United States to send the ships to protect American interests in the region. New Jersey was sent to Cuba to assist the Cuban Pacification in support of the government of President Tomás Estrada Palma. All five ships became involved in the Mexican Revolution as the United States intervened to protect its nationals living in the country, culminating in the occupation of Veracruz in April 1914. New Jersey was also sent to protect American interests <b>in</b> <b>Haiti</b> <b>and</b> the Dominican unrest in 1914.|$|E

5|$|Language contact {{may also}} lead {{to a variety of}} other {{linguistic}} phenomena, including language convergence, borrowing, and relexification (replacement of much of the native vocabulary with that of another language). In situations of extreme and sustained language contact, it may lead to the formation of new mixed languages that cannot be considered to belong to a single language family. One type of mixed language called pidgins occurs when adult speakers of two different languages interact on a regular basis, but in a situation where neither group learns to speak the language of the other group fluently. In such a case, they will often construct a communication form that has traits of both languages, but which has a simplified grammatical and phonological structure. The language comes to contain mostly the grammatical and phonological categories that exist in both languages. Pidgin languages are defined by not having any native speakers, but only being spoken by people who have another language as their first language. But if a Pidgin language becomes the main language of a speech community, then eventually children will grow up learning the pidgin as their first language. As the generation of child learners grow up, the pidgin will often be seen to change its structure and acquire a greater degree of complexity. This type of language is generally called a creole language. An example of such mixed languages is Tok Pisin, the official language of Papua New-Guinea, which originally arose as a Pidgin based on English and Austronesian languages; others are Kreyòl ayisyen, the French-based creole language spoken <b>in</b> <b>Haiti,</b> <b>and</b> Michif, a mixed language of Canada, based on the Native American language Cree and French.|$|E
