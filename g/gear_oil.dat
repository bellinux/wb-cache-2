2500|$|In late 2008, an all-new seven-speed {{longitudinal}} S tronic {{version of}} the DSG transaxle went into series production (Volkswagen Group internal code: DL501, parts code prefix: 0B5). Initially, from early 2009, it is only used in certain Audi cars, and only with longitudinally mounted engines. Like the original six-speed DSG, it features a concentric dual wet multi-plate clutch. However, this particular variant uses notably more plates — the larger outer clutch (for the odd-numbered gears) uses 10 plates, whereas the smaller inner clutch (driving even-numbered gears and reverse) uses 12 plates. Another notable change over the original transverse DSGs is the lubrication system [...] — Audi now utilise two totally separate oil circuits. One oil circuit, consisting of , lubricates the hydraulic clutches and mechatronics with fully synthetic specialist automatic transmission fluid (ATF), whilst the other oil circuit lubricates the gear trains and front and centre differentials with [...] of conventional hypoid <b>gear</b> <b>oil.</b> This dual circuit lubrication is aimed at increasing overall reliability, due to eliminating cross-contamination of debris and wear particles. It has a torque handling limit of up to , and engine power outputs of up to [...] It has a total mass, including all lubricants and the dual-mass flywheel of [...]|$|E

50|$|This {{transmission}} has {{a separate}} oil for the differential in the transmission, {{so there are}} two fluid levels to check. The differential fluid is checked by unscrewing the speed sensor gear assembly {{and use it as}} a dipstick. The speed sensor gear assembly is located on top of the transmission just above the right inner CV joint. Differential is emptied by removing the final drive cover on the rear of the transmission or by vacuum extraction through the speed sensor hole. Vacuum extraction is the more attractive option since a paper gasket seals the steel cover and access is very difficult. Filling is through the speed sensor hole. Differential oil capacity is about 1 liter. An acceptable differential oil is Redline synthetic MT-90 75W90 <b>gear</b> <b>oil</b> or any synthetic 75W90 GL4 <b>gear</b> <b>oil.</b> Be very careful not to introduce sand or dust into the differential, as the differential has no way to filter its oil.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{rheological}} behaviour of several fully formulated <b>gear</b> <b>oils</b> is characterized: two mineral-based oils, one poly-a-olefin, and three ester-based oils. Experimental traction curves were obtained on a mini-traction machine, where the selected <b>gear</b> <b>oils</b> were submitted to numerous traction tests combining several temperatures, contact loads, and rolling speeds. Having obtained the experimental {{data from the}} traction tests, it was least-squares fitted to a rheological model (elasto-viscoplastic rheological model) {{in order to obtain}} the model’s govern-ing parameters: elastic modulus and limiting shear stress and their dependence on pressure and temperature. This study presents both the traction tests results and the fitted rheological param-eters, and discusses the similarities and differences between the oils, as well as the influence of the operating conditions on the behaviour of the oil...|$|R

50|$|The Class 8 {{had severe}} {{problems}} with water leaking into the <b>gear</b> <b>oil.</b> When discovered in January 1985, all the trams were grounded.

This proved to not be sufficient, and further tests were performed by the Norwegian Institute of Technology. Eventually the problems were fixed.|$|E
