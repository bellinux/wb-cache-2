The embodied knowledge is then diffused within the new environment creating spillovers and leading to productivity improvements. A theoretical framework is presented wherein productivity growth is modelled through knowledge acquisition with respect to <b>labour</b> <b>mobility.</b> The empirical estimates confirm the existence of positive cross-sectoral knowledge spillovers and indicate that <b>labour</b> <b>mobility</b> has beneficial effects on industry productivity.

In the thesis <b>labour</b> <b>mobility</b> in two Swedish ICT clusters is studied. The {{purpose of the}} thesis is to {{develop an understanding of}} processes of <b>labour</b> <b>mobility</b> in clusters and to investigate whether mobility can be regarded as a cluster advantage. Both interview data and extensive registry data are used in order to analyse processes of mobility at three levels: individual, firm and cluster level. The results show that <b>labour</b> <b>mobility</b> can to some extent be considered a cluster advantage for Swedish ICT firms, since cluster firms are likely to experience a higher level of <b>labour</b> <b>mobility.</b> It is also shown how mobility to and from the clusters contributes to the upgrading of formal competencies within cluster firms. However, the firms themselves are shown to rather focus on staff retention than turnover. To some degree, <b>labour</b> <b>mobility</b> in the Swedish clusters in focus is presumably constrained by the formal institutional framework, as well as by informal rules and agreements between cluster firms. It is argued nonetheless that the sheer potential for mobility and the viability of informal hiring practices in clusters may be viewed as cluster advantages, besides the actual extent of <b>labour</b> <b>mobility...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{identify}} the most important knowledge gaps on interprovincial barriers to <b>labour</b> <b>mobility</b> in Canada, and to shed some light on potential conceptual, methodological, and data issues associated with research in this area. Consequently, it provides an overview of the current state of play with respect to the most important issues relating to inter-provincial barriers to <b>labour</b> <b>mobility</b> within the Canadian internal market. The three main barriers to <b>labour</b> <b>mobility</b> in Canada, which are considered, are: residency requirements; certain practices regarding occupational licensing, certification and registration; and differences in how occupational qualifications are recognized. These are the main regulatory barriers that are to be removed or reduced under Chapter 7, the <b>Labour</b> <b>Mobility</b> Chapter of the Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT). It also reviews critically the recent relevant research in Canada and in some other jurisdictions (the United States, the European Union and Australia) on barriers to <b>labour</b> <b>mobility.</b> The paper finds that the most important knowledge gap concerns the extent of the regulatory barriers to <b>labour</b> <b>mobility</b> and their impacts and costs. It also concludes that there is nothing fundamentally wrong with the approach of mutual recognition being pursued in Canada to eliminate such regulatory barriers. However, while there has been a fair degree of success in Canada in achieving occupation-specific Mutual Recognition Agreements for occupational qualifications and reconciliation of differences in occupational standards, this progress has been too slow. Moreover, the functioning of the dispute resolution mechanism with respect to Chapter 7, is overly complex and inaccessible. The dispute resolution mechanism in the Alberta-B. C.

This interest reflects the large growth of international skilled <b>labour</b> <b>mobility,</b> especially during the 1980 s. Attention of prior research has focused on the migratory movement of managers and professionals as they radiate across the globe, recording and representing the dispersal of international investment and the overseas expansion of producers of goods and services.

The research undertaken addresses the varying theoretical, conceptual and methodological approaches of prior research on international skilled <b>labour</b> <b>mobility</b> in geography, as well as in other disciplines, such as management studies and occupational psychology. In doing so, the interplay between work and non-work spheres in shaping Scottish international skilled <b>labour</b> <b>mobility</b> is highlighted, as is the differing temporal and spatial focus of existing studies.
