40|$|We {{describe}} algorithms for {{the determination}} of fast movement strategies for a step-and-scan <b>wafer</b> <b>stepper,</b> a device that {{is used for the}} photolithographic processing of integrated circuits. The proposed solution strategy consists of two parts. First, we determine the maximum number of congruent rectangular chips that can be packed on a wafer, subject to the restriction that the chips are placed in a rectangular grid. Second, we find fast movement strategies for scanning all chips of a given packing, given the mechanical restrictions of the <b>wafer</b> <b>stepper.</b> The corresponding combinatorial optimization problem is formulated as a generalized asymmetric traveling salesman problem. We show how feasible scan strategies are determined, and how these strategies are improved by local search techniques, such as iterative improvement based on 2 - and 3 -exchanges, and simulated annealing based on 2 -exchanges. ...|$|R
40|$|Research into {{characterization}} of <b>wafer</b> <b>stepper</b> systems {{has been done}} primarily by analyzing a series of wafer exposures. This method {{does not allow for}} easy separation {{of the effects of the}} exposure system and the resist processing system. In addition, determination of the transfer characteristics of projection lithographic lenses is typically done before the lens system is installed into the <b>wafer</b> <b>stepper</b> system. A method is presented which allows for the in-situ determination of the modulation transfer function. This method separates the processing effects from those of the exposure system. Scattered light from a polys il icon edge is shown to be in close agreement with the theoretical MTF as calculated by SAMPLE. Focus effects on the resultant MTF curves are demonstrated. A comparison between single and multiple scattering lines demonstrates that there is little difference in the MTF curves...|$|R

40|$|Vibrations within high-precision {{machines}} are often badly damped, and may easily {{show up as}} {{a major factor in}} limiting the achievable accuracy. As it is hard to damp these vibrations by passive means, active vibration control may become inevitable within such machines. Robust active damping can be obtained by applying integral force feedback to so-called ‘Smart Discs’, i. e., active structural elements consisting of a piezoelectric position actuator and a collocated piezoelectric force sensor, which are inserted at appropriate locations within a machine frame. A <b>wafer</b> <b>stepper,</b> i. e., the advanced microlithography system that {{is at the heart of}} integrated circuit manufacturing, is an excellent example of a high-precision machine with a frame that has low structural damping. Badly damped vibrations of the lens of the <b>wafer</b> <b>stepper</b> may in future limit the attainable line width of the circuit patterns. For this reason an active lens support, based on Smart Discs, is developed. Experiments with the active lens support show that the relative damping of the dominant vibration modes of the lens is increased from 0. 2 % to 16 %, which effectively results in 86 % reduction of the vibration amplitude...|$|R
40|$|The Laser Step Alignment (LSA) is a through- the-lens, field-by-field {{alignment}} system {{developed for}} an optical step- and- repeat {{system with a}} reduction projection lens (<b>wafer</b> <b>stepper)</b> intended for one micron or submicron lithography. The laser beam used for LSA is focused on a wafer through the projection lens. The alignment marks on the wafer are {{in the shape of}} diffraction gratings. The mark detection is performed by moving the wafer stage so that the alignment mark travels across the laser beam. The passage of the align-ment mark produces diffracted and scattered light, which is photo- electrically detected as the alignment signal. The position of the alignment mark is accurately measured by the laser interferomter attached to the wafer stage. The LSA system achieves overlay accuracy (2 aa) less than 0. 15 um for processed wafers. LSA uses a 633 nm He-Ne laser, so the photoresist is not sensitive to it, and LSA is well applicable to multilayer resist processes. The alignment time is about 0 - 6 seconds per shot in field-by-field mode. This LSA is attached to the Nikon <b>wafer</b> <b>stepper</b> (NSR), so field-by- field alignment, several types of alignment, and other measurement for compensa-tion are performed. An appropriate alignment may be selected to meet the accuracy and throughput required in each case...|$|R

40|$|The use {{of linear}} permanent-magnet (PM) {{actuators}} increases {{in a wide}} variety of applications because of the high force density, robustness and accuracy. The paper describes the modelling of a linear PM motor applied in, for example, <b>wafer</b> <b>steppers,</b> including magnetic saturation. This is important because to reach high performance, the feedforward control must predict the force generated by the motor, also when the motor is saturated. The motor is modelled as a reluctance network. The saturating parts of the magnetic circuit are modelled as variable reluctances and magnetomotive forces represent the currents and the magnets. In saturation, a current leading the no-load voltage results in an increase of the generated force. The good correlation between the calculated and the measured force justifies the model...|$|R

Integration is present both within and between modules; even more so for complex systems like <b>wafer</b> <b>steppers,</b> aircraft, and medical imaging systems.
