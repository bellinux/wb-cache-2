40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an experimental study on the section moment capacity of cold-formed steel beams with rectangular hollow flanges. The new Rectangular Hollow <b>Flange</b> <b>Beam</b> (RHFB) is fabricated using a unique manufacturing process in which two cold-formed rectangular hollow flanges are screw fastened to a web plate. It possesses unique stress-strain characteristics and initial imperfections that are different from conventional open cold-formed steel sections and welded hollow <b>flange</b> <b>beam</b> sections. In this study, the section moment capacity of RHFBs was investigated using a series of full scale bending tests. Twenty two section moment capacity tests of RHFBs were conducted on short span flexural members with simply supported end conditions for three steel grades G 300, G 500 and G 550 and varying thicknesses. Test capacity results were compared with the capacities predicted by the current design rules in the Australian and North American steel design standards, AS 4100, AS/NZS 4600 and AISI S 100, to verify their applicability to RHFBs. The results show that although the current design rules based on effective width principles predicted the section moment capacities of RHFBs slightly unconservatively in comparison to test results, they can be used for RHFBs provided a suitable screw spacing is used. However, the Direct Strength Method (DSM) based design rules are found to predict the section moment capacity of this new screw-fastened hollow <b>flange</b> <b>beam</b> section conservatively in most cases. This research shows that the DSM based design rules including the new inelastic reserve bending capacity provisions in AISI S 100 can be used to predict the section moment capacities of both screw-fastened and welded hollow <b>flange</b> <b>beam</b> sections conservatively...|$|E

This paper presents the details of finite element models developed to simulate fifteen back to back, four-point bending tests, previously carried out by the authors to investigate the section moment capacities of rivet fastened RHFCBs.

The ultimate moment capacities from the tests and finite element analyses were compared with currently available design standards: AS/NZS 4600, AS 4100 and AISI S 100.

However, their shear capacities are determined based on conservative design rules.

40|$|The {{intermittently}} rivet fastened Rectangular Hollow Flange Channel Beam (RHFCB) {{is a new}} cold-formed {{hollow section}} proposed {{as an alternative to}} welded hollow flange channel beams. It is a monosymmetric channel section made by intermittently rivet fastening two torsionally rigid rectangular hollow flanges to a web plate. This process enables the end us-ers to choose an effective combination of different web and flange plate sizes to achieve op-timum design capacities. Recent research studies focused mainly on the shear behaviour of the most commonly used lipped channel beam and welded hollow <b>flange</b> <b>beam</b> sections with and without web openings. However, no research has been undertaken on the shear behav-iour and strength of rivet fastened RHFCBs with web openings. Hence a detailed experi-mental study involving 30 shear tests was undertaken to investigate the shear behaviour and strength of rivet fastened RHFCBs with circular web openings. Simply supported test spec-imens of RHFCB with aspect ratios of 1. 0 and 1. 5 were loaded at mid-span until failure. Comparison of experimental shear capacities with corresponding predictions from the cur-rent Australian cold-formed steel design rules showed that the current design rules are inad-equate for the shear design of rivet fastened RHFCBs with circular web openings.

It is characterized by a unique geometry, consisting of two rectangular hollow flanges and a web. Unlike other cold-formed sections, the RHFCB has improved capacity due to its mono-symmetric shape and the absence of free edges. The RHFCB manufacturing involves fastening two hollow flanges to a web, utilizing inexpensive intermittent self-pierced rivet fastening.

40|$|The use of cold-formed steel {{structures}} is increasing rapidly {{around the world}} due to the many advances in construction and manufacturing technologies and relevant standards. However, the structural behaviour of these thin-walled {{steel structures}} is characterised by a range of buckling modes such as local buckling, distortional buckling or flexural torsional buckling. These buckling problems generally lead to severe reduction and complicated calculations of their member strengths. Therefore {{it is important to}} eliminate or delay these buckling problems and simplify the strength calculations of cold-formed steel members. The Hollow <b>Flange</b> <b>Beam</b> with two triangular hollow flanges, developed by Palmer Tube Mills Pty Ltd in the mid- 1990 s, has an innovative section that can delay the above buckling problems efficiently. This structural member is considered to combine the advantages of hot-rolled I-sections and conventional cold-formed sections such as C- and Z-sections (Dempsey, 1990). However, this structural product was discontinued in 1997 due to the complicated manufacturing process and the expensive electric resistance welding method associated with severe residual stresses (Doan and Mahendran, 1996). In this thesis, new fastening methods using spot-weld, screw fastener and self-pierced rivet were considered for the triangular Hollow Flange Beams (HFBs) and the new rectangular hollow flange beams (RHFBs). The structural behaviour of these types of members in axial compression was focused in this research project. The objective of this research was to develop suitable design models for the members with triangular and rectangular hollow flanges using new fastening methods so that their behaviour and ultimate strength can be predicted accurately under axial compression. In the first stage of this research a large number of finite element analyses (FEA) was conducted to study the behaviour of the electric resistance welded, triangular HFBs (ERW-HFBs) under axial compression. Experimental results from previous researchers were used to verify the finite element model and its results. Appropriate design rules based on the current design codes were recommended. Further, a series of finite element models was developed to simulate the corresponding HFBs fastened using lap-welds (called LW-HFBs) and screw fasteners or spot-welds or self-piercing rivets (called S-HFBs). Since the test specimens of LW-HFBs and S-HFBs were unavailable, the finite element results were verified by comparison with the experimental results of ERW-HFB with reasonable agreement. In the second stage of this research, a total of 51 members with rectangular hollow flanges including the RHFBs made from a single plate and 3 PRHFBs made from three plates fastened with spot-welds and screws was tested under axial compression. The finite element models based on the tests were then developed that included the new fasteners, contact simulations, geometric imperfections and residual stresses. The improved finite element models were able to simulate local buckling, yielding, global buckling and local/global buckling interaction failure associated with gap opening as agreed well with the corresponding full-scale experimental results. Extensive parametric studies for the RHFBs made from a single plate and the 3 PRHFBs made from three plates were undertaken using finite element analyses. The analytical results were compared with the predictions using the current design rules based on AS 4100, AS/NZS 4600 and the new direct strength method. Appropriate design formulae based on the direct strength method for RHFBs and 3 PRHFBs were developed. This thesis has thus enabled the accurate prediction of the behaviour and strength of the new compression members with hollow flanges and paved the way for economical and efficient use of these members in the industry...|$|E
40|$|Until recently, the {{hot-rolled}} steel {{members have}} been recognized as {{the most popular and}} widely used steel group, but in recent times, the use of cold-formed high strength steel members has rapidly increased. However, the structural behavior of light gauge high strength cold-formed steel members characterized by various buckling modes is not yet fully understood. The current cold-formed steel sections such as C- and Z-sections are commonly used because of their simple forming procedures and easy connections, but they suffer from certain buckling modes. It is therefore important that these buckling modes are either delayed or eliminated to increase the ultimate capacity of these members. This research is therefore aimed at developing a new cold-formed steel beam with two torsionally rigid rectangular hollow flanges and a slender web formed using intermittent screw fastening to enhance the flexural capacity while maintaining a minimum fabrication cost. This thesis describes a detailed investigation into the structural behavior of this new Rectangular Hollow <b>Flange</b> <b>Beam</b> (RHFB), subjected to flexural action The first phase of this research included experimental investigations using thirty full scale lateral buckling tests and twenty two section moment capacity tests using specially designed test rigs to simulate the required loading and support conditions. A detailed description of the experimental methods, RHFB failure modes including local, lateral distortional and lateral torsional buckling modes, and moment capacity results is presented. A comparison of experimental results with the predictions from the current design rules and other design methods is also given. The second phase of this research involved a methodical and comprehensive investigation aimed at widening the scope of finite element analysis to investigate the buckling and ultimate failure behaviours of RHFBs subjected to flexural actions. Accurate finite element models simulating the physical conditions of both lateral buckling and section moment capacity tests were developed. Comparison of experimental and finite element analysis results showed that the buckling and ultimate failure behaviour of RHFBs can be simulated well using appropriate finite element models. Finite element models simulating ideal simply supported boundary conditions and a uniform moment loading were also developed in order to use in a detailed parametric study. The parametric study results were used to review the current design rules and to develop new design formulae for RHFBs subjected to local, lateral distortional and lateral torsional buckling effects. Finite element analysis results indicate that the discontinuity due to screw fastening has a noticeable influence only for members in the intermediate slenderness region. Investigations into different combinations of thicknesses in the flange and web indicate that increasing the flange thickness is more effective than web thickness in enhancing the flexural capacity of RHFBs. The current steel design standards, AS 4100 (1998) and AS/NZS 4600 (1996) are found sufficient to predict the section moment capacity of RHFBs. However, the results indicate that the AS/NZS 4600 is more accurate for slender sections whereas AS 4100 is more accurate for compact sections. The finite element analysis results further indicate that the current design rules given in AS/NZS 4600 is adequate in predicting the member moment capacity of RHFBs subject to lateral torsional buckling effects. However, they were inadequate in predicting the capacities of RHFBs subject to lateral distortional buckling effects. This thesis has therefore developed a new design formula to predict the lateral distortional buckling strength of RHFBs. Overall, this thesis has demonstrated that the innovative RHFB sections can perform well as economically and structurally efficient flexural members. Structural engineers and designers should make use of the new design rules and the validated existing design rules to design the most optimum RHFB sections {{depending on the type of}} applications. Intermittent screw fastening method has also been shown to be structurally adequate that also minimises the fabrication cost. Product manufacturers and builders should be able to make use of this in their applications...|$|E

40|$|The LiteSteel Beam (LSB) {{is a new}} hollow flange {{channel section}} {{developed}} by OneSteel Australian Tube Mills using a patented Dual Electric Resistance Welding technique. The LSB has a unique geometry consisting of torsionally rigid rectangular hollow flanges and a relatively slender web. It is commonly used as rafters, floor joists and bearers and roof beams in residential, industrial and commercial buildings. It is on average 40 % lighter than traditional hot-rolled steel beams of equivalent performance. The LSB flexural members are subjected to a relatively new Lateral Distortional Buckling mode, which reduces the member moment capacity. Unlike the commonly observed lateral torsional buckling of steel beams, lateral distortional buckling of LSBs is characterised by simultaneous lateral deflection, twist and web distortion. Current member moment capacity design rules for lateral distortional buckling in AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005) {{do not include the}} effect of section geometry of hollow <b>flange</b> <b>beams</b> although its effect is considered to be important. Therefore detailed experimental and finite element analyses (FEA) were carried out to investigate the lateral distortional buckling behaviour of LSBs including the effect of section geometry. The results showed that the current design rules in AS/NZS 4600 (SA, 2005) are over-conservative in the inelastic lateral buckling region. New improved design rules were therefore developed for LSBs based on both FEA and experimental results. A geometrical parameter (K) defined as the ratio of the flange torsional rigidity to the major axis flexural rigidity of the web (GJf/EIxweb) was identified as the critical parameter affecting the lateral distortional buckling of hollow <b>flange</b> <b>beams.</b> The effect of section geometry was then included in the new design rules using the new parameter (K). The new design rule developed by including this parameter was found to be accurate in calculating the member moment capacities of not only LSBs, but also other types of hollow <b>flange</b> steel <b>beams</b> such as Hollow <b>Flange</b> <b>Beams</b> (HFBs), Monosymmetric Hollow <b>Flange</b> <b>Beams</b> (MHFBs) and Rectangular Hollow <b>Flange</b> <b>Beams</b> (RHFBs). The inelastic reserve bending capacity of LSBs has not been investigated yet although the section moment capacity tests of LSBs in the past revealed that inelastic reserve bending capacity is present in LSBs. However, the Australian and American cold-formed steel design codes limit them to the first yield moment. Therefore both experimental and FEA were carried out to investigate the section moment capacity behaviour of LSBs. A comparison of the section moment capacity results from FEA, experiments and current cold-formed steel design codes showed that compact and non-compact LSB sections classified based on AS 4100 (SA, 1998) have some inelastic reserve capacity while slender LSBs do not have any inelastic reserve capacity beyond their first yield moment. It was found that Shifferaw and Schafer’s (2008) proposed equations and Eurocode 3 Part 1. 3 (ECS, 2006) design equations can be used to include the inelastic bending capacities of compact and non-compact LSBs in design. As a simple design approach, the section moment capacity of compact LSB sections can be taken as 1. 10 times their first yield moment while it is the first yield moment for non-compact sections. For slender LSB sections, current cold-formed steel codes can be used to predict their section moment capacities. It was believed that the use of transverse web stiffeners could improve the lateral distortional buckling moment capacities of LSBs. However, currently there are no design equations to predict the elastic lateral distortional buckling and member moment capacities of LSBs with web stiffeners under uniform moment conditions. Therefore, a detailed study was conducted using FEA to simulate both experimental and ideal conditions of LSB flexural members. It was shown that the use of 3 to 5 mm steel plate stiffeners welded or screwed to the inner faces of the top and bottom flanges of LSBs at third span points and supports provided an optimum web stiffener arrangement. Suitable design rules were developed to calculate the improved elastic buckling and ultimate moment capacities of LSBs with these optimum web stiffeners. A design rule using the geometrical parameter K was also developed to improve the accuracy of ultimate moment capacity predictions. This thesis presents the details and results of the experimental and numerical studies of the section and member moment capacities of LSBs conducted in this research. It includes the recommendations made regarding the accuracy of current design rules as well as the new design rules for lateral distortional buckling. The new design rules include the effects of section geometry of hollow <b>flange</b> steel <b>beams.</b> This thesis also developed a method of using web stiffeners to reduce the lateral distortional buckling effects, and associated design rules to calculate the improved moment capacities...|$|R

The rigid frame with rectangular hollow section columns and with wide <b>flange</b> <b>beams</b> are analyzed to three ground motions. Strength of frame, the number of story, strength ratio of menber and width-to-thickness ratio are selected as the analytical parameters. Generally, this type of frame results in the weak panel type or weak beam type structure, so that the overrall collapse mechanism is formed to the static seismic load.

Hence an experimental study was conducted to investigate the web crippling behaviour and capacities of rivet fastened RHFCBs under End Two Flange (ETF) and Interior Two Flange (ITF) load cases. Experimental results showed that the current design rules are unconservative for rivet fastened RHFCB sections under ETF and ITF load cases. Hence new equations were proposed to determine the web crippling capacities of rivet fastened RHFCBs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of non-linear finite element analyses on two types of improved steel moment-resisting connections, either reinforced with cover plates or weakened with RBS detail: the aim is to protect the potentially vulnerable beam-to-column groove welded joint by relocating the plastic hinge away {{from the face of the}} column. The investigation is based on results from experimental tests carried out on a two-storey steel frame tested at Ispra and involves the modeling of the 3 -way beam-to-column joints. Numerical analyses on reinforced joints show that fracture indices decrease in the weld region and near the weld access hole respect to the unreinforced connection, but high values of the Triaxiality Index are registered in the weld at the column interface. In order to eliminate the high shear stress in the <b>beam</b> <b>flange</b> and to reduce the high triaxial stress condition at the <b>beam</b> flange-column <b>flange</b> interface, the <b>beam</b> <b>flange</b> was disconnected from the column <b>flange.</b> The reduced <b>beam</b> section detail provided both in the top and bottom <b>beam</b> <b>flanges</b> reduces the vulnerability of the connection to the occurrence of a fracture near the weld: yielding is concentrated within the reduced section of the beam where large inelastic strains are registered...|$|R
