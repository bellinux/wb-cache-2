This article investigates whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> harder {{for new and}} costly policy issues to reach the government agenda when the economy <b>is</b> <b>performing</b> <b>badly.</b> We examine whether, {{and the extent to}} which, costly gender equality issues regarding women’s access to the labour market, equal treatment at work and care activities, are more likely to achieve executive attention when the economy <b>is</b> <b>performing</b> well. Using the Comparative Policy Agendas database, we conduct a systematic, quantitative analysis of when and why policies promoting sex equality in the division of labour reach executive agendas. Our findings confirm that advocacy for costly gender equality measures is easier to make in times of economic growth. We also find that female representation in parliament strengthens advocacy for executive attention and reduces friction on policy agenda change...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Discrete {{diagnosis}} {{systems have}} traditionally included {{the ability to}} model unknown faults. However, this ability has not been available in hybrid diagnosis approaches. This is because one weakness of the standard approaches to tracking the hybrid state—Kalman filters and particle filters—is that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> hard to tell when they <b>are</b> <b>performing</b> poorly. In this paper we show that by using a particle filter with look-ahead we can measure in a principled way when the filter <b>is</b> <b>performing</b> <b>badly</b> and hence the system may be in an unmodelled state. We show that this approach {{can be used to}} detect unknown faults in a small realistic domain. In addition, we show that for a common class of faults we can learn a model of the unknown state so as to predict it better in the future. This is one step on the way to being able to enhance an existing hybrid model by learning unmodelled states and adding them to the model. 1...|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} {{claims about the}} diversification benefits of real estate. In particular, does real estate investment in a mixed asset portfolio provide protection when other asset classes <b>are</b> <b>performing</b> <b>badly?</b> Conventional portfolio strategy models utilising covariance statistics {{may result in a}} misallocation of capital if correlation structures between assets differ across the distribution of returns. Models of asymmetric dependence using the copula function, drawn from the recent finance literature are used to examine the relationships between real estate and equity at different points in their joint return distributions. For both UK and Global markets, real estate securities and common equities are shown to exhibit strong tail dependence [...] particularly in the negative tail. This suggests that real estate securities offer, at best, limited diversification protection when <b>it</b> <b>is</b> needed most [...] when other asset markets are falling. This has implications for allocation strategies in mixed asset portfolios...|$|R
40|$|A bank’s {{interest}} expenses {{are found to}} increase with its degree of internationalization as proxied by its share of foreign liabilities in total liabilities or a Herfindahl index of international liability concentration, especially if the bank <b>is</b> <b>performing</b> <b>badly.</b> Our benchmark estimation suggests that an international bank’s cost of funds raised through a foreign subsidiary is between 1. 5 % and 2. 4 % higher {{than the cost of}} funds for a purely domestic bank, which is a sizeable difference given an overall mean cost of funds of 3. 3 %. These results are consistent with limited incentives for national authorities to bail out an international bank, but also with an international bank recovery and resolution process that is inefficient. In any event, the operation of the financial safety net appears to be a barrier to cross-border banking. ...|$|R

40|$|Late {{coming to}} school {{has become a}} major problem in many schools, {{particularly}} township schools with serious consequences. Current research has demonstrated that many schools in South Africa <b>are</b> <b>performing</b> <b>badly</b> due to inefficient use of the teaching and learning time. In this article, we argue that while major administrative interventions are undertaken {{to improve the quality of}} learning and teaching, it seems that very little attention is paid to late-coming. Late-coming has become a cancer that saps away big interventions and strays the performance of selected township schools in a different direction. The purpose of this research is to investigate the causes of late-coming among high school students in selected secondary schools of Shoshanguve. A qualitative approach was used to draw data from high school students in selected secondary schools of Shoshanguve. The findings reveal that late-coming is common among learners in selected secondary schools of Shoshanguve. It happens every day for varying reasons. We recommended practical solutions ranging from administrative improvement to learner behavioural change...|$|R
40|$|At {{this time}} of recession, many {{companies}} <b>are</b> <b>performing</b> <b>badly</b> and some become acquisition targets. Once acquired, the General Manager needs to consider how to turn around the acquired company. Existing studies of turnarounds suggest a uniform approach to {{the early stages of}} management, but this is based on analysing stand-alone companies rather than acquired ones. Amongst acquisitions <b>it</b> <b>is</b> well known that there are different integration styles, but studies of mergers and acquisitions have not focused upon how poorly <b>performing</b> companies <b>are</b> managed. This paper asks (1) should acquired companies in poor financial health be managed as other acquired companies and (2) should they follow turnaround literature prescriptions? Using a novel mixed method approach, cluster analysis techniques reveal the existence of two distinct integration strategies for poor performing target companies, and qualitative interviews provide explanation of these findings. For General Managers this means that their strategy options should not be limited to the 'classic' turnaround strategies set out in the existing literature but should recognise that there are different ways to manage poor health acquisitions...|$|R

Compared with gestation and birthweight, CRIB was better for the prediction of mortality, was as good for the prediction of morbidity, and was not as good for the prediction of length of stay.
