5|$|On 15 May 1971, Banks was {{involved}} in a notorious incident with George Best who, while playing against England for Northern Ireland, <b>flicked</b> <b>the</b> ball out of Banks' hands and headed it into the net. The move was audacious, but was disallowed by the referee, who judged it to be dangerous play. Banks played his 73rd and final game for England on 27 May 1972, in a 1–0 win over Scotland at Hampden Park. During his 73 international games he kept 35 clean sheets and lost just nine games.|$|E

Two minutes later, Trautmann collected the ball {{at the end of}} a Birmingham attack and kicked the ball long to Dyson, over the heads of the retreating Birmingham players. Dyson <b>flicked</b> <b>the</b> ball on to Bobby Johnstone, who scored Manchester City's third, becoming the first player ever to score in consecutive Wembley finals in the process.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea's {{route to}} the final began in the third round, with a trip to Carrow Road to face Norwich City. An uneventful tie, with Carlo Cudicini making a series of saves to deny Norwich {{finished}} goalless and was replayed at Stamford Bridge. Goals from Mario Stanić and Frank Lampard put Chelsea in a commanding lead and Gianfranco Zola scored the team's third with a unique piece of skill. From a corner, the Italian made a near-post run and <b>flicked</b> <b>the</b> ball airborne. Chelsea finished the match 4–0 winners and were drawn to face West Ham United in the next round. Frédéric Kanouté's late goal cancelled out Jimmy Floyd Hasselbaink's opener for Chelsea and the tie was replayed at Upton Park the following Wednesday night. West Ham went a goal up when Jermain Defoe scored for West Ham, but their lead was short-lived as Hasselbaink directly from a free-kick. Defoe restored the home side's advantage in the 50th minute, though substitute Mikael Forssell came on to equalise for Chelsea and in stoppage time John Terry headed-in goalwards from a corner to complete the visitors comeback.|$|E

25|$|Australia won the Test, only just, by 13-12 on a wet and windy Athletic Park. Another one-point margin. We had it {{won more}} comfortably than it looked until David Campese, {{who was at}} fullback, made a mistake {{towards the end of}} the game. Standing in a tackle, he <b>flicked</b> <b>the</b> ball back infield where it was snapped up by All Black centre Joe Stanley who then popped up a pass as he was being tackled to {{breakaway}} Mark Brooke-Cowden for a try beside the posts.

Ella gave Campese room and Tuynman hung about waiting to play his part. Campese drew the last serious defender to him, <b>flicked</b> <b>the</b> ball to Tuynman and moved into place for the return. It worked like a dream and there was Campese with half the pitch to run and only John Beattie near him. Beattie did well to stay the same three metres behind Campese as they hurtled down the touchline, {{but there was never}} a doubt that Campese would score...Campese's effort won the try-of-the-tour award from the brewers.|$|E
25|$|He was {{recognized}} as an inspiring speaker. In August 1924, he {{was transferred to the}} Saint Bonaventure convent in Detroit, where he worked until 1945. During this time, he mostly served as the simple porter (or receptionist and doorkeeper). Each Wednesday afternoon, he conducted well-attended services for the sick, and through these services, he became known for his great compassion and the amazing results of his consultations with visitors. People considered him instrumental in cures and other blessings. He loved to kneel before the Eucharist in the quiet of the night; Father Benedict Groeschel once recalled visiting the convent on a warm night and being unable to sleep. Around 3:00am, Groeschel took a walk and arrived at the chapel where he put on two lights and saw Casey kneeling on the top step of the altar. Groeschel observed him for several moments and noted that Casey didn't move – Groeschel simply <b>flicked</b> <b>the</b> lights off to leave Casey to his prayer.|$|E

25|$|England's {{chances of}} lasting the day were {{effectively}} dashed after Kevin Pietersen <b>flicked</b> <b>the</b> ball to Damien Martyn at short midwicket off Brett Lee {{in the first}} over of the day, immediately after Australia's taking the new ball and without adding to his overnight score. Geraint Jones struck a few boundaries but edged onto his stumps off Glenn McGrath. Fellow NSW paceman Stuart Clark took the final wickets of Giles (caught at first slip), Hoggard (caught at first slip) and Harmison (caught pulling at fine leg), with England lasting only 20 overs for the day. England's fourth innings total of 370 was the highest ever achieved in a fourth innings of a Test match at the Gabba but was still nowhere near the total set by Australia. Australia won the match by 277 runs, with Ricky Ponting named man of the match for his 196 and 60 not out. The total attendance was recorded as 164,747 for the match.|$|E
25|$|After an {{international}} break which saw Sebastian Giovinco further cement {{his place in}} Italy coach Cesare Prandelli's plans for Euro 2012 the following summer, Parma travelled to Champions League side Napoli, who had beaten giants Internazionale in their previous game by three goals to nil. Napoli had much of {{the ball in the}} early stages, but failed {{to make the most of}} their control of the ball, while Parma looked dangerous on the counter. This pattern continued into the second half before a Massimo Gobbi goal give Parma an unexpected lead just before an hour had passed. The left-back surged forward through Napoli's pedestrian midfield and laid the ball off to Sergio Floccari, who <b>flicked</b> <b>the</b> ball back into Gobbi's path, allowing Gobbi to slot home from point blank range. Napoli continued to press and eventually found an equaliser in a similar fashion to Parma's opener, Ezequiel Lavezzi supplying the backheel flick and playing the one-two with substitute Giuseppe Mascara. The sides were level for five minutes before Parma once again proved to have the more clinical instinct in front of goal. Francesco Valiani worked the ball out wide to Giovinco, who found Francesco Modesto sliding in at the back post to give Parma a 2–1 in the 82nd minute to momentarily put Parma seventh.|$|E
25|$|Pietersen scored 50 in England's opening game in Sri Lanka {{against the}} Sri Lankan Cricket XI, {{but it took}} until the fourth ODI for Pietersen to find form, scoring 63 not out as England won their first series in Sri Lanka. This form was still {{fluctuating}} in the warm-up matches for the Test series, scoring 4, 1 and 59 against the Sri Lankan Cricket XI. This run continued in the Test matches when in the first test he got two starts with 31 and 18 but didn't go on. He was unfortunate as in the second innings on 18 he was bowled by a ball that kept low from Dilhara Fernando. In the second test he managed 45 not out to secure a draw in the 2nd Test. In the first innings, Pietersen's dismissal {{was to be the}} source of much controversy. He edged his fifth ball to Chamara Silva at slip, who <b>flicked</b> <b>the</b> ball up for wicketkeeper Kumar Sangakkara to complete the catch. The two on-field umpires conferred over the validity of the catch, as it was unclear whether the ball had touched the ground prior to Silva flicking the ball up. Daryl Harper, standing at the bowler's end gave the decision that the wicket had been taken, but while walking off the field, Pietersen saw a replay on the big screen and questioned the validity of the decision. This led for calls for similar catches to be referred to the third (TV) umpire, but this can only take place if the on-field umpires have not made a decision. Pietersen passed 3,000 Test runs during the series, becoming the fastest player (by time) to do so, He only averaged 25.20, and failed to score a half century in a series for the first time.|$|E

His first goal where he <b>flicked</b> <b>the</b> ball over a defender before volleying into the corner of the net, was selected {{as one of the best}} goals in the history of the World Cup. Following Pelé's second goal, Swedish player Sigvard Parling would later comment; [...] "When Pelé scored the fifth goal in that Final, I have to be honest and say I felt like applauding". When the match ended, Pelé passed out on the field, and was revived by Garrincha. He then recovered, and was compelled by the victory to weep as he was being congratulated by his teammates. He finished the tournament with six goals in four matches played, tied for second place, behind record-breaker Just Fontaine, and was named best young player of the tournament.|$|E
500|$|An own goal {{scored by}} Stephen Clemence gave Arsenal a 1–0 {{victory in the}} first week of October at home to Birmingham City.

[...] A penalty scored by Robert Pirès was enough to secure three points against Manchester City. The midfielder wasted a second penalty in the second half, choosing to recreate a spot kick executed by Johan Cruyff and Jesper Olsen for Ajax. Having attempted to roll the ball towards onrushing Henry, Pirès inadvertently <b>flicked</b> <b>the</b> ball twice, enabling referee Mike Riley to award a free-kick to Manchester City. Although both players were scrutinised by Chelsea manager José Mourinho, they were commended by Cryuff for showing a desire to try something different. The final league match of October ended in a 1–1 draw against local rivals Tottenham Hotpsur.|$|E

[...] Gooch's highest Test score is 333, which he made in the first innings against India in 1990. [...] As of January 2013, this is the third-highest Test score by an Englishman (after Len Hutton's 364 and Wally Hammond's 336 not out), and is the equal twelfth-highest score in Test history.

In their next match, away to Blackburn Rovers, another error by Lehmann – this time letting David Dunn's shot slip through his fingers and into the goalnet, meant the team drew 1–1. Cesc Fàbregas scored the winning goal against Manchester City, ten minutes {{before the end of}} the match. The result was followed with what The Guardian described as a [...] "fluent attacking display" [...] at home to Portsmouth, on the first day of September. Arsenal faced local rivals Tottenham Hotspur after a week-long international break and went a goal behind when Gareth Bale’s free-kick beat goalkeeper Manuel Almunia, past the net.
