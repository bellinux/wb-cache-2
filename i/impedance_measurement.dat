Measurements of impedance may be carried out at one frequency, or the variation of device impedance over a range of frequencies may be of interest. The impedance may be measured or displayed directly in ohms, or other values related to impedance may be displayed; for example, in a radio antenna, the standing wave ratio or reflection coefficient may be more useful than the impedance alone. The {{measurement of}} impedance requires the {{measurement of the}} magnitude of voltage and current, and the phase difference between them. Impedance is often measured by [...] "bridge" [...] methods, similar to the direct-current Wheatstone bridge; a calibrated reference impedance is adjusted to balance off the effect of the impedance of the device under test. <b>Impedance</b> <b>measurement</b> in power electronic devices may require simultaneous measurement and provision of power to the operating device.|$|E

The distance-dependent impedance signals from multiple fiber electrodes were also characterized.
