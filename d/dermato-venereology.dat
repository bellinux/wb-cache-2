40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{examine the}} sexual {{behaviour}} and {{the prevalence of}} sexually transmitted diseases (STD) among females attending an inner-city STD clinic before and after safer sex campaigns. SUBJECTS [...] In 1984 981 women and in 1988 684 women were interviewed immediately after the venerological examination. SETTING [...] Department of <b>Dermato-Venereology,</b> Bispebjerg Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark. METHODS [...] In a face to face interview, details of symptoms, age at coitarche, {{number of sexual partners}} (lifetime and during the last year), obstetric history, and contraceptive methods were recorded. RESULTS [...] A substantially higher proportion of women used condoms in 1988 than in 1984. A dramatic decrease in the prevalence of gonorrhoea occurred (from 22 % in 1984 to 6 % in 1988, p < 0. 01), whereas {{an increase in the number}} of patients with genital warts was observed (from 4 % in 1984 to 10 % in 1988, p < 0. 05). The prevalence of chlamydia, genital herpes, and cervical dysplasia remained unchanged. No significant changes in the number of sexual partners, or the frequency of sexual intercourse or unplanned pregnancy could be detected from 1984 to 1988. CONCLUSIONS [...] The safer sex campaigns have only been partly successful, as a general reduction in all sexually transmitted diseases should be expected as a result of the increased use of condoms. Future campaigns should focus on the correct use of condoms, and encourage a lifestyle with stable sexual relationship...|$|E

Gentamycin is widely used while mupirocin is the first line therapy to eliminate MRSA. This research is intended to observe the colonization of MSRA case in AD patients and its sensitivity to mupirocin compared to gentamycin in <b>Dermato-venereology</b> Clinic Dr. Hasan Sadikin General Hospital Bandung. An analytical cross sectional survey was intended from 19 th September– 31 st October 2011 in 22 moderate to severe AD patients based on objective Scoring Atopic Dermatitis and 22 healthy persons. All subjects went through skin-scraping, MSRA was detected and sensitivity test was done for mupirocin and gentamycin. The subjects consisted of 10 boys and 12 girls in both group. Based on severity, 10 / 22 of AD subjects were in moderate AD and 12 / 22 were severe AD, 14 / 22 of AD subjects presented with acute lesions and 8 / 22 subjects had chronic lesions. In the group of AD patients, 17 / 22 growth of S. aureus were found with sensitivity against mupirocin 14 / 17 and gentamycin 11 / 17. In healthy individual group, no S. aureus growth was found. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus strain in AD patients was observed on 3 / 17 patients, and this was declared significantly different compared to healthy individuals (p < 0. 01). The isolates in 2 / 3 patients were sensitive to mupirocin and all patients were resistant to gentamycin. In conclusion, the patients of moderate to severe AD are prone to MRSA colonization and therefore requires mupirocin topical antibiotic treatment...|$|E
40|$|Association between atopy and {{development}} of allergic contact dermatitis (ACD) remains controversial. T cell disfunctions in a patient with atopy complicate the process of nickel sensitization. On the other, the decrease of the skin barrier function and overexpression of Langerhans cells in the patient facilitate the sensitization.   This study aimed to evaluate the association between atopy and incidence of nickel ACD. A case-control study {{was carried out in}} Allergic and Immunology Sub Department of <b>Dermato-Venereology</b> Policlinic, Dr. Sardjito General Hospital, Yogyakarta, involving 54 nickel ACD patients as case group and 74 healthy subjects as control group. All subjects underwent prick test allergens i. e. house dust, dust mite, cockroach, mixed fungi, nuts and egg white. The skin reaction was considered as a positive result if a wheal diameter of at least 3 mm larger than the negative control or a minimum of half of the positive control. The relationship between atopy and the nickel ACD incidence was analyzed using Chi-Square test with confidence interval (CI) of 95 %. A significant association between atopy and the nickel ACD incidence was observed in this study. Subjects with atopy to  ≥ 1 allergen had risk of nickel ACD 3. 74 higher than subjects without atopy (odds ratio/OR= 3. 74; 95 %CI = 1. 64 - 8. 53).   Furtheremore, subjects with atopy to  ≥ 2 allergens had risk of nickel ACD 3. 74 higher than subjects without atopy (OR= 2. 08; 95 %CI = 1. 01 - 4. 29).

40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{determine}} {{the prevalence of}} Chlamydia trachomatis infection in women attending a family planning clinic in Papua New Guinea, in the period between April and June 1991. SETTING [...] The outpatient department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology of Port Moresby General Hospital, Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea, the departments of <b>Dermato-Venereology</b> and Clinical Microbiology of the Erasmus University, Rotterdam, The Netherlands and the National Institute of Public Health and Environmental Protection, Bilthoven, The Netherlands. PATIENTS [...] A total of 254 consecutive women who attended the family planning clinic at Port Moresby General Hospital, Papua New Guinea were enrolled into this study. METHODS [...] Cervical infections with C trachomatis were diagnosed using the direct immunofluorescent assay (DFA) and the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Serum IgM and IgG antibodies directed against C trachomatis were detected using the enzyme-linked fluorescent assay (ELFA). RESULTS [...] The prevalence of C trachomatis was 14. 6 % using the PCR, 9. 1 % using the DFA and 17. 3 % when {{the results of the}} PCR and the DFA were combined. An elevated IgM titre was observed in 14. 2 % of the women, whereas 44. 1 % had an elevated IgG titre. The titres of IgM or IgG were significantly higher in women who were positive using the PCR or the DFA than in those who were negative in both the PCR and the DFA (p = 0. 032 and p = 0. 0046, respectively). CONCLUSION [...] Cervical infection by C trachomatis can be considered a major health problem in at least the studied population in Papua New Guinea. The prevalence of C trachomatis infection is at least comparable with that in groups with a high prevalence in industrialized countries. Effective screening and treatment programmes are imperative to combat this problem...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Portugal has {{the highest}} {{prevalence}} rate of HIV infection in Western Europe. The proportion of patients with a late diagnosis, carried out in full-blown AIDS stage, remains high. Skin and mucous membrane manifestations are not rare in these patients. OBJECTIVE: A demographic, clinical, and laboratorial characterization of patients with de novo HIV infection diagnosis made in the Department of Dermatology and Venereology of a central hospital in Lisbon, Portugal. METHODS: Retrospective review of medical records of adult patients newly diagnosed with HIV infection (reactive immunoassay for antibodies to HIV- 1 /HIV- 2 or HIV p 24 antigen) in the Dermatology and Venereology Department of a Portuguese central hospital in the period between January 2005 and December 2013. RESULTS: During the study period, 97 new cases were diagnosed, 70 men and 27 women. The median age at diagnosis was 36 years. Of the total, 50 cases were diagnosed with a concomitant sexually transmitted infection (STI), more frequently syphilis and ano-genital HPV infection. The remaining 47 patients were diagnosed with other dermatological conditions such as prurigo nodularis, psoriasis, and Kaposi's sarcoma. The duration of complaints that lead to medical attention ranged from < 1 week to 8 years, being significantly lower in patients diagnosed with a concomitant STI (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). Basal viral load was also lower in this group of patients (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Of all the new diagnosed cases, 80 % of patients are currently retained in care. CONCLUSION: This study grants a descriptive overview of de novo HIV infection diagnoses performed by dermatovenereologists in a central hospital in Lisbon, Portugal.
