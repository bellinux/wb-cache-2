25|$|Preparation is done, {{often by}} hand, to {{manufacture}} a tip radius sufficient to induce a <b>high</b> <b>electric</b> field, with radii {{on the order}} of 100nm.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} an {{electrostatic}} discharge to occur, two preconditions are necessary: firstly, a sufficiently <b>high</b> <b>electric</b> potential between two regions of space must exist, and secondly a high-resistance medium must obstruct the free, unimpeded equalization {{of the opposite}} charges.|$|E
25|$|As very <b>high</b> <b>electric</b> fields {{correspond}} to only tiny {{changes in the}} width of the crystal, this width can be changed with better-than-µm precision, making piezo crystals the most important tool for positioning objects with extreme accuracy— thus their use in actuators.|$|E

25|$|Fowler–Nordheim {{tunneling}} is the wave-mechanical tunneling {{of electrons}} through a rounded triangular barrier created {{at the surface}} of an electron conductor by applying a very <b>high</b> <b>electric</b> field. Individual electrons can escape by Fowler-Nordheim tunneling from many materials in various different circumstances.|$|E
25|$|In field ion {{microscopy}} the tip is cooled by {{a cryogen}} and its polarity is reversed. When an imaging gas (usually hydrogen or helium) is introduced at low pressures (< 0.1 Pascal) gas ions in the <b>high</b> <b>electric</b> {{field at the}} tip apex are field ionized and produce a projected image of protruding atoms at the tip apex. The image resolution is determined primarily by {{the temperature of the}} tip but even at 78 Kelvin atomic resolution is achieved.|$|E
25|$|Field ion {{microscopy}} is {{a modification}} of field emission microscopy where a stream of tunneling electrons is emitted from the apex of a sharp needle-like tip cathode when subjected to a sufficiently <b>high</b> <b>electric</b> field (~3-6V/nm). The needle is oriented towards a phosphor screen to create a projected image of the work function at the tip apex. The image resolution is limited to (2-2.5nm), due to quantum mechanical effects and lateral variations in the electron velocity.|$|E
30|$|Figure 9 a explores {{that the}} {{electric}} {{field on the}} curving part of the free surface was very heterogeneous and high, suggesting that those sites should be more efficient to self-generate jets. And {{the edge of the}} solution reservoir had much <b>higher</b> <b>electric</b> field intensity than the free surface due to metal materials of the reservoir. As shown in Fig. 2, a number of jets initiated around the curving part of free surface. And the <b>higher</b> <b>electric</b> field intensity around the edge rather than the surface could be the main reason that jets generated firstly {{from the edge of the}} solution reservoir. However, multiple jets were generated from the bubbles, as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 9 b reveals that the bubbles had lower electric field intensity than the curving part of the free surface. Since the electrostatic force was the main driving force to accelerate the movement of the jets, the jets would travel faster under a <b>higher</b> <b>electric</b> field. Therefore, the <b>higher</b> <b>electric</b> field on the curving part of the free surface than the bubbles could be the main reason that the generated bubbles would increase the nanofiber diameter and decrease the nanofiber production. The theoretical analysis results were in good agreement with the experimental results.|$|R

50|$|Stacking {{one or more}} thinner {{layers of}} {{amorphous}} silicon together with other materials to form a multijunction solar cell. The <b>higher</b> <b>electric</b> field which applies in the thinner layers appears to reduce the SWE.|$|R
25|$|Field {{emission}} in pure metals {{occurs in}} <b>high</b> <b>electric</b> fields: the gradients are typically higher than 1 gigavolt per metre and strongly {{dependent upon the}} work function. While electron sources based on field emission {{have a number of}} applications, field emission is most commonly an undesirable primary source of vacuum breakdown and electrical discharge phenomena, which engineers work to prevent. Examples of applications for surface field emission include construction of bright electron sources for high-resolution electron microscopes or the discharge of induced charges from spacecraft. Devices which eliminate induced charges are termed charge-neutralizers.|$|E
25|$|The {{combination}} of intrinsic (spin-transfer torque) and extrinsic (resistive switching) mechanisms naturally {{leads to a}} second-order memristive system described by the state vector x=(x1,x2), where x1 describes the magnetic state of the electrodes and x2 denotes the resistive state of the MgO barrier. In this case the change of x1 is current-controlled (spin torque {{is due to a}} high current density) whereas the change of x2 is voltage-controlled (the drift of oxygen vacancies is due to <b>high</b> <b>electric</b> fields). The presence of both effects in a memristive magnetic tunnel junction led {{to the idea of a}} nanoscopic synapse-neuron system.|$|E
25|$|Such {{magnetic}} fields may be advected inward from {{the interstellar medium}} or generated by a magnetic dynamo within the disk. Magnetic fields strengths at least of order 100 Gauss seem necessary for the magneto-centrifugal mechanism to launch powerful jets. There are problems, however, in carrying external magnetic flux inward towards the central star of the disk. <b>High</b> <b>electric</b> conductivity dictates that the magnetic field is frozen into the matter which is being accreted onto the central object with a slow velocity. However, the plasma is not a perfect electric conductor, so there is always some degree of dissipation. The magnetic field diffuses away faster than {{the rate at which}} it is being carried inward by accretion of matter.|$|E

50|$|QED {{predicts that}} when {{electrons}} get {{very close to}} each other, they behave {{as if they had}} a <b>higher</b> <b>electric</b> charge, due to vacuum polarization. This prediction was experimentally verified in 1997 using the TRISTAN particle accelerator in Japan.|$|R
50|$|Electric {{traction}} {{offers a}} lower cost per mile of train operation but at a higher initial cost, {{which can only be}} justified on high traffic lines. Since the cost per mile of construction is much <b>higher,</b> <b>electric</b> traction is less viable for long-distance lines with the exception of long-distance <b>high</b> speed lines. <b>Electric</b> trains receive their current via overhead lines or through a third rail electric system.|$|R
25|$|The {{immediate}} {{energy release}} per atom is about 180 million electron volts (MeV); i.e., 74 TJ/kg. Only 7% {{of this is}} gamma radiation and kinetic energy of fission neutrons. The remaining 93% is kinetic energy (or energy of motion) of the charged fission fragments, flying {{away from each other}} mutually repelled by the positive charge of their protons (38 for strontium, 54 for xenon). This initial kinetic energy is 67 TJ/kg, imparting an initial speed of about 12,000 kilometers per second. The charged fragments' <b>high</b> <b>electric</b> charge causes many inelastic collisions with nearby atoms, and these fragments remain trapped inside the bomb's uranium pit and tamper until their motion is converted into heat. This takes about a millionth of a second (a microsecond), by which time the core and tamper of the bomb have expanded to plasma several meters in diameter with a temperature of tens of millions of degrees Celsius.|$|E
25|$|In 1878, Edison {{began working}} on a system of {{electrical}} illumination, something he hoped could compete with gas and oil based lighting. He began by tackling the problem of creating a long-lasting incandescent lamp, {{something that would be}} needed for indoor use. Many earlier inventors had previously devised incandescent lamps, including Alessandro Volta's demonstration of a glowing wire in 1800 and inventions by Henry Woodward and Mathew Evans. Others who developed early and commercially impractical incandescent electric lamps included Humphry Davy, James Bowman Lindsay, Moses G. Farmer, William E. Sawyer, Joseph Swan, and Heinrich Göbel. Some of these early bulbs had such flaws as an extremely short life, high expense to produce, and <b>high</b> <b>electric</b> current drawn, making them difficult to apply on a large scale commercially. Edison realized that to connect a series of electric lights to an economically manageable size and using the necessary thickness of copper wire, he would have to develop a lamp that used a low amount of current. This lamp must have high resistance and use relatively low voltage (around 110 volts).|$|E
500|$|The high {{sublimation}} {{temperature of}} SiC (approximately 2700°C) makes it useful for bearings and furnace parts. Silicon carbide does not melt at any known temperature. It is also highly inert chemically. There is currently {{much interest in}} its use as a semiconductor material in electronics, where its high thermal conductivity, <b>high</b> <b>electric</b> field breakdown strength and high maximum current density make it more promising than silicon for high-powered devices. SiC also has a very low {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (4.0 [...] 10−6/K) and experiences no phase transitions that would cause discontinuities in thermal expansion.|$|E

500|$|Bird {{used his}} {{position}} {{as head of the}} department of electricity and galvanism to further his research efforts and to aid him in teaching his students. [...] He was interested in electrolysis and repeated the experiments of Antoine César Becquerel, Edmund Davy and others to extract metals in this way. [...] He was particularly interested in the possibility of detecting low levels of heavy metal poisons with this technique, pioneered by Davy. [...] Bird also studied the properties of albumen under electrolysis, finding that the albumen coagulated at the anode because hydrochloric acid was produced there. [...] He corrected an earlier erroneous conclusion by W. T. Brande that <b>high</b> <b>electric</b> current caused coagulation at the cathode also, showing that this was entirely due to fluid flows caused by the strong electric field.|$|E
500|$|In {{developing}} the Budd-Michelin railcar, the Budd Company used the formed steel technology {{in which they}} were industry pioneers and solved the most difficult problem in using stainless steel for railcar construction: developing a welding technique that would not compromise the strength and corrosion resistance of the stainless steel. On August 20, 1932, Earl J. Ragsdale, an engineer at the Budd Company, filed a patent application for a [...] "Method and product of electric welding"; on January 16, 1934, the United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) granted US patent 1,944,106 to the Budd Company. Shotwelding, as Ragsdale termed his method, involved automatic control of the timing of individual spot welds. [...] In spot welding, the two pieces of metal that are to be joined are pressed together with an electrode {{on each side of the}} joint. A very <b>high</b> <b>electric</b> current is passed through the joint and fuses the two pieces of metal together. If a spot weld is heated too long, heat will spread from the weld at a middling temperature that weakens the stainless steel and compromises its corrosion-resistant properties unacceptably; Ragsdale's precisely-timed welds solved the problem. With their patented welding process at the core of stainless steel railcar construction, the cars produced by Budd were a truly unique product.|$|E

40|$|For {{monochromatic}} solutions of D'Alembert's {{wave equation}} and Maxwell's equations, we obtain sharp bounds on the sup norm {{as a function}} of the far field energy. The extremizer in the scalar case is radial. In the case of Maxwell's equation, the electric field maximizing the value at the origin follows longitude lines on the sphere at infinity. In dimension d= 3 the <b>highest</b> <b>electric</b> field for Maxwell's equation is smaller by a factor 2 / 3 than the highest corresponding scalar waves. The <b>highest</b> <b>electric</b> field densities on the balls B_R(0) occur as R→ 0. The density dips to half max at R approximately equal to one third the wavelength. The extremizing fields are identical to those that attain the maximum field intensity at the origin. Comment: 30 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to being less efficient, operating LEDs at <b>higher</b> <b>electric</b> currents creates <b>higher</b> heat levels, which compromise LED lifetime. Because of this increased heat at higher currents, high-brightness LEDs have an industry standard of operating at only 350 mA, which is a compromise between light output, efficiency, and longevity.|$|R
50|$|Geiger-Müller {{counters}} use an even <b>higher</b> <b>electric</b> field so that UV-photons are created. These start new avalanches, eventually {{resulting in}} a total ionization of the gas around the anode wire. This makes the signal very strong, but causes a dead time after each event and makes it impossible to measure the X-ray energies.|$|R
