25|$|I am {{extremely}} {{disappointed with}} the overall picture of Test play, which {{was not the kind}} of cricket I want to watch. People who pay to see a Test are entitled to see a real match, not a tactical tie-up. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> fair result that neither England or Australia won the series. I can't get out of my head why Test matches are so different from State matches, where I think England played pretty well. It is all so different from what we visualised. After all this talk of brighter cricket I think we should get back to playing cricket. Perhaps a little more action and less talk.|$|E

And I think therefore taking all those circumstances in view... I think it is quite conceivable that they did go for the summit... I certainly would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> lovely thought and I think it is something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, I think that is something one just cannot know.|$|E
500|$|The {{urgency of}} {{negotiating}} a concession {{was made clear}} to Rhodes {{during a visit to}} London in June 1888, when he learned of the London syndicate's letter to Knutsford, and of their appointment of Maund. Rhodes now understood that the Matabeleland concession could still go elsewhere if he did not secure the document quickly. [...] "Someone has to get the country, and I think we should have the best chance," [...] Rhodes told Rothschild; [...] "I have always been afraid of the difficulty of dealing with the Matabele king. He is the only block to central Africa, as, once we have his territory, the rest is easy... the rest is simply a village system with separate headmen... I have faith in the country, and Africa is on the move. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> second Cinderella." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his book}} Marketing Communication, Richard J. Varey used the product range {{as an example}} of a company capitalising on a form of product {{placement}} or [...] "stealth advertising", writing that [...] "Viewers don't realize that they are, in effect, watching an advertisement". Betty Driver said of the range's launch: [...] "Betty Turpin's hotpots have become something of an institution at the Rover's and she's very proud of her reputation for good, wholesome food. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> lovely idea that people will be able to buy them in supermarkets now." [...] Driver discussed her astonishment at the general level of interest in her character's hotpots, disclosing: [...] "I was on a cruise on the QE2 a few weeks ago, and everyone was asking me about it. Then one day, they served hot pot on the menu and everyone thought it was mine!" ...|$|E
500|$|Kim Manners called [...] "Grotesque" [...] his {{favorite}} third-season episode and praised David Duchovny's performance on this episode, saying [...] "Duchovny drove himself, {{and he was}} brilliant in that show." [...] Manners also said of the episode: [...] "I think 'Grotesque' is a frightening show. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> disturbing show, and I think that's why—for me—it's such a good show. We pulled it off making the viewer feel uneasy. I even found it a difficult show to watch. Yeah, {{it was a pretty}} dark hour of television and I would like to do more of those." [...] In order to get a proper feel for the episode, Manners listened to the music from the 1990 film Jacob's Ladder until his wife [...] "finally asked, 'Do we have to listen to that (bleeping) CD again?'" [...] Manners also theorized that the episode may have been the template for the show Millennium, which premiered on Fox the following television season.|$|E
500|$|In the World Championship, O'Sullivan {{defeated}} Craig Steadman 10–3 in {{the first}} round and Matthew Stevens 13–5 in the second round, but suffered a surprise 9–13 defeat to Stuart Bingham in the quarter-finals. O'Sullivan was involved in many incidents during the tournament. While playing Steadman, he breached snooker's dress code when he removed a pair of uncomfortable shoes and played briefly in his socks, before borrowing shoes from tournament director Mike Ganley. In his match with Stevens, frustrated at missing a shot, he almost snapped his cue in half by hitting it against the table. In his quarter-final match, O'Sullivan placed his chalk on the table and used it to line up a shot. Controversially, referee Terry Camilleri did not penalize him for the incident, even though many commentators, including former world champion Ken Doherty and former tour referee Michaela Tabb, argued that under the rules of snooker the referee should have called a 7-point foul. These incidents led Stephen Hendry to say that O'Sullivan was not fully focused. [...] "Personally <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> sign he has got other things on his mind," [...] said Hendry. [...] "He is not focused properly on winning the World Championship." ...|$|E

500|$|X Japan are {{considered}} {{one of the founders of}} visual kei, a movement among Japanese musicians comparable to Western glam, with the name itself believed to have been derived from their slogan [...] "Psychedelic Violence Crime of Visual Shock". In 2011, Yoshiki briefly described their early years and the movement's development, saying [...] "when we started the band, the problem was we didn’t belong anywhere. Because we were playing very heavy music, we were wearing tons of make-up and crazy outfits. So we couldn’t belong anywhere", [...] " [...] that eventually became visual kei." [...] He added [...] "But visual kei is more like a spirit, it’s not a music style or, you know... <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> freedom about describing myself, a freedom to express myself, that’s what I believe visual kei is." [...] Upon former guitarist hide's death in 1998, less than a year after the band broke up, Billboards Steve McClure declared it [...] "the end of an era", explaining [...] "X were the first generation of visual kei bands For the next generation of bands, it's like: That's it. The torch has been passed to us." ...|$|E
500|$|Aston saw Time Team as an {{extension}} of his work as an extramural tutor, telling a 2013 interviewer that it was [...] "a way of reaching 3 million people rather than 30 people in the village hall." [...] Commenting on the popularity of Time Team, and its role in exposing the British public to archaeology, in a 2010 interview Aston remarked that [...] "My motive was to get {{as many people as possible}} interested in archaeology, because we [...] all enjoy it and think it interesting. That was my personal aim... and on that basis <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> success." [...] Time Team encouraged wider public interest in archaeology and led to increasing numbers of students applying to study archaeological courses at British universities, while subscriptions to Current Archaeology magazine quadrupled to 18,000 in the show's first five years. In autumn 1998, Channel 4 started a Time Team fan club, which had 16,000 members within a few months, while Aston became a supporter of the Council for British Archaeology's Young Archaeologists' Club (YAC), and with Harding gave regular talks to YAC branches. Aston found himself giving up to 20 public lectures a year on the subject of Time Team, describing the public feedback as [...] "embarrassingly encouraging".|$|E

He said, in a statement to the club's official website, [...] "I am very excited to come to a club like Chelsea, it is a big club and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> dream for every player.

2500|$|Thomas spoke favorably {{about the}} concept of stare decisis, or {{standing}} by precedent, during his confirmation hearings, stating that [...] "stare decisis provides continuity to our system, it provides predictability, and in our process of case-by-case decision making, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> very important and critical concept." [...] However, according to Antonin Scalia, Thomas [...] "doesn't believe in stare decisis, period." [...] This assessment is consistent with Thomas's record on the bench: factoring in length of tenure, Thomas urged overruling and joined in overruling precedents more frequently than any other justice during the Rehnquist Court.|$|E

2500|$|Like a Prayer {{was named}} after the {{influence}} of Catholicism on Madonna's early {{life as well as}} her struggles with religion; [...] "The theme of Catholicism runs rampant", she said. [...] "It's me struggling with the mystery and magic that surrounds it. My own Catholicism is in constant upheaval." [...] Recording sessions took place from September 1988 to January 1989. On January 27, 1989, a press release from The Albany Herald said the album would include [...] "a number of hot dance tracks" [...] but noted, [...] "much of the material [...] is of a personal tone." [...] The singer described it as a collection of songs [...] "about my mother, my father, and bonds with my family. [...] It's taken a lot of guts to do this". She also said that it would be her [...] "most different" [...] work to date; [...] "It was a real coming-of-age record for me emotionally, I had {{to do a lot of}} soul-searching, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> reflection of that [...] I didn't try to candy-coat anything or make it more palatable for mass consumption, I wrote what I felt". She told Rolling Stone magazine [...] "In the past, my records tended to be a reflection of current influences. This album is more about past musical influences". She chose to collaborate with Stephen Bray and Patrick Leonard, with whom she had collaborated on her previous studio album True Blue (1986) and the soundtrack Who's That Girl (1987). Both Bray and Leonard wanted to bring their unique style to the project, and they developed completely different music for the title track. Eventually, Madonna felt that the music presented to her by Leonard was more interesting, and she started to work with him. According to the singer, Leonard was also facing emotional turmoil; [...] "I was working with Pat, who was also in a very dark state of mind, and we worked in a very isolated place in the Valley". On January 6, 1989, following a nullified divorce filing in late 1987 and several publicized fights, one of which led to a 60-day prison term, Madonna and Sean Penn filed for divorce. [...] This incident inspired the song [...] "Till Death Do Us Part". The rest of the songs were written within two weeks; with [...] "Like a Prayer", [...] "Cherish" [...] and [...] "Spanish Eyes" [...] being written the first week. According to Leonard, [...] "we wrote a song a day, and we didn't change them. And oftentimes the vocal that she did was the lead vocal, we didn't even change the lead vocal. That was it. She sang it. It was done".|$|E
