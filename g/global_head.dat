5|$|Executives from Endemol, the {{production}} company for Big Brother worldwide, defended the format which is transmitted in 41 territories and noted the season {{premiere of the}} 11th season in America won its timeslot with year-to-year growth.

Paul Jonson, <b>global</b> <b>head</b> of marketing and brand partnerships for Endemol Group, noted that using audience averages to figure out how the show performs wouldn't work since the audience builds up until the finale.

5|$|Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske wanted {{reassurance}} {{that the character}} would not fail. The <b>global</b> <b>head</b> of marketing, Al Nilsen, became involved, and playtested the game across the United States with Mario fans: they were shown Mario and then played Sonic the Hedgehog. 80 percent preferred Sonic the Hedgehog, and the game was shown at the 1991 Summer Consumer Electronics Show. The game was released in North America on June 23, 1991, and in the PAL regions and Japan the following month. Sega of America packaged it with American Genesis consoles, replacing Altered Beast. This tactic enabled Sega of America to sell 15 million Genesis units. Genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of Sonic the Hedgehog by mail. Sega of America created a large-scale marketing campaign to promote the game and Sonic as a mascot for the company.|$|E
5|$|Capcom's design {{philosophy}} for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was {{to maximize}} gameplay depth and minimize complexity. According to Niitsuma, the development team sought {{to create a}} game that would reach out to longtime fans of the series, while simultaneously expanding their user base to those familiar with the characters, but perhaps not with fighting games in general. The urge {{to reach out to}} new players also stemmed from Marvel's recent success in the Hollywood film industry. Capcom's <b>global</b> <b>head</b> of production, Keiji Inafune, expressed interest in appealing to a worldwide audience. These ideas drove the decision to retool the fighting system, which was criticized in past iterations for being too complicated for casual players. These changes include the implementation of the three-button attack system from Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and the addition of Simple Mode. Unlike previous titles in the series, Capcom had no plans for an arcade release, and focused only on console versions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. When asked if Capcom was planning to release the game on other consoles, Niitsuma did not dismiss the possibility for a Nintendo Wii version; however, this ultimately did not come to fruition.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we {{complete}} {{the analysis of}} Vicsek’s model of distributed coordination among kinematic planar agents. The model is a simple discrete time heading update rule {{for a set of}} kinematic agents (or self-propelled particles as referred to by Vicsek) moving in a finite plane with periodic boundary conditions. Contrary to existing results in the literature, we do not make any assumptions on connectivity but instead prove that under the update scheme, the network of agents stays jointly connected infinitely often for almost all initial conditions, resulting in <b>global</b> <b>heading</b> alignment. Our main result is derived using a famous theorem of Hermann Weyl on equidistribution of fractional parts of sequences. We also show that the Vicsek update scheme is closely related to the Kuramoto model of coupled nonlinear oscillators. I...|$|R

40|$|This thesis investigates and {{implements}} {{the sensor}} fusion necessary to autonomously reverse a full size truck and trailer system.

It is shown that the relative angles between truck-dolly and dolly-trailer can be estimated, along with global position and <b>global</b> <b>heading</b> of the trailer. This is then implemented in one of Scania's test vehicles, giving it the ability to continuously estimate these states. A controller is then implemented, showing that the full scale system can be stabilised in reverse motion. The controller is tested both on a static reference path and a reference path received from a motion planner. In these tests, the controller is able to stabilise the system well, allowing the truck to do complex manoeuvres backwards. A small lateral tracking error is present, which needs to be further investigated...|$|R

40|$|Image geo-localization is an {{important}} problem with many applica-tions such as augmented reality and navigation. The most common ways to geo-localize an image are to use its meta-data such as GPS or to match it against a geo-tagged database. When neither of those is available, {{it is still possible}} to apply shadow analysis to determine the camera heading for outdoor images. This could be useful prun-ing the search space in geo-localization applications, for example by removing roads with incompatible orientations from a database such as Open Street Map. In this paper, we develop a novel interactive method for deducing the <b>global</b> <b>heading</b> of a query image using the shadows in it. We start by constructing a model of the sun-earth system to determine all shadows possible at a given approximate lat-itude, and compare shadows within the query to those possible under the model to determine the range of possible headings. We demon-strate this on 54 query images with known ground truth, and show that in 52 cases the ground truth lies in the computed range. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of smartphones and their embedded sensors motivates research toward {{the development of}} handheld device based navigation solutions especially for harsh environments. In this context, Pedestrian Dead Reckoning is usually adopted to compute the pedestrian's trajectory. Step/stride lengths and walking directions are combined in a recursive process. Unfortunately the estimated path suffers from drifting errors due to the sensors' nature and the motion complexity. To reduce this error, map matching strategies are studied and several solutions are proposed in the literature. In this work a Matching Filter is proposed to mitigate the drifting errors. The Matching Filter is a nest filter based on an extended Kalman Filter and a Complementary filter. The key idea is to match the PDR trajectory with the standalone GPS trajectory during opportune phases in order to estimate a <b>global</b> <b>heading</b> and scale factor errors on the PDR path. The proposed strategy is tested with a 1 km walk in a shopping center. A 75 % improvement is found {{as compared to the}} PDR only trajectory...|$|R
