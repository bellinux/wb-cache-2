40|$|The silk braids which adorn some banners in the HoryOji and Shosoin {{collections}} {{represent the}} four basic types of braids from {{the seventh and}} eighth centulfies in japan (Fig. 1). a the four, type 1. the square braid, is found primarily as hanging cord. Type II. the four-ridge flat braid with a twill pattern, was used as trimming around design figures. l) Types III and IV, the oblique ribbed twine braid and the braid with a plain-weave pattern respectively, are flat and generally wider than the first two types. They compose the "head, " "tongue, " and "arms " of some banners, giving a necessary firmness {{to the shape of}} the banners (Fig. 2). Narrow braids of Type III were occasionally used as <b>edge</b> <b>trimmings.</b> To my knowledge, no banner adorned with braids from later era has yet been found. Some braids in the HoryOji collection have been attributed to be of Chinese origin. L) It has been generally understood that braiding techniques were also brought to japan by Koreans in the sixth century. I have not yet had a chance to trace the japanese braiding techniques back to their origin...|$|E
30|$|This {{large amount}} of wasted wood is often used in the steam {{production}} boiler for drying wood products, or is dumped in a site (Eshun et al. 2012). These practices contribute to environmental impacts through wood waste {{and at the same}} time lead to depletion of timber resources. Eshun et al. (2012) have identified 19 wood waste sources in Ghana, out of them 3 related to the forestry sub system and 16 to the timber industry subsystem. Major sources of wood waste were low quality logs with large defects, bark, off-cuts, sawdust, slabs, and <b>edged</b> <b>trimmings</b> from sawn timber. There are new technologies for the utilization of low quality logs which can significantly reduce the wood wastage as well as specialized equipment which enables to maximize the wood recovery. However, in many enterprises, particularly in developing countries, these new production methods have not yet been used. Therefore, the major causes of wood wastage can be broadly classified into technology-based factors such as the use of obsolete equipment and inefficient procedures and production methods, management-based operational practices, and administrative and institutional issues.|$|R
5000|$|Vessels {{were made}} of woodâ€”typically ranging in length from 40 to nearly 300 ft in length, 10 to 80 ft wide, drawing only about one to five feet of water loaded, and {{in fact it was}} {{commonly}} said that they could [...] "navigate on a heavy dew." [...] The boats had kingposts or internal masts to support hogchains, or iron trusses, which prevented the hull from sagging. A second deck was added, the Texas Deck, to provide cabins and passenger areas. All was built from wood. Stairs, galleys, parlors were also added. Often the boats became quite ornate with wood trim, velvet, plush chairs, gilt <b>edging</b> and other <b>trimmings</b> sometimes featured as per the owner's taste and budget. Wood burning boilers were forward center to distribute weight. The engines were also amidships, or at the stern depending on if the vessel was a sternwheeler or sidewheeler. Two rudders were fitted to help steer the ship.|$|R
