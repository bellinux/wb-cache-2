5|$|Monteverdi's letters {{during the}} 1618–20 period, mainly to Striggio but {{occasionally}} to Don Vincenzo or Marigliani, offer various excuses for {{his lack of}} progress on Andromeda, including his duties at St Mark's, his health, and his obligations to provide ceremonial music for the Doge (ruler) of Venice. In February 1619, Monteverdi had started work on another Mantuan project, a ballo (dance with sung parts) to Striggio's libretto entitled Apollo. On 9 January 1620, still with 400 lines of the Andromeda libretto to set to music, Monteverdi proposed to Striggio that the entire opera project be abandoned and the ballo substituted. This idea was rapidly quashed; Don Vincenzo ordered that the remaining Andromeda music be sent to him <b>forthwith.</b> The final segment of Andromeda, an eight-part song, was delivered to Marigliani on 15 February 1620.|$|E
5|$|The Admiralty {{ordered that}} the troops, but not their equipment, be {{unloaded}} from the cruisers {{on the evening}} of the 8th, and that the cruisers were to search <b>forthwith</b> for the German ships known to be at sea. This was later cancelled and the squadron was ordered to rendezvous with {{the main body of the}} Home Fleet. Later that day, German bombers attacked the British ships and Devonshire suffered a near-miss. On the 11th, the squadron was detached on an unsuccessful search for German ships in the area around Trondheim and rejoined the fleet two days later. Cunningham's ships were then detached to Tromsø where he conducted negotiations with local officials to refuel there and to bring Norwegian troops west from Kirkenes. The squadron arrived there on the afternoon of the 15th and escorted Norwegian troopships back to Tromsø. Devonshire covered the evacuation of British and French troops from Namsos at the beginning of May and was nearly hit when the evacuation forces were attacked by German aircraft as they were withdrawing on 3 May.|$|E
5|$|The {{settlers}} {{were discovered}} in early May 1823 by the Mexican Eagle, a schooner from British Honduras carrying the Chief Magistrate of Belize, Marshal Bennet, to the Mosquito king's court. Seven men and three children had died, and many more were sick. Bennet informed them that Poyais did not exist {{and that he had}} never heard of this Cazique they spoke of. He advised them to return with him to British Honduras, as they would surely die if they stayed where they were. The majority preferred to wait for Hall to come back, hopefully with news of passage back to Britain. About half a week later Hall returned with the Mosquito king, who announced that MacGregor's land grant was revoked <b>forthwith.</b> He had never granted MacGregor the title of Cazique, he said, nor given him the right to sell land or raise loans against it; the emigrants were in fact in George Frederic Augustus's territory illegally and would have to leave unless they pledged allegiance to him. All the settlers left except for about 40 who were too weakened by disease to make the journey.|$|E
5|$|Hanley council made {{a formal}} {{proposal}} in 1902 to the Local Government Board {{for the expansion}} of the County Borough of Hanley to include not only Stoke, Burslem, Longton, Fenton and Tunstall but also Smallthorne Urban District, Wolstanton Rural District, and the parishes of Milton, Goldenhill, Chell, Trentham, Stoke Rural, Caverswall and Stone. Only Longton council supported the idea as concurrently, Sir Hugh Owen, a former secretary to the Local Government Board, presented the six towns committee with a scheme of financial adjustment. Under this proposal, the net assets of each town would be calculated by deducting outstanding debts and liabilities from the values of its various properties. The proportion each town needed to contribute to the overall value of the county borough was then to be calculated. If the value of the net assets to be contributed by a town was less than the proportion calculated as due from that town towards the overall sum, then that town would need to set a higher general rate to be paid by the ratepayers of that town. Conversely, towns contributing a value of net assets greater than their proportion of the overall sum would be able to set a lower general rate. While five of the towns awaited a report from Alderman Frederick Geen of Stoke on the implications of the Owen proposal, Fenton immediately decided that it would impose undue financial hardship on the ratepayers of the district as the net assets of the district would show a deficiency and therefore a higher rate would have to be set. Fenton district council could not accept such a move and withdrew from all discussions on federation <b>forthwith.</b> Geen's July 1903 report increased opposition to the idea of federation while a poll of ratepayers in Burslem came out strongly against federation. Burslem council then withdrew from the scheme to be followed shortly afterwards by Stoke. Faced by such strong opposition, Hanley council felt compelled to withdraw its submission to the Local Government Board bringing the first attempt at federation in the twentieth century to an unsuccessful conclusion.|$|E

25|$|In May 2005, when {{addressing}} the Oireachtas Justice Committee, {{he made a}} number of comments insinuating that most asylum seekers were not legally entitled to stay in Ireland and regretting his inability to deport them <b>forthwith</b> because of due process.|$|E
25|$|Section 34(2) {{provides}} that, {{as soon as}} {{a notice}} is published in terms of section 34(1), every liquidated liability of the trader in connection with his business which would become due at some future date, falls due <b>forthwith,</b> if the creditor concerned demands payment.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to serving Charles as singer and composer, Busnois accompanied the Duke on his military campaigns, as did Hayne van Ghizeghem. Busnois {{was at the}} siege of Neuss in Germany in 1475, and survived (or missed) the disastrous Battle of Nancy in 1477 at which Charles was killed and Burgundian expansion was ended <b>forthwith</b> and forever.|$|E

25|$|In April 1968 a lorry {{collided}} with a low road bridge under the line at Horsebridge north of Hailsham damaging the bridge causing immediate closure of the line. As the freight train service between Hailsham and Heathfield was due to be withdrawn the following month it was not considered worthwhile repairing the bridge so the line was prematurely abandoned <b>forthwith.</b> Some wagons isolated at Heathfield goods yard were cut up on site.|$|E
25|$|The Division HQ, Division {{troops and}} 5 SA Infantry Brigade arrived in Suez, after an eleven-day voyage from Mombassa on 3 May 1941. The 2nd Brigade arrived in Suez on 8 June from Berbera and was <b>forthwith</b> assiged to 2 SA Infantry Division. The 1st Brigade sailed from Massawa on 12 June 1941 to Egypt. At {{the peak of}} {{operations}} in 1940, there were 77,000 troops in Kenya of which 27,000 were South African.|$|E
25|$|It was a set-up. The {{two other}} Board members cried off with feeble excuses and I {{had to sit}} alone in judgment. I heard the case; found Chappell guilty as charged, and {{suspended}} him <b>forthwith</b> {{for a period of}} six weeks. I sent my report to the Board who did not back me up. Chappell's sentence was suspended. I had no other course of action than to see the season through and not re-nominate again.|$|E
25|$|Reciprocal {{engagement}} that {{in case it}} {{is found}} necessary to send troops by Japan to Korea, or by Russia to Manchuria, for the purpose either of protecting the interests mentioned in article II of this agreement, or of suppressing insurrection or disorder calculated to create international complications, the troops so sent are in no case to exceed the actual number required and are to be <b>forthwith</b> recalled as soon as their missions are accomplished.|$|E
25|$|On September 8, 2007, Veterinary {{officials}} in South Cotabato, Philippines said that laboratory tests on samples from cows, carabaos, and {{horses in the}} province's 10 towns and lone city showed the level of infection at 89.5%, a sudden increase of positive cases among large livestock due to the erratic weather condition in the area. They must be treated <b>forthwith</b> to prevent complications with surra and hemorrhagic septicemia diseases. Surra already affected all barangays of the Surallah town.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, many Acts {{passed by}} the Governor General during this period were not {{relevant}} to the Straits Settlements, and {{it was difficult to}} determine which were applicable. The situation was remedied by the passing of the Statute Law Revision Ordinance 1889 (No. 8 of 1889) (Ind.), which appointed commissioners to inquire into the matter and empowered them to publish a volume containing the text of any Indian Acts considered in force. Any Acts not included ceased to be applicable <b>forthwith.</b>|$|E
25|$|St Cyprian, Bishop of Carthage, {{notes that}} Roman {{authorities}} {{had established a}} norm according to which all Christians who had been denounced must be executed and their goods confiscated by the Imperial treasury. At the beginning of August 258, the Emperor Valerian issued an edict that all bishops, priests, and deacons should immediately be put to death. Pope St Sixtus II was captured on 6 August 258, at the cemetery of St Callixtus while celebrating the liturgy and executed <b>forthwith.</b>|$|E
25|$|Philippines. On 23 August 2007, RWB {{condemned}} the continuing threats and violence against Philippine radio commentators who report on organized crime and corruption, following a death threat on RGMA Palawan station manager Lily Uy. On 27 December 2007, RWB appealed to Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo administration to <b>forthwith</b> arrest the killers of radio broadcaster Ferdinand Lintuan, 51, the fifth journalist killed in 2007 in the Philippines. As {{first president of}} the Davao Association of Sports Journalists he was murdered in Davao City on 24 December.|$|E
25|$|The Queen's subtle use {{of signals}} to her staff in certain social {{situations}} {{has been described}} by journalist Hugo Vickers and others. It is said that by twisting her wedding ring she signals that she is ready for the conversation or event to end <b>forthwith.</b> Alternately, placing her handbag onto the table at dinner means that she wants the event to end within the next five minutes and by setting it on the floor she indicates that she is not enjoying the conversation and wants a lady-in-waiting to assist immediately.|$|E
25|$|The aristocrats {{declared}} that the consular election was not valid on account of some fault in the auspices; and a letter was <b>forthwith</b> sent to the camp of the consuls, with orders to return to Rome. But, as all preparations had been made for a great battle against the Insubres on the Addua, the letter was left unopened until the battle was gained. Furius obeyed the command of the Senate, and laid down his office. His colleague continued the campaign and celebrated a triumph over the Gauls before laying down his command.|$|E
25|$|His first work of {{importance}} was the charming {{group of the}} Mother and Child, then The Kiss of Victory, followed by Perseus Arming (1883), produced directly {{under the influence of}} the Florentine masterpieces he had studied. Its success was great, and Lord Leighton <b>forthwith</b> commissioned Icarus, which was exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1884, along with a remarkable Study of a Head, and was received with general applause. Then followed The Enchanted Chair, which, along with many other works deemed by the artist incomplete or unworthy of his powers, was ultimately broken by the sculptors own hand.|$|E
25|$|While it {{may have}} come as a {{surprise}} to Rivers, the offer of a Cambridge lectureship had come about as part of a long process of evolution within the University's Natural Science Tripos. Earlier in 1893, Professor McKendrick, of Glasgow, had examined subject and reported unfavourably on the scant knowledge of the special senses displayed by the candidates; it was in reaction to this that Sir Michael Foster, who had seen the potential in this shy, retiring Bart's man, appointed Rivers as a lecturer and he became Fellow Commoner at St John's College <b>forthwith.</b> He was to become a Fellow of the College in 1902.|$|E
25|$|When Mar Ukba {{was about}} to die, he asked to see his charity accounts. Finding gifts worth 7,000 Sijan gold denarii {{recorded}} therein, he exclaimed that the provisions were scanty and the road was long, and he <b>forthwith</b> distributed half of his wealth to charity. The Gemara asked how Mar Ukba could have given away so much, when Rabbi Elai taught that when the Sanhedrin sat at Usha, it ordained that if a person wishes to give liberally the person should not give more than {{a fifth of the}} person's wealth. The Gemara explained that this limitation applies only during a person's lifetime, as the person might thereby be impoverished, but the limitation does not apply to gifts at death.|$|E
25|$|On {{account of}} {{disputes}} {{at the head}} office in Bantam with natives, the Chinese, and the English, the VOC desired a better central headquarters. Coen thus directed more of the company's trade through Jakarta, where it had established a factory in 1610. However, not trusting the native ruler, he decided in 1618 to convert the Dutch warehouses into a fort. While away on an expedition the English had taken control over the town. Coen managed to reconquer Jakarta in 1619 with fire destroying most of the town during the process. He rebuilt the city and fort, thus founded on its ruins the new Dutch town, which he <b>forthwith</b> proclaimed {{the capital of the}} Dutch East Indies. In 1621 the city was renamed Batavia. Coen preferred Nieuw Hoorn, after his hometown, but didn't get his way.|$|E
25|$|Detective Garda Campbell {{attempted}} {{to talk with}} John Carthy but, in his evidence, said Carthy replied with an expletive and a threat to blow his head off. This exchange {{was followed by a}} shot at the Garda car which was now unoccupied. In total, John Carthy fired six shots by the time Detective Garda Campbell rang Granard Garda station with a request that they contact Superintendent Michael Byrne, {{who was in charge of}} the Granard Sub-District. Byrne instructed them to contact Superintendent Joseph Shelly in Mullingar. Shelly assumed command of the incident and ordered that a party of armed Gardaí be sent from Athlone station <b>forthwith.</b> En route to Granard Garda Station, Superintendent Shelly had another discussion with Superintendent Byrne and requested that armed Gardaí from Longford also be sent to Abbeylara. By 18:30, then, following the discharge of shots, the damaging of an unmarked Garda car and the request for assistance, armed Gardaí and detectives from Athlone, Longford and Mullingar were sent to John Carthy's home in Abbeylara.|$|E
25|$|At about 3:00a.m. on the {{especially}} dark {{early morning}} of June 1, 1861, {{one of the}} Confederate pickets, Private A. B. Francis, ran into the town of Fairfax Court House shouting that the enemy was upon them. The other picket, B. F. Florence, had been captured. A few of the Prince William cavalry tried to form a battle line in the street while others ran for their horses. As the Union force arrived on the Falls Church Road, most of the Confederate cavalrymen fled, leaving four of the Prince William cavalrymen in the street to be taken prisoner. Captain Marr moved his men into a clover field west of the Methodist church {{where they had been}} camped, just off Little River Turnpike, and formed them into two battle lines. Fleeing Confederate cavalrymen from Prince William came upon them and in the dark, some of Marr's men fired at them, wounding one of their own cavalrymen in the process. The Rappahannock cavalrymen had few weapons and no ammunition so they also fled <b>forthwith</b> when the Union soldiers arrived.|$|E

25|$|Martin {{arrived at}} Naples on the {{afternoon}} of 19 August, with orders to capture, sink or burn any vessels carrying military stores and supplies he found there and 'to use his utmost to lay the said city in ashes, unless the King of the two Sicilies shall agree <b>forthwith</b> not only to withdraw his troops now acting in conjunction with those of the King of Spain in Italy, but to forbear from giving in future any assistance of what kind soever.' Martin sent his flag captain, Merrick de L'Angle, onshore to present the terms to the King, demanding that an answer be returned within half an hour. The small squadron was considerably more powerful than anything the Neapolitans could muster, and after calling an emergency council, the King and his ministers attempted to make conditions, sending a deputy back to Martin with de L'Angle. Martin instead stated that he was sent ‘as an officer to act, not a minister to treat’, and once more demanded the King comply with the demands. With no way of resisting, the Neapolitans confirmed their neutrality, and promised to withdraw their troops. His objective achieved, Martin weighed anchor at midnight, and sailed to rejoin Mathews at Hyères Bay.|$|E
500|$|In early October 1914, Kitchener {{sent for}} Trenchard and tasked him with {{providing}} a battle-worthy squadron <b>forthwith.</b> [...] The squadron {{was to be}} used to support land and naval forces seeking to prevent the German flanking manoeuvres during the Race to the Sea. [...] On 7 October, only 36 hours later, No. 6 Squadron flew to Belgium, the first of many additional squadrons to be provided.|$|E
500|$|More {{controversial}} was Herring's {{relief of}} Brigadier Arnold Potts and Blamey's of Major General Arthur Samuel Allen at Herring's urging. Herring {{acknowledged that the}} two men had faced a difficult task but felt that they were tired and that Brigadier Ivan Dougherty and Major General Vasey could do better. Supporters of Allen, who left school at age 14, saw this as the action of an autocratic elitist who [...] "ran his staff as he had controlled junior counsel in his barrister's chamber; they did his bidding, his way, or were <b>forthwith</b> dispensed with".|$|E
500|$|On 10 August, Eugene sent {{an urgent}} {{dispatch}} reporting {{that he was}} falling back to Donauwörth – [...] "The enemy have marched.

500|$|One {{major issue}} that Winthrop was {{involved}} in occurred in 1647, when a petition was submitted to the general court concerning the limitation of voting rights to freemen who had been formally admitted to a local church. Winthrop and the other magistrates rejected the appeal that [...] "civil liberty and freedom be <b>forthwith</b> granted to all truly English", and even fined and imprisoned the principal signers of the petition. [...] William Vassal and Robert Child, two of the signatories, pursued complaints against the Massachusetts government in England over this and other issues.|$|E
500|$|Strang, {{who once}} {{described}} himself as a [...] "cool philosopher" [...] and a freethinker, became a Baptist minister but left in February 1844 to join the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints. He quickly found favor with Joseph Smith, though they had known each other only a short time, and was baptized personally by him on February 25, 1844. [...] On March 3 of that year he was ordained an Elder by Joseph's brother Hyrum and sent <b>forthwith</b> at Smith's request to Wisconsin, to establish a Mormon stake at Voree. [...] Shortly after Strang's departure, Joseph Smith was murdered by an anti-Mormon mob in Carthage, Illinois.|$|E

500|$|On 16 and 17 October, the Senate, {{with the}} {{unanimous}} {{support of the}} Coalition majority, deferred the appropriation bills. The Coalition took the position that Kerr could dismiss Whitlam if the Government could not secure supply. Whitlam's former solicitor-general Bob Ellicott, now a Liberal member of the House, issued a legal opinion on 16 October stating that the Governor-General {{had the power to}} dismiss Whitlam, and should do so <b>forthwith</b> if Whitlam could not state how he would obtain supply.
