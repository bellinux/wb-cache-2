25|$|A {{ball that}} bounces {{a little way}} before the good length and rises to the batsman's abdomen {{is said to be}} short pitched or {{described}} as a long hop and is easier for a batsman to hit as he will have had more time to see if the height or line of the ball has deviated after bouncing. A short-pitched ball is also at a more suitable height for the batsman to play an attacking pull shot. A ball that bounces significantly before the good length and reaches shoulder or head height is a bouncer and can be an <b>effective</b> <b>delivery.</b> Any ball short enough to bounce over the batsman's head is usually called wide by the Umpire. Bowling short pitched or wide balls is a bad idea as they are relatively easy for the batsman to defend or attack.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This study seek {{to examine}} the impact of {{facilities}} and equipment as predicting <b>effective</b> health care <b>delivery</b> in selected state government hospitals in Oyo State. Four hypothese were formulated and tested at 0. 05 alpha level. A total of 1, 220 respondents were randomly selected for the study. The instruments for the study were a structured questionnaire on facilities and equipment as predictors of <b>effective</b> health care <b>delivery</b> service and checklist of items on Infrastructure and equipment. The results from the study indicated that facilities, Equipment and Adequacy of facilities and Equipment were statistically significant and predict <b>effective</b> health care <b>delivery</b> service while Availability of facilities and equipment was found not to be significant and could not predict <b>effective</b> health care <b>delivery</b> services. The implication from this finding shows that facilities, equipment and adequacy of facilities and equipment actually predicted <b>effective</b> health care <b>delivery</b> service while availability of facilities and equipment did not predict <b>effective</b> health care <b>delivery</b> services...|$|R

500|$|As a bowler, Crawford's {{technique}} was also orthodox, {{although he was}} unusual in using his second and third fingers to spin the ball—most bowlers used their first and second. His bowling pace varied from fast to medium, and he spun the ball so much that his fingers snapped audibly as he released it. An accurate bowler, {{it was difficult for}} batsmen to score runs against him. Crawford could swing the ball away from the bat, but his most <b>effective</b> <b>delivery</b> was his off break: Clem Hill stated that Crawford could make the ball turn several inches, despite the hard pitches prevalent in Australia when he played there. John Arlott described him as [...] "the schoolboy genius who turned on Australian pitches where no one else deviated from straight". In 1937, Herbie Collins wrote, at a time when Wally Hammond was considered to be the world's leading all-rounder, that [...] "people who have seen both men consider [...] a better all-rounder".|$|E
500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Antigua, Ambrose practised intensely, regained {{his place in the}} Leeward Islands team and, in the absence of leading bowlers Winston Benjamin and Eldine Baptiste with the West Indies team, became the main attacking bowler in the side. He was no-balled for {{throwing}} in the first match, which Wisden Cricketers' Almanack later attributed to confusion caused by his attribute of flicking his wrist prior to releasing the ball to impart extra pace, and there were no subsequent doubts about the legality of his bowling action. Retaining his place when the international bowlers returned, he took 35 wickets—including 12 in a match against Guyana, of which nine were bowled—in five matches in the competition. Wisden's report on the West Indian season said his performance was [...] "dominant", although few had heard of him previously. Identifying his yorker as his most <b>effective</b> <b>delivery,</b> it noted that he [...] "never lost his pace, his accuracy, or his thirst for wickets".|$|E
500|$|Critics {{praised the}} cast for their hamming and <b>effective</b> <b>delivery</b> of what Bennion called the [...] "stilted, stagy dialogue"; Toby Dantzic, writing for The Telegraph Saturday Review, called the acting [...] "stellar". The {{attention}} to detail by {{the cast and crew}} was widely praised; the [...] "dated styling" [...] was, for Jackson, [...] "spot on". Louisa Mellor, of the entertainment website Den of Geek, explained that [...] "from the aspect ratio to the music, title font, sets, lighting, camera moves, hair, make-up and costume... everything was recognisable from the sort of 1970s television plays that, when you think about it, may have provided inspiration for Inside No. 9 as a whole". For her, [...] "the retro send-up provided enough entertainment on its own—these days {{you have to be very}} good to make TV that bad". White, similarly, argued that [...] "it's a gargantuan, incredibly precise task to make such gloriously terrible TV, a skill reserved for only the greatest of comics". Even despite the flaws of the film within the episode, Rebecca Nicholson, of theguardian.com, found it [...] "relatively gripping". Sarah Hughes, writing in i, compared [...] "The Devil of Christmas" [...] to an episode of Tales of the Unexpected; it was she, argued, [...] "both an immaculately conceived homage to Roald Dahl's original anthology series and a worthy contender for its crown".|$|E

500|$|As a bowler, Verity {{delivered}} {{the ball at}} almost medium pace, faster than usual for a spinner. R. C. Robertson-Glasgow, a cricket writer and journalist, wrote [...] "He is a scholarly bowler... He is tall, and much stronger than his pace needs. His run up, longer than most of his kind, has a measured delicacy that you would expect from this fastidious and nearly prim craftsman. Only his delivery has a grace which mathematics can't explain." [...] His main asset as a bowler was an ability to bowl straight and with great accuracy, on a good length. He could also make the ball bounce sharply. His most <b>effective</b> <b>delivery</b> [...] curved through the air, pitched on middle and leg stump and spun away from the batsman, causing many of them to edge {{the ball into the}} slips. On [...] rain-affected pitches he bowled more slowly, and was almost unplayable at times. However, the period in which Verity played was notable for good batting pitches, and batsmen often dominated. In these conditions, Verity prevented batsmen scoring runs and constantly tried new strategies to try to take wickets. Verity also used different types of delivery to keep batsmen uncertain: he could bowl at a slower and faster pace to his normal style and occasionally bowled a much faster ball which regularly took wickets.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the latter}} stages of an innings {{in one day}} cricket, batters seek to attack every ball bowled. [...] In such circumstances, the yorker is a {{particularly}} <b>effective</b> <b>delivery,</b> both in taking wickets and preventing boundaries from being hit. [...] Therefore, the yorker is very frequently bowled in these circumstances, and bowlers who can bowl yorkers accurately are prized in this form of cricket.|$|E
2500|$|Worldwide, {{non-compliance}} is a {{major obstacle}} to the <b>effective</b> <b>delivery</b> of health care. Estimates from the World Health Organization (2003) indicate that only about 50% of patients with chronic diseases living in developed countries follow treatment recommendations. In particular, low rates of adherence to therapies for asthma, diabetes, and hypertension are thought to contribute substantially to the human and economic burden of those conditions. Compliance rates may be overestimated in the medical literature, as compliance is often high {{in the setting of}} a formal clinical trial but drops off in a [...] "real-world" [...] setting.|$|E

2500|$|Simons noted height was {{a factor}} in the length Sharma bowled, saying [...] "For Ishant to hit the stumps, he has to pitch it fuller, and that means the batsman has more chance of keeping it out". Former West Indies fast bowler Courtney Walsh {{identified}} two problems with Sharma's bowling action: his head drops when the ball is delivered and the position of his wrist varies. The first takes some of the speed out of the delivery, while the second reduces the chance of the ball seaming and swinging. The former India batsman Sanjay Manjrekar suggested that the lack of movement in Sharma's bowling discouraged him from pitching the ball up so instead he tends to bowl short. The slower pace of his bowling when he pitches the ball up may explain why the yorker is not an <b>effective</b> <b>delivery</b> for him. Manjrekar went further, saying that [...] "for all his talent and commitment he just does not take enough wickets"; when the remark was made in January 2012, Sharma had a bowling average of nearly 37 from 43 Tests.|$|E

The main aim {{of this study is to}} investigate and identify the nature of and extent to which communities are given opportunities to participate in decision-making processes for <b>effective</b> service <b>delivery</b> in Lainya County. The main objectives of the study were to identify the obstacles to community participation in decision-making processes and how communities can be encouraged to participate effectively in decision-making, to meet their needs and interests. It further examines the extent to which communities play a role in promoting <b>effective</b> service <b>delivery</b> through participating in decision-making processes in Lainya County South Sudan. In this study, interviews, focus group discussions and observations were used as the main instruments for data collection on the issue of community participation as a tool for <b>effective</b> service <b>delivery</b> in Lainya County. These instruments are used to determine the extent to which communities are involved in decision-making processes to meet their needs and interests for <b>effective</b> service <b>delivery.</b> Data was collected from County officials comprising of Administrators, Chiefs, Women Associations Youth Associations and opinion leaders using both structured and unstructured interviews, focus group discussions and observations. Emerging from the study is that community participation is an integral part of the County developmental planning process. The study findings suggest that, public meetings, hearings, community workshops and seminars were the main mechanisms for community participation being used by the administrators. The study therefore, recommended among other things that; community participation be encouraged to promote community involvement in decision-making processes for <b>effective</b> service <b>delivery.</b> It also recommended that community participation and involvement be encouraged to initiate community development as it enhances program sustainability and ownership. The study further recommended that the top-down approach to decision making be replaced by bottom-up approaches, which emphasizes seeking communities’ ideas first before any developmental plans take place or are implemented. This study will significantly contribute to <b>effective</b> service <b>delivery</b> in Lainya County in the Republic of South Sudan...|$|R
