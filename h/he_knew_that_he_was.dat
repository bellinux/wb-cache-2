500|$|Tartakovsky {{has said}} the {{character}} Dexter was designed [...] "as an icon"—his body is short and squat and his design is simple, with a black outline and relatively little detail. Since <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> designing the show for television, he purposely limited the design to a certain degree, designing the nose and mouth, for instance, in a Hanna-Barbera style to animate easily.|$|E
500|$|Booth had a {{reputation}} for walking when <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> out, without waiting for the umpire's decision, and he was regarded as a player and leader of the highest principles. He was known for his record of instilling high standards of conduct into his players and prevented them from showing dissent towards unfavourable umpiring decisions. Robinson said that [...] "if a prize were offered for fairplaymanship among Australia's post-war cricketers Brian Booth ought to win it hands down". Lawry regarded Booth {{as one of the most}} gentlemanly cricketers that he knew.|$|E
2500|$|Fariña and Elaskar later recanted their statements. Fariña {{said on the}} TV program Intrusos en el espectáculo that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> being filmed, he lied to Lanata and {{he never}} carried bags of money. Elaskar said that he lied to harm Fariña. Gossip shows on state-sponsored TV {{channels}} called it the [...] "Fariña-Rossi case", focusing on {{the impact on the}} television personalities, ignoring ties to Báez and [...] Kirchner and downplaying the corruption charges. Rossi said that Fariña and Elaskar were deluded.|$|E

2500|$|It's a fantastically {{powerful}} recording {{that was}} done {{a matter of days}} before his death. It doesn't show on the recording, but Richard, who made the recording, said that between each poem Charles broke down and wept, and had to gather himself. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> dying. He was saying goodbye to each of his poems. If you only listen to one of the poems on the website, listen to [...] "Eden Rock". It's a great poem and he reads it so beautifully and introduces it so touchingly.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{successful}} conquest of southern Jing Province, Sun Quan relocated {{the capital of}} his territories to Wuchang (武昌; present-day Ezhou, Hubei), which was in southern Jing Province. In the same year, Sun Quan pledged nominal allegiance to Cao Pi, the emperor of the Cao Wei state, which had replaced the Eastern Han dynasty. In return, Cao Pi made Sun Quan a vassal king under the title [...] "King of (Eastern) Wu" [...] (吳王). Sun Quan then promoted Shi Yi to Major-General (裨將軍), appointed him as a Palace Attendant (侍中), and enfeoffed him as a Marquis of a Chief Village (都亭侯). Later, when Sun Quan wanted to put Shi Yi in command of more troops, Shi Yi firmly declined as <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not suitable to be a military commander.|$|E
2500|$|In 1972, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania {{used the}} term tax [...] "protestor" [...] (protester) in United States v. Malinowski. This case, however, {{involved}} a taxpayer {{who was a member}} of the Philadelphia War Tax Resistance League who was protesting the use of tax money in the Vietnam War. The taxpayer was not making arguments that the tax law itself was invalid; he was essentially protesting the war, not the tax. The taxpayer had filed a false Form W-4, and admitted <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> not legally entitled to claim the exemptions (allowances) he claimed on the W-4. Thus, Malinowski might be termed a tax resister rather than a tax protester. He was convicted, and his motion for a new trial or acquittal was denied.|$|E
60|$|You see it {{was this}} way: Reddy's wits were working very fast there in Farmer Brown's henhouse. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had only a forlorn chance of {{escaping}} when Farmer Brown's boy should come to open the henhouse in the morning. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must {{make the most of}} <b>that</b> forlorn chance. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> freedom is a thousand times better than a full stomach.|$|R

2500|$|According to one {{documented}} court proceeding in 1894, where Weber Jr. {{was being}} prosecuted {{for failing to}} pay a debt of $300 despite a large salary and having received $50,000 in cash and $200,000 in shares when his company went public, Weber Jr. was involved in the following: furnishing an extravagant apartment for his second wife, Miss Nina Farrington, who had overspent the amount he had guaranteed the store Hilton, Hughes & Co; failing to pay Hilton, Hughes & Co. any of the money he had guaranteed, prompting a lawsuit; [...] paying alimony to his first wife, actress Irene Perry, who had divorced him; frequenting illegal poker and gambling establishments; being present in a gambling house when it was raided by police; and guaranteeing money to others when <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was,</b> in fact, insolvent. [...] In the 1894 court proceeding, Weber Jr. admitted that he had been sued [...] "about seventy-five times" [...] for failing to pay his debts.|$|E
2500|$|For about a {{year and}} a half, Mussolini lived in Gargnano on Lake Garda in Lombardy. Although he insisted in public that he was in full control, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> little more than a puppet ruler under the {{protection}} of his German liberators—for all intents and purposes, the Gauleiter of Lombardy. After yielding to pressures from Hitler and the remaining loyal fascists who formed the government of the Republic of Salò, Mussolini helped orchestrate a series of executions of some of the fascist leaders who had betrayed him at the last meeting of the Fascist Grand Council. One of those executed was his son-in-law, Galeazzo Ciano. As Head of State and Minister of Foreign Affairs for the Italian Social Republic, Mussolini used much of his time to write his memoirs. Along with his autobiographical writings of 1928, these writings would be combined and published by Da Capo Press as My Rise and Fall. In an interview in January 1945 by Madeleine Mollier, a few months before he was captured and executed by Italian anti-fascist partisans, he stated flatly: [...] "Seven years ago, I was an interesting person. Now, I am little more than a corpse." [...] He continued: ...|$|E
2500|$|At 6:28a.m., {{two minutes}} {{ahead of the}} time set as H-Hour, Schroeder's unit {{was in the first}} wave of 20LCVPs to {{disembark}} on Utah Beach. Schroeder's own assault boat, commanded by navy Lieutenant (j.g.) Abraham Condiotti of Brooklyn, New York, was the first to hit the beach. In his boat were 32men, including Brigadier General Roosevelt. He recalled to a television interviewer in 2008 that [...] "80percent of the guys on the boat were sick" [...] due to the rough seas and, as his landing craft in the first wave neared the shore, Allied forces were still shelling Company F's designated landing site on Utah Beach. [...] "They were dropping all those bombs on the place where we were going in" [...] and his company had to disembark [...] "without getting bombed by our own guys". [...] He held his [...]45-caliber pistol above the waist-high water as he waded the final [...] from his landing craft to the beach. In the lead landing craft, he covered the remaining distance as quickly as possible due to enemy fire. The soldiers encountered machine gun fire from German pillboxes and artillery shelling, underwater mines, barbed wire, and trenches. His company's mission was to break up the enemy's fortified seawall and then liberate a village five miles inland. Half of his men were casualties and Schroeder himself was shot twice in the left arm. He was hospitalized in England and later in South Carolina and almost had his arm amputated due to the severity of his wounds. [...] Asked later if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> the first soldier on the beach, he said, [...] "I knew my company was in the first wave, but I didn't know I was actually {{going to be the first}} ashore. [...] Besides, I was too scared to think about it". Afterwards, he was hailed in a Pentagon press release as [...] "the first GI to invade Europe". The Baltimore Sun said of Schroeder afterwards, [...] "when his boot touched French soil, it was a great moment in history". He earned a Silver Star, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart during World War II, in addition to numerous other decorations.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{characterize}} some agent properties relating to reasoning about knowledge. The following facts are proved: if a reflexive agent has F, then F holds; if a transitive agent <b>knows</b> F, then <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> F (the positive introspection property); if an Euclidean agent does not <b>know</b> F, then <b>he</b> <b>knows</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> does not <b>know</b> F (the negative introspection property); a serial agent {{does not know}} F if F is a contradiction. Also, {{the concept of the}} more knowledgeable agent is introduced...|$|R
