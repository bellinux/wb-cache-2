5|$|While Seaborg {{applied for}} funding, Harvey {{worked on the}} {{einsteinium}} target, while Thomson and Choppin focused on methods for chemical isolation. Choppin suggested using α-hydroxyisobutyric acid to separate the mendelevium atoms {{from those of the}} lighter actinides. The actual synthesis was done by a recoil technique, introduced by Albert Ghiorso. In this technique, the einsteinium was placed {{on the opposite side of}} the target from the beam, so that the recoiling mendelevium atoms would get enough momentum to leave the target and be caught on a catcher foil made of gold. This recoil target was made by an electroplating technique, developed by Alfred Chetham-Strode. This technique gave a very high yield, which was absolutely necessary when working with such a rare and valuable product as the einsteinium target material. The recoil target consisted of 109 atoms of 253Es which were deposited electrolytically on a thin gold foil. It was bombarded by 41MeV alpha particles in the Berkeley cyclotron with a very <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> density of 6×1013 particles per second over an area of 0.05cm2. The target was cooled by water or liquid helium, and the foil could be replaced.|$|E

40|$|This {{analytical}} {{study examined}} the effects of mounting height on discomfort glare from reduced-power high-beam headlamps used as automotive daytime running lamps. Of interest were the effects for mounting heights between 0. 864 m (34 in) and 1. 372 m (54 in) - the range in which full-power low beams are currently allowed, but reduced-power <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> are not. Three analyses were performed. The first analysis involved estimating the illuminance reaching a preceding driver via rearview mirrors. The second analysis compared glare illuminance from reduced-power <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> with that from full-power low beams. The third analysis evaluated the expected changes in discomfort-glare ratings from reduced-power <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> as a function of increased mounting height. The analyses were based on photometric information from five <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> and 43 low beams from lamps manufactured for the United States market. They were performed for five following distances and three lateral offsets of the vehicles. The results indicate that allowing reduced-power <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> with mounting heights between 0. 864 m and 1. 372 m would not appreciably increase discomfort glare for preceding drivers as compared with (a) glare from reduced-power <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> at a mounting height of 0. 864 m, or with (b) glare from currently allowed full-power low beams...|$|R

25|$|Glare-free <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> is a camera-driven dynamic {{lighting}} control strategy that selectively shades spots and slices {{out of the}} <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> pattern to protect other road users from glare, while always providing the driver with maximum seeing range. The area surrounding other road users is constantly illuminated at <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> intensity, but without the glare that would result from using uncontrolled high beams in traffic. This constantly changing beam pattern requires complex sensors, microprocessors and actuators, because the vehicles which must be shadowed out of the beam are constantly moving. The dynamic shadowing can be achieved with movable shadow masks shifted within the light path inside the headlamp. Or, the effect {{can be achieved by}} selectively darkening addressable LED emitters or reflector elements, a technique known as 'Pixel light'.|$|E
25|$|Auxiliary <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> lamps may {{be fitted}} to provide high {{intensity}} light {{to enable the}} driver to see at longer range than the vehicle's <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> headlamps may be fitted.

They are common in countries with large stretches of unlit roads, or in regions such as the Nordic countries where the period of daylight is short during winter.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, the {{legality}} of headlight flashing varies from state to state. Some states consider that drivers have a First Amendment right to flash their headlights. In other states, law enforcement officers give citations for headlight flashing under three types of laws: (1) laws prohibiting a person from obstructing a police investigation, (2) laws prohibiting a person from having flashing lights on their vehicle, and (3) laws prohibiting shining a vehicle’s <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> at oncoming traffic. The specific language of each law varies by state along with courts’ holdings on whether their respective laws prohibit headlight flashing. Additionally, although not legally binding, the state driver’s manual of some states suggests flashing <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> under specific scenarios (e.g. if an oncoming vehicle is using its <b>high</b> <b>beams,</b> driver’s manuals suggest a motorist flash his or her <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> momentarily).|$|R

25|$|The first US halogen {{headlamp}} bulb, introduced in 1983, was the HB1/9004. It is a 12.8-volt, transverse dual-filament design that produces 700 lumens on low beam and 1200 lumens on <b>high</b> <b>beam.</b> The 9004 is rated for 65 watts (<b>high</b> <b>beam)</b> and 45 watts (low beam) at 12.8 volts. Other US approved halogen bulbs include the HB3 (65W, 12.8V), HB4 (55W, 12.8V), and HB5 (65/55 watts, 12.8V). All of the European-designed and internationally approved bulbs except H4 are presently approved {{for use in}} headlamps complying with US requirements.|$|E
25|$|Complex-reflector {{technology}} {{in combination with}} new bulb designs such as H13 is enabling the creation of European-type low and <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> patterns {{without the use of}} a Graves Shield, while the 1992 US approval of the H4 bulb has made traditionally European 60% / 40% optical area divisions for low and <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> common in the US. Therefore, the difference in active optical area and overall beam light content no longer necessarily exists between US and ECE beams. Dual-beam HID headlamps employing reflector technology have been made using adaptations of both techniques.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposite}} tactic {{has also}} been employed in certain 2-filament sealed beams. Placing the low beam filament at the focal point to maximize light collection by the reflector, and positioning the <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> filament slightly rearward-rightward-downward of the focal point. The relative directional shift between the two beams is the same with either technique – in a right-traffic country, the low beam is slightly downward-rightward and the <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> is slightly upward-leftward, relative to one another – but the lens optics must be matched to the filament placements selected.|$|E

25|$|Each {{system has}} its {{advantages}} and disadvantages. The American system historically permitted a greater overall {{amount of light}} within the low beam, since the entire reflector and lens area is used, {{but at the same}} time, the American system has traditionally offered much less control over upward light that causes glare, and for that reason has been largely rejected outside the US. In addition, the American system makes it difficult to create markedly different low and <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> light distributions. The <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> is usually a rough copy of the low beam, shifted slightly upward and leftward. The European system traditionally produced low beams containing less overall light, because only 60% of the reflector's surface area is used to create the low beam. However, low beam focus and glare control are easier to achieve. In addition, the lower 40% of the reflector and lens are reserved for <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> formation, which facilitates the optimization of both low and high beams.|$|E

The <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> and turn signal functions use filament bulbs. The headlamp is supplied by Koito.|$|E
25|$|The {{range of}} the beam can vary between 65 and 300 meters, {{depending}} on traffic conditions. In traffic, the low beam cutoff position is adjusted vertically to maximise seeing range while keeping glare out of leading and oncoming drivers' eyes. When no traffic is close enough for glare to be a problem, the system provides full <b>high</b> <b>beam.</b> Headlamps are adjusted every 40 milliseconds by a camera {{on the inside of}} the front windscreen which can determine distance to other vehicles. The S-Class, CLS-Class and C-Class also offer this technology. In the CLS, the adaptive <b>high</b> <b>beam</b> is realised with LED headlamps - the first vehicle producing all adaptive light functions with LEDs. Since 2010 some Audi models with Xenon headlamps are offering a similar system: adaptive light with variable headlight range control.|$|E
25|$|<b>High</b> <b>beam</b> (main beam, driving beam, full beam) {{headlamps}} {{provide a}} bright, center-weighted distribution of light with no particular control of light directed towards other road users' eyes.

40|$|Drivers in {{this study}} participated in a field {{operational}} test of two crash warning systems and were unaware that data about their high-beam use were being collected. Drivers were given instrumented vehicles to drive as their own car for periods ranging from 7 to 27 days. Most of the driving was in southeastern Michigan. The results indicate that high-beam headlamp use is low, a finding consistent with previous studies that used different methods. Combined over all drivers and all road types, <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> were used for 3. 1 % of the distance driven at night. Drivers used <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> most frequently on local roads, but even that use was only 8. 9 %. Under the most favorable conditions for high-beam use (rural roads with, no opposing or preceding vehicles), drivers used their <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> 25. 4 % of the nighttime distance driven. Older drivers used <b>high</b> <b>beams</b> three times more frequently than did younger drivers, suggesting that older drivers, to at least some extent, understand their visual impairment at night, and therefore take some compensatory measures. Because low beams do not provide sufficient illumination in many driving situations, the present findings imply that (1) increased high-beam use should be encouraged and (2) the use of automatic switching between <b>high</b> and low <b>beams</b> {{is likely to be}} beneficial...|$|R
