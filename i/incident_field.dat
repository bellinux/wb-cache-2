40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA quantitative {{evaluation of the}} limitations of the radiation boundary elements in the finite element code ATILA has been performed. Five three dimensional models were employed, each representing a rigid spherical solid surrounded by water. Monopolar, dipolar and quadrupolar incident spherical waves were introduced and the corresponding scattered waves were computed using the ATILA code and an exact analytical solution. The dimensionless parameters that characterize the problem are ka, kL, and kR where k is the wavenumber of sound in water, a is the radius of the scatterer, R is the outer fluid mesh radius, and L is the thickness of the fluid layer. The range of values investigated were kR = 1. 5, 2. 5, 4. 0, ka = 0. 5, 1. 0, 2. 0 and kL = 0. 5, 1. 0. For axially symmetric <b>incident</b> <b>fields,</b> the maximum normalized errors occurred at the poles and were 9 %, 12 %, and 6 % respectively. Furthermore, the errors for monopolar and dipolar <b>incident</b> <b>fields</b> were strongly influenced by the location of the radiation boundary (kR), less so by the scatterer's radius (ka); specifically the error decreases with increasing kR andlor ka. The errors for quadrupolar <b>incident</b> <b>fields</b> do not exhibit any significant dependence on kR or ka. The errors for all the axially symmetric <b>incident</b> <b>fields</b> were not affected by variations of the element's size (kL). For non-axially symmetric <b>incident</b> <b>fields,</b> the maximum deviation occurred at the equatorial points and was less than 5. 5 %. Further investigation using a two-dimensional model is proposed {{in order to determine the}} range of values of ka, kL, and kR which will result in negligibly small errors. [URL] Hellenic Nav...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} the inverse obstacle scattering problem. In the recent years several non-iterative {{methods have been}} proposed to reconstruct obstacles (penetrable or impenetrable) from near or far field measurements. In the chronological order, we cite among others the linear sampling method, the factorization method, the probe method and the singular sources method. These methods use differently the measurements to detect the unknown obstacle and they {{require the use of}} many <b>incident</b> <b>fields</b> (i. e. the full or a part of the far field map). More recently, two other approaches have been added. They are the no-response test and the range test. Both of them use few <b>incident</b> <b>fields</b> to detect some informations about the scatterer. All the mentioned methods are based on building functions depending on some parameter. These functions share the property that their behaviors with respect to the parameter change drastically. The surface of the obstacle is located at most in the interface where these functions become large. The goal of this work is to investigate the relation between some of the non-iterative reconstruction schemes regarding the convergence issue. A given method is said to be convergent if it reconstructs a part or the entire obstacle by using few or many <b>incident</b> <b>fields</b> respectively. For simplicity we consider the obstacle reconstruction problem from far field data for the Helmholtz equation...|$|R
