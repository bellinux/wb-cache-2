5|$|He gave a {{magnificent}} speech. He {{is one of}} the cleverest speakers I have ever heard. The questions on the Mundt-Nixon bill, his views on the loyalty oath, and the problem of international communism were just what he was waiting for. Indeed, he was so skillful—and, I might add, cagey—that those who came indifferent were sold, and even many of those who came to heckle went away with doubts... If he is only a fraction as effective as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>here</b> you have a formidable opponent on your hands.|$|E

500|$|More than an {{estimated}} 5,000 gathered for Taveras's funeral in Sosúa, including about 40 who {{gathered on the}} rooftop of a cemetery church. Many of the mourners wore jerseys with [...] "El Fenómeno" [...] printed on their backs. [...] "He was like Superman here. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>here</b> to uplift kids and put the town on the map. He was the hope." [...] said teammate Carlos Martínez. Martínez requested to change his uniform number from 44 to 18 (Taveras's number) to honor him {{in part because they}} were also friends. The team granted his request. Taveras had left behind a one-year-old son, Oscar Yadier Taveras.|$|E

500|$|Penn's captain, Bill Hollenback, said: “This fellow Schulz is {{a monster}} {{in size and}} a perfect athlete. [...] He is both wonderfully agile and fast {{for a man of}} his size. [...] In our game with Michigan, we had two men {{instructed}} to play against Schulz and at times three and four were opposed to him. [...] For some time, he handed out as much as we passed to him in the roughing end of the game. [...] <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>here,</b> there and everywhere. He did most of the tackling. [...] He broke up innumerable plays. [...] He was the star of the contest until the continued battering of our men injured him {{to such an extent that}} he had to retire. [...] The rest was easy". [...] Coach Yost said of Schulz's performance: [...] "He gave the greatest one-man exhibition of courage I ever saw on a football field".|$|E
500|$|His {{work was}} {{disturbed}} in February 1829 by the unexpected {{death of his}} eldest daughter Catherine, who was only four years old. This led him to reconsider his position on religion—previously an agnostic, his interest in Christianity was renewed, and having read the Bible, {{the works of the}} theologian William Paley as well as more skeptical works such as Hume's On Miracles, he came to acknowledge the [...] "moral truth" [...] of the gospels, while remaining opposed to the doctrines of orthodox Christianity. Despite this personal tragedy, and his own continued ill health, Prescott had gathered sufficient material to begin drafting the History in October 1829. At around this time, Prescott read the works of Gabriel Bonnot de Mably, including his historiographical piece De l’étude de l’histoire. He henceforth aimed to write history to de Mably's romantic ideal, and {{on more than one occasion}} expressed his indebtedness to him. Prescott also encountered Elogia de la Réina Doña Isabel, by his Spanish contemporary Diego Clemencín, which helped shape his views concerning the monarchs' political roles. Due to further problems with his eyesight, it took him sixteen months to write the first three hundred pages of the History. It was largely finished by 1834, but Prescott dedicated two years to abridging and redrafting it. He was also briefly engaged in writing a biography of Charles Brockden Brown for Jared Sparks' Library of American Biography. Prescott was not familiar with American literature, and he based the work on other contemporary biographies of Brown. As a result, the biography has had little academic impact. In 1835, he took residence in the rural town of Nahant, Massachusetts, due to concerns about his health. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>here</b> accustomed to riding his horses for the purpose of exercise, and he persevered even in sub-zero temperatures. Prescott finished the concluding chapter of the work in July 1836, and despite the amount of time and effort which he had spent on the work, [...] was at first unsure about publishing it. However, his father argued that refusing to do so would amount to cowardice, and this swayed him. Prescott had previously considered publishing the work in London first, and therefore a printed draft copy of the work was sent to a Colonel Aspinwall for consideration. However, both Longman and Murray, which were at the time the leading British publishers, refused the work, and Prescott decided to postpone.|$|E

Over in DunBroch, Merida puts a flower on her father’s grave and tells him she saved the boys and proved she’s fit to be queen. She says now it’s even harder since she has to rule and her father made it look easy. She says she wishes <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>here</b> so she could ask him how he did it.

It’s just like acting, you make things up, you wear a wig and a funny outfit. Why not the law?' But I just always, always wanted to act, {{as far back as}} I remember." [...] Her joining the Royal Shakespeare Company though, finally won her parents over. However, in a 2004 {{interview}} Oberman noted that her father's death seven years earlier prevented his seeing the development of her career and her national success as an actor: [...] "I've {{come a long way in}} my career since he died and I wish <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>here</b> to see it. He was a big EastEnders fan so I know he'd be very, very proud of me." ...|$|E

Later that night, Triple H defeated Hart, while DX and The Nation interfered in the main event tag team match, in which all members of both stables brawled {{until the end of}} the show. The following week on Raw Is War, DX cut a promo that insulted The Nation, which led to The Nation and DX brawling until WWF officials broke up the fight. After the brawl was settled, DX members Road Dogg and Billy Gunn defeated The Rock and D'Lo Brown of The Nation in a tag team match, further enhancing their feud. On the final episode of Raw is War before Over the Edge, The Rock, a member of The Nation, and DX member Triple H fought to a double countout.|$|E

2500|$|Scene I: Sir Oliver (as Mr. Stanley) now visits Joseph. Joseph, like Charles, {{does not}} {{recognise}} his long-lost uncle. He greets [...] "Stanley" [...] with effusive professions of goodwill, but refuses to give [...] "Stanley" [...] any financial assistance, saying he has donated {{all his money}} to support Charles. [...] "Stanley" [...] suggests that Sir Oliver would help him if <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>here,</b> and that Joseph might pass on some of what Sir Oliver has given him. But Joseph tells [...] "Stanley" [...] that Sir Oliver is in fact very stingy, and has given him nothing except trinkets such as tea, shawls, and [...] "Indian crackers". Furthermore, Joseph has lent {{a great deal to}} his brother, so that he has nothing left for [...] "Stanley". Sir Oliver is enraged, as he knows both statements are flat lies – he sent Joseph 12,000 pounds from India. He stifles his anger, and departs amid further effusions. Rowley arrives with a letter for Joseph announcing that Sir Oliver has arrived in town.|$|E

[...] George Seah's son told the press that although all his father wanted was an apology, the family would not reject any goodwill payments. Tan Sri Wan Suleiman Pawanteh's wife said: [...] "Although I thank the prime minister, I feel less than satisfied at his decision (not to make a straightforward apology). This {{is not the end of}} the story for me. (Without an apology) I don't know, people don't know, that my husband was not guilty. I want my husband's name to be cleared. I feel my husband was innocent. He was an honest judge...Even so, I am thankful that our prime minister cares about us enough (to do this much)." [...] Tan Sri Eusoffe Abdoolcader's granddaughter regretted that acknowledgement had been so late in coming: [...] "I wish <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>here.</b> He's the main person affected by all this. It's a different case from the others (Salleh and Wan Suleiman) because he was reinstated. It's been 12 years. It should have been solved earlier."
