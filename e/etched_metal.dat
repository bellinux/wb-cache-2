50|$|KPR, {{originally}} {{known as}} Kodak Photoresist, is a photosensitive material used in photoengraving, Photogravure and photolithography. Once dried KPR can be dissolved by several solvents but after exposure to strong ultraviolet light it hardens and becomes insoluble {{by some of}} these solvents. It is also resistant to acid, ferric chloride and other chemicals used to <b>etch</b> <b>metals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Organic {{chemicals}} such as {{lactic acid}} and citric acid {{have been used}} to <b>etch</b> <b>metals</b> and create products as early as 400 BCE, when vinegar was used to corrode lead and create the pigment ceruse, also known as white lead. Most modern chemical milling methods involve alkaline etchants; these may have been used as early as the first century CE.|$|R

50|$|The disused {{colliery}} at Snibston was regenerated into Snibston Discovery Park but controversially {{closed in}} 2015 by Leicestershire County Council. The area formerly occupied by Whitwick Colliery has been redeveloped as the Whitwick Business Park and which incorporates a Morrison's supermarket. There {{is also a}} small memorial garden here, established in memory of 35 men {{who died in the}} Whitwick Colliery Disaster of 1898, which occurred {{as a result of an}} underground fire, though sadly, the <b>etched</b> <b>metal</b> plaque commemorating this terrible calamity has (of 2014) been removed from the large granite memorial boulder.|$|E
50|$|The tablah {{is a small}} hand-drum, {{also known}} as the durbakke. Most tablahs are beautifully decorated, some with wood, tile or bone inlay, <b>etched</b> <b>metal,</b> or {{paintings}} in designs typical of the Near East. One of the most commonly played percussion instrument, the tablah is a membranophone of goat or fish skin stretched over a vase-shaped drum with a wide neck. Usually made of earthenware or metal, it is placed either under the left arm or between the legs and struck in the middle for the strong beats and on the edge for the sharp in-between beats.|$|E
40|$|Plasma {{discharges}} involving {{mixtures of}} chlorine and boron trichloride {{are widely used}} to <b>etch</b> <b>metals</b> {{in the production of}} very-large-scale-integrated circuits. Energetic ions {{play a critical role in}} this process, influencing the etch rates, etch profiles, and selectivity to different materials. The authors are using a gridded energy analyzer to measure positive ion energy distributions and fluxes at the grounded electrode of high-density inductively-coupled rf discharges.

50|$|He assembles curved {{and folded}} sheets of metal {{in a simple}} way but the {{complexity}} comes in the combination of curves and straight lines, along with plates and modular pieces. Originally he worked in carbon steel which he soldered and painted in acrylic enamel. Later he discovered that various acids {{could be used to}} <b>etch</b> <b>metal</b> and achieve different textures. He began to use thin sheets of aluminum to make designs. He got the idea from an exhibition of work by Ã‰dgar Negret, which {{was the first time he}} had seen sculpture done in aluminum.|$|R
5000|$|CDCs {{have been}} {{synthesized}} using several chemical and physical synthesis methods. Most commonly, dry chlorine treatment {{is used to}} selectively <b>etch</b> <b>metal</b> or metalloid atoms from the carbide precursor lattice. The term [...] "chlorine treatment" [...] is to be preferred over chlorination as the chlorinated product, metal chloride, is the discarded byproduct and the carbon itself remains largely unreacted. This method is implemented for commercial production of CDC by Skeleton in Estonia and Carbon-Ukraine. Hydrothermal etching has also been used for synthesis of SiC-CDC which yielded a route for porous carbon films and nanodiamond synthesis.|$|R
50|$|Specialized kits cast in resin are {{available}} from companies such as Anigrand, Collect Aire, CMK, CMR, and Unicraft, made in molds {{similar to those used}} for limited run plastic kits, but usually not as durable, hence the much smaller numbers of each kit that are made, and their higher price.Vacuum forming is another common alternative to injection molded kits but require more skill to assemble, and usually lack detail parts that must be supplied by the modeller. There is a handful of photo <b>etched</b> <b>metal</b> kits which allow a high level of detail but can be laborious to assemble, and lack the ability to replicate certain shapes.|$|E
5000|$|Modification of {{electrodes}} {{has developed}} beyond the size parameter. SECM-AFM probes {{can act as}} both a force sensor and electrode through the utilization of a flattened, <b>etched</b> <b>metal</b> wire coated by electrophoretic paint. In this system, the flattened wire acts as a flexible cantilever to measure the force against a sample (AFM) as the wire electrode measures the current (SECM). [...] Similarly, SECM functionality can be imparted into standard AFM probes by sputtering the surface with a conductive metal or by milling an insulated tip with a Focused Ion Beam (FIB). More recently, Electron Beam Lithography has been demonstrated to reproducibly generate SECM-AFM probes using silicon wafers.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the trains and track, available accessories include a large variety of scenic items: houses and apartment buildings, figures and animals, trees, bikes, boats and more. The houses are assembled and pre-painted, with fully detailed interiors that the modeler can install. The plastic figures, <b>etched</b> <b>metal</b> bikes, and other small items have small pins to make installation on a layout easier; the modeler simply makes a hole and inserts the detail into the hole using a toolkit available from Eishindo. Road signs, traffic lights and other street furniture is available, {{as well as a}} street decoration decal sheet, which comes with a scale ruler to aid the placement of markings and details.|$|E
50|$|Boron trichloride is a {{starting}} {{material for the}} production of elemental boron. It is also used in the refining of aluminium, magnesium, zinc, and copper alloys to remove nitrides, carbides, and oxides from molten metal. It {{has been used as a}} soldering flux for alloys of aluminium, iron, zinc, tungsten, and monel. Aluminum castings can be improved by treating the melt with boron trichloride vapors. In the manufacture of electrical resistors, a uniform and lasting adhesive carbon film can be put over a ceramic base using BCl3. It has been used in the field of high energy fuels and rocket propellants as a source of boron to raise BTU value. BCl3 is also used in plasma etching in semiconductor manufacturing. This gas <b>etches</b> <b>metal</b> oxides by formation of a volatile BOClx compounds.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we report on}} {{experiments}} which indicate the necessity {{of the use of}} ion-beam bombardment for e-beam deposited multilayer x-ray coatings. Measurements are described in which ion bombardment (200 - 300 eV Ar+) is used to ion <b>etch</b> <b>metal</b> layers after initial deposition and during deposition (ion-assisted deposition). In both cases a considerable smoothing of the metal surface occurs, resulting in enhanced x-ray reflectivities of metal-carbon multilayer coatings. As examples we show reflection measurements of Ni-C and W-C with nine and ten layer pairs, respectively, and d almost-equal-to 2. 8 nm. Finally we discuss a special case: ion etching of Mo layers in Mo-Si coatings. On the one hand, we demonstrate the occurrence of smoothing of Mo, thereby enhancing the reflectivity of the layer and, on the other hand, the occurrence of ion bombardment induced intermixing at the Mo-Si interface, responsible for a decrease of the reflectivity...|$|R

Though today fishskin heads are rarely used due to the climate. When used it becomes loose, you would have to heat the head to get the correct sound back. The membrane or head of the drum is now made out of plastic. The most common head is from Alexandria, Egypt.|$|E
5000|$|MIL-STD-130 {{standard}} requires qualifying government furnished {{property in}} possession of contractors (PIPC), and qualifying end item deliverables or legacy items to be marked with a machine readable 2D Data Matrix bar code. There are several allowed methods for marking, the most common being a polyester or polymide label marked with a thermal transfer printer (the cheapest is about $3,000). Other methods are: metal nameplate laser <b>etched,</b> <b>metal</b> plate metalphoto processed, direct part-marked by dot peen, ink jet, laser etch or chemical etch. The bar code must meet several quality specifications, pass a verification process with a grade of 'B' or better, and [...] "be as permanent as the normal life expectancy of the item and be capable of withstanding the environmental tests and cleaning procedures specified for the item {{to which it is}} affixed". A full list of suggested marking methods are outlined in Table II of MIL-STD-130N.|$|E

5000|$|Typical {{preparation}} of a microscale electrode is performed by heat sealing a microwire or carbon fiber {{in a glass}} capillary under vacuum. This tip can be connected to a larger copper electrode {{through the use of}} silver epoxy then polished to yield a sharpened tip. Nanofabrication of electrodes can be performed by etching a metal wire with sodium cyanide and sodium hydroxide. <b>Etched</b> <b>metal</b> wires can then be coated with wax, varnish, molten paraffin or glass, poly(a-methylstyrene), polyimide,electropolymerized phenol, and electrophoretic paint. [...] Nanotips produced by these methods are conical, however disc-shaped tips can be obtained by micropipette pulling of glass sealed electrodes. Nanoscale electrodes allow for high resolution experiments of biological features of sub micron scale or single molecule analysis. [...] "Penetration" [...] experiments, where the tip is inserted into a microstructure (such as a thin polymer film with fixed redox centers) to probe kinetic and concentration parameters, also require the use of nanoscale electrodes. However, microelectrodes remain ideal for quantitative kinetic and feedback mode experiments due to their increased surface area.|$|E
30|$|In the {{fabrication}} process, Ar IBE method {{was used to}} etch metal layers except the Au layer etching on the Ti resistive line layer. The Ar IBE method is an anisotropic etching method, which can be applicable various metals because this method is using only an Ar ion bombardment onto the material. In {{the case of the}} Ar IBE method, the Ar ion beam incident angle is the most important process parameter and should be selected to reduce re-adhesion of <b>etched</b> <b>metal</b> onto the patterned photoresist side wall. The re-adhesion of <b>etched</b> <b>metal</b> forms a thin metal wall, which is difficult to remove and causes an electrical short.|$|E

40|$|In recent years, gas cluster ion beams (GCIB) {{have become}} {{the cutting edge of}} ion beam {{technology}} to sputter etch organic materials in surface analysis. However, little is currently known on the ability of argon cluster ions (Arn+) to <b>etch</b> <b>metal</b> oxides and other technologically important inorganic compounds and no depth profiles have previously been reported. In this work, XPS depth profiles through a certified (European standard BCR- 261 T) 30 nm thick Ta 2 O 5 layer grown on Ta foil using monatomic Ar+ and Ar 1000 + cluster ions have been performed at different incident energies. The preferential sputtering of oxygen induced using 6 keV Ar 1000 + ions is lower relative to 3 keV and 500 eV Ar+ ions. The depth profiling etch rate and depth resolution is substantially better for the monatomic beam compared to the cluster beam. Ar+ ions exhibit a steady state O/Ta ratio through the bulk oxide but Ar 1000 + ions show a gradual decrease in the O/Ta ratio as a function of depth. Higher residual O concentrations are observed on the Ta bulk metal for the Ar 1000 + profiles compared to the Ar+ profiles...|$|R

40|$|The next {{generation}} of cryodetector arrays for direct WIMP searches will aim to achieve large increases in WIMP-nucleon scattering target mass, {{an order of magnitude}} or more greater than existing detector arrays. The implementation of high-resolution measurements and background suppression by event discrimination will remain of paramount importance. Hardware development must be undertaken to increase the availability and density of read out channels while maintaining low-noise, low-heatload, high-radiopurity cryodetector performance. This thesis describes the development of scalable cryogenic cabling using <b>etched</b> <b>metal</b> foil fabrication techniques and the development of low-temperature high-voltage power supply for scintillation light readout using photomultiplier tubes. <b>Etched</b> <b>metal</b> foil cables were developed for cryodetector read out. Fabrication techniques for low-heatload, low-cost cabling were developed and commissioning tests were carried out to verify low-noise performance in both low-impedance and high-impedance cryodetector read out schemes. SQUID readout cabling with a heatload cost 24 times lower than existing cabling was installed and mean SQUID noise of 5. 5 pAHz-l/ 2 was measured with low- impedance input. Photomultiplier tubes can be used for cryogenic scintillation light measurement, a key technique in cryodetector event discrimination. A low-heatload, low-noise photomultiplier tube power supply circuit was developed.
