5|$|Settlers cleared {{much of the}} Catlins' coastal {{vegetation}} for farmland, but in {{some areas}} the original coastal plant life survives, primarily around cliff edges {{and some of the}} bays close to the Tautuku Peninsula, these being furthest from the landward edges of the <b>forest.</b> <b>Plant</b> life here includes many native species adapted to the strong salt-laden winds found in this exposed region. The Catlins coastal daisy (Celmisia lindsayii) is unique to the region, and is related to New Zealand's mountain daisies. Tussocks, hebes, and flaxes are common, as are native gentians, though sadly the endangered native sedge pingao can now rarely be found. In years when the southern rātā flowers well, the coastal forest canopy turns bright red. The rātā also thrives in some inland areas.|$|E
500|$|The Catlins {{features}} dense temperate rainforest, {{dominated by}} podocarps. This {{is the largest}} area of native forest remaining on the South Island's east coast, with over [...] of forest and neighbouring subalpine areas being protected in Catlins Conservation Park. The forest is thick with trees such as rimu, totara, silver beech, matai and kahikatea. Of particular note are the virgin rimu and totara forest remaining in those areas which were too rugged or steep to have been milled by early settlers, and an extensive area of silver beech forest close to the Takahopa River. This is New Zealand's most southerly expanse of beech forest. Many native species of <b>forest</b> <b>plant</b> {{can be found in}} the undergrowth of the Catlins forest, including young lancewoods, orchids such as the spider orchid and perching Easter orchid, and many different native ferns.|$|E

40|$|A {{successful}} forest {{generation is}} important for several operators and a lot can happen on the way from nursery to established plant. Therefore traceability of <b>forest</b> <b>plants</b> is important. Sveaskog is one of Sweden’s big producers of <b>forest</b> <b>plants</b> thru their business Svenska skogsplantor. Today it’s possible to trace <b>forest</b> <b>plants</b> grown by Svenska skogsplantor and planted by Sveaskog, but the chain of traceability cannot be considered unbroken since its partially uncertain under the treatment {{what happens to the}} plants. Today systems with barcodes, computer systems and applications in smartphones can be at help to create unbroken chains of traceability and the purpose of this work was to examine of what an extended traceability of <b>forest</b> <b>plants</b> could be.

2500|$|The Mendocino cypress {{is highly}} {{variable}} in growth form, depending on soil conditions. In the pygmy <b>forest</b> <b>plant</b> community on poor, acidic, nutrient-starved podsol soils with drainage impeded by an iron hardpan, it is a stunted tree from 0.2–5meters in height at maturity. When occurring in its pygmy form, {{it is sometimes}} called pygmy cypress. [...] When growing on deep, well-drained soils {{it can be a}} large tree up to 30–50meters in height and 1–2.4m in trunk diameter. The bark is dark gray-brown, with stringy texture, and fissured on old trees.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the events}} of World War I, where Richard St. Barbe Baker had served in France, St. Barbe went to Cambridge University and {{earned a degree in}} Forestry at Caius College. He then went to Kenya in 1920 to serve under the Colonial Office as Assistant Conservator of Forests. There he saw wide scale {{deforestation}} going on. St. Barbe also intervened in a case of a colonial officer against a Kikuyu worker – taking a blow aimed at the worker, which would eventually alienate him from the service. He developed a plan for re-forestation where food crops were planted between rows of young native trees. Because of lack of funds, St. Barbe consulted with the Kenyans themselves, approaching the Kikuyu Chiefs and Elders, and together they arranged for three thousand tribal warriors to come to his camp and, {{with the assistance of the}} Chiefs, fifty were selected to be the first Men of the Trees. They promised before Ngai, the High God, that they would protect the native <b>forest,</b> <b>plant</b> ten native trees each year, and take care of trees everywhere. Immediately then leaving Kenya, St. Barbe offered a paper at a Congress of Living Religions in the Commonwealth about the Bantu religion, following which he was introduced to the Bahá'í Faith because [...] "his genuine interest in another's religion struck a sympathetic chord with the Bahá'í principles." [...] On going to British Mandate of Palestine for pilgrimage he engaged leaders of religions in the Men of the Trees initiative, including then head of the Bahá'í Faith Shoghi Effendi, the Chancellor of the Hebrew University, the Grand Mufti of the Supreme Muslim Council as well as Orthodox and Catholic patriarchs. St. Barbe returned to Kenya briefly in 1976 when he acted as a special adviser to the Bahá'í delegation at a UN conference in Nairobi, in 1976.|$|E
