40|$|What is the {{appropriate}} allocation of rights and obligations when one party, without authorization, substantially improves the property of another? According to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> <b>accession,</b> a good faith improver may take title to such improved property, subject to compensating the original owner {{for the value of}} the source materials. While shifting title to a converter seems like a remarkable remedy, this outcome merely underscores the equitable nature of accession, which aims for fair allocation of property rights and compensation between two parties who both have plausible claims to an improved asset. This Article draws upon accession-a physical property doctrine with roots in Roman civil law-to enhance patent law 2 ̆ 7 s treatment of technological improvement. While patents and property exhibit significant differences, this Article argues that accession-with some modification can provide valuable guidance for allocating rights and obligations when an infringer substantially improves on another party 2 ̆ 7 s patented technology. Drawing on the Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s decision in eBay v. MercExchange, it proposes that courts apply accession in equitable determinations to deny injunctive relief and compel 2 ̆ 2 substantially improving 2 ̆ 2 infringers to compensate patentees through ongoing royalties. Accession would thus shift meaningful ownership of enhanced technologies to improvers based in part on their substantial contributions to those technologies. Such liability-rule protection would ameliorate holdup in 2 ̆ 2 blocking patents 2 ̆ 2 scenarios, provide a viable alternative to the rarely used reverse doctrine of equivalents, and encourage the dissemination of improved technologies. While this proposal seems radical, this Article shows that elements of the 2 ̆ 2 accession insight 2 ̆ 2 already appear in eBay and its progeny. The Article concludes by exploring the theoretical implications of accession for the intersection of patents and property...|$|E

The changes in these doctrines, from their first appearance in the early civiI law or Code of Justinian to the present, often reflect the historic changes {{in the composition of}} products, the legal relationship between labor and capital and the changes in the dominant mode of production. The purpose of this inquiry is to determine if a legal rationale exists which justifies collective ownership of the means of production. 1...|$|R
40|$|When {{one party}} makes {{significant}} but unauthorized improvements to another 2 ̆ 7 s land, chattels or informational assets, should the 2 ̆ 2 improving 2 ̆ 2 {{nature of the}} act alter the liability or remedy calculus? Traditional property law has long had to resolve conflicts that arise when one person improves another 2 ̆ 7 s land or chattels without permission [...] for example, if A cuts down B 2 ̆ 7 s trees and fashions a chair, or A erects a building on B 2 ̆ 7 s land. Ordinarily, A would be liable and subject to an injunction because B has a strict right to exclude that is protected by a property rule. But various doctrines in traditional property law, like the <b>doctrines</b> <b>of</b> <b>accession,</b> mistaken improvers <b>of</b> land, and ameliorative waste, make exceptions for improvers. These doctrines either excuse the improver from liability or mandate a remedy more hospitable to the improver. I refer to these assorted rules as 2 ̆ 2 improvement doctrines 2 ̆ 2 and articulate a multi-part framework for understanding the equity and efficiency concerns animating them. In so doing, this article challenges the presumption that property law unwaveringly favors strict exclusive rights for owners [...] a presumption that is often invoked by those advocating strict exclusive rights for intellectual property owners. This article demonstrates that unlike property law, intellectual property law has been less receptive to improvement doctrines. This is surprising given intellectual property 2 ̆ 7 s normative commitment to progress and innovation. Patented inventions and copyrighted expressive works often build on what came before. While patent law 2 ̆ 7 s “reverse <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> equivalents” and copyright 2 ̆ 7 s “fair use” doctrine may provide relief for unauthorized improvers in certain cases, these intellectual property doctrines are often indifferent to improvement. Given the uncertainty of intellectual property boundaries and the societal consequences of deterring improvement, the concerns motivating traditional property 2 ̆ 7 s improvement doctrines apply with even greater force to intellectual property. Accordingly, this article suggests potential areas of reform in patent and copyright law to enhance and regularize judicial consideration of unauthorized improvement at the liability and remedies stages...|$|R

40|$|The Bible {{as a whole}} {{establishes}} the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. The New Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin is developed on {{the foundation of the}} Old Testament <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Paul and John speak particularly on the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. So a study <b>of</b> their <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin would contribute to a total Biblical understanding. The problem of this study is the Biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin limited to the New Testament writers, John and Paul, as they speak <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole. Since the problem concerns the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as stated by the New Testament writers, John and Paul, in relation to the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin as a whole, it is necessary to consider several definite facts. In order to understand sin it is first necessary to show its relationship to man in a study of theological anthropology. It is also necessary to show the relationship of Paul and John 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. In order to correctly understand either John or Paul 2 ̆ 7 s <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin it is first necessary to review the Bible teaching regarding man in relation to sin. The <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin is not understood apart from man. The study of man in relation to sin is titled 2 ̆ 2 Theological Anthropology. 2 ̆ 2 It is presented as the first study in order to fully understand man in relation to the biblical <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin. Man 2 ̆ 7 s origin, man as a sinner and man under grace are the three aspects of this study of theological anthropology. John and Paul are generally recognized as the main theologians in the New Testament. John 2 ̆ 7 s purpose in writing the Gospel was to convince the reader that this was the Christ and that believing he should have eternal life. His purpose in the First Epistle was the enhance his joy, to keep the Christian from sin, to lead them into an assurance of salvation and to warn them against error. Certain aspects <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin are still presented in the Gospel. More <b>of</b> the <b>doctrine</b> <b>of</b> sin appears in the First Epistle of John.
