5|$|On 11May the briefcase, {{complete}} with the documents, was returned to Haselden by the Spanish authorities; he forwarded it to London in the diplomatic bag. On receipt the documents were forensically examined, and the missing <b>eyelash</b> noted. Further tests showed that the fibres in the paper had been damaged by folding more than once, which confirmed that the letters had been extracted and read. An additional test was made as the papers – still wet {{by the time they}} returned to London – were dried out: the folded paper dried into the rolled form it had when the Spaniards had extracted it from the envelope. To allay any potential German fears that their activities had been discovered, another pre-arranged encrypted but breakable cable was sent to Haselden stating that the envelopes had been examined and that they had not been opened; Haselden leaked the news to Spaniards known to be sympathetic to the Germans.|$|E

25|$|An <b>eyelash</b> curler is a {{hand-operated}} {{mechanical device}} for curling eyelashes for cosmetic purposes. The earliest patent for an <b>eyelash</b> curler was filed on August 15, 1929 and issued to William E. McDonell and Charles W. Stickel of Rochester, New York on April 7, 1931.|$|E
40|$|Disclosed herein is an {{attaching}} device for extension <b>eyelashes</b> adapted to attach false <b>eyelashes</b> to natural <b>eyelashes</b> by overlapping the false <b>eyelashes</b> containing an adhesive {{with the natural}} <b>eyelashes</b> and applying heat to the adhesive. The device includes a body defining a space therein and shaped to be held by a hand. A support is formed on an end {{of the body to}} support the false <b>eyelashes.</b> An inner grip is shaped to surround the support, and grips the natural <b>eyelashes</b> and the false <b>eyelashes.</b> An outer grip is shaped to surround the inner grip, further grips the natural <b>eyelashes</b> and the false <b>eyelashes</b> that are gripped by the inner grip, and applies heat to the adhesive contained in the false <b>eyelashes.</b> A manipulating portion is slidably coupled to an exterior of the body and moved to sequentially operate the inner grip and the outer grip. open[URL]...|$|R
50|$|The ideal eyes, {{from the}} Roman perspective, were large with long <b>eyelashes.</b> Pliny the Elder wrote that <b>eyelashes</b> fell out from {{excessive}} sex {{and so it}} was especially important for women to keep their <b>eyelashes</b> long to prove their chastity.|$|R
50|$|Many {{people use}} {{cosmetic}} treatments {{to cover the}} loss of the hair, such as applying artificial <b>eyelashes,</b> tattooing eyebrows/eyelashes, penciling in the eyebrows or using mascara to make the existing <b>eyelashes</b> look longer. Some people even use eyeliner to make the eye stand out when lacking <b>eyelashes.</b>|$|R
25|$|Distichia (including ectopic cilia) is an <b>eyelash</b> {{that arises}} from an {{abnormal}} {{spot on the}} eyelid. Distichiae usually cause no symptoms because the lashes are soft, but they can irritate the eye and cause tearing, squinting, inflammation, and corneal ulcers.|$|E
25|$|<b>Eyelash</b> vipers {{have not}} been {{evaluated}} by the IUCN Red List, and were removed from CITES Appendix III in 2002. While not listed as threatened, they are likely at risk of habitat loss from increased deforestation for timber, agriculture, and urbanization.|$|E
25|$|It {{is used in}} eye hygiene {{to treat}} blepharitis. This is done by {{addition}} of a teaspoon of sodium bicarbonate to cool water that was recently boiled, followed by gentle scrubbing of the <b>eyelash</b> base with a cotton swab dipped in the solution.|$|E
50|$|Following {{the success}} of her beauty blog, Amanda {{has gone on to}} create her own line of false <b>eyelashes.</b> Currently {{retailing}} on www.koshkacosmetics.com, Amanda created her line of false <b>eyelashes</b> as she was inspired by how false <b>eyelashes</b> instantly brighten up and add dimension to one's face. She wanted women to look like the best versions of themselves with natural-looking false <b>eyelashes</b> instead of wearing heavy eye makeup which can alter one's appearance. A favourite amongst models, beauty queens, beauty bloggers, and makeup artistes, Koshka Cosmetics false <b>eyelashes</b> have been spotted on many celebrities including Miss Universe Malaysia 2012, Kimberley Leggett, and Swedish top model, Jasmine Sjöberg Sidibé, of Sweden's Next Top Model (cycle 6).|$|R
5000|$|Madarosis is a {{condition}} that results {{in the loss of}} <b>eyelashes,</b> sometimes eyebrow. The term [...] "madarosis" [...] is Greek for the word [...] "madao" [...] which means [...] "to fall off." [...] It originally was a disease of only losing <b>eyelashes</b> but it currently is the loss of both <b>eyelashes</b> and eyebrows. Eyebrows and <b>eyelashes</b> are both important in the prevention of bacteria and other foreign objects from entering the eye. A majority of patients with madarosis have leprosy, and it was reported that 76% of patients with varying types of leprosy had madarosis.|$|R
50|$|Standard {{treatment}} involves removal or {{destruction of}} the affected <b>eyelashes</b> with electrology, specialized laser, or surgery. In many cases, removal of the affected <b>eyelashes</b> with forceps resolves the symptoms, although the problem often recurs {{in a few weeks}} when the <b>eyelashes</b> regrow. Severe cases may cause scarring of the cornea and lead to vision loss if untreated. Mild cases may not require treatment.|$|R
25|$|Some {{authorities}} {{also recognize}} a montane form that is treated {{either as a}} subspecies (B. s. supraciliaris) or as a species (B. supraciliaris). Found {{in the province of}} San José in Costa Rica, it was sometimes referred to as the <b>eyelash</b> mountain viper, while more recent publications recognizing the species designation refer to it as the blotched palm-pitviper.|$|E
25|$|Bothriechis schlegelii, the <b>eyelash</b> viper, is a venomous pit viper species {{found in}} Central and South America. Small and arboreal, this species is {{characterized}} by a wide array of color variations, as well as the superciliary scales above the eyes. It is the most common of the green palm-pitvipers (genus Bothriechis), and is often present in zoological exhibits. The specific name schlegelii honors Hermann Schlegel, who was a German ornithologist and herpetologist. For other common names see below. No subspecies are currently recognized.|$|E
25|$|Shu Uemura {{sold his}} {{controlling}} {{interest in his}} company to French cosmetics maker L'Oréal in 2004 for an undisclosed amount of money. However, he remained the creative force behind Shu Uemura Cosmetics after the sale. It was estimated that as of early 2008, Shu Uemura Cosmetics made approximately $100 {{million a year in}} global sales at its stores worldwide. At the time of his death, the company had stores in Paris, New York City, London and Hong Kong, as well as outlets throughout Japan. The company's product line has expanded over the years to include hair and lifestyle products, perfume, fake eyelashes and handmade makeup brushes. In the process, the Uemura's company became a cultural force in some circles. Shu Uemura's <b>eyelash</b> curlers were even mentioned in the 2006 film, The Devil Wears Prada.|$|E
5000|$|Staphylococcal {{blepharitis}} {{is caused}} by infection of the anterior portion of the eyelid by Staphylococcal bacteria. Symptoms include a foreign body sensation, matting of the lashes, and burning. Collarette around <b>eyelashes,</b> a ring-like formation around the lash shaft, can be observed. Other symptoms include loss of <b>eyelashes</b> or broken <b>eyelashes.</b> [...] The condition can sometimes lead to a chalazion or a stye.|$|R
50|$|Blepharitis is the {{irritation}} of the lid margin, where <b>eyelashes</b> {{join the}} eyelid. The eyelids are red and itching, the skin often becomes flaky, and the <b>eyelashes</b> may fall out.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{explore the}} {{characteristics}} of susceptibility weighted imaging (SWI) of the intrav-itreous foreign body of autologous <b>eyelashes</b> in rabbits. MethodsA total of 12 New Zealand white rabbits, either sex, weighing 2. 5 – 3. 5 kg, and provided by the Experimental Animal Center of Henan Province were employed in this study. For each rabbit, 5 autologous <b>eyelashes</b> (1 cm in length and 0. 2 – 0. 3 mm in diameter) were implanted into the right ocular vitreum, while the left control ocular vitreum received sham operation but nothing was implanted. SWI sequential test was made 2 hours postoperatively. Then the rabbits were killed and the specimens of the vitreous bodies of the rabbits were obtained. Hematoxylin and eosin staining and histological examinations were performed. ResultsThe autologous <b>eyelashes</b> in 8 ocular vitreums of rabbits showed linear low signal intensity on the magnitude images and susceptibility weighted images, but linear high signal intensity on the phase images. Among the 12 experimental rabbits, 5 <b>eyelashes</b> in the right vitreum were completely shown in 3 rabbits, partly shown in 5 rabbits (2 <b>eyelashes</b> shown in 3 rabbits and 3 <b>eyelashes</b> shown in 2 rabbits), and not shown in 4 rabbits. ConclusionSWI of the foreign body of intravitreous autologous <b>eyelashes</b> in rabbits has its own characteristics. The combined application of SWI sequential magnitude images, susceptibility weighted images and phase images is helpful to the detection and diagnosis of intravitreous autologous <b>eyelashes</b> in rabbits...|$|R
25|$|The modern {{field of}} {{statistics}} {{emerged in the}} late 19th and early 20th century in three stages. The first wave, {{at the turn of}} the century, was led by the work of Francis Galton and Karl Pearson, who transformed statistics into a rigorous mathematical discipline used for analysis, not just in science, but in industry and politics as well. Galton's contributions included introducing the concepts of standard deviation, correlation, regression analysis and the application of these methods to the study of the variety of human characteristics – height, weight, <b>eyelash</b> length among others. Pearson developed the Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient, defined as a product-moment, the method of moments for the fitting of distributions to samples and the Pearson distribution, among many other things. Galton and Pearson founded Biometrika as the first journal of mathematical statistics and biostatistics (then called biometry), and the latter founded the world's first university statistics department at University College London.|$|E
25|$|Tropical Discovery {{was opened}} in 1993. The {{building}} explores several tropical environments and displays mammals, reptiles, fish, amphibians and insects from these areas. The trip {{begins with a}} view into a South American river with different species of freshwater stingray then continues to a cave where guests are immersed within the community of several bat species including the vampire bat. A snake exhibit hidden inside a Mayan temple features several venomous species including the king cobra and <b>eyelash</b> viper. Other South American animals here include capybara, black howler monkey, arapaima, piranha and poison dart frog. Further on, visitors are immersed in a coral reef with epaulette sharks, clownfish, yellow tang, lionfish and garden eels. Around the corner, a gallery of North American snakes is located across from alligator snapping turtle and other North American reptiles and fish in a large pool. Further on, Siamese crocodile lurk in their pool amongst other swamp species like mata mata. The Komodo dragon exhibit was the largest of its kind at opening and {{is still one of}} the largest Komodo dragon exhibits in the country.|$|E
500|$|S.scutellata {{was first}} {{described}} in 1753 by Carl Linnaeus {{in his book}} Species Plantarum as Peziza scutellata, and it was given its current name by Jean Baptiste Émil Lambotte in Memoires societe royale des sciences de Liege in 1887. It was also named Patella scutellata in 1902. The specific name scutellata is from the Latin for [...] "like a small shield". Common names include the <b>eyelash</b> fungus, the <b>eyelash</b> cup, the scarlet elf cap, the Molly eye-winker and the <b>eyelash</b> pixie cup.|$|E
30|$|The {{detected}} {{eye sockets}} contain eyeball, eye brow, and <b>eyelashes</b> together. However; {{in most of}} the intensity-based trackers, eye brows and <b>eyelashes</b> are described as an obstacle for robust eyeball detection. It is physically known that pupil is the darkest contour in an eye-socket; however, eye brows and <b>eyelashes</b> are also dark and have similar intensity values with pupil. This makes everything difficult and prevents developing robust eye tracking systems.|$|R
50|$|Blinking also {{protects the}} eye from irritants. <b>Eyelashes</b> are hairs {{attached}} to {{the upper and lower}} eyelids that create a line of defense against dust and other elements to the eye. The <b>eyelashes</b> catch most of these irritants before they reach the eyeball.|$|R

500|$|Scutellinia scutellata, {{commonly}} known as the <b>eyelash</b> cup, the Molly eye-winker, the scarlet elf cap, the <b>eyelash</b> fungus or the <b>eyelash</b> pixie cup, is a small saprophytic fungus of the genus Scutellinia. It is the type species of Scutellinia, as well as being the most common and widespread. The fruiting bodies are small red cups with distinct long, dark hairs or [...] "eyelashes". These eyelashes are the most distinctive feature and are easily visible with a magnifying glass. The species is common in North America and Europe, and has been recorded on every continent. S.scutellata is found on rotting wood and in other damp habitats, typically growing in small groups, sometimes forming clusters. It is sometimes described as inedible, but its small size means it is not suitable for culinary use. Despite this, it is popular among mushroom hunters due to its unusual [...] "eyelash" [...] hairs, making it memorable and easy to identify.|$|E
500|$|Snake {{scales are}} of {{different}} shapes and sizes. [...] Snake scales may be granular, have a smooth surface {{or have a}} longitudinal ridge or keel on it.
