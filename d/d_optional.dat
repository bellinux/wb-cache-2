40|$|Added {{equation}} (108) International audienceSpeech enhancement {{and separation}} are core problems in audio signal processing, with commercial applications in devices {{as diverse as}} mobile phones, conference call systems, hands-free systems, or hearing aids. In addition, they are crucial pre-processing steps for noise-robust automatic speech and speaker recognition. Many devices now have two to eight microphones. The enhancement and separation capabilities offered by these multichannel interfaces are usually greater than those of single-channel interfaces. Research in speech enhancement and separation has followed two convergent paths, starting with microphone array processing and blind source separation, respectively. These communities are now strongly interrelated and routinely borrow ideas from each other. Yet, a comprehensive overview of the common foundations and the differences between these approaches is lacking at present. In this article, we propose to fill this gap by analyzing {{a large number of}} established and recent techniques according to four transverse axes: a) the acoustic impulse response model, b) the spatial filter design criterion, c) the parameter estimation algorithm, and <b>d)</b> <b>optional</b> postfiltering.

40|$|From {{the point}} of view of a {{material}} scientist, easel paintings can be considered as extended and complex multilayered objects, where a variety of materials of different density and physico-chemical properties is applied on top of each other in various layers. When a painting contains only one pictorial (i. e., visual information carrying) layer, the number of strata can be limited to three or four, i. e., (a) the substrate material (e. g., canvas, wood or metal), (b) a ground layer (e. g., a glue-chalk mixture or a glue-gypsum base), (c) the actual pictorial layer and (<b>d)</b> an <b>optional</b> varnish layer. In many paintings, the pictorial layer itself is composed of more than one superimposed level in order to achieve an particular optical effect or because the artists altered or corrected his own design while first creating the work. Quite a few paintings also contain more than one pictorial layer; this is the case for paintings that, immediately upon their creation or several years/decades afterwards, were painted over to re-use the canvas or panel. Usually it concerns paintings from the early (or earlier) period of a painter with which the artist grew dissatisfied in later stages of his career so that a new set of ground+pictorial layers were used to cover up the layers already present. For these reasons, many contemporary art-historians, on the other hand, are interested to obtain information on the covered-up paintings...|$|R

Belmont This {{protocol}} {{was adapted from}} “Development of Mammalian Cell Lines with lac Operator-Tagged Chromosomes,” Chapter 25, in[*Live Cell Imaging*]([URL] Goldman and Spector). Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, USA, 2005. ### INTRODUCTION The discovery and use of fluorescent proteins to label chromosomal proteins has yielded basic structural information as well as insights into dynamics that were previously inaccessible. This protocol describes a method for tagging specific chromosome sites using the *lac* operator/repressor system, wherein direct repeats of bacterial operator sequences are coupled with green fluorescent protein (GFP) -tagged proteins that recognize these sequences. Direct *lac* operator repeats are generated by directional cloning. Although the use of direct repeats, as opposed to inverted repeats, reduces recombination within the bacterial host at high copy number, even the direct repeats are unstable, requiring the use of special bacterial hosts and low-copy-number plasmids for cloning. The introduction of the *lac* operator repeats into eukaryotic cells uses traditional transformation methods. Techniques for the isolation of stable cell clones with varying transgene copy numbers are described in the protocol, as are several methods for visual screening {{of large numbers of}} stable cell clones to isolate rare clones containing labeled chromosomal regions with desired features. ### RELATED INFORMATION In principle, chromosome tagging can be accomplished through the use of any repetitive sequence to which a specific protein binds. The first application of this approach used the bacterial lac operator and Lac repressor combination. The lac operator/Lac repressor-labeling system has been successfully adapted for tagging chromatin in live bacteria, yeast, and mammalian tissue culture cells (Fig. 1), as well as in multicellular organisms including *Caenorhabditis elegans*, *Drosophila*, and *Arabidopsis*. Subsequent approaches have used tet operator or glucocorticoid receptor element repeats. Recently, the lac operator system has been used in combination with the bacteriophage viral replicase translational operator and several color variants of GFP to label DNA, RNA, and protein in living cells. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1. ** Examples of different stable cell lines with lac operator-tagged chromosome regions visualized by GFP-Lac repressor in vivo expression.

Dry ice - Equipment for agarose gel electrophoresis - Filter paper - Flasks (25 -cm 2 tissue culture; 75 -cm 2) - Fluorescence-activated cell sorter - Forceps (sharp-tipped) - Incubator preset to 30 °C - Inoculation loops - Marker (permanent) - Microcentrifuge - Microcentrifuge tubes (1. 5 mL) - Micropipette tips (sterile 200 -μL) (1 mL) (optional; see Step 8. viii) - Microscope - Petri dishes (150 -mm) - Pipette - Plastic hose (optional; see Step 8. viii) - Plates for growing bacterial cultures - Plates (96 -well) - Shaking platform - Tubes for transfection ### METHOD **Preparing Vector DNA Containing Large Direct Repeats** 1. Clone the lac operator repeat into a vector. - *This protocol is based on preparations from our laboratory using the pSV 2 -DHFR- 8. 32 plasmid containing a 256 -copy lac operator repeat*. - i. Use Stbl 2 competent cells grown at 30 °C to help maintain full-length lac operator repeats. - ii. Clone the lac operator repeats into low-copy-number vectors (e. g., psv 2 -DHFR- 8. 32). - *Having too many copies in a cell increases the possibility of recombination*. - Purify vector DNA as follows: - The purification of vector DNA should take no more than 3 d to complete (4 <b>d</b> if the <b>optional</b> second minipreps are performed in Step 2. viii). Recombination may occur if plates or cultures from Step 1 are allowed to stand at 4 °C; thus it is important to complete this procedure without delay. However, the plasmid DNA, once prepared from the cells, is stable. Because low-copy-number plasmids are used, expect low yields at every purification step. - i. Streak bacteria from a stab culture onto an LB plate containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL). Store the stab culture in the dark at room temperature. - ii. Incubate the inoculated LB plate for 24 h at 30 °C. - *Even after this length of time, the colonies will be small*. - iii. Inoculate at least 10 3 -mL cultures of LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) with well-isolated colonies. Incubate the cultures on a shaker overnight at 30 °C. - iv. Prepare DNA using a miniprep procedure (e. g., QIAGEN) from 1. 5 mL of each culture. Store the remainder of each culture at 4 °C. - v. Digest aliquots of the DNA with SalI and XhoI. Separate the DNA fragments on an agarose gel (0. 7 %). - *At this step, it is critical to be very discerning. Any bands present other than those expected could indicate recombination of the plasmid (in the case of the pSV 2 -DHFR- 8. 32 plasmid containing a 256 -copy lac operator repeat, expect 10 -kb and 5 -kb fragments) *. - vi. Prepare and freeze a glycerol stock, or prepare a stab culture of each positive clone (from the stored cultures in Step 2. iv). - vii. Inoculate 500 mL of LB containing ampicillin (100 μg/mL) with the remaining culture from one of the positive clones. Incubate the culture overnight at 30 °C with shaking. - *It may be preferable to prepare two 500 -mL cultures, each from a different positive clone, in the event that one clone is lost during large-scale growth*. - viii. (Optional) Before proceeding with the maxiprep DNA isolation, isolate DNA from an aliquot of the 500 -mL culture by repeating Steps 2. iv- 2. v. While preparing the miniprep DNA, centrifuge the 500 -mL culture. Discard the supernatant, and freeze the bacterial pellet until ready to use. Use positive cultures for the following step: - ix. Isolate DNA from the 500 -mL culture using a maxiprep procedure. If using QIAGEN maxipreps with Qiafilters, double the volume of P 1, P 2, and P 3 added to each pellet, and then split the prep into two Qiafilters. This prevents the Qiafilter from clogging. - *The yield of DNA will be low. A good yield is ~ 125 μg of DNA per 500 -mL culture*. - x. Digest aliquots of the DNA with SalI and XhoI to confirm that only DNA fragments of the expected size are present. **Making Stable Cell Lines Containing lac Operator Repeats** 3. Grow cells for transfection for ~ 1 wk. - *CHO DG 44 cells are derivatives of CHO K 1 cells and are doubly deleted for the DHFR locus. The product of the DHFR gene is necessary for intermediary metabolism of thymidylates and purines. An imbalance of nucleotides in cells may be the cause of both insert instability due to gene amplification and an abnormal cell cycle due to interference with replication timing*. 4. Purify plasmid DNA for transfection as follows: - i. Transfer 300 μL of vector DNA solution (~ 100 μg/mL) into a 1. 5 -mL microcentrifuge tube. - ii. Add 33 μL of sodium acetate (3 M, pH 5. 5) to the DNA, and thoroughly mix the solution with a pipette. - iii. Add 660 μL of ice-cold 100 % ethanol to the tube, and mix the contents by inverting the tube several times. Let the tube stand on dry ice for 5 min. - *At this step, white fibers of DNA precipitate should be visible*. - iv. Centrifuge the reaction in a microcentrifuge at 14, 000 rpm for 15 min at 4 °C. For convenience, label the location of the pellet inside the tube with a permanent marker. - v. Remove the supernatant, and wash the pellet with 1 mL of 70 % ethanol at 4 °C by inverting the tube several times. Centrifuge the tube in a microcentrifuge at 14, 000|$|R

Recently a new model of the reflection effect, dust and Mie scattering were incorporated into the code. ϵ Aurigae is one of the most mysterious objects on the sky. Prior modeling of its light-curve assumed dark, inclined, disk of dust with the central hole to explain the light-curve with a sharp mid-eclipse brightening. Our model consists of two geometrically thick flared disks. Internal optically thick disk and external optically thin disk which absorbs and scatters radiation. Shallow mid-eclipse brightening may result from eclipses by nearly edge-on flared (dusty or gaseous) disks. Mid-eclipse brightening may also be due to strong forward scattering and optical properties of the dust which can have an important effect on the light-curves. There are many similarities between interacting binary stars and transiting extrasolar planets. Reflection effect which is briefly reviewed is one of them. The exact Roche shape and temperature distributions over the surface of all currently known transiting extrasolar planets have been determined. In some cases (HAT-P- 32 b, WASP- 12 b, WASP- 19 b) departures from the spherical shape can reach 7 - 15...|$|E
