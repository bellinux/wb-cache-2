2500|$|Harlow {{was well}} known for refusing to use {{conventional}} terminology, instead choosing deliberately outrageous terms for the experimental apparatus he devised. This came from an early conflict with the conventional psychological establishment in which Harlow used the term [...] "love" [...] {{in place of the}} popular and archaically correct term, [...] "attachment". Such terms and respective devices included a forced-mating device he called the [...] "rape rack", tormenting surrogate-mother devices he called [...] "Iron maidens", and an <b>isolation</b> <b>chamber</b> he called the [...] "pit of despair", developed by him and a graduate student, Stephen Suomi.|$|E

25|$|Beginning in 1959, Harlow and his {{students}} began publishing their observations {{on the effects of}} partial and total social isolation.

40|$|Abstract – Vibration causes {{mechanical}} distortions in fiber-optic {{transmission lines}} that induce time (phase) fluctuations. RF systems are increasingly using optical fibers {{in various ways}} and must occasionally operate in environments with acoustic and structure-born vibration. A scheme is described which enables electronic suppression and cancellation of vibration-induced spurious phase noise in an optical fiber wound on a spool. The scheme is applied to an opto-electronic oscillator (OEO). Close-to-carrier spectral lines often occur due to mechanical vibration of state-of-the-art oscillators. Passive vibration-suppression schemes (shock mounts, <b>isolation</b> <b>chambers,</b> etc.) do not always adequately reduce discrete line spectra that originate from vibration effects. However, vibration can be readily detected and measured by use of accelerometers. One can correct for these low-frequenc...|$|R

The box falls to the ground, and the other technician calls for an emergency alert. The box is put in an <b>isolation</b> <b>chamber.</b> As the scientists are discussing what could possibly have happened to the technician, there is a bright flash in the <b>isolation</b> <b>chamber,</b> and suddenly Simmons is back again, but the box is gone.

50|$|In 1960, Harry Harlow began {{studying}} partial and total isolation of infant monkeys by raising them in cages. Partial isolation involved raising monkeys in bare wire cages {{that allowed them}} to see, smell, and hear other monkeys, but did not give them the opportunity for physical contact. Total social isolation involved rearing monkeys in <b>isolation</b> <b>chambers</b> that took away any and all contact with other monkeys. The results showed that when the monkeys were placed in partial isolation they displayed various abnormal behaviors such as blank staring, circling in their cages numerous times, and self-mutilation. The cages were placed in several locations. A few of the monkeys remained being tested in solitary confinement for fifteen years.|$|R
50|$|Georg von Békésy {{demonstrated}} physiologically {{that different}} frequencies of sound stimulated {{different regions of}} the cochlea (Wilson 2004). Based upon the findings of Békésy, Greenwood placed four students under the age of 29 with presumably healthy cochleas in <b>isolation</b> <b>chambers</b> and introduced pure tones within the range of audible frequencies (20-20,000 Hz). Upon application of each tone, he then introduced a second pure tone of the same frequency and then raised and lowered the frequency until it was sufficiently different from the original frequency to become audible (Greenwood 1961a). Subjects responded with a handheld device allowing Greenwood to record exactly at what frequency interval the two pitches were audible and distinct. Experiments were performed over the entire range of audible frequencies (Greenwood 1961a).|$|R

This is sufficiently low to be undetectable (a person sitting in a bathtub full of water is exposed to greater pressures) to operators working inside the enclosure, but due to the leaky nature of the unit, ensures that the volume of air inside is constantly and rapidly changing.

40|$|The papers {{presented}} in this section describe changes in behavior and performance in various isolated and confined extreme (ICE) environments, including Antarctic expeditions and research stations, space simulators and <b>isolation</b> <b>chambers,</b> and submarines. Each of these environments possesses characteristics that are in some way analogous to those found on long-duration space missions. Despite differences in length of mission, characteristics of mission personnel or crew, and characteristics in the physical environment, the various ICE environments described in this collection of papers appear to produce similar changes in behavior and performance. These changes include increased disturbances of mood, increased rates of psychiatric disorder, increased interpersonal tension, and a disruption of circadian rhythms. However, these environments do not inherently produce decrements in performance. Palinkas and colleagues suggest that prolonged exposure to the isolation and confinement in the Antarctic can actually have positive or "salutogenic" effects as well, evidenced by a decrease in mood disturbances and increase in performance measures...|$|R
25|$|Harlow's {{experiments}} were controversial; they included creating inanimate surrogate mothers for the rhesus infants from wire and wood. Each infant became attached to its particular mother, recognizing its unique face and preferring it above all others. Harlow next chose to investigate if the infants had {{a preference for}} bare-wire mothers or cloth-covered mothers. For this experiment, he presented the infants with a clothed mother and a wire mother under two conditions. In one situation, the wire mother held a bottle with food, and the cloth mother held no food. In the other situation, the cloth mother held the bottle, and the wire mother had nothing. Also later in his career, he cultivated infant monkeys in <b>isolation</b> <b>chambers</b> for up to 24 months, from which they emerged intensely disturbed. Some researchers cite the experiments {{as a factor in}} the rise of the animal liberation movement in the United States. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Harlow as the 26th most cited psychologist of the 20th century.|$|R

40|$|The {{modulation}} of angiogenic {{processes in}} matrices {{is of great}} interest in tissue engineering. We assessed the angiogenic effects of fibrin-immobilized VEGF and bFGF in an arteriovenous loop (AVL) model in 22 AVLs created between the femoral artery and vein in rats. The loops were placed in <b>isolation</b> <b>chambers</b> and were embedded in 500 μL fibrin gel (FG) (group A) or in 500 μL FG loaded with 0. 1 ng/μL VEGF and 0. 1 ng/μL bFGF (group B). After two and four weeks specimens were explanted and investigated using histological, morphometrical, and ultramorphological [scanning electron microscope (SEM) of vascular corrosion replicas] techniques. In both groups, the AVL induced formation of densely vascularized connective tissue with differentiated and functional vessels inside the fibrin matrix. VEGF and bFGF induced significantly higher absolute and relative vascular density and a faster resorption of the fibrin matrix. SEM analysis in both groups revealed characteristics of an immature vascular bed, with a higher vascular density in group B.

Ten-minute resolution actograms were constructed from {{data obtained by}} an automated acquisition system. After two months of habituation to a stable light-dark schedule, recordings were performed in <b>isolation</b> <b>chambers</b> under a 12 : 12 Light Dark schedule. A free-running period (constant darkness) was recorded for O. bridgesi and S. cyanus. O. degus displayed a crepuscular pattern of rest activity rhythm. Entrained O. bridgesi and S. cyanus displayed nocturnal preference, with rest anticipating light phase and without crepuscular activity bouts. Under constant darkness, active phase occurred at subjective night in O. bridgesi and S. cyanus. Wild-captured O. bridgesi and S. cyanus possess a circadian driven nocturnal preference, while wild O. degus displays a crepuscular profile. Diurnal active phase preference of wild S. cyanus colonies observed in the field could not be explained solely by photic entrainment, since social and/or masking processes appear to be operative.

The activity of O. degus observed during the dark phase was enhanced when wheel-running was allowed. No significant change in phase preference was observed for O. bridgesi when wheel-running was allowed. A lengthening of endogenous period was observed in O. bridgesi after wheel-running exposure under constant darkness.
