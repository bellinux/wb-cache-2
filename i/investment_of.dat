5|$|Developed in the 2000s at an <b>investment</b> <b>of</b> US$2 million after IDF {{commitments}} for 1,200 units, some AIL {{jobs were}} believed to be in jeopardy following a mid-2005 announcement that the IDF would purchase 100 US sold Land Rover Defender-based MDT David. The announcement provoked threats of protests from AIL's management and labourers, who had recently faced the blow of local Humvee assembly ceasing due to budget considerations. The MDT David was chosen over the armoured version of the Storm because the heavy Storm was said to suffer from handling and reliability problems, safety hazards and limited mission operability. However the IDF said that the purchase of the David was to fill a temporary gap in production until the Storm II's testing was completed, and has since begun filling its commitment.|$|E
30|$|Figure  1 {{presents}} the percentage {{change in the}} <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> the government, households, and {{rest of the world}} from the benchmark. It is obvious from the figure that the <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> the government and households were positive, whereas the <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> {{the rest of the world}} were negative. This implies that after the simulation, the <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> government and households increased continuously, whereas the <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> the rest of the world declined. It is important to note that the investments here represented both real and financial investments. Moreover, the figure shows that change in government investments was considerably greater than the change in investments by households. This result was expected because the ECB’s action assumed the government would increase its expenditure after receiving money from the bank’s bond purchases. Therefore, the percentage change in the level <b>of</b> government <b>investments</b> was greater than the change in household investments.|$|R

5|$|Following a {{successful}} campaign in Extremadura, on 27 January 1811 Soult began his <b>investment</b> <b>of</b> Badajoz. Almost immediately the Spanish Army of Extremadura {{arrived in the}} vicinity with some 15,000 troops {{under the command of}} Gen. Mendizabal. Soult's army, too small to surround Badajoz, was unable to prevent 3,000 of Mendizabal's men from reinforcing the fortress and the remainder occupying the heights of San Cristóbal. This posed a major threat to the French, so Soult moved at once to engage. In the ensuing Battle of the Gebora the French inflicted 1,000 casualties on the Spanish field army and took 4,000 prisoners, at a cost to themselves of only 400 casualties. The remnants of Mendizabal's defeated army fled towards Badajoz or into Portugal.|$|E

Using a novel dataset of private firms from the Netherlands for the period of 2004 – 2012 and controlling for major firm-specific variables, we find that the <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> Dutch SMEs suffered a significant decline during the financial crisis. We also find that both internal and external financing have significant positive relationships with the <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> SMEs during the pre-crisis as well as the crisis periods. However, these two financing sources exhibit no differential impact during the crisis. The findings of the study lend some relief to those practitioners and policymakers who are concerned that the contraction in bank lending during the economic crisis has a differential damaging impact on the <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> SMEs...|$|R

In 1902, majority ownership passed to the four local businessmen who invested £500 to save the club from bankruptcy, including future club president John Henry Davies. After his death in 1927, the club faced bankruptcy yet again, but was saved in December 1931 by James W. Gibson, who assumed control of the club after an <b>investment</b> <b>of</b> £2,000.
