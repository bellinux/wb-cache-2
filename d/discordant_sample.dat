40|$|One of {{the core}} {{behavioral}} features associated with obsessive compulsive symptomatology is the inability to inhibit thoughts and/or behaviors. Neuroimaging studies have indicated abnormalities in frontostriatal and dorsolateral prefrontal - anterior cingulate circuits during inhibitory control in patients with obsessive compulsive disorder compared with controls. In the present study, task performance and brain activation during Stroop color-word and Flanker interference were compared within monozygotic twin pairs discordant for obsessive compulsive symptoms and between groups of pairs scoring very low or very high on obsessive compulsive symptoms, {{in order to examine}} the differential impact of non-shared environmental versus genetic risk factors for obsessive compulsive symptomatology on inhibitory control related functional brain activation. Although performance was intact, brain activation during inhibition of distracting information differed between obsessive compulsive symptom high-scoring compared to low-scoring subjects. Regions affected in the discordant group (e. g., temporal and anterior cingulate gyrus) were partly different from those observed to be affected in the concordant groups (e. g., parietal gyrus and thalamus). A robust increase in dorsolateral prefrontal activity during response interference was observed in both the high-scoring twins of the <b>discordant</b> <b>sample</b> and the high-scoring twins of the concordant sample, marking this structure as a possible key region for disturbances in inhibitory control in obsessive compulsive disorder. © The Authors 2012...|$|E
40|$|This study {{aimed to}} compare three {{staining}} methods including: Calcofluor white, Chromotrope and Quick Hot Gram chromotrope used in diagnosis of intestinal microsporidial spores. One hundred and seventy five stool specimens {{were collected from}} patients referred to Laboratory of Intestinal Protozoology at the School of Public Health, Tehran University of Medical Sciences during 2012 - 2013. All of specimens were evaluated by nested PCR. The formalin-fixed stool samples were prepared from each specimen and dried {{at room temperature for}} 10 min, followed by 10 min methanol fixation. All the collected stool samples were evaluated blindly by calcofluor white, Chromotrope and Quick Hot Gram chromotrope staining methods separately. Microsporidial spores were recognized using Chromotrope, Quick Hot Gram chromotrope and Calcofluor white, in 16 of 18 (88. 8 %), 17 of 18 (94. 4 %) and 18 of 18 (100 %) samples that were positive by nested PCR respectively.

40|$|Diagnosis of yeast {{infection}} is typically accomplished by fungal smear and culture, histopathologic examination, and/or sero-logic studies. Newer assays based onmass spectrometry {{may be useful}} for yeast identification when histologic examination is inconclusive, fungal cultures are not ordered, or cultures fail to yield a causative agent. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate the ability of the PLEX-ID broad fungal assay to accurately detect and identify yeasts in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. Tissue samples from 78 FFPE specimens with both histopathology and corresponding culture results for a variety of yeasts were tested using the PLEX-ID broad fungal assay. A 40 -mFFPE tissue section from each specimen was digested with proteinase K followed by nucleic acid extraction and PCR using broad-range fungal primers. Yeast DNA in amplified products was identified using electrospray ionizationmass spectrometry. Discordant results were resolved by D 2 rRNA gene sequencing. PLEX-ID analysis detected yeast DNA in 78. 2 % (61 / 78) of the cases, of which 91. 8 % (56 / 61) were concordant with culture results. Of the 5 discordant positive results, 4 PLEX-ID results were considered to result from environmental contaminants, while 1 clin-ically important discrepancy was observed (Blastomyces dermatitidis by culture and Cryptococcus neoformans by PLEX-ID). Sequencing of the <b>discordant</b> <b>sample</b> was unsuccessful. The majority of histopathology results (89. 7 % [70 / 78]) correlated with culture results.

40|$|BackgroundWe {{previously}} detected Helicobacter pylori infection by stool antigen ELISA assay in 33 - 41 % of asymptomatic Chilean {{children between}} 2 - 3 years of age, of which 11 - 20 % had a transient infection and 21 - 22 % a persistent infection. A total of 88 % of ELISA-positive samples were also rtPCR positive, while 37 / 133 (33 %) of ELISA-negative stool samples were rtPCR positive. The {{significance of a}} ELISA-negative/rtPCR-positive sample requires clarification. We aimed to determine whether rtPCR is able to detect persistent infections not detected by ELISA. Materials and MethodsWe selected 36 children with an ELISA-negative/rtPCR-positive stool sample, of which 25 were never H. pylori infected according to ELISA, and 11 had a transient infection with an ELISA-positive sample {{before or after the}} <b>discordant</b> <b>sample.</b> At least two additional consecutive ELISA-negative samples per child were tested in duplicate by rtPCR for the 16 s rRNA gene. ResultsA total of 14 of 78 (17. 9 %) rtPCR reactions were positive, but only 4 / 78 (5. 1 %) were positive in both duplicates, representing a total of 3 / 36 (8. 3 %) children with an additional rtPCR-positive sample, only one of whom was persistently negative by ELISA. One child with a transient infection had two positive rtPCR reactions despite negative ELISA samples. ConclusionsIn H. pylori noninfected or transiently infected children, as determined by stool ELISA, additional ELISA-negative/rtPCR-positive stool samples were found in 8. 3 % of children, but a possible persistent infection was only identified in 2. 7 % of children. Thus, the characterization of infection dynamics in children is not being misrepresented by application of stool ELISA. Furthermore, rtPCR does not significantly improve dynamic characterization.

40|$|Viral {{genotype}} is {{an important}} determinant of the therapeutical outcome of the chronic hepatitis C and is useful in clinical practice to determine the duration of treatment 1. While the viral type shows a clear association with therapeutic success, there is currently no evidence to that effect for HCV subtype, whose value is thus confined to epidemiological studies. The Abbott RealTime HCV Genotype II assay, {{through the use of}} Minor Groove Binder probes (MGB) is able to distinguish genotypes 1 to 6 (target 5 ’-UTR region) and subtypes 1 a and 1 b (NS 5 B region). In four different Italian centers a comparison between the Abbott RealTime HCV Genotype II assay and the Versant HCV Genotype 2. 0 (LIPA) has been performed. A total of 143 non selected samples with the request of HCV genotyping have been analysed. 141 / 143 samples (98. 6 %) have provided reportable results with both tests (2 indeterminates with LIPA). Concordance at the type level was 96. 5 % (136 / 141). Considering the 136 concordant samples, the distribution was as follows: type 1 = 61 (44. 9 %), 2 = 36 (26. 5 %), 3 = 21 (15. 4 %), 4 = 17 (12. 5 %) 5 = 1 (0. 7 %). Both assays assigned subtype in 56 / 61 (91. 8 %) samples of genotype 1 (3 and 2 samples only provided the type for LIPA and Abbott, respectively) and 50 / 56 (89. 3 %) had concordant subtype. It is worth to note that 4 of the 5 samples with discordant subtype Abbott 1 a/LiPA 1 b came from the only center that used for LIPA the 5 -UTR amplicon, loosing the benefit of the core region which has been introduced in the version 2 of the test to improve the accuracy in distinguishing between 1 a and 1 b. There was only one <b>discordant</b> <b>sample</b> at type level (Abbott 4, LIPA 1 b) which after sequencing and phylogenetic analysis was resolved as type 4. Four mixed infections were detected, 3 with the Abbott test (two 1 a+ 4 and one 1 b+ 3) and 1 with the LIPA test (1 a+ 3). In all cases the comparison test showed a single genotype 1 infection. The new Abbott RealTime HCV Genotype II assay showed a high correlation with the Versant HCV Genotype 2. 0 assay (LIPA).

40|$|Detection ofHistoplasma capsulatum urinary antigen (UAg) is {{important}} for the initial diagnosis of infection and for monitor-ing of patient responses to antifungal therapy. This study evaluated an analyte-specific reagent (ASR) enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the detection ofH. capsulatumUAg from ImmunoMycologics, Inc. (IMMY) (Norman, OK) in comparison with rou-tine testing with the MiraVista (MVista) H. capsulatum quantitative EIA (MiraVista Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). Using pro-spectively collected urine specimens (n 1, 003), we observed an overall percent agreement between the two assays of 97. 6 % (979 / 1, 003 samples). Compared with theMVista EIA, the sensitivity and specificity of the IMMYASR EIA were 64. 5 % (40 / 62 samples) and 99. 8 % (939 / 941 samples), respectively, using a cutoff value of 0. 5 ng/ml. Based on available clinical histories for 23 / 24 <b>discordant</b> <b>samples,</b> 5 IMMY assay-negative/MVista assay-positive samples were considered falsely positive. Furthermore, 10 / 23 <b>discordant</b> <b>samples</b> were positive by theMVista EIA but were below the limit of quantitation (< 0. 4 ng/ml). The clinical significance of these low positive results in the MVista EIA is unclear. In addition to the prospective study, we tested 11 urine specimens collected from patients with culture-confirmedHistoplasma infections, and 100 % (11 / 11 samples) were positive by the IMMYASR EIA. In conclusion, the IMMYASR EIAmay offer an alternative approach for the detection ofHistoplasmaUAg. Additional prospective studies are needed to better characterize the performance of the IMMYASR EIA in conjunction with clin-ical and laboratory findings.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of performing genotypic tropism testing (GTT) with proviral DNA (pvDNA) even during suppressed viremia would facilitate {{the use of}} CCR 5 inhibitors as part of switching, simplification, or intensification strategies. Thus, we aimed to evaluate the tropism concordance between plasma RNA and pvDNA samples and to assess which factors could affect possible discrepancies between the two compartments. GTT was performed using both plasma RNA and pvDNA from 55 sample pairs from drug-experienced patients. Potential {{differences between the two}} compartments were evaluated by analyzing coreceptor usage and genetic variability. Paired samples were also stratified in three levels of viremia (500 copies/ml). Overall, Geno 2 Pheno comparisons of false-positive rates in the two compartments showed good correlation (r = 0. 72). A high level of concordance in tropism predictions for the two compartments was found (46 / 55 sample pairs [83. 6 %]). Among the 9 <b>sample</b> pairs with <b>discordant</b> tropisms, a larger proportion of pvDNA samples harboring CXCR 4 /dual-mixed-tropic viruses was found, in comparison with plasma RNA samples (88. 9 % versus 11. 1 %; P = 0. 0034). <b>Discordant</b> <b>samples</b> were characterized by greater genetic variability than were concordant samples. With stratification of the paired samples according to viremia levels, the prevalence of <b>discordant</b> <b>samples</b> decreased with increasing viremia (500 copies/ml, 6. 7 %; P = 0. 2).

Therefore, treatment guidelines recommend that patients initiating ABC are preventively tested {{for the presence of}} this allele. To date, four different commercial assays based on the real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (Q-PCR) technique are available for the detection of HLA-B* 57 : 01 : Duplicα-RealTime Reagent Set HLA-B* 57 : 01 by Euroclone, HLA-B* 57 : 01 Real-TM by Sacace Biotechnologies, COBAS AmpliPrep/COBAS TaqMan HLA-B* 57 : 01 Screening Test by Roche Diagnostic, and HLA-B* 57 : 01 by Nuclear Laser Medicine. The study was carried out to compare the performance of the first three commercially available Q-PCR kits in a routine clinical setting. A total of 98 samples from Policlinico Umberto I Hospital were tested. Results obtained by the Duplicα-RealTime Genotyping kit and AmpliPrep/TaqMan system were 100 % concordant. In contrast, genotyping by the HLA-B* 57 : 01 Real-TM kit showed poor agreement with the other systems, that is, 12 out of 33 positive samples were detected as HLA-B* 57 : 01 negative.

40|$|BACKGROUND Molecular {{biomarkers}} including {{isocitrate dehydrogenase}} 1 or 2 (IDH 1 / 2) mutation, 1 p/ 19 q codeletion, and O(6) -methylguanine-DNA-methyltransferase (MGMT) promoter methylation may improve prognostication and guide treatment decisions {{for patients with}} World Health Organization (WHO) anaplastic gliomas. At present, each marker is individually tested by distinct assays. Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation 450 BeadChip arrays (HM 450) enable the determination of large-scale methylation profiles and genome-wide DNA copy number changes. Algorithms {{have been developed to}} detect the glioma CpG island methylator phenotype (G-CIMP) associated with IDH 1 / 2 mutation, 1 p/ 19 q codeletion, and MGMT promoter methylation using a single assay. METHODS Here, we retrospectively investigated the diagnostic and prognostic performance of these algorithms in comparison to individual marker testing and patient outcome in the biomarker cohort (n = 115 patients) of the NOA- 04 trial. RESULTS Concordance for IDH and 1 p/ 19 q status was very high: In 92 % of samples, the HM 450 and reference data agreed. In <b>discordant</b> <b>samples,</b> survival analysis by Kaplan-Meier and Cox regression analyses suggested a more accurate assessment of biological phenotype by the HM 450 analysis. The HM 450 -derived MGMT-STP 27 model to calculate MGMT promoter methylation probability revealed this aberration in a significantly higher fraction of samples than conventional methylation-specific PCR, with 87 of 91 G-CIMP tumors predicted as MGMT promoter-methylated. Pyrosequencing of <b>discordant</b> <b>samples</b> confirmed the HM 450 assessment in 14 of 17 cases. CONCLUSIONS G-CIMP and 1 p/ 19 q codeletion are reliably detectable by HM 450 analysis and are associated with prognosis in the NOA- 04 trial. For MGMT, HM 450 suggests promoter methylation {{in the vast majority of}} G-CIMP tumors, which is supported by pyrosequencing...|$|R

The clinical significance of CSF/plasma discordance is not known and the degree of discordance considered important varies. We aimed to determine whether a panel of CSF cytokines, chemokines and associated mediators were raised in patients with CSF/plasma discordance at different levels. METHODS A nested case-control study of 40 CSF samples from the PARTITION study. We used a cytometric bead array to measure CSF mediator concentrations in 19 discordant and 21 non-discordant samples matched for plasma HIV- 1 RNA. <b>Discordant</b> <b>samples</b> were subdivided into 'high discordance' (> 1 log 10) and 'low discordance' (0. 5 - 1 log 10, or ultrasensitive discordance).

40|$|Measurement of feline {{coronavirus}} (FCoV) antibody titres is utilised {{mainly for}} diagnosing feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) and for quarantine purposes. However, occasional samples show a falsely low or negative FCoV antibody test. We tested {{the hypothesis that}} such results are due to virus in the sample binding antibody and rendering it unavailable to antigen in the test. Thirteen effusions, one plasma and three undefined samples from cats with FIP, which gave unexpectedly low FCoV antibody titres, were examined by real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Increasing amounts of virus correlated with lower signals in indirect immunoflourescent, enzyme-linked immunosorbent asssay and rapid immunomigration antibody tests. However, five samples were negative by RT-PCR, so the presence of virus alone may not explain all cases of false-negative FCoV antibody tests, although it is a possible explanation in 71 % of <b>discordant</b> <b>samples.</b> We conclude that falsely low or negative FCoV antibody tests can occur in samples rich in virus...|$|R

Genotyping of the reverse transcriptase (RT) and protease genes of HIV- 1 was undertaken using the fluorescent dideoxy-terminator method. Comparison of the amino acid sequence of the RT and protease genes in cell-associated variants of HIV- 1 with that of the plasma revealed that 62 of the 95 patients' samples tested exhibited different genotypic resistance patterns (<b>discordant</b> <b>samples</b> [DSs]). In 27 % of samples, the patterns of resistance detected were concordant in both compartments.

The HIV mutation patterns detected in plasma do not necessarily reflect those found in the cell-associated compartment. The observation that the cellular compartment may contain an archive of the resistance variant makes this reservoir an interesting substrate for analysis of the "resistance potential" in a given patient...|$|R
40|$|The {{usefulness}} of {{traditional methods of}} HIV plasma titration has been limited by poor detection capacity in the asymptomatic phase of HIV disease. We analyzed plasma samples from asymptomatic seropositive or early symptomatic patients, comparing the classic plasma culture method with the following techniques: phorbol 12 -myristate 13 -acetate treatment of target cells, centrifugal inoculation of the virus, heat treatment of cultures, addition of monocyte/macrophages to cultures, and polyethylene glycol (PEG) treatment of the plasma. Only PEG treatment significantly increased the percentage of HIV isolation. The increase of HIV isolation after PEG treatment is more evident in patients with higher CD 4 + cell counts and those without detectable levels of p 24 antigen. In the p 24 -negative samples, HIV was isolated in 17 of 24 (71 %) with PEG treatment versus nine of 24 (37 %) with the classic method (p < 0. 01). A number of <b>discordant</b> <b>samples</b> were found using the classic and PEG methods. Combining the positive results obtained with either technique, we obtained an overall HIV detection rate of 76 %. The increased sensitivity of the combination of PEG and classic methods may allow a wider use of plasma viremia {{as part of the}} virological evaluation of anti- HIV drug efficacy in asymptomatic patients...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Particularly for therapy-experienced patients, {{resistance}} assessment by genotypic or phenotypic methods produces discordances. This study seeks {{proof that}} differences {{may arise from}} the fact that genotyping produces a single summary sequence whereas replicative phenotyping (rPhenotyping) functionally detects and assigns resistances in mixed HIV populations. METHODS: For validation, defined mixes of wild-type and M 184 V mutant were analysed by rPhenotyping or standard genotyping. Allele-specific and quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) set detection and quantification limits for minor virus populations in vitro and in authentic clinical samples showing geno-/pheno-discrepant lamivudine resistance. RESULTS: Allele-specific and real-time PCR methods detected down to 0. 3 % of mutant M 184 V. The functional assessment was sensitive enough to reveal > 1 % of mutant M 184 V in mixed <b>samples.</b> Also in <b>discordant</b> <b>samples</b> from the diagnostic routine, in which rPhenotyping had identified drug resistance, real-time PCR confirmed minute amounts of mutant M 184 V. CONCLUSION: By utilizing the replication dynamics of HIV under drug pressure, a rPhenotyping format potently reveals relevant therapy-resistant minority species, even of HIV known to possess reduced replicative fitness. With its rapid turnaround of 8 days and its high sensitivity, our rPhenotyping system may be a valuable diagnostic tool for detecting the early emergence of therapy-threatening HIV minorities or the persistence of residual resistant virus...|$|R
40|$|Patients with KRAS {{mutations}} do {{not respond}} to epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) inhibitors and fail to benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. Mutation analysis of KRAS is needed before starting treatment with monoclonal anti-EGFR antibodies in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). The objective {{of this study is to}} develop a multiplex allele-specific PCR (MAS-PCR) assay to detect KRAS mutations. We developed a single-tube MAS-PCR assay for the detection of seven KRAS mutations (G 12 D, G 12 A, G 12 R, G 12 C, G 12 S, G 12 V, and G 13 D). We performed MAS-PCR assay analysis for KRAS on DNA isolated from 270 formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) colorectal cancer tissues. Sequences of all 270 samples were determined by pyrosequencing. Seven known point-mutation DNA samples diluted with wild-type DNA were assayed to determine the limitation of detection and reproducibility of the MAS-PCR assay. Overall, the results of MAS-PCR assay were in good concordance with pyrosequencing, and only seven <b>discordant</b> <b>samples</b> were found. The MAS-PCR assay reproducibly detected 1 to 2 % mutant alleles. The most common mutations were G 13 D in codon 13 (49. 17 %), G 12 D (25. 83 %) and G 12 V (12. 50 %) in codon 12. The MAS-PCR assay provides a rapid, cost-effective, and reliable diagnostic tool for accurate detection of KRAS mutations in routine FFPE colorectal cancer tissues...|$|R

40|$|Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are {{the major}} cause of the common cold. HRVs were {{recently}} reclassified into the Enterovirus genus (HEV) in the Picornaviridae family. HRVs {{and other members of}} the HEV genus share many common features, including sense RNA genomes and partial nucleotide sequence identity. The aim of this study was to evaluate different HRV detection strategies. Samples from adults with acute respiratory infection (n = 291) who were treated in São Paulo Hospital (2001 - 2003) were tested using three assays. The first assay detected picornaviruses by RT-PCR and hybridization, the second detected rhinoviruses using RT-PCR/sequencing, and the third differentiated HRV from HEV using duplex semi-nested-RT-PCR. Analysis of the results obtained from the first two strategies revealed 83 % concordance. <b>Discordant</b> <b>samples</b> were then evaluated by the third protocol, and 82 % were negative. The picornavirus detection protocol was more sensitive but less specific than the rhinovirus detection protocols. The semi-nested protocol utilized in the present study was less sensitive and was not useful in differentiating HRV from HEV. Sequencing assays examining different genes would address the best strategy of confirming rhinovirus and enterovirus infections.

Here, a retrospective {{audit of the}} Freelite SFLC assay compared results to electrophoresis (EP) /immunofixation (IFX) and the N Latex FLC assay. A total of 244 samples collected over 3. 5 months were studied using the Freelite and N Latex FLC nephelometry assays. Results were compared with serum and/or urine EP/IFX. The precision and linearity of the N Latex FLC assay was examined. Detectable paraprotein by serum or urine EP/IFX was present in 94 % of samples with kappa and 100 % with lambda FLC restriction. The correlation between the assays was higher for kappa (rho = 0. 97) than lambda (rho = 0. 89) especially wh en lambda results were above the upper limit of normal (rho = 0. 62). Agreement in the categorical diagnosis {{as measured by the}} Cohen's kappa statistic was good (0. 70). The N Latex FLC assay displayed good precision and linearity. In <b>discordant</b> <b>samples</b> the Freelite and N Latex FLC assays had equivalent agreement with IFX. Traditional methods of EP/IFX detected paraproteins in the majority of cases.

40|$|Estimates of {{the impact}} of apolipoprotein E (apo E) alleles coding for the three common isoforms on plasma lipid levels assume genetic {{homogeneity}} among the genotype classes. To test this assumption, we have determined the apo E genotype at the two common polymorphic sites (amino acids 112 and 158) by DNA amplification and hybridisation with allele‐specific oligoprobes, in 195 unrelated Caucasian participants of the Rochester Family Heart Study previously classified as heterozygotes by isoelectric focusing (IEF). Fourteen <b>discordant</b> <b>samples</b> were initially detected. Repeat typing of these samples by both methods resolved nine discrepancies and analysis of additional blood samples from the remaining five individuals eliminated a further four discrepancies. The only truly discordant allele was found in a female subject who had an E 3 isoform with the common E 2 (Cys 112, Cys 158) genotype. Transmission of this allele from the mother was demonstrated. From these results, we estimate the frequency of discrepancies between isoforms and common genotypes to be 0. 25 % in this population. Allele misclassification was caused by poor amplification of the DNA in six samples and superimposition of glycosylated and nonglycosylated apo E isoforms on isoelectric focusing gels in five samples. We conclude that the assumption of genetic homogeneity among genotype classes is valid and that misclassification due to technical difficulties is more frequent than true discordancies. © 1992 Wiley‐Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|The EURTAC trial {{demonstrated}} that the tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) erlotinib was superior to chemotherapy as first-line therapy for advanced non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) that harbor EGFR activating mutations in a predominantly Caucasian population. Based on EURTAC and several Asian trials, anti-EGFR TKIs are standard of care for EGFR mutation-positive NSCLC. We sought to validate a rapid multiplex EGFR mutation assay as a companion diagnostic assay to select patients for this therapy. Samples from the EURTAC trial were prospectively screened for EGFR mutations {{using a combination of}} laboratory-developed tests (LDTs), and tested retrospectively with the cobas EGFR mutation test (EGFR PCR test). The EGFR PCR test results were compared to the original LDT results and to Sanger sequencing, using a subset of specimens from patients screened for the trial. Residual tissue was available from 487 (47 %) of the 1044 patients screened for the trial. The EGFR PCR test showed high concordance with LDT results with a 96. 3 % overall agreement. The clinical outcome of patients who were EGFR-mutation detected by the EGFR PCR test was very similar to the entire EURTAC cohort. The concordance between the EGFR PCR test and Sanger sequencing was 90. 6 %.

40|$|A {{number of}} {{susceptibility}} loci for Alzheimer 2 ̆ 7 s disease (AD) {{have been identified}} including a region on Chromosome 10 q 21 –q 22. Within this region the plasminogen activator urokinase gene (PLAU) was considered as a reasonable candidate from its functional implication in plasmin generation, a serine protease capable of degrading beta-Amyloid (Aβ) protein. We screened 56 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) around PLAU using 1751 individuals from four independent case–control samples (Munich, N= 679; Bonn N= 282; Brescia (Italy) N= 219; Perth (Australia) N= 557 and one <b>discordant</b> sib-pair <b>sample</b> (Munich N= 622). In brain tissue samples of neuropathologically confirmed cases with AD (N= 33) we analyzed plaque counts according to the risk allele. We identified that one functional exonic SNP (rs 2227564) is associated with development of AD using the four independent case–control samples (Munich, P= 0. 02; Bonn, P= 0. 005; Brescia (Italy), P= 0. 001; Perth (Australia), P= 0. 03) and the <b>discordant</b> sib-pair <b>sample</b> (P= 0. 001). In brain tissue, from neuropathologically confirmed cases with AD, we identified significantly higher plaque counts in carriers of the risk allele (N= 6; 60. 3 ± 16. 9) compared with non-carriers (N= 9; 26. 3 ± 8. 8; P= 0. 007). This study provides compelling evidence of a genetic and functional involvement of a common PLAU variant into the pathogenesis of AD. Further functional investigations are warranted to elucidate the specific role of PLAU, respectively, PLAU variants in the metabolism of Aβ protein...|$|R
40|$|Originally {{composed}} of the single family Chlamydiaceae, the Chlamydiales order has extended considerably {{over the last several}} decades. Chlamydia-related bacteria were added and classified into six different families and family-level lineages: the Criblamydiaceae, Parachlamydiaceae, Piscichlamydiaceae, Rhabdochlamydiaceae, Simkaniaceae, and Waddliaceae. While several members of the Chlamydiaceae family are known pathogens, recent studies showed diverse associations of Chlamydia-related bacteria with human and animal infections. Some of these latter bacteria might be of medical importance since, given their ability to replicate in free-living amoebae, they may also replicate efficiently in other phagocytic cells, including cells of the innate immune system. Thus, a new Chlamydiales-specific real-time PCR targeting the conserved 16 S rRNA gene was developed. This new molecular tool can detect at least five DNA copies and show very high specificity without cross-amplification from other bacterial clade DNA. The new PCR was validated with 128 clinical samples positive or negative for Chlamydia trachomatis or C. pneumoniae. Of 65 positive samples, 61 (93. 8 %) were found to be positive with the new PCR. The four <b>discordant</b> <b>samples,</b> retested with the original test, were determined to be negative or below detection limits. Then, the new PCR was applied to 422 nasopharyngeal swabs taken from children with or without pneumonia; a total of 48 (11. 4 %) samples were determined to be positive, and 45 of these were successfully sequenced.
