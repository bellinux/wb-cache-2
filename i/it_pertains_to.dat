5|$|Snow {{refers to}} forms of ice {{crystals}} that precipitate {{from the atmosphere}} (usually from clouds) and undergo changes on the Earth's surface. <b>It</b> <b>pertains</b> <b>to</b> frozen crystalline water throughout its life cycle, starting when, under suitable conditions, the ice crystals form in the atmosphere, increase to millimeter size, precipitate and accumulate on surfaces, then metamorphose in place, and ultimately melt, slide or sublimate away. Snowstorms organize and develop by feeding on sources of atmospheric moisture and cold air. Snowflakes nucleate around particles in the atmosphere by attracting supercooled water droplets, which freeze in hexagonal-shaped crystals. Snowflakes take {{on a variety of}} shapes, basic among these are platelets, needles, columns and rime. As snow accumulates into a snowpack, it may blow into drifts. Over time, accumulated snow metamorphoses, by sintering, sublimation and freeze-thaw. Where the climate is cold enough for year-to-year accumulation, a glacier may form. Otherwise, snow typically melts seasonally, causing runoff into streams and rivers and recharging groundwater.|$|E
5|$|The 'Land Question', as <b>it</b> <b>pertains</b> <b>to</b> {{the history}} of Prince Edward Island, Canada, related to the {{question}} of the system of ownership of land on the island. Proprietors, the owners of the land parcels on Prince Edward Island, favoured a system of renting to tenants, whilst the tenants preferred a system of freehold. In 1767 the British government divided all land in Prince Edward Island into lots to be owned by 'proprietors' who would collect rent from the settlers, or 'tenants'. Problems soon arose with this scheme, and low numbers of tenants resulted in proprietors collecting little rent, which in turn led to many proprietors defaulting on their quitrents. An attempt at compulsorily acquiring the land by the Prince Edward Island government from rent defaulters in 1781 resulted in Colonial Office intervention in 1783. In 1786, Governor Walter Patterson, who set in motion the compulsory acquisition, was removed from office.|$|E

25|$|Of {{course the}} above picture is a {{generalization}} as <b>it</b> <b>pertains</b> <b>to</b> materials with an extended lattice {{rather than a}} molecular structure. Molecular structure {{can also lead to}} localization of electrons. Although there are usually energetic reasons why a molecular structure results such that it does not exhibit partly filled orbitals (i.e. unpaired spins), some non-closed shell moieties do occur in nature. Molecular oxygen is a good example. Even in the frozen solid it contains di-radical molecules resulting in paramagnetic behavior. The unpaired spins reside in orbitals derived from oxygen p wave functions, but the overlap is limited to the one neighbor in the O2 molecules. The distances to other oxygen atoms in the lattice remain too large to lead to delocalization and the magnetic moments remain unpaired.|$|E
25|$|A common predatory {{technique}} {{that has been}} observed among benthic elasmobranchs is ambushing behavior. As <b>it</b> <b>pertains</b> <b>to</b> rays, skates, carpet sharks, and angel sharks, the predator searches for suitable hiding environments such as sand, pebbles, coral, or algae that match its coloration or patterning, which {{is also known as}} aggressive mimicry. Ambushing is a behavior in which a predator relies on its coloring, body structure, or the environment as an advantage in concealing itself while waiting on unsuspecting prey to enter its striking range. There have been recorded occasions where this form of ambushing behavior of stingrays and related benthic sharks has been directed towards a common prey type. One example of this occasion involves the chokka squid, (Loligo vulgaris reynaudii), which spawns in the inshore coastal habitats around South Africa. The diamond ray (Gymnura natalensis) frequently relies on aggressive mimicry as it blends into sandy habitats waiting for preoccupied female chokka squids who are busy spawning. Diamond rays then shoot off from the bottom substrates and use suction feeding to ingest the spawning squids and their eggs. Suction feeding works in conjunction and is aided by ram filter feeding, which is demonstrated by pelagic rays including the manta ray (Manta birostris) and the closely related devil rays (Mobula sp.). Many of the pelagic rays have external mouth structures called cephalic lobes that assist in siphoning in water and planktonic organisms as the rays swim in acrobatic patterns in these patches of food. A stingray's diet includes small fish, snails, clams, and shrimp, and some other small sea creatures.|$|E
