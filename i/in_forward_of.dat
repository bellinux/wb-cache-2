50|$|In early 1917, the Sopwith chief engineer, Herbert Smith, began {{designing}} a new fighter (internal Sopwith designation 5F.1) {{powered by the}} geared 200 hp Hispano-Suiza 8B. The resulting Dolphin was a two-bay, single-seat biplane, with the upper wings attached to an open steel cabane frame above the cockpit. To maintain the correct centre of gravity, the lower wings were positioned 13 <b>in</b> <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> the upper wings, creating the Dolphin’s distinctive negative wing stagger. The pilot sat with his head through the frame, where he had an excellent view. This configuration sometimes caused difficulty for novices, who {{found it difficult to}} keep the aircraft pointed at the horizon because the nose was not visible from the cockpit. The cockpit was nevertheless warm and comfortable, in part because pipes ran alongside the cockpit walls to the two side-mounted radiator blocks. Shutters in front of each radiator core allowed the engine temperature to be controlled.|$|E

30|$|Research on the CAC {{is being}} {{expanded}} to include a CAC for shuttle car operators to provide respiratory protection from respirable coal mine dust. Ambient mine air is filtered and blown over the operator through a plenum built into the shuttle car canopy. A {{new version of the}} CAC, specifically designed for the shuttle car, has been developed under a NIOSH contract by Marshall University and J.H. Fletcher [contract # 200 - 2015 - 63485], and is based upon NIOSH design recommendations. NIOSH completed the required laboratory testing of the shuttle car CAC to determine its ability to reduce the shuttle car operators’ respirable coal dust exposure. This paper details results of testing the shuttle car CAC in 0.61  m/s (120 fpm), 2.0  m/s (400 fpm), and 4.3  m/s (850 fpm) ventilation airflows. Since results with 4.3  m/s (850 fpm) ventilation airflows were not satisfactory additional tests with modifications to the location and design of the CAC were conducted. Modifications included moving the CAC 22.86  cm (9 <b>in.)</b> <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> operator location and adding a 5.08  cm (2 in.) spoiler. These modifications provided satisfactory results, thus showing that a shuttle car CAC can be a viable dust control device for the protection of shuttle car operators to coal mine respirable dust.|$|E
