I don’t know much about what’s happening with that. Honestly, I don’t know what the studio wants to do next. I presume there will be some future projects for me to work on. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>doing</b> that, I really do. But I’m not frustrated that it isn’t one of them. At the moment I have a lot of stage things happening and I’m busy enough with that, so I really don’t need more on my plate." ...|$|E
500|$|Jackson told Sister 2 Sister magazine, [...] "There {{were some}} people who didn't like the {{direction}} I took with this album. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>doing</b> dance songs and I think my fans expect that of me. I have been getting more behind the scenes with film and television. I will probably continue to do music – and acting is still a strong passion of mine – but I really have been loving behind-the-scenes work: producing, directing and all the technical stuff". A {{few months before the}} split, a spokesperson for the label told Billboard, [...] "Unfortunately we haven't experienced the results we would have liked with this new album. But we respect and support Janet".|$|E
500|$|Hundreds {{of actors}} sought the main {{roles in the}} film, {{including}} Al Pacino, Dustin Hoffman and Richard Gere for Jacob, and Andie MacDowell, Julia Roberts and Madonna for Jezzie. Eventually, Tim Robbins and Elizabeth Peña were cast; both auditioned early and {{neither of them had}} starred in a feature film before. Robbins said the film presented for him [...] "a great opportunity to go in a different direction. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>doing</b> comedy, but I know I can do other things as well." [...] The film's military advisor was Vietnam veteran Captain Dale Dye, who provided a five-day boot camp military training for the actors playing soldiers in the Vietnam storyline (including Robbins, Pruitt Taylor Vince, Eriq La Salle and Ving Rhames).|$|E

500|$|Between landing {{the role}} in The Hunger Games and the film's release, {{he played a}} lead role and served as an {{executive}} producer for two films: Detention (2011) and The Forger (2012). In Detention, he {{played the role of}} popular teenager Clapton Davis in a film the plot of which has been compared to 1985's The Breakfast Club. His role in The Forger was as a 15-year-old orphan who finds himself in trouble until Alfred Molina's character comes to his aid. The film was not well received but the actors' chemistry together and their performance was. He next reprised his role as Sean Anderson in the 2012 Journey to the Center of the Earth sequel, [...] Hutcherson has always been vocal about his desire to work on films of all sorts of genres. Regarding the switch from comedy-drama The Kids Are All Right to the Journey sequel, he stated: [...] "For me, I like to do all different types of films and to go from having that awesome [...] kind of thing that <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>doing</b> so much with great characters and a really great script to a bigger kind of studio film, to just cover the whole kind of spectrum of movies is really, really cool." [...] Although the film was largely panned, it fared well commercially and his performance was well received, with Kofi Outlaw of Screenrant.com appreciating how he [...] "does a good job holding the screen and portraying a somewhat layered protagonist". Later in 2012, he appeared in Red Dawn, a remake of the 1984 film of the same name. The film was panned by critics, achieving only a 12 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes, the lowest score of any film Hutcherson has acted in.|$|E

Why quit?" [...] During an interview on July 20, 2015, Keillor announced his intent to retire from the show after the 2015–2016 season, saying, [...] "I have {{a lot of other things}} that I want to do.

2500|$|Blackman {{says that}} playing with Kravitz and playing jazz are {{different}}. [...] "My job with Lenny {{is a different}} thing. My job is to play a beat for hours, and make it feel good, and add some exciting fills and exciting colors, when it fits tastefully", Blackman says. [...] "My job in my band or in a creative situation is a totally different thing. We may start with a groove that feels great, I may play that for hours too, but I'm going to explore and expand and change that, play around with the rhythm and interject with the soloists." [...] "I like dance music and I like making the music feel good", says Blackman. [...] "To drive an audience of 100,000 into complete oblivion by playing a groove so strong ... <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>doing</b> that. I love the chance to show versatility." ...|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{claiming}} {{that she would}} never return to EastEnders in 1997, Lawrence was upset when she discovered that both Sid Owen and Mike Reid (Ricky and Frank) were leaving EastEnders in 2000 as, in her opinion, it ruled out any chance of her character returning to the show. She commented, [...] "It would be great fun to get all the Butcher clan back for a few months. I hear Diane's name mentioned quite a lot on the show — it makes me feel like I've never really left. But all the people I'm connected with are leaving, which makes going back harder and I'm really sorry about that. It would be great to have the Butcher clan come back for Mike's sendoff. But, sadly, I don't think there is the space for me to go back full-time." [...] In 2002, she was asked if she would ever return to the soap and she responded, [...] "If they asked me, I’d love to go back. Not on a long term contract or anything because <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>doing</b> other things but I’d definitely like to go back." ...|$|E

I never have any company, and I do so long for it. It's very lonesome here at Golden Gate. Oh, if you would only stay to tea with me, it would make me so happy. I am all prepared. I prepare every Saturday morning, in particular, so that if Cousin Abner's girls did come, I would be all ready. And when nobody comes, Juliana and I have to eat {{everything}} up ourselves.
