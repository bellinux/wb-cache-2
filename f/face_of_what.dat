25|$|Adams was {{appointed}} as West Indies captain in 2000, replacing Brian Lara. He would not last long, leading {{the team to}} a 5–0 series loss on the 2000/01 tour of Australia; after the tour he lost both the captaincy (to Carl Hooper) and {{his place in the}} national team. News of his impending termination was broken to Adams by friend and national TV reporter, Peter Furst. The ever-cool Jamaican simply responded, ¨Have you heard something I haven't?¨ He then reflected on his career, saying that whatever happened it had all been a blessing – both the good and bad. Adams´ grace in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would crush many a lesser person reflects the nature of the man; a cricketer whose best attributes can never be recorded on the score sheets.|$|E
500|$|Great {{personal}} rapport {{developed between}} Smith and his Portuguese counterpart, António de Oliveira Salazar. On first meeting in Portugal in September 1964, the two Prime Ministers found they shared many common views regarding {{race relations in}} their respective countries, Britain's handling of the Commonwealth, and what Smith called the [...] "complacency of the major powers of the free world" [...] in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> the pair saw as inexorable communist expansionism. After hearing Smith's argument in favour of Rhodesian independence, Salazar privately pledged Portugal's complete support. The RF called a new general election for May 1965 and, campaigning on an election promise of independence, won a clean sweep of all 50 [...] "A"-roll seats. A week later, Wilson met with Portuguese Foreign Minister Alberto Franco Nogueira, whom he pressed on Portugal's secret dealings with Rhodesia. Nogueira categorically denied anything of the sort.|$|E
500|$|In his {{depiction}} of the Petersburg background, Dostoyevsky accentuates the squalor and human wretchedness that pass before Raskolnikov's eyes. He also uses Raskolnikov's encounter with Marmeladov to present both the heartlessness of Raskolnikov's convictions and the alternative set of values to be set against them. Dostoyevsky believes that the [...] "freedom" [...] propounded by the aforementioned ideas is a dreadful freedom [...] "that is contained by no values, because it is before values". The product of this [...] "freedom", Raskolnikov, is in perpetual revolt against society, himself, and God. He thinks that he is self-sufficient and self-contained, {{but at the end}} [...] "his boundless self-confidence must disappear in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is greater than himself, and his self-fabricated justification must humble itself before the higher justice of God".* Peace (2005), 75–76 Dostoyevsky calls for the regeneration and renewal of the [...] "sick" [...] Russian society through the re-discovering of its country, its religion, and its roots.* Wasiolek (2005), 56–57 ...|$|E

His {{criticism}} of the Spanish officers led some to quit the siege in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they saw as his insults. Their morale improved somewhat when Admiral Bernard Desjean, Baron de Pointis sailed into the bay on 26 February with a force of 18 men-of-war from Cadiz. Gibraltar's garrison immediately went on alert, expecting a landing {{at the south end}} of the peninsula, but this did not materialise. The reason soon became clear; Leake had returned with a combined English, Dutch and Portuguese force of 35 ships. In the subsequent battle in the Strait of Gibraltar, the French lost five of their ships, including Pointis' flagship, and Pointis himself was fatally wounded. Leake's fleet sailed into the bay on 31 March, bringing with it fresh troops from Mountjoy's Grenadiers and units of the Portuguese army. Hesse rejoiced at the admiral's arrival: ...|$|E
500|$|The Foreign Office, meanwhile, was {{determined}} not to back down in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was seen as a further affront to British prestige and a challenge. Thorneycroft argued that if the Victorious did not pass through the Straits on her return journey, Britain [...] "should suffer a substantial political defeat with unpredictable effects on our military position in the Far East," [...] and was supported in this view by Admiral Mountbatten and David Luce, First Sea Lord and Chief of Naval Staff. Mountbatten went even further, warning Thorneycroft that a failure to meet the challenge would have [...] "serious repercussions" [...] on Britain's [...] "whole military stature, not only in the Far East but worldwide." [...] Luce and Mountbatten also thought this the perfect opportunity to put pressure on Jakarta for the first time, Luce stating that the return passage [...] "might pass the initiative to us" [...] and Mountbatten seeing it as an opportune moment to divert Sukarno from his Malaysian raiding. At the very least, innocent passage through the Strait had to be defended.|$|E
500|$|Fox's {{reception}} to [...] "Dangerous Game" [...] {{is similarly}} positive. Reviewing the CD {{release of the}} original Thunderbirds soundtrack, Morag Reavley of BBC Online describes Anderson's rendition as [...] "slinky, sexy and slightly off-key, like a hung-over Zsa Zsa Gabor". For Heather Phares of AllMusic, the tune is a highlight of the album: while the [...] "Latin Rhythm Instrumental" [...] " [...] the '60s' ongoing fascination with exotica and Latin pop", the lyrical version [...] "could be a kissing cousin to seductive spy themes like 'Goldfinger'." [...] Stephen La Rivière, writer of Filmed in Supermarionation: A History of the Future praises the technical proficiency of the production staff, characterising the skiing and dancing scenes as [...] " [...] in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> puppets can and can't do." [...] He sums up the episode as [...] "a glorious example of Thunderbirds at its best, combining all the elements that made the show so popular: the characters, the adventure, the rescues and, of course, the humour." [...] Expanding on his last point, La Rivière emphasises the family appeal of the episode's comedy, arguing that the subtlety of Parker's occasional double entendres is counter-acted by his slapstick moments, such as the innovative use of Penelope's umbrella (described as [...] "doing a 'Mary Poppins'").|$|E

500|$|Amidst {{speculation}} of rifts between Dempsey and Pompeo, {{and even}} show runner Rhimes, the former maintained his stance of leaving in a [...] "very good" [...] place with his co-star of ten years. On his relationships with Pompeo in particular, he said [...] "it’s beautiful. We’re like a married couple. It’s 10 years, {{and it was}} magic from the beginning. Chemistry right away.” He thanked his fans on Twitter and wrote, [...] "I {{want to thank all}} the fans, what an incredible 11 yrs, I love you all." [...] Rhimes asserted on the importance of Dempsey's character in the statement she released at his departure: “Derek Shepherd is and will always be an incredibly important character—for Meredith, for me and for the fans. I absolutely never imagined saying goodbye to our ‘McDreamy.’ As Ellis Grey would say: the carousel never stops turning.” Pompeo too took to Twitter to react to the death of Shepherd and wrote, [...] "I am honored and excited {{to tell the story of}} how Meredith goes on in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> feels like the impossible. I hope you will all join me on her journey.” It was the first time she spoke out publicly about Dempsey's publicised exit.|$|E
500|$|Smith, Field {{and others}} met in Salisbury on 13 March 1962 {{and agreed to}} unite against Whitehead as the Rhodesian Front (RF). The Front ranged from former UFP men, {{including}} Smith, who advocated gradual transition and a government based on merit and electoral qualifications, to the Dominion Party's more right-wing members, some of whom held segregationist views not dissimilar to those of South Africa's National Party. Amid these differences, the nascent RF coalition was shaky at best. Its members were brought together by their common opposition to Whitehead's promises of fast-track reform, which they agreed {{would lead to a}} Congo-style national crisis, the flight of the white community and ultimately the country's destruction. In the wider Cold War context, the ardently anti-communist RF aspired to represent a pro-Western bulwark in Africa, alongside South Africa and Portugal, in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> they saw as Soviet and Chinese expansionism. Smith asserted that the RF worked to thwart [...] "this mad idea of a hand-over, of a sell-out of the European and his civilisation, indeed of everything he had put into his country". [...] "The white man is the master of Rhodesia," [...] he said; [...] " [...] has built it and intends to keep it".|$|E

2500|$|In addition, Newton {{would spend}} {{much of his life}} seeking and {{revealing}} what could be considered a Bible Code. He placed a great deal of emphasis upon the interpretation of the Book of Revelation, writing generously upon this book and authoring several manuscripts detailing his interpretations. Unlike a prophet in the true sense of the word, Newton relied upon existing Scripture to prophesy for him, believing his interpretations would set the record straight in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he considered to be [...] "so little understood". [...] In 1754, 27 years after his death, Isaac Newton's treatise, An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture would be published, and though it does not argue any prophetic meaning, it does exemplify what Newton considered to be just one popular misunderstanding of Scripture.|$|E

Baccarin has said of her role: [...] "being, I guess, the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> people want to see... I think there's an aspect of politicians: You need to embody what everybody wants to see, {{and at the same time}} you have your own agenda." [...] Laura Vandervoort plays the Visitor Lisa. Vandervoort is unaware of Lisa's ultimate agenda, which she believes makes the creative process more exciting.
