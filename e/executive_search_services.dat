40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. Globalisation of the <b>Executive</b> <b>Search</b> Industry in Europe, 1980 - 2007 aimed to develop {{knowledge and understanding of}} the contemporary globalisation of the head-hunting industry in Europe and its implications for new forms and geographies of <b>executive</b> <b>search</b> and selection. Europe has become the most complex and sophisticated pan-regional market for <b>executive</b> <b>search,</b> fuelled by free labour mobility within the European Union (EU), thereby offering a unique environment in which to study the changing practices of the head-hunting industry. Theoretically, the project, firstly, develops existing knowledge and understanding of the strategic and operational transnational capacities of knowledge-intensive professional services in a globally connected business environment; and secondly, explores the role of head-hunters as key 'intermediaries' in the reproduction and management of executive labour in Europe's knowledge-based economy. Quantitative time series data (1980 - 2005) of the office locations of <b>executive</b> <b>search</b> firms have been collected from the Executive Grapevine. These can be used to map the initial internationalisation and recent globalisation geographies in Europe. 51 case study interviews have been undertaken with the leading firms and professional bodies based in London and several European cities (also one association in New York). These provide original insights into and understanding of <b>executive</b> <b>search</b> firms' strategies and their intermediary role in Europe's elite labour market. All research participants and their employing firms have been made anonymous and unidentifiable throughout the data. This includes removing their names, the firm names, references to particular projects and their career histories. Further information is available from the ESRC Award web page and the Headhunters project web page.

50|$|<b>Executive</b> <b>search</b> (informally called headhunting) is a {{specialized}} recruitment service which organizations pay {{to seek out}} and recruit highly qualified candidates for senior-level and executive jobs (e.g., President, Vice-president, CEO). Headhunters may also seek out and recruit other highly specialized and/or skilled positions in organizations {{for which there is}} strong competition in the job market for the top talent, such as senior data analysts or computer programmers. The method usually involves commissioning a third-party organization, typically an <b>executive</b> <b>search</b> firm, but possibly a standalone consultant or consulting firm, to research the availability of suitable qualified candidates working for competitors or related businesses or organizations. Having identified a shortlist of qualified candidates who match the client's requirements, the <b>executive</b> <b>search</b> firm may act as an intermediary to contact the individual(s) and see if they might be interested in moving to a new employer. The <b>executive</b> <b>search</b> firm may also carry out initial screening of the candidate, negotiations on remuneration and benefits, and preparing the employment contract.|$|R
