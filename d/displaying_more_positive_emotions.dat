40|$|Attachment theory {{asserts that}} secure {{attachment}} representations are developed through sensitive and consistent caregiving. If sensitive caregiving {{is a constant}} characteristic of the parent, then siblings should have concordant attachment classifications. The authors explored maternal attachment quality assessed by the Attachment Q-Set, maternal sensitivity, and specific mother–child interactions between siblings. Hour-long observations {{took place in the}} homes of 9 preschool sibling pairs and their immediate caregivers. The interactions were analyzed using a modified version of Bales’ Small Group Analysis. The results reveal attachment discordance in a third of sibling pairs. While maternal sensitivity was higher with older siblings and mothers <b>displayed</b> <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>emotions</b> when interacting with their younger siblings, attachment quality was not associated with birth order. Therefore, a shift toward a more contextual, family-based perspective of attachment is recommended to further understand how attachment strategies are created and maintained within the child's everyday context...|$|R

Consistent {{with the notion that}} <b>positive</b> <b>emotions</b> help build personal resources, positive emotional expression correlated with the self-reported personality traits of affiliation, competence, and low negative emotionality across adulthood and predicted changes in competence and negative emotionality.

40|$|UNLABELLED BACKGROUND/STUDY CONTEXT: According to the socioemotional {{selectivity}} theory (SST; Mather & Carstensen, 2003, Psychological Sciences, 14, 409 - 415), {{aging is}} associated with greater motivation to regulate emotions. The authors propose that the language people use to describe personal memories provides an index of age differences in emotional self-regulation. METHODS In the present article, the authors reanalyzed three previously published studies in which older (aged 60 - 88) and younger (aged 17 - 33) participants described emotional and neutral memories from their recent and distant pasts. The authors analyzed {{the language of the}} memories using Pennebaker, Booth, and Francis's (2007) Linguistic Inquiry Word Count program (Austin, TX: LIWC Inc.), which calculates the percentage of <b>positive</b> and negative <b>emotion</b> words. RESULTS In Studies 1 and 2, older adults used <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>emotion</b> words than did younger adults to describe their autobiographical memories from the recent past, particularly when these were of a neutral valence. In Study 3, older adults used <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>emotion</b> words when describing more recent memories (from the past 5 years) but not when describing distant childhood or adolescent memories. CONCLUSION The authors suggest that these age differences in emotional expressivity support SST, and represent an as-yet unreported age difference that may stem from differences in motivation to regulate emotion...|$|R

40|$|Quantitative {{analyses}} {{conducted on}} the self-reports of first year university students {{suggest that there is}} a relationship between the ways they emotionally experience their course and the approach they take to the learning of that course. Students who <b>more</b> strongly experience <b>positive</b> <b>emotions,</b> such as hope and pride, and more weakly experience negative emotions (such as anger, boredom, anxiety and shame), are likely to be adopting more of a deep approach to learning. In comparison, students who describe more of a surface approach to learning are more likely to report an experience of lower <b>positive</b> <b>emotions</b> and higher negative emotions. Both the experience of <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>emotions</b> and the adoption of a deeper approach are associated with higher achievement scores. Lower achievement is associated with surface approaches to learning and negative emotional experiences.

40|$|Creativity thrives {{when people}} {{experience}} <b>positive</b> <b>emotions.</b> How to design an interactive {{system that can}} effectively make use of this potential is, however, still an unanswered question. In this paper, we propose one approach to this problem that relies on hacking into the cognitive appraisal processes that form part of <b>positive</b> <b>emotions.</b> To demonstrate our approach we have conceived, made, and evaluated a novel interactive system that influences an individual’s appraisals of their own idea generation processes by providing real-time and believable feedback about the originality of their ideas. The system {{can be used to}} manipulate this feedback to make the user’s ideas appear more or less original.

40|$|This thesis {{investigated}} {{the link between}} trust and language in online dyadic, online group, and virtual community interactions. The first two empirical studies revealed that <b>positive</b> <b>emotion</b> is reliably linked to trust, {{that is to say}} that dyads and groups that produce <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>emotion</b> words show greater trust. In addition, by priming group members to believe their group was either high or low in trustworthiness, the second empirical study revealed that group members produce <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>emotion</b> words as a consequence of greater trust. A third study revealed an additional important language phenomena to trust, this was a type of linguistic mimicry known as linguistic style matching (LSM). The study guided groups through established phases of group development (relational, task, and task resolution), findings revealed that LSM in the early, relational phase, predicted trust. Further analysis of the relationship between phase of development, <b>positive</b> <b>emotion</b> words and LSM revealed that when LSM was low in the relational phase, <b>positive</b> <b>emotion</b> once again became a cue used to trust in subsequent task phases. The Relevant and Reliable Language Theory was proposed to explain the phase of group development dependent effects of LSM and <b>positive</b> <b>emotion</b> on trust. In short, the theory states that language must be relevant, i. e. the group is still undecided regarding trust judgements and still seeks trust relevant information, and reliable, i. e. in a given context, the language must be considered a genuine trust signal, and not one that appears ‘faked’ by ‘opportunists’. Based on the novel theory, it was hypothesised in a forth study that disrupting LSM in an early relational phase, and <b>positive</b> <b>emotion</b> in a subsequent task phase (contexts where LSM and <b>positive</b> <b>emotion</b> were proposed to be most relevant and reliable to trust), would have the most detrimental effect on trust. A confederate implementing these disruptions, relative to a comparable control, supported the theory; with groups who were subject to the ‘strong’ disruption producing lower trust behaviour than the control group. A final study extended finding to real world online interactions in a virtual community focused on discussing credit card fraud, i. e. a criminal online group. The discussions were relational, rather than task focused, thus The Relevant and Reliable Language Theory predicted that LSM would be the most important language variable related to trust. The theory was supported as LSM, but not <b>positive</b> <b>emotion,</b> ebbed and flowed in line with predicted levels of trust...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{investigating}} direct links between peer acceptance and parent-child interactions, and exploring whether subjective experience of the self-in-relation would function as a mediator. A central assumption was that better accepted children are more capable of autonomy-within-connectedness. Eighty kindergartners {{with a mean age}} of 60 months and their mothers and fathers (n = 74) participated in the study. The children were selected to be popular, average, or rejected by their peers. Subjective experience was assessed with a Doll Story Completion Task and Cassidy's Puppet Interview (Cassidy, 1988; Ver-schueren, Marcoen, & Schoefs, 1996), and the Pictorial Scales of Perceived Competence and Acceptance (Harter & Pike, 1984). Results showed that better accepted children and their mothers showed a higher balance of control behaviors and were more likely to be simultaneously en-gaged in play. They also tended to share <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>emotions.</b> <b>More</b> control in the father-child interactions was related to lower peer acceptance. In addition, better ac-cepted girls and their fathers were more often dyadically engaged in play, and shared more fantasy play, than less well-accepted girls and fathers. Children who shared <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> <b>emotions</b> with their parents presented parent-child relation-ships as <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> and were <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> about themselves. Interestingly, more control with father was linked to a more negative sense of self for boys, but a <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> sense of self for girls. Because girls tend to be more directed toward con-nectedness from a young age, maybe it is more important to them to develop their autonomy, at kindergarten age. Control between fathers and sons may be more likely to become competitive, which may make boys feel less accepted. Children who represented parent-child relationships as more secure were better accepted by peers. The connections (especially with father-child security) were stronger for girls. Contrary to expectations, better accepted children were not <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> about themselves. Regression analyses showed that the representation of the mother-child relationship mediated the relation between shared <b>positive</b> <b>emotions</b> and peer acceptance. Controlling for security with mother, peer acceptance was no longer related with shared <b>positive</b> <b>emotions.</b> This study offers one of the first indica-tions that the meaning the child gives to relationships may be more important than specific behaviors by themselves.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a study of}} the attitudes towards science and learning environments among junior secondary school science students in New Zealand, focussing particularly on Maori and Pacific Island students. The rationale for the research was that ethnic minority group students often experience difficulties in adapting to modern science education. The study was restricted to forms three, four and five of the New Zealand education system in order to focus attention primarily on the development of recommendations for enhancement of science education outcomes which relate to the early years of science education. The study aimed to investigate student attitudes towards science and their perceptions of their learning environments by using questionnaire surveys and interviews in order to produce complementary information about students' attitudes and perceptions. The study produced some unexpected findings. For example, Maori and Pacific Island students <b>displayed</b> <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> attitudes towards science than others, and female students <b>displayed</b> <b>more</b> <b>positive</b> attitudes than males. These findings contradict those of many previous studies. The findings of the study are used to provide input to the development of recommendations for the enhancement of educational outcomes for all students, but especially for ethnic minority students in science...|$|R
