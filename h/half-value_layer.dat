40|$|Purpose: Small {{animals are}} {{increasingly}} used as translational models in preclinical imaging studies, {{during which the}} subjects can be exposed to large amounts of radiation. While the radiation levels are generally sublethal, {{studies have shown that}} low-level radiation can change physiological parameters in mice. In order to rule out any influence of radiation on the outcome of such experiments, or resulting deterministic effects in the subjects, the levels of radiation involved need to be addressed. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the radiation dose delivered by the GE eXplore 120 microCT non-invasively using Monte Carlo simulations in GATE and to compare results to previously obtained experimental values. Methods: Tungsten X-ray spectra were simulated at 70, 80, and 97 kVp using an analytical tool and their <b>half-value</b> <b>layers</b> were simulated for spectra validation against experimentally measured values of the physical X-ray tube. A Monte Carlo model of the microCT system was set up and four protocols that are regularly applied to live animal scanning were implemented. The computed tomography dose index (CTDI) inside a PMMA phantom was derived and multiple field of view acquisitions were simulated using the PMMA phantom, a representative mouse and rat. Results: Simulated <b>half-value</b> <b>layers</b> agreed with experimentally obtained results within a 7 % error window. The CTDI ranged from 20 to 56 mGy and closely matched experimental values. Derived organ doses in mice reached 459 mGy in bones and up to 200 mGy in soft tissue organs using the highest energy protocol. Dose levels in rats were lower due to the increased mass of the animal compared to mice. The uncertainty of all dose simulations was below 14 %. Conclusions: Monte Carlo simulations proved a valuable tool to investigate the 3 D dose distribution in animals from microCT. Small animals, especially mice (due to their small volume), receive large amounts of radiation from the GE eXplore 120 microCT, which might alter physiological parameters in a longitudinal study setup.

In addition to improving storage and disposal methods within the laboratory, the system confines radioactive mate-rials to one area and reduces handling and radiation exposure time. Nuclear medicine laboratories lacking adequate preparation and storage facilities are often forced to store prep vials and syringes containing 99 m Tc in an open box or bag (Fig. 1) in the immediate work area, a method that presented disposal difficulties to our staff. Such a method is also unsightly, unsystematic, consumes valuable counter space, and unnecessarily exposes workers in the adjacent prep area. The need for a disposal system that was safe, economical, and simple to use, in addition to allowing for the separation of materials according to day of use, was evident. Materials and Methods A lead-shielded apparatus was designed (Fig. 2) to improve the methods of storing and disposing of radioactive materials.

Methods and Materials: D 1 /D 2 and TPR 1, 2 were measured on a Gulmay D 3300 unit. D 2 /D 5 and TPR 2, 5 were measured on a Gulmay D 3300 unit and a Pantak Therapax DXT 300 unit. Different field sizes, <b>half-value</b> <b>layers</b> (HVLs), and distances from the source were investigated in a 30 cm × 30 cm × 30 cm water phantom and a 20 cm × 20 cm × 10 cm solid acrylic phantom. A PTW M 30001 0. 6 cc cylindrical ionization chamber and a T 10008 electrometer system were utilized for all measurements. Results: D 1 /D 2 reflected the changes expected in the penetration of superficial x-rays due to beam hardening and D 2 /D 5 was found to vary appreciably with field size, source-to-surface distance (SSD) and HVL. The most practical conditions for the measurement of TPR 1, 2 as a potential beam quality specifier could not be established in this work and TPR 2, 5 varied with field size and HVL, irrespective of the distance from the source and the energy. Conclusions: D 1 /D 2 and D 2 /D 5 could be a practical quality index in field sizes of at least 11. 28 cm diameter defined at an SSD of 50 cm. Measurements at different HVLs and source-to-chamber distances (SCDs) are needed to establish the most practical measurement conditions of TPR 1, 2.

To {{model the}} kilovoltage (kV) x-ray {{source of a}} superficial x-ray unit and to validate a rapid and accurate in-house software (kVDoseCalc) tool for computing absorbed radiation dose from superficial x-ray therapy energies. To validate kVDoseCalc, we measured central axis percent depth-doses (PDDs) and profiles using an Xstrahl 150 x-ray system (Gulmay Medical Inc.). We also compared the measured and calculated PDDs to those from the British Journal of Radiology Supplement 25 (BJR 25). The Xstrahl source was characterized as a point spectral source with varying spatial fluence, and this source model was used in kVDoseCalc to compute absorbed radiation dose at points of interest (POIs). The spectrum was derived by inputting <b>half-value</b> <b>layers</b> (HVLs) and kVps into third party software Spektr and SpekCalc. Doses for the PDDs and profiles were measured using 2, 5, and 15 cm cone sizes at 80, 120, 140, and 150 kVp energies in a scanning water phantom (IBA Blue Phantom 2) using Scanditronix Wellhofer farmer-type and compact chambers of volumes 0. 65 and 0. 13 cc, respectively. The percent difference in the computed PDD doses compared with our measurements range from - 4. 76 % to 4. 78 % with an overall mean percent difference and standard deviation of 1. 52 % and 0. 74 %, respectively. The percent difference between our PDD measurements and those from BJR 25 range from - 13. 98 % to 15. 7 % with an overall mean percent difference and standard deviation of 4. 94 % and 2. 10 %, respectively; showing that our measurements agree much better with kVDoseCalc than BJR 25.

These curves were used for the determination of photon spectra produced by the X-ray machine SEIFERT ISOVOLT 160 kV in order to allow a precise characterization of photon beams in the low energy range, according to the ISO 4037.

The brachytherapy dosimetry protocol recommended by the American Association of Physicists in Medicine was followed and evaluated for conditions of partial scatter (non-infinite media) and material inhomogeneities, both commonly encountered in brachytherapy treatment. Furthermore, energy-dependent characteristics of dosimetry parameters were evaluated and reference calculations performed for virtual photon and neutron sources. These findings were applied to three clinical brachytherapy cases: eye plaques using 103 Pd, 125 I, and 131 Cs; high-dose rate 252 Cf treatment; and, 2 Cf plaques for superficial lesions. For eye plaques, material heterogeneities were significant for each radionuclide with dose reduction at 5 mm of 18 %, 11 %, and 10 % for P 03 pd, 125 I, and 131 Cs, respectively. For a proposed highdose rate 252 Cf source (5 mm length), relative brachytherapy dosimetry parameters {{were found to be}} similar to those obtained for a low-dose rate Applicator Tube-type source (15 mm length).

The results indicate that the Advanced Markus, Markus, NACP, and Roos parallel plate ionization chambers were suitable for the measurement of depth dose data in this beam quality range with an uncertainty of less than 3 %, including in the regions close to the water surface. While the relative detector response of the Farmer and scanning thimble chambers exhibited a better energy response, they were not suitable for depth dose measurements in the first 5 mm below the water surface with differences of up to 12 % in the surface dose measurement for the 50 kVp x-ray beam. These differences were due to dose artifacts generated by the chamber size and the dose gradient. However, at depths greater than 5 mm, the Farmer and thimble scanning chambers gave uncertainties of less than 3 % for the depth dose measurements for all beam energies. The PTW PinPoint 31006 chamber was found to give varying dose differences of up to 8 % depending on the x-ray beam energy; this was attributed to the steel central electrode. The authors recommend that one of the parallel plate ionization chambers investigated be used to determine depth dose data for kilovoltage x-ray beams in the energy range studied and give correct dose information close to the surface and at depth in the water phantom. 11 page(s...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} x-ray imaging performed with a high-power laser system in biologic and medical studies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A compact terawatt laser system based on chirped pulse amplification in titanium-doped sapphire was used. X rays were generated by irradiating a high-atomic-number target (tantalum). RESULTS: When photons with an energy below 10 keV were removed with use of 3 mm of aluminum, the <b>half-value</b> <b>layer</b> in aluminum for the remaining x rays was approximately 10 mm. The x-ray source allowed performance of biologic magnification radiography. Star-pattern tests indicated an equivalent focal spot size of less than 60 mum. Exposures of a single pulse could be obtained. The duration of a single x-ray pulse {{was estimated to be}} of the order of picoseconds. CONCLUSION. With use of subpicosecond laser pulses, x-ray generation can occur with a smaller equivalent focal spot size than with conventional x-ray sources...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Objective: Derive {{filtered}} tungsten X-ray spectra used {{in digital}} mammography systems {{by means of}} Monte Carlo simulations. Materials and Methods: Filtered spectra for rhodium filter were obtained for tube potentials between 26 and 32 kV. The <b>half-value</b> <b>layer</b> (HVL) of simulated filtered spectra were compared with those obtained experimentally with a solid state detector Unfors model 8202031 -H Xi R/F & MAM Detector Platinum and 8201023 -C Xi Base unit Platinum Plus w mAs in a Hologic Selenia Dimensions system using a direct radiography mode. Results: Calculated HVL values showed good agreement as compared with those obtained experimentally. The greatest relative difference between the Monte Carlo calculated HVL values and experimental HVL values was 4 %. Conclusion: The {{results show that the}} filtered tungsten anode X-ray spectra and the EGSnrc Monte Carlo code can be used for mean glandular dose determination in mammography...|$|E
40|$|The WinXCom {{program has}} been used to {{calculate}} the mass attenuation coefficients (μm), effective atomic numbers (Zeff), effective electron densities (Nel), <b>half-value</b> <b>layer</b> (HVL), and mean free path (MFP) in the energy range 1 [*]keV– 100 [*]GeV for Gd 3 Al 2 Ga 3 O 12 Ce (GAGOC) and CaMoO 4 (CMO) scintillator materials. The geometrical progression (G-P) method {{has been used to}} compute the exposure buildup factors (EBF) and gamma ray energy absorption (EABF) in the photon energy range 0. 015 – 15 [*]MeV and up to a 40 penetration depth (mfp). In addition, the values of the removal cross section for a fast neutron ∑R have been calculated. The computed data observes that GAGOC showed excellent γ-rays and neutrons sensing a response in the broad energy range. This work could be useful for nuclear radiation sensors, detectors, nuclear medicine applications (medical imaging and mammography), nuclear engineering, and space technology...|$|E
30|$|The basic {{filtration}} of the X-ray beam (i.e. in {{the absence}} of 0.1  mm Cu) was determined from the measured <b>half-value</b> <b>layer</b> in aluminium. Since most authors had reported the entrance dose as a dose-in-air including backscatter [22, 23, 25 – 31], we followed this convention. We estimated backscatter factors for the conversion of incident air kerma to entrance dose for each age group and radiation quality using data from the NRPB report R 279 [36]. These factors were 1.26, 1.35, 1.39, 1.45 and 1.48 for the age groups 0 – 1 years, 1 – 5 years, 5 – 10 years, 10 – 15 years small childen and 10 – 15 years large children, respectively. The incident air kerma was derived by PCXMC from the KAP and the estimated unshuttered image size. Note that the dose in tissue, used in two publications [24, 33], is about 5 % higher than the entrance dose as used by most other investigators and us.|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{diagnostic}} X-ray {{units are}} used for radiographic imaging in many countries. For obtaining entrance surface doses, a numerical dose determination method has been applied in Japan. Although this technique is effective, it has to account for errors, particularly fluctuations, due to the beam quality and output of X-ray tubes. As {{a part of our}} quality control procedures, we recorded the entrance surface air kerma, tube voltage, and <b>half-value</b> <b>layer</b> measurements made for four diagnostic X-ray tubes over a 103 -week period. The entrance surface air kerma for one of the four X-ray tubes had increased significantly by 11. 4 % over 1 year from its initial setting, whereas the tube voltages and half-value layers did not deviate significantly from their initial values. Medical physicists and radiological technologists should be aware of this fluctuation for diagnostic X-ray tubes and take it into consideration when calculating the entrance surface air kerma. © 2014 Japanese Society of Radiological Technology and Japan Society of Medical Physics. 発行後 1 年より全文公...|$|E
