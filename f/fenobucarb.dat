50|$|<b>Fenobucarb</b> is a {{carbamate}} insecticide. A {{pale yellow}} or pale red liquid, insoluble in water; {{used as an}} agricultural insecticide on rice and cotton and moderately toxic for humans.|$|E
50|$|The {{so-called}} {{carbamate insecticides}} feature the carbamate ester functional group. Included {{in this group}} are aldicarb (Temik), carbofuran (Furadan), carbaryl (Sevin), ethienocarb, <b>fenobucarb,</b> oxamyl, and methomyl. These insecticides kill insects by reversibly inactivating the enzyme acetylcholinesterase. The organophosphate pesticides also inhibit this enzyme, although irreversibly, and cause a more severe form of cholinergic poisoning.|$|E
40|$|Headspace {{solid phase}} micro {{extraction}} (SPME) {{has been applied}} to six carbamate pesticides, viz. xylylcarb, XMC, isoprocarb, <b>fenobucarb,</b> propoxur and carbofuran, in human whole blood and urine. Sample solution, after mixing with sodium chloride, was heated in a vial at 70 ℃, and an SPME fiber was exposed to the headspace of the vial. Immediately after the fiber was pulled out, the fiber needle was injected into the port of a gas chromatograph with a flame ionization detector. Recoveries were 0. 582 - 1. 87 % for whole blood, and 2. 97 - 20. 6 % for urine; it was highest for <b>fenobucarb</b> and lowest for carbofuran. The detection limits were about 0. 1 - 0. 5 μg/ml of whole blood, and 0. 01 - 0. 05 μg/ml of urine. rights:日本法中毒学会rights:本文データは日本法中毒学会の許諾のもと掲載しています...|$|E
40|$|Insecticides {{are widely}} used in SE Asian {{countries}} to control insect pests in rice, mainly stemborers (Chilo suppresallis) and brown plant hoppers (Nilaparvata lugens). The use of highly toxic insecticide compounds, however, is known to cause serious problem for fish culture in wet rice fields {{in many of these}} countries, particularly in Indonesia where this practice assumes a tremendous "house hold economic" importance, as well as being {{an essential part of the}} nation's inland aqua-culture production system. The laboratory and field experiments described were carried out to establish whether the application of five selected rice insecticides (<b>fenobucarb,</b> isoprocarb, buprofezin, diazinon and alphamethrin) would influence the growth and production of common carp fingerlings (Cyprinus carpio LINN.) raised in wet rice fields. Laboratory static toxicity tests revealed that the carbamate insecticides (<b>fenobucarb</b> and isoprocarb) were the least toxic insecticide compounds.

40|$|Background: Highly {{hazardous}} organophosphorus (OP) insecticides {{are responsible}} for most pesticide poisoning deaths. As they are removed from agricultural practice, they are often replaced by carbamate insecticides of perceived lower toxicity. However, relatively {{little is known about}} poisoning with these insecticides. Methods: We prospectively studied 1288 patients self-poisoned with carbamate insecticides admitted to six Sri Lankan hospitals. Clinical outcomes were recorded for each patient and plasma carbamate concentration measured in a sample to confirm the carbamate ingested. Findings: Patients had ingested 3 % carbofuran powder (719), carbosulfan EC 25 liquid (25 % w/v, 389), or <b>fenobucarb</b> EC 50 liquid (50 % w/v, 127) formulations, carbamate insecticides of WHO Toxicity Classes Ib, II, and II, respectively. Intubation and ventilation was required for 183 (14. 2 %) patients while 71 (5. 5 %) died. Compared with carbofuran, poisoning with carbosulfan or <b>fenobucarb</b> was associated with significantly higher risk of death [carbofuran 2. 2 %; carbosulfan 11. 1 %, OR 5. 5 (95 % CI 3. 0 – 9. 8); <b>fenobucarb</b> 6. 3 %, OR 3. 0 (1. 2 – 7. 1) ] and intubation [carbofuran 6. 1 %; carbosulfan 27. 0 %, OR 5. 7 (3. 9 – 8. 3); <b>fenobucarb</b> 18. 9 %, OR 3. 6 (2. 1 – 6. 1) ]. The clinical presentation and cause of death did not differ markedly between carbamates. Median time to death was similar: carbofuran 42. 3 h (IQR 5. 5 – 67. 3), carbosulfan 21. 3 h (11. 5 – 71. 3), and <b>fenobucarb</b> 25. 3 h (17. 3 – 72. 1) (p = 0. 99); no patients showed delayed onset of toxicity akin to the intermediate syndrome seen after OP insecticide poisoning. For survivors, median duration of intubation was 67. 8 h (IQR 27. 5 – 118. 8) with no difference in duration between carbamates. Reduced GCS at presentation was associated with worse outcome although some patients with carbosulfan died after presentation with normal GCS. Conclusions: We did not find carbamate insecticide self-poisoning to vary markedly according to the carbamate ingested although the case fatality varied according to the concentration and formulation of the insecticide. Carbamate poisoning {{did not appear to be}} much less toxic than poisoning with some liquid OP insecticide formulations, e. g., chlorpyrifos EC 40, that we have previously noted in these same hospitals (Lancet 2005, 366 : 1452 – 1459; QJM 2006, 99 : 513 – 522). Replacement of WHO Class II Toxicity OP insecticides in agriculture with high-strength liquid carbamate formulations may not substantially reduce case fatality after pesticide poisoning and, therefore, global suicide rates...|$|E
40|$|A simple, rapid, {{and precise}} amperometric method for {{quantification}} of N-methylcarbamate pesticides in water samples and phytopharmaceuticals is presented. Carbofuran and <b>fenobucarb</b> are the target analytes. The method is developed in flow conditions providing the anodic oxidation of phenolic-based compounds formed after alkaline hydrolysis. Optimization of instrumental and chemical variables is presented. Under the optimal conditions, the amperometric signal is linear for carbofuran and <b>fenobucarb</b> concentrations {{over the range}} of 1. 0 * 10 - 7 to 1. 0 * 10 - 5 molL- 1, with a detection limit of about 2 ngmL- 1. The amperometric method is successfully applied {{to the analysis of}} spiked environmental waters and commercial formulations. The proposed method allows 90 samples to be analysed per hour, using 500 mL of sample, and producing wastewaters of low toxicity. The proposed method permits determinations at the mgL 1 level and offers advantages of simplicity, accuracy, precision, and applicability to coloured and turbid samples, and automation feasibility...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. The {{effects of}} {{imidacloprid}} and <b>fenobucarb</b> insecticides on {{the dynamics of}} the psyllid Diaphorina citri and on the incidence of Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (Ca. L. a.), the putative causal agent of Huanglongbing disease (HLB), were studied in a field experiment. Materials and methods. The experimental design consisted of three independent 0. 5 -ha Citrus orchards planted with disease-free HLB-susceptible orange trees, located in a Citrus producing area seriously affected by HLB. Imidacloprid was applied monthly to the trunks in one orchard at a rate of 0. 15 g a. i. ·tree – 1; <b>fenobucarb</b> was sprayed fortnightly in a second orchard at a rate of 250 g a. i. ·ha – 1. The 3 rd orchard was managed as a control without insecticide applications. The total number of adult D. citri specimens and the percentages of trees harbouring psyllid eggs and 5 th instar nymphs were monitored at fortnightly intervals in each orchard. Ca. L. a. incidence was assessed in each orchard by PCR at 5 months, 12 months and 24 months after planting. Results. Compared with the control, both the <b>fenobucarb</b> and imidacloprid treatments reduced adult psyllid populations by over 90 % and reduced the frequency of trees harbouring eggs and 5 th instar nymphs. Only imidacloprid treatments totally prevented development {{of a new generation of}} adults from eggs. Two years after planting, the prevalence of Ca. L. a. was 0. 939, 0. 745 and 0. 239 in the control and in the orchards treated with <b>fenobucarb</b> and imidacloprid, respectively. Discussion and conclusion. The results indicated that, although both the insecticides used effectively reduced D. citri populations by killing adults and nymphs and by affecting or preventing psyllid reproduction in orchards, neither of the two insecticide treatments totally prevented transmission of Ca. L. asiaticus. However, due to its long-lasting effect and systemic activity, the imidacloprid treatment provided the best protection against infections, and delayed and slowed down the spread of the pathogen. Furthermore, it reduced the number of pesticide applications needed and left the way open for biological integrated pest management programmes. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Bioremediation of {{pollutants}} {{is a major}} concern worldwide, leading to the research of new processes to break down and recycle xenobiotics and environment contaminating polymers. Among them, carbamates have a very broad spectrum of uses, such as toxinogenic pesticides or elastomers. In this study, we mined the bovine rumen microbiome for carbamate degrading enzymes. We isolated 26 hit clones exhibiting esterase activity, and were able to degrade {{at least one of the}} targeted polyurethane and pesticide carbamate compounds. The most active clone was deeply characterized. In addition to Impranil, this clone was active on Tween 20, pNP-acetate, butyrate and palmitate, and on the insecticide <b>fenobucarb.</b> Sequencing and sub-cloning of the best target revealed a novel carboxyl-ester hydrolase belonging to the lipolytic family IV, named CE_Ubrb. This study highlights the potential of highly diverse microbiota such as the ruminal one for the discovery of promiscuous enzymes, whose versatility could be exploited for industrial uses...|$|E
40|$|Carbofuran (CFN), {{carbosulfan}} (CSN) and <b>fenobucarb</b> (FBC) are carbamate pesticides {{that are}} widely used in gardening and agriculture for the control of insects. Human poisoning due to occupational or self-poisoning exposures is also reported, so assays are required to quantify the plasma concentration of these insecticides. An LC-MS/MS method was developed and validated for the simultaneous quantification of these three carbamate insecticides in the plasma of patients with acute intentional self-poisoning. Plasma samples were pretreated by acetonitrile for protein precipitation. Chromatography was carried out on a Luna C 18 (2) analytical column with gradient elution using a mobile phase containing acetonitrile and water with 10. mM ammonium acetate. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed by an Applied Biosystems MDS Sciex API 2000 triple quadrupole mass spectrometer coupled with electrospray ionization (ESI) source in the positive ion mode. The total run time was 7. min. The assay was validated over a concentration range from 10 to 1000. ng/ml for CSN and FBC and 20 - 2000. ng/ml for CFN. The precision and accuracy for both intra- and inter-day determination of all analytes were acceptable...|$|E
40|$|An {{arthropod}} {{community in}} a rice ecosystem was surveyed {{to determine the}} impact of twoinsecticides frequently used in Korean rice ecosystems: carbofuran 3 GR, which targets the rice water weevil,Lissorhoptrus oryzophilus Kuschel (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) in the early season and <b>fenobucarb</b> EC, whichtargets the brown planthopper, Nilaparvata lugens (Stål) (Hemiptera: Delphacidae) in the mid- and lateseasons, respectively. Overall, {{the application of the}} insecticides reduced density of total arthropods by 48. 4 %compared to the untreated field, but their impact on each functional group were different. Carbofuran GRtreatment on 1 June reduced the L. oryzophilus population significantly until mid-season. The population of filterfeedingchironomids was also reduced by 50 %, whereas the spider population was less disturbed. FenobucarbEC treatment on 16 August significantly reduced N. lugens and detrivorous entomobryid populationsuntil the late season. Both web-building and wandering spiders were also significantly disturbed by fenobucarbEC although the impact differed according to their behavioral differences. While the population of web-buildingspiders significantly decreased over time, that of wandering spiders recovered from the disturbance a fewweeks later...|$|E
40|$|Spiraling whitefly, Aleurodicus dispersus Russell (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae) was {{detected}} {{for the first}} time causing serious damages on pepper in South Sulawesi Province of Indonesia in 2012. Farmers rely mainly on insecticide for its control; however, this effort apparently failed to provide satisfactory control. The failure probably stemmed from inappropriate insecticide choice and application method. Thus, the purpose of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy of commercially available insecticides and application methods on suppressing the whitefly. Ten formulated insecticides with different active ingredients were evaluated in a field trial against the adult and nymphal whitefly. The same insecticides were also tried to determine their efficacy against the adult populations in a leaf-dip bioassay in the laboratory. Another field trial was conducted to compare the effectiveness of two different application methods: partial coverage spray practiced by farmers; and full coverage spray. Fipronil, lambda-cyhalothrin, <b>fenobucarb,</b> and imidacloprid consistently had the lowest numbers of adults during the trial. While, pipronil, lambda-cyhalothrin, and imidacloprid had the least numbers of nymphs. Overall, however, all insecticides were highly effective in suppressing the whitefly populations with reduction levels ranging from 85. 7 % (cypermethrin) to 99. 3 % (imidacloprid) for the nymph and 87. 8 % (cypermethrin) to 99. 7 % (imidacloprid) for the adult. Laboratory bioassay results showed that all insecticides effectively controlled the adult whitefly with mortality rates from 80 - 100 % 24 hours and 100 % 48 hours after the insecticide application. The results of the field trial comparing two application methods showed that the partial spray coverage (farmers??? method) failed to lower the whitefly population, while the full spray coverage method successfully suppressed the pest population. Therefore, the ineffectiveness of insecticides use so far was probably due to the inappropriate choices of insecticides and application method by the farmers...|$|E
40|$|The {{intensification}} of agricultural {{production in the}} Mekong Delta has faced serious challenges with respect to increased use of agrochemicals and especially pesticides. The indiscriminate use of pesticide could potentially impact on the long-term food production, environmental and human health in the delta. The aim of this thesis {{was to investigate the}} negative side effects of the current use of pesticides on climbing perch (Anabas testudineus) in rice fields using brain acetylcholinesterase (hereafter referred to as AChE) activity as a biomarker. The empirical work, on which this thesis is based, includes structured questionnaires, laboratory and field experiments. First, a field survey using questionnaires was carried out {{to gain a better understanding}} of the current state of rice farming systems, the use of pesticides and attitude to pest management strategies among rice and rice-fish farmers, as well as to provide basic information for the set-up of the laboratory and field experiments. Secondly, laboratory studies were conducted to clarify if the selected insecticides applied alone and in mixtures caused negative side effects on climbing perch fingerlings. Thirdly, further toxicity studies were carried out, under rice field conditions, to further investigate the toxicity effects of the insecticides, applied alone, in mixtures and under sequential applications, on climbing perch fingerlings. The results showed that although there were a more selective use of pesticides and an increased awareness among farmers of the negative side effects of pesticides in 2007 as compared to 1999, the current use of pesticide in the Mekong Delta still cause many problems to the environment and human health. Chlorpyrifos ethyl (hereafter referred to as CPF) was found to cause a significant and more prolonged inhibition on the brain AChE activity in climbing perch than <b>fenobucarb</b> (hereafter referred to as F). The inhibition by the mixture of CPF and F were significantly higher than the inhibition by only F, but less prolonged and significant lower than the inhibition by only CPF. The results suggest that the combined effect from a mixture of F and CPF can create both additive effects initially and later antagonistic effects. CPF and F applied at concentrations used by farmers, either as separate doses, in a mixture or in sequential doses, decreased the brain AChE activity, growth and survival rates in climbing perch. The results demonstrate that brain AChE activity in climbing perch is a relevant biomarker for monitoring of exposure to, and sub-lethal impacts from organophosphates and carbamates under tropical conditions. The result also shows that 2 -PAM re-activate the brain AChE activity, and can be used as an alternative method to assess the AChE inhibition level in organisms recently exposed to OP’s, in situation where it may be difficult to find unexposed individuals as controls. In conclusion, this thesis shows that the current use of pesticides in the Mekong Delta has a negative effect on climbing perch living in rice fields. It indicates that a sustained long-term food production in the Mekong Delta must be based on ecological principles, taking advantages of ecosystem biodiversity and productivity, and not through intensified use of pesticides.
