5|$|The band first rehearsed {{material}} <b>for</b> <b>Back</b> to the Egg in London, at {{the offices}} of McCartney's company MPL Communications in Soho Square, before carrying out further rehearsals in Scotland, in June 1978. As on his other Wings recordings over 1978–79, Thomas worked with Phil McDonald as his recording engineer, at McCartney's insistence, rather than Bill Price, who was the producer's preferred engineer.|$|E
5|$|Emerging {{technologies}} such as X-rays gave physicians new diagnostic tools, revealing the intervertebral disc as a source <b>for</b> <b>back</b> pain in some cases. In 1938, orthopedic surgeon Joseph S. Barr reported on cases of disc-related sciatica improved or cured with back surgery. As {{a result of this}} work, in the 1940s, the vertebral disc model of low back pain took over, dominating the literature through the 1980s, aiding further by the rise of new imaging {{technologies such}} as CT and MRI. The discussion subsided as research showed disc problems to be a relatively uncommon cause of the pain. Since then, physicians have come to realize that it is unlikely that a specific cause for low back pain can be identified in many cases and question the need to find one at all as most of the time symptoms resolve within 6 to 12 weeks regardless of treatment.|$|E
5|$|Farnese's attack {{achieved}} {{his goal}} of distracting the Dutch States forces from Maastricht. After the battle, the Spanish Army moved quickly to Turnhout, taking the castle of Grobbendonk on its way and appearing before Masstricht on 8 March, just six days after the battle of Borgerhout. François de la Noue followed the Spanish till Herentals with some troops, but {{when he realized that}} Farnese was to lay siege to Maastricht, {{it was too late for}} him to reinforce the city's garrison. Moreover, mutinies and defections hampered the Dutch efforts to save the city. The English soldiers under John Norrey's orders, who remained out of Antwerp, kidnapped the abbot of St. Michael's Abbey in demand <b>for</b> <b>back</b> pays, and William of Orange's had to mediate to placate them. In political terms, the battle increased the Walloon defections from the States General to the Spanish party in the following months. Emanuel Philibert de Lalaing joined the Spanish Army with 5,000 Walloon troops of the Dutch States army and expelled from Menen a garrison loyal to the States General.|$|E

5|$|Low {{back pain}} {{has been with}} humans {{since at least the}} Bronze Age. The oldest known {{surgical}} treatise – the Edwin Smith Papyrus, dating to about 1500 BCE – describes a diagnostic test and treatment for a vertebral sprain. Hippocrates (c. 460 BCE – c. 370 BCE) was the first to use a term for sciatic pain and low back pain; Galen (active mid to late second century CE) described the concept in some detail. Physicians {{through the end of the}} first millennium did not attempt back surgery and recommended watchful waiting. Through the Medieval period, folk medicine practitioners provided treatments <b>for</b> <b>back</b> pain based on the belief that it was caused by spirits.|$|E
5|$|The script {{remained}} under Columbia's shelf until {{legal issues}} {{forced them to}} withdraw. The studio was set to begin shooting a comedic send-up of Double Indemnity entitled Big Trouble. Columbia's legal department determined that the film's plot was too similar to Double Indemnity and they needed the permission of Universal Pictures, owners of the earlier film, if the film was ever to begin shooting. With Big Trouble already set to go, desperate Columbia executives phoned Universal's Frank Price to get the necessary paperwork. Price was a former Columbia executive who had been quite fond of the script <b>for</b> <b>Back</b> to the Future during his tenure there. As a result, Universal agreed to trade the Double Indemnity license {{in exchange for the}} rights to Back to the Future. Thus, the film finally had a home at Universal.|$|E
