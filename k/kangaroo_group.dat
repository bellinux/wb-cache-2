40|$|OBJETIVO: Avaliar o impacto do método canguru sobre o aleitamento materno exclusivo nos 6 primeiros meses de vida em recém-nascidos de baixo peso. MÉTODOS: Estudo prospectivo realizado com 43 bebês (23 do grupo canguru e 20 do grupo-controle) com peso OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} kangaroo care on exclusive breastfeeding in low birth weight newborns until 6 months of life. METHODS: Prospective study carried out with 43 newborns (23 allocated in the <b>kangaroo</b> <b>group</b> and 23 in a control group) weighing < 2, 000 g and staying in the neonatal unit for at least 7 days. Exclusive breastfeeding rates between the groups were compared {{until the age of}} 6 months. The chi-square test for categorical variables was used and the statistical significance level was 0. 05. RESULTS: Exclusive breastfeeding rates were higher in the <b>kangaroo</b> <b>group</b> at hospital discharge (82. 6 vs. 0 %; p = 0. 00), at 40 weeks of gestational age (73. 9 vs. 31. 6 %; p = 0. 01), at 3 months (43. 5 vs. 5. 0 %; p = 0. 005), and at 6 months (22. 7 vs. 5. 9 %; p = 0. 20). CONCLUSION: Kangaroo care showed to be a facilitator of exclusive breastfeeding for low birth weight newborns until 6 months of life...|$|E

50|$|Caughley {{continued}} his {{education at the}} University of Sydney (1960-1963) with his advisors Charles Birch (insect population ecologist) and Harry Frith (ornithologist). Frith was chief of the Australian Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) and Caughley used the CSIRO sheep station to study the ecology of kangaroos. Caughley found that <b>kangaroo</b> <b>groups</b> are formed by a random process of members coming and leaving, which was in contrast {{to what he had}} seen in red deer. He interpreted this to mean that random grouping was density dependent with increased grouping at higher densities. An approximation of density could then be found by taking the average number of individuals per group in a given area. Continuing his research he found that red kangaroos are much more drought-tolerant than grey kangaroos, which visit water three times more often. In addition he showed that grey kangaroos prefer areas of higher ground cover than do red kangaroos and that this may be a behavioural relic from when the Tasmanian wolf and Tasmanian devil overlapped in habitat with the kangaroo.|$|R

40|$|Occupational {{therapists}} {{and other health}} professionals {{are faced with the}} challenge of helping parents cope with the birth of their preterm infant and fostering parent-infant bonding and attachment. Kangaroo care, or skin to skin contact, has the potential to minimize the delay in the parent-infant attachment process and facilitate more normal infant growth and development. The present study investigated the impact of parent participation in a hospital-based kangaroo care program on time spent with their preterm infant in the NICU. Fourteen parents with preterm infants in the NICU participated in the study. The results indicated that parents who participated in the kangaroo care program spent significantly more time with their infant than the parents who did not participate in the program (p 3 ̆c. 022). In addition, parents in the <b>kangaroo</b> care <b>group</b> visited their infant more frequently than the control group (p 3 ̆c. 037). However, the mean time with baby per day did not show {{a significant difference between the}} groups (p 3 ̆c. 194). This information may assist occupational therapists in developing family-centered early intervention programs beginning in the NICU. ...|$|R

50|$|Currently most {{kangaroo}} meat is sourced {{from wild}} animals as {{a byproduct of}} population control programmes. Both the meat and the hides are sold. Although most species of macropod are protected from non-Aboriginal hunting by law, {{a small number of}} the large-sized species which exist in high numbers can be hunted by commercial hunters. This policy has been criticised by some animal rights activists. On the other hand, the kangaroo harvest is supported by a wide range of professional ecologists in Australia. Groups such as the Ecological Society of Australia, the Australasian Wildlife Management Society and the Australian Mammal Society have stated their support for <b>kangaroo</b> harvesting. Such <b>groups</b> argue that basing agricultural production systems on native animals rather than introduced livestock like sheep offers considerable ecological advantages to the fragile Australian rangelands and could save greenhouse gas emissions.|$|R
50|$|Red <b>kangaroos</b> live in <b>groups</b> of 2-4 members. The {{most common}} groups are females and their young. Larger groups {{can be found}} in densely {{populated}} areas and females are usually with a male. Membership of these groups is very flexible, and males (boomers) are not territorial, fighting only over females (flyers) that come into heat. Males develop proportionately much larger shoulders and arms than females. Most agonistic interactions occur between young males, which engage in ritualised fighting known as boxing. They usually stand up on their hind limbs and attempt to push their opponent off balance by jabbing him or locking forearms. If the fight escalates, they will begin to kick each other. Using their tail to support their weight, they deliver kicks with their powerful hind legs. Compared to other kangaroo species, fights between red kangaroo males tend to involve more wrestling. Fights establish dominance relationships among males, and determine who gets access to estrous females. Alpha males make agonistic behaviours and more sexual behaviours until they are overthrown. Displaced males live alone and avoid close contact with others.|$|R
40|$|Most {{legislation}} {{pertaining to}} non-native organisms is implicitly focussed {{at the individual}} species level. However, in some cases interspecific hybrids can be more invasive {{than any of the}} parent species. This is problematic for policy makers, and for horticulturists developing or trading in new ornamental cultivars. We explore these issues {{in the context of the}} need to manage naturalized populations of Kangaroo Paws (Anigozanthos species) in South Africa. Self-sustaining, dense populations of naturalized Kangaroo Paws occur at several localities and are highly attractive to local nectar-feeding birds. The populations show high levels of seed set with or without bird pollination. Given the known propensity of Kangaroo Paws to hybridise in their native range in Australia, and confusion about the species identity of naturalized populations in South Africa, it was essential to resolve some key taxonomic issues in the group. We constructed the first molecular phylogeny for all species of the <b>Kangaroo</b> Paw <b>group</b> (genera Anigozanthos and Macropidia; family Haemodoraceae). As previously determined by taxonomists working on herbarium specimens, naturalized populations were identified as A. flavidus. In addition, we also identified a second species, A. rufus. Relative genome size estimates for Anigozanthos species indicated that small inter-specific differences in genome sizes are positively correlated to hybrid fitness. Anigozanthos flavidus and A. rufus have relatively 'compatible' genomes and may produce fertile hybrids under field conditions. However, for species whose genome size differ more than ~ 30 %, there is little inter-specific compatibility and consequently a very low risk of producing fertile hybrids. In conclusion, we recommend that trade in Kangaroo Paws in South Africa should be temporarily restricted and that particular cultivars should first be subjected to a careful risk assessment. © 2010 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|Lumholtz's Tree-kangaroo Dendrofagus lumholtzi is {{endemic to}} the rainforests of north Queensland, Australia. Most records of D. lumholtzi are from upland forests on the Atherton Tablelands, an area -extensively cleared for agriculture. In 1997, {{residents}} of the Tablelands formed the Tree <b>Kangaroo</b> and Mammal <b>Group</b> Inc. (TKMG) {{with the aim of}} promoting the conservation of the species. The first project of TKMG was an intensive community-based survey of the distribution of D. fumholtzi. Residents of all postal districts encompassing areas of upland rainforest within the range of D. lumholtzi were sent a written questionnaire seeking details of tree-kangaroo sightings. The Malanda postal district was surveyed in 1998 while all other postal districts were surveyed in 1999. In total, 10 122 questionnaires were distributed in the survey. Nearly BOO responses were received to the survey, providing 2 36 B Sighting records of D. lumholtzi. Of these, 367 records were of dead tree-kangaroos, mostly road-kills. " The survey has provided a much more comprehensive account of the distribution of the species than was previously available. Most records of D. lumholtz; obtained in the survey were from upland forests between Atherton and Ravenshoe, particularly remnant forests in the central and western Tablelands. Although the survey methodology is biased towards areas frequented by humans, these patterns are consistent with independent surveys. The conservation of D. lumholtzi on the Tablelands would benefit from the protection of remnant forests, the restoration of habitat and a reduction in the incidence of road-kills and dog attacks on tree-kangaroos...|$|R
