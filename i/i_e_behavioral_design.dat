40|$|Five {{experiments}} {{demonstrate that}} brands cause priming effects (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>behavioral</b> effects {{consistent with those}} implied by the brand), whereas slogans cause reverse priming effects (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>behavioral</b> effects opposite to those implied by the slogan). For instance, exposure to the retailer brand name “Walmart,” typically associated with saving money, reduces subsequent spending, whereas exposure to the Walmart slogan, “Save money. Live better,” increases it. Slogans cause reverse priming effects and brands cause priming effects because people perceive slogans, but not brands, as persuasion tactics. The reverse priming effect is driven by a nonconscious goal to correct for bias and can occur without any conscious mediation (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> following subliminal exposure to the word “slogan”). These findings provide evidence that consumer resistance to persuasion can be driven by processes that operate entirely outside conscious awareness. ...|$|R

Specifically, the current study investigated the effects of acculturation and acculturation risk factors on adolescents 2 ̆ 7 global self-worth and self-perceptions of competence. Eighty-three Latino adolescents completed a series of questionnaires regarding behavioral and cognitive aspects of acculturation, acculturation risk factors (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> acculturation stress, acculturation conflict, and perceived ethnic discrimination), and perceptions of global self-worth and competence across various domains (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>behavioral</b> conduct, physical appearance, and social acceptance). Results indicated that Latino orientation and bicultural orientation on the behavioral measure of acculturation were positively associated with perceived competence regarding behavioral conduct. Additionally, acculturation stress was negatively associated with global self-worth and perceived competence regarding physical appearance and social acceptance. Similarly, acculturation conflict and perceived ethnic discrimination were negatively associated with global self-worth and perceived competence regarding behavioral conduct, physical appearance, and social acceptance. Exploratory analyses also revealed that specific cultural orientations (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> Latino orientation, orientation to mainstream U. S. culture, and bicultural orientation) on the behavioral and cognitive measures of acculturation were significant predictors of global self-worth and perceived competence regarding behavioral conduct. Additionally, the acculturation risk factors (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> acculturation stress, acculturation conflict, and perceived ethnic discrimination) were significant predictors of global self-worth and perceptions of competence across various domains (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>behavioral</b> conduct, physical appearance, and social acceptance). However, moderation analyses indicated that the effects of acculturation conflict and perceived ethnic discrimination on Latino adolescents 2 ̆ 7 global self-worth largely depended on their cultural orientation on the behavioral and cognitive measures of acculturation. For interventions aimed at improving global self-worth and perceptions of competence in Latino adolescents, these results highlight the importance of assessing acculturation and acculturation risk factors.

The results failed to support cognitive inhibition problems in ADHD. Moreover, the ability to reanalyze sentences with a temporary misinterpretation was at least partially related to working memory performance. The results challenge a unitary inhibition problem in ADHD and suggest inhibition problems do not extend to cognitive suppression in this age range...|$|R

40|$|In-session client {{involvement}} (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> {{participation in}} in-session therapeutic tasks) is hypothesized to be a necessary component of youth therapy and associated with positive outcomes. However, research on in-session client involvement has been slowed by definitional problems. At present, {{the field has}} not yet adopted a single definition of client involvement that is applicable across different theoretical orientations, which has impacted the measurement of this construct. To remedy this problem, the field needs to adopt a definition of in-session client involvement that includes important components (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>behavioral,</b> affective, and cognitive) of this construct that applies across different theoretical orientations and use this definition to guide instrument development. The current study reports on the development and initial psychometric assessment of the Therapy Process Observational Coding Scale – Involvement (TPOCS-I), an observational measure designed to capture in-session involvement for youth therapy. Treatment sessions (N = 895) were drawn from (a) 55 youth (ages 7 - 13 years; M = 9. 89, SD = 1. 71; 51. 5 % Caucasian; 58. 8 % male) who received standard cognitive-behavioral therapy, modular therapy, or usual care for youth anxiety; and (b) 51 youth (ages 7 - 14; M = 10. 35, SD = 1. 89; 86. 3 % Caucasian; 60. 8 % male) receiving standard cognitive behavioral therapy for youth anxiety. Sessions were independently scored by seven coders using observational instruments designed to assess involvement, alliance, therapist competence, and therapist interventions. Interrater reliability – intraclass correlation coefficients (2, 2) —for the item scores averaged 0. 73 (SD = 0. 08) and 0. 82 (SD = 0. 08) for the Kendall and Child STEPS samples, respectively.

40|$|Dimension {{reduction}} {{is critical in}} identifying a small set of discriminative features that are predictive of behavior or cognition from high-dimensional neuroimaging data, such as EEG and fMRI. In the present study, we proposed a novel nonlinear supervised dimension reduction technique, named PCA-SIR (Principal Component Analysis and Sliced Inverse Regression), for analyzing high-dimensional EEG time-course data. Compared with conventional dimension reduction methods used for EEG, such as PCA and partial least-squares (PLS), the PCA-SIR method can make use of nonlinear relationship between class labels (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>behavioral</b> or cognitive parameters) and predictors (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> EEG samples) to achieve the effective dimension reduction (e. d. r.) directions. We applied the new PCA-SIR method to predict the subjective pain perception (at a level ranging from 0 to 10) from single-trial laser-evoked EEG time courses. Experimental results on 96 subjects showed that reduced features by PCA-SIR can lead to significantly higher prediction accuracy than those by PCA and PLS.

A total of 428 families, consisting of {{both parents and}} two adolescents (mean age 13. 4 and 15. 2 years at Time 1) participated in a three-wave longitudinal study with annual waves. A series of path analyses were conducted using a structural equation modeling program (Mplus). Results demonstrated that, unexpectedly, parental problem drinking was in general not associated with parenting. For the younger adolescents, higher levels of both parenting and parental problem drinking were related to lower engagement in drinking over time. This implies that shared environment factors (parenting and modeling effects) influence the development of alcohol use in young adolescents.

40|$|This article verifies {{that the}} ideal free {{distribution}} (IFD) is evolutionarily stable, provided the payoff in each patch decreases with {{an increasing number}} of individuals. General frequency-dependent models of migratory dynamics that differ in the degree of animal omniscience are then developed. These models do not exclude migration at the IFD where balanced dispersal emerges. It is shown that the population distribution converges to the IFD even when animals are nonideal (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> they do not know the quality of all patches). In particular, the IFD emerges when animals never migrate from patches with a higher payoff to patches with a lower payoff and when some animals always migrate to the best patch. It is shown that some random migration does not necessarily lead to undermatching, provided migration occurs at the IFD. The effect of population dynamics on the IFD (and vice versa) is analyzed. Without any migration, it is shown that population dynamics alone drive the population distribution to the IFD.

However, the neural and physiological mechanisms underlying this impairment are entirely unknown. Here, we sought to identify, through {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} during MSL and electroencephalographic (EEG) recordings during daytime sleep, the functional correlates and physiological characteristics of this age-related motor memory deficit. As predicted, older subjects did not exhibit sleep-dependent gains in performance (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>behavioral</b> changes that reflect consolidation) and had reduced sleep spindles compared with young subjects. Brain imaging analyses also revealed that changes in activity across the retention interval in the putamen and related brain regions were associated with sleep spindles. This change in striatal activity was increased in young subjects, but reduced by comparison in older subjects. These findings suggest that the deficit in sleep-dependent motor memory consolidation in elderly individuals is related to a reduction in sleep spindle oscillations and to an associated decrease of activity in the cortico-striatal network. © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R

Behavioral abnormality {{is due to the}} increase in glucocorticoid secretion rather than disturbance of brain zinc homeostasis, which occurs after the increase in glucocorticoid secretion. A major target of glucocorticoids is the hippocampus and their actions are often associated with disturbance of glutamatergic neurotransmission, which may be linked to behavioral abnormality, such as depressive symptoms and aggressive behavior under {{zinc deficiency}}. Glucocorticoid-mediated disturbance of glutamatergic neurotransmission in the hippocampus is also involved in the pathophysiology of, not only psychiatric disorders, such as depression, but also neurodegenerative disorders, e. g., Alzheimer’s disease. The evidence suggests that zinc-deficient animals are models for behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD), as well as depression. To understand validity to apply zinc-deficient animals as a behavioral abnormality model, this paper deals with the effect of antidepressive drugs and herbal medicines on hippocampal dysfunctions and behavioral abnormality, which are induced by enhanced HPA axis activity under dietary zinc deficiency...|$|R

To {{provide a}} {{preliminary}} {{test of a}} Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) belief-based intervention to increase adolescents’ sun protective behaviors in a high risk area, Queensland, Australia. Methods. In the period of October-November, 2007 and May-June, 2008, 80 adolescents (14. 53 ± 0. 69 years) were recruited from two secondary schools (one government and one private) in Queensland after obtaining student, parental, and school informed consent. Adolescents were allocated to either a control or intervention condition based on the class they attended. The intervention comprised three, one hour in-school sessions facilitated by Cancer Council Queensland employees with sessions covering the belief basis of the TPB (<b>i.</b> <b>e.,</b> <b>behavioral,</b> normative, and control [barrier and motivator] sun-safe beliefs). Participants completed questionnaires assessing sun-safety beliefs, intentions, and behavior pre- and post-intervention. Repeated Measures Multivariate Analysis of Variance {{was used to test}} the effect of the intervention across time on these constructs. Results. Students completing the intervention reported stronger sun-safe normative and motivator beliefs and intentions and the performance of more sun-safe behaviors across time than those in the control condition. Conclusion. Strengthening beliefs about the approval of others and motivators for sun protection may encourage sun-safe cognitions and actions among adolescents. ...|$|R
