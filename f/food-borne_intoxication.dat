40|$|Toxic oil {{syndrome}} (TOS) was {{a massive}} <b>food-borne</b> <b>intoxication</b> that occurred in Spain in 1981. Epidemiological studies imputed 3 -(N-phenylamino) propane- 1, 2 -diol (PAP) derivatives as the toxic agents. The in vitro bioactivation of PAP by rat and human liver microsomes was studied. In both cases, 3 -[N-(4 ′-hydroxyphenyl) amino]propane- 1, 2 -diol (1) was detected as the main metabolite. Inhibition studies with pooled human liver microsomes in the presence and absence of P 450 -specific inhibitors suggest that 2 C 8 and 2 E 1 are the main enzymes involved in PAP bioactivation, followed by 3 A 4 / 5, 1 A 1 / 2, and 2 C 9. Incubations of PAP with 10 different recombinant P 450 enzymes showed that 2 C 8, 2 C 9, 2 C 18, 2 D 6, and 2 E 1 catalyzed PAP 4 ′-hydroxylation. Incubations of phenol 1 with rat and human liver microsomes {{in the presence of}} GSH resulted in the formation of a glutathione conjugate of a quinoneimine metabolite derived from 1. In rat liver microsomes, P 450 enzymes {{play a key role in}} the bioactivation of 1, whereas in human liver microsomes, autoxidation appears to be the major mechanism. The implications of these results for toxic oil syndrome are discussed. © 2007 American Chemical Society...|$|E
40|$|The {{epidemiology}} of clenbuterol <b>food-borne</b> <b>intoxication</b> outbreaks {{indicates a}} possible {{discrepancy between the}} severity and long duration of clinical symptoms, and the presumed dose ingested as parent compound residue. In this work, we explore the possibility that clenbuterol could undergo to a biological transformation, in presence of salivary nitrites, at gastric pH (< 3). Human salivary specimens were drawn before and after meal, accounting for the different physiological nitrite content (40 and 400 mu mol L- 1, respectively, as average). Clenbuterol (10 mu mol L- 1) was then incubated within the pH range 2 - 6 and possible products monitored by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), drawing at regular intervals serial aliquots of the incubation mixture. With respect to controls, two differential peaks were noted along with a quantitative biotransformation of the parent compound, at pH values <= 3. Under pre-meal conditions, a 4 mono-nitro compound was identified as main metabolite, whereas under post-meal condition a second metabolite, showing a complete de-chlorination, along with the probable presence of three nitro groups on the aromatic ring, was revealed. The reaction was highly reproducible and the kinetics suggested the involvement of nitrogen-related free radicals. The results {{are discussed in the}} light of the possible formation of pharmacological active tissue-bound residues as cause of symptoms seventy. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn France, human {{botulism}} {{is mainly}} <b>food-borne</b> <b>intoxication,</b> whereas infant botulism is rare. A total of 99 group I and II C. botulinum strains including 59 type A (12 historical isolates (1947 - 1961), 43 from France (1986 - 2013), 3 {{from other countries}} and one collection strain), 31 type B (3 historical, 23 recent isolates, 4 from other countries and one collection strain), and 9 type E (5 historical, 3 isolates, and one collection strain) were investigated by botulinum locus gene sequencing and MLST analysis. Historical C. botulinum A strains mainly belonged to subtype A 1 and sequence type (ST) 1, whereas recent strains exhibited a wide genetic diversity: subtype A 1 in orfX or ha locus, A 1 (B), A 1 (F), A 2, A 2 b 2, A 5 (B 2 ') A 5 (B 3 '), {{as well as the}} recently identified A 7 and A 8 subtypes, and were distributed into 25 STs. C. botulinum A 1 (B) was the most frequent subtype from food borne botulism and food. Group I C. botulinum type B in France were mainly subtype B 2 (14 out of 20 historical and recent strains) and were divided into 19 STs. Food borne botulism resulting from ham consumption during the recent period was due to group II C. botulinum B 4. Type E botulism is rare in France, 5 historical and one recent strains were subtype E 3. A subtype E 12 was recently identified from an unusual ham contamination. C. botulinum strains from human botulism in France showed a wide genetic diversity and seems to result not from a single evolutionary lineage but from multiple and independent genetic rearrangements...|$|E

40|$|SummaryThis study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the rate of Clostridium botulinum contamination in some traditional Iranian food products (cheese, kashk and salted fish) and evaluate {{the efficacy of the}} mouse bioassay method in detection of C. botulinum toxins in these foods. A total of 131 samples (57 cheese, 11 kashk and 63 salted fish) were collected and examined {{to determine the}} rate of contamination by C. botulinum. Standard monovalent anti-toxins were used to determine the types of toxin. C. botulinum bacteria were detected in 4. 58 % of the examined samples (1. 52 % of cheese and 3. 06 % of salted fish samples). While no contamination was detected in the kashk samples, C. botulinum types A and E were found to be dominant in cheese and salted fish samples, respectively. These results indicate—some traditional Iranian foods may be contaminated with different types of C. botulinum, and the consumption of these products, either raw or cooked, may contribute to <b>food-borne</b> <b>intoxications...</b>|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcal food {{poisoning}} (SFP) {{is the most}} prevalent cause of <b>food-borne</b> <b>intoxications</b> worldwide. Consumption of enterotoxins preformed in food causes violent vomiting and can be fatal in children and the elderly. While being repressed by competing bacteria in most matrices, Staphylococcus aureus benefits from crucial competitive advantages in foods with high osmolarity or low pH. During recent years, the long-standing belief in the feasibility of assessing SFP risk based on colony-forming units of S. aureus present in food products has been disproven. Instead, researchers and food business operators are {{acutely aware of the}} imminent threat arising from unforeseeable enterotoxin production under stress conditions. This paradigm shift led to a variety of new publications enabling an improved understanding of enterotoxin expression under stress conditions encountered in food. The wealth of data provided by these studies is extremely diverse, as it is based on different methodological approaches, staphylococcal strains, stressors, and enterotoxins. Therefore, in this review, we aggregated and critically evaluated the complex findings of these studies, to provide readers with a current overview of the state of research in the field...|$|R
40|$|Botulism {{is widely}} known {{to result from}} {{ingestion}} of food containing botulinum neurotoxin produced in situ by certain strains of Clostridium botulinum. Infant botulism caused by C. botulinum, unlike the <b>food-borne</b> <b>intoxication,</b> is the toxicoinfectious form of botulism (S. S. Arnon, p. 331 - 345, in G. E. Lewis, ed., Biomedical Aspects of Botulism, 1981). The strain of Clostridium baratii implicated in infant botulism produced a neurotoxin that was neutralized with antiserum for botulinum neurotoxin serotype F (J. D. Hall, L. M. McCroskey, B. J. Pincomb, and C. L. Hatheway, J. Clin. Microbiol. 21 : 654 - 655, 1985). We developed a procedure to culture the toxigenic C. baratii (strain 6341) in dialysis bags and a simple purification scheme (precipitation of 900 -ml culture supernatant with ammonium sulfate and two anion-exchange chromatographic steps at pH 5. 5 and 8. 0) that yielded up to 150 micrograms of purified neurotoxin. It is an approximately 140 -kDa single-chain protein and has the following sequence of amino acid residues at the N terminus: Pro-Val-Asn-Ile-Asn-Asn-Phe-Asn-Tyr-Asn-Asp-Pro-Ile-Asn-Asn-Thr-Thr-Ile- Leu. Comparison of this amino acid sequence {{with those of the}} botulinum neurotoxin serotypes A, B, and E showed 40 to 50 % identical residues in comparable positions. The specific toxicity of the neurotoxin, approximately 2 x 10 (6) 50 % lethal doses for mice per mg of protein injected, was not enhanced significantly by mild trypsinization, although the protease cleaved the neurotoxin within a disulfide loop that generated at least two primary fragments, approximately 47 and approximately 86 kDa, that remained linked by an interchain disulfide. These two fragments resembled the light and heavy chains of the well-characterized neurotoxin serotypes A, B, C, D, E, and F produced by C. botulinum...|$|E
40|$|An {{outbreak}} of diarrhea involving 28 patients occurred on two wards of a chronic disease hospital. The illness {{was characterized by}} abdominal cramps and watery diarrhea without vomiting or fever. An epidemiologic investigation suggested <b>food-borne</b> <b>intoxication</b> and incriminated turkey loaf served at the preceding evening meal {{as the source of}} the outbreak. Bacillus cereus was isolated both from the stool of all 14 symptomatic patients who were cultured and from turkey loaf. No other enteropathogens were found. The isolate of B. cereus was shown to elaborate an enterotoxin that caused fluid secretion in assays in the rabbit ileal loop and suck-ling mice and that also caused a positive response in the Y-I adrenal cell assay. B. cereus is an enteropathogen that should be sought in outbreaks of food-related gastroenteritis. This organism affects the gastrointestinal tract probably by the elab-oration of enterotoxins. Bacillus cereus is a ubiquitous, aerobic, spore-forming, gram-positive bacillus frequently found in food [1 - 3]. In Europe, this organism has been recognized as an important cause of food-borne outbreaks of gastroenteritis for the past 25 years [1, 4, 5]. Although outbreaks of food poisoning caused by B. cereus continue to be detected in Europe [3, 6, 7], B. cereus is an uncommonly sought and reported cause of food poisoning in the United States; only two outbreaks involv-ing 22 subjects have been reported [8, 9]. We recently encountered an {{outbreak of}} diar-rhea involving 28 patients in a chronic disease hospital. This outbreak was caused by contamina-tion of a meal with B. cereus. Since this group of patients represents the largest outbreak of this syndrome reported in the United States, the clinical and epidemiologic features of the out-break and the properties of the organism that are probably responsible for its capacity to pro-duce diarrhea were studied.

40|$|Staphylococcus aureus is {{a common}} {{bacterium}} present on skin and in mucous membranes in 20 - 30 % of healthy people. It may sometimes cause infections in humans, typically local skin and wound infections but occasionally more severe infections in the body. Some strains of this bacterium have, however, developed a resistance to beta-lactam antibiotics which includes penicillins and are used {{for the treatment of}} many infections. These are called Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Humans mainly acquire MRSA through direct contact between infected humans or contact with medical devices and equipment. MRSA is especially problematic in hospitals where patients with weakened immune systems are at greater risk of infection than the general public. A specific MRSA strain has been reported to occur in food-producing animals, most often in intensively reared pigs, veal calves and chickens, and has also been found in horses and companion animals. Reports on Biological Hazards found that food may be contaminated by MRSA, but it has not been associated with <b>food-borne</b> <b>intoxications.</b> However, in areas where MRSA prevalence in food-producing animals is high, people in contact with live animals are at greater risk of acquiring MRSA than the general population, although infections are rare...|$|R
40|$|Staphylococcus aureus {{represents}} {{the most prevalent}} cause of <b>food-borne</b> <b>intoxications</b> worldwide. While being repressed by competing bacteria in most matrices, this pathogen exhibits crucial competitive advantages during growth at high salt concentrations or low pH, conditions frequently encountered in food production and preservation. We aimed to identify reference genes {{that could be used}} to normalize qPCR mRNA expression levels during growth of S. aureus in food-related osmotic (NaCl) and acidic (lactic acid) stress adaptation models. Expression stability of nine housekeeping genes was evaluated in full (LB) and nutrient-deficient (CYGP w/o glucose) medium under conditions of osmotic (4. 5 % NaCl) and acidic stress (lactic acid, pH 6. 0) after 2 -h exposure. Among the set of candidate reference genes investigated, rplD, rpoB, gyrB, and rho were most stably expressed in LB and thus represent the most suitable reference genes for normalization of qPCR data in osmotic or lactic acid stress models in a rich medium. Under nutrient-deficient conditions, expression of rho and rpoB was highly stable across all tested conditions. The presented comprehensive data on changes in expression of various S. aureus housekeeping genes under conditions of osmotic and lactic acid stress facilitate selection of reference genes for qPCR-based stress response model...|$|R
40|$|Background: <b>Food-borne</b> <b>intoxications</b> are current {{problems}} in human society {{and most of}} them are caused by the enterotoxins of Staphylococcus aureus. Staphylococcal enterotoxin A (SEA) is the most frequently responsible for staphylococcal food poisoning outbreaks. From a food safety and human health point of view, lactic acid bacteria (LAB) may provide a promising strategy to combat the pathogenic bacteria, particularly S. aureus. Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the inhibitory activity of two commercial lactobacillus strains on growth and enterotoxin A production by S. aureus. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of these strains on gene expression of enterotoxin type A was assessed using real-time Polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Materials and Methods: In this study the inhibitory effect of two commercial probiotic strains, Lactobacillus acidophilus (LA 5) and Lactobacillus casei 01 on the growth and enterotoxin production of S. aureus was evaluated at 25 and 35 °C. The gene expression of SEA of S. aureus was also evaluated by real time (RT) PCR technique. Results: The lactobacillus strains decreased the bacterial count at both temperatures compared with the control group. This reduced effect was greater at 25 °C (3 log/CFU) than 35 °C (2 log/CFU). The production of SEA, SEC and SEE was inhibited by the lactobacillus strains. Furthermore, the gene expression of SEA was significantly suppressed in S. aureus co cultured with studied lactobacillus strains and the greatest down-regulation of sea (10. 31 fold) was observed in co-incubation of S. aureus with LC 01 at 25 °C. Conclusion: This research raises important implications for the potential use of LAB as a natural preservative in foodstuffs by correct microbial ecology of the environment and a new approach for biocontrol of S. aureus...|$|R
30|$|The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity and}} MIC were evaluated against selected bacterial strains of significant environmental and health concern, used as model of target organisms. B. cereus is an endospore-forming Gram+ bacterium {{that can cause}} food poisoning. Capable of adapting {{to a wide range}} of environmental conditions, it is distributed widely in nature and is commonly found in the soil as a saprophytic organism. As a soil bacterium, B. cereus can spread easily to many types of foods such as vegetables, eggs, meat, and dairy products, and is known to cause 2 – 5 % of <b>food-borne</b> <b>intoxications</b> due to its secretion of emetic toxins and enterotoxins. Food poisoning occurs when food is left without refrigeration for several hours before it is served. The remaining spores of contaminated food from heat treatment grow well after cooling and are the source of food poisoning. In addition, B. cereus is an opportunistic human pathogen and is occasionally associated with infections, causing periodontal diseases and other more serious infections [32]. The availability of natural substances active towards this microorganism, but well tolerated by the human body, could be useful to increase the food storage time. B. thuringiensis is a Gram+, rod shaped, and aerobic spore-forming soil bacterium producing crystalline proteins (endotoxins) that have insecticidal properties; on the other hand, this bacterial species synthesizes several enzymes and toxins that give them a wide adaptation to natural habitats [33]. The intrinsic resistance and adaptability of this bacterium makes it an ideal model for the tests performed in this research. B. amyloliquefaciens is a non-pathogenic Gram+ soil bacterium. Similar to other Bacillus species, it is capable of producing endospores allowing it to survive for extended periods of time. The species also shows some antifungal properties, which are influenced by environmental nitrogen availability. It synthesizes a natural antibiotic protein active against other photogenic Bacillus spp. and is used in agriculture, aquaculture, and hydroponics to fight root pathogens [34]. For this reason, it was important to verify if it was inhibited by secondary metabolites produced by plants. P. orientalis is a Gram−, rod-shaped bacterium placed in the P. fluorescens group. It shows antagonistic activity against several phytopathogenic bacteria [35] and as B. amyloliquefaciens can be inhibited by secondary metabolites produced by plants. S. maltophilia is an aerobic, non-fermentative, Gram− bacillus possessing flagella in a multitrichous formation, and is found naturally in the rhizosphere. However, it is also the third most common nosocomial pathogen with multi-drug resistance that targets immune-compromised patients in hospitals, making it important in medical bacteriology [36].|$|R

40|$|Food-borne illness, {{often called}} food poisoning, {{is caused by}} {{pathogens}} or certain chemicals present in ingested food. Bacteria, viruses, molds, worms, and protozoa that cause disease are all pathogens, though there are also harmless and beneficial bacteria {{that are used to}} make yogurt and cheese. Some chemicals that cause food-borne illness are natural components of foods, while others may be accidentally added during production and processing, either through carelessness or pollution. The main causes of foodborne illness are bacterial (66 %), chemical (26 %), viral (4 %) and parasitic (4 %). Intoxication and Infection The two most common types of <b>food-borne</b> illness are <b>intoxication</b> and infection. Intoxication occurs when toxins produced by the pathogen cause food poisoning. Infection is caused by the ingestion of food containing pathogens. Some people develop symptoms after ingesting a pathogen, while others never know that they are suffering from food-borne illness. The people that are most at risk are those with compromised immune systems. For these individuals, an incident of food-borne illness can be life threatening. Sanitation procedures, such as hand washing, separating at-risk foods (such as raw meat) from fresh vegetables, cooking foods, and chilling prepared foods, can help prevent food poisoning...|$|R
40|$|Salpicão de Vinhais and Chouriça de Vinhais are {{traditional}} dry-fermented meat sausages {{produced in the}} North of Portugal. The microbiological profile during production of both products was followed in three small processing units. Lactic acid bacteria were the most prevalent microorganisms, with enhanced growth during the smoking process and a consequent decrease of pH. This study demonstrated that when highly contaminated raw ingredients are used, pathogens might not be eliminated during processing (from seasoning {{until the end of}} smoking). Therefore, it is important to highlight that to produce safe Salpicão and Chouriça following traditional recipes and methodologies it is necessary to work under hygienic conditions using raw materials of good microbiological quality.

In the present study, natural antimicrobial agents from different sources, activated lactoferrin-(ALF), rosemary extract-(RE), jenseniin-G (JG) and natamycin-(NA) were used. The antimicrobial activity of agents (ALF-RE-JG) and their combinations against L. monocytogenes, E. coli O 157 :H 7 and S. Enteritidis, and NA against A. niger and P. roquefortii was tested. These antimicrobials, found effective in vitro, applied also on meat and cheese samples. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of ALF, RE and JG against pathogens were determined via disc diffusion and microtiter plate growth assay. Dipping method was applied on meat samples to test the efficacy of antimicrobials. MIC of NA was determined via disc diffusion assay. NA was applied on cheese samples to test the efficacy against both molds by dipping method. The data from microtiter well plate assay showed that ALF is effective on three pathogens. Rosemary extract inhibited only growth of L. monocytogenes and JG did not show any significant activity on the growth of same pathogens. RE enhanced the activity of ALF on E. coli O 157 :H 7. Neither individual activity nor synergistic activity was determined by disc diffusion assay. The data from disc diffusion assay revealed that the effective NA concentration on both molds was 750 ppm.
