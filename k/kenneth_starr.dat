5|$|Also in 1998, Juanita Broaddrick {{alleged that}} Clinton had raped {{her in the}} spring of 1978, {{although}} she stated she did not remember the exact date. In another 1998 event, Elizabeth Gracen recanted a six-year-old denial and stated she had a one-night stand with Clinton in 1982. Gracen later apologized to Hillary Clinton. Throughout the year, however, Gracen eluded a subpoena from <b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr</b> to testify her claim in court.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{discovery}} of the Watkins memo, and based upon a suggestion from the Office of Independent Counsel, on March 20, 1996, Attorney General Janet Reno requested that Whitewater Independent Counsel <b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr</b> expand his inquiry to specifically include the travel office affair, in particular allegations that White House employees had lied about Hillary Clinton's role in the firings, and that David Watkins or Hillary Clinton had made false statements in previous testimony to the GAO, Congress, or the Independent Counsel.|$|E

5|$|Moyer, who {{had never}} argued before the Supreme Court, {{continued}} to represent Jacobson (who was in the audience). In his brief and at oral argument, he said that a mere stated interest in sex among young men did not rise {{to a level of}} proving predisposition, that the government should have had evidence in hand that Jacobson was actually willing to break the law to do so. (<b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr,</b> then Solicitor General, had maintained in the government's brief opposing certiorari that his prior purchase of the Bare Boys magazines was all the proof it needed, even if the action were legal at the time.) Pressed on other undercover investigative techniques, he admitted that a government-run pawn shop would be a permissible way to apprehend thieves despite a lack of evidence of predisposition because the crimes might well have occurred prior to any contact with the government or its operatives.|$|E
5|$|The Whitewater {{controversy}} was {{the focus}} of media attention from the publication of a New York Times report during the 1992 presidential campaign and throughout her time as first lady. The Clintons had lost their late-1970s investment in the Whitewater Development Corporation; at the same time, their partners in that investment, Jim and Susan McDougal, operated Madison Guaranty, a savings and loan institution that retained the legal services of Rose Law Firm and may have been improperly subsidizing Whitewater losses. Madison Guaranty later failed and Clinton's work at Rose was scrutinized for a possible conflict of interest in representing the bank before state regulators that her husband had appointed. She said she had done minimal work for the bank. Independent counsels Robert Fiske and <b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr</b> subpoenaed Clinton's legal billing records; she said she did not know where they were. The records were found in the First Lady's White House book room after a two-year search and delivered to investigators in early 1996. The delayed appearance of the records sparked intense interest and another investigation concerning how they surfaced and where they had been. Clinton's staff attributed the problem to continual changes in White House storage areas since the move from the Arkansas Governor's Mansion. On January 26, 1996, Clinton became the first first lady to be subpoenaed to testify before a federal grand jury. After several Independent Counsels had investigated, a final report was issued in 2000 that stated there was insufficient evidence that either Clinton had engaged in criminal wrongdoing.|$|E

25|$|Pepperdine gained {{university}} {{status in}} 1971 {{when the school}} of law was added and the business and education departments became separate schools. In the 1980s, Pepperdine rose to prominence {{as one of the}} United States' leading centers of conservative politics, attracting many conservative-leaning professors from nearby UCLA and USC. Prominent conservatives on the Pepperdine faculty have included Bruce Herschensohn, Ben Stein, <b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr,</b> Arthur Laffer, Douglas Kmiec, and Daniel Pipes.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} {{controversial}} figures, <b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr</b> {{has been the}} subject of political satire. The book, And the Horse He Rode In On, by James Carville, attempts to portray Starr's time as special prosecutor in a comedic, negative light. At the end of his tenure at Baylor, many have called Starr a hypocrite for playing a role in covering up the Baylor Football sex scandal, considering how harshly he stood against Clinton in regards to Clinton's scandal.|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} Texas Longhorns rivalry, the Baylor rivalry {{was put on}} hold after the 2011 season with the Aggies {{decision}} to leave the Big 12 Conference. When A announced its decision to leave the Big 12 and join the SEC in 2011, then-Baylor president <b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr</b> filed suit {{in federal court in}} an attempt to block A from moving. Eventually the lawsuit was dropped, and soon thereafter, Missouri announced it was joining A in departing the Big 12 for the SEC.|$|E

Jim Guy Tucker of Arkansas.|$|R
25|$|Scaife also endowed a {{new school}} of public policy at Pepperdine University. Independent Counsel <b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr</b> was named the first dean of this school. Pepperdine has denied any {{connection}} between Scaife and the selection of Starr. Starr accepted the post in 1996, but in the ensuing controversy, he gave up the appointment in 1998 before ever having started at Pepperdine. After the investigation, Starr was appointed to head Pepperdine's law school in 2004, and became president of Baylor University in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Leach did {{not think}} that the crimes {{surrounding}} the failure of the Whitewater-tied S should have been considered in an impeachment framework. Like many in Congress, he was surprised that the Justice Department chose to refer certain sex-related charges to <b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr,</b> the Whitewater independent counsel, and even more so when Starr chose subsequently to refer certain of them to the Congress. But in what he described as a close judgment call, Leach voted for the article of impeachment that related to felonious lying under oath.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, United States Attorney General Dick Thornburgh {{resigned}} {{to run for}} a Senate seat in Pennsylvania, one made vacant by John Heinz's death in a helicopter crash. Rove's company worked for the campaign, but it ended with an upset loss to Democrat Harris Wofford. Rove subsequently sued Thornburgh alleging non-payment for services rendered. The Republican National Committee, worried that the suit would {{make it hard to}} recruit good candidates, urged Rove to back off. When Rove refused, the RNC hired <b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr</b> to write an amicus brief on Thornburgh's behalf. After a trial in Austin, Rove prevailed. Karl Rove & Co. v. Thornburgh was heard by U.S. Federal Judge Sam Sparks (who had been appointed by George H.W. Bush in 1991).|$|E

500|$|In August 1994, Independent Counsel <b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr</b> {{took over}} from Fiske in {{investigating}} Whitewater, Foster, and indirectly {{the travel office}} matter. [...] On July 22, 1995, Hillary Clinton gave a deposition under oath to the Independent Counsel that touched on travel office questions; she denied having {{had a role in}} the firings, but was unable to recall many specifics of conversations with Foster and Watkins.|$|E
500|$|Further {{investigations}} by the FBI and the Department of Justice, the White House itself, the General Accounting Office, the House Government Reform and Oversight Committee, and the Whitewater Independent Counsel {{all took}} place over the subsequent years. [...] Travel Office Director Billy Dale was charged with embezzlement but found not guilty in 1995. In 1998, Independent Counsel <b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr</b> exonerated Bill Clinton of any involvement in the matter.|$|E
2500|$|In 1994, the Capitol Steps {{performed}} at the White House for Clinton and Gore. After the Lewinsky scandal became public they were not invited to perform at the White House again, since their humor (like that of most American comedians of the time) focused on the allegations of Clinton's womanizing and coverups. The group performed for <b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr's</b> law firm. The 2000 presidential election yielded the pre-election [...] "I Want a Brand New Pair of Candidates" [...] and several other songs about the aborted recount.|$|R
50|$|On June 23, 1994 {{he pleaded}} guilty to trying to bribe David Hale.

He also received one year of probation, a $3,000.00 fine and lost his law license. The guilty plea was part of <b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr's</b> probe into {{what is known as the}} Whitewater investigation and report. He came into front page National news as a result of the Whitewater investigations. He was sentenced with his colleague Charles Matthews.|$|R
50|$|Often the {{coverage}} in the press {{can be said to}} reflect the views of the person in the street. However, more credibility is generally given to printed material than 'water cooler gossip'. The responsibility of the press to confirm reports and leaks about individuals being tried has come under increasing scrutiny and journalists are calling for higher standards. There was much debate over U.S President Bill Clinton's impeachment trial and prosecutor <b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr's</b> investigation and how the media handled the trial by reporting commentary from lawyers which influenced public opinion.|$|R
500|$|In {{the legal}} aftermath, Swidler & Berlin v. United States became an {{important}} Supreme Court decision. [...] The length, expense, and results of the Travelgate and the other investigations grouped under the Whitewater umbrella turned {{much of the public}} against the Independent Counsel mechanism. [...] As such, the Independent Counsel law expired in 1999, with critics saying it cost too much with too few results; even <b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr</b> favored the law's demise.|$|E
500|$|On June 18, 1996, Attorney General Janet Reno {{asked the}} FBI {{to look into}} it; FBI Director Louis Freeh {{acknowledged}} that both the FBI and especially the White House had committed [...] "egregious violations of privacy" [...] (in some cases the background reports contained information about extramarital affairs, trangressions with the law, and medical issues). On June 21 Reno decided it was {{a conflict of interest}} for the U.S. Department of Justice to further investigate the matter, and thus recommended that it be folded into the overall umbrella of the Whitewater investigations, under charge of Independent Counsel <b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr.</b> In any case, Starr had already begun looking into it.|$|E
500|$|In 1998, Kathleen Willey {{alleged that}} Clinton groped {{her in a}} hallway in 1993. An {{independent}} counsel determined Willey gave [...] "false information" [...] to the FBI, inconsistent with sworn testimony related to the Jones allegation. On March 19, 1998, Julie Hiatt Steele, a friend of Willey, released an affidavit, accusing the former White House aide of asking her to lie to corroborate Ms. Willey's account of being sexually groped by Clinton in the Oval Office. An attempt by <b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr</b> to prosecute Steele for making false statements and obstructing justice ended in a mistrial and Starr declined to seek a retrial after Steele sought an investigation against the former Independent Counsel for prosecutorial misconduct. Linda Tripp's grand jury testimony also differed from Willey's claims regarding inappropriate sexual advances.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr's</b> {{successor}} as Independent Counsel, Robert Ray, {{released a}} report in September 2000, that stated [...] "This office determined that the evidence was insufficient to prove to a jury {{beyond a reasonable doubt}} that either President or Mrs. Clinton knowingly participated in any criminal conduct." [...] Nevertheless, Ray criticized the White House saying that delays in the production of evidence and [...] "unmeritorious litigation" [...] by the president's lawyers severely impeded the investigation's progress, leading to a total cost of nearly $60 million. Ray's report effectively closed the Whitewater investigation.|$|R
50|$|Tucker {{was convicted}} of one count of {{conspiracy}} and one count of mail fraud on May 28, 1996 as part of <b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr's</b> investigation of the Whitewater scandal. Tucker was tried with fellow defendants James B. McDougal and his wife Susan McDougal, in the prosecution conducted primarily by OIC prosecutor Ray Jahn. Tucker chose not to testify {{in his own defense}} upon the advice of his attorney. Tucker received a lenient sentence of four years' probation and house detention in part because of his poor health. He was placed on the Mayo Clinic liver transplant list in June 1996.|$|R
5000|$|During {{his time}} in Washington, his stories often {{attracted}} the ire of the Clinton administration, and on Evans-Pritchard's departure from Washington in 1997, a White House aide was quoted in George saying, [...] "That's another British invasion we're glad is over. The guy {{was nothing but a}} pain in the ass". His efforts in ferreting out the witness, Patrick Knowlton, whose last name had been spelled [...] "Nolton" [...] in the Park Police report on Foster's death, resulted eventually in a lawsuit by Knowlton against the FBI and the inclusion of Knowlton's lawyer's letter as an appendix to <b>Kenneth</b> <b>Starr's</b> report on Foster's death. In his book, Evans-Pritchard responded vigorously to White House charges against him.|$|R
