5|$|The metro {{operates}} with a proof-of-payment system, so riders {{must have}} a valid ticket before entering the station platforms. The system is divided into zones, and the fare structure is integrated with other public transport in Copenhagen, including the buses managed by Movia, local DSB trains and the S-train. The system lies within four different zones. Ticket machines are available at all stations, where special tickets for dogs and bicycles can also be purchased. A two-zone ticket costs DKK24, and a three-zone ticket DKK36, and tickets are good for 60 minutes. Holders of the Copenhagen Card museum pass ride free of charge, as <b>do</b> <b>up</b> to two children under twelve years of age accompanied by an adult. As of 2012, the metro has fully adapted to the national electronic fare card system Rejsekort. Outside the Central zones, the outer zones are divided into sub-zones and ticketing {{can be a bit}} confusing for visitors familiar with how zones work in London or Berlin. Passengers must specify, on their ticket which sub-zone they wish to travel to.|$|E
500|$|Adams' art {{style is}} {{noted for its}} high level of detail, {{and he has a}} {{reputation}} of being a [...] "tight" [...] penciller. He states that he works at a slow pace, which limits the amount of work he does. When he penciled Fantastic Four #347–349 in 1990 for regular writer/illustrator Walter Simonson, who needed a break in order to catch up on his own work on that title, Adams managed to pencil the first two issues in five weeks and four weeks, respectively, but was considerably late on the third. In 1997 Adams stated that he could produce a page of either pencils or inks in a day. In a 2007 interview, he stated he tends to produce ⅔ to ¾ of a page a day, and can also ink at that rate, but can <b>do</b> <b>up</b> to two pages in a day if he is under pressure, as when he produced Cloak and Dagger #9 (1986) in 22 days, for example. Another example is the 1989 one-shot , which due to changing deadlines, he completed at a quicker pace. Adams singles out one page of that book that he drew a half-hour as his personal record for speed, but decries its poor quality. Adams is also noted for the humor in his work, as with, for example, the extraneous characters he places in cameo appearances in the backgrounds of his comics, as when he drew Gumby in the panels of Longshot, or the forms in which he depicted the shapeshifting alien Warlock in his The New Mutants work.|$|E

2500|$|The Nintendo DS {{version of}} Lego Rock Band {{is similar to}} the PlayStation Portable game Rock Band Unplugged and the Nintendo DS version of Rock Band 3. During each song, the player {{switches}} between the various instruments, trying to keep all four members of the band [...] "happy"; this is done by successfully completing a series of notes for the specific instrument, and then correctly hitting a final, purple note to increase that band member's happiness. Band members' happiness will fall over time, requiring the player to continually switch between band members to maintain the band's overall mood and score multiplier. The game uses the touchpad, stylus, and face buttons of the DS, and does not require or support additional peripherals like the console versions <b>do.</b> <b>Up</b> to four people can play at a time, each using a separate DS and playing their own instrument.|$|E
2500|$|Basie added {{touches of}} bebop [...] "so {{long as it}} made sense", and he {{required}} that [...] "it all had to have feeling". Basie's band was sharing Birdland with such bebop greats as Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, and Miles Davis. Behind the occasional bebop solos, he always kept his strict rhythmic pulse, [...] "so it doesn't matter what they <b>do</b> <b>up</b> front; the audience gets the beat". [...] Basie also added flute to some numbers, a novelty {{at the time that}} became widely copied. Soon, his band was touring and recording again. The new band included: Paul Campbell, Tommy Turrentine, Johnny Letman, Idrees Sulieman, and Joe Newman (trumpet); Jimmy Wilkins, Benny Powell, Matthew Gee (trombone); Paul Quinichette and Floyd [...] "Candy" [...] Johnson (tenor sax); Marshal Royal and Ernie Wilkins (alto sax); and Charlie Fowlkes (baritone sax). Down Beat magazine reported, [...] "(Basie) has managed to assemble an ensemble that can thrill both the listener who remembers 1938 and the youngster who has never before heard a big band like this." [...] In 1957, Basie sued the jazz venue Ball and Chain in Miami over outstanding fees, causing the closure of the venue.|$|E

2500|$|On Sunday 13 October {{experienced}} sailor Lieutenant Commander Peter Eden {{volunteered to}} accompany Crowhurst {{on his last}} leg from Cowes to Teignmouth. Crowhurst {{had fallen into the}} water several times while in Cowes, and as he and Eden climbed aboard Teignmouth Electron, he once again ended up in the water after slipping on the outboard bracket on the stern of the rubber dinghy. Eden's description of his two days with Crowhurst provides the most expert independent assessment available for both boat and sailor {{before the start of the}} race. He recalls that the trimaran sailed immensely swiftly, but could get no closer to the wind than 60 degrees. The speed often reached 12 knots, but the vibrations encountered caused the screws on the Hasler self-steering gear to come loose. Eden said, [...] "We had to keep leaning over the counter to <b>do</b> <b>up</b> the screws. It was a tricky and time consuming business. I told Crowhurst he should get the fixings welded if he wanted it to survive a longer trip!" [...] Eden also commented that the Hasler worked superbly and the boat was [...] "certainly nippy." ...|$|E
