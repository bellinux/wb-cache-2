5|$|Distressed by the {{occupation}} of Khafji, Saudi commander General Khaled bin Sultan appealed to American General Norman Schwarzkopf for an immediate air campaign against Iraqi forces {{in and around the}} city. However this was turned down because the buildings would make it difficult for aircraft to spot targets without <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> <b>close.</b> It was instead decided that the city would be retaken by Arab ground forces. The task fell to the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 7th Battalion, composed of Saudi infantry and two Kuwaiti tank companies attached to the task force. These were supported by U.S. Army Special Forces and Marine Reconnaissance personnel.|$|E

By season two, with Whitney's departure, Lana and Clark begin to grow closer. Clark's dishonesty over the secrets he is hiding causes their relationship to end. Lana then grew closer to Lex Luthor. Eventually, Lana learns the truth about Clark and they get back together. After stealing a kryptonite-powered suit from Lex, Lana absorbs {{an enormous amount of}} kryptonite radiation, which prohibits her from <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to Clark, and she leaves Smallville for good, but vowed to continue to use her powers to preserve life.|$|E
5|$|Megan {{receives}} backlash from Kate for {{not following}} procedure, but clay found in both Lizzy and Joe's pockets match. Samantha realizes that Joe found {{the crime scene}} of Lizzy's murder; the tennis courts at her school. Kate and Megan study her body and find a hand impression on her back, which matches {{one of her friends}} Heather Clayton (Meg Chambers Steedle). Heather killed Lizzy after she broke her finger during a lacrosse game. Lizzy's body was found elsewhere, meaning Heather had help moving the body, so Megan finds out that Lou helped Heather. Lou also admits killing Joe, as he was <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the truth. After they arrest them, Megan revisits her mother Joan, asking to exhume her father’s body. Joan declines the request, telling Megan to leave him be. Megan and Samantha revisit Helen and Becky, revealing that Joe had an undiagnosed brain disorder, causing the emotional distance from the two, telling them that Joe helped solve the Lizzy Adler case.|$|E

25|$|French {{genuinely}} {{hoped for}} a breakthrough at Neuve Chapelle (10–12 March 1915) and personally briefed the cavalry commanders Allenby and Rimington beforehand, although, aware {{of the effect of}} modern firepower on cavalry, he cautioned Rimington against <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the enemy. He believed that victory would prove to Kitchener that British efforts should be concentrated on the Western Front, {{and that it would be}} merely a prelude to a much larger Battle of Lille. French moved to a forward headquarters at Hazebrouck during the battle.|$|E
25|$|The {{object of}} the wiring parties was {{to slow down the}} enemy’s attack, while {{speeding}} up their own. For this reason, workers attempted to make it impossible for the enemy to get to their trench, while sabotaging the enemy’s wire for their own benefit. In addition, though the distance between trenches varied between 7 and 500 yards, workers tried to erect barbed wire defences as far away from their trench as possible, to prevent the enemy from <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the trench, or possibly lobbing in grenades.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to having a diffusive effect on ion transport, water molecules also form hydration shells around individual ions due to their polar nature. The hydration shell not only shields the charge on ions from other ions but also modulates the ion radial distribution function causing the formation of peaks and troughs. The average minimum distance between two ions is increased as there is always at least one layer of water molecules present between them, acting as a physical deterrent preventing two ions from <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to each other, {{in a manner that}} is similar to the short-range repulsive component of the Lennard-Jones potential.|$|E
25|$|On 5 November, a {{representative}} of the Northern Fleet General Staff told the Russian NTV television station that the sinking was caused by a collision, and Motsak repeated this assertion on 17 November {{in an interview with the}} Russian newspaper Izvestia.

25|$|Kent State/Cambodia Incursion Protest, Washington, D.C.: A {{week after}} the Kent State {{shooting}}s, on May 4, 100,000 anti-war demonstrators converged on Washington, D.C. to protest the shooting {{of the students in}} Ohio and the Nixon administration's incursion into Cambodia. Even though the demonstration was quickly put together, protesters were still able to bring out thousands to march in the Capital. It was an almost spontaneous response to the events of the previous week. Police ringed the White House with buses to block the demonstrators from <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the executive mansion. Early in the morning before the march, Nixon met with protesters briefly at the Lincoln Memorial but nothing was resolved and the protest went on as planned.|$|E

By nine, she was a smoker; she denies claims that smoking has affected her voice. At 11, she moved with her family {{to the city of}} Saskatoon, which she considers her hometown. She responded badly to formal education, preferring a freethinking outlook, and was drawn to art, a pursuit often regarded as peripheral at the time. One unconventional teacher did manage to make an impact on her, stimulating her to write poetry, and her first album includes a dedication to him. In twelfth grade, she flunked out (though she later picked up her studies) and hung out downtown with a rowdy set until deciding that she was <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to the criminal world.|$|E

The two became close, but Maxine learned he was not legally divorced from his wife and he had two children: Courtney Messina (Jossara Jinaro) and Raul Messina (Tito Ortiz). Ignacio's mother hated Maxine, which she found extremely funny. Maxine refused to date him when she learned his divorce wasn't final. They continued their friendship bound by a complicated set of rules Maxine established to prove they weren't dating. He remained very supportive during Maxine's health problems. When his divorce became final, they began dating again in a complicated relationship. At one point Maxine thought they were <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> and she actually gave him away to her friend Patsy. She later regretted it and asked Ignacio to dump Patsy. He refuses to live by Maxine's ever changing rules and confronts her with a marriage proposal as a solution, which she accepts.|$|E

2500|$|Local {{police are}} {{authorized}} {{to kill the}} animals if they {{pose a threat to}} public safety, which in practice almost only means that the animal is <b>getting</b> <b>too</b> <b>close</b> to a highway.

In cases where no threat to the public seems imminent, DEP officials will usually try to tranquilize the animal or harass them into a nearby woods (sometimes by banging on pots or forming a line to try to scare the animal away). [...] In 2008, state authorities knocked out a year-old female moose in New Britain with a tranquilizer dart and released it on state forest land in northern Connecticut. [...] Moose are generally reclusive, but male moose tend to wander about in the fall, during their mating season, and year-old moose tend to wander when their mothers get ready to give birth to new calves, according to the state Department of Environmental Protection. The 2008 New Britain moose, for example, was thought by officials to be the same animal seen in Avon and Farmington the week before.|$|E
