Semen Bosowa Maros is interesting, {{because the}} company {{is the only one}} {{national}} cement company which until now owned by national investors [...] It???s performance from time to time continue to improve, reflected in the growth of market share in the national cement market, continuing to increase. As the implications of business plans and implementation of business strategies that accordance with the norms and practices of a growing business needs. The important factors, caused the company implement the marketing distribution strategy of cement optimally through the strategy of the <b>Free</b> <b>on</b> Board (FOB) and strategy <b>on</b> <b>Free</b> <b>on</b> <b>Truck</b> type B (FOT type B). In both cement distribution strategy as the best because provide the most value the Average Revenue per Output for company than the distribution strategy of <b>Free</b> <b>on</b> <b>Truck</b> type A (FOT type A). Keywords: Market Share, Distribution strategy of cement, <b>Free</b> <b>on</b> <b>Truck</b> type B, <b>Free</b> <b>on</b> Board, <b>Free</b> <b>on</b> <b>Truck</b> type A, and Average Revenue per Output...|$|R

Although {{production}} of prewar models continued, a new model, the Tatra T600 Tatraplan was designed—the name celebrating the new Communist planned economy and the aeroplane inspiration (Colloq.
