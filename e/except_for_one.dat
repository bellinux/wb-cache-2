5|$|Arcadelt {{remained}} in Rome {{as a singer}} and composer at the Sistine Chapel until 1551, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> leave of absence to visit France in 1547. During this period, probably in early 1542, he made the acquaintance of Michelangelo, but his madrigalian settings {{of two of the}} artist's sonnets were received with indifference; indeed, from Michelangelo's letters on the topic, he probably considered himself unmusical and incapable of appreciating Arcadelt's work. Michelangelo paid Arcadelt with a piece of satin suitable for making into a doublet.|$|E
5|$|Baldwin became Bishop of Worcester on 10 August 1180. While at Worcester, he {{impressed}} King Henry II by {{intervening in}} a secular case {{to prevent a}} hanging on a Sunday. Although the medieval writer Walter Map said that Baldwin was determined to continue writing even after his election to the bishopric, none of Baldwin's writings can be dated to his time as bishop <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> sermon.|$|E

Pierce Brosnan and Sean Bean did all the stunts themselves, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> take where one is thrown against the wall. Brosnan injured his hand while filming the extending ladder sequence, making producers delay his scenes and film the ones in Severnaya earlier.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several months, Davis' unit {{undertook}} patrol and escort missions in the Cape Gloucester area and around the islands of Saidor, Manus, and Momote. Through May, these actions were relatively uneventful, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> fighter sweep mission from Wewak. Davis flew 69 missions from May to August, including several dive-bombing attacks on Japanese positions on Hansa Bay. Davis then flew another 40 missions from September to November, including six patrols between Wakde Island and Hollandia. On November 14, Davis was promoted to the temporary rank of captain.|$|E

He intended the last wall to present a contrast to the other illustrations of the staircase. Whereas the painting Gustav Vasa enters Stockholm 1523 presented a midsummer theme with a triumphant king, Larsson wanted the last illustration to be a midwinter theme with a king who sacrificed himself for his people.|$|E

As secretary, Stone took a leading part in organizing and setting the agenda for the national conventions throughout the decade.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} the {{supplies}} and reinforcements carried on Thétis to reach the Caribbean may have {{had an effect on}} the outcome of the subsequent invasion of Martinique in January 1809. <b>Except</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> reinforcement frigate, Amphitrite, none of the subsequent French efforts to transport supplies or soldiers to Martinique were successful, and a large British expeditionary force was able to overwhelm the island's poorly-supplied defenders in a brief campaign. The tightening blockade also affected other French colonies, preventing the despatch of food and military supplies and contributing to the captures of both Île de France and Guadeloupe in 1810.|$|E

Along the Pacific coast in Colombia and Ecuador, it is found on the coastal plain and the adjacent foothills of the Andes. The southernmost known record is in far southwestern Ecuador, but the species may well range into nearby Peru.|$|E
5|$|Within these {{premises}} Bruce housed his meteorological and oceanographic equipment, {{in preparation}} for future expeditions. He also met there with fellow-explorers, including Nansen, Shackleton, and Roald Amundsen. His main task, however, was masterminding {{the preparation of the}} SNAE scientific reports. These, at considerable cost and much delay, were published between 1907 and 1920, <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> volume—Bruce's own log—that remained unpublished until 1992, after its rediscovery. Bruce maintained a wide correspondence with experts, including Sir Joseph Hooker, who had travelled to the Antarctic with James Clark Ross in 1839–43, and to whom Bruce dedicated his short book Polar Exploration.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 962 {{vehicles}} were produced from 1942 to 1943. It {{had originally been}} planned that Britain would receive all of the examples produced through Lend-Lease, intending to use them in the Western Desert, {{but by the time}} they arrived the campaign was over. Additionally, the purpose-built M10 tank destroyer, armed with a 3-inch gun (and later a 17-pounder gun in British service) had begun to enter production. As a result, the British transferred 650 half-tracks to the Soviet Union under the Soviet Aid Program. Britain retained 30 and the remainder were taken by the US; <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> kept by the U.S. Army, these British and American vehicles were converted back to standard M3 Half-tracks.|$|E

5|$|After the conflict, the Pakistani {{government}} {{decided on a}} policy of silence regarding the rapes. They set up the Hamoodur Rahman Commission, a judicial commission to prepare {{an account of the}} circumstances surrounding the atrocities of the 1971 war and Pakistan's surrender. The commission was highly critical of the army. The chiefs of staff of the army and the Pakistan Air Force were removed from their positions for attempting to interfere with the commission. The Commission based its reports on interviews with politicians, officers and senior commanders. The final reports were submitted in July 1972, but all were subsequently destroyed <b>except</b> <b>for</b> <b>one</b> held by Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, the Pakistani president. The findings were never made public.|$|E

He later taught there at the same institute {{as a professor of}} theoretical physics between 1912 and 1914 before he left for Berlin. In 1901, after being stateless for more than five years, Einstein acquired Swiss citizenship, which he kept {{for the rest of his}} life. In 1905, Einstein was awarded a PhD by the University of Zürich. The same year, his annus mirabilis (miracle year), he published four groundbreaking papers, which were to bring him to the notice of the academic world, at the age of 26.|$|E

His set of Scherzi musicali was published in Venice in 1632. In 1631, Monteverdi {{was admitted to the}} tonsure, and was ordained deacon, and later priest, in 1632. Although these ceremonies took place in Venice, he was nominated {{as a member of the}} clergy of Cremona; this may imply that he intended to retire there.|$|E
