2500|$|Some {{therapeutic}} approaches developed {{out of the}} European {{school of}} existential philosophy. Concerned mainly with the individual's ability to develop and preserve a sense of meaning and purpose throughout life, major contributors to the field (e.g., Irvin Yalom, Rollo May) and Europe (Viktor Frankl, Ludwig Binswanger, Medard Boss, R.D.Laing, Emmy van Deurzen) attempted to create therapies sensitive to common [...] "life crises" [...] springing from the essential bleakness of human self-awareness, previously accessible only through the complex writings of existential philosophers (e.g., Søren Kierkegaard, Jean-Paul Sartre, Gabriel Marcel, Martin Heidegger, Friedrich Nietzsche). The uniqueness of the patient-therapist relationship thus also forms a vehicle for therapeutic inquiry. A related body of thought in psychotherapy started in the 1950s with Carl Rogers. Based also on the works of Abraham Maslow and his hierarchy of human needs, Rogers brought person-centered psychotherapy into mainstream focus. The primary requirement was that the client be in receipt of three core [...] "conditions" [...] from his counselor or therapist: unconditional positive regard, sometimes described as [...] "prizing" [...] the client's humanity; congruence and empathic understanding. This type of interaction was thought to enable clients to fully experience and express themselves, and thus develop according to their innate potential. Others developed the approach, like Fritz and Laura Perls {{in the creation of}} Gestalt therapy, as well as Marshall Rosenberg, founder of Nonviolent Communication, and Eric Berne, founder of transactional analysis.

50|$|The {{objective}} of Gestalt therapy is {{to enable the}} client to become more fully and creatively alive and to become free from the blocks and unfinished business that may diminish satisfaction, fulfillment, and growth, and to experiment with new ways of being.For this reason Gestalt therapy falls within the category of <b>humanistic</b> <b>psychotherapies.</b> Because Gestalt therapy includes perception and the meaning-making processes by which experience forms, {{it can also be}} considered a cognitive approach. Because Gestalt therapy relies on the contact between therapist and client, and because a relationship can be considered to be contact over time, Gestalt therapy can be considered a relational or interpersonal approach. Because Gestalt therapy appreciates the larger picture which is the complex situation involving multiple influences in a complex situation, it can be considered a multi-systemic approach. Because the processes of Gestalt therapy are experimental, involving action, Gestalt therapy can be considered both a paradoxical and an experiential/experimental approach.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} the results of a research study that aimed to validate a transversal competences training program, which applies techniques specific to <b>humanistic</b> <b>psychotherapies.</b> The first two steps were to develop an Assessment Scale with Behavioral Anchors for evaluating the technical and contextual performance and a competence-profile the graduated young person needs in order to attain success in career, in the context of Romanian organizational environment. The research sample included a number of 120 young adults with no basic qualification, aged between 18 and 20. We used three measures: California Personality Inventory (6 scales: sociability, responsibility, communality, achievement via independence, intellectual efficiency, and flexibility), Revised NEO Personality Inventory, and Assessment Scale with Behavioral Anchors. The transversal competences training program for young adults with no basic qualification targets the personal development of the individual, its personal growing, by adapting its life philosophy to the requests of the organizational environment; these achievements have the quality of motivating the young adult {{to go back to school}} and achieve a professional qualification...|$|R
40|$|The {{essence of}} the {{humanistic}} and existential approaches to psychotherapy is a commitment to conceptualizing, and engaging with people in a deeply valuing and respectful way. Hence, within these approaches, there is an emphasis on viewing clients' behaviors as meaningful and freely chosen; {{and there is also}} a belief that clients have the capacity to become aware of the reasons for their thoughts, feelings and behaviors. Phenomenological exploration is thus a central element of many existential and <b>humanistic</b> <b>psychotherapies,</b> and this requires psychotherapists to put to one side their therapeutic techniques and interpretative assumptions and to listen to clients in an in-depth, non-analytical way. From an existential and humanistic standpoint, however, this valuing of human beings also extends to the psychotherapist's own humanity. Hence, within these approaches, there is an emphasis on the psychotherapists themselves being genuine in the psychotherapeutic encounter, and being willing to meet their clients at a level of "relational depth. " Existential and humanistic practices may not be appropriate for all clients and all psychotherapists, but it is concluded that the principles underlying these approaches are of universal relevance to the practice of psychotherapy...|$|R

50|$|To {{develop the}} approach, Johnson and Greenberg began {{reviewing}} videos of sessions of couples therapy to identify, through observation and task analysis, {{the elements that}} lead to positive change. They were influenced in their observations by the <b>humanistic</b> experiential <b>psychotherapies</b> of Carl Rogers and Fritz Perls, both of whom valued (in different ways) present-moment emotional experience for its power to create meaning and guide behavior. Johnson and Greenberg saw the need to combine experiential therapy with the systems theoretical view that meaning-making and behavior cannot be considered outside of the whole situation in which they occur. In this combined experiential-systemic approach to couples therapy, as in other approaches to systemic therapy, the problem is viewed as belonging not to one partner, but rather to the cyclical reinforcing patterns of interactions between partners. Emotion is viewed {{not only as a}} within-individual phenomena, but also as part of the whole system that organizes the interactions between partners.|$|R
40|$|What is {{psychotherapy}} and its goal? For a <b>humanistic</b> psychotherapist, <b>psychotherapy</b> is a qualitative, phenomenological {{relationship between}} therapist and client {{in which the}} goal of therapy is to provide the appropriate milieu in which the client can activate the self-actualizing tendency. For a humanistic therapist, {{the quality of the}} client-therapist relationship is paramount in the facilitation of client growth. Indeed, Rogers (1961) no longer asks the question “How can I treat or cure this person?”, rather now asks the question: “How can I provide a relationship which this person may use for his own personal growth? ”. Rogers (1961) believes that “change comes about through experience in a relationship, ” therefore, humanistic-existential therapy focuses on the process of the therapeutic relationship and, ultimately, the client’s phenomenological and ontological process. The three primary therapist ingredients in the therapeutic relationship which fosters growth in a person are empathy, unconditional positive regard and congruence although Rogers broadened his hypothesis to include these ingredients as necessary for growth in any relationship. When the therapist provides this type of relationship for the client, Rogers believes that “change and constructive personal development will invariabl...|$|R

25|$|The {{basis of}} this {{approach}} is to look at mental illness or distress {{from the perspective of a}} spiritual crisis. Spiritual interventions focus on developing a sense of meaning, purpose and hope for the person in their current life experience. Spiritual interventions involve listening to the person's story and facilitating the person to connect to God, a greater power or greater whole, perhaps by using meditation or prayer. This may be a religious or non-religious experience depending on the individual's own spirituality. Spiritual interventions, along with psychosocial interventions, emphasize the importance of engagement, however, spiritual interventions focus more on caring and 'being with' the person during their time of crisis, rather than intervening and trying and 'fix' the problem. Spiritual interventions tend to be based on qualitative research and share some similarities with the <b>humanistic</b> approach to <b>psychotherapy.</b>|$|R

Following a task analytic methodology, the current study used both rational and empirical strategies to investigate how highly present therapists manifest presence behaviourally. Results {{from the present study}} show that therapist presence is linked to a constellation of verbal and non-verbal markers that reflect four modes of expression, which were named ‘here’, ‘now’, ‘open’, and ‘communion’.
