5|$|In February 2013, the Michigan Department of Civil Rights (MDCR) filed a {{complaint}} with the US Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights (OCR). MDCR's complaint asserted that new research clearly establishes that use of American Indian imagery negatively impacts student learning, creating an unequal learning environment in violation of Article VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. In June 2013, the OCR dismissed the case on the basis that the legal standard required not only harm, but the intent to <b>do</b> <b>harm,</b> which was not established.|$|E

25|$|On December 20, {{a similar}} note {{was found in}} a {{bathroom}} at W. R. Myers High School in nearby Taber, Alberta, indicating a student's intent to <b>do</b> <b>harm</b> on December 21. With a student attendance of roughly 20%, classes proceeded without incident. In 1999, a student opened fire at W. R. Myers, killing one student and seriously wounding another. In 2000, LCI was locked down after two youths were arrested and two firearms were seized.|$|E
25|$|To {{prevent that}} kind of damage, all life forms that use iron bind the iron atoms to proteins. This binding allows cells to benefit from iron while also {{limiting}} its ability to <b>do</b> <b>harm.</b> Typical intracellular labile iron concentrations in bacteria are 10-20 micromolar, though they can be 10-fold higher in anaerobic environment, where free radicals and reactive oxygen species are scarcer. In mammalian cells, intracellular labile iron concentrations are typically smaller than 1 micromolar, less than 5 percent of total cellular iron.|$|E
25|$|Adult weevils create brown, rice-sized feeding pits. They chew {{through the}} leaf epidermis, and if {{prolonged}} feeding continues can create small {{holes in the}} leaves. Large weevil infestations can also cause severe leaf browning. Weevil larvae are internal miners and will eat the midrib of the leaf as they mature. Mined leaves will eventually break if enough injury occurs. While these weevils <b>do</b> <b>harm</b> foliage they shouldn’t affect the overall health and longevity of established trees. They are often more of a nuisance than a serious problem and generally only create aesthetic harm.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the best}} known means by which the cunning folk opposed {{witchcraft}} was through the use of witch bottles; ceramic bottles containing such items as urine, nails, hair and nail clippings which it was believed, when put together, would cause harm to the malevolent witch. Another commonly used method was to take the heart of an animal, and to pierce it with pins, in order to <b>do</b> <b>harm</b> to the witch, whilst other cunning folk preferred to make dolls of the witch out of rags and other materials and then pierce them with pins, again with the intention of inflicting physical harm on the witch, and breaking their bewitchment.|$|E
25|$|Anyanwu is the Wild Seed’s {{black female}} protagonist that is born in Africa with genetic {{mutations}} that endow her with immortality and physical strength. She also possesses a preternatural ability {{to heal the}} sick and injured, including herself. Anyanwu is a “shape-shifter,” someone who is capable of altering her cells {{to create a new}} identity such as a different body, sex, age, or even species− metamorphoses she calls upon when needed to assure her survival. Although she has the ability to <b>do</b> <b>harm,</b> Anyanwu is a highly moral woman with a strong sense of humanity. Important to Anyanwu are family and community, autonomy and companionship, love and freedom, all of which are threatened when she meets Doro.|$|E
25|$|The {{story is}} told by two {{alternating}} first person narrators. One of them is Roy Hubert Straitley, a 65-year-old Classics master who has devoted all his life to St Oswald's and who now, {{nearing the end of}} his professional career, finds himself the last surviving member of the dying breed of classics teachers. The other narrator is the perpetrator, whose identity is only revealed in the final part of the book, and whose plotting the reader is able to follow first hand. Time and again, flashbacks detail the second narrator's childhood, adolescence and young adulthood, thus giving a fully rounded picture of a deranged mind and explaining why someone should want to demolish a school's reputation and <b>do</b> <b>harm</b> to members of the staff.|$|E

25|$|Anti-Chinese {{sentiment}} {{during the}} Cold War was largely {{the result of}} the Red Scare and McCarthyism. McCarthyism coincided with increased popular fear of communist espionage consequent to the Chinese Civil War and China's involvement in the Korean War. During the era, suspected Communists were imprisoned in the hundreds, and some ten or twelve thousand lost their jobs. Many of those who were imprisoned, lost their jobs or were questioned by committees, did in fact have a past or present connection of some kind with the Communist Party. But for the vast majority, both the potential for them to <b>do</b> <b>harm</b> to the nation and the nature of their communist affiliation were tenuous. Among these victims were Chinese Americans, who were suspected of being affiliated with the Communist Party of the People's Republic of China.|$|E
25|$|Designed to {{meet the}} {{training}} requirements of a company-sized unit in an urban environment, Military Operations in Urban Terrain (MOUT) Site Calero includes 48 buildings constructed from connex containers up to two stories high, {{with a mixture of}} rubble and complete structures. The layout includes a residential area, school, marketplace, and worship area. Soldiers learn how to clear rooms and buildings in built-up areas, conduct house-to-house searches by foot in hostile urban areas and distinguish between the characteristics of an innocent civilian and an embedded insurgent aiming to <b>do</b> <b>harm.</b> The MOUT also includes a building used for training classes and after-action review sessions. The site is named in honor of Maj. Jeffrey R. Calero of Queens Village, N.Y.

25|$|In this section, Rousseau expresses {{his belief}} that actors and actresses {{themselves}} are people of an undesirable lifestyle and potentially weak moral foundation. Rousseau describes them as scandalous, hedonistic, and compares them to jesters, who were more blatantly indecent and obscene. Once again looking to Greece and Rome as an ideal, he says that Sparta did not tolerate theatres, and Rome considered the acting profession dishonourable. He writes that the actor is someone who is artificial, performs for money, subjects himself to disgrace, and abandons {{his role as a}} man. Though the actor is not necessarily malevolent with his talents of deception, Rousseau goes on, the seductive, manipulative nature of acting could potentially be used by actors to <b>do</b> <b>harm</b> in society outside of the theatre. It is also problematic, according to Rousseau for women and men to be working together as actors and actresses. Because of the natural respect men have for the moral sense and timidity of women, for men to be amongst women as actresses will be a further threat to men's morality.|$|E

25|$|Sigismund {{confirmed}} the contracts of lease {{made with the}} Mennonites and on 20 October 1623, accorded special privileges to the lace-makers originating from Scotland, {{most of whom were}} Mennonites. But he refused to grant them any new rights or liberties. Upon the complaint of the city council of Elbing (Elbląg) that the Mennonites broke up marriages without having previously informed the authorities, married one another, and divided property at their pleasure, he forbade the Mennonites, upon penalty of a fine of 100 guilders, to marry without the foreknowledge of the authorities, and ordered that the Mennonites should be given no special rights. When the Mennonites nevertheless requested release from all civil handicaps, especially from military defense {{of the city and the}} court oath, he decreed on 26 April 1615, that they should do their duty like others. But the ruling was not enforced. On 26 April 1626, the king sent the following orders to the magistrate of Elbing, because he had heard that they had accepted Anabaptists and Mennonites and given them liberties, so that they, without swearing to him and the city, carried on trade and crafts, bought properties and food from the citizens, and tolerated them free of all that citizens must assume, and, what was not the least, their testimony at court was counted as valid as an oath, all of which is contrary to the public and special laws and offended his royal regard sorely and threatened to <b>do</b> <b>harm,</b> therefore these people were held to sworn obligations to the king and the city, to take up all civil burdens. Sigismund placed wild hordes of Poles and German mercenaries at the disposal of his brother-in-law, Ferdinand II of Austria, which burned and sacked the Hutterite villages at Schädowitz, Watznobis, and Goding, killing thousands.|$|E
500|$|One of Wollstonecraft's most scathing criticisms in the Rights of Woman {{is against}} false and {{excessive}} sensibility, particularly in women.

But reason and feeling are not independent for Wollstonecraft; rather, she believes that they should inform each other.

500|$|Reviewing the {{divergent}} narratives on {{the identity}} of the self-immolation victims, historian David Ownby concluded that [...] "although the arguments of Falun Gong practitioners seem cogent, {{it is very difficult to}} arrive at a final judgment about the self-immolation.... there are desperate people in China (and elsewhere) who will do anything for money (which would go to their families in this case, one supposes, unless the authorities had promised to rescue them before the flames could <b>do</b> <b>harm).</b> Or the entire event could have been staged.
