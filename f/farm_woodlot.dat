40|$|The {{development}} of <b>farm</b> <b>woodlots</b> {{as an alternative}} source of livelihood for smallholder farmers in diverse biophysical and socio-economic conditions is a challenging issue in developing countries, such as Rwanda, {{where the majority of}} the population relies on subsistence farming. There is a need to understand why and when farmers decide to grow trees and <b>woodlots</b> on their <b>farms.</b> The objective of this study was to analyse the determinants and the purposes that enhance the propensity to grow woodlots in low, medium and high altitude regions of Rwanda. Necessary information for this study came from a survey of 480 households across these regions. The results showed regional variations in the determinants of <b>woodlot</b> <b>farming,</b> demonstrating the importance of not extrapolating the results between regions. Pooled data across regions indicated that age of the householder, number of salaried household members, farm size, travel distance to fuelwood sources and household location in medium forest cover region had positive significant effects on the propensity to grow <b>farm</b> <b>woodlots.</b> In contrast, household location in low forest cover region, ownership of livestock and monthly frequency of purchasing fuelwood were inversely related to the presence of <b>farm</b> <b>woodlots.</b> Many households planted eucalyptus woodlots for economic reasons, not for environmental purposes. Livestock and crop production were more attractive to rural households than <b>woodlot</b> <b>farming.</b> The findings of the study can be used by policymakers and extension services in order to promote sustainable land use practices by focusing on the challenges of competing land uses, farm size, unemployment, dependence on forests for fuelwood supply and subsistence farming...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{estimates of}} short-run and long-run average costs of portable sawmills and discusses {{the implications of}} using portable rather than fixed-site sawmills for milling rainforest cabinet timbers in northern Queensland, Australia. Ten portable and eight fixed-site sawmills were surveyed in northern Queensland, and the findings, combined with information from other sources, were used to develop a financial model of milling costs. Financial analysis reveals that, because fixed costs for portable sawmills are low, the cost structure is dominated by variable costs, in particular labour costs. The rate of sawn timber recovery had a major effect on milling cost. The estimated short-run average total cost of milling rainforest timber with a portable sawmill was $ 162 m- 3 of roundlog ($ 361 m- 3 sawntimber), assuming a 45 % recovery rate and a roundlog throughput of 344 m 3 y- 1. This {{is higher than the}} median contract milling price of $ 140 m- 3 of roundlog ($ 311 m- 3 of sawntimber), suggesting that some portable sawmillers (especially part-time operators) do not take all costs into account. The financial model was also used to derive sawmilling long-run average cost curves, based on varying sizes of portable sawmills. The handsaw has the lowest milling cost for log throughput from zero to about 60 m 3 y- 1, the Lewis saw from 60 m 3 y- 1 to 185 m 3 y- 1, the Forestmill from 185 m 3 y- 1 to 1240 m 3 y- 1 and the Supermill beyond 1240 m 3 y- 1. The financial model developed indicates that even where all costs are included, portable sawmills can be competitive with fixed-site mills in an infant or declining industry situation, and can also play a role in <b>farm</b> <b>woodlot</b> forestry...|$|E

30|$|However, it will {{be equally}} {{important}} {{that some of the}} social challenges of plantation development be managed into the future, given previous community concerns over plantation expansion and related socio-economic and environmental impacts. The need for improved community engagement is considered important in gaining wider acceptance from stakeholders (Gordon et al. 2013). Plantation development can occur across a continuum of planting types from monocultures of exotic species to stands of mixed native species; and varying scales from broad scale plantations to small <b>farm</b> <b>woodlots</b> and riparian plantings. The majority of wood plantations in Australia and New Zealand have been large-scale and restricted to a select number of species for high productivity and commercial purposes. Community preferences for more diversified and small-scale plantings may entail changes in planting design and species mix which can have direct impacts on the costs to the forest owner. Managing plantations as part of whole farm plans may assist in this process, although would need to be weighed against the commercial costs and benefits such as higher transaction costs from more dispersed plantation areas.|$|R

40|$|In {{temperate}} agricultural watersheds, {{the rehabilitation}} of tree vegetation in degraded riparian zones can provide many ecosystem services. This study evaluated ecosystem service provision potential following the conversion of non-managed herbaceous buffers to hybrid poplar (Populus spp.) buffers in three watersheds (555 – 771 km 2) of southern Québec (Canada), with contrasting agricultural land uses. To extrapolate services at the watershed level, total stream length where hybrid poplars could be established was calculated using GIS data from hydrological and land cover maps. After nine years, a 100 % replacement of herbaceous buffers by hybrid poplar buffers along farm streams {{could lead to the}} production of 5280 – 76, 151 tons of whole tree (stems + branches) biomass, which could heat 0. 5 – 6. 5 ha of greenhouses for nine years, with the potential of displacing 2 – 29 million litres of fuel oil. Alternatively, the production of 3887 – 56, 135 tons of stem biomass (fuelwood) could heat 55 – 794 new farmhouses or 40 – 577 old farmhouses for nine years. Producing fuelwood in buffers rather than in <b>farm</b> <b>woodlots</b> could create forest conservation opportunities on 300 – 4553 ha.

The mill was started in 1902 and began operating under the name the Davison Lumber Company in 1903. They built numerous railway lines {{in the area to}} haul logs which were connected to the Halifax and South Western Railway running between Bridgewater and Middleton. One rail line connected with Lake Pleasant and to the remote mill area of Crossburn, and as far east as South river Lake near Lake George. evidence of the old rail lines can still be found today. In 1905, the company built 30 houses, a large three-story cookhouse, an office, and a school. In 1914, Hastings, (the mill site was named after owner John M. Hastings of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania) continued to boom with more houses, a warehouse, a store, a doctor's office, and a large clubhouse (which contained a bowling alley, two pool tables, a dressing room and a dance hall). The mill went bankrupt in the 1920s and a fire destroyed the mill in 1928. The fire consumed all the mill buildings and 35 of the remaining 55 houses.

40|$|Despite {{the image}} of {{buildings}} and petrified areas, a considerable part of urban and rural residential areas consists out of domestic gardens (Gaston et al., 2005), the nearest nature for many urban, semi-urban as well as rural dwellers. But how natural are these gardens? A large diversity by fragmentation in area {{as well as in}} property results in a large diversity in garden management. This management, in many cases under control of the garden owner, generates an intricate garden system with materials being brought in (inputs, like fertilizers and pesticides), materials being processed (stock, like green garden waste that is being composted) and materials being exported (outputs, like grass clippings). To what level are our gardens managed, what is the environmental impact and is it possible to monitor this? Gardens tend to be missing in land use, environmental as well as socio-economical statistics (Zmyslony and Gagnon, 1998). The research proposed here therefore collects new data on gardens. A garden is defined here as the part of the residential parcel without the associated house. Pasture for hobby <b>farming,</b> extensive <b>woodlots</b> and storage space for building materials or refuse are excluded from this definition. For Flanders, the northern part of Belgium, a regional-wide internet-survey has been conducted on garden components and management, including an inventory and quantification of inputs and outputs from the garden. Also data on socio-economical characteristics of the garden owner were collected. A number of 1. 138 respondents was considered for analysis, corresponding to 0, 13 % of the garden area in Flanders as determined by Dewaelheyns et al. (2008). For the quantification of inputs and outputs by means of an internet-survey, convenient metrics needed to be developed. A selection of survey results will be presented, including fertilizers, home compost and grass clippings. They support the idea that gardens in Flanders are a very dynamic type of land use, generating a number of material flows to and from the wider environment. Follow-up research will search for links between easily measurable characteristics of the garden (e. g. the percentage lawn within the garden area) or socio-economical characteristics of the garden owner (e. g. occupation and garden perception) with management characteristics (such as the use of fertilizers, pesticides or herbicides). It will be explored how useful existing links can be for a systematic environmental monitoring of gardens. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A little axe can {{cut down}} a big tree´ goes a well known Jamaican saying. It aptly {{describes}} the historical processes that have slowly eroded the island´s forest cover. Once called ´the land {{of wood and}} water´ by its original Taino inhabitants, Jamaica´s landscape underwent a massive change after the arrival of European settlers, who felled much of the forest for agricultural production. Even forest lands on hillsides and mountain slopes were cleared for growing crops. The forestry authorities are now grappling {{with the consequences of}} centuries of improper land use, including major environmental problems such as soil erosion, destruction of wildlife, and reduced river flows. Better land management is urgently needed to prevent further damage to the island´s forest resources. The Forestry Department of the Ministry of Agriculture has recognized that, in order to raise awareness of the need for sustainable forest management, it will have to fight the battle on two fronts - within the government and among ordinary Jamaicans, farmers in particular. Thus, the Trees for Tomorrow (TFT) project was launched which is turning foresters into geographic information system (GIS) experts and video camera-wielding extension officers. The TFT project, sponsored by the Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA) and the government of Jamaica, is the Forestry Department´s most important effort to win {{the hearts and minds of}} Jamaicans. Initiated in 1992, one of its main concerns is to gather accurate and reliable data on the extent of forest cover and the exact location of forest boundaries, and how these have changed over time, in order to support national and local forestry plans. One of the project´s major achievements has been the creation of a GIS database that includes an inventory of forest lands and aerial photographs of the entire island. With this database, Forestry Department members can analyze land use patterns and identify areas that are under serious environmental threat. These areas may then be nominated for inclusion on the list of protected national reserves. The GIS also contains survey data on existing forest reserve boundaries, and the extent of encroachment, recorded by staff using Global Positioning System (GPS) devices. The TFT members´ surveying efforts have proven remarkably effective. Based on their GIS analyses the government strengthened its commitment to keep aside a significant proportion of the island as forest reserves. The island´s forest reserves occupy more than 111, 000 hectares, or over 10 % of the area of the island. Using TFT survey data, the Forestry Department is in the process of establishing a detailed forest protection system and a plan for patrolling these reserves. Forest Awareness Campaign Another component of the TFT project is the Forest Awareness Campaign, which was launched in 1998. The campaign aims to gain public support for the sustainable management of forests and watersheds, through exhibitions, information centres at agricultural shows, a website and educational broadcasts on national TV. As part of this initiative, the Department´s foresters and wardens have received training in a variety of extension techniques. Equipped with video cameras, overhead projectors and an array of informative posters, calendars and brochures, they now give talks at community meetings and organize training and work days for farmers. During these events, they provide farmers with free tree seedlings and technical advice on, for example, <b>farm</b> <b>woodlots,</b> agroforestry systems and soil conservation. A parallel schools programme aims at delivering forest protection and management messages to children of all ages. Their talks are enlivened by a series of educational videos. One example is the ´Forest Watch´ series, which features, in a news programme format, interviews with ´forest heroes´ - ordinary people who are doing a good job in the forestry sector. So far, these heroes have included a hill farmer who discusses soil conservation; the coordinator of an NGO who is developing a bamboo craft centre; and a landowner who has set aside part of his land as a sustainable pine plantation. The interest of local communities in the Forest Awareness Campaign´s agenda has led to the formation of three local forest management committees which provide the Forestry Department with feedback on its management of the forest reserves. Another measure of the success of the public awareness programme has been the positive response of the private sector to the Forestry Department´s appeal to join in the effort to restore and protect the island´s forests. The Trees for Tomorrow project has made a significant contribution to sustainable forest management in Jamaica. It has also helped the Forestry Department to improve its performance, capacity and credibility. Its innovative application of ICTs and environmental awareness raising techniques will benefit the country for years to come. mailto:slatham@forestry. gov. jm Susie Latham is an agriculture economist and TFT project member.

The most prominent landmark on the wartime landscape was the residence of tenant farmer John Brawner and his family. The present structure, which was likely built or added to after the Civil War, now occupies part of the site overlooking the Warrenton Turnpike (present day U. S. Route 29). The two-story structure is currently unoccupied and in poor condition. None of the farmstead’s ancillary structures remain, but archeological traces dot the grounds. Across much of the farm, evidence of historic field patterns remains, with cedar rows denoting the location of fence lines. A mixed pine and hardwood forest covers most of the once-cleared fields in the eastern portion of the <b>farm.</b> The historic <b>woodlot,</b> known variously as Brawner Woods or Gibbon’s Woods, nevertheless is a discernible hardwood stand in the southeastern corner of the farm adjacent to U. S. Route 29. The location of the wartime orchard, however, is unknown, although remnants of two later orchards exist northeast and east of the house. An unimproved driveway currently provides access to the farmstead from U. S. Route 29, while the historic farm trace runs parallel to and east of the modern access road. In a valley west of the farmstead lie the headwaters of Youngs Branch. Beyond the stream the ground rises to a clear ridge, where Confederate artillery and infantry advanced during the August 28 battle in a successful effort to force the Federals to withdraw. Northeast of the farmstead, rising ground forms a spur of Stony Ridge that served as the position of S. D. Lee's Confederate artillery on August 30. Five Civil War-era cannon, spread across the ridge crest, mark the artillery battalion’s position and serve as an interpretive aid.
