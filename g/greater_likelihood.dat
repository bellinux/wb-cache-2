5|$|Liver {{dysfunction}} as {{a result}} of malaria is uncommon and usually only occurs in those with another liver condition such as viral hepatitis or chronic liver disease. The syndrome is sometimes called malarial hepatitis. While it has been considered a rare occurrence, malarial hepatopathy has seen an increase, particularly in Southeast Asia and India. Liver compromise in people with malaria correlates with a <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> of complications and death.|$|E
5|$|When {{there is}} more pollen applied to the stigma, more seeds are {{produced}} in the fruits and the fruits are larger with <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> of maturation, an effect called xenia. Competitively grown specimens are therefore often hand-pollinated to maximize the number of seeds in the fruit, which increases the fruit size; this pollination requires skilled technique. Seedlessness is known to occur in certain cultivars of C.pepo.|$|E
5|$|White tigers {{are more}} {{frequently}} bred in captivity, where the comparatively small gene pool {{can lead to}} inbreeding. This has given white tigers a <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> of being born with physical defects, such as cleft palate, scoliosis (curvature of the spine), and strabismus (squint). Even apparently healthy white tigers generally do not live {{as long as their}} orange counterparts. Attempts have been made to cross white and orange tigers to remedy this, often mixing with other subspecies in the process.|$|E

5|$|An injury {{at a lower}} {{point on}} the spine does not {{necessarily}} mean better sexual function; for example, people with injuries in the sacral region {{are less likely to be}} able to orgasm than those with injuries higher on the spine. Women with injuries above the sacral level have a <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> of orgasm in response to stimulation of the clitoris than those with sacral injuries (59% vs 17%). In men, injuries above the sacral level are associated with better function in terms of erections and ejaculation, and fewer and less severe reports of dysfunction. This may be due to reflexes that do not require input from the brain, which sacral injuries might interrupt.|$|E
5|$|Despite its {{relative}} brightness (it {{is about a}} fifth as bright as Pluto), Makemake was not discovered until after many much fainter Kuiper belt objects. Most searches for minor planets are conducted relatively close to the ecliptic (the region of the sky that the Sun, Moon and planets appear to lie in, as seen from Earth), due to the <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> of finding objects there. It probably escaped detection during the earlier surveys due to {{its relative}}ly high orbital inclination, {{and the fact that}} it was at its farthest distance from the ecliptic at the time of its discovery, in the northern constellation of Coma Berenices.|$|E
5|$|Urinary tract {{infections are}} more {{concerning}} in pregnancy {{due to the}} increased risk of kidney infections. During pregnancy, high progesterone levels elevate the risk of decreased muscle tone of the ureters and bladder, {{which leads to a}} <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> of reflux, where urine flows back up the ureters and towards the kidneys. While pregnant women do not have an increased risk of asymptomatic bacteriuria, if bacteriuria is present they do have a 25–40% risk of a kidney infection. Thus if urine testing shows signs of an infection—even in the absence of symptoms—treatment is recommended. Cephalexin or nitrofurantoin are typically used because they are generally considered safe in pregnancy. A kidney infection during pregnancy may result in premature birth or pre-eclampsia (a state of high blood pressure and kidney dysfunction during pregnancy that can lead to seizures). Some women have UTIs that keep coming back in pregnancy and currently there is not enough research on how to best treat these infections.|$|E

25|$|When {{the damage}} occurs {{in any area}} of changed cells, {{something}} different occurs. Each of the cells {{has the potential for}} growth. The changed cells will divide quicker when the area is damaged by physical, chemical, or viral agents. A vicious circle has been set up: Damaging the area will cause the changed cells to divide, causing a <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> that they will suffer knock-outs.|$|E
25|$|Seismic {{activity}} (earthquakes and tremors) always {{occurs as}} volcanoes awaken {{and prepare to}} erupt and are a very important link to eruptions. Some volcanoes normally have continuing low-level seismic activity, but an increase may signal a <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> of an eruption. The types of earthquakes that occur and where they start and end are also key signs. Volcanic seismicity has three major forms: short-period earthquake, long-period earthquake, and harmonic tremor.|$|E
25|$|Almost 90% of {{maternal}} deaths during childbirth occur in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, compared {{to less than}} 1% in the developed world. Those who live in poverty have {{also been shown to}} have a far <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> of having or incurring a disability within their lifetime. Infectious diseases such as malaria and tuberculosis can perpetuate poverty by diverting health and economic resources from investment and productivity; malaria decreases GDP growth by up to 1.3% in some developing nations and AIDS decreases African growth by 0.3–1.5% annually.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the main}} reasons people avoid visiting the dentist is dental anxiety. Dental anxiety drives some people to create more dental {{problems}} by not visiting the dentist on a regular basis. Patients who are high in dental anxiety have the <b>greatest</b> <b>likelihood</b> of avoiding dental treatment. An estimated nine percent to fifteen percent of the American population—about 30 million to 40 million people—avoid essential dental care because of fear or anxiety.|$|R

Numerous changes {{were made to the}} study in order to achieve a <b>great</b> <b>likelihood</b> of success and new top-line data from this study in November 2016. However, the study reported in November 2016 that the drug failed to demonstrate efficacy.|$|R
25|$|To {{achieve this}} assault, {{two things are}} {{necessary}} – a number of hard-hitting batsmen yet to bat or not out {{and a number of}} wickets in hand (since aggression means a <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> of losing wickets). The last 10 overs of a one-day cricket match innings is often the most exciting part of the innings, because of the large number of boundaries scored and wickets taken. During the last ten overs of an ODI, batsmen often use shots that are riskier than shots played {{at the beginning of the}} innings.|$|E
25|$|On further reflection, the Meditator {{realizes that}} even simple {{things can be}} doubted. Omnipotent God could make even our {{conception}} of mathematics false. One might argue that God is supremely good and would not lead him to believe falsely all these things. But by this reasoning we should think that God would not deceive him with regard to anything, and yet this is clearly not true. If we suppose there is no God, then there is even <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> of being deceived, since our imperfect senses {{would not have been}} created by a perfect being.|$|E
25|$|Irmenach’s and Beuren’s {{beginnings}} are {{shrouded in}} darkness. There {{are known to}} have been settlers in the area as early as Roman times. An old local tradition has it that the name Irmenach goes back to Saint Irmina, which is, however, hardly likely. A far <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> is that it came from Herminiachus (“Herminius’s Estate”), in which Herminius was a Celtic nobleman who had Latinized his name. Originally, Irmenach formed, together with Beuren and Thalkleinich, now an outlying centre of Kleinich, the greater municipality of Irmenach, which existed until 1828.|$|E

25|$|Although mice {{are small}} animals and {{care must be}} taken to avoid injury, they are also {{surprisingly}} robust and inquisitive. Once out of the cage many enjoy running along their owners' arms, investigating pockets, or just sitting on the owner's lap and grooming. Some mice also tolerate gentle petting. Care must be taken as mice have poor eyesight and may try to lean too far over an edge and fall. Care must especially be taken when being handled by small children as they may be overly rough. Fancy mice very rarely bite except when hurt or very frightened. Biting behavior may result from improper handling, as mice are generally considered non-aggressive. They do have a <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> of biting unfamiliar people, especially males who are wild and territorial.|$|E
25|$|Laboratory {{evidence}} of increased inflammation combined with demographic features (male sex, age {{less than six}} months or greater than eight years) and incomplete response to IVIG therapy create a profile of a high-risk patient with Kawasaki disease. The likelihood that an aneurysm will resolve appears to be determined in large measure by its initial size, in which the smaller aneurysms have a <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> of regression. Other factors are positively associated with the regression of aneurysms, including being younger than a year old at the onset of Kawasaki disease, fusiform rather than saccular aneurysm morphology, and an aneurysm location in a distal coronary segment. The highest rate of progression to stenosis occurs among those who develop large aneurysms. The worst prognosis occurs in children with giant aneurysms. This severe outcome may require further treatment such as percutaneous transluminal angioplasty, coronary artery stenting, bypass grafting, and even cardiac transplantation.|$|E
25|$|Smoking {{has also}} {{been linked to the}} {{development}} of cervical cancer. Smoking can increase the risk in women a few different ways, which can be by direct and indirect methods of inducing cervical cancer. A direct way of contracting this cancer is a smoker has a higher chance of CIN3 occurring which has the potential of forming cervical cancer. When CIN3 lesions lead to cancer, most of them have the assistance of the HPV virus, but that is not always the case, which is why it can be considered a direct link to cervical cancer. Heavy smoking and long-term smoking seem to have more of a risk of getting the CIN3 lesions than lighter smoking or not smoking at all. Although smoking has been linked to cervical cancer, it aids in the development of HPV which {{is the leading cause of}} this type of cancer. Also, not only does it aid in the development of HPV, but also if the woman is already HPV-positive, she is at an even <b>greater</b> <b>likelihood</b> of contracting cervical cancer.|$|E
40|$|We {{suggest that}} {{interactions}} with strangers at work influence {{the likelihood of}} depressive disorders, as they serve as an environmental stressor, which are {{a necessary condition for}} the onset of depression according to diathesis-stress models of depression. We examined a large dataset (N =  76, 563 in K =  196 occupations) from the German pension insurance program and the Occupational Information Network dataset on occupational characteristics. We used a multilevel framework with individuals and occupations as levels of analysis. We found that occupational environments influence employees' risks of depression. In line with the quotation that 'hell is other people' frequent conflictual contacts were related to <b>greater</b> <b>likelihoods</b> of depression in both males and females (OR =  1. 14, p<. 05). However, interactions with the public were related to <b>greater</b> <b>likelihoods</b> of depression for males but lower likelihoods of depression for females (ORintercation =  1. 21, p<. 01). We theorize that some occupations may involve interpersonal experiences with negative emotional tones that make functional coping difficult and increase the risk of depression. In other occupations, these experiences have neutral tones and allow for functional coping strategies. Functional strategies are more often found in women than in men...|$|R
