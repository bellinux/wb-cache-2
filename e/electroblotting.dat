40|$|AbstractWe {{demonstrate}} that {{human immunodeficiency virus}} HIV- 1 LAI envelope glycoprotein 120 (gp 120 LAi) specifically interacts with several membrane ligands on lymphoid CEM or monocytic U 937 cells {{in addition to its}} previously identified receptor, CD 4, and CXCR 4, its coreceptor. In its native state, gp 120 LAI is able to elicit specific multimolecular complexes with these membrane ligands at the surface of the cells; most of the interactions are abolished by mannan or heparin but not by dextran. Similarly, stromal cell-derived factor (SDF) - 1 α interacts not only with CXCR 4 expressed by CXCR 4 + CD 4 + U 937, CEM, and HOS-CD 4 + CXCR 4 + cells but also with CD 4 expressed by intact U 937, CEM, and HOS-CD 4 + CXCR 4 +/− cells or <b>electroblotted</b> onto Immobilon. SDF- 1 α binding to CD 4 + CXCR 4 +/− cells, or soluble CD 4 <b>electroblotted</b> onto Immobilon, is significantly inhibited by sCD 4, whereas truncated sCD 4 lacking D 3 and D 4 domains had no significant effect, which indicates that SDF- 1 binds to CD 4 but at regions different from the HIV-gp 120 -binding site.

40|$|A rapid {{method for}} the {{identification}} of known proteins separated by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is described in which molecular masses of peptide fragments are used to search a protein sequence database.

40|$|AbstractElectrospray {{ionization}} {{mass spectrometry}} (ESI/MS) affords a rapid and sensitive technique for determining peptides {{produced by the}} enzymatic digestion of phosphoproteins. When coupled with on-line immobilized metal-ion affinity chromatography (IMAC), the combination allows separation and mass spectrometric identification of phosphorylated and nonphosphorylated peptides. In this study, the feasibility and general applicability of on-line IMAC/ESI/MS is investigated by using immobilized ferric ions for selective chelation of several phosphotyrosine and phosphoserine peptides. The sensitivity and practicality of the technique for phosphoproteins are demonstrated via the analysis of 30 pmol (∼ 0. 7 μg) of bovine β-casein purified by sodium dodecylsulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, <b>electroblotted</b> onto a polyvinylidene difluoride membrane, and digested in situ with trypsin. It is observed that on-line IMAC/ESI/MS suffers less from sample losses than experiments performed off-line, suggesting that the limiting factors in sensitivity for this technique are the purification procedures and sample handling rather than the IMAC and mass spectrometry. Thus, the ability to inject the tryptic digest of an <b>electroblotted</b> protein directly onto the column without buffer exchange and to analyze the eluent directly via on-line coupling of the IMAC column to the mass spectrometer greatly reduces sample losses incurred through sample handling and provides a convenient method for analyzing phosphopeptides at low levels...|$|R

We have developed simple chemical protocols where proteins are first <b>electroblotted</b> onto unmodified PVDF membranes, visualized with common protein stains, and then immobilized for solid-phase sequence analysis. Adsorbed, stained proteins are first treated with phenylisothiocyanate (PITC) to modify alpha and epsilon amines. The protein is then overlayed with a solution of 1, 4 -phenylene di-isothiocyanate (DITC), followed by a few microliters of a basic solution containing a poly(alkylamine).
