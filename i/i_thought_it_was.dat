5|$|Reflecting on his {{stint in}} first season of Indian Super League, Chopra {{admitted}} that ISL {{turned out to}} be much more intense and competitive than he had anticipated. He said“I think there were a few things that went wrong; I underestimated the ISL. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be easier than it was, and then I picked up a hamstring injury in pre-season which set me back.|$|E
5|$|My first {{memory of}} {{fragrance}} is my mother, {{and as a}} very young girl, hearing her footsteps... Her stilettos click, click, clicking on the hardwood floor and she wore a beautiful fragrance and she would walk past me and it would just stay in the room. It left a warm feeling every time I thought about her scent. I think about the icons that I respect {{and they all have}} their own fragrance so <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> time for me to have my own.|$|E
5|$|That {{shot was}} totally and {{completely}} inspired by 'Something's Got to Give,' Marilyn Monroe's last movie that never got finished. It's {{an homage to}} her, because I've never seen anyone re-create it. So many people have emulated so many of Marilyn's classic moments, but it's just that I'm {{a big fan of}} hers, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> really pretty at night with the pool. No one could ever be as fabulous as Marilyn was, but it's in honor and homage to her.|$|E

"Dr. Grantly {{asked me}} whether <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> prudent {{for him to}} receive you in his house as the wife of Mr. Slope, and I told him that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> would <b>be</b> imprudent.

5|$|Darla {{appears in}} twenty Angel episodes, mainly as an evil antagonist. The {{character}} {{is known for}} dying {{the most in the}} Buffy The Vampire Slayer franchise. Benz later emphasized: I just didn't know how it was going to happen. So when they sent me the script —which I basically had to sign my life away to read—I was sitting in my trailer and I just started to cry. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> such a beautiful ending, it was the payoff and just really brought her whole life kind of to that one moment. So I was really upset my last day of filming because I really thought it was over to me.|$|E

25|$|I was {{comfortable}} with them pursuing their original vision. And {{it was a}} very reasonable valuation. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be a pretty safe investment.|$|E

60|$|I {{expected}} {{few things}} {{less than a}} journey at that time, but I <b>was</b> ready for <b>it</b> {{in half an hour}} and set off as appointed early next morning. I travelled all day, wondering all day what I could be wanted for at such a distance; now <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> might <b>be</b> for this purpose, and now <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> might <b>be</b> for that purpose, but I was never, never, never near the truth.|$|R
25|$|Based on {{something}} a (now ex) girlfriend said to me. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a negative picture, but then I realised it was positive because it’s a reconciliation after self-knowledge. It’s also ambiguous as to who’s speaking. Most {{of my paintings}} are based on experiences with people I know, usually on a drawing from life, {{but in this case}} from a photo I took of her.|$|E
25|$|Brown is {{the author}} of <b>I</b> <b>Thought</b> <b>It</b> <b>Was</b> Just Me (but it isn't): Telling the Truth About Perfectionism, Inadequacy, and Power (Penguin/Gotham, 2007), The Gifts of Imperfection: Letting Go of Who We Think We Should Be and Embracing Who We Are (Hazelden, 2010), Daring Greatly: How the Courage to Be Vulnerable Transforms the Way We Live, Love, Parent, and Lead (Gotham, 2012), Rising Strong: The Reckoning.

25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics {{in the press and}} Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think I hurt Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

25|$|We {{all knew}} {{in our hearts}} that Michael was disappointing. We felt that we had {{compensated}} adequately in making a fun, exciting, stylized world. You know, I was disappointed in one aspect: a voiceover from Tom’s sister that we had, which Walter later decided to cut. Um, {{there were a couple}} of things in the narrative that I felt went out that probably should have stayed in. At the same time, I was myself knocked out by what Walter and (cinematographer) Andy Laszlo and our editor were doing visually on the film. And I felt, as I watched the post-production process going on, I just saw the film getting better and better. More impressive. To the point where <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to do well. And I thought that we had done what we set out to do. Created the world that we set out to create.... It was a movie that was built to succeed. It’s funny. The movie screened very, very well. I remember, after the first screenings, people told me that I was going to be rich for life. There was tremendous love and confidence.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon I suffered such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

There {{might have been}} a few things that I would have done differently, but that's not the point—you could say that about any movie." ...|$|E

6000|$|MONDAY.--I believe I {{see what}} the week <b>is</b> for: <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to give time to rest up from the weariness of Sunday. It seems a good idea. ... She has been {{climbing}} that tree again. Clodded her out of it. She said nobody was looking. Seems to consider that a sufficient justification for chancing any dangerous thing. Told her that. The word justification moved her admiration--and envy, too, <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>It</b> <b>is</b> a good word.|$|R
500|$|The reason I {{added the}} piccolo trumpet and {{classical}} {{section in the}} middle of Let's All Chant' was mainly because I was embarrassed! <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so stupid with that 'Ooh-ah' sound in it that I wanted to add something to lift the track musically. I have a classical background and went to a music conservatory, so I was really feeling embarrassed ...|$|E
500|$|... just {{fit right}} in with my own {{personal}} zeitgeist of standing up to male authorities, whether it's the pope, or the Catholic Church or {{my father and his}} conservative, patriarchal ways.... For 'Papa Don't Preach' there were so many opinions– that's why <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> so great. Is she for 'schma-smortion', as they say in Knocked Up? Is she against abortion? ...|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with the Windy City Media Group, Stefani said [...] " [...] was so perfect for my story-for what I was feeling in my own personal life-that I didn't even get it as a feminist anthem. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just about me!

And, to me, {{it turned out to}} be a country song, when we got our instrumentation on it and everything. And some people go, 'Well, why in the world would you do a pop song?' I just think music is music. You've got good and you've got bad, and I try to stay on the good side." ...|$|E
500|$|This {{species is}} often listed in field guides as inedible, or not {{recommended}} for consumption due to its tough texture. Michael Kuo, in his 2007 book on edible mushrooms, lists the taste as [...] "mediocre", and comments [...] "the devil's urn is {{not as bad as}} <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be.

500|$|... "Bobby Bonilla and Rafael Palmeiro {{pushed me}} out of the dugout and said, 'Hey, if you don't do a lap around this thing, we'll never get the game started.' <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a ridiculous sort of thing... but as I started to do it, the celebration of 50,000 started to be very {{one-on-one}} and very personal. I started seeing people I knew... Those were the people that had been around the ballpark all those years, and it was really a wonderful human experience." ...|$|E
