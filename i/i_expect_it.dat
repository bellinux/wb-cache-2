500|$|While {{agency is}} the first of two {{dimensions}} of Dyer's story, the second is allegiance. [...] Dyer became a known in the public eye on the day when Anne Hutchinson was excommunicated, and Dyer took her hand while they walked out of the meeting house together. [...] Dyer had a strong affiliation and allegiance to this older woman who shared the secret of her unfortunate birth. [...] Likewise, two decades later she framed her acts as a means to stand by her friends and share in their fate. [...] In the first of two letters of Dyer's that have been preserved, she wrote to the General Court, [...] "if my Life were freely granted by you, it would not avail me, nor could <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> of you, so long as I should daily hear or see the Sufferings of these People, my dear Brethren and Seed, with whom my Life is bound up, as I have done these two years". [...] Traditional bonds for females were to spouses and children, yet in the Quaker community there were strong spiritual bonds that transcended gender boundaries. [...] Thus the Puritan public found it very unusual that Dyer walked to the gallows hand-in-hand between two male friends, and she was asked if she was not ashamed of doing so. [...] This spiritual closeness of the Quakers was very threatening to the Puritan mindset where allegiance was controlled by the male church members. [...] The Quakers allowed their personal bonds to transgress not only gender lines, but also the boundaries of age and class.|$|E
2500|$|One {{of the few}} {{accounts}} of the Spix in captivity was given by Rev. F.G. Dutton, president of the Avicultural Society U.K. in 1900: [...] "I have not yet seen a good-tempered Spix... My Spix, which is really more a Conure than a Macaw, will not look at sop of any sort, except sponge cake given from one's fingers, only drinks plain water, and lives mainly on sunflower seed. It has hemp, millet, and canary, and peanuts, but I {{do not think it}} eats much of any of them. It barks the branches of the tree in which it is loose, and may eat the bark. It would very likely be all the better if it would eat bread and milk, as it might then produce some flight feathers, which it never yet has had. But <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> would not eat any sop, even if I gave it nothing else." ...|$|E
2500|$|Coach Gregg Popovich of the San Antonio Spurs {{used the}} Hack-a-Shaq {{strategy}} successfully in Game 5 of the Spurs' 2008 first round series against O'Neal and the Phoenix Suns. O'Neal scored only 9 of his 20 free throws, dropping the Suns to 20-of-37 total on free throws." [...] The Suns were {{eliminated from the}} playoffs in a 92–87 Spurs win. In May 2008, ESPN.com columnist John Hollinger named the Spurs Hack-a-Shaq use as the [...] "Best Tactic" [...] {{of the first two}} rounds of the 2008 NBA Playoffs. [...] Hollinger wrote that Popovich was the [...] "first to really master how to use this weapon to his advantage." [...] He explained that Popovich used the tactic [...] "to eliminate 3-point attempts" [...] and with 25 seconds or less at the end of quarters to get the ball back for the Spurs to gain the last possession. [...] Hollinger stated [...] "This should be a Eureka! moment for other coaches, and <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> will be the league's most widely copied tactic next year." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> {{to swear}} at me, {{but it seemed}} too broken-spirited to mind anything.|$|R
60|$|It {{was not for}} me {{to dispute}} what he said. I merely shrugged my shoulders. Yet, as a matter of fact, <b>I</b> was <b>expecting</b> every moment to find the hand of a gendarme upon my shoulder. <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> as the {{carriage}} stopped before the restaurant and we crossed the pavement. <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> even when two men who were sitting in the anteroom of the restaurant rose up to meet us. Louis, standing between, performed an introduction.|$|R
60|$|Aur. There 'tis; farewell, cavalier, {{keep your}} promise, for <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> furiously.|$|E
6000|$|... [To MRS. APPLEBY.] My {{brother is}} one of Sir Arthur's secretaries. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> was he that Mr. Appleby left with Sir Arthur.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then she'd have {{to support}} me. Besides, <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> {{would be hard to}} find a rich girl willing to marry a poor engineer." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dunno," [...] said Asaph, as {{carelessly}} as {{he could}} speak. [...] "I don't meddle with household matters of that kind. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it's</b> somethin' the matter with that gal Betsey, that Marietta hires to help her. She's always wrong some way or other so that she can't do her own proper work, which I know, havin' {{to do a good}} deal of <b>it</b> myself. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it's</b> rickets, like as not. Gals do have that sort of thing, don't they?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, and I'm {{not afraid}} of it. It's mighty! It is grander than <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> to be--grand and terrible, but it's where things are done." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well," [...] said Carrie, [...] "I suppose I'm not romantic. Unless you're romantic in {{the right}} way, you're ridiculous. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it's</b> easier to be useful." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh, no,' {{answered}} Ingiborg, 'he {{is enjoying}} himself {{out there in}} the forest. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> will be quite dark before he comes back again.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Just so," [...] Foster answered, smiling. [...] "He imagines it {{will turn}} out profitable, but <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> will take up much of his time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know this}} place," [...] said Uncle Beamish, {{as we stood}} by the kitchen stove, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> belongs to a widow woman." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{story was}} a much longer one than <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> to be, and John must have driven those horses {{backward}} and forward for half an hour.|$|R
6000|$|... "In trouble?" [...] Scopus {{asked as}} they left the house. [...] "Ay, lad, <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>it,</b> and knew that sooner or later it would come. What is it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle," [...] I returned, [...] "I didn't {{expect you}} to be so angry as this." [...] Nor had <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>it,</b> {{though he was a}} hard and angry old man.|$|R
6000|$|... “Most annoying,” {{agreed the}} banker’s wife, sympathetically; “it is the intense cold, <b>I</b> <b>expect,</b> <b>it</b> breaks {{the old people}} up. It has been unusually cold this year.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{all goes}} as <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it,</b> six months. If not, I {{may be a}} year, or longer. I shall {{certainly}} not come back until I am successful." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{often hear}} them speak among themselves," [...] I said, [...] "about {{somebody}} called Maloka. I wonder who on earth this Maloka is? <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it's</b> Maloka she's going to marry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was with}} him for a year or two," [...] Ellams answered, in a {{reminiscent}} tone. [...] "A strange man, in some ways! <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it's</b> long since you saw him?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Hullo! what's that?" [...] Bill exclaimed at last. [...] "That's {{the rattle}} of a chain. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it's</b> a barge {{anchoring}} somewhere near. Listen; I can hear voices. I vote we hollo." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{has done}} too much," [...] Mabel agreed. [...] "Bob tells me {{things are going}} remarkably well for Wyndhams'. All the same, <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> has cost Harry some effort." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Spencer," [...] he said, [...] "I am almost blind, and I cannot {{see your}} face, but I {{want you to}} tell me the truth. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> from you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "People {{always say}} that--and {{we know very}} well women {{scarcely}} ever jilt men; 'tis the men who jilt us. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> is simply his nature to be so reserved." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a plucky girl," [...] said Chisholm. [...] "Still <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it's</b> better he {{has come}} back rich. After all, romance wears off, and then, if money's short, the strain begins." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "To {{tell you}} the truth, Dorothy, I don't {{think you ought to}} have been {{receiving}} love-letters from Brooke Burgess when I was lying ill in bed. <b>I</b> didn't <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> of you. <b>I</b> tell you fairly that <b>I</b> didn't <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> of you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, it {{is quite}} a large place!" [...] Wilfrid exclaimed in surprise. [...] "Different, of course, from towns at home, with more open spaces. <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>it</b> would be much rougher than it is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know if that}} {{is strange}} or not, but perhaps you had better read it. <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> will clear the ground for me and I have {{something}} to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, lots o' people do. But if he isn't mad he'll be sorry, and that'll be even worse, for a Presbyterian I'm {{bound to}} be. But <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> will make things unpleasant." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{going to}} the Holy Land only {{to look for it}} would be much the same thing," [...] said Armine. [...] "Besides, <b>I</b> <b>expect</b> <b>it</b> is up among the Druses, where one can't go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The work is {{just what}} I should have chosen, your Grace," [...] I answered. [...] "I like hard work, and <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>it.</b> The trouble is that I have succeeded no better than Lord Ronald." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may," [...] she answered. [...] "In fact, <b>I</b> <b>expected</b> <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> am {{not sure}} that I did not ask for it. And that reminds me. I want you to do me a favour, if you will." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I knew it, my dear--at least I {{felt sure}} {{it would come to}} this, though it is sooner than <b>I</b> <b>expected.</b> <b>It</b> is not written anywhere, I believe, that a boy may not marry a baby, nevertheless--" ...|$|R
