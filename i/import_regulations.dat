25|$|Commercial bonsai growers may {{use any of}} {{the other}} means of obtaining starter bonsai material, from seed {{propagation}} to collecting expeditions, but they generally sell mature specimens that display bonsai aesthetic qualities already. The grower trains the source specimens {{to a greater or lesser}} extent before sale, and the trees may be ready for display as soon as they are bought. Those who purchase commercially grown bonsai face some challenges, however, particularly of buying from another country. If the purchaser's local climate does not closely match the climate in which the bonsai was created, the plant will have difficulties surviving and thriving. As well, importing living plant material from a foreign source is often closely controlled by <b>import</b> <b>regulations</b> and may require a license or other special import arrangement on the buyer's part. If a local commercial bonsai grower does not exist, buying from a distant one may be unsatisfactory.|$|E

25|$|The entire period saw mercantilism as {{the basis}} for commerce, which {{involved}} <b>import</b> <b>regulations</b> and tariffs, monopolies and privileges throughout the county granted to burghers. The lumber industry became important in the 17th century through exports especially to England. To avoid deforestation, a royal decree closed a large number of sawmills in 1688; because this mostly affected farmers with small mills, by the mid 18th century only a handful of merchants controlled the entire lumber industry. Mining increased in the 17th century, the largest being the silver mines in Kongsberg and the copper mines in Røros. Fishing continued to be an important income for farmers along the coast, but from the 18th century dried cod started being salted, which required fishermen to buy salt from merchants. The first important period of Norwegian shipping was between 1690 and 1710, but the advantage was lost with Denmark–Norway entering the Great Northern War in 1709. However, Norwegian shipping regained its strength {{towards the end of the}} century.|$|E
2500|$|The Fourth Labour {{government}}, {{elected in}} July 1984, {{moved away from}} government intervention {{in the economy and}} allowed free market mechanisms to dominate. These reforms became known as [...] "Rogernomics", named after Minister of Finance from 1984-1988, Roger Douglas. The changes included making the Reserve Bank independent of political decisions; performance contracts for senior civil servants; public sector finance reform based on accrual accounting; tax neutrality; subsidy-free agriculture; and industry-neutral competition regulation. [...] Government subsidies including agricultural subsidies were eliminated; <b>import</b> <b>regulations</b> were loosened up; the exchange rate was floated; and controls on interest rates, wages, and prices were removed; and personal rates of taxation were reduced. Tight monetary policy and major efforts to reduce the government budget deficit brought the inflation rate down from an annual rate of more than 18% in 1987. The deregulation of government-owned enterprises in the 1980s and 1990s reduced government's role in the economy and permitted the retirement of some public debt.|$|E

The supply side of the open economy model developed by Buffle (1986) is modified {{to take into account}} the import dependency of the region. In the first regime, with endogenous foreign savings, overvalued exchange rate and expansionary monetary policy tend to increase the current account deficit. In the second regime, when intermediate imports are rationed to handle the foreign exchange shortage, overvaluation and monetary expansion are shown to be likely sources of output contraction. The cost of policy reorientation is reduced investment. Copyright Kluwer Academic Publishers 1994 Devaluation, monetary policy, <b>import</b> <b>regulation,</b> foreign exchange constraint,...|$|R
