30|$|For the {{measurement}} of the wall thickness of pipes, another analytical method relying {{on the use of}} inverse Laplace transform has been developed in Ref. [42]. The model is, unlike most reported analytical models, non-axisymmetric and it presents a good correlation with measured data. Rather than having an <b>encircling</b> <b>coil,</b> the excitation coil is perpendicular {{to the surface of the}} pipe. For complex cases, numerical algorithms like Stehfest and Fast Fourier transform have been proposed to do the inversion of Laplace transform, because analytical inversion of Laplace transform is inaccessible [43]. Chen et al also proposed new signal features that can be used for determining the sample plate’s magnetic permeability and electrical conductivity assuming that the thickness is previously determined by means of their analytical model [44].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A popular {{approach}} of eddy current testing (ECT) modelling is the volume integral method (VIM) {{which leads to}} fast and accurate calculations for canonical geometries. Models developed at CEA using this approach are integrated into the CIVA platform dedicated to non destructive testing (NDT). New configurations have been modelled for the simulation of eddy current inspection of tubes affected by a 3 D flaw. Probes concerned here are a set of <b>encircling</b> <b>coils</b> that may be off-centre or tilted {{with respect to the}} tube axis and sectorial probes dedicated to eddy current testing of welding seam areas.

40|$|<b>Encircling</b> <b>coil</b> {{eddy current}} testing of thin walled small {{diameter}} tube is inspected as it travels through a coil excited {{with one or}} more high frequency signals. The composition of the material under test influences the selection of the test frequency. Usually these materials have very low conductivity and small dimensions that require a high test frequency. In the past, these materials were tested at a maximum of 1 MHZ due to coil design and limitations to the input stages of electronics. With new electronics which are linear and coil designs which are low impedance, it is possible to test these materials with greater S/N (signal to noise) and use the phase response to reject mechanical, permeability and dielectric noise. This paper will discuss the advantages obtained by testing these types of materials at higher frequencies using new coils designs.

50|$|Pulsed {{inductive}} thrusters (PIT) use pulses {{instead of}} continuous thrust {{and have the}} ability to run on power levels on the order of megawatts (MW). PITs consist of a large <b>coil</b> <b>encircling</b> a cone shaped tube that emits the propellant gas. Ammonia is the gas commonly used. For each pulse, a large charge builds up in a group of capacitors behind the coil and is then released. This creates a current that moves circularly in the direction of jθ. The current then creates a magnetic field in the outward radial direction (Br), which then creates a current in the gas that has just been released in the opposite direction of the original current. This opposite current ionizes the ammonia. The positively charged ions are accelerated away from the engine due to the electric field jθ crossing the magnetic field Br, due to the Lorentz Force.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Acoustic wave {{devices have}} gained {{enormous}} interest for sensor applications. In the current practice, the {{surface acoustic waves}} are usually generated and measured by piezoelectric transducers. In this work, however, we propose to generate the acoustic waves by using a magnetostrictive transducer using magneticstrictive nickel strip gratings and a sensing <b>coil.</b> The <b>coil</b> <b>encircling</b> the gratings converts the magnetic flux change induced by the strain of the strips into voltage change, and vise versa. The main motivation using magnetostrictive transducers, not piezoelectric transducers, is that the wave generation and measurement can be achieved without direct wiring to the magnetostrictive nickel gratings. In addition, the transducer can be costeffective. It is shown that the grating distance can be so tuned to the center frequency that narrow-band wave signals can be effectively excited and measured. Introduction: Most of currently-available acoustic wave filters use piezoelectric transducers (1). In this work, however, we will consider {{the possibility of using}} alternative magnetostrictive transducers to develop an acoustic wave filter. The magnetostrictive effect refers to the coupling phenomena between the mechanical field and the magnetic field. When a mechanical load is applied to a ferromagnetic material, its magnetic field distribution changes, and vice versa (2 - 4). When piezoelectric materials are used for acoustic wave filters, they are arranged in...|$|R
5000|$|The {{basic concept}} {{was a way}} to modify the torus layout so that it {{addressed}} Fermi's concerns though the device's geometry. By twisting one end of the torus compared to the other, forming a figure-8 layout instead of a circle, the drift caused by the magnet windings being too close together {{on one side of the}} device would be counteracted by them being too far apart on the other. The particles would alternately drift one way and then the other. The cancellation was not perfect, but it appeared this would so greatly reduce the net drift rates that the fuel would remain trapped long enough to heat it to the required temperatures. His 1958 description was simple and direct: Magnetic confinement in the stellarator is based on a strong magnetic field produced by solenoidal <b>coils</b> <b>encircling</b> a toroidal tube. The configuration is characterized by a 'rotational transform', such that a single line of magnetic force, followed around the system, intersects a cross-sectional plane in points which successively rotate about the magnetic axis. ... A rotational transform may be generated either by a solenoidal field in a twisted, or figure-eight shaped, tube, or by the use of an additional transverse multipolar helical field, with helical symmetry.|$|R
40|$|Magnetic {{reconnection}} is {{an important}} and prevalent plasma physics phenomenon occurring in astrophysical (solar flares), space (magnetospheric substorms), and laboratory settings (tokamak sawtooth oscillations). It allows {{for a change in}} the magnetic field topology in plasmas while also transferring the magnetic field energy to plasma energy. In return, the global magnetic field topology can affect the dynamics of reconnection. Major advances have been made in understanding reconnection in two dimensions, which, however, are not necessarily applicable to fully three dimensional settings. We aim to add to the fundamental understanding of reconnection in three dimensions through observations in controlled laboratory experiments. To that effect we constructed and characterized an experimental setup at the Versatile Toroidal Facility that includes a washer plasma gun and a suite of diagnostics. We pulse a coil that drives reconnection along an X-line and also forms magnetic nulls in the plasma. We theoretically and experimentally investigated the relevant magnetic field configurations of a current coil in a background magnetic field. Notably, a coil tilted with respect to the background field produces nested separatrix surfaces consisting of field lines that <b>encircle</b> the null <b>coil</b> a certain number of times. The results are, {{to the best of our}} knowledge, original and contain features of relevance to the interaction of the Earth's magnetic field with the interplanetary magnetic field. In addition, we observed diamagnetic currents near the null points and magnetic reconnection along the X-line. The effective resistivity of the current sheet is significantly larger than the classical Spitzer resistivity. Thus, the observed reconnection cannot be explained as Sweet-Parker reconnection mediated by the classical resistivity. The reconnection current sheet extends to an azimuthal current sheet around the plasma beam. The azimuthal current sheet also is consistent with diamagnetic currents. by Arturs Vrublevskis.
