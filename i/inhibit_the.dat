5|$|Cytotoxic drugs <b>inhibit</b> <b>the</b> immune {{response}} by killing dividing cells such as activated T cells. However, the killing is indiscriminate and other constantly dividing cells and their organs are affected, which causes toxic side effects.

5|$|Galiella rufa {{produces}} several structurally related hexaketide {{compounds that}} have attracted attention for their biological properties: pregaliellalactone, galiellalactone. The compounds have anti-nematodal activity, killing the nematodes Caenorhabditis elegans and Meloidogyne incognita. These compounds {{have been shown}} in laboratory tests to <b>inhibit</b> <b>the</b> early steps of the biosynthetic pathways induced by plant hormones known as gibberellic acids, and they also <b>inhibit</b> <b>the</b> germination of seeds of several plants. Galiellalactone is additionally a highly selective and potent inhibitor of interleukin-6 (IL-6) signaling in HepG2 cells. IL-6 is a multifunctional cytokine which is produced by a large variety of cells and functions as a regulator of immune response, acute phase reactions, and hematopoiesis. Researchers {{are interested in the}} potential of small-molecule inhibitors (such as the ones produced by G.rufa) to interfere with the IL-6 signaling cascade that leads to the expression of genes involved in disease.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} analyze the {{antimicrobial}} activity of black cumin (Nigella sativa) extracts in <b>inhibiting</b> <b>the</b> growth of pathogenic and spoilage bacteria. Black cumin was extracted by using steam distillation, single solvent extraction, and continuous solvent extraction. Ethanol extract was the best extract in <b>inhibiting</b> <b>the</b> growth of bacteria while both aqueous and hexane extracts were less effective as antimicrobial agents. Ethanol extract, essential oil, and ethyl acetate extract have a broad antimicrobial spectrum. The chemical composition of the essential oil was analyzed using a GC-MS technique.

5|$|A {{number of}} factors are {{involved}} in suppression of inflammation by erythromycin and other macrolides. They are especially effective at inhibiting the proliferation of neutrophils, by diminishing the ability of interleukin 8 and leukotriene B4 to attract them. Macrolides also reduce the efficiency of adhesion molecules that allow neutrophils to stick to bronchiolar tissue linings. Mucus production in the airways is a major culprit in the morbidity and mortality of DPB and other respiratory diseases. The significant reduction of inflammation in DPB attributed to erythromycin therapy also helps to <b>inhibit</b> <b>the</b> production of excess mucus.|$|E

5|$|After {{reaching}} a virtual stalemate {{with these two}} wars against the Afghans, the British imposed the Durand Line in 1893, which divided Afghanistan and British India (now the North-West Frontier Province, Federally Administered Tribal Areas (F.A.T.A.) and Balochistan provinces of Pakistan). Named after Sir Mortimer Durand, the foreign secretary of the British Indian government, it was agreed upon by the Emir of Afghanistan (Abdur Rahman Khan) and {{the representatives of the}} British Empire but deeply resented by the Afghans. Its intended purpose was to serve as a buffer zone to <b>inhibit</b> <b>the</b> spread of Russian influence down into British India.|$|E
5|$|An inverse agonist {{can have}} effects {{similar to those}} of an antagonist, but causes a {{distinct}} set of downstream biological responses. Constitutively active receptors that exhibit intrinsic or basal activity can have inverse agonists, which not only block the effects of binding agonists like a classical antagonist but also <b>inhibit</b> <b>the</b> basal activity of the receptor. Many drugs previously classified as antagonists are now beginning to be reclassified as inverse agonists because of the discovery of constitutive active receptors. Antihistamines, originally classified as antagonists of histamine H1 receptors have been reclassified as inverse agonists.|$|E
5|$|By definition, antagonists display no {{efficacy}} {{to activate}} the receptors they bind. Antagonists do not maintain the ability to activate a receptor. Once bound, however, antagonists <b>inhibit</b> <b>the</b> function of agonists, inverse agonists, and partial agonists. In functional antagonist assays, a dose-response curve measures {{the effect of the}} ability of a range of concentrations of antagonists to reverse the activity of an agonist. The potency of an antagonist is usually defined by its half maximal inhibitory concentration (i.e., IC50 value). This can be calculated for a given antagonist by determining the concentration of antagonist needed to elicit half inhibition of the maximum biological response of an agonist. Elucidating an IC50 value is useful for comparing the potency of drugs with similar efficacies, however the dose-response curves produced by both drug antagonists must be similar. The lower the IC50 the greater the potency of the antagonist, and the lower the concentration of drug that is required to <b>inhibit</b> <b>the</b> maximum biological response. Lower concentrations of drugs may be associated with fewer side-effects.|$|E

40|$|Essential oils are {{mixtures}} of volatile, lipophilic compounds originating from plants. Some essential oils have useful biological activities including antimicrobial, spasmolytic, antiplasmodial, and insect-repelling activities. In this study, {{we tested the}} anti-microbial activity of essential oil prepared from the aromatic plant, Cymbopogon citrates, against three important plant patho-genic and medical microorganisms, Pectobacterium carotovorum, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, and Aspergillus niger.

5|$|Clearly, some tumors {{evade the}} immune system and go on to become cancers. Tumor cells often have a reduced number of MHC class I {{molecules}} on their surface, thus avoiding detection by killer T cells. Some tumor cells also release products that <b>inhibit</b> <b>the</b> immune response; for example by secreting the cytokine TGF-β, which suppresses the activity of macrophages and lymphocytes. In addition, immunological tolerance may develop against tumor antigens, so {{the immune system}} no longer attacks the tumor cells.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{also are}} used to inhibit enzymes needed for the {{survival}} of pathogens. For example, bacteria are surrounded by a thick cell wall made of a net-like polymer called peptidoglycan. Many antibiotics such as penicillin and vancomycin <b>inhibit</b> <b>the</b> enzymes that produce and then cross-link the strands of this polymer together. This causes the cell wall to lose strength and the bacteria to burst. In the figure, a molecule of penicillin (shown in a ball-and-stick form) is shown bound to its target, the transpeptidase from the bacteria Streptomyces R61 (the protein is shown as a ribbon-diagram).|$|E

The {{study examined}} whether the simple phenolic compound octyl gallate affects ATP-induced Ca 2 + signaling in PC 12 cells using fura- 2 -based digital Ca 2 + imaging and whole-cell patch clamping. Treatment with ATP (100 µM) for 90 s induced increases in [Ca 2 +]i in PC 12 cells. Pretreatment with octyl gallate (100 nM to 20 µM) for 10 min <b>inhibited</b> <b>the</b> ATP-induced [Ca 2 +]i response in a concentration-dependent manner (IC 50 = 2. 84 µM). Treatment with octyl gallate (3 µM) for 10 min significantly <b>inhibited</b> <b>the</b> ATP-induced response following {{the removal of}} extracellular Ca 2 + with nominally Ca 2 +-free HEPES HBSS or depletion of intracellular Ca 2 + stores with thapsigargin (1 µM). Treatment for 10 min with the L-type Ca 2 + channel antagonist nimodipine (1 µM) significantly <b>inhibited</b> <b>the</b> ATP-induced [Ca 2 +]i increase, and treatment with octyl gallate further <b>inhibited</b> <b>the</b> ATP-induced response. Treatment with octyl gallate significantly <b>inhibited</b> <b>the</b> [Ca 2 +]i increase induced by 50 mM KCl. Pretreatment with protein kinase C inhibitors staurosporin (100 nM) and GF 109203 X (300 nM), or the tyrosine kinase inhibitor genistein (50 µM) did not significantly affect the inhibitory effects of octyl gallate on the ATP-induced response. Treatment with octyl gallate markedly <b>inhibited</b> <b>the</b> ATP-induced currents. Therefore, we conclude that octyl gallate inhibits ATP-induced [Ca 2 +]i increase in PC 12 cells by inhibiting both non-selective P 2 X receptor-mediated influx of Ca 2 + from extracellular space and P 2 Y receptor-induced release of Ca 2 + from intracellular stores in protein kinase-independent manner.
