40|$|Two {{different}} viral DNA-defective temperature-sensitive mutants of adenovirus 12 (H 12) were defective {{in their}} ability to induce the synthesis of various molecular weight classes of nuclear <b>acidic</b> <b>proteins,</b> both virion and nonvirion components, after lytic infection of human embryo kidney (HEK) cells at the restrictive temperature. This finding indicates that the induction of nuclear <b>acidic</b> <b>protein</b> synthesis is an adenovirus gene function(s). Treatment of infected cells with actinomycin D at an early stage of virus maturation suppressed the synthesis of an <b>acidic</b> virion <b>protein</b> (hexon), but allowed the synthesis of other classes of nuclear nonvirion <b>acidic</b> <b>proteins</b> during the subsequent late maturation period, suggesting that different mechanisms control virion and nonvirion polypeptide synthesis. The interaction of the nuclear <b>acidic</b> <b>proteins</b> isolated from H 12 -infected cells with native-labeled H 12 DNA was studied using the membrane filter technique. Measurements of the ability of different DNA preparations to inhibit the H 12 DNA-acidic protein complex formation suggest that the nuclear <b>acidic</b> <b>proteins</b> bound to native H 12 or HEK cell DNA with much higher affinity than to native calf thymus DNA. Moreover, native H 12 DNA was able to bind the <b>acidic</b> <b>proteins</b> more efficiently than did denatured H 12 DNA. The <b>acidic</b> <b>proteins</b> isolated from the cytoplasm of H 12 -infected cells bound approximately 100 -fold less to native H 12 DNA than did the nuclear proteins. Furthermore, the H 12 DNA binding affinity of the nuclear <b>acidic</b> <b>proteins</b> from uninfected cells, or from H 12 -infected and 1 -beta-D-arabinofuranosylcytosine-treated cells, was somewhat lower than that of the nuclear proteins from infected (untreated) cells...|$|R

40|$|Nuclear <b>acidic</b> <b>proteins</b> {{have been}} implicated in the {{positive}} control of gene transcription in eukaryotes. This hypothesis was examined in greater detail by analysis of these proteins during experimental gene activation by a technique for fractionating nuclei into chromatin and the ribonucleoprotein particles that contain heterogeneous nuclear RNA. When synthesis of rat-liver heterogeneous nuclear RNA was stimulated by administration of hydrocortisone, there was a parallel increase in the labeling of <b>acidic</b> <b>proteins</b> in ribonucleoprotein particles. However, there was no detectable effect on the labeling of either <b>acidic</b> chromatin <b>proteins</b> or histones. Thus, the nuclear <b>acidic</b> <b>proteins</b> that respond to the hormone are concerned with a post-transcriptional event, namely the assembly and processing of ribonucleoprotein particles that contain heterogeneous RNA, rather than with direct gene activation.

No effect was seen on the number of immunoreactive glia. Intact adult males had significantly higher glial fibrillary <b>acidic</b> <b>protein</b> messenger RNA levels and glial fibrillary <b>acidic</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactive surface density than females. Both adult and neonatal castration of male animals significantly reduced glial fibrillary <b>acidic</b> <b>protein</b> messenger RNA levels and glial fibrillary <b>acidic</b> <b>protein</b> immunoreactive surface density. Neonatal and adult testosterone treatment increased both of these parameters in both sexes; however, there was no additive effect of the steroid treatments. Glial cells are involved in the proliferation, survival, migration and maturation of neurons, {{as well as in the}} modulation of synaptic connectivity, and therefore it follows that hormonal modulation of glia may mediate some of the known steroid effects on neurons. The data reported here show that astroglia are significantly influenced by both the neonatal and adult sex steroid environments and suggest that some of the steroid effects on neurons during both of these developmental periods may be mediated, at least in part, through modulation of glial cells.

40|$|The {{activation}} of hepatic stellate cells is {{the conversion of}} quiescent cells into proliferative, contractile, and fibrogenic myofibroblasts. The alpha-smooth muscle actin is a well known marker of hepatic stellate cells activation. On the other hand, the Glial Fibrillary <b>Acidic</b> <b>Protein</b> expression is a key step in the astrocytes differentiation and constitutes the hallmark response of astrocytes to injury. Glial Fibrillary <b>Acidic</b> <b>Protein</b> expression was reported in quiescent stellate cells in vivo, with an increased expression in the acute response to injury in the rat, and a down-regulation in the chronic one. This study aims to evaluate the morphologic characteristics, distribution and percentage of Glial Fibrillary <b>Acidic</b> <b>Protein</b> expressing cells in normal and injured human livers. Human liver biopsies (n= 32) were divided in three groups: 1) donors liver; 2) chronic hepatitis C-virus related; 3) post-viral hepatitis cirrhosis. Samples were immunostained with anti- alpha-smooth muscle actin and anti- Glial Fibrillary <b>Acidic</b> <b>Protein</b> antibody. Subsequently they were semi-quantitatively evaluated. Liver fibrosis was quantified by morphometric analysis. In chronic hepatitis livers and in the cirrhotic ones, hepatic stellate cells became larger with long cytoplasmic processes. The alpha-smooth muscle actin -positive stellate cells increase and expand from areas of piecemeal necrosis to the entire residual parenchyma with the progression of the fibrosis. By contrast Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein-positive stellate cells are more evenly distributed in the earlier stages and confined to {{the periphery of the}} hepatic lobule in the advanced ones. Also some endothelial cells were Glial Fibrillary <b>Acidic</b> <b>Protein</b> positive in vessels of the expanding septa and at the edges of cirrhotic nodules. Glial Fibrillary <b>Acidic</b> <b>Protein</b> expression in the liver is probably linked to the fine modulation of the cytoskeleton during the formation of cytoplasmic processes in both stellate cells and endothelial cells. In the latter Glial Fibrillary <b>Acidic</b> <b>Protein</b> expression might be related to the remodelling of the vascular bed that occurs during the response to injuries. Otherwise in hepatic stellate cells {{it seems to be a}} marker related with the acquisition of contractile properties in a subpopulation more closely associated with precocious stages of the fibrosis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractPhospholipase D {{has been}} implicated in {{membrane}} traffic in the secretory pathway of yeast and of some mammalian cell lines. Here we investigated the involvement of phospholipase D in protein transport at various steps of the secretory pathway of mammary epithelial cells. Treatment of rabbit mammary explants with butanol, which blocks the formation of phosphatidic acid, decreased the secretion of caseins {{and to a lesser}} extent that of whey <b>acidic</b> <b>protein.</b> Butanol interfered with both the endoplasmic reticulum to Golgi complex transport of the caseins and secretory vesicle formation from the trans-Golgi network. In contrast, the transport of whey <b>acidic</b> <b>protein</b> to the Golgi was less affected. Activation of protein kinase C enhanced the overall secretion of both markers and interestingly, this stimulation of secretion was maintained for whey <b>acidic</b> <b>protein</b> in the presence of butanol. Transphosphatidylation assays demonstrated the existence of a constitutive phospholipase D activity which was stimulated by the activation of protein kinase C. We conclude that phospholipase D plays a role in casein transport from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi and in the secretory vesicle formation from the trans-Golgi network. Moreover, our results suggest a differential requirement for phospholipase D in the secretion of caseins and that of whey <b>acidic</b> <b>protein...</b>|$|R
