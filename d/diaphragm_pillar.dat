40|$|Previous {{research}} on trichinellosis in Africa focused on isolating Trichinella from wildlife while {{the role of}} domestic pigs has remained highly under-researched. Pig keeping in Uganda is historically recent, and evidence on zoonotic pig diseases, including infection with Trichinella species, is scarce. A cross-sectional survey on Trichinella seroprevalence in pigs was conducted in three districts in Central and Eastern Uganda from April 2013 to January 2015. Serum from {{a random sample of}} 1125 pigs from 22 villages in Eastern and Central Uganda was examined to detect immunoglobulin G (IgG) against any Trichinella spp. using a commercially available ELISA based on excretory-secretory antigen. ELISA positive samples were confirmed using Western Blot based on somatic antigen of Trichinella spiralis as recommended in previous validation studies. <b>Diaphragm</b> <b>pillar</b> muscle samples (at least 5 g each) of 499 pigs from areas with high ELISA positivity were examined using the artificial digestion method. Overall, 78 of all 1125 animals (6. 9 %, 95 % CI: 5. 6 – 8. 6 %) tested positive for antibodies against Trichinella spp. in the ELISA at significantly higher levels in Kamuli district compared to Masaka and Mukono districts. Thirty-one percent of the ELISA positive samples were confirmed IgG positive by the Western Blot leading to an overall seroprevalence of 2. 1 % (95 % CI: 1. 4 – 3. 2 %). The large proportion of ELISA positive samples that could not be confirmed using Western blot {{may be the result of}} cross-reactivity with other gastrointestinal helminth infections or unknown host-specific immune response mechanisms in local pig breeds in Uganda. Attempts to isolate muscle larvae for species determination using the artificial digestion method were unsuccessful. Due to the large number of muscle samples examined we are confident that even if pigs are infected, the larval burden in pork is too low to pose a major risk to consumers of developing trichinellosis. This was the first large systematic field investigation of Trichinella infection in domestic pigs in Uganda and its results imply that further studies are needed to identify the Trichinella species involved, and to identify potential sources of infection for humans.

40|$|An eleven year-old, male, beagle was {{presented}} with a two-month history of progressive stiff gait and spinal hyperalgesia. On the basis of clinical and magnetic resonance images features, an extensive bilateral paraspinal myopathy was diagnosed. Two weeks later, the dog was euthanized due to the worsening of pain. At post-mortem examination, multiple nodules of variable size were detected along the lumbar paraspinal musculature and the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pillars.</b> Histologically, nodules were composed by fibroconnectival proliferation arranged around cores of atypical neoplastic cells which were positive for cytokeratine 19, demonstrating a glandular origin. A primary lesion was not found. Here we report an atypical case of adenocarcinoma of unknown primary origin metastasizing to the lumbar muscles and presenting with severe neuropathic pain...|$|R
40|$|The {{comparison}} of the sensitivities of two molecular assays designed to target the multi-copy sequences of the Toxoplasma gondii genomic B 1 region and 529 bp-RE respectively, in detecting T. gondii in swine muscle was assessed. <b>Diaphragm</b> <b>pillars</b> were obtained from 498 slaughtered pigs managed in intensive farms in Central Italy. Genomic DNA was extracted from the tissues and T. gondii-B 1 and 529 bp-RE sequences were amplified by specific PCR protocols. Toxoplasma gondii DNA was detected in 165 samples (33. 13 %). There was a good correlation (κ = 0. 77) between the results obtained targeting the two different genetic markers, however the 529 bp RE-PCR assay overall detected a significantly higher (P < 0. 05) number of T. gondii-positive samples (150 samples) than the B 1 -PCR protocol (134). Our results show that: i) standardized B 1 and 529 bp-RE PCRs applied to muscle tissues can detect {{a high rate of}} T. gondii-infection; ii) a multi-target PCR approach is recommended for the accurate diagnosis of infection in swine and can also be used in food testing...|$|R
40|$|Gastroesophageal reflux {{disease is}} a {{significant}} public health concern. Antireflux surgery has become an accepted solution for many patients especially since the introduction of minimally invasive procedures [1]. Robotic surgery provides a three-dimensional vision with articulated instruments resulting in greater dexterity for surgeons [2] and [3]. This video shows different steps necessary to perform a posterior fundoplication using Nissen-Rossetti technique. The patient is placed in a supine reversed Trendelenburg position. A 12 -mm trocar, for the robotic camera, is positioned in the left paraumbilical region. Two 8 -mm robotic ports are inserted into the right hypochondrium and the left subcostal region. A 12 -mm extra-port for accessory instruments controlled by the assistant is placed at the supraumbilical region. Mobilisation of the esophagus requires {{the opening of the}} upper part of the small omentum (pars condensa). The phrenoesophageal membrane is incised, using the cautery hook. The <b>diaphragm</b> <b>pillars</b> are then visualized. A ribbon is passed around the esophagus, allowing the enlargement of the dissection and lowering the esophagus by 4 – 5 cm. The left pillar is sutured to the right one avoiding oesophageal stenosis. The dissection of the esophagus must be sufficient to allow the large gastric tuberosity to pass freely at the posterior part of the esophagus. A Nissen fundoplication with the Rossetti modification is carried out, paying attention to the preservation of the vagus nerves. The large tuberosity is sutured onto itself using simple stitches, wrapping the abdominal esophagus with a 360 ° angle. The height of the fundoplication is expected to be about 2 – 3 cm. This video is useful for all surgeons having to perform a laparoscopic or robotic Nissen-Rossetti fundoplication...|$|R
