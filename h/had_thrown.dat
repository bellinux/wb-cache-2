5|$|According to {{a verdict}} {{delivered}} by the Municipal Court in Prague on March 5, 2013, it was proven that Blythe <b>had</b> <b>thrown</b> Nosek offstage and thus had moral responsibility for his death. However, due to the circumstances, Blythe was not held criminally liable, {{and most of the}} blame lay with promoters and security members. The acquittal was upheld by the Prague High Court on June 5, 2013.|$|E
5|$|The {{court held}} that it was proven that Blythe <b>had</b> <b>thrown</b> Nosek off the stage. However, Blythe, due to his nearsightedness, could have mistaken Nosek for the other fan who had {{repeatedly}} gotten over the guardrail. According to the court, the largest part of the blame lies with the promoters and security members. Judge Kubovec further reproached Blythe for not having met with the Nosek family.|$|E
5000|$|While Bledsoe <b>has</b> <b>thrown</b> for a {{high number}} of yards and attempts, a {{frequent}} criticism is that they are based on volume (attempts, completions, yards) rather than efficiency (passer rating, TD-to-INT ratio, yards per attempt) proving only that he <b>has</b> <b>thrown</b> a great number of times, not that he <b>has</b> <b>thrown</b> well. According to sports writer Don Banks, Bledsoe's large career totals [...] "reveal more about his longevity than about his excellence".|$|R

5|$|By {{contrast}} Yoshiaki Itakura {{adopted an}} even stricter standard than Hata, advocating that only Chinese soldiers captured in uniform and then killed be included as massacre victims. He argued that Chinese soldiers who <b>had</b> <b>thrown</b> away their uniforms were legally executed because {{the laws of}} war at the time did not apply to them, though this line of reasoning is hotly disputed by other historians. Most Japanese ultranationalists who deny the Nanking Massacre admit that the Japanese Army killed a large number of Chinese POWs, though they consider these to be legal executions, an argument denounced by mainstream historians.|$|E

During interview six, he said he had hit Blakelock with an iron bar in the chest and leg. Rose writes that there were no such injuries on Blakelock's body. In a seventh interview, he said he had hit a police officer, but that it was not Blakelock. On the basis of this confession evidence, he was charged with murder.|$|E
5|$|His first no-hitter, on July 12, 1951, was a 1–0 {{defeat of}} his former team, the Indians. Gene Woodling's solo home run was the only run scored during the game. Reynolds retired the last 17 Indians he faced. Only four Indians reached base; he walked three and Bobby Ávila reached on an error by Phil Rizzuto. It was his third shutout of Cleveland that season. Bob Feller also threw a strong game and didn't allow a hit until the sixth inning, when Mickey Mantle doubled. Feller threw a {{complete}} game and allowed only four hits. Feller <b>had</b> <b>thrown</b> a no-hitter eleven days earlier.|$|E
5|$|Immediately after Warne and Waugh had met John in Colombo, Australia {{defeated}} Pakistan in {{a one-day}} match, scoring 7/179 and restricting Pakistan to 9/151 in reply. There were suspicions that the Pakistanis <b>had</b> <b>thrown</b> {{the game by}} batting slowly, although Warne said he had genuinely tried his best, pointing {{out that he was}} named man-of-the-match. Warne and May had alleged that Malik offered them money to bowl badly {{on the final day of}} the First Test in Karachi. Australia then reduced Pakistan from 3/157 to 9/258, and appeared set for victory, but a last-wicket partnership took them to the target of 314. The win was registered when wicket-keeper Ian Healy missed a stumping chance from Warne and the ball went for four byes. Warne denied that he <b>had</b> <b>thrown</b> the match, again pointing out he was named man-of-the-match. Waugh had alleged that Malik offered him money to help Australia lose a one-day match during the same tour. He denied the allegation that he did so. Waugh scored an unbeaten 121, but it was not enough to prevent Australia from suffering a nine-wicket defeat.|$|E

The Carthaginians <b>had</b> <b>thrown</b> open the gates and illuminated the city in celebration, but Belisarius, fearing a possible ambush in the darkness and wishing to keep his soldiers under tight control, refrained from entering the city, and encamped before it.|$|E
5|$|New York won the {{following}} week against Minnesota before facing the Buffalo Bills in their regular season home finale. Despite holding a significant advantage in time of possession, they lost 17–13, for their third loss in four games. To compound New York's problems, Phil Simms went down with an injury that would sideline him {{for the rest of}} the year. His replacement, Jeff Hostetler, was an unproven career backup, who <b>had</b> <b>thrown</b> a mere 68 passes coming into the season.|$|E

On the lighter side he took his second national title, consolidating his spot as Norway's leading javelin thrower.|$|E

Ironically, Sanchez would get his first playing time when Bradford was playing his best football of the season.|$|E

Lamb was arrested at 15:30 on 26 June and charged with the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski. Under the terms of Canadian law at that time, he faced a mandatory death penalty if convicted. When Woloch's injuries also proved fatal at 14:45 on 11 July 1966, his murder was added to Lamb's charge.|$|E
