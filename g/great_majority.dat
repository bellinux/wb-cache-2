5|$|I {{advocate}} the industrial ballot alone when I address {{the workers in}} the textile industries of the East where a <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> are foreigners without political representation. But when I speak to American workingmen in the West I advocate both the industrial and the political ballot.|$|E

5|$|The <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> {{of the art}} in {{and around}} the Houses of Parliament is of British origin, due to a policy of {{acquiring}} British art for the building. Marochetti's statue thus represents one of the few examples of a non-British artist's work being selected for the Parliamentary estate.|$|E
5|$|I {{have come}} to {{know that there is a}} real {{difference}} between the regular German soldier and officer and Hitler and his criminal group. For my part, I do not believe that the German soldier as such has lost his honor. The fact that certain individuals committed in war dishonorable and despicable acts reflects on the individuals concerned and not on the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> of German soldiers and officers.|$|E
5|$|Labor {{was always}} in short supply. The most common {{solution}} was indentured servitude of young whites. These were teenagers in Britain or Germany whose parents arranged for them to work for families in the colonies until age 21, {{in exchange for their}} ocean passage. The <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> became farmers or farm wives. By the mid-eighteenth century, African American slaves comprised 12% of the population of New York. Most were house servants in Manhattan, or farmworkers on Dutch estates.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the strongest}} bases of anti-Communist {{sentiment}} in the United States was the Catholic community, which constituted over 20% of the national vote. McCarthy identified himself as Catholic, and although the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> of Catholics were Democrats, as his fame as a leading anti-Communist grew, he became popular in Catholic communities across the country, with strong support from many leading Catholics, diocesan newspapers, and Catholic journals.|$|E
5|$|Some species, {{such as the}} gregarious German cockroach, have an {{elaborate}} social structure involving common shelter, social dependence, information transfer and kin recognition. Cockroaches have appeared in human culture since classical antiquity.

5|$|The 2001 census {{revealed}} {{there were}} only three second homes in the village, but that many villagers commuted each day to work. The <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> of properties are owner-occupied, with just over 100 rented from the council or private landlords. Most of the houses (over 500) are classified as detached, the average number of rooms per property is 6.0 and the average household size is 2.3.|$|E

5|$|The living {{members of}} the Diplopoda are divided into sixteen orders in two {{subclass}}es. The basal subclass Penicillata contains a single order, Polyxenida (bristle millipedes). All other millipedes belong to the subclass Chilognatha consisting of two infraclasses: Pentazonia, containing the short-bodied pill millipedes, and Helminthomorpha (worm-like millipedes), containing the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> of the species.|$|E
5|$|With few exceptions, each neuron in {{the brain}} {{releases}} the same chemical neurotransmitter, or combination of neurotransmitters, at all the synaptic connections it makes with other neurons; this rule is known as Dale's principle. Thus, a neuron can be characterized by the neurotransmitters that it releases. The <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> of psychoactive drugs exert their effects by altering specific neurotransmitter systems. This applies to drugs such as cannabinoids, nicotine, heroin, cocaine, alcohol, fluoxetine, chlorpromazine, and many others.|$|E
5|$|After the {{unification}} of the peninsula up to Taedong River in 668 AD, Gyeongju {{became the center of}} Korean political and cultural life. The city was home to the Silla court and the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> of the kingdom's elite. Its prosperity became legendary, and was reported as far away as Persia according to the 9th century book The Book of Roads and Kingdoms. Records of Samguk Yusa give the city's population in its peak period as 178,936 households, suggesting that the total population was almost one million. Many of Gyeongju's most famous sites date from this Unified Silla period, which ended in the late 9th century by Goryeo (918–1392).|$|E
30|$|All {{participants}} had completed industry internships. The <b>greater</b> <b>majority</b> (67.2 %) had 6  months or less experience, while 13 % reported {{having more than}} 9  months’ work experience in industry.

He won by a <b>greater</b> <b>majority</b> in the 1962 election, but defeated PC candidate Sydney Sarbitt by only 40 votes in that of 1966. He retired from the legislature in 1969.|$|R
25|$|The Orthodox {{presence}} in Turkey itself is small; however {{the majority of}} Orthodox in North America (about two-thirds) are under the Ecumenical Patriarchate, primarily in the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of America. The Patriarchate also enjoys an even <b>greater</b> <b>majority</b> in the United Kingdom. Furthermore, the Albanian, Carpatho-Russian and Ukrainian jurisdictions in America {{are also part of}} the Patriarchate.|$|R
5|$|Apart {{from his}} own disciples and followers, the Jews of Jesus' day {{generally}} rejected him as the Messiah, as do the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> of Jews today. Christian theologians, ecumenical councils, reformers and others have written extensively about Jesus over the centuries. Christian sects and schisms have often been defined or characterized by their descriptions of Jesus. Meanwhile, Manichaeans, Gnostics, Muslims, Baha'is, and others have found prominent places for Jesus in their religions. Jesus has also had detractors, both past and present.|$|E
5|$|Cooked {{tarantula}} spiders {{are considered}} a delicacy in Cambodia, and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela. Spider venoms may be a less polluting alternative to conventional pesticides as they are deadly to insects but the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> are harmless to vertebrates. Possible medical uses for spider venoms are being investigated, {{for the treatment of}} cardiac arrhythmia, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and erectile dysfunction. Because spider silk is both light and very strong, attempts are being made to produce it in goats' milk and in the leaves of plants, by means of genetic engineering.|$|E
5|$|Freshwater and {{terrestrial}} molluscs appear exceptionally {{vulnerable to}} extinction. Estimates {{of the numbers}} of nonmarine molluscs vary widely, partly because many regions have not been thoroughly surveyed. There is also a shortage of specialists who can identify all the animals in any one area to species. However, in 2004 the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species included nearly 2,000 endangered nonmarine molluscs. For comparison, the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> of mollusc species are marine, but only 41 of these appeared on the 2004 Red List. About 42% of recorded extinctions since the year 1500 are of molluscs, consisting almost entirely of nonmarine species.|$|E

2500|$|The {{elections}} of 1934 might have reflected the [...] "radical upheaval sweeping the country", as Roosevelt won the <b>greatest</b> <b>majority</b> either party ever {{held in the}} Senate and 322 Democrats won seats in the United States House of Representatives versus 103 Republicans. It is possible that [...] "the great social movement from below thus strengthened {{the independence of the}} executive branch of government".|$|R
50|$|At the August 13 {{convention}} {{called by}} the state Democratic Executive Committee to consider primary elections, the assembled delegates installed Tillmanites in leadership positions and soundly defeated calls for a primary election. A month later at the nominating convention on September 15, Tillman's supporters had an even <b>greater</b> <b>majority</b> than the preceding convention and Tillman {{was selected as the}} governor without opposition.|$|R
5|$|From 1890 to 1910, poll {{taxes and}} {{literacy}} tests were instituted across the South, effectively disenfranchising the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> of black men. White male-only primary elections also served {{to reduce the}} influence of black men in the political system. Along with increasing legal obstacles, blacks {{were excluded from the}} political system by threats of violent reprisals by whites in the form of lynch mobs and terrorist attacks by the Ku Klux Klan. Some Democrats even advocated a repeal of the amendment, such as William Bourke Cockran of New York.|$|E
5|$|In all 50,000 flame fougasse barrels were {{distributed}} {{of which the}} <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> were installed in 7,000 batteries, mostly in southern England and a little later at 2,000 sites in Scotland. Some barrels were held in reserve while others were deployed at storage sites to destroy petrol depots at short notice. The size of a battery varied from just one drum {{to as many as}} fourteen; a four barrel battery was the most common installation and the recommended minimum. Where possible, half the barrels in a battery were to contain the 40/60 mixture and half the sticky 5B mixture.|$|E
5|$|In the <b>great</b> <b>majority</b> of cells, smooth ER {{regions are}} scarce {{and are often}} partly smooth and partly rough. They are {{sometimes}} called transitional ER because they contain ER exit sites from which transport vesicles carrying newly synthesized proteins and lipids bud off for transport to the Golgi apparatus. In certain specialized cells, however, the smooth ER is abundant and has additional functions. The smooth ER of these specialized cells functions in diverse metabolic processes, including synthesis of lipids, metabolism of carbohydrates, and detoxification of drugs and poisons.|$|E
