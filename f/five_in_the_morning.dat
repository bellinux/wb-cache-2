5|$|As a {{preparation}} for the World Championships in Tuscany Van Dijk went during the season {{a few times to}} Italy to practise the time trial course. She trained at <b>five</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> to avoid traffic and made video recordings of the course {{to get to know the}} turns. In the week before the World Championships she won the French time trial Chrono Champenois – Trophée Européen. All the preparations paid off and the World Championships were very successful for Van Dijk. With her team she won for the second consecutive year the world title in the team time trial. Because Van Dijk had won almost all the time trials this year she was also the main favourite for the individual time trial. Despite the pressure she won the time trial with a convincing victory and became the second Dutch women to win this title. At the end of the championships, Van Dijk finished 16th on a non-preferable hilly road race course.|$|E
5|$|German {{was first}} {{introduced}} into the curriculum in 1931, the same time at which the school began to offer voluntary after-school art classes. F. H. Taylor attempted to achieve equilibrium in the curriculum between arts and science subjects; he made woodwork and art continuous for an entire term and introduced a geography course for the Higher School Certificate. In 1948 rural biology {{was added to the}} curriculum for the first time, for which the headmaster provided a plot of land {{to be used as a}} vegetable plot. At the end of that year, an after-school study period was introduced; following the seven normal periods (<b>five</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> two in the afternoon), students were to either begin their homework, or attend a school society. However, the 1950s saw a definite swing towards maths and science, and a subsequent increase in staffing in those departments. In 1957, zoology and botany was taught at A-level for the first time, and physics and chemistry replaced rural biology at O-level (now replaced by the GCSE).|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, {{the canteen}} {{continued}} to operate as men were returning home. Eventually it closed on April 1, 1946 having served over six million servicemen and women. Sixteen trains were scheduled on the final day and regular Monday workers were in charge along with Lutheran Church women from North Platte, and Gothenburg, Nebraska. They would work from <b>five</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> until midnight, as they wouldn't know when the troop trains would come through as it was secret. Food was also donated during a time of rationing so that the soldiers could experience a taste of home of sorts.|$|E
25|$|The {{condemned}} soldiers (one sergeant, four corporals, {{and eight}} privates) {{were transferred to}} a barracks on December 10. That evening, motor trucks carried new lumber for scaffolds to some bathhouses built for the soldiers at Camp Travis near a swimming pool in the Salado Creek. The designated place of execution was several hundred yards away. Army engineers completed their work {{by the light of}} bonfires. The thirteen condemned men were awakened at <b>five</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and brought to the gallows. They were hanged simultaneously, at 7:17am, one minute before sunrise. The scaffolds were disassembled and every piece returned to Fort Sam Houston. The New York Times, commenting on the clean-up operations, observed the place of execution and place of burial were “indistinguishable.” Only army officers and County Sheriff John Tobin had been allowed to witness the execution.|$|E

[...] Pete Krebs also agreed: [...] "In Portland we got the brunt of Elliott's initial depression...

500|$|From the beginning, Crane {{wished to}} show {{how it felt to}} be in a war by writing [...] "a {{psychological}} portrayal of fear." [...] Conceiving his story {{from the point of view}} of a young private who is at first filled with boyish dreams of the glory of war and then quickly becomes disillusioned by war's reality, Crane borrowed the private's surname, [...] "Fleming", from his sister-in-law's maiden name. [...] He later said that the first paragraphs came to him with [...] "every word in place, every comma, every period fixed." [...] Working mostly nights, he wrote from around midnight until four or <b>five</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> [...] Because he could not afford a typewriter, he wrote carefully in ink on legal-sized paper, seldom crossing through or interlining a word. [...] If he did change something, he would rewrite the whole page.|$|E
500|$|It {{is a very}} {{important}} film, Life, and Nothing More..., in that what was filmed was inspired by a journey I had made just three days after an earthquake. And I speak not only of the film itself but also of the experience of being in that place, where only three days before 50,000 people had died. For the survivors, {{it was as if they}} were reborn, having experienced death around them. The earthquake had happened at four or <b>five</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> so in a sense everybody could have been dead and it was almost accidental that they hadn't died. So I didn't just see myself as a film director here, but also as an observer of people who had been condemned to death. So this was a very big influence on me, and the issue of life and death from then on does recur in my films[...]|$|E
500|$|One of the {{earliest}} accounts of an ascent of Helvellyn {{for the pleasure of}} doing so is contained in James Clarke's guidebook of 1787. He quotes the account of an unnamed gentleman from Penrith who wanted to eat his dinner on Midsummer Day while sitting in a snowdrift on top of Helvellyn. The man left home at two in the morning, rode to Glencoyne and left his horse at a house in the valley there. He started to walk up the mountain at between four and <b>five</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> and after five hours hot and hard work he reached the snow and the summit. The snow was covered with dust so he had to dig for clean snow to eat with his dinner. He returned by a different route, reaching Glencoyne ten hours after leaving it. This story seems to reflect the colder climatic conditions of the eighteenth century, during the so-called [...] "Little Ice Age".|$|E

500|$|At the time, Crane was {{intermittently}} {{employed as}} a free-lance writer, contributing articles to various New York City newspapers. He began writing what would become The Red Badge of Courage in June 1893, while living with his older brother Edmund in Lake View, New Jersey. Crane conceived the story {{from the point of}} view of a young private who is at first filled with boyish dreams of the glory of war, only to become disillusioned by war's reality. He took the private's surname, [...] "Fleming," [...] from his sister-in-law's maiden name.

[...] Working mostly nights, he wrote from around midnight until four or <b>five</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning.</b> Because he could not afford a typewriter, he carefully wrote in ink on legal-sized paper, occasionally crossing through or overlying a word. If he changed something, he would rewrite the whole page. He later moved to New York City, where he completed the novel in April 1894.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Beck {{released}} the single [...] "Timebomb", which {{was nominated for}} a Grammy Award for Best Solo Rock Vocal Performance. For his next studio effort, his tenth, Beck tapped Danger Mouse to produce, and the two first met in December 2007 to record. The duo knocked out two tracks in two days, but the notion that the album would be finished in a timely fashion soon evaporated. Beck had known Danger Mouse casually before, as many of his former musicians ended up working with Danger Mouse's side project, Gnarls Barkley. Still, the musicians were surprised at how well they got along. Following the grueling recording schedule, Beck was exhausted, calling it [...] "the most intense work I've ever done on anything", relating that he [...] "did at least 10 weeks with no days off, until four or <b>five</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning</b> every night." [...] Beck's original vision was a short 10-track burst with two-minute songs, but the songs gradually grew as he fit 'two years of songwriting into two and a half months." [...] Modern Guilt (2008) was [...] "full of off-kilter rhythms and left-field breakdowns, with an overall 1960s vibe." ...|$|E
500|$|Padukone has {{admitted}} to being socially awkward {{as a child}} and did not have many friends. The focus of her life was badminton, which she played competitively from a young age. Describing her daily routine in a 2012 interview, Padukone said, [...] "I would wake up at <b>five</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> go for physical training, go to school, again go for playing badminton, finish my homework, and go to sleep." [...] Padukone continued to pursue a career in badminton throughout her school years and played the sport in national level championships. She also played baseball in a few state level tournaments. While concentrating on her education and sporting career, Padukone also worked as a child model, first appearing in a couple of advertising campaigns at the age of eight. In the tenth grade, she changed focus and decided to become a fashion model. She later explained, [...] "I realised that I was playing the game only because it ran in the family. So, I asked my father if I could give up the game and he wasn't upset at all." [...] In 2004, she began a full-time career as a model under the tutelage of Prasad Bidapa.|$|E

[...] She averages 10–12 pages of material a day, which she edits down to three or four pages in the evening. [...] Angelou goes through this process to [...] "enchant" [...] herself, and as she said in a 1989 interview with the BBC, to [...] "relive the agony, the anguish, the Sturm und Drang". She places herself back in the time she is writing about, even during traumatic experiences like her rape in Caged Bird, to [...] "tell the human truth" [...] about her life.

500|$|In early May 1793, Custine {{designed}} {{a plan to}} cut off a body of the Coalition force that had ventured {{too far from the}} main force at Mainz. However, since he was about to take command of the Army of the North, he delegated some of the responsibility for this plan to Houchard (another ill-fated general destined for the guillotine), instructing him to attack Limbourg with the Army of the Moselle. The garrison at Landau was to make several feints to distract the Prussian troops. Custine also created and distributed a false report that the cavalry of the Army of the Moselle had arrived, and that they had also been reinforced by part of the artillery from Strasbourg. General Féry, who commanded an 40 battalions, was to throw himself on the Prussians until he heard that the principal engagement by Rheinzabern had begun. Custine left with his troops in the evening; several delays prevented him from arriving until <b>five</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>morning,</b> but Landremont engaged the Austrian army in the meanwhile and prevented them from advancing until Custine arrived and charged the Austrian post with two divisions of dragoons. Unfortunately, a battalion of French mistook Custine's dragoons for the enemy, and fired upon them with great accuracy. Any attempt to rally the battalion met with additional discharges. The commander, who apparently had no control over his troops, was denounced by both the representatives and his troops, and was arrested, but shot himself. Custine was disgusted with the affair: [...] "This day, which ought to have so memorable, terminated by the taking of one piece of cannon and a very great number of prisoners." [...] Custine was recalled to Paris on 15 July.|$|E
