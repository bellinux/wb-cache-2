5000|$|Sioux Chief {{no longer}} builds stock or {{produces}} leaded brass for F1807, F1960, F2080 or sweat fittings that {{fall under the}} necessary federal mandates. Federal legislation known as Federal Public Law 111-380 or the [...] "Reduction of Lead in Drinking Water Act" [...] a.k.a. [...] "Safe Drinking Water Act" [...] {{was signed into law}} in 2011 and eliminates the sale or installation of plumbing fixtures (drinking water pipes, pipe <b>fittings</b> and <b>plumbing</b> fixtures) with a wetted surface area containing more than a weighted average of 0.25% lead. National requirements allow for standard leaded brass to be installed up until January 4, 2014. However, these products will be non-compliant and obsolete as of January 4, 2014 and may not be grandfathered for continued use. The law requires pipes, pipe <b>fittings,</b> and <b>plumbing</b> <b>fittings</b> or fixtures, intended to convey or dispense water for human consumption through drinking or cooking, to meet the new “lead-free” definition. Additionally, any other end-use devices intended to convey or dispense water for human consumption through drinking or cooking must meet the new lead-free requirement. Examples of items covered by the new law include kitchen faucets, bathroom faucets and drinking water fountains.|$|R

40|$|The {{methodology}} and {{the processes that}} are followed in the maintenance of government-operated district hospitals in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa are outlined while the strategies that are employed to roll-out the maintenance plan have been investigated. The challenges in managing hospital maintenance are identified {{so that it can}} be improved and advice be given on the strategies currently being used. The objectives of the research were to determine the effectiveness of machinery maintenance in government-operated district hospitals. The study has been carried out by investigating 50 district hospitals within the Eastern Cape Province, with the aim of obtaining knowledge of practices in relation to the strategic plans and best practices in the maintenance industry. The following factors identified by the maintenance staff were found to be most important in maintenance management practices; realistic budgets, adherence to occupational health and safety regulations, engagement of qualified and skilled maintenance staff, good record management in relation to the equipment under maintenance, availability of tools and materials and keeping abreast with the latest technologies and trends of machinery advancement. The study also revealed that the majority of the hospitals use a combination of in-house and outsourced personnel during maintenance, the outsourced part being under contract from the National Department of Public Works Repair and Maintenance Plan (RAMP) projects. Service kits and recommended replacement parts for machinery are rarely stocked on the hospital premises while only minor spare parts that include replacement bulbs, electrical <b>fittings,</b> <b>plumbing</b> <b>fittings</b> and paint are readily available. In addition, the maintenance staff members have little or no input in maintenance budgeting, this aspect is controlled by hospital management. For maintenance to be effective, strategic planning that takes into account carefully thought-out maintenance management systems is the first step in the direction of setting out definite tangible objectives and goals. The real challenge lies in the implementation and sustainability of the maintenance management system and the monitoring thereo...|$|R

South African legislation requires that all plumbing components installed are approved by the SABS or local authority, but does not explicitly prohibit the importation and sale of such products.
