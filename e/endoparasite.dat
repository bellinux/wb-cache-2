5|$|The American robin {{is known}} to be a rejecter of cowbird eggs, so brood {{parasitism}} by the brown-headed cowbird is rare. Even when it occurs, the parasite's chick does not normally survive to fledging. In a study of 105 juvenile robins, 77.1% were infected with one or more species of <b>endoparasite,</b> with Syngamus species the most commonly encountered, found in 57.1% of the birds.|$|E
5|$|Bears are parasitized by eighty {{species of}} parasites, {{including}} single-celled protozoans and gastro-intestinal worms, and nematodes and flukes in their heart, liver, lungs and bloodstream. Externally they have ticks, fleas and lice. A study of American black bears found seventeen species of <b>endoparasite</b> including the protozoan Sarcocystis, the parasitic worm Diphyllobothrium mansonoides, and the nematodes Dirofilaria immitis, Capillaria aerophila, Physaloptera sp., Strongyloides sp. and others. Of these, D. mansonoides and adult C. aerophila were causing pathological symptoms. By contrast, polar bears have few parasites; many parasitic species need a secondary, usually terrestrial, host, and the polar bear's life style {{is such that}} few alternative hosts exist in their environment. The protozoan Toxoplasma gondii {{has been found in}} polar bears, and the nematode Trichinella nativa can cause a serious infection and decline in older polar bears. Bears in North America are sometimes infected by a Morbillivirus similar to the canine distemper virus. They are susceptible to infectious canine hepatitis (CAV-1), with free-living black bears dying rapidly of encephalitis and hepatitis.|$|E
25|$|Chilodonella uncinata has a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution. It is suspected {{to act as}} a facultative <b>endoparasite</b> of the larvae of the Culex, Aedes, and Anopheles mosquito larva. It lives in fresh water ponds, lakes, creeks, and bayous where it feeds on bacteria and other microbes.|$|E
50|$|Several <b>endoparasites</b> {{have been}} found in gerrids. Trypanosamatid flagellates, nematodes, and {{parasitic}} Hymenoptera all act as <b>endoparasites.</b> Water mite larvae act as ectoparasites of water striders.|$|R
50|$|Parasites {{are divided}} into two groups: <b>endoparasites</b> and ectoparasites. <b>Endoparasites</b> are parasites that live inside {{the body of the}} host, whereas ectoparasites are parasites that live on the outer surface of the host and {{generally}} attach themselves during feeding. Due to the different strategies of <b>endoparasites</b> and ectoparasites they require different adaptations in order to acquire nutrients from their host.|$|R
50|$|Some <b>endoparasites</b> infect {{their host}} by {{penetrating}} its external surface, while others must be ingested. Once inside the host, adult <b>endoparasites</b> need to shed offspring into {{the external environment}} to infect other hosts. Many adult <b>endoparasites</b> reside in the host’s gastrointestinal tract, where offspring can be shed along with host excreta. Adult stages of tapeworms, thorny-headed worms and most flukes use this method.|$|R
25|$|A common <b>endoparasite</b> of R. romandi are insects of {{the order}} Strepsiperans, {{commonly}} in the family Stylopidae. Strepsipteran females are permanent endoparasites that dissolve through the cuticle of the host as larvae, create a sac from the host tissue {{to protect themselves from}} host's defenses, and then reside in the abdomen of the host, occupying up to 80% of the volume of the abdomen. These parasites can cause sterility, sometimes causing ovaries and spermathecae to become unrecognizable, and often change the host morphology and behavior. However, they do not kill their host, and it has even been suggested that they can prolong their host's life. R. romandi often has multiple stylopisation, meaning they carry more than one Stylopid <b>endoparasite</b> at a time.|$|E
25|$|Several {{nematode}} species infect rice crops, causing {{diseases such}} as Ufra (Ditylenchus dipsaci), White tip disease (Aphelenchoide bessei), and root knot disease (Meloidogyne graminicola). Some nematode species such as Pratylenchus spp. are most dangerous in upland rice of {{all parts of the}} world. Rice root nematode (Hirschmanniella oryzae) is a migratory <b>endoparasite</b> which on higher inoculum levels will lead to complete destruction of a rice crop. Beyond being obligate parasites, they also decrease the vigor of plants and increase the plants' susceptibility to other pests and diseases.|$|E
25|$|The female lays {{her eggs}} {{as close to}} the food source as possible, and {{development}} is very rapid, allowing the larva to consume as much food as possible {{in a short period of}} time before transforming into the adult. The eggs hatch immediately after being laid, or the flies are ovoviviparous, with the larva hatching inside the mother. Larval flies, or maggots, have no true legs, and little demarcation between the thorax and abdomen; in the more derived species, the head is not clearly distinguishable from the rest of the body. Maggots are limbless, or else have small prolegs. The eyes and antennae are reduced or absent, and the abdomen also lacks appendages such as cerci. This lack of features is an adaptation to a food-rich environment, such as within rotting organic matter, or as an <b>endoparasite.</b> The pupae take various forms, and in some cases develop inside a silk cocoon. After emerging from the pupa, the adult fly rarely lives more than a few days, and serves mainly to reproduce and to disperse in search of new food sources.|$|E
25|$|Those {{that live}} inside the host, {{including}} all parasitic worms (helminths), are called <b>endoparasites.</b> <b>Endoparasites</b> can exist {{in one of}} two forms: intercellular parasites (inhabiting spaces in the host's body) or intracellular parasites (inhabiting cells in the host's body). Coinfection by multiple parasites is common.|$|R

50|$|Another {{important}} {{adaptation of}} <b>endoparasites</b> is the gut, which digests host macromolecules into soluble utilisable products. This feature {{is particularly important}} in <b>endoparasites</b> which are not located in the alimentary canal and therefore the supply of nutrients is not pre-digested by the host. The gut lining typically has a layer of endodermal cells which secrete proteolytic enzymes to aid digestion. Some <b>endoparasites</b> have both a gut and anus, some lack an anus and some have neither i.e. those residing in the alimentary canal which instead diffuse pre-digested host nutrients across their body surface.|$|R
50|$|Larval {{stages of}} <b>endoparasites</b> often infect {{sites in the}} host other than the blood or {{gastrointestinal}} tract. In many such cases, larval <b>endoparasites</b> require their host to be consumed by the next host in the parasite’s life cycle {{in order to survive}} and reproduce. Alternatively, larval <b>endoparasites</b> may shed free-living transmission stages that migrate through the host’s tissue into the external environment, where they actively search for or await ingestion by other hosts. The foregoing strategies are used, variously, by larval stages of tapeworms, thorny-headed worms, flukes and parasitic roundworms.|$|R

50|$|<b>Endoparasites</b> are parasites which live {{inside the}} body of the host. This group {{includes}} helminths, trematodes and cestodes. <b>Endoparasites</b> are two groups of parasites: intercellular and intracellular parasites. Intercellular parasites live in spaces within the host e.g. the alimentary canal, whereas intracellular parasites live in cells within the host e.g. erythrocytes. Intracellular parasites typically rely on a third organism, a vector, to transmit the parasite between hosts. Rather than requiring adaptations to penetrate the host, as ectoparasites do, <b>endoparasites</b> are in a nutrient-rich location so they instead have adaptations to maximise nutrient absorption. <b>Endoparasites</b> have a readily available and renewable supply of nutrients inside the host, which in some cases is pre-digested by the host, so mechanisms of nutrient absorption across their body surface is a common feature. As part of their life cycle strategy, <b>endoparasites</b> must also be able to transmit from within the host body and survive the hostile environment within the host. Only by achieving this can they benefit from acquiring nutrition in this way.|$|R
40|$|Incidence of <b>endoparasites</b> was {{investigated}} in 100 and 157 youngstock of Holstein-Friesian and Jersey breeds, respectively. Youngstock attaining the age of 9 months or more maintained at the Livestock Experiment Station, Bhunikey (Pattoki), District Kasur were selected for the present study. Faecal samples of all the selected animals were collected per rectum aseptically on quarterly basis from 1 st July 2003 to 30 th June 2004. These faecal samples were processed and examined using the standard methods i. e. direct faecal smear method, sedimentation method and floatation technique. Overall incidence of <b>endoparasites</b> in youngstock of Holstein-Friesian and Jersey breeds was 39. 00 and 38. 21 per cent, respectively. The highest incidence in Friesian and Jersey youngstock was 50 and 60 per cent during 3 rd and 4 th quarters, respectively, while the lowest incidence was 21. 05 and 17. 07 per cent, respectively during 2 nd quarter. In 1 st quarter the infestation of <b>endoparasites</b> was 34. 61 and 19. 44 per cent in Holstein Friesian and Jersey calves, respectively. It was higher than infestation of <b>endoparasites</b> observed in 2 nd quarter. The incidence of <b>endoparasites</b> in 3 rd quarter was higher than incidence observed in 1 st and 2 nd quarters.
