40|$|Cropping and {{cultivation}} under {{warm and}} moist conditions {{leads to a}} rapid depletion of the organic matter in the soil. In the cropping-areas of Canterbury the depletion of organic matter is of major importance, often responsible for the poor <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>pastures</b> and the low carrying-capacity of {{them as well as}} low yields of crops. Nitrogen is made available in the soil for grass-growth from at least two important sources : (a) the organic matter-this does not increase the nitrogen-content of the soil unless it be from leguminous crops; and (b) direct from growing legumes. The available nitrogen encourages vigorous grass-growth, and this when fed off adds to the organic matter in the soil, and the fertility of the soil is built up. Calculations of the amount of nitrogen added to the soil by clovers in pastures have been made, and the amount varies with the clover and the soil conditions. There is naturally a limit to the improvement that can be made in the fertility by these means, but on some of the cropping lands of Canterbury that limit is worth aiming at.

The main area of land-use conversion to pasture {{is to the}} north of Lake Taupo in the Central North Island (Figures 1 and 2). Pinus radiata (radiata pine) plantations were established in the late 1920 s-early 1930 s because the Vitrands (Pumice Soils) predominant in the Central North Island were deficient in Co and other trace elements, causing a fatal stock disease in sheep and cattle known as ‘bush sickness’. Bush sickness was subsequently rectified in the mid- 1930 s with the regular addition of Co, so pastoral farming became viable.

However, only a few have also looked at the temporal and spatial dynamics by which those drivers act, which is critical for assessing the conservation of biodiversity as well as for landscape planning. In this study, we analyse land cover change between 2000 and 2009 in north-western Colombian Amazonia to identify the interactions between the use of fire, cultivation of illicit crops and <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>pastures,</b> and their impacts on the loss of forest in the region. Yearly analyses were undertaken at randomly selected sample areas to quantify the average areas of transition of land cover types under different landscape compositions: forest-dominated mosaics, pasture mosaics, fire mosaics, and illicit crop mosaics. Our results indicate that despite the fact that forest areas were well-preserved, deforestation occurred at a low annual rate (0. 06 %). Conversion to pasture was the main factor responsible for forest loss (the area of pastures tripled within forest mosaics over 8 years), and this process was independent of the landscape matrix in which the forests were located. In fire mosaics, burning is a common tool for forest clearing and conversion to pasture. Thus, forests in fire mosaics were highly disturbed and frequently transformed from primary to secondary forests. The use of fire for illicit cropping was not detected, partly due to the small size of common illicit crops. Forest regeneration from pastures and secondary vegetation was observed in areas with large amounts of natural forest. Overall, assuming the continuation of the observed pastur...|$|E

Here we present the first multi-proxy palaeoecological study from the treeline in the Northwestern Swiss Alps that covers the entire Holocene. We reconstructed climate, fire and vegetation dynamics at Iffigsee, an alpine lake at 2, 065 m a. s. l., by using seismic sedimentary surveys, loss on ignition, visible spectrum reflectance spectroscopy, pollen, spore, macrofossil and charcoal analyses. Afforestation with Larix decidua and tree Betula (probably B. pendula) started at ~ 9, 800 cal. b. p., more than 1, 000 years later than at similar elevations in the Central and Southern Alps, indicating cooler temperatures and/or a high seasonality. Highest biomass production and forest position of ~ 2, 100 – 2, 300 m a. s. l. are inferred during the Holocene Thermal Maximum from 7, 000 to 5, 000 cal. b. p. With the onset of pastoralism and transhumance at 6, 800 – 6, 500 cal. b. p., human impact became {{an important factor in}} the vegetation dynamics at Iffigsee.

40|$|The {{investment}} {{potential of}} warm-season grasses is {{compared with that}} of cool-season grasses, with special emphasis on hill-land beef production. In addition to evaluating relative costs and returns for various grazing systems, a sensitivityy analysis is conducted. The results are then illustrated for a representative hill-land farm in West Virginia, and both an optimal and a set of quasi-optimal solutions are generated within the linear programming framework. In general, warm-season grasses are found to be a superior investment alternative for hill-land beef producers. In most temperate regions, native cool-season grasses (CSG) such as Kentucky Bluegrass, comprise the major source of summer feeding for beef cattle. Cattlemen and researchers have observed, however, that CSG become essentially dormant by mid-sum-mer. As an option, scientists have recommended the introduction of warm-season grasses (WSG) such as Switchgrass, Big Bluestem, and Caucasian Bluestem, which are tropical in origin and achieve their maximum growth potential in mid-summer (Kruger and Curtis). Besides their characteristic seasonal pattern of growth, WSG can grow in soils with relatively low fertility levels, or on marginal hill lands. These conditions are common in, among other areas, the state of West Virginia—the study area. While the technical feasibility of incorporating WSG into beef grazing systems for West Virginia has been established (Reid and Jung), the economic impacts associated with this approach are un-known. This analysis provides such information by evaluating and comparing the costs and returns as-sociated with selected grazing systems incorporat-ing various species of CSG, WSG, and native grasses, The main objective is, therefore, to de-termine whether the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>pastures</b> com-prising WSG is a feasible investment alternative The authors, listed in order of contribution, are respectively, an Assistan...|$|E

40|$|Leaf {{emergence}} and elongation and {{the structure}} they confer to the forage canopy are quantified based on morphogenetic and structural characteristics of the canopy. The emergence and balance of tillers is known as tillering. Both morphogenesis and tillering confer the production potential to the pasture. This process {{is influenced by the}} intensity and frequency <b>of</b> defoliation. <b>Pastures</b> exhibit phenotypic plasticity when submitted to intense and frequent grazing in order to adapt to this adverse environmental condition. Furthermore, factors such as plant age and fertilization influence the growth pattern. A population with a young age profile or a fertilized pasture has more accelerated rates of morphogenesis and requires adjustment in pasture management. In addition to these factors, the seasonal distribution pattern of rain, temperature and photoperiod leads to variations in the growth pattern <b>of</b> <b>pastures</b> over the year. When these conditions are favorable for plant growth, the rates of morphogenesis are accelerated and adjustments in management are necessary. Thus, pasture management differs between the rainy and dry seasons, mainly because of the different growth patterns during these periods. Indeed, several factors influence the growth <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> plants; however, appropriate maintenance of the leaf area index (LAI) <b>of</b> the <b>pasture</b> under continuous or intermittent stocking provides satisfactory results of pasture-based farming systems. Given the above, management targets considering morphogenetic parameters of the plant, in conjunction with the maintenance of an adequate LAI, show that continuously stocked pastures should be kept under optimal conditions for both plant growth and animal consumption. These conditions coincide with the maintenance heights of the forage canopy recommended for each species or cultivar. Similarly, under intermittent stocking, the optimal condition for pasture management, i. e., when regrowth should be interrupted, coincides with the time when the forage canopy intercepts 95 % of incident light and the average rate <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> accumulation is maximum. Thus, knowledge of the morphogenetic and structural responses of forage plants to changes in environmental conditions contributes to the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> management strategies for the efficient use of forage resources...|$|R

We compared the contents of Total C, Oxidizable C and Non-Oxidizable (stable) C in four different land use systems, namely Monoculture (Brachiaria grassland), Association (Brachiaria + Arachis pintoi), Forage Bank (a mixture of forage tree species), and Natural Regeneration of the pasture in both a flat area and a sloping one. The Degraded Pasture was the reference. Results showed that in the sloping area all treatments have higher Total Carbon stocks than the Degraded Pasture, while three of the treatments significantly increased the stocks of Non-Oxidizable C. In the flat landscape, only the Association significantly increased Total C stocks. Plowing and fertilization cause significant increases in Oxidizable carbon and decreases in Non-Oxidizable carbon. This effect needs further research, as C stability will influence equilibrium stocks. In the sloping area, improved pastures and fodder bank rapidly increased Total Carbon contents and stocks, with increases as large as 10 ton. ha- 1 yr- 1. In the Traditional Fodder Bank, which showed the largest increase, this is partially due to the application of organic manure. Surprisingly, also C stocks under Natural Regeneration were significantly higher than under the original Degraded Grassland.

We have reviewed the knowledge about changes in SOC stocks in Amazonia after the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> or cropland, sought relationships between observed changes and soil, climatic variables and management practices, and synthesized the ? 13 C measured in pastures. Our dataset consisted of 21 studies mostly synchronic, across 52 sites (Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, Suriname), totalling 70 forest?agroecosystem comparisons. We found that pastures (n = 52, mean age = 17. 6 years) had slightly higher SOC stocks than forest (+ 6. 8 ± 3. 1 %), whereas croplands (n = 18, mean age = 8. 7 years) had lower SOC stocks than forest (? 8. 5 ± 2. 9 %). Annual precipitation and SOC stocks under forest had no effect on the SOC changes in the agroecosystems. For croplands, we found a lower SOC loss than other meta-analyses, but the short time period after deforestation here could have reduced this loss. There was no clear effect of tillage on the SOC response. Management <b>of</b> <b>pastures,</b> whether they were degraded/nominal/improved, had no significant effect on SOC response. ? 13 C measurements on 16 pasture chronosequences showed that decay of forest-derived SOC was variable, whereas pasture-derived SOC was less so and was characterized by an accumulation plateau of 20 Mg SOC ha? 1 after 20 years. The large uncertainties in SOC response observed could be derived from the chronosequence approach, sensitive to natural soil variability and to human management practices.

Our dataset consisted of 21 studies mostly synchronic, across 52 sites (Brazil, Colombia, French Guiana, Suriname), totalling 70 forest-agroecosystem comparisons. We found that pastures (n= 52, mean age = 17. 6 years) had slightly higher SOC stocks than forest (+ 6. 8 +/- 3. 1 %), whereas croplands (n= 18, mean age = 8. 7 years) had lower SOC stocks than forest (- 8. 5 +/- 2. 9 %). Annual precipitation and SOC stocks under forest had no effect on the SOC changes in the agroecosystems. For croplands, we found a lower SOC loss than other meta-analyses, but the short time period after deforestation here could have reduced this loss. There was no clear effect of tillage on the SOC response. Management <b>of</b> <b>pastures,</b> whether they were degraded/nominal/improved, had no significant effect on SOC response. C- 13 measurements on 16 pasture chronosequences showed that decay of forest-derived SOC was variable, whereas pasture-derived SOC was less so and was characterized by an accumulation plateau of 20 Mg SOC ha(- 1) after 20 years. The large uncertainties in SOC response observed could be derived from the chronosequence approach, sensitive to natural soil variability and to human management practices. This study emphasizes the need for diachronic and long-term studies, associated with better knowledge of agroecosystem management...|$|R
40|$|The general {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate (i) the specificity of the spatial and temporal dynamics of apparent soil electrical conductivity (ECa) measured by a electromagnetic induction (EMI) sensor, over 7 years, in variable conditions (of soil moisture content (SMC), soil vegetation cover and grazing management) and, consequently, (ii) the potential for implementing site-specific management (SSM). The DUALEM 1 S sensor was used to measure the ECa in a 6 ha pasture experimental field four times between June 2007 and February of 2013. Soil spatial variability was characterized by 76 samples, geo-referenced with the global positioning system (GPS). The soil was characterized in terms of texture, moisture content, pH, organic matter content, nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium. This study shows a significant temporal stability of the ECa patterns under several conditions, behavior that is an excellent indicator of reliability of this tool to survey spatial soil variability and to delineate potential site-specific management zones (SSMZ). Significant correlations were obtained in this work between the ECa and relative field elevation, pH, silt and soil moisture content. These results open perspectives for using the EMI sensor as an indicator of SMC in irrigation management and of needs of limestone correction in Mediterranean pastures. However, it is interesting to extend the findings to other types of soil to verify the origin of the lack of correlation between the ECa data measured by DUALEM sensor and properties such as the clay, organic matter or phosphorus soil content, fundamental parameters for <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> SSM projects...|$|R

40|$|Mining at Boddington in {{the eastern}} jarrah forest of {{south-west}} Western Australia by Boddington Gold Mine and Hedges Gold produces 10 million tonnes of residue annual. This is stored in purpose built dams that will eventually cover 1000 ha. The residue has to support a variety <b>of</b> ecosystems from <b>pasture</b> to native vegetation. As {{this was the first}} gold mining operation in the south west of Western Australia, and the problems faced in vegetating the residue were unknown, the present field trial was aimed at selecting species suitable for revegetation. The experiments were conducted in a purpose built one hectare dam with a residue depth of about 1. 5 metres. The salinity, sodicity and alkalinity of the residue were ameliorated by using a land preparation procedure selected from previous experiments: ripping, rotary hoeing, amending with gypsum (30 and 60 t/ha), mulching with organic matter (poultry manure) and covering with topsoil. The 27 species of trees, shrubs, herbs, legumes, grasses and sedges tested were {{selected on the basis of}} their ability to tolerate salt-affected seasonally waterlogged clay soil. They were planted in spring 1992 and screened for their survival during the following 12 months. Survival of native species varied. For example, two of the local jarrah forest Eucalyptus species, E. marginata and E. patens, did not survive past the second month of summer. By contrast, salt tolerant species Atriplex amnicola, Casuarina glauca and Casuarinaobhesa survived and in some cases flourished. The grasses sown all germinated, grew and produced seed and some germinated the following season. It was concluded that <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> <b>pasture</b> or crops, and of non-endemic native vegetation on the amended residue is feasible but re-establishment of jarrah forest requires more investigation...|$|R

The <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> temporary <b>pastures</b> in Cluj County is a viable technological alternative. The research results presented in this paper show the evolution of floristic composition of complex mixtures of 8 perennial grasses and legumes, fertilized on three levels (0 N 0 P 2 O 5; 60 N 70 P 2 O 5; 120 N 70 P 2 O 5 kg ha- 1) in the environmental conditions at Jucu, a representative pratoecosistem in Someşelor Plateau.

40|$|Despite high {{deforestation}} {{rates in}} dry forests {{there are few}} assessments of the impacts of this transformation on biodiversity. This study addresses the impact of clearing on plant species composition and diversity in mulga (Acacia aneura) forests of Queensland, Australia using data collected from either side of 58 clearing boundaries, incorporating data on site and management conditions. The physical and climatic conditions of the study sites were narrowly constrained but had greater influence on plant composition and richness than clearing per se. In general, the abundance of perennial forbs and shrubs was higher in cleared forest compared with adjacent intact forest {{and there was no}} significant difference in abundance of other plant life forms. Perennial forb richness diminished with the age of clearings, particularly where acid sub-soils had been exposed and shrubs proliferated. Where deforestation in the mulga dry forests is not accompanied by the <b>establishment</b> <b>of</b> exotic <b>pasture</b> it has a relatively benign effect on plant diversity, mulga itself remains in high density as small trees and the integrity of the forest could be maintained with restoration...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Annual crops {{have been}} {{frequently}} {{used for the}} <b>establishment</b> and renewing <b>of</b> <b>pastures</b> in the Brazilian Cerrado. However it was only recently that cropping and cattle production have been treated as integrated systems' components. In this context, the publication shows how system concepts and its implementation through mathematical modeling {{can be used in}} the management of integrated crop-livestock production systems. Further, it is concluded that the increasing access to computers is creating great opportunities to store and spread out information to better support decision-making. It is concluded, however, that the development of computer models for integrated systems is still incipient and that closer collaboration among researchers of different areas of expertise, mathematicians and software developers is necessary for accelerating and improving the quality decision-support tools for farmers. 200...|$|R
