5|$|In {{late summer}} of 1777, British General John Burgoyne led a major {{invasion}} army south from Quebec, {{with the intention}} of splitting off rebellious New England. But General Howe in New York took his army south to Philadelphia instead of <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Hudson River to join with Burgoyne near Albany—a major strategic mistake. Meanwhile, Washington rushed to Philadelphia to engage Howe, while closely following the action in upstate New York, where the patriots were led by General Philip Schuyler and his successor Horatio Gates. The ensuing pitched battles at Philadelphia were too complex for Washington's relatively inexperienced men and they were defeated.|$|E
5|$|As {{the race}} reached the lower slopes of Ventoux, Simpsons's team {{mechanic}} Harry Hall, witnessed Simpson, still ill, putting the lid {{back on his}} water bottle as he exited a building. Race commissaire (official), Jacques Lohmuller, later confirmed to Hall that he also saw the incident and that Simpson was putting brandy in his bottle. As the race closed in on the summit of Ventoux, the peloton began to fracture, and for a while, Simpson managed {{to stay in the}} front group of elite riders. He then slipped back to a group of chasers around one minute behind before he began to lose control of his bike and zig-zag across the road. His team manager, Alec Taylor, feared for Simpson less for the way he was <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> mountain than for the way he would go down the other side.|$|E
50|$|The fare {{control area}} {{at the north end}} of the station is unstaffed, {{containing}} just full height turnstiles, one staircase <b>going</b> <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> northeast corner of 203rd Street and Grand Concourse, and another staircase <b>going</b> <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> west side of Grand Concourse near this intersection.|$|R

5|$|Following several stages won by sprinters and {{breakaway}}s, {{the next}} {{test for the}} riders was the legendary Alto de El Angliru in Stage 13. The morning breakaway was afforded over eleven minutes, but it was dropped to nothing on the ascent {{of what has been}} called the most difficult climb in all of professional cycling. Astana and Caisse d'Epargne both had many support riders in the leading group <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> climb, and they alternately tried to set paces to protect either Contador or Alejandro Valverde while isolating the competition. It was left to Leipheimer to pace Contador to the conclusion as the climb reached its hardest part, 7 kilometers from the finish. Contador indeed {{went on to win the}} stage, and took the race lead as well. Contador added another stage win the next day when only he and Leipheimer could respond to the repeated attacks of Ezequiel Mosquera, and Contador won the sprint.|$|E
5|$|It {{begins with}} a shot of Wade's face and the guitar introduction. He then sings {{the first line of}} lyrics, which is {{followed}} by a transition to a boy lying on a bed shirtless. As the video switches between Wade and the boy, it zooms on the bed frame (which has the same face from the album cover) and opens into another area. The boy is then seen walking around the new area looking around until he goes up nearby stairs. While <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stairs, the video switches between shots of the boy <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stairs and Wade singing the lyrics. Once up the stairs, the boy looks around and then walks into a bright light that he sees nearby. He walks through the bright archway into a dark room as the video switches to Lifehouse playing the song. After this, it switches to the boy as he looks up and the camera zooms out to reveal that he is in a giant maze. He then walks back where he came from to find that he is in a house with Lifehouse playing on the television. He then jumps off a window sill and appears tiny as he walks up to a book that is bigger than him. It then transitions to Lifehouse playing the song as the boy gets up on a chair which slowly transcends into his original bed. The video then zooms out on the boy lying on his bed and then switches to the band. It ends with the boy walking into darkness and Wade's face looking on the floor.|$|E
5|$|Sometime later, Bud confronts Gekko in Central Park. Gekko {{physically}} assaults Bud as he berates him for {{his role}} with Bluestar and accuses him of ingratitude for several of their illicit trades. Following the confrontation, it is revealed that Bud has turned state's evidence and was wearing a wire to record his encounter with Gekko. He turns the wire tapes over to the authorities, who suggest that he may get a lighter sentence in exchange for helping them make a case against Gekko. Later on, Bud's parents drive him down FDR Drive towards the New York State Supreme Court Building downtown to answer for the crimes he committed under Gekko's influence. Carl tells him he did right in saving the airline. The film ends with Bud <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> steps of the courthouse, knowing that while he is likely going to prison and his career is ruined, he now has a clear conscience.|$|E
50|$|Both {{platforms}} have an unstaffed platform-level fare {{control at}} their north end, with no crossover. On the Church Avenue-bound side, one exit-only turnstile and one High Entry/Exit Turnstile {{lead to a}} single staircase <b>going</b> <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> northwest corner of Norman and Manhattan Avenues. On the Queens-bound side, a single full height turnstile leads to a staircase <b>going</b> <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> northeast corner of the same intersection.|$|R
50|$|The station's {{main house}} is located {{underneath}} the right-of-way {{on the south}} side of Avenue J and has a full-time turnstile bank and token booth. There is a double-wide staircase facing north <b>going</b> <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> Coney Island-bound platform and one narrow staircase facing south <b>going</b> <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> Manhattan-bound platform. The Coney Island-bound staircase's landing has two exit-only turnstiles leading directly to the street.|$|R

5|$|The {{campaign}} was to proceed {{in conjunction with}} the effort to capture Lae. As the Japanese garrison there was pressed by the 7th Division advancing from the Markham Valley and the 9th Division advancing along the coast from beaches east of the town, the Japanese hurriedly sought to reinforce Lae, moving about 6,000 troops from Salamaua to the south. Sensing an opportunity, in early September the 3rd Division began a drive north on Salamaua from Wau. On 31 August, the battalion joined the fighting, advancing around the right flank of the US 162nd Infantry Regiment and attacking the junction between the Lokanu and Scout Ridges. Over the course of 10 days of heavy fighting and hard <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> steep slopes, it gained the position, securing it by 9 September. The battalion had lost 10 men killed and 47 wounded in the process, but had killed 107 Japanese. The following day, the 15th advanced towards Nuk Nuk as Japanese resistance crumbled. Hard-pressed, the Japanese garrison had begun to withdraw from Salamaua, completing the process just before the Allies entered the town on 11 September. The battalion's total casualties in the fighting around Salamaua between April and September numbered 11 killed and 50 wounded.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} {{staircase}} exits: two <b>going</b> <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> northeastern {{corner of the}} intersection of Grand and Chrystie Streets, and one <b>going</b> <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> northwestern corner. The station originally only had the two street stairs to the northeastern corner of the intersection, but due to growing ridership over the years—mainly by commuters from various Brooklyn neighborhoods to Manhattan's Chinatown—the third staircase to the northwestern corner was added in 1999.|$|R

25|$|As no roads {{linked the}} inland {{province}} of Mato Grosso to Rio de Janeiro, Brazilian ships needed to travel through Paraguayan territory, <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Paraguay River {{to arrive at}} Cuiabá. However, Brazil had difficulty obtaining permission from the government in Asunción to freely use the Paraguay River for its shipping needs.|$|E
25|$|The {{line has}} three passing loops, around 15 minutes {{travelling}} time apart. <b>Going</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> mountain, these are at Hebron, Halfway and Clogwyn stations. The {{operation of the}} Hebron and Halfway loops was converted to semi-automatic operation in the early 1990s. The Clogwyn loop is still staffed and retains the original mechanical point levers. Waterfall station had a siding but never a loop, and has been closed for many years.|$|E
25|$|After the war, the {{new state}} began making further use of the road. A regular stagecoach route was {{chartered}} along the road by the legislature in 1785, and the mileposts were upgraded {{by the end of}} the century. By then a regular mail route was in place, with riders <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> east side of the river and down another road on the west side on a weekly basis.|$|E

Full height turnstiles provide access to/from fare control near these three entrances/exits. The station's only token booth and bank of regular turnstiles is located between the south and center fare control areas. Evidence {{of at least two}} former booths exist.|$|R
25|$|Mungilpallam (Moongilpallam) {{village at}} , at the {{headwaters}} of the TenAr, the third village <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> valley, is a hamlet of just 20 houses of Pulaiyar people (pop: m-22, f-18), on the north side and above the Kumbaar stream. They practice some shifting cultivation on their south facing slope. There is a steep cliff trail from here which leads east to Kumboor village {{at the end of the}} road from Kodaikanal.|$|E
25|$|Organisms {{living in}} this zone have a highly {{variable}} and often hostile environment, and have evolved various adaptations to cope with and even exploit these conditions. One easily visible feature of intertidal communities is vertical zonation, where the community is divided into distinct vertical bands of specific species <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> shore. Species {{ability to cope with}} abiotic factors associated with emersion stress, such as desiccation determines their upper limits, while biotic interactions e.g.competition with other species sets their lower limits.|$|E
25|$|The {{second of}} these is valid in the cut complex plane. There are two cuts, from i to the point at infinity, going down the {{imaginary}} axis, and from i to the point at infinity, <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> same axis. It works best for real numbers running from −1 to 1. The partial denominators are the odd natural numbers, and the partial numerators (after the first) are just (nz)2, with each perfect square appearing once. The first was developed by Leonhard Euler; the second by Carl Friedrich Gauss utilizing the Gaussian hypergeometric series.|$|E

25|$|White {{factoring}} {{affects the}} amount of white on the dog. It is hard to tell, without actually breeding, whether a dog is white-factored or not, though dogs with white <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stifle (the front of the hind leg) are usually assumed to be white-factored. Breeding two white-factored dogs can result in color-headed whites—Shelties with colored heads (sable, tricolor, bi-black, or blue or sable merle) and white bodies. For show dogs, dogs with more than 50% white are heavily penalized and thus are not shown in the breed ring; they are normal in every other way.|$|E
25|$|Wood burning: when wood is burned, it {{is usually}} best to dry it first. Damage from {{shrinkage}} {{is not a problem}} here, and the drying may proceed more rapidly than in the case of drying for woodworking purposes. Moisture affects the burning process, with unburnt hydrocarbons <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> chimney. If a 50% wet log is burnt at high temperature, with good heat extraction from the exhaust gas leading to a 100°C exhaust temperature, about 5% of the energy of the log is wasted through evaporating and heating the water vapour. With condensers, the efficiency can be further increased; but, for the normal stove, the key to burning wet wood is to burn it very hot, perhaps starting fire with dry wood.|$|E
25|$|Surmounted on {{the main}} altar is a {{beautiful}} statue of St. Lucy holding up {{her eyes on the}} palm of her hand. The exquisite stained glass windows when lit by sunlight create a panorama of colour further enhancing the transepts of the church. In a far corner of the church is a circular Baptismal Font of white marble carved with cherubs, and crowned by a statue of John the Baptist. On <b>going</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> narrow staircase that leads to the choir loft, one encounters 'Anthony Thomas', an enormous bell weighing 4300lbs. The bell has intricate engravings of elaborate floral wreaths and holy figures and symbols of Christianity, and it is the largest of the four bells shipped from Marseilles and christened at the cathedral in 1903. The choir loft also contains a unique pipe organ donated to the cathedral in 1934.|$|E
