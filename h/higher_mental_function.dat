40|$|The author {{presents}} his own {{model of}} reading and writing ability development based on Lev S. Vygotsky’s cultural-historical theory. The process of learning {{to read and write}} is regarded as a process of forming a new <b>higher</b> <b>mental</b> <b>function.</b> The function, termed “written speech”, is the effect of building a relation between speech sounds and graphic signs of writing and meaning. Written speech is created during a complicated and long-term developmental process. Just as the structure of every <b>higher</b> <b>mental</b> <b>function,</b> psychological function organization activated during reading and writing (the written speech structure) is changed during its maturation. Observed quality changes of written speech structure are the basis for identifying four specific stages in written speech development: (1) the natural stage, (2) the “naive” stage, (3) the outer stage, and (4) the inner stage. The paper also presents the process of written speech development in the context of human psychological system development. From this perspective, written speech is always dominated by a central mental function, such as perception, memory or thinking...|$|E

This theory facilitates reflection on some of the problems on second language acquisition from a new perspective.

40|$|This work is {{dedicated}} to the development of L. S. Vygotsky’s ideas in clinical psychology and the clarification of some basic points of the cultural-historical concept. The paper presents a thesis about the development of man in ontogeny as the result of his interaction with the cultural environment, which transforms natural <b>mental</b> <b>functions</b> into <b>higher</b> <b>mental</b> <b>functions.</b> This process can be attended by a whole range of psychopathologies. The issues discussed include voluntary regulation of <b>higher</b> <b>mental</b> <b>functions,</b> determination of the involuntariness and “post-voluntariness” of functions, the internalization of actions, the differentiation of affect and emotion (including as <b>higher</b> <b>mental</b> <b>functions),</b> the “cultural” socialization of non-mental functions (sex, sleep, excretion), and the discord between natural and “cultural” entities in a person. The basis for the ontological development of man is the genesis of “subjectness”, like all the forms of higher activity that emerge when encountering cultural restrictions and requirements causing specific mental disorders. The supposition is made that there are no significant restrictions to explaining either <b>mental</b> or non-mental <b>functions</b> with the cultural-historical approach.

40|$|From {{birth to}} death, neurons are {{actively}} and dynamically accompanied by neuroglial cells {{in a very}} close morphological and functional relationship. The results of their study {{in the last years}} revolutionized the concepts about the functionality of the CNS.
