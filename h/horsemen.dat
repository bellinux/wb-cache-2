5|$|The {{relationship}} between the Dungeon of Doom and the Four <b>Horsemen</b> broke down {{as a result of}} Kevin Sullivan's feud with <b>Horsemen</b> member Chris Benoit. As a result, the Faces of Fear were booked to face Benoit and Steve McMichael, another member of the Four <b>Horsemen,</b> at Halloween Havoc 1996. Benoit pinned Meng to win the match for the <b>Horsemen</b> team. The Barbarian and Meng's next major appearance was at Starrcade 1996, when they faced Scott Hall and Kevin Nash, who were members of another rival heel stable known as the New World Order. Hall and Nash's WCW World Tag Team Championship was on the line, but the Faces of Fear were unable to win the belts, as Nash pinned The Barbarian.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as the legions {{underwent}} these transformations, the auxilia were reorganized and a number of allied troops were formalised into standing units similar to legions. Rather than being raised re-actively when required, the process of raising auxiliary troops was carried out in advance of conflicts according to annual targets. Whereas the internal organisation of the auxilia had previously been left up to their commanders, in the early empire they were organised into standardised units known as turmae (for cavalry alae) and centuriae (for infantry cohortes). Although never becoming as standardised in their equipment as the legions, and often retaining some national flavour, the size of the units at least was standardised to some degree. Cavalry were formed into either an ala quingenaria of 512 <b>horsemen,</b> or an ala millaria of 1,000 <b>horsemen.</b> Likewise, infantry auxilia could be formed into a cohors quingenaria of 500 men or a cohors millaria of 1,000 men. Mixed cavalry/infantry auxiliaries were typically formed with a larger proportion of foot than horse troops: the cohors equitata quingenaria consisted of 380 foot and 120 <b>horsemen,</b> and the cohors equitata millaria consisted of 760 foot and 240 <b>horsemen.</b>|$|E
