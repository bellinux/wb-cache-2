The Krieger-Dougherty (KH) model indicated high interparticle interaction factors, and maximum packing factors of similar to 1 suggested polydispersity.

This work evaluated {{the effect of}} the nanoparticles of SiO 2 in the separation efficiency based on deasphalted oil (DAO) fraction quality compared to the conventional process of <b>deasphalting</b> (SDA). Different effects have been assessed such as solvent to oil ratio, operating temperatures, type of solvent, and SiO 2 nanoparticles dosage. The DAO quality was based on the asphaltene and sulfur contents, API gravity, distillable fraction, and rheological properties. The improvement of the process from the use of nanoparticles was confirmed with important reductions in the asphaltene and sulfur contents in the DAO of up to 24 % and 23 %, respectively, in comparison with the SDA process. Also, the API gravity can be increased by approximately 14 % with the e-SDA process. The rheological properties of the DAO were improved by the inclusion of nanoparticles showing reductions in the viscosities of the DAO greater than 50 % in comparison with the conventional process.

30|$|Furthermore, {{among many}} {{components}} of bitumen, the asphaltene {{have been identified}} as the key in the crude oil viscosity. Challenges due to asphaltene deposition in production, transportation, and refining operations are considered as serious and complicated issues for the petroleum industry that applies a significant effort worldwide into prevention and remediation. Furthermore, several studies have shown that bitumen viscosity is strongly dependent on the volume fraction, chemical structures, and physico-chemical properties of its asphaltenes content, which are the most polar and/or heavy components in bitumen [14, 19]. Mack [13] observed the effect of asphaltene content on viscosity of bitumen and reported that the viscosity of reconstituted bitumen with 20  % of asphaltene was 367 times higher than that of the <b>deasphalted</b> bitumen (i.e., maltenes) at the room temperature.

Further, a study by Chakma and Berruti [5] reported that viscosity depends not only on asphaltene content but also on the molecular weight of the asphaltene and higher molecular weight asphaltene units have greater tendencies to form aggregates of larger sizes and therefore, provide greater resistance to flow.|$|R

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that the {{industrial}} nature of the raw material has some implications for its properties, particularly on the asphaltene content. Traditionally, in solvent <b>deasphalting</b> processes the feed and the solvent are mixed together, in ratios varying from 3 : 1 up to 10 : 1 [10], leading to the precipitation and separation of the asphaltene fraction. Neither the solvent to feed ratio, nor the settling time allowed for phase separation is near that of the laboratory precipitation procedure. Although, the efficiency of <b>deasphalting</b> in such cases may differ, it has been reported to being up to 80  % efficient compared to rigorous laboratory precipitation [10]. As a consequence, the material present in the separated asphaltene fraction is not only asphaltenes. In fact, the term asphaltenes being a solubility class has a relative meaning and it should not be taken on an absolute basis, as one can do with a compound class. The industrially obtained raw material has an actual asphaltene content of ~ 70  wt %. This content was measured according to standard laboratory techniques in which the solvent to feed ratio (40 : 1) exceeds by far the industrial conditions.

40|$|RATIONALE Characterization {{of crude}} oil {{represents}} a challenge for researchers due to its complexity. While Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) is the method of choice for such complex matrices {{the high number of}} ions present limits the efficiency of the analysis due to charge competition and space charge effects. One way to solve this problem is the direct coupling of FT-ICR MS with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). METHODS Normal-phase liquid chromatography was applied on a <b>deasphalted</b> crude oil sample by using a polar aminocyano-bonded stationary phase with n-hexane and isopropyl alcohol as a mobile phase. The HPLC system was coupled online to a 12 [*]T ultrahigh-resolution FT-ICR mass spectrometer. Ion chromatograms were obtained with electrospray ionization (ESI), atmospheric pressure photoionization (APPI), atmospheric pressure chemical ionization (APCI), and atmospheric pressure laser ionization (APLI). RESULTS The chromatographic separation yielded a group separation into two peaks according to the polarity of the components. Each ionization technique was able to uniquely assign components differing in polarity and aromaticity. Additionally, an increase in aromaticity in the course of retention time for nonpolar species in the first peak was observed. Monitoring the ratio between protonated and radical mono-nitrogen species was achieved. CONCLUSIONS For the analysis of a crude oil sample, online coupling of a normal-phase HPLC system to an FT-ICR mass spectrometer was achieved.

40|$|The high {{complexity}} {{of crude oil}} makes the use of chromatographic separation an important tool especially for sample simplification. The coupling of normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a polar aminocyano column to a Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FTICR) mass spectrometer offers the best attributes of good separation prior to ultrahigh resolution mass spectrometry (MS) detection. Atmospheric pressure laser ionization (APLI) {{was used as an}} ionization technique to analyze the nitrogen-containing aromatic compounds in a <b>deasphalted</b> crude oil due to its unique selectivity toward aromatic compounds and also due to its sensitivity. Two main chromatographic peaks were observed during this separation indicating a class-based separation. Mass spectra obtained from fractions were collected along the entire retention time and compared with each other to assign the unique constituents. By coupling the HPLC system directly to the FTICR mass spectrometer, comparable ion and UV chromatograms were obtained, reflecting the scan-to-scan sensitivity of the coupling system. The results show {{that it is possible to}} calculate reconstructed class chromatograms (RCC), allowing differences in class composition to be traced along the retention time. As an example, radical and protonated nitrogen species generated by APLI were detected along the retention time which enabled a differentiation between basic and nonbasic species in the same polar peak, thus overcoming the limitation of chromatographic resolution.

Consequently phase changes and time after mixing n-heptane and heavy oil in toluene {{are important for}} understanding produced emulsions. The kinetics of phase change when n-heptane is added to toluene-diluted heavy oils, and the thermodynamic properties of partially <b>deasphalted</b> heavy oils were studied. The methods used were monitoring precipitation in time using light microscopy, quantitative asphaltenes analysis by near infrared spectroscopy, refractive index and densities measurements, and calculated solubility parameters of mixtures. At critical mass ratios of hep/tol from 1. 37 to 2. 0 in diluted heavy oil the precipitated asphaltene particles were observed under the microscope after lag times from 2 h to instantly. Lag times were longer at low initial oil concentration. The floc growth time decreased as heavy oil concentration in toluene increased. The growth patterns in time appeared as dots to beads (strings) to clusters (fractal-like flocs). Final wt% precipitated asphaltenes vs. mass fraction (hep+tol) /heavy oil followed sigmoidal relationships. Curves showing wt% soluble asphaltenes vs. mass fraction hep/tol after 24 h initially followed the same shape as time zero curves and diverged at the onset ratios of hep/tol. Slope for precipitated asphaltenes vs. solubility parameters curve showed a break at 16. 4 MPa 1 / 2. Linear correlations were established for concentrations of soluble asphaltenes in residual oils and density, for refractive index and density and for refractive index and solubility parameter. The latter correlation was in accordance with Lorenz-Lorentz theory.

In patent literature there are claims that state that this material {{can be converted}} into an aromatic petrochemical feedstock by oxidative liquefaction at low temperature. To evaluate the validity of these claims, asphaltenes from an industrial solvent <b>deasphalting</b> process were oxidized with dry and water-saturated air at temperatures in the range 45 – 100  °C. Infrared spectroscopy of the oxidized product confirmed that oxygen was incorporated as C=O and C–O. Under all experimental conditions studied little oxidative degradation was observed {{that would lead to}} the production of a petrochemical feedstock. Nevertheless, some observations of scientific value were made about the low-temperature conversion of asphaltenes. During autoxidation with dry air, the n-pentane-insoluble fraction increased. On the contrary, when oxidation was conducted with water-saturated air, the formation of additional n-pentane-insoluble material was suppressed. Mild heating of asphaltenes under nitrogen atmosphere also caused the n-pentane-insoluble content to increase. Spectroscopic evidence showed that esters are formed during oxidation at ~ 100  °C. The temperature dependence of this reaction was explained and a possible reaction pathway for cycloalkane to ester conversion was presented. Ester selectivity was determined by the competition between hydrogen abstraction and β-scission of the alkoxy radical.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} an {{increased}} use of polymers has occurred to modify asphalt binders, mainly to decrease pavement rutting but also to improve binder failure strain in direct tension. Whereas all of these effects positively impact the durability of polymermodified pavements, a need exists to quantify these improvements and the duration {{in the presence of}} oxidative aging. This research evaluated the durability of polymer modified asphalt (PMA) through a number of determinations that included the characterization of the original binder property and pavement-aged binder for modified and unmodified binders. Changes in styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS) polymer modified binder properties from oxidation were analyzed using dynamic shear rheometry, ductility, and force ductility. Previous literature reports using size exclusion chromatography showed that degradation of the molecular weight profile of SBS accompanied the loss of PMA ductility. Yet base binder embrittlement also occurred, as evidenced by ductility and force ductility. Testing aged PMA binders at higher temperatures to soften the base binder restored the polymer modulus to the force ductility measurements as did blending with a softer <b>deasphalted</b> oil. These measurements indicate that the more significant cause of PMA degradation with aging is base binder embrittlement rather than polymer degradation. Sixteen pavements in 11 Texas Districts, plus four MnRoad pavements were evaluated in order to obtain a more detailed profile of binder oxidation in pavements. Slices of each core provided detail on binder oxidation and air voids. The data confirm that binders can oxidize at least several inches into the pavement. However, oxidation also can be significantly slowed, apparently by very low accessible air voids. Interestingly, the data indicate that the air voids that are relevant to the binder at a specific depth of the pavement are those in the immediate vicinity of the binder; low air voids above or below the binder do not seem to significantly affect the binder oxidation rate. Furthermore, that binders oxidize inches below the surface shows that temperature conducts well into the pavement, consistent with a heat conduction model that is used to calculate ground temperatures as a function of depth...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{asphaltene}} precipitation from Iranian {{heavy crude oil}} (Persian Gulf off-shore) was performed using n-pentane (n-C 5) and n-heptane (n-C 7) as light alkane precipitants. Several analytical techniques, each following different principles, were then used to structurally characterize the precipitated asphaltenes. The yield of asphaltene obtained using n-pentane precipitant was higher than asphaltene precipitated {{with the use of}} n-heptane. The asphaltene removal affected the n-C 5 and n-C 7 maltene fractions at temperatures below 204 °C, as shown by the data obtained through the simulated distillation technique. Viscosity of heavy oil is influenced by the asphaltene content and behavior. The viscosity dependence of the test heavy oil on the shear rate applied was determined and the flow was low at y. above 25  s- 1. The reconstituted heavy oil samples were prepared by adding different amounts of asphaltenes to the maltenes (<b>deasphalted</b> heavy oil) and asphaltene effects were more pronounced at the low temperature of 25 °C as compared with those at the higher temperatures. According to the power law model used in this study the flowability of the test heavy oil exhibited a pseudoplastic character. Structural results obtained from Fourier Transform InfraRed (FTIR) spectroscopy showed the presence of the different functional groups in the precipitated asphaltenes. For instance, the presence of different hydrocarbons (aliphatic, aromatic and alicyclic) based on their characteristics in the FTIR spectra was confirmed. Resins are effective dispersants, and removal of this fraction from the crude oil is disturbing to the colloidal nature of heavy oil; asphaltene flocculation and precipitation eventually occur. Appearance of pores in the Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) images was used as an indicator of the resin detachment. With the use of 1 H and 13 C Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, two important structural parameters of the asphaltenes were determined. Namely, the aromaticity (fa) and the average number of carbon atoms per alkyl side chain (ncarbon), where fa for n-C 5 asphaltenes was lower (0. 39) than that obtained with n-C 7 solvent (0. 49). Additionally, the ncarbon parameter values were 7. 7 and 5. 7 for n-C 5 and n-C 7 asphaltenes, respectively.

Several experiments were performed to determine how recycling agent composition affects the high, intermediate, and low temperature properties as well as long term oxidative aging characteristics of recycled asphalt blends. Specifically, several <b>deasphalted</b> oil samples, commercial recycling agents and supercritical unit top fractions were separated into two distinct aromatic and saturate fractions. The aromatic and saturate fractions were then blended, in controlled amounts, with artificially aged SHRP asphalts. The long term oxidative aging characteristics of each blend were evaluated using the hardening susceptibility (HS) parameter, while Superpave TM Performance Grades were used to evaluate the high, intermediate and low temperature properties. The recycling agents consisting of saturate and asphaltene-free aromatic fractions improved the hardening susceptibility of recycled asphalt binder blends. Dilution of the aged asphalt along with the composition of the recycling agent were found to be key parameters in improving the hardening susceptibility of recycled asphalt blends. In addition, recycled asphalt blends made from saturate and asphaltene-free aromatic recycling agents possessed improved hardening susceptibility values over using a new asphalt binder. The high temperature Superpave TM Performance Grade (PG) specifications for recycled asphalt binders were found to be highly dependent on the aged asphalt. In addition, as the amount of saturates in the aromatic recycling agent increased, the upper and intermediate PG specifications decreased. The low temperature PG specifications deteriorated as the amount of aromatic recycling agent increased, and an opposite trend occurred when the saturate content of the recycling agent increased, thus indicating that the mere presence of saturates improve the low temperature PG of recycled asphalt blends. The performance grades of the recycled blends were all superior to the PG of the original asphalts and superior to using a new asphalt binder. The data indicate that although two completely different blends may have equivalent PG, and therefore similar performance properties, they can have vastly different HS values. In conclusion, a compromise must be made between performance grade and hardening susceptibility, since the data indicate that saturates improve the PG while deteriorating the HS...|$|R

For a more complete study of the composition and properties of oil waxes, especially as regard to their most high molecular weight paraffins, an accurate study of the asphaltenes is required.|$|E
30|$|Asphaltenes are a {{solubility}} class. Industrially it {{is produced}} as the rejection product from a solvent <b>deasphalting</b> process to produce deasphalted oil, {{which is the}} upgraded product. The asphaltenes fraction contains the heaviest and most polar compounds in crude oil, {{as well as a}} significant fraction of heteroatoms and metals. Compared to bitumen, asphaltenes are more aromatic in nature, and have an even lower H:C ratio (1.1 approximately) [1]. Even though, asphaltenes are considered the least favorable fraction for upgrading, they have the potential to be converted to higher value liquid products, including petrochemicals. Industrially, there are pathways for doing so, but more efficient alternative conversion chemistries are required to make it economically attractive.|$|E
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project {{is to develop a}} new approach for the direct liquefaction of coal to produce an all-distillate product slate at a sizable cost reduction over current technology. The approach integrates coal selection, pretreatment, coal swelling with catalyst impregnation, liquefaction, product recovery with characterization, alternate bottoms processing, and carrying out a technical assessment including an economic evaluation. The primary coal of this program, Black Thunder subbituminous coal, can be effectively beneficiated to about 3. 5 wt % ash using aqueous sulfurous acid pretreatment. This treated coal can be further beneficiated to about 2 wt % ash using commercially available procedures. All three coals used in this study (Black Thunder, Burning Star bituminous, and Martin Lake lignite) are effectively swelled by a number of solvents. The most effective solvents are those having hetero-functionality. laboratory- and bench-scale liquefaction experimentation is underway using swelled and catalyst impregnated coal samples. Higher coal conversions were observed for the SO{sub 2 }-treated subbituminous coal than the raw coal, regardless of catalyst type. Conversions of swelled coal were highest when Molyvan L, molybdenum naphthenate, and nickel octoate, respectively, were added to the liquefaction solvent. The study of bottoms processing consists of combining the ASCOT process which consists of coupling solvent <b>deasphalting</b> with delayed coking to maximize the production of coal-derived liquids while rejecting solids within the coke drum. The asphalt production phase has been completed; representative product has been evaluated. The solvent system for the <b>deasphalting</b> process has been established. Two ASCOT tests produced overall liquid yields (63. 3 wt % and 61. 5 wt %) that exceeded the combined liquid yields from the vacuum tower and ROSE process...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken to elucidate the chemical {{composition of the}} unresolved complex mixture (UCM) found in heavily biodegraded crude oils. The isolation of total hydrocarbons fraction by alumina column chromatography of the <b>deasphalted,</b> biodegraded crude oil (West Sak, from the Shublich formation, Alaska), was subjected {{to a variety of}} techniques, including chromatographic methods such as column chromatography and TLC to obtain aliphatic and aromatic sub-fractions. Molecular inclusion techniques such as urea, thiourea adduction and 13 X molecular sieving were applied to gain some general indication on the UCM component sizes and the distribution of cyclic components, which was also aided by elemental analysis. All fractions obtained by the above-mentioned methods were analysed by gas chromatography (GC) and some by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Chemical oxidative degradation using chromic acid was employed to derive more specific structural data on the various units present in the UCM. The chemical oxidation products obtained were analysed by GC and GC-MS as full methyl esters. Spectroscopic/spectrometrie techniques such as FT-IR, FT-NMR (1 H, 13 C), UV, EI-MS and CI-MS were also employed to elucidate the general chemical nature of the UCM components. It is apparent from NMR and IR studies that the UCM is mainly aliphatic (ca. 90 %) and comprises a significant proportion ofcyclic systems with probably up to four and five fused rings. In contrast, TLC resulted in a ca. 50 : 50 mixture between aliphatic and aromatic components in the UCM. An average empirical formula of C 4 H 7 was obtained from the elemental analysis implying that mixture of di- and tri-cyclic components are present in the UCM. Quantification data of the adducted UCM by urea (ca. 50 + 25 %) reflected the presence of a significant proportion of branched/cyclic systems with n-alkyl chains attached at one end. With thiourea, it was found that ca. 65 % of the UCM was confined to the thiourea adduct, suggesting that branched and/or cyclic structures with sizes up to four fused rings are important contributors to the UCM structure. Aliphatic/aromatic class fractionation with 13 X molecular sieve indicated that ca. 70 % of the UCM components are aliphatic and ca. 30 % are aromatic. Oxidation product data suggested that cyclic systems present are substituted with alkyl chains. The maximum n-alkyl chains would appear not to exceed C 20 in length and their frequency distribution seems to maximise around C 18. Molecular ion information was not obtained from EI-MS and CI-MS, although evidence was obtained to support a predominantly aliphatic mixed cyclic/acyclic composition. <p...|$|R
30|$|As can be seen, {{asphaltenes}} and waxes differ {{greatly in}} chemical properties {{from each other}} and from other oil fractions. Asphaltenes are the most aromatic and polar fraction, waxes—most aliphatic and nonpolar. However, despite these differences, these two oil fractions are similar in that they have a high molecular weight, aggregate or associate in solutions, and have a limited solubility in crude oil. The waxes and asphaltenes have a dramatic influence on the properties of crude oil and can cause problems related to crystallization and aggregation, respectively. Changes in pressure, oil composition, and temperature often induce paraffin crystallization and/or asphaltene flocculation and precipitation. Wax- and asphaltene-related problems include solid deposits, stabilization of a water–oil emulsion, and sludge production. Determination of wax and asphaltene contents is a routine analytical requirement for crude oil quality control. In order to study the composition and properties of waxes and asphaltenes, they are isolated from oil by specially developed procedures. In general, the asphaltenes are isolated from oils first; waxes are isolated from <b>deasphalted</b> oil. In other words, the waxes are isolated from the oil system from which the asphaltenes have been removed beforehand [from maltenes (Branthaver et al. 1983; Elsharkawy et al. 2000; Fazeelat 2006; Alcazar-Vara and Buenrostro-Gonzalez 2011) or saturates (Yang and Kilpatrick 2005; Lu et al. 2008)]. However, the traditional methods used to isolate asphaltenes by adding 40 volumes in excess of low boiling point paraffin hydrocarbons can produce a fraction which is contaminated with a significant amount of waxes (Chouparova and Philp 1998; Thanh et al. 1999; Liao et al. 2006; Acevedo et al. 2009; Coto et al. 2011). The presence of paraffin hydrocarbons in asphaltenes can be explained by their coprecipitation as a result of low solubility in low molecular weight n-alkanes (Thanh et al. 1999; Coto et al. 2011), by interaction between the alkyl lateral chains (C 7 –C 10) of asphaltenes with high molecular weight n-alkanes (Garcia and Carbognani 2001; Stachowiak et al. 2005; Ganeeva et al. 2014), and by their adsorption and/or occlusion inside asphaltene aggregates (Liao et al. 2005, 2006; Acevedo et al. 2009; Gray et al. 2011). Now, it is well-known that the asphaltenes exist as three-dimensional aggregates due to the strong intermolecular forces such as hydrogen bonding and π-bonding (Murgich 2002) and even at very low concentration as 50 – 150  mg/L in a good solvent such as toluene (Mullins et al. 2012). The wax coprecipitation increases the apparent yield of asphaltenes, decreases the yield of waxes, and leads to incorrect determination of the composition and properties of asphaltenes and waxes, to provide misleading and ambiguous results in modeling and treatment programs. Methods for the separation of waxes from asphaltenes have been developed (Thanh et al. 1999; Schabron et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|The authors {{aimed to}} study the <b>deasphalting</b> process on {{laboratory}} scale through the design and development of a subcritical and supercritical extraction experimental unit. The experimental unity used in tests is composed by a pump, an extractor with useful volume of 3 L and one separator vessel. Extractions in sub-and supercritical conditions were carried out using petroleum residue (vacuum residuum) as feed-stock and ethylic alcohol as solvent. Temperature and pressure were manipulated {{in order to maintain}} the solvent in the required conditions, thus facilitating the extraction process and avoiding sharp changes in the system. In both phases, the products in the deasphalted oil stream present adequate characteristics for the production of lubricant oils and those in the asphalt residue stream present an elevated concentration of asphalt molecules...|$|E
