40|$|The {{orifice plate}} flow meter {{is the most}} common form of {{differential}} pressure flow meter used in industry. The standard discharge coefficient, which is defined by both British Standard and [SO 5167, is only valid if the flow approaching the meter is perfectly settled and fully developed. However, in practical applications the flow approaching the orifice meter is often disturbed by pipe-fittings and consequently the measurements become inaccurate. Basically, the design of the orifice plate meters that are independent of the upstream disturbances is a main goal for orifice plate metering. Either using a long straight pipe, or a <b>flow</b> <b>conditioner</b> upstream of an orifice plate, usually achieves this goal. In this project the effect of the fractal <b>flow</b> <b>conditioner</b> for both standard and non-standard flow conditions has been investigated in an experimental rig and simulation work.

40|$|Purpose - The {{sensitivity}} of orifice plate metering to poorly conditioned and swirling flows are subjects of concerns to flow meter users and manufacturers. The distortions caused by pipe fittings and pipe installations upstream of the orifice plate are {{major sources of}} this type of non-standard flows. These distortions will alter the accuracy of metering up to an unacceptable degree. Design/methodology/approach - The design of orifice plate meters that are independent of the initial flow conditions of the upstream is a major object of flow metering. Either using a long straight pipe or a <b>flow</b> <b>conditioner</b> upstream of an orifice plate usually achieves this goal. The effect of cone swirler <b>flow</b> <b>conditioner</b> for both standard and non-standard flow conditions has been carried out in the experimental rig. The measuring of mass flow rate under different conditions and different Reynolds numbers were used to establish a change in discharge coefficient relative to a standard one.

Flow condit ioners are used extensively in orifice metering facilities upstream of the orifice in an attempt to produce fully developed turbulent pipe flow without the necessity of long upstream pipe lengths. Tube bundles are often installed as flow conditioners, but they have been proven to be ineffective in their attempt to produce fully developed turbulent pipe flow. Consequently, a new <b>flow</b> <b>conditioner</b> has been developed. It is termed the slotted orifice <b>flow</b> <b>conditioner.</b> This conditioner consists of a plate with a circular array of radial slots.

This was accomplished by measuring velocity profiles and turbulence intensities produced by the flow conditioners as-they were moved to various axial locations in a metering section which followed a 90 ' tee. Coefficients of discharge across an orifice with 0 = 0. 60 were measured with the flow conditioners upstream and a variety of distorted flow fields upstream of the conditioners. Neither the slotted orifice <b>flow</b> <b>conditioner</b> nor the tube bundle were capable of producing a fully developed turbulent pipe flow.
