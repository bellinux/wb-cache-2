5000|$|VCDS {{will perform}} {{most of the}} {{functions}} of the expensive electronic diagnostic tools available only to official dealers, like the current VAS 505x series diagnostic tools. [...] In the past, these dealership-only tools have prevented owners, and many small independent repair shops from performing some fundamental tasks, such as <b>diagnosing</b> <b>problems,</b> diesel ignition timing, modification of convenience options such as automatic door unlocking, coding a replacement electronic control unit (ECU) or key to the vehicle, and monitoring of many vehicle sensors for <b>diagnosing</b> <b>problems.</b> [...] Unlike generic on-board diagnostics (OBD-II or EOBD), VCDS uses the more in-depth Volkswagen Group-specific manufacturer protocol commands, which allows the user to access all diagnostic capable vehicle systems — even in vehicles which are not covered by generic OBD-II/EOBD (e.g. pre-1996). In general, {{there are two ways to}} use this software, either as a package (software and hardware) distributed by the manufacturer or their agents, or, by building your own interface hardware and using it with the publicly available but limited shareware version of the software.|$|E

50|$|As {{multiprocessing}} {{became more}} commonplace, such techniques would have limited practicality, since many independent processes would be stopped simultaneously. This {{led to the}} development of proprietary software from several independent vendors that provided similar features but deliberately restricted breakpoints and instruction stepping to particular application programs in particular address spaces and threads. The program state (as applicable to the chosen application/thread) was saved for examination at each step and restored before resumption, giving the impression of a single user environment. This is normally sufficient for <b>diagnosing</b> <b>problems</b> at the application layer.|$|E

It will also often have DIP switches to let the user connect or disconnect different signals in the cable, and it will usually have connector pins that let the user short pins together using electrical jumpers, or gain access to individual signal lines with an oscilloscope or other test equipment.|$|E

50|$|Error Location Analysis {{became a}} {{cornerstone}} technique for <b>diagnosing</b> <b>problems</b> with digital communications {{by identifying the}} precise location of bit-errors during a bit error rate testing session. Fundamental bit error rate testing is accomplished by comparing a communicated bit-stream with a reference (correct) bit-stream. The correct bits may be stored in a memory device or synthesized in real-time as reception of the communicated bit-stream occurs. It is common for these bit-streams to contain pseudo-random binary sequence (PRBS) patterns that permit easy synchronization {{with just a few}} correctly received consecutive bits. This self-synchronizing feature of PRBS patterns make them ideal for BERT testing. Traditional BERT devices possess generators that produce test bit-streams for output, and detectors that receive test bit-streams and count the number of bits being received and the number of mis-matches between the received and the reference bit-streams. Using the simple formula, BER = Number-of-Errors / Number-of-Bits-Transmitted,the BER is calculated. Error location analysis extends these fundamental features by employing a hardware memory device that effectively stores the value of the received bit counter whenever a mismatching error is detected. This produces a stream of error locations that are processed in real-time, and/or stored for post-processing. Many types of statistical processing algorithms were developed by SyntheSys Research, producing a comprehensive set of error location analysis tools.|$|E
50|$|In July 2014, Monitor was criticised by the Public Accounts Committee of the House of Commons (PAC) for {{the lack}} of {{clinical}} expertise and frontline NHS experience amongst its staff. The PAC noted that: “Only 21 of Monitor's 337 staff have an NHS operational background and only 7 have a clinical background, which damages Monitor's credibility in dealing with trusts and its effectiveness in <b>diagnosing</b> <b>problems</b> and developing solutions”. The PAC also criticised the proportion of Monitor’s budget spent on external consultants (£9 million of Monitor's £48 million budget in 2013-14) and found that “some NHS foundation trusts had been allowed to struggle for far too long in breach of their regulatory conditions. It has taken Monitor too long to help trusts in difficulty to improve, with three trusts having been in breach of their regulatory conditions since 2009”. At the time of the PAC’s hearing, of 147 foundation trusts 39(26%) were expected to be in deficit by the end of 2013-14 and on 31 December 2013 25 (17%) were in breach of the conditions attached to their status.The PAC also noted: “It is wholly inappropriate that the same person acted as both Chair and Chief Executive of Monitor between March 2011 and January 2014. This was contrary to corporate governance good practice and Monitor's own guidance to NHS foundation trusts”.|$|E
