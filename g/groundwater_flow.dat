40|$|ABSTRACT Expansion of Seattle-Tacoma International Airport (STIA) {{requires}} {{the importation of}} about 20 million cubic yards of fill. The fill would create an embankment up to 160 feet thick. Permitting {{requires the}} prediction of changes to flows in adjacent streams. The primary analysis tool was a basin-wide HSPF model supported by GIs. However, independent modeling of <b>groundwater</b> <b>flows</b> within the embankment predicted flow lags {{that could not be}} simulated by HSPF. Therefore, modeling of the embankment was conducted using a combination of numerical groundwater models. The groundwater analysis yielded daily lateral <b>groundwater</b> <b>flows</b> from soils {{at the base of the}} embankment, and downward leakage to a regional aquifer under the embankment. The lateral <b>groundwater</b> <b>flows</b> were imported back into HSPF as discharges directly to the stream, and the downward <b>groundwater</b> <b>flows</b> were imported back into the HSPF active groundwater reservoir. By this approach, water on and in the embankment was modeled independent of HSPF by methods that considered physical groundwater hydraulic variables, and reinserted back into HSPF at appropriate times and locations...|$|R

30|$|Groundwater {{recharge}} {{and horizontal}} <b>groundwater</b> <b>flows</b> play positive roles in retarding upward migration of thermal anomalies. Similarly, strong horizontal <b>groundwater</b> <b>flows</b> tend to dissipate slow-moving excess heat bubbles {{in such a}} way that there is no risk of them reaching shallow subsurface areas. Therefore, our results suggest that installation of a geothermal system after a proper analysis of groundwater recharge and horizontal water flow in the area would facilitate harvesting a large amount of geothermal energy while limiting the impact of the geothermal system to acceptable levels.|$|R
