50|$|A {{conventional}} loudspeaker is an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>transducer</b> {{that converts}} an electrical signal into sound. If locally powered, this {{can also be}} termed an active loudspeaker, meaning it contains an audio amplifier that can drive power to the speaker drivers. A network speaker implies the ability to drive audio to such a device from a network connection, usually over an Ethernet network or the Internet. In many cases this type of speaker also contains digital signal processing (DSP) to provide the audio crossover and other signal processing to provide frequency division and other tonal functions that exist in conventional speakers. Network speakers are also known as IP speakers. In many cases the IP speaker is created from an IP audio endpoint — a device as described above with the requisite network connection and ability to process audio packets, but without the actual physical speaker portion — that provides amplified audio to a conventional loudspeaker or unamplified audio (i.e. line-out) to an amplified speaker or system.|$|E

By using a looper pedal, a singer-guitarist in a one person band can play the backing chords (or riffs) to a song, loop them with the pedal, and then sing and do a guitar solo over the chords. Some units allow a performer to layer multiple loops, enabling the performer to create {{the effect of a}} full band. The first loop effects were created with reel-to-reel tape using a tape loop. High-end boutique tape loop effects are still used by some studio producers who want a vintage sound. Digital loop effects recreate this effect using an electronic memory.Looper effects: Boss RC-30 Loop Station.Reverb: Reverb units simulate the spacious sounds produced naturally in a huge stone cathedral (or other acoustic space such as a hall or room). This is done by creating a large number of echoes that gradually fade away in volume or [...] "decay". One early technique for creating a reverb effect was to send an amplified signal of the music via a speaker to another room with reflective surfaces, such as a tile bathroom, and then record the natural reverberations that were produced. A plate reverb system uses an <b>electromechanical</b> <b>transducer</b> to create vibrations in a plate of metal. Spring reverb systems, which are often used in guitar amplifiers, use a transducer to create vibrations in a spring.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports on}} a new {{approach}} for the analysis and design of vibration-to-electricity converters [vibration energy harvesters (VEHs) ] operating {{in the mode of}} strong electromechanical coupling. The underlying concept is that the mechanical impedance is defined for a nonlinear <b>electromechanical</b> <b>transducer</b> on the basis of an equivalence between electrical and mechanical systems. This paper demonstrates how the mechanical impedance of the transducer depends not only on the geometry {{and the nature of the}} <b>electromechanical</b> <b>transducer</b> itself but also on the topology and on the operation mode of the conditioning circuit. The analysis is developed for resonant harvesters and is based on the first-harmonic method.
