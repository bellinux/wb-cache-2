On July 17 against the Kansas City Royals, Jackson came to the plate {{in the bottom of}} the tenth inning with Thurman Munson on base and Martin put the bunt sign on. After Jackson fouled the first pitch off, the sign was taken off and Jackson was given the sign to swing away. Jackson bunted again, and then on the third pitch he bunted again and popped out. A furious Martin demanded Jackson be suspended for the remainder of the season after the game, but after conversing with upper management Martin agreed on a five-game suspension. Then, when Jackson returned, he told reporters that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> Martin had suspended him.|$|E

On Murray's first day of class, one professor, William Robert Ming, remarked that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> women went to law school. She was infuriated.|$|E

500|$|Stone gave Charlie Sheen {{the choice}} of Jack Lemmon or Martin Sheen to play his father in the film, and Sheen picked his father. The elder Sheen related to the moral sense of his character. Stone cast Daryl Hannah as Bud Fox's materialistic girlfriend Darien Taylor, but {{felt that she was}} never happy with the role and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> she {{accepted}} it. He tried to explain the character to Hannah repeatedly, and thought that the materialism of the character conflicted with Hannah's idealism. Stone said later that he was aware early on that she was not right for the part. [...] "Daryl Hannah was not happy doing the role and I should have let her go. All my crew {{wanted to get rid of}} her after one day of shooting. My pride was such that I kept saying I was going to make it work". Stone also had difficulties with Sean Young, who made her opinions known that Hannah should be fired and that she should play that role instead. Young would show up to the set late and unprepared. She did not get along with Charlie Sheen, which caused further friction on the set. In retrospect, Stone felt that Young was right and he should have swapped Hannah's role with hers. Stone admits that he had [...] "some problems" [...] with Young, but was not willing to confirm or deny rumors that she walked off with all of her costumes when she completed filming.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} {{which appeared in}} The New York Times, Williams said that the choices {{for many of the}} pieces of classical music were made by the studio. He also said that while he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>know</b> <b>why</b> certain pieces were chosen, Franz Schubert's Symphony No. 8 (commonly known as the Unfinished Symphony), which features prominently in the film, was most likely included because Anderton was a big fan of classical music in the script. Some of the other choices, such as Gideon's playing of Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring by Bach on an organ in the subterranean prison, were also in the screenplay, and he figured that [...] "hey are some writer's conception of what this character might have listened to." [...] Williams did choose the minuet from a Haydn string quartet (Op. 64, No. 1) which plays on the radio in the scene where Dr. Hineman is gardening in her greenhouse. He said he picked the piece because [...] "t {{seemed to me to be}} the kind of thing a woman like this would play on the radio." [...] The New York Times characterized the score as [...] "evocative" [...] and said it was [...] "thoroughly modern" [...] while also being [...] "interlaced with striking snippets of masterworks." [...] The piece heard when Anderton is shown entering his apartment and he tells his computer system [...] "I'm home" [...] is the 2nd movement of Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky's Symphony No. 6 in B minor, known as the [...] "Pathetique" [...] Symphony.|$|E

But Gerhardus Pretorius, who managed the Jacob Zuma Education Trust at the time, told the court that nobody ever told him of a significant donation expected from Thomson.
