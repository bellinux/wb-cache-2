2500|$|In {{the last}} quarter of the 20th century, {{researchers}} addressed the twin problems of water and impurities adhering to skis during spring conditions. Terry Hertel addressed both problems, first with the novel use of a surfactant that interacted with the wax matrix in such a way as to repel water effectively, a product introduced in 1974 by Hertel Wax. Hertel also developed the first fluorocarbon product and the first spring-time wax that repels and makes the running surface slick for spring time alpine ski and snowboard. This technology was introduced to the market in 1986 by Hertel Wax. [...] In 1990, Hertel filed for a U.S. patent on a [...] "ski wax for use with sintered-base snow skis", containing paraffin, a <b>hardener</b> wax, roughly 1% per-fluoroether diol, and 2% SDS surfactant. In the 1990s, Swix chief chemist Leif Torgersen found a glide wax additive to repel pollen and other snow impurities—a problem with soft grip waxes during distance races—in the form of a fluorocarbon that could be ironed into the ski base. The solution was based on the work of Enrico Traverso at , who had developed a fluorocarbon powder with a melting temperature just a few degrees below that of sintered polyethylene, patented in Italy as a [...] "ski lubricant comprising paraffinic wax and hydrocarbon compounds containing a perfluorocarbon segment".|$|E

50|$|Concrete can be colored in many ways; color <b>hardener,</b> {{integral}} liquid or powder, acid stains {{to name a}} few. The {{process of}} integrally coloring the concrete offers {{the advantage of the}} entire volume being colored; however, the surface strength is not increased as with the use of color <b>hardener.</b> Dry shake color <b>hardener</b> is another popular way to color concrete. You broadcast the <b>hardener</b> on the concrete as soon as it is floated for the first time. After letting the bleed water soak into the <b>hardener</b> you float and trowel it in. This method only covers the surface about 3/16 of an inch but it gives the concrete surface a longer wear life.|$|E
50|$|Curing may be {{achieved}} by reacting an epoxy with itself (homopolymerisation) or by forming a copolymer with polyfunctional curatives or <b>hardeners.</b> In principle, any molecule containing a reactive hydrogen may react with the epoxide groups of the epoxy resin. Common classes of <b>hardeners</b> for epoxy resins include amines, acids, acid anhydrides, phenols, alcohols and thiols.

Investigate the changes of reaction viscosities after adding different <b>hardeners,</b> nanoparticles and diluents to the polymer matrices. Analyze the applications to the automatic electronic packaging. The results show that different species in the curing reaction systems of epoxy will affect flow stabilities. Reaction viscositiesare affected primarily by the choice of <b>hardeners.</b> Nanoparticles will increase system viscosities and shorten matrix resin gel time. Adding diluents will help spread the powders and material flows in the systems, but is relatively not good for stability...|$|R

Cured and uncured EBCF were characterized by FTIR, DSC, and TGA techniques. Cured and uncured resins followed multistep degradation reactions.
