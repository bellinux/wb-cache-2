50|$|Tobrova tsässon {{is a small}} fir wood {{cross-beam}} {{building that}} has a square floor plan; it is connected by fishtail tenons in the corner. Corner tenons are axe-hewn; {{the walls of the}} building have also been hewn from the inside. Some of the wall beams have been replaced by newer ones: the lower log row in the entire building, two lower beams on the north-east side and two lower beams on the northern corner. The wall beams of the building in the corners {{and in the middle of}} the wall are standing on granite stones. The dimensions of the tsässon are 508 x 332 cm; the building has one interior room (12.3 m2) and an outer shelter of 2.3 m2. The entrance-room has square beam posts and a vertical boarding barrier. The supporting posts and barrier of the entrance-room has been replaced a few decades ago; a bit earlier, wider, sawn, vertical boards fixed side-by-side were used at the lower part of the barrier. Back then, the posts were axe-hewn square beams. The ceiling of the tsässon is finished by wide boarding, hammered to the rafters and forming a roof-ceiling. There are no ceiling-beams. The building stands on granite stones. The height of the wall from the ground up to where the rafters are attached is 188 cm and the height up to the ridge is 366 cm. The photos of 1974 and 1980 show that the building had a shingle roof that was in good condition, and now has eternit sheets on top of it. The ridge has a simple forged cross on it. A faded entry icon is under the eaves. The floor is made from hand hewn and dressed boards. The building has a door (92 x 146 cm) made from boards fixed on the crosspiece and attached on the hewn tender posts. Forged hinges with tips resembling bird heads are on the door. From the inside, the door does not have a finishing; sheeting with fishtail fluting is hammered on the outside. There is an alms box outside next to the door. The eastern side of the building has a wooden window with a single frame and three panes. The window with a trapdoor opens on the inside. The building has been inventoried during 1974. Fr. Dr. Fr. R.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. Management of the Naval integrated supply system depends on data to provide reliable {{information on the}} quantities of items in stock at any given time. Because of the high volume of transactions that continually alter data in the inventory system, <b>inventory</b> <b>record</b> errors are practically unavoidable. The purpose of this thesis {{is to determine the}} effects of inventory data errors on both cost and effectiveness of operations at a Naval inventory site. The methodology adopted for research consists of a series of multiple-item, single-warehouse, Monte Carlo simulations, focused on one U. S. Navy inventory site, using estimates of inventory data accuracy obtained at that site. Results of the simulations show that inventory costs can be decreased and customer demand effectiveness increased by decreasing the magnitude of <b>inventory</b> <b>record</b> errors to less than ten percent. It is therefore recommended that the Navy expand its inventory accuracy goal to require that no item have an <b>inventory</b> <b>record</b> error magnitude greater than ten percent. Inventory costs and effectiveness in meeting demand for Naval material were not found to be substantially affected by <b>inventory</b> <b>record</b> inaccuracy if the magnitude of error is less than ten percent.
