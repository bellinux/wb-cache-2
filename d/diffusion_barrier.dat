5|$|The gaseous {{diffusion}} process remained more encouraging, although it too had technical obstacles to overcome. By the end of 1943, Urey had over 700 people working for him on {{gaseous diffusion}}. The process involved hundreds of cascades, in which corrosive uranium hexafluoride diffused through gaseous barriers, becoming progressively more enriched at every stage. A major problem was finding proper seals for the pumps, but by far the greatest difficulty lay in constructing an appropriate <b>diffusion</b> <b>barrier.</b> Construction of the huge K-25 gaseous diffusion plant was well under way before a suitable barrier became available in quantity in 1944.

40|$|During Saccharomyces cerevisiae closed mitosis, parental {{identity}} is {{sustained by the}} asymmetric segregation of ageing factors. Such asymmetry has been hypothesized to occur via <b>diffusion</b> <b>barriers,</b> constraining protein lateral exchange in cellular membranes. <b>Diffusion</b> <b>barriers</b> have been extensively studied in the plasma membrane, but their identity and organization within the nucleus remain unknown. Here, we propose how sphingolipid domains, protein rings, and morphological changes of the nucleus may coordinate to restrict protein exchange between nuclear lobes. Our spatial stochastic model is based on several lines of experimental evidence and predicts that, while a sphingolipid domain and a protein ring could constitute the barrier during early anaphase; a sphingolipid domain spanning the bridge between lobes during late anaphase would be entirely sufficient. Additionally, we explore the structural organization of plausible <b>diffusion</b> <b>barriers.</b> Our work shows how nuclear <b>diffusion</b> <b>barriers</b> in closed mitosis may be emergent properties of simple nanoscale biophysical interactions.

50|$|Adhesion of a {{plated metal}} layer to its {{substrate}} requires a physical interlocking, inter-diffusion of the deposit or a chemical bonding between plate and substrate {{in order to}} work. The role of a <b>diffusion</b> <b>barrier</b> is to prevent or to retard the inter-diffusion of the two superposed metals. Therefore, to be effective, a good <b>diffusion</b> <b>barrier</b> requires inertness with respect to adjacent materials. To obtain good adhesion and a <b>diffusion</b> <b>barrier</b> simultaneously, the bonding between layers needs {{to come from a}} chemical reaction of limited range at both boundaries. Materials providing good adhesion are not necessarily good diffusion barriers and vice versa. Consequently, there are cases where two or more separate layers must be used to provide a proper interface between substrates.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{assesses the}} welfare impact {{of trade and}} {{technology}} diffusion {{as well as the}} change in the cross-country distribution of GDP due to removal of trade costs and <b>diffusion</b> <b>barriers.</b> The model extends the multi-country Ricardian trade model of Alvarez and Lucas (2007) to include technology <b>diffusion</b> with <b>diffusion</b> <b>barriers.</b> A key feature of the model is that some countries export goods produced by foreign technology via diffusion. The model is calibrated to match the world GDP distri-bution, the merchandise trade and technology diffusion shares of GDP, and real GDP per capita for a sample of 31 countries. Data on international trade in royalties, license fees, and information intensive services are used as proxies for international technol-ogy diffusion. There are three key findings. First, the welfare gains from removing <b>diffusion</b> <b>barriers</b> are 4 – 60 % across countries, generally larger than the gains from re-moving trade costs (8 – 40 %). The main reason is that diffusion has a larger impact on the nontradable sector due to the substitutability between trade and diffusion in the tradable sector.

50|$|Parylene N can be derivatized {{with respect}} to its main-chain phenyl ring and its {{aliphatic}} carbon bonds. The most common parylene is parylene C (one chlorine group per repeat unit, as shown above) followed by parylene D (two chlorine groups per repeat unit); both chlorine groups are on the main-chain phenyl ring. Because of its higher molecular weight, Parylene C has a higher threshold temperature, 90 °C, and therefore has a much higher deposition rate, while still possessing {{a high degree of}} conformality. It is also the most commonly used because of its price point. It can be deposited at room temperature while still possessing a high degree of conformality and uniformity and a moderate deposition rate >1 nm/s in a batch process. As a moisture <b>diffusion</b> <b>barrier,</b> the efficacy of coatings scales non-linearly with their density. Halogen atoms such as F, Cl and Br add much density to the coating and therefore allow the coating to be a better <b>diffusion</b> <b>barrier.</b> In that regard parylene D is a better <b>diffusion</b> <b>barrier</b> compared to parylene C; however, parylene D suffers from poor across-the-chamber uniformity and conformality at room temperature due to its high molecular weight (135 °C threshold temperature), as a result it is used much less than parylene C.|$|E

The adsorption site and two relevant diffusion channels are identified. The channels are characterized by different adatom-surface dimer interaction.
