40|$|According to {{projected}} and modelled {{ambient air}} concentrations, large scale exceedances of PM 10 limit values in Germany will continue despite implementation of current {{national and international}} legislation. Identification {{of the causes of}} these (current and projected) exceedances is crucial to develop successful mitigation options. Furthermore, it is necessary to examine in what way <b>further</b> <b>national</b> abatement <b>measures</b> are able to effectively ensure the PM 10 limit values as well as the expected PM 2. 5 limit values in the near future. This paper presents a method that is suitable to determine the causes for exceedances of PM 10 and to identify appropriate and cost efficient abatement measures to reduce the PM 10 concentrations in Germany. The contribution from transboundary transported particle precursors as well as the influence of biogenic and natural emission sources are explicitly considered in this methodology. About 100 measures for all considered emission sources and pollutants will be assessed. Nearly 300 concentration scenarios will be calculated and evaluated. The progress of the work is being documented...|$|R
40|$|The ‘War on Terror’ poses great {{challenges}} to democracies. The need for appropriate counter-terrorism measures prompts greater discretion {{to the executive}} in enacting adequate measures. This thesis demonstrates that since September 11 th 2001, the US and the UK have both modified and enacted <b>further</b> <b>national</b> security <b>measures</b> and anti-terrorism legislation accordingly. The thesis critically explores and examines the legality and constitutional legitimacy of the means that the US and UK have used, giving equal normative weight to national security and civil liberty imperatives. The focus is not merely between how this legislation strikes a balance between national security and civil liberties; it {{is also on the}} ways in which judicial intervention serves as a check to both executive and administrative measures. Thus, it is always necessary to conduct a balancing act between the rights of citizens to live in peace and security of persons and property, against the rights of individuals who may seek to threaten this. The core argument is that the history of both countries indicate that adhering to a human rights standard as far as possible, even in times of war, has both military and political benefits. Nevertheless, it is not claimed that all rights must be protected at all times. Instead, it seeks to establish a legal standard that recognises the need to protect human rights whilst also protecting security The thesis then turns to an examination of the judicial determinations in times of conflict between national security and civil liberties. The conclusion is that protecting national security interests {{is at the heart of}} all nations, however both the executive and the judiciary as upholders of the rule of law, should ensure the action taken is both adequate and necessary in the sense of proportionate (no more but also no less than what is called for). Thus, it calls for greater judicial oversight and accountability of executive action by using, as far as possible, the ordinary rules of criminal justice to deal with suspected terrorists. Furthermore, it is argued that to follow such a long term approach would provide an adequate platform for other countries in the struggle against terrorism. The thesis also identifies many lessons that can be learnt from the approach of the two countries...|$|R

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The {{objective of this}} project is to produce a large user-friendly and research-oriented database of the <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> that transpose EU directives into domestic law {{in order to provide}} the basis for large-N theoretically-based academic research on the causes of variance in the timing and quality of national implementation. The pre-existing databases on national transposition were not designed to facilitate academic research. The Commission publishes an annual report on the application of Community law, but it lists only the proportion of directives that have been transposed up to a given year, without providing data on delay of transposition. It also uses cumulative data since 1960, creating a severe upward bias in the national compliance record. The report tends to consider a directive transposed when the first measure has been notified by the Member States. But transposition normally needs more than one <b>national</b> <b>measure,</b> so the Commission’s data are likely overestimated compliance. Finally, no information is provided on the dates and instruments of national transposition. Recently, Celex, the EU legal database, has been opened to the public for free online consultation. The database contains approximately 3, 000 directives, but it is not designed in a way that could be immediately used for research purposes. Fields than contains dates need to be converted from string to date format. Deadlines for the adoption of <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> need to be separated from deadlines for the application. There are no fields containing the dates of adoption of <b>national</b> transposition <b>measures.</b> These need to be deducted from the title of <b>national</b> implementing <b>measures</b> or by other available means. Moreover, there are no fields that record the types on <b>national</b> <b>measures.</b> Finally, there are mistakes and missing information that need correcting and completing. The project consists of migrating the raw data available from Celex into an appropriately-designed database...|$|R
40|$|Background and aim: Breastfeeding {{is crucial}} for child {{survival}} and development, and exclusive breastfeeding is recommended {{for the first six}} months of the infant’s life, with continued breastfeeding until two years of age and beyond. Marketing of breastmilk substitutes has a negative impact on the recommended breastfeeding behaviour, and interferes with maternal and child rights. The International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes (the Code) was launched to guide breastfeeding promotion and regulate breastmilk substitutes marketing. The aim of this study is to examine the protection of breastfeeding through international recommendations and <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> adopting provisions from the Code, as well as the breastfeeding promotion and breastmilk substitutes marketing through mass media in five Southeast Asian countries. Methods: Media clips collected from January 2015 to January 2016 through media monitoring services were analysed, in addition to international frameworks in support of the protecting of breastfeeding and <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> for implementation of the Code. Relevant provisions from the Code were chosen to assess compliance. Results: Several international recommendations and human rights conventions are in support of breastfeeding. All the five countries studied had <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> for implementation of provisions from the Code, either legally enforceable or voluntary. “Growing-up milk” for children above 12 months was the most common product advertised for, counting for more than two thirds of the collected advertisement clips. Social medias were used by companies to promote all categories of breastmilk substitutes. Conclusions: Despite international frameworks and <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> to promote and protect breastfeeding, breastmilk substitutes are marketed through various media outlets. Companies are in violation of the Code, hindering states to fulfil their obligation to protect breastfeeding. There is a need for strengthening of <b>national</b> <b>measures</b> for implementation of the Code, especially in expanding the covered age range and better monitor compliance on social media outlets.
