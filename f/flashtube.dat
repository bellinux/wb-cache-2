25|$|Nd:YAG lasers are {{optically}} pumped using a <b>flashtube</b> or laser diodes. These {{are one of}} {{the most}} common types of laser, and are used for many different applications.|$|E
25|$|The {{light source}} is {{commonly}} a xenon flash lamp, or <b>flashtube,</b> {{which has a}} complex spectrum and a color temperature of approximately 5,600 kelvins. To obtain colored light, colored gels may be used.|$|E
500|$|For {{any given}} {{amount of light}} energy created, the diode lasers give off about [...] as much heat as a <b>flashtube.</b> Less heat, {{combined}} with active cooling {{in the form of}} helium blown between the diodes and the laser glass layers, eliminated the warming of the glass and allows Mercury to run continually. In 2008, Mercury was able to fire 10 times a second at 50 joules per shot for hours at a time.|$|E

50|$|Xenon <b>flashtubes</b> {{have been}} used to produce an intense flash of white light, some of which is absorbed by Nd:glass that {{produces}} the laser power for inertial confinement fusion. In total about 1 to 1.5% of the electrical power fed into the <b>flashtubes</b> is turned into useful laser light for this application.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Xenon <b>flashtubes</b> used on {{smartphones}} {{and cameras}} are usually externally triggered.|$|R
50|$|Because {{the liquid}} medium of a dye laser can fit any shape, {{there are a}} {{multitude}} of different configurations that can be used. A Fabry-PÃ©rot laser cavity is usually used for <b>flashtube</b> pumped lasers, which consists of two mirrors, which may be flat or curved, mounted {{parallel to each other}} with the laser medium in between. The dye cell is often a thin tube approximately equal in length to the <b>flashtube,</b> with both windows and an inlet/outlet for the liquid on each end. The dye cell is usually side-pumped, with one or more flashtubes running parallel to the dye cell in a reflector cavity. The reflector cavity is often water cooled, to prevent thermal shock in the dye caused by the large amounts of near-infrared radiation which the <b>flashtube</b> produces. Axial pumped lasers have a hollow, annular-shaped <b>flashtube</b> that surrounds the dye cell, which has lower inductance for a shorter flash, and improved transfer efficiency. Coaxial pumped lasers have an annular dye cell that surrounds the <b>flashtube,</b> for even better transfer efficiency, but have a lower gain due to diffraction losses. Flash pumped lasers can be used only for pulsed output applications.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to their}} high {{intensity}} and relative brightness at short wavelengths (extending into the ultraviolet) and short pulse widths, <b>flashtubes</b> are also ideally suited as light sources for pumping atoms in a laser to excited states {{where they can}} be stimulated to emit coherent, monochromatic light. Proper selection of both the filler gas and current density is crucial, so that the maximum radiated output-energy is concentrated in the bands that are the best absorbed by the lasing medium; e.g. krypton <b>flashtubes</b> are more suitable than xenon <b>flashtubes</b> for pumping Nd:YAG lasers, as krypton emission in near infrared is better matched to the absorption spectrum of Nd:YAG.|$|R
50|$|As {{with all}} ionized gases, xenon <b>flashtubes</b> emit light in various {{spectral}} lines. This {{is the same}} phenomenon that gives neon signs their characteristic color. However, neon signs emit red light because of extremely low current-densities when compared to those seen in <b>flashtubes,</b> which favors spectral lines of longer wavelengths. Higher current-densities tend to favor shorter wavelengths. The light from xenon, in a neon sign, likewise is rather violet. The spectrum emitted by <b>flashtubes</b> is far more dependent on current density than on the fill pressure or gas type. Low current-densities produce spectral-line emission, against a faint background of continuous radiation. Xenon has many spectral lines in the UV, blue, green, red, and IR portions of the spectrum. Low current densities produce a greenish-blue flash, indicating the absence of significant yellow or orange lines. At low current-densities, most of xenon's output will be directed into the invisible IR spectral lines around 820, 900, and 1000 nm. Low current-densities for <b>flashtubes</b> are generally less than 1000 A/cm2.|$|R

50|$|In 1960, after Theodore Maiman {{invented the}} ruby laser, a new demand for <b>flashtubes</b> began {{for use in}} lasers, and new {{interest}} was taken {{in the study of}} the lamps.|$|R
5|$|LLNL {{had begun}} {{exploring}} different {{solutions to the}} laser problem while the system was first being described. In 1996 they built a small testbed system known as the Mercury laser that replaced the <b>flashtubes</b> with laser diodes.|$|R
50|$|When {{operated}} below 30% of {{the explosion}} energy, <b>flashtube</b> lifetime is generally between a few million to {{tens of millions of}} flashes.|$|E
50|$|The flash that {{emanates from}} a xenon <b>flashtube</b> {{may be so}} intense that it can ignite {{flammable}} materials within a short distance of the tube. Carbon nanotubes are particularly susceptible to this spontaneous ignition when exposed to the light from a <b>flashtube.</b> Similar effects may be exploited for use in aesthetic or medical procedures known as intense pulsed light (IPL) treatments. IPL {{can be used for}} treatments such as hair removal and destroying lesions or moles.|$|E

50|$|Krytrons and sprytrons are {{triggered}} by a high voltage from a capacitor discharge via a trigger transformer, {{in a similar way}} <b>flashtubes</b> for e.g. photoflash applications are triggered. Devices integrating a krytron with a trigger transformer are available.|$|R
50|$|Nitrogen, in {{the form}} of air, has been used in <b>flashtubes</b> in home made dye lasers, but the {{nitrogen}} and oxygen present form chemical reactions with the electrodes, and themselves, causing premature wear and the need to adjust the pressure for each flash.|$|R

50|$|The {{light source}} is {{commonly}} a xenon flash lamp, or <b>flashtube,</b> {{which has a}} complex spectrum and a color temperature of approximately 5,600 kelvins. To obtain colored light, colored gels may be used.|$|E
5|$|One {{advantage}} of this design was that the diodes created light around the same frequency as the laser glass' output, {{as compared to the}} white light <b>flashtubes</b> where most of the energy in the flash was wasted as it was not near the active frequency of the laser glass. This change increased the energy efficiency to about 10%, a dramatic improvement.|$|R
40|$|A {{selective}} emitter pumped {{rare earth}} laser provides an additional type of laser {{for use in}} many laser applications. Rare earth doped lasers exist which are pumped with <b>flashtubes</b> or laser diodes. The invention uses a rare earth emitter to transform thermal energy input to a spectral band matching the absorption band of a rare earth in the laser {{in order to produce}} lasing...|$|R
50|$|<b>Flashtubes</b> produce {{very intense}} flashes, often {{faster than the}} eye can register, and may not appear as bright as they are. Quartz glass will {{transmit}} {{nearly all of the}} long and short wave UV, including the germicidal wavelengths, and can be a serious hazard to eyes and skin. This ultraviolet radiation can also produce large amounts of ozone, which can be harmful to people, animals, and equipment.|$|R

50|$|A gas-discharge lamp {{is capable}} of {{exceeding}} the spectral power of direct sunlight in the infrared, especially when pulsed. Modern open path systems typically use a xenon <b>flashtube</b> powered by a capacitor discharge. Such pulsed sources are inherently modulated.|$|E
5|$|NIF's laser uses {{a system}} of large <b>flashtubes</b> (like those in a {{photography}} flashlamp) to optically pump {{a large number of}} glass plates. Once the plates are flashed and have settled into a population inversion, a small signal from a separate laser is fed into the optical lines, stimulating the emission in the plates. The plates then dump their stored energy into the growing beam, amplifying it billions of times.|$|R
50|$|Ablative <b>flashtubes</b> are {{triggered}} by under-pressurizing. Ablative <b>flashtubes</b> are typically constructed using quartz tubing {{and one or}} both electrodes hollowed out, allowing a vacuum pump to be attached to control the gas pressure. The electrodes of the lamp are connected to a charged capacitor, and then the gas is vacuumed from the lamp. When the gas reaches a low enough pressure (often just a few torr) the lamp will self-flash. At such low pressures, {{the efficiency of the}} flash would normally be very low. However, because of the low pressure, the particles have room to accelerate to very high speeds, and the magnetic forces expand the arc so that the bulk of its plasma becomes concentrated at the surface, bombarding the glass. The bombardment ablates (vaporizes) large amounts of quartz from the inner wall. This ablation creates a sudden, violent, localized increase in the internal pressure of the lamp, increasing the efficiency of the flash to very high levels. The ablation, however, causes extensive wear to the lamp, weakening the glass, and they typically need replacement after a very short lifetime.|$|R
500|$|The {{process is}} {{extremely}} inefficient in energy terms; NIF feeds the <b>flashtubes</b> over 400MJ of energy which produces 1.8MJ of ultraviolet (UV) light. Due to {{limitations of the}} target chamber, NIF is only able to handle fusion outputs up to about 50MJ, although shots would generally be about half of that. Accounting for losses in generation, perhaps 20MJ of electrical energy might be extracted at the maximum, accounting for less than [...] of the input energy.|$|R
