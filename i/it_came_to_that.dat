2500|$|The Astros won the National League Division Series {{against the}} Atlanta Braves, 3-1, with a game four that set postseason records for most innings (18), most players {{used by a}} single team (23), and longest game time (5 hours and 50 minutes). Trailing by a score of 6-1, Lance Berkman hit an eighth inning grand slam to narrow the score to 6–5. In {{the bottom of the}} ninth, catcher Brad Ausmus, hit a game tying home run that allowed the game to {{continue}} in extra innings. In the bottom of the tenth inning, Luke Scott hit a blast to left field that had home run distance, but was inches foul. This game remained scoreless for the next eight innings. In the top of the fifteenth inning, Roger Clemens made only his second career relief appearance, pitching three shutout innings, notably striking out Julio Franco, at the time the oldest player in the MLB at 47 years old; Clemens was himself 43. In the bottom of the eighteenth inning, Clemens came to bat again, indicating that he would be pitching in the nineteenth inning, if <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> Clemens struck out, but the next batter, Chris Burke, hit a home run to left field for the Astros win, 7–6. Oddly enough, a fan in the [...] "Crawford Boxes" [...] in left field had previously caught Berkman's grand slam and this same fan caught Burke's home run. [...] The National League Championship Series featured a rematch of the 2004 NLCS. The Astros lost the first game in St. Louis, but would win the next three games, with Roy Oswalt getting the win. Though the Astros were poised to close out the series in Game Five in Houston, Brad Lidge gave up a monstrous two-out three-run home run to Albert Pujols, forcing the series to a sixth game in St. Louis, where the Astros clinched a World Series appearance. Roy Oswalt was named NLCS MVP, having gone 2–0 with a 1.29 ERA in the series. Current honorary NL President William Y. Giles presented the league champion Astros with the Warren C. Giles Trophy. Warren Giles, William's father and President of the National League from [...] to , had awarded an MLB franchise to the city of Houston in 1960.|$|E
60|$|She {{lifted her}} eyes, glistening with tears, and it touched his {{peculiar}} {{sense of humor}} to find her offering him reparation, when he had felt himself so outrageously to blame; {{but he would not}} be outdone in magnanimity, if <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
60|$|REGINALD [rising] How could I {{kick him}} out of the house? He's {{stronger}} than me: he could have kicked me out if <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> He did kick me out: what else was it but kicking out, to take my wife's affections from me and establish himself in my place? [He comes to the hearth].|$|E
60|$|Yes. No. Have {{we got to}} hide ourselves? Has <b>it</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> already? Oh, I hate myself.|$|R
60|$|No, I {{never will}} call you my dear lady; certainly, if <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> {{something}} too dreadful will follow.|$|R
60|$|Good Lord! Truly, sir, if <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> I must {{calculate}} over again; I think I didn't carry a small figure, sir.|$|R
6000|$|His mother hesitated. When <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> she did {{not like}} to {{recognise}} in his presence the anxieties that had troubled her. But [...] "I don't know," [...] she said, since she must. [...] "I shouldn't want to give that young girl, or her mother, the idea that we wished to make more of the acquaintance than--than you did, Tom." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{knew him}} to be at heart the kindest, most gentle of human beings, and the mere fact of his having been unsuccessful, even what some of his old {{neighbours}} might call stupid, did not change her feelings toward him in the least. He was Jed--that was sufficient for her, and she had business capability enough for both, when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b>|$|E
6000|$|But Mamie had {{not half}} done with her. She felt more and more--or she hoped at least--that she looked strange. She WAS, no doubt, if <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> strange. [...] "Lady Wantridge," [...] she almost convulsively broke out, [...] "I don't know whether you'll {{understand}} me, but I {{seem to feel}} that I must act with you--I don't know what to call it!--responsibly. He IS my brother." ...|$|E

6000|$|With this sublime and lofty purpose, {{he called}} upon Golly. The heroic girl saw his purpose in his eye--an eye at once black, murderous, and Christian-like. For an instant {{she thought it}} was better to succumb at once and thus end this {{remarkable}} attachment. Suddenly through this chaos of Spiritual, Religious, Ecstatic, Super-Egotistic whirl of confused thought, darted a gleam of Common, Ordinary Horse Sense! John Gale saw it illumine her blue eyes, and trembled. God in Mercy! If <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>THAT!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|Jill's {{face was}} white {{and her eyes were}} flaming. She {{dominated}} the roomful of girls like a little Napoleon. The change in her startled them. Hitherto they had always looked on her as rather an unusually quiet girl. She had always made herself unobtrusively pleasant to them all. They all liked her. But they had never suspected her of possessing this militant quality. Nobody spoke, but there was a general stir. She had flung a new idea broadcast, and it was beginning to take root. Do something? Well, if <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> why not? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right: I'll {{give her}} all I have." [...] And Miss Dosson's {{interlocutor}} {{leaned back in}} his chair with folded arms, as to signify how much, if <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> she might have to count with his patience. But she sat there easy and empty, giving no sign and fearing no future. He was the first indeed to turn again to restlessness: at the end of a few moments he asked the young lady if she didn't suppose her father had told her sister who it was.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must not}} let <b>it</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> We must have Lax {{up before the}} {{magistrate}} for having been present when they broke the flood gates." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A mere platonic friendship. We both {{collected}} autographs. And, if <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> {{how about}} Dora Thingummy? You {{had enough to}} say about her last winter." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I had no {{opportunity}} of asking her any question, until I {{had told the}} brothers she was sinking fast, and could not live another day. Until then, though no one was ever presented to her consciousness save the woman and myself, one or other of them had always jealously sat behind the curtain {{at the head of}} the bed when I was there. But when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> they seemed careless what communication I might hold with her; as if--the thought passed through my mind--I were dying too.|$|E
6000|$|... "In {{that case}} {{we should not}} be {{opposing}} our wills to the will of some one else, who has a better claim to her daughter's allegiance than I have. It seems to me that our error was in letting her mother consent to our engagement if she would not or could not consent to our marriage. When <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> we ought both to have had the strength to say that then there should be no engagement. It was my place to do that. I could have prevented the error which I can't undo." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You may think," [...] said she, [...] "that, {{knowing what}} I did, {{it was very}} queer {{for me to come}} out to you this morning, but I could not help it. You were getting dreadfully careless, and were staying so late and doing things which people would have been bound to notice, {{especially}} as father is always talking about our enjoying the fresh hours of the morning, that I felt I could not let you go on any longer. And when <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> fan business I saw plainly that you must either immediately start for Europe or--" ...|$|E

60|$|Bartley stood {{a moment}} in the fury that tempted him to pursue her with a taunt, and then leave her to work herself out of the {{transport}} of senseless jealousy she had wrought herself into. But he set his teeth, and, full of inward cursing, he followed her up-stairs with a slow, dogged step. He took her in his arms without a word, and held her fast, while his anger changed to pity, and then to laughing. When <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> she put up her arms, which she had kept rigidly at her side, and laid them round his neck, and began softly to cry on his breast.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well! I wish it {{had been}} ten {{thousand}} fathoms under ground, with its church-lands, and tithes, and all that belongs to it. Had {{it not been for}} this cursed rectory, I should have been permitted to follow the bent of my own inclinations and the profession of arms, and half the courage and address that I have displayed among smugglers and deer-stealers would have secured me an honourable rank among my contemporaries. Why did I not go abroad when I left this house!--Why did I leave it at all!--why--But <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> point with me that it is madness to look back, and misery to look forward!" ...|$|E
6000|$|One {{effect of}} running causes fast through the Courts below is, {{that they go}} by scores to appeal, and Lord Gifford[283] has {{hitherto}} decided them with such judgment, and so much rapidity, as to give great satisfaction. The consequence will in time be, that the Scottish Supreme Court will be in effect situated in London. Then down fall--as national objects of respect and veneration--the Scottish Bench, the Scottish Bar, the Scottish Law herself, and--and--"there is an end of an auld sang."[284] Were I as I have been, I would fight knee-deep in blood ere <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> But it is a catastrophe which the great course of events brings daily nearer-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> we don't in my country!... Say, boys, when you're {{through with}} your English mail you might's well provide an escort for your prisoner. He's waitin'." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Fate settles these things," [...] he muttered, [...] "and if <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> maybe God {{will give}} her strength. But the dawn is near, and by it {{we may see}} land." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course that}} sort of thing has its rough points for the second man, but in this case I do not think they amount to much. Brownson's affair with the younger lady would have come to an end as soon as she had {{discovered}} the rocks in his character, but her mother broke it off before <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> But I do not think she would have gone into the sisterhood, {{if it had not been}} for the man's death very soon after the breaking of the engagement. This affected her very much, but there was no reason why it should, for he was killed in a railway accident, and I am positively certain that he would have married some one else if he had lived long enough." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Paltry little fool! It will be {{long enough}} before such a chaunt as that is heard in any English cathedral again." [...] Then Mrs. Grantly got up and kissed her husband, but he, {{somewhat}} negligent of the kiss, went on with his speech. [...] "But your father remembers nothing of it, {{and if there was}} a single human being who shed a tear in Barchester for that woman, I believe it was your father. And it was the same with mine. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> at last, that I could not bear to speak to him of any shortcoming as to one of his own clergymen. I might as well have pricked him with a penknife. And yet they say men become heartless and unfeeling as they grow old!" ...|$|E
6000|$|What had he to go on? Well, nothing much, if <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> {{except the}} {{knowledge}} that she lived some two hours by train out of London, and that her journey started from Waterloo Station. What would Sherlock Holmes have done? Concentrated thought supplied no answer to the question; {{and it was at}} this point that the cheery optimism with which he had begun the day left George and gave place to a grey gloom. A dreadful phrase, haunting in its pathos, crept into his mind. [...] "Ships that pass in the night!" [...] It might easily turn out that way. Indeed, thinking over the affair in all its aspects as he dried himself after his tub, George could not see how it could possibly turn out any other way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, no," [...] said my wife contemplatively; [...] "I suppose {{your people}} are all heathens. Why, {{goodness}} gracious, Mr. Chung, if <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>that,</b> I suppose really you are a heathen yourself!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} be alive to do it, Miss. I shall have died in your defence before <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>to</b> <b>that.</b> They must step across my body to lay a hand on you." ...|$|R
