50|$|Thieves <b>disarm</b> <b>traps,</b> steal and fight.|$|R
50|$|Thieves can <b>disarm</b> <b>traps</b> (including a mini game). They are the {{cheapest}} ranged fighters (35 Credits). They have strong offensive potential and survive via evasion.|$|R
50|$|Instead of {{polyhedral}} dice, {{the game}} uses 6 Attack dice, 1 reveal <b>traps</b> die, 1 <b>disarm</b> <b>traps</b> die, 1 special die and 1 turn undead die.|$|R
50|$|The dwarf is {{the only}} {{character}} that can <b>disarm</b> <b>traps</b> {{without the aid of}} the specialised kit which is either bought in the armory or found during certain quests.|$|R
50|$|Yukyuk was a kobold ranger/rogue {{who first}} {{appeared}} to sneak-attack Vaarsuvius from atop a dog named Sir Scraggly. He wielded twin crossbows. During {{the battle in}} the Empire of Blood, he was Dominated by Vaarsuvius as a weapon against Zz'dtri. Yukyuk's attacks proved effective, due to Zz'dtri having chosen which spells to prepare that day based on countering any of the direct attacks Vaarsuvius normally prefers. The Order still had him under their control, and attempted to use him to <b>disarm</b> <b>traps</b> in the Windy Canyon, only to discover he had no skill at <b>disarming</b> <b>traps.</b> He was eventually slain during an attack by the Linear Guild when Zz'dtri fired an Empowered Vitrolic Sphere.|$|R
25|$|Rogue: A {{master of}} ranged weapons. While {{not as strong}} as the Warrior, the rogue is very {{effective}} at attacking enemies from a distance with the bow. The Rogue's primary character attribute is Dexterity. The Rogue's unique starting skill is the ability to <b>disarm</b> <b>traps.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Thief, Burglar, Scoundrel, or Rogue is a {{character}} class in many role-playing games, including Dungeons & Dragons, Final Fantasy, World of Warcraft and many MMORPGs. Thieves are usually stealthy and dexterous characters able to <b>disarm</b> <b>traps,</b> pick locks, spy on foes, and perform backstabs from hiding.|$|R
5000|$|The thief was the robber, the thug, or the [...] "expert {{treasure}} hunter". They {{specialized in}} {{the acquisition of}} goods, stealth, and <b>disarming</b> <b>traps.</b> Unlike in 1st edition, 2nd edition allows thieves to specialize in skills so that they needed only a few levels to master two skills.|$|R
5000|$|Darktan - {{the leader}} of the rats' Trap Disposal Squad. After his near-death {{experience}} and the death of Hamnpork, Darktan becomes the Clan's new leader. Darktan, although an older rat, is much more progressive than Hamnpork. He is well-respected by all the rats because his knowledge of how to <b>disarm</b> <b>traps</b> helps keep them alive.|$|R
5000|$|Dwarf: The dwarf figurine is short, stocky {{and well}} armored, {{carrying}} a battle axe. He {{is very good}} in health, but lacks the attack strength of the barbarian and has no magical abilities. The dwarf also has the unique ability {{of being able to}} <b>disarm</b> <b>traps</b> without special equipment. His starting weapon is a short sword.|$|R
5000|$|The game {{presents}} the action from a top-down perspective. Players explore 25 procedurally-generated levels, looking on each level for treasure, a lever {{to unlock the}} stairs to the next level, and then the stairs themselves. At the same time the player tries to avoid harmful spike and steam traps. [...] Players are asked to manage three statistics: Dodge, representing their ability to avoid damage from traps; Detect, representing their ability to discern hidden traps; and Disable, representing their ability to <b>disarm</b> <b>traps</b> to proceed past them. Players also collect health tonics, which can be consumed to restore life energy, and disposable tools, which can be used to <b>disarm</b> <b>traps,</b> as well as a range of equipment which can be used to boost {{some or all of the}} three statistics. Gold can also be found, which serves no purpose during the game but acts as a scoring mechanism.|$|R
50|$|Cookie & Cream lets players {{navigate}} {{their way}} through terrain on the top screen while solving puzzles and <b>disarming</b> <b>traps</b> on the touch screen below. Played as either a single-player game where one person controls both characters, or a cooperative game where one player maneuvers Cookie on the top screen while the other {{is in charge of}} Cream on the touch screen. You are able to play with a friend on the same unit or via Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection. Cookie & Cream also includes nine mini games and additional features.|$|R
5000|$|Fourth edition Rogues are swashbucklers, {{focused on}} getting {{to where the}} enemy does not want them and hurting them by {{applying}} extra [...] "sneak attack" [...] damage to enemies that grant combat advantage to them (for instance because they are flanking the enemy or the enemy is dazed or prone). They are also highly skilled, with the most trained skills of any class {{in the game and}} all with training in stealth and thievery (a skill that includes picking locks and pockets, and <b>disarming</b> <b>traps).</b> In fourth edition rules, there are two very different mechanical conceptions of the same class; Rogues and Thieves.|$|R
50|$|To {{speed up}} and ease the {{character}} creation process, many games use character templates of some sort: Sample characters representing genre-typical archetypes {{that are either}} completely ready-made or at least define the essential stats necessary for a character {{to be able to}} work in a given occupation or fill some dramatic role.For instance, a thief will probably know how to move quietly, pick locks, <b>disarm</b> <b>traps,</b> and climb walls.The use of character templates enables inexperienced players to easily create suitable characters as they won’t be overwhelmed with having to select skills and abilities, and it still speeds up character creation for even the most experienced players.|$|R
50|$|The player {{controls}} a {{party of}} four player characters (PCs). The party of PCs {{can be made up}} of any combination of the following character types: cleric, fighter, magic-user, thief, dwarf, elf, and halfling. Fighters are the strongest in battle and are the most skilled with weapons. Dwarves share the talents of a fighter. Magic-users are the best at learning magic but they are the weakest fighters. Elves have a good balance between fighting and spellcasting, but do not excel in either. Clerics have healing and support-based magic spells and are reasonably competent in battle, and they can use their holy powers to repel the undead. Thieves are stealthy, can <b>disarm</b> <b>traps</b> and hide in shadows, and eventually develop minor magic capabilities. Halflings share the talents of a thief but suffer at combat.|$|R
50|$|Diablo offers three {{character}} {{classes and}} the Hellfire expansion offers three more. Players can play as Warriors, Rogues (archers), or Sorcerers. Each class {{has its own}} place in the game's history, and all three classes make appearances as non-player characters in the sequel. All three classes have the same general skills {{and access to the}} same spells. Each of them has a class-specific skill (Item Repair, <b>Trap</b> <b>Disarm,</b> and Staff Recharge, respectively) that has as many drawbacks as benefits, except for <b>Trap</b> <b>Disarm.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Myau (ミャウ) is an intelligent, talking, cat-like {{creature}} {{called a}} Musk Cat. Alis meets {{him in a}} pet store on Motavia, where the owner is {{trying to sell the}} Musk Cat for an exorbitant amount of money, but instead trades him in exchange for a valuable Laconian pot from Alis. Myau is on a mission to save his friend Odin, who has been turned to stone by Medusa. He has the medicine to cure Odin, but cannot open the bottle, for he has no fingers, and so requests Alis' help to save him. Myau uses claws as weapons, can use stronger curative magic than Alis, and can <b>disarm</b> <b>traps</b> in dungeons. Musk Cats also have an interesting [...] "reaction" [...] to the Laerma nuts found on Dezoris, a fact which makes Myau even more valuable. He is the speed-type character of the game.|$|R
50|$|Anti-hunting campaigners {{are divided}} into {{those who believe in}} direct {{intervention}} and those who watch the hunt to monitor for cruelty and report violations of animal welfare laws. Interventionists may lay false trails or use sound and visual distractions to prevent the hunters from being successful, and enter hunting estates and farms to <b>disarm</b> animal <b>traps.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Pointman: Acting as a team's frontal assault unit, {{their main}} {{task is to}} provide {{advancing}} cover and to spot and <b>disarm</b> enemy <b>traps.</b> They come equipped with smoke grenades, shotguns and submachine guns. More experienced players can use the Pointman as an infiltrator to root out enemy tunnels and ambush squads using Claymore mines. The NLF and PAVN variant is called the Scout and carries tripwire kits instead of Claymore mines.|$|R
50|$|The Corps {{provides}} combat engineering, {{construction and}} other technical {{support to the}} Sri Lankan Army and civil authorities. One of {{the objectives of the}} corps is mobility and counter mobility. That is providing mobility to friendly forces while denying movement to enemy forces. Engineers are able to conduct tasks including penetrating minefields, locating and <b>disarming</b> booby <b>traps,</b> purifying water and building roads and bridges to maintain lines of communications.|$|R
50|$|There are a {{total of}} twenty three unique skills {{available}} in the game, divided among four distinct categories. There are six attack skills, such as blade or unarmed combat, that determine what types of weapon a character can use, and how effective that character is when using them. The three defensive skills, armor, dodging, and shield, determine what forms of armor a character can use, {{as well as his}} or her ability to parry enemy attacks. The four magic abilities correspond the four schools of magic available in the game (dark, elemental, light, and spirit) and determine a character's ability to cast particularly magic spells in each school. The final category covers miscellaneous skills, such as the ability to <b>disarm</b> <b>traps,</b> or to repair items that have been broken. Each skill comes in four levels of proficiency: normal, expert, master, and grand master, and the class of a character affects the skills {{that he or she is}} capable of learning. For instance, the Gladiator class can only attain the expert level of the thrown weapons skill, while the assassin can reach the grand master level.|$|R
50|$|Afghanistan has an {{extensive}} series of historic tunnels used for transporting water, the kariz, {{and during the}} 1979-1989 Soviet war in Afghanistan, such tunnels were used by Mujahideen fighters. The Soviet 40th Army had their own tunnel rats, who were tasked with flushing {{people out of the}} tunnels, then going through the tunnels to <b>disarm</b> booby <b>traps</b> and kill those who remained. The United States Marine Corps and the Royal Marines are involved in similar work during the current ongoing war in Afghanistan.|$|R
50|$|Metal Gear Mk. II, the Invisible Buddy, can back up Snake on the field. The Mark II is {{equipped}} with stealth camo and can display a magazine on its viewscreen to captivate the interest of nearby characters. It communicates with Snake using the character voice of Otacon from MGS4. It can also use its manipulator to electroshock enemies, collect and deliver dogtags to Snake, <b>disarm</b> mechanical <b>traps,</b> and knock on walls. If the Mark II's life gauge is depleted by enemy fire, it will self-repair over time.|$|R
25|$|Each of {{the five}} {{characters}} have their own unique fighting style and their own specific set of spells and feats. Gameplay strategy is thus different for each character. Dorn is a Barbarian, and his feats {{tend to focus on}} increasing his brute strength and ability to resist damage, as well as granting him powerful abilities to aid in melee combat, such as the ability to wield two-handed weapons in each hand. Vhaidra relies on unarmed combat, so her feats tend to focus on increasing her speed and combos, as well as granting her close-range abilities, such as pushing enemies away from her. As Ysuran is a necromancer, his feats tend to focus on increasing the power of his magic and granting him new spells, such as the ability to use shadow magic. Borador tends more towards archery, but is also capable of melee combat. His spells tend to focus on allowing him to use a shield offensively, and granting him the ability to set traps for enemies and <b>disarm</b> <b>traps</b> intended for the player. Allessia is a cleric and has access to many healing and defensive spells. She can also use melee combat. Later in the game she gains the ability to reanimate the dead, and have them fight alongside her.|$|R
5000|$|Rock Paper Shotgun {{opened its}} review by {{acknowledging}} Uwe Boll's reputation for poorly-received film adaptations of video game franchises; noting that it featured the typical [...] "motifs" [...] {{of his works}} (such as poor dialogue and an abundance of caves), Tunnel Rats was described as being [...] "excruciatingly, bewilderingly bad, such that the predominant thought while playing was: How? How {{is it possible to}} make a game this egregiously bad, one that so fundamentally doesn't understand even the basics of what a game is meant to be." [...] The game was criticized for its writing and voice acting (which also resulted in the protagonist being characterized as [...] "a petulant and hateful little idiot"), gameplay mechanics requiring frustrating levels of precision (including the process of <b>disarming</b> <b>traps,</b> and respectively collecting dog tags and ears from the bodies of American and Vietnamese soldiers to re-gain health), disproportionate amounts of fall damage from low heights, an inability to manually restart a level or save) and bugs such as grenades no longer working on a level if they die. Bugs also prevented the reviewer from completing the second level). GamesRadar similarly criticized the game for being a [...] "nauseating mess from start to finish", but jokingly felt it was better than Uwe Boll's films.|$|R
5000|$|The rogue or thief {{is one of}} the {{standard}} playable character classes in most editions of the Dungeons & Dragons fantasy role-playing game. A rogue is a versatile character, capable of sneaky combat and nimble tricks. The rogue is stealthy and dextrous, and in 2nd edition was the only official base class from the Player's Handbook capable of finding and <b>disarming</b> many <b>traps</b> and picking locks. The rogue also has the ability to [...] "sneak attack" [...] ("backstab" [...] in previous editions) enemies who are caught off-guard or taken by surprise, inflicting extra damage.|$|R
5000|$|GameSpot {{felt that}} Tunnel Rats had [...] "clumsy and inconsistent" [...] writing and voice acting, and criticized the {{characterization}} of Brooks for making him [...] "one of the least sympathetic heroes you'll ever play as", describing him as [...] "a cruel, foul-mouthed jerk who is often deranged but never witty. He is apparently {{supposed to be on}} a character arc that sends him to the cusp of madness, but in reality he's insane from the start." [...] These criticisms also cited the frequent use of inner monologues to advance the game's story. The mechanic of collecting ears from dead Vietnamese soldiers was considered to be in bad taste due to Brooks' personality, and his spoken remarks when doing so. The game's environments, particularly tunnels, were considered to be monotonous and dated-looking, while the guns' iron sights were criticized for being inaccurate in comparison to the normal on-screen crosshairs. The game was also criticized for its bugs, short length, and the high level of precision required to collect trophies and <b>disarm</b> <b>traps</b> in the environment. Giving the game a 2.5 out of 10, GameSpot argued that Tunnel Rats [...] "seems to have a strange notion of what constitutes 'fun.' Does anyone enjoy searching for booby traps in repetitive, brown tunnels or listening to a psychotic man-child rant about his father?" ...|$|R
50|$|Tunnel Rats: 1968 is a first-person shooter {{developed}} by Replay Studios as a tie-in for the Uwe Boll film 1968 Tunnel Rats. The gameplay involves <b>disarming</b> booby <b>traps,</b> collecting ears from fallen enemies and collecting dog tags from fellow deceased soldiers. According {{to an interview}} with Uwe Boll, the game {{was meant to be}} released on the Xbox 360, but it ultimately has never had an official retail release, and the only digital distribution store that offers the game is Steam. The story takes place after the movie's events as the player character attempts to find the original crew from the film.|$|R
25|$|The RAE {{provides}} combat engineering, {{construction and}} other technical {{support to the}} Australian Defence Force. Its main roles are to provide mobility and counter mobility capabilities to the Australian Army and its allies. This means enhancing the ability of friendly forces to move while denying movement to enemy forces. In order to provide these capabilities, engineers are required to conduct many tasks including penetrating minefields, locating and <b>disarming</b> booby <b>traps,</b> clearing unexploded ordnance, conducting explosive demolitions, purifying water, surveying, and building and maintaining roads, airfields and bridges. The Corps also performs {{the majority of the}} Australian Army's demolition tasks and is trained to fight as infantry if needed.|$|R
50|$|Devlin {{suggests}} evacuating the station, but Meyer {{points out}} the shuttle's navigation computer is still wiped. LaPaz reveals that the pilot (Brooks) has a backup stored in a chip inside her head, which is why LaPaz saved her corpse from being flushed out into space. While Devlin retrieves the chip, Meyer discovers a booby-trap on the shuttle intended for Devlin. Meyer needs time to <b>disarm</b> the <b>trap,</b> so Devlin and LaPaz hunt down and destroy one of the shape-shifters using a corrosive formula developed by Mogami-Hudson. The remaining two return to the shuttle, only for Meyer to tell them Lowe (who disappeared during the hunt) was a shape-shifter whom he had just fought off.|$|R
50|$|After feigning ignorance, the {{old woman}} reveals his next challenge: to set a {{stainless}} steel wire across the road. Elliot is horrified when he realizes {{that a group of}} bikers have been instructed to speed down the road. Although he <b>disarms</b> the <b>trap</b> in time, the other competitor rearms the trap, and the cyclists are decapitated. Disgusted, Elliot quits the game, and, when he returns home, discovers that Michael is the other competitor. Michael reveals that the final challenge is to kill a family member. Although Elliot originally tries to talk Michael out of killing their father, Elliot becomes homicidal when their father reveals he won the game by killing their mother. To prevent his sons from experiencing the horror of winning the game, their father commits suicide.|$|R
5000|$|Johnny (Akiba), a Trap Otaku, {{can see all}} traps on the field, and <b>disarm</b> {{mechanical}} <b>traps</b> into items. Three consecutive kills stir up his chronic incontinence, {{resulting in}} a comical cloud of foul smell that can preoccupy foes and allies. When injuring a teammate, he leaves himself vulnerable while making excuses. Johnny can't use any form of CQC but the 3 hit combo, {{and he has no}} SOP enabling nanomachines, which restricts him from the advantages of information garnered through his teams SOP network but has the positive effect of making him immune to the negative effects of SOP such as Ocelots Guns of the Patriots weapon or SOP Destabs. His unique weapons include the XM8 Compact and the M82A2 Sniper Rifle, which kills with 1 shot from any range.|$|R
40|$|International audienceRecently it {{has been}} {{suggested}} that low fertility countries may be caught in a trap that is hard to get out of. One important mechanism in such a trap would be social interaction and its effect on the ideal family size. Such social interaction mechanisms are hard to capture in formal models, therefore we use an agent-based simulation model to investigate the issue. In our experimental setup a stable growth and population path is calibrated to Swedish data using the Swedish social policy setup. The model is provoked into a fertility trap by increasing relative child costs linked to positive growth. Even rather large increases in child benefits are then insufficient to get out of the trap. However, the small number of children temporarily enables the economy to grow faster for several decades. Removing the adaptation of social norms turns out to <b>disarm</b> the <b>trap...</b>|$|R

50|$|In many {{role-playing}} games, such as Dungeons & Dragons {{and other}} fantasy franchises, rogue is often considered a character class. The characters vary widely but are commonplace in the genre, and {{are considered a}} vital part of a balanced party. Rogues are typically dexterous and possess many skills, allowing them to excel in many areas of expertise. The rogue character's focus is often on finesse over raw strength, making them use wit and traps before direct confrontation in a fight, adept at picking locks, <b>disarming</b> and laying <b>traps,</b> use stealth and other unconventional approaches to accomplishing their goals.|$|R
40|$|Neutrophil {{extracellular}} traps (NETs) {{are crucial}} for the host innate immune response against invading pathogens. Composed of potent antimicrobial effectors embedded in a DNA backbone, they <b>trap,</b> <b>disarm</b> and kill {{a wide variety of}} pathogens. Although NETs have been recognized as a novel microbial killing strategy, there remains a gap in the understanding of the mechanisms regulating their formation. Recently, the process of NET formation was described as a new paradigm in cell death programs, which was later termed NETosis. This review summarizes recent progress made in the identification of the mechanisms underlying NETosis. In addition, attention is given to the role of NETs in health and disease and to mechanisms certain leading bacteria have developed to counteract the effects of NETs...|$|R
