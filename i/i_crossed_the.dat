I got possession of the letters my antagonist addressed to the Secretary at War, and also of the sentiments which hundreds of his army uttered to their friends. Confidence in the General was gone, and evident despondency prevailed throughout. I have succeeded beyond expectation. <b>I</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> river contrary to the opinion of Cols. Procter, St. George etc.; it is therefore no wonder that envy should attribute to good fortune what in justice to my own discernment, I must say, proceeded from a cool calculation of the pours and contres.|$|E

When Demetrius advanced far into India one of his generals, Eucratides, made himself king of Bactria, and soon in every province there arose new usurpers, who proclaimed themselves kings and fought against each other.|$|E

500|$|From the {{beginning}} of January 1883, Mahler became conductor at the Royal Municipal Theatre in Olmütz (now Olomouc) in Moravia. He later wrote: [...] "From the moment <b>I</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> threshold of the Olmütz theatre I felt like one awaiting the wrath of God." [...] Despite poor relations with the orchestra, Mahler brought nine (13 times) operas to the theatre, including the new Bizet's Carmen, and won over the press that had initially been sceptical to him. After a week's trial at the Royal Theatre in the Hessian town of Kassel, Mahler became the theatre's [...] "Musical and Choral Director" [...] from August 1883. The title concealed the reality that Mahler was subordinate to the theatre's Kapellmeister, Wilhelm Treiber, who disliked him (and vice-versa) {{and set out to}} make his life miserable. Despite the unpleasant atmosphere, Mahler had moments of success at Kassel. He directed a performance of his favourite opera, Weber's Der Freischütz, and 25 other operas. on 23 June 1884, he conducted his own incidental music to Joseph Victor von Scheffel's play Der Trompeter von Säckingen ("The Trumpeter of Säckingen"), the first professional public performance of a Mahler work. An ardent, but ultimately unfulfilled, love affair with soprano Johanna Richter led Mahler to write a series of love poems which became the text of his song cycle Lieder eines fahrenden Gesellen ("Songs of a Wayfarer").|$|E

2500|$|A year later, {{he had a}} {{hit with}} [...] "Obart Al Shat" [...] (<b>I</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> river). Some of his professors at the Academy denounced it as sha'bi (pop) music, {{anathema}} to those who taught classical music. Al-Saher had managed to circumvent the system and had become a star on his own terms—he even undertook his first US tour in 1989. Having conquered pop, Al Saher turned around and established himself in the Arabic classical world with [...] "La Ya Sadiki" [...] (No, My Friend), a magnum opus that lasted almost an hour and found him using maqams (scales) that hadn't been used in Iraqi music in several decades, revitalizing a tradition.|$|E

It will say that I am world champion, but we are all champions– and they deserve this." [...] In the May 2007 issue of F1 Racing, Alonso said that the 2005 Brazilian Grand Prix was his greatest race.

2500|$|The {{origin of}} the {{conflict}} between Kadi Burhan al-Din and the Ottomans lies {{at the beginning of}} their expansion into central and eastern Anatolia, during the later years of Murad I (. Under Murad, this expansion was, in the words of historian Dimitris Kastritsis, [...] "generally justified through marriage alliances and other diplomatic means." [...] Following Murad's death at the Battle of Kosovo, however, the Anatolian beyliks sensed an opportunity to restore their fortunes and formed an anti-Ottoman league under the Karamanid ruler Ala ad-Din Ali: the Karamanids advanced up to Eskişehir, the Germiyanid ruler Yakub II restored his principality, and Burhan al-Din took Kırşehir. As a result, Murad's son and successor Bayezid <b>I</b> (...) <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> Dardanelles with his own forces, supported by the armies of the Jandarid Süleyman Pasha of Kastamonu and the Christian vassal states of the Balkans— mainly Serbia and the Byzantine Empire—and launched a campaign to [...] "unify Anatolia under Ottoman rule". Much of the information about Bayezid's campaigns in 1390–1391 comes from the letters written by the Byzantine emperor Manuel II Palaiologos, who accompanied Bayezid as his vassal.|$|E
2500|$|Shamrock {{engaged in}} a feud with Don Frye during {{his career in the}} Pride Fighting Championships, whose {{background}} was Don Frye's trash talking. In 1999, Alicia Webb (also known as Ryan Shamrock) dated Ken Shamrock until early 2003. Frye made comments to the effect that Shamrock cheated on and divorced his wife to date a young girl (Alicia Webb was 19 and Ken Shamrock was 35 when they started dating). Frye also joked that Ken's (at the time) estranged father Bob and brother Frank would be in Frye's corner for the fight. Ken Shamrock was enraged by Frye's trash talk, causing a feud between Shamrock and Frye. Since then, Frye has stated that he only resorted to personal trash talk to make Ken want to fight him. Frye said: [...] "I saw Ken Shamrock whoop him (Dan Severn) at UFC 6 and I thought, [...] "That's a guy I gotta fight. Anybody who can whoop Dan Severn like that has gotta be a man and I want to test my size against his size. I had the chance to talk trash and they gave me the fight; <b>I</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> line. I wasn't professional about it, but Ken was and after the fight, we shook hands and went our separate ways." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior {{to public}} release, Meirelles {{screened}} Blindness to test audiences. He described {{the impact of}} test screenings: [...] "If {{you know how to}} use it, how to ask the right questions, it can be really useful." [...] A test screening of Meirelles' first cut in Toronto resulted in ten percent of the audience, nearly 50 people, walking out of the film early. Meirelles ascribed the problem to a rape scene that takes place partway through the film, and edited the scene to be much shorter in the final cut. Meirelles explained his goal, [...] "When I shot and edited these scenes, I did it in a very technical way, I worried about how to light it and so on, and I lost the sense of their brutality. Some women were really angry with the film, and I thought, 'Wow, maybe <b>I</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> line.' I went back not to please the audience but so they would stay involved {{until the end of the}} story." [...] He also found that a New York City test screening expressed concern about a victim in the film failing to take revenge. Meirelles believed this concern to reflect what Americans have learned to expect in their cinema.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Bourguiba {{settled in}} the bourgeois {{neighborhood}} of Tourbet el Bey, in the medina of Tunis, where his brother M'hamed rented a housing on Korchani Street. Interpreter at the State section, he was often off to work or studying in the Khaldounia, aiming to prepare {{the first half of}} the French baccalaureate. This left Habib with Dhaouia, M'hamed's servant who made Habib her domestic She made him do household chores or buy groceries and took him with her whenever she went visiting families in order to select a suitable wife for M'hamed. At the start of the 1907 school year, his brother enrolled him in the Sadiki elementary school. The superintendent described him as turbulent but studious. The young Habib had to perfect Quran learnings, that being the main lessons taught. That made him spend weekends studying and learning Quran with his brother Mahmoud, shouting and screaming being Mahmoud's teaching method. [...] "To go to school", he recalled, [...] "I had to go by foot. Leaving the house where I lived and which belonged to the grandfather of Tahar Lakhdar, <b>I</b> <b>crossed</b> <b>the</b> souks and climbed the hill of Sidi Ben Arous. I was poorly dressed. My shoes had holes which filled with water. By pride, I refused to ask my older brother to buy me a new pair. That was my life throughout my primary education". The Husainid family members being the only ones allowed to take lunch inside the school, Bourguiba had to go home and eat Dhaouia's ratatouilles that did not put an end to his hunger. It was only during the 1911 epidemic of Cholera which killed M'hamed's wife, that he was able to eat his fill, thanks to the Couscous destined for guests, narrowly avoiding starvation.|$|E
