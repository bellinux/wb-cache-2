5|$|Waxwings can eat {{huge numbers}} of berries, each bird {{sometimes}} consuming several hundred a day, more than double its own weight. One individual was recorded as eating between 600 and 1,000 cotoneaster berries in six hours, and defecating every four minutes. Waxwings travel significant distances when feeding and help to disperse the <b>fruit</b> <b>seeds.</b> Waxwings forage in large flocks, sometimes of several hundred birds, which enables them to overwhelm birds such as mistle thrushes attempting to defend their fruit trees.|$|E
5|$|Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, the yellow-faced honeyeater {{is thought}} to have adapted to a mixed diet. Its diet {{consists}} of nectar, pollen, <b>fruit,</b> <b>seeds,</b> honeydew, and insects. It is arboreal, foraging primarily among the foliage and flowers of trees, shrubs, and mistletoes, less often on branches and tree trunk, and rarely on the ground. Yellow-faced honeyeaters feed on nectar around 40% of the time, and on insects around 60% of the time. The yellow-faced honeyeater feeds on insects by gleaning, and by sallying or catching insects in flight or probing in bark crevices. The insects eaten are primarily Diptera (flies, mosquitoes, maggots, gnats, and midges), beetles and spiders. A study of the pollen on the bills and foreheads of captured birds found that 70% carried pollen from silver banksia (Banksia marginata), 61% from heath-leaved banksia (Banksia ericifolia), and 22% carried pollen from other plants in the area including fern-leaved banksia (Banksia oblongifolia), mountain devil (Lambertia formosa) and green spider flower (Grevillea mucronulata).|$|E

25|$|In Greece, rodents, insects, carrion, {{and fruits}} {{comprise}} the jackal’s diet, though they rarely eat garbage, due to {{large numbers of}} stray dogs preventing them access to places with high human density. Jackals in Turkey {{have been known to}} eat the eggs of the endangered green sea-turtle. In Hungary, their most frequent prey are common voles and bank voles. In Dalmatia, mammals (the majority being even-toed ungulates and lagomorphs) made up 50.3% of the golden jackal's diet, <b>fruit</b> <b>seeds</b> (14% each being common fig and common grape vine, while 4.6% are Juniperus oxycedrus) and vegetables 34.1%, insects (16% orthopteras, 12% beetles, and 3% dictyopteras) 29.5%, birds and their eggs 24.8%, artificial food 24%, and branches, leaves, and grass 24%. Information on the diet of jackals in North-Eastern Italy is scant, but it is certain that they prey on small roe deer and hares.|$|E
25|$|The {{goal of the}} {{missions}} was, above all, to become self-sufficient in relatively short order. Farming, therefore, {{was the most important}} industry of any mission. Barley, maize, and wheat were among the most common crops grown. Cereal grains were dried and ground by stone into flour. Even today, California is well known for the abundance and many varieties of fruit trees that are cultivated throughout the state. The only fruits indigenous to the region, however, consisted of wild berries or grew on small bushes. Spanish missionaries brought <b>fruit</b> <b>seeds</b> over from Europe, many of which had been introduced from Asia following earlier expeditions to the continent; orange, grape, apple, peach, pear, and fig seeds were among the most prolific of the imports. Grapes were also grown and fermented into wine for sacramental use and again, for trading. The specific variety, called the Criolla or Mission grape, was first planted at Mission San Juan Capistrano in 1779; in 1783, the first wine produced in Alta California emerged from the mission's winery. Ranching also became an important mission industry as cattle and sheep herds were raised.|$|E

500|$|Carl Ludwig Willdenow {{coined the}} name Aiphanes in 1801. Before that, species {{belonging}} to the genus {{had been placed in}} Bactris or Caryota. [...] The name Martinezia had also been applied to the genus, and between 1847 and 1932 it was generally used in place of Aiphanes. Max Burret resurrected the name Aiphanes in 1932, and laid the basis for the modern concept of the genus. [...] Aiphanes is most closely related to several other genera of spiny palms—Acrocomia, Astrocaryum, Bactris and Desmoncus.

2500|$|Paleolithic {{hunting and}} {{gathering}} people ate varying proportions of vegetables (including tubers and roots), <b>fruit,</b> <b>seeds</b> (including nuts and wild grass seeds) and insects, meat, fish, and shellfish. However, there is little direct evidence of the relative proportions {{of plant and animal}} foods. Although the term [...] "paleolithic diet", without references to a specific timeframe or locale, is sometimes used with an implication that most humans shared a certain diet during the entire era, that is not entirely accurate. The Paleolithic was an extended period of time, during which multiple technological advances were made, many of which had impact on human dietary structure. For example, humans probably did not possess the control of fire until the Middle Paleolithic, or tools necessary to engage in extensive fishing. On the other hand, both these technologies are generally agreed to have been widely available to humans {{by the end of the}} Paleolithic (consequently, allowing humans in some regions of the planet to rely heavily on fishing and hunting). In addition, the Paleolithic involved a substantial geographical expansion of human populations. During the Lower Paleolithic, ancestors of modern humans are thought to have been constrained to Africa east of the Great Rift Valley. During the Middle and Upper Paleolithic, humans greatly expanded their area of settlement, reaching ecosystems as diverse as New Guinea and Alaska, and adapting their diets to whatever local resources were available.|$|E

Pongamia-based biodiesel development program is still constrained by the availability of quality and quantity seeds due to the limited of seed sources. The purpose of this research was to identify the morphological diversity of <b>fruits,</b> <b>seeds</b> and seedlings from 5 populations in Java Island. Randomized completely design and randomized block design were used to assess the difference of <b>fruits,</b> <b>seeds</b> and seedlings morphological characteristics among populations.

Seeds from Carita population showed good quality seed indicators with moisture content of 19. 31 %, and germination capacity of 74. 50 %. Sturdiness quotient of the seedling was 10. 78.
