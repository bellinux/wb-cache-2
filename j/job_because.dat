5|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) orders Darryl to hire {{replacements}} for the warehouse staff, but Darryl is wallowing in his depression and neglects to {{even look at}} the applications. With an order due out for one of Phyllis Vance's (Phyllis Smith) most important clients, Andy asks for volunteers to step in {{for the day and}} make sure that the order is shipped out. Jim, Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper), Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), and Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) take over the process, (however, in a talking-head interview, Kevin states that he will deliberately do a poor <b>job</b> <b>because</b> he did not volunteer and was merely suggested for the <b>job</b> <b>because</b> of his large size), but {{do not know how to}} use the heavy-lifting equipment and balk at the notion of carrying all the heavy boxes by hand. Upon Kevin's suggestion, they create an oil luge to slide the boxes across the floor resulting in a lot of damaged inventory. They retool Kevin's idea throughout the day, resulting in still more damaged inventory, and Phyllis ultimately loses the client.|$|E

5|$|Charlie Bucket (Freddie Highmore) is a {{kind and}} loving boy living in poverty with his parents (Noah Taylor and Helena Bonham Carter) and four {{bedridden}} grandparents. They all rely on his father for income, employed at a toothpaste factory, responsible for putting the caps on the tubes. However, Mr. Bucket eventually loses his <b>job</b> <b>because</b> the factory replaced him with a machine that puts the caps on the tubes. Down the street is Willy Wonka's (Johnny Depp) chocolate factory, which reopened after industrial espionage forced him into seclusion and sacking his employees. Charlie's Grandpa Joe (David Kelly) worked for Wonka before the termination.|$|E

5|$|Two {{days after}} the Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) program, Insane Clown Posse began its rescheduled {{nationwide}} tour with House of Krazees and Myzery. Their first concert, held in Orlando, Florida, was hand-picked by Insane Clown Posse and free to the public. Halfway through the tour, Brian Jones of House of Krazees had a falling out with his band members. Jones left the group, forcing House of Krazees to quit the tour. The success of the tour enabled Bruce and Utsler to purchase new houses both {{for each other and}} for their families. Bruce even told his mother to quit her <b>job</b> <b>because</b> he would pay her expenses.|$|E
5|$|Victory in the 1984 Portuguese Cup final ensured Porto's {{return to}} the Cup Winners' Cup in 1984–85, but they were {{surprisingly}} knocked {{out in the first}} round by Welsh Cup runners-up Wrexham. In January 1985, having left his <b>job</b> <b>because</b> of health problems, Pedroto died; he was succeeded by his apprentice Artur Jorge. Porto won the 1984–85 Primeira Liga and qualified for the 1985–86 European Cup, where they first beat an Ajax side guided by Johan Cruyff and featuring Ronald Koeman, Frank Rijkaard and Marco van Basten. Porto then faced Barcelona in the second round; after a 2–0 loss at Camp Nou, Juary scored all three goals of Porto's 3–1 win, which was insufficient to avoid elimination on the away goals rule.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, she {{returned}} to India {{in the wake of}} the economic recession and moved to Mumbai to stay with Priyanka. During a visit to Yash Raj Films studio, Priyanka (who was filming for Pyaar Impossible!) introduced Parineeti to the head of the public relations team of the company. Chopra obtained an internship in the marketing department, joining the production company as a public-relations consultant. She considered it a perfect <b>job,</b> <b>because</b> she could use what she had learned and work in films. Chopra had disliked actors and acting; to her, the profession seemed like an excuse to wear too much makeup. This changed when she observed Priyanka's preparations for her role in 7 Khoon Maaf (2011), which highly influenced her and changed her perception towards acting and actors. Once she learnt more about filmmaking, her respect for the profession increased.|$|E

25|$|Austin's {{decision}} to go into politics was partially motivated by his belief that the BC Liberal government had a lack of concern {{for people in the}} Northwest who were affected by the economic downturn {{at the beginning of the}} millennium.

25|$|Freud {{gave her}} the name 'Dora', and he {{describes}} in detail in The Psychopathology of Everyday Life what his unconscious motivations for choosing such a name might have been. His sister's nursemaid {{had to give up}} her real name, Rosa, when she accepted the <b>job</b> <b>because</b> Freud's sister was also named Rosa—she took the name 'Dora' instead. Thus, when Freud needed a name for someone who could not keep her real name (this time, in order to preserve his patient's anonymity), Dora was the name that occurred to him.|$|E
25|$|The {{effects of}} such high incarceration rates are also shown in other ways. For example, {{a woman who has}} been {{recently}} released from prison is ineligible for welfare in most states. She is not eligible for subsidized housing, and for Section 8 she has to wait two years before she can apply. In addition to finding housing, she also has to find employment, but most likely she can not find a <b>job</b> <b>because</b> she has a criminal record so no one wants to hire her. Essentially, a woman who has been recently released from prison comes into a society that is not prepared structurally or emotionally to welcome her back.|$|E

30|$|If {{employee}} {{discrimination against}} women increases with the proportion of men working in the job, employers tailor their offers to the group from which they can hire more workers. Women place a smaller value on higher-productivity <b>jobs</b> <b>because</b> of the greater working-hour requirements and the disutility from the higher concentration of men. Conversely, women place a greater value on lower-productivity <b>jobs</b> <b>because</b> of the shorter hours and the amenity from the higher fraction of females. Consequently, higher-productivity jobs are tailored more toward the working-hour preferences of men, and lower-productivity jobs are tailored more toward those of women. Therefore, segregation is reinforced.|$|R

25|$|Around 1910 Cain {{joined the}} Victorian Socialist Party (VSP), a Marxist {{party to the}} left of the Australian Labor Party (although like most VSP members Cain was {{probably}} also an ALP member at the time). In 1915 he became an organiser with the Theatrical Employees' Union, and in 1916 he became a clerk in the Defence Department. He was sacked from this <b>job</b> <b>because</b> of his opposition to conscription for World War I, and became an organiser with the Clothing Trades Union. From 1915 to 1927 he was a Labor member of the Northcote City Council. In 1921 when many VSP members joined the new Communist Party of Australia, Cain broke his connections with the left and became a mainstream Labor politician.|$|E
25|$|In 1959, Sondheim was {{approached}} by Laurents and Robbins for a musical version of Gypsy Rose Lee's memoir after Irving Berlin and Cole Porter turned it down. Sondheim agreed, but Ethel Merman – cast as Mama Rose – had just finished Happy Hunting with an unknown composer (Harold Karr) and lyricist (Matt Dubey). Although Sondheim wanted to write the music and lyrics, Merman refused to let another first-time composer write for her and demanded that Jule Styne write the music. Sondheim, concerned that writing lyrics again would pigeonhole him as a lyricist, called his mentor for advice. Hammerstein told him he should take the <b>job,</b> <b>because</b> writing a vehicle for a star {{would be a good}} learning experience. Sondheim agreed; Gypsy opened on May 21, 1959, and ran for 702 performances.|$|E
25|$|Not {{only have}} {{employees}} {{lost their jobs}} in the United States, but it has happened with social network users internationally. In April 2011, a Lloyd's banking group employee in the United Kingdom was fired for making a sarcastic post about the higher salary of her boss in relation to hers. In February 2013 there was another case where a flight attendant working for a Russian airline lost her <b>job</b> <b>because</b> she posted a photo of herself giving the middle finger to a plane full of passengers. The photo went viral exposing {{it all over the}} Internet. In November 2009, a woman working for IBM in Quebec, Canada, lost her company's health insurance benefits because she posted photos displaying her mental health problem. The company decided to cut her benefits because it was costing them additional funds.|$|E

50|$|Lower {{unemployment}} rates were another {{large part of}} Clinton’s macroeconomic policies. Many argue that Clinton cost many Americans <b>jobs</b> <b>because</b> he supported free trade, which some argue caused the U.S. to lose jobs to countries like China (Burns and Taylor 390). Even if Clinton did cost Americans some <b>jobs</b> <b>because</b> of free trade support, he allowed for more jobs than were lost because the unemployment rate of his presidency, and especially his second term, were the lowest {{they had been in}} thirty years (Burns and Taylor 390). Others attribute this to sustained declines in interest rates, which fueled a booming stock market and job growth in a booming technology sector.|$|R
25|$|Originally from England, Trevena has a {{background}} in journalism having worked as a Canadian correspondent for British media. After she immigrated, she worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation {{and then as a}} public information officer for the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe. After moving to British Columbia with her husband, she started her own business specializing communication strategies. She unsuccessfully {{filed a complaint with the}} British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal after being fired from a <b>job</b> <b>because</b> of her political affiliation. She was an advocate of renovations to the hospitals in Campbell River and Comox, opposing the health authority's plans to replace them with a new regional hospital near Courtenay. In November 2010, Trevena was one of thirteen party members to ask for a leadership convention, resulting in the resignation of Carole James as leader of the BC NDP. She endorsed John Horgan in both the 2011 and 2014 leadership elections.|$|E
25|$|Rav Scheinberg {{was born}} in Ostrov, Poland, the second son of Rabbi Yaakov Yitzchok Scheinberg and Yuspa (Yosefa) Tamback. He {{was born in}} his father's absence, as earlier that year, his father had left his wife and firstborn son Avraham Nosson to go to America to avoid {{conscription}} into the Polish army. Though he planned to work and send money back home, his father was fired from job after <b>job</b> <b>because</b> he refused {{to work on the}} Jewish Sabbath. Soon he did not have enough money to rent a room, and spent months sleeping on New York City's East River Drive with a pillow, a blanket, and an umbrella. Meanwhile, his mother, who had moved in with her parents, also struggled to make ends meet, milking cows at dawn for Polish farmers. With the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the family lost contact. By 1919, the family patriarch had saved enough money to open his own tailor shop and brought his wife and children to America.|$|E
25|$|Casting {{announcements}} {{began in}} February 2012, when Kristin Kreuk was first {{cast in the}} lead role of Catherine Chandler. Austin Basis was then cast {{in the role of}} J.T.

Anderson signed on to the recurring role of Heather Chandler, Catherine's younger sister. Jay Ryan joined the series in the second lead role, Vincent Keller (the character was originally called Vincent Koslow, though in the original series, Vincent had no last name). Max Brown signed on for the role of Dr. Evan Marks, a medical examiner who has feelings for Catherine. Brian White was the last actor to sign onto the series. White joined in the role of Joe Bishop, Catherine and Tess' commanding officer at the NYPD, who becomes romantically involved with Tess. White's character of Joe Bishop {{was not included in the}} second season of the series; the story line was that Bishop lost his <b>job</b> <b>because</b> he focused too much attention on finding the killer of his brother instead of performing his duties.|$|E
