5|$|Taaramäe took fourth overall at Paris–Nice in March, {{winning the}} youth {{classification}} with this performance, which was easily the strongest for an Estonian rider in the event's history. Taaramäe {{turned in a}} similar strong ride at the two-day, three-stage Critérium International, finishing on the event's final podium in third place, and securing the youth classification. At the concurrent Volta a Catalunya, Dumoulin took two stage wins. The first was in stage 5, on an uphill false flat finish which Dumoulin felt suited him well. The second was more unexpected, {{in that it was}} a <b>dead</b> <b>flat</b> run in to the finish on wide roads, a more traditional field sprint. Dumoulin was delighted to win twice in front of some of the sport's biggest stars, and stated that his next goal would be a major spring classic, perhaps the Amstel Gold Race. Dumoulin, however, was not a factor at the Amstel, finishing 104th, over eight minutes behind the winner.|$|E
500|$|On September 9, {{two days}} before the Iraq {{commanding}} General David Petraeus addressed the Senate, Biden stated that, [...] "I really respect him, and I think he's <b>dead</b> <b>flat</b> wrong [...] ". He criticized the president, arguing, [...] "This president has no plan – how to win and/or how to leave". During the September 11 testimony by the General, Biden stated that the question to be asked to determine progress was [...] "Are we any closer to a lasting political settlement in Iraq at the national level today than we were when the surge began eight months ago?" [...] He answered his own question by stating [...] "In my judgment, I must tell you, based on my experience and my observation here, as well as in-country, the answer to... questions is no." [...] After the testimony concluded, Biden and other Democrats were criticized for their conduct during the deliberations. In the following weeks Biden would continue with these arguments while campaigning.|$|E
2500|$|The {{plan was}} also vociferously criticized from the start, {{not the least}} {{because it did not}} take into account the natural {{topography}} of the island, but also because it took no notice of classical ideas about beauty, and was monotonous in its regularity. It was also lambasted for being made in service of monetary interests alone. Among the many critics of the plan were Edgar Allan Poe and Alexis de Toqueville who believed that it fostered [...] "relentless monotony." [...] Walt Whitman, the poet and editor of The Brooklyn Eagle, said of it: [...] "Our perpetual <b>dead</b> <b>flat</b> and streets cutting each other at right angles, are certainly the last thing in the world consistent with beauty of situation." ...|$|E

Observe, however, {{before going}} farther, {{of all the}} {{painters}} we have named, the one who obtains most executive perfection is Leonardo, who on the whole lived at the greatest distance from the hills. The two who have most feeling are Giotto and Angelico, both hill-bred. And generally, I believe, we shall find that the hill country gives its inventive depths of feeling to art, as {{in the work of}} Orcagna, Perugino, and Angelico, and the plain country executive neatness. The executive precision is joined with feeling in Leonardo, who saw the Alps in the distance; it is totally unaccompanied by feeling in the pure Dutch schools, or schools of the <b>dead</b> <b>flats.</b>|$|R

60|$|This {{was the end}} {{of their}} talk, and Eustacia left him. Clym watched her as she retired towards the sun. The {{luminous}} rays wrapped her up with her increasing distance, and the rustle of her dress over the sprouting sedge and grass died away. As he watched, the <b>dead</b> <b>flat</b> of the scenery overpowered him, though he was fully alive to the beauty of that untarnished early summer green which was worn for the nonce by the poorest blade. There was something in its oppressive horizontality which too much reminded him of the arena of life; it gave him a sense of bare equality with, and no superiority to, a single living thing under the sun.|$|E

Whatever beauty, (thought I,) may be before the poet's eyes at present, it must certainly be purely of his own creation.

The servants and some of the spare rooms are on the second floor, and all the living rooms are on the ground floor.

And thither, unto Malepartus safe and strong, trots Reinecke, where he hopes to be snug among the labyrinthine windings, and innumerable starting-holes, as the old apologue has it, of his ballium, covert-way, and donjon keep.

"I {{mean that}} the accent, inflection, {{and quality of the}} ghost's voice were {{identical}} with that of the living man, and this became still more striking when, a little later, Jacob returned to his seat, and the 'Count,' his visitor, called for the Polish national hymn. Jacob then sang, and the phantom sang with him. Now this seemed like a clear case of identification, and was perfectly satisfactory to Jacob, but I had observed this fact: the Pole was an indifferent singer--having hard work to keep the key--and the 'Count' was troubled in the same way. His deep, almost toneless, singing struck me as a <b>dead,</b> <b>flat,</b> wooden echo of Jacob's voice. In short, {{it was as if the}} psychic had built up a personality partly out of himself, but mainly out of his Polish sitter, and as if this etheric duplication were singing in unison with its progenitor." ...|$|E

60|$|And {{this point}} about the water brings me at last to a {{cardinal}} fact in the constitution of deserts which is almost always utterly misconceived in Europe.

But, {{as a matter of}} fact, that uniform and lifeless desert of the popular fancy exists only in those sister arts that George II.--good, practical man--so heartily despised, 'boetry and bainting.' The desert of real life, though less impressive, is far more varied. It has its ups and downs, its hills and valleys. It has its sandy plains and its rocky ridges. It has its lakes and ponds, and even its rivers. It has its plants and animals, its oases and palm-groves. In short, like everything else on earth, it's a good deal more complex than people imagine.|$|E

This at the first faint dawn of morning they left, and took refuge in a thick grove a quarter of a mile from the highway. Before throwing themselves down to rest, the girls, at Ned's earnest request, tried to eat a piece of biscuit, but tried in vain, they, however, each sipped a little wine from the bottles, and then, utterly worn out and exhausted, soon forgot their misery in a deep and heavy sleep.|$|E
