50|$|Most modern {{engines are}} {{equipped}} with fuel injection, and have an electric submersible <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> in the <b>fuel</b> tank. Moving the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> to {{the interior of the}} tank helps prevent vapor lock, since the entire fuel delivery system is under positive pressure and the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> runs cooler than if it is located in the engine compartment. This is the primary reason that vapor lock is rare in modern fuel systems. For the same reason, some carbureted engines are retrofitted with an electric <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> near the <b>fuel</b> tank.|$|R

50|$|As engines {{moved away}} from carburetors and towards fuel injection, {{mechanical}} <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> were replaced with electric <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps,</b> because <b>fuel</b> injection systems operate more efficiently at higher fuel pressures (40-60 psi) than mechanical diaphragm pumps can generate. Electric <b>fuel</b> <b>pumps</b> are generally located in the fuel tank, {{in order to use}} the fuel in the tank to cool the pump and to ensure a steady supply of fuel.|$|R

50|$|In the APU, a <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> {{boosted the}} {{hydrazine}} pressure and fed it to a gas generator. The gas generator catalytically decomposed the hydrazine into hot, high-pressure gas; a two-stage turbine converted this into mechanical power, driving a gearbox. The waste gas, now cooler and at low pressure, was passed {{back over the}} gas generator housing to cool it before being dumped overboard. The gearbox drove the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump,</b> its own lubrication pump, and the HPU hydraulic pump. As described so far, the system could not self-start, since the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> was driven by the turbine it supplied fuel to. Accordingly, a bypass line went around the pump and fed the gas generator using the nitrogen tank pressure until the APU speed was such that the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump</b> outlet pressure exceeded that of the bypass line, at which point all the fuel was supplied to the <b>fuel</b> <b>pump.</b>|$|R
50|$|In piston {{aircraft}} engines, continuous-flow {{fuel injection}} {{is the most}} common type. In contrast to automotive fuel injection systems, aircraft continuous flow fuel injection is all mechanical, requiring no electricity to operate. Two common types exist: the Bendix RSA system, and the TCM system. The Bendix system is a direct descendant of the pressure carburetor. However, instead of having a discharge valve in the barrel, it uses a flow divider mounted on top of the engine, which controls the discharge rate and evenly distributes the fuel to stainless steel injection lines to the intake ports of each cylinder. The TCM system is even more simple. It has no venturi, no pressure chambers, no diaphragms, and no discharge valve. The control unit is fed by a constant-pressure <b>fuel</b> <b>pump.</b> The control <b>unit</b> simply uses a butterfly valve for the air, which is linked by a mechanical linkage to a rotary valve for the fuel. Inside the control unit is another restriction, which controls the fuel mixture. The pressure drop across the restrictions in the control unit controls the amount of fuel flow, so that fuel flow is directly proportional to the pressure at the flow divider. In fact, most aircraft that use the TCM fuel injection system feature a fuel flow gauge that is actually a pressure gauge calibrated in gallons per hour or pounds per hour of fuel.|$|R
