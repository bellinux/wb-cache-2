Conclusion. Parental {{decisions of}} bilingual child-rearing {{are influenced by}} prevailing language ideologies and popular discourses on the advantages of bilingualism. This study seeks to explore the ideologies underpinning parental decisions on family language policies in a predominantly English monolingual environment. Focussing on how the notion of 'good' parenting is linked to bilingualism as a child-rearing strategy, the discursive construction of bilingual parenting is explored {{in one of the}} largest online parenting communities in Australia, essentialbaby. com. au, using critical discourse analysis. This is a 'mainstream' forum that is not a priori concerned with language. The corpus consists of 15 discussion threads totalling 266 comments posted between 2007 and 2014 by parents and carers seeking and giving advice on bilingual child-rearing. Findings suggest that due to the increasing valorisation of bilingualism in general discourses, bilingual family language policies, such as the 'one parent - one language' strategy, have beome incorporated into mainstream parenting strategies. Overall, this study finds that parents are often faced with contradictory bilingual child-rearing realities that inform their language-related parenting decisions. The research extends existing literature on how the monolingual mindset operates on an individual level, and has implications for language policy at individual, <b>institutionl</b> <b>and</b> state levels.

Methods We performed a systematic review of literature about the role <b>and</b> the potentiality <b>of</b> morphological <b>and</b> functional MRI in prostate cancer, also in a multimodal / multiparametric approach, and we reported the diagnostic accuracy results for different imaging modalities and for different MR coil settings: endorectal coil (ERC) and phased array coil (PAC). Forest plots and receiver operating characteristic curves were performed. Risk <b>of</b> bias <b>and</b> the applicability at study level were calculated. Results Thirty three papers were identified for the systematic review. Sensitivity and specificity values were, respectively, for T 2 -MRI <b>of</b> 75 % <b>and</b> <b>of</b> 60 %, for DCE-MRI <b>of</b> 80 % <b>and</b> <b>of</b> 72 %, for MRSI <b>of</b> 89 % <b>and</b> <b>of</b> 69 %, for combined T 2 -MRI <b>and</b> DCE-MRI <b>of</b> 87 % <b>and</b> <b>of</b> 46 %, for combined T 2 -MRI <b>and</b> MRSI <b>of</b> 79 % <b>and</b> <b>of</b> 57 %, for combined T 2 -MRI, DWI <b>and</b> DCE-MRI <b>of</b> 81 % <b>and</b> <b>of</b> 84 %, <b>and</b> for combined MRSI <b>and</b> DCE-MRI <b>of</b> 83 % <b>and</b> <b>of</b> 83 %. For MRI studies performed with ERC we obtained a pooled sensitivity <b>and</b> specificity <b>of</b> 81 % <b>and</b> <b>of</b> 66 % while the pooled values for MRI studies performed with PAC were <b>of</b> 78 % <b>and</b> <b>of</b> 64 %, respectively (p> 0. 05 at McNemar test). No studies {{were excluded from the}} analysis based on the quality assessment. Conclusions ERC use yielded no additional benefit in terms of prostate cancer detection accuracy compared to multi-channel PAC use (71 % versus 68 %) while the use of additional functional imaging techniques (DCE-MRI, DWI and MRSI) in a multiparametric MRI protocol improves the accuracy of prostate cancer detection allowing both the early cure <b>and</b> the guidance <b>of</b> biopsy...|$|R
