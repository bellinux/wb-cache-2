40|$|Multilayer ceramic {{capacitors}} (MLCCs) {{are known}} to be susceptible to cracking when subjected to excessive printed circuit board (PCB) flexure, which is called "flex cracking". The bending of the printed circuit board causes stresses to be transmitted through the solder fillets to the surface mount capacitors. These stresses are the highest {{at the bottom of the}} capacitor, where the termination bands end. In order to reduce the amount of stress that is transmitted to the brittle ceramic body of MLCCs through end terminations, a flexible termination system which incorporates a silver-loaded epoxy in end-terminations was developed by some MLCC manufacturers. With the transition to lead-free materials in the electronics industry there is a concern that MLCCs assembled on PCBs with lead-free solder have different susceptibility to <b>flex</b> <b>cracking</b> than those assembled with eutectic tin-lead solder. In this study, the <b>flex</b> <b>cracking</b> of MLCCs assembled with lead-free solder (Sn 3. 0 Ag 0. 5 Cu) was compared with those assembled with eutectic tin-lead (Sn 37 Pb) solder and differences in the results were explained in terms of solder mechanical properties and solder solidification temperature. Tin-silver-copper lead-free solders and eutectic tin-lead solder have different mechanical properties, which affect the stresses that are transmitted to the ceramic body of the capacitor through the solder fillet. The higher solidification temperature for lead-free solder leads to increased residual compressive stresses after the reflow cool-down process for MLCCs assembled with lead-free solder compared with those assembled with tin-lead solder. In this work, the effects of dielectric material, capacitor size, solder assembly process, solder material, and end-termination type on <b>flex</b> <b>cracking</b> of MLCCs were determined for MLCCs from different manufacturers. Since some flexible- and standard-termination MLCCs are made with precious metal electrodes (silver-palladium), there is a possibility of electrochemical silver migration under bias and humidity. In this study, the effects of temperature-humidity-bias on electrical parameters of flexible-termination MLCCs were characterized and compared with standard-termination MLCCs. In addition, the effect of temperature-humidity-bias on electrical parameters of MLCCs with base metal electrodes was compared to that for precious metal electrode capacitors...|$|E

40|$|Multilayer ceramic {{capacitors}} (MLCCs) {{are subjected}} to high strain rate flexural loading via drop tower and air gun tests, with PWB strain rates ranging from 1 /s to 10 /s. Three MLCC part sizes, three different manufacturers, and standard and flexible termination parts {{are included in the}} study. Standard termination capacitors failed via the well documented <b>flex</b> <b>crack</b> failure mechanism. However in all cases this crack followed a vertical path not typical of this failure mechanism. Flexible termination capacitors failed via a newly discovered failure mechanism involving delamination in the end cap metallization between the silver filled epoxy and the nickel-tin plating. For size 1206 parts, this delamination was seen in both end caps, and the part detached from the test board. For size 0603 parts, this delamination occurred in one end cap, while the opposite end cap fractured though the ceramic {{in a manner similar to}} a <b>flex</b> <b>crack.</b> Size 0603 parts also failed via the vertical <b>flex</b> <b>cracks</b> documented in standard termination parts. All of the documented failures of MLCC devices at PWB strain rates of ≥ 1 /s occurred at maximum PWB strain values greater than an order of magnitude lower than those seen in lower strain rate testing. This rate dependency of MLCC part failures has vast implications for products intended for high rate environments. Additionally, when the PWB strain rate was increased along with PWB maximum strain, flexible termination capacitors performed worse than their standard termination equivalents. This brings to issue the role of these next generation parts in portable consumer electronic devices as well as other designs with high rate implications.

40|$|Flexible {{termination}} capacitors {{were designed}} to reduce stresses transmitted to the ceramic dielectric of a capacitor and thereby prevent <b>flex</b> <b>cracking.</b> Two studies were conducted to examine the reliability of flexible termination multilayer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs) subjected to environmental stresses. The first study used temperature-humidity-bias to compare the effects of termination type (standard vs. flexible), presence of a conformal coating (acrylic coating vs. no coating), and voltage bias level. In situ monitoring demonstrated similar failure statistics between the flexible and standard termination capacitors, presence of conformal coating, and voltage bias level. Upon removal from THB conditions recovery occurred only in the standard termination MLCCs. Flexible termination capacitors at the rated voltage bias {{were found to have}} more permanent failures after exposure to THB testing as compared to standard termination capacitors. Failure analysis indicated that silver and palladium migration between electrodes was the failure mechanism in the biased flexible termination capacitors. In the second study flexible and standard termination MLCCs experienced a storage test in which they were exposed to elevated temperature and humidity conditions. It was found that the standard termination MLCCs had a lower reliability with the majority of the MLCCs failing compared to the flexible termination MLCCs where only one MLCC failed. Nearly all failures were for insulation resistance with few capacitors failing for other parameters. Subsequent bake-out of the MLCCs showed some recovery, however more failures were still occurring in the standard termination MLCCs compared to the flexible termination MLCCs.

To improve {{the performance of}} rubber compounds, three types of locally available mineral fillers; kaolin, kaolinite and quartz were modified through ion-exchange process and used as reinforcing fillers. The clays were thus modified with three types of organic quaternary ammonium ions. They were thiourium, ammonium succinimate and para ammino phenolate. Sieve fractionating and sedimentation analysis were performed to find the particle size distribution of the tested fillers. Cation exchange capacities of tested fillers were determined using Kjedhal experiment. Obtained results were used to perform the ion-exchange reaction keeping stoicheometrically balanced ratios of modifying exchangeable cations and kaolins Modified and unmodified fillers were compounded with rubber. Physico -mechanical properties of rubber compounds such as tensile, aging, resistance to <b>flex</b> <b>cracking,</b> crack growth, and abrasion were determined and analyzed. To evaluate the interaction of rubber with filler surface bound rubber content and swelling tests were performed. Differential Thermal Analysis (DTA) and Differential Thermal Gravimetric Analysis (DTG) were used to confirm the course of ion-exchange reaction. Microphotographs were taken to evaluate the quality of dispersion and distribution of fillers in rubber compounds. Obtained results demonstrated advantages of rubber compounds filled with modified fillers. Better performance was achieved on account of improved compatibility and intensified interaction of modified fillers with rubber. It was found that reinforcing effect introduced to rubber by thiourium cations modified clay was especially strong. Proposed mechanism of reinforcement of rubber with thiourium cations modified clay referred to formation of chemical links across rubber-filler interface.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} presents {{three separate}} studies that examined electronic components using numerical modeling approaches. The use of modeling techniques provided {{a deeper understanding}} of the physical phenomena that contribute to the formation of cracks inside ceramic capacitors, damage inside plated through holes, and to dynamic fracture of MEMS structures. The modeling yielded numerical substantiations for previously proposed theoretical explanations. Multi-Layer Ceramic Capacitors (MLCCs) mounted with stiffer lead-free solder have shown greater tolerance than tin-lead solder for single cycle board bending loads with low strain rates. In contrast, flexible terminations have greater tolerance than stiffer standard terminations under the same conditions. It has been proposed that residual stresses in the capacitor account for this disparity. These stresses have been attributed to the higher solidification temperature of lead free solders coupled with the CTE mismatch between the board and the capacitor ceramic. This research indicated that the higher solidification temperatures affected the residual stresses. Inaccuracies in predicting barrel failures of plated through holes are suspected to arise from neglecting the effects of the reflow process on the copper material. This research used thermo mechanical analysis (TMA) results to model the damage in the copper above the glass transition temperature (Tg) during reflow. Damage estimates from the hysteresis plots were used to improve failure predictions. Modeling was performed to examine the theory that brittle fracture in MEMS structures is not affected by strain rates. Numerical modeling was conducted to predict the probability of dynamic failure caused by shock loads. The models used a quasi-static global gravitational load to predict the probability of brittle fracture. The research presented in this dissertation explored drivers for failure mechanisms in <b>flex</b> <b>cracking</b> of capacitors, barrel failures in plated through holes, and dynamic fracture of MEMS. The studies used numerical modeling to provide new insights into underlying physical phenomena. In each case, theoretical explanations were examined where difficult geometries and complex material properties made it difficult or impossible to obtain direct measurements...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The use of cellular polyurethanes either as microporous foams in shoe upper materials (poromerics) or in closed cell form as soling materials has increased rapidly {{during the last few}} years in the footwear industry. Compared with vulcanised rubbers, these materials have high strength over an extended temperature range, high set and good resistance to cut growth. The research now presented. has been concerned with determining the reasons for these mechanical properties of polyurethane as compared with compounded conventional vulcanised rubbers. The supplementary contribution to the thesis presents a review of earlier work on the strength and reinforcement of crystalline, amorphous and filled vulcanised rubbers and includes a short section on the effect of crosslinking on ultimate failure properties of natural rubber. This study has been extended by the author into the effect of chain branching in polyurethane elastomers on the failure properties. The viscoelastic properties of natural and artificial leathers are also discussed in order to demonstrate similarities between the different materials and show how a cellular polyurethane sheet has hysteresial properties similar to those of a natural material of fibrous structure. It is shown that a cubical lattice model can be applied to explain the differences between such mechanical properties as modulus, tensile and tear strength of a cellular polyurethane and the corresponding solid material of the same polymer. This model, which has previously been applied to the mechanical properties of a natural rubber latex foam, indicates that the strength of cellular polyurethanes is due to the very high strength of the solid material. An extensive investigation into the effect of time and temperature on the tensile properties of cellular and solid polyurethanes is presented in order to show that polyurethanes of the type used in poromerics have a very broad relaxation spectrum extending over 18 decades of time. Because of this response to deformation, the failure properties remain fairly constant over the temperature range from 21 – 160 °c. Above 160 °c, the tensile properties fall quite markedly. Stress softening in these polyurethanes is very high and can only be reversed by heating to temperatures above 160 °c. The cut growth and fatigue properties of cellular and solid polyurethanes are considered. Following a brief review of the investigation on cut growth and fatigue of vulcanised rubbers involving the use of tearing energy theory, it is shown that cut growth and hysteresis properties of vulcanised. rubbers can be correlated. The lower limit of tearing energy (To) below which no cut growth takes place in the absence of chemical effects is found to be higher for polyurethanes than for vulcanised rubbers. Fatigue failure of cellular polyurethanes is found to be due to cut growth from the largest pore in the sample. These data are also compared with measurements on other two phase elastomer systems such as styrene butadiene copolymer vulcanisates with high styrene content and polystyrene-polybutadiene thermoplastic rubbers. From an extensive review of the literature on the structure of polyurethane elastomers, it is deduced that polyurethanes of the type used in poromerics consist of a segmented structure of long polyester chains connected to very minute (25 Å) hard urethane segments. The cohesion of the hard segments is primarily due to hydrogen bonding and other physical forces. It is concluded that the high strength, good cut growth resistance and broad relaxation spectrum of polyurethanes are due to the reinforcement given by the hard urethane segments which act as well dispersed minute filler particles in the polyester rubber matrix. The hydrogen bonding between the hard segments dissociates at approximately 170 °c so giving a degree of thermoplasticity which produces a very high permanent set.

Cracked capacitors can manifest themselves as latent defects such as increased leakage current, intermittent opens or shorts or no problem found when field returned assemblies are analyzed. In some cases those defects can lead to catastrophic failure depending on the application and energy available. Cracks could be introduced at virtually any point in the surface mount assembly process from pick and place, soldering and assembly handling after soldering. Understanding the application, assembly process and final product configuration are necessary to eliminate capacitor cracking. Things have changed to {{change the face of}} capacitor cracking during the past two decades. Improved pick and place equipment have virtually eliminated that source of cracking as the equipment designers took capacitor cracking seriously and eliminated it as a source. Manufacturers and users of wave soldering equipment now better understand sources of thermal shock and most wave solder machines have adequate preheat control and have minimized that source of cracking except on big chips like 1812 (4. 5 x 2. 5 mm) and larger or thick chips (> 0. 050 ” or 1. 25 mm) of any case size. But what are still with us after all these years is board flexure cracking during handling, test and assembly after soldering.

40|$|Increased {{demand for}} smaller {{electronics}} {{is driving the}} electronic packaging industry to develop smaller, more efficient component level packages. Surface mounted components, such as flip chips, ball grid arrays (BGAs), and chip-scale packages (CSPs), are being developed for use in high-volume production. All of these technologies use solder bumps to attach the active silicon to the substrate, and traditional nondestructive methods such as machine vision, acoustic microscopy or x-ray inspection cannot easily find solder bump defects. Therefore, a system, consisting of an Nd:YAG laser that delivers pulses of infrared energy {{to the surface of}} the chip, a laser interferometer to record surface vibrations, and a high-speed data acquisition system to record the signals, was developed. The pulsed laser generates ultrasound on the chips surface, exciting the whole chip into a vibration motion, and the interferometer measures the vibration displacement of the chips surface at several points. Changes in the quality of the device or its attachment to the board produce changes in the free vibration response. Characterization of the differences between good devices and devices with defects, both in time domain and frequency domain, is performed using signal analysis. The system has inspected flip chips and chip scale packages for missing and misaligned solder balls, but to characterize the resolution of the system for open solder joints, a study of the vibration modes excited by the laser source in a flip chip was performed on specimens with intentionally created defects. Experimental measurements of excited modes were compared with a modal analysis model created in ANSYS, and defects were detected as small changes in the mode shape on the surface of the chips. Current inspection methods have also been inadequate for inspecting multi-layer ceramic capacitors (MLCCs). <b>Flex</b> <b>cracks,</b> caused by manufacturing processes, often cause the capacitors to fail in-service. Samples that have been cracked intentionally were compared with reference samples to determine the feasibility of using this technique to monitor the condition of MLCCs on an assembly line.

40|$|This report {{compares the}} effects of {{radiation}} and heating on nylon bagout materials used at the Savannah River Site (SRS) and the Rocky Flats Environmental Technology Site (RFETS). Recently, to simplify the processing of sand, slag, and crucible (SS and C), FB-Line has replaced the low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) bags normally used to package cans of plutonium-bearing material with nylon bags. LDPE and PVC are not soluble in the nitric acid dissolver solution used in F-Canyon, so cans bagged using these materials had to be repackaged before they {{were added to the}} dissolver. Because nylon dissolves in nitric acid, cans bagged in nylon can be charged to the F-Canyon dissolvers without repackaging, thereby reducing handling requirements and personnel exposure. As part of a program to process RFETS SS and C at SRS, RFETS has also begun to use a nylon bagout material. The RFETS bag materials is made from a copolymer of nylon 6 and nylon 6. 9, while the SRS material is made from a nylon 6 monomer. In addition, the SRS nylon has an anti-static agent added. The RFETS nylon is slightly softer than the SRS nylon, but {{does not appear to be}} as resistant to <b>flex</b> <b>cracks</b> initiated by contact with sharp corners of the inner can containing the SS and C. 2 FB-Line Operations has asked for measurement of {{the effects of}} radiation and heating on these materials. Specifically, they have requested a comparison of the material properties of the plastics before and after irradiation, a measurement of the amount of outgassing when the plastics are heated, and a calculation of the amount of radiolytic gas generation. Testing was performed on samples taken from material that is currently used in FB-Line (color coded orange) and at RFETS. The requested tests are the same tests previously performed on the original and replacement nylon and LDPE bag materials. 3, 4, 5. To evaluate the effect of irradiation on material properties, tensile stresses and elongations to break w ere compared for unirradiated and irradiated samples. A standard ASTM method for the measurement of tensile plastic properties 6 was used. Properties were measured both parallel to the direction of machining (MD) and transverse to the direction of machining (TD). Tensile strength measurements showed that the ultimate strengths of the SRS replacement bag material decreased by 22 percent in the MD orientation and 17 percent in the TD orientation after irradiation with 5 x 106 rad, a dose equivalent to about 8 - 9 months exposure in a plutonium can. For the RFETS material, the decreases were 23 percent in the MD orientation and 56 percent in the TD orientation. Although the 5 x 106 dose significantly degraded the properties of both materials, their strengths remained superior to those previously measured for LDPE, 4 even after irradiation. Elongations to break also decreased, especially for the SRS material. The decrease for the SRS material were 86 percent in the MD orientation and 95 percent in the TD orientation. For the RFETS material, elongations to break decreased at least 18 percent in the MD orientation and 29 percent in the TD orientation. When samples of both the SRS and RFETS materials were heated in a sealed container to the maximum expected storage can temperature of about 95 C, they outgassed at pressures ranging from 16 to 22 psig. These pressure increases would not cause a can to fail. Using a representative G value of 1. 6 molecules/ 100 ev, the amount of outgassing due to radiolysis was calculated to be negligible. In conclusion, it may be stated that the results of the strength tests and the outgassing measurements and calculations demonstrate that the SRS and RFETS replacement bag materials are acceptable substitutes for LDPE with respect to mechanical properties...|$|R
40|$|In this study, 10 {{pairs of}} canvas shoes with rubber soles of various trade marks were tested. The samples were iaken either from {{manufacturers}} or markets in DKI Jakarta or DIY, the test methd used was {{as stated in}} sII 1406 -g 5. The objective {{of this study is}} to compile a concept of standard for export quality canvas shoes. The test results of canvas with rubber soles can be provided as follows the portion - bursting strengrh (15, 839 - 22, 4737) kg/cm'; breaking load of shoe taces 463, 31 - & 3, 846 N; the bottom portion - the thickness of soles without treat (1, 31 - z, 7 g) mm; tensile strength (6, 25 - 11, 94) N/mm 2; elongation at break (202, 45 - 522, 93) Vo; permanent set 50 qo e, 46 - 5, 22); specific gravity (1,L 5 - 1, 29); Grasselli abrasion resistance (0, 49 - 3, 25) mmTkgm; tear strength (2, 4 g - 6, 46) N/ mm 2; <b>flexing</b> resistance no <b>cracks</b> permitted; hardness (54, 17 - 72,g 6) shore A. The 10 pairs ofcanvas shoes were also visually inspected according to sII 1406 - 85 and they fulfilled the requirements. Besides testing some standards concepts from other countries such as JIS (Japanese Industrial Standard), IS (Indian standard), CNS (china National Standard), KS (Korean standard) were also studied and based on them, a conclusion can be drawn as follows according to JIS. S 5002 - g 6, it was necessary to inspect them visually, to test their bursting strength, tensile strength and hardness; according to IS 375 - 1966 itwas necessary to inspect them visually to test their thickness, specific gravity, hardness, abrasion resisiance and flexing resistance according to cNS UDC 6 g 5 - 31 it was necessary to inspect them visually, to test their thickness, tensile strength, and elongation at break, according to KS M 6522 - 74 it was necessary to inspect them visually, to test their bursting strength, elongation at break and tensile sEength...|$|R
