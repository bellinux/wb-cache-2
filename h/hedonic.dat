5|$|Evidence from {{microelectrode}} recordings {{from the}} brains of animals shows that dopamine neurons in the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and substantia nigra are strongly activated by {{a wide variety of}} rewarding events. These reward-responsive dopamine neurons in the VTA and substantia nigra are crucial for reward-related cognition and serve as the central component of the reward system.The brain reward circuitry that is targeted by addictive drugs normally mediates the pleasure and strengthening of behaviors associated with natural reinforcers, such as food, water, and sexual contact. Dopamine neurons in the VTA are activated by food and water, and dopamine release in the NAc is stimulated by the presence of natural reinforcers, such as food, water, or a sexual partner....The NAc and VTA are central components of the circuitry underlying reward and memory of reward. As previously mentioned, the activity of dopaminergic neurons in the VTA appears to be linked to reward prediction. The NAc is involved in learning associated with reinforcement and the modulation of motoric responses to stimuli that satisfy internal homeostatic needs. The shell of the NAc appears to be particularly important to initial drug actions within reward circuitry; addictive drugs appear to have a greater effect on dopamine release in the shell than in the core of the NAc.... If motivational drive is described in terms of wanting, and <b>hedonic</b> evaluation in terms of liking, it appears that wanting can be dissociated from liking and that dopamine may influence these phenomena differently. Differences between wanting and liking are confirmed in reports by human addicts, who state that their desire for drugs (wanting) increases with continued use even when pleasure (liking) decreases because of tolerance.}} The function of dopamine varies in each axonal projection from the VTA and substantia nigra; for example, the VTA–nucleus accumbens shell projection assigns incentive salience ("want") to rewarding stimuli and its associated cues, the VTA–orbitofrontal cortex projection updates the value of different goals in accordance with their incentive salience, the VTA–amygdala and VTA–hippocampus projections mediate the consolidation of reward-related memories, and both the VTA–nucleus accumbens core and substantia nigra–dorsal striatum pathways are involved in learning motor responses that facilitate the acquisition of rewarding stimuli. Some activity within the VTA dopaminergic projections appears to be associated with reward prediction as well.|$|E

In this paper, odors emitted from four building materials that is wood, wood flooring, Tatami (Japanese traditional rush mat) and concrete were adopted and the sensory evaluation tests by human subjects were conducted. Odor intensity, <b>hedonics,</b> preference and acceptability were voted by ten young subjects. The impressions of odor represented by familiarity, freshness, complexity and warmness were evaluated as well.

Additional refinements to this theory have shown that people do not adapt to all life events equally, as people tend to adapt rapidly to some events (e.g. imprisonment), slowly to others (e.g. the death of a loved one), and not at all to others (e.g. noise and sex).|$|E

40|$|When satiety {{develops}} {{specific to}} sensory properties of food, variety leads to increased eating. The relationship between meal variety and dietary restraint was explored here in lean young women (18 – 20 years), classified into unrestrainers versus restrainers using the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire Restrained Eating Scale. The expected variety effect obtained for unrestrainers (p <. 05) {{but not for}} restrainers, despite a typical sensitivity to sensory-specific satiety and the same rate of habituation to sensory-based food responses (i. e., <b>hedonics)</b> across them. Unrestrainers' eating appeared guided by <b>hedonics</b> (p <. 05), but not restrainers'. These results suggest the potential involvement of an internal or participant characteristic, instead of an external factor, in moderating unrestrainers' versus restrainers' food consumption when offered a highly desired food (the favorite in the plain condition) versus less desired (but accepted) foods (presented successively with the favorite in the variety condition).

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} reliable cross-modal associations between odours and various visual, auditory, taste, and somatosensory attributes. How these associations arise is not well understood. We examined whether cross-modal associations to odours themselves form distinct groups, and whether these groupings relate to semantic (nameability, familiarity) and perceptual (intensity, irritancy, and <b>hedonics)</b> olfactory attributes. Participants evaluated 20 odours, varying {{in all of the}} latter attributes, and reported their visual, auditory, gustatory, and somatosensory associations for each. Significant inter-rater agreement was observed for all modalities except audition, and responses in all modalities were consistent with those obtained on a repeat test session 2 weeks later. Two groups of cross-modal odour associates emerged: one of which was related to the semantic attributes of odours and another which related to their perceptual attributes. The exception was taste, which was significantly associated with both.

40|$|The widely {{accepted}} view nowadays is that experiencing odours as rather pleasant or unpleasant is, {{to a certain}} degree, shaped {{on a daily basis}} through individual experience within one's culture via evaluative conditioning or, rather marginally so, via mere exposure to that certain odour. In other words, humans are not born with any fixed set of olfactory likes or dislikes but rather, they acquire them throughout their lifetime. However, olfactory sensation is not a "pure" percept, as odorant stimuli generally elicit a qualitative percept of an odorant - generated mainly by the olfactory nerve - as well as some degree of chemesthesis - a tactile confound of the odour generated mainly by the trigeminal nerve. The olfactory and trigeminal system exhibit complex interactions at both the peripheral and central level of chemosensory processing, which is also reflected in perceptual characteristics of the final percept, including perceived pleasantness (<b>hedonics).</b> If the olfactory contribution alone does not easily predict neonatal odour <b>hedonics,</b> due to newborns' limited previous exposure to chemosensory inputs, one may hypothesize that together with the strength of the trigeminal contribution they may form a significant factor affecting neonatal appetitive/aversive responses to odours.

40|$|Previous {{research}} from our laboratory {{has determined that}} {{in the absence of}} a gustatory response or taste <b>hedonics,</b> intraperitoneal (i. p.) glucose administration enhanced morphine-mediated analgesia in rats and had antinociceptive actions on its own. Two experiments examined the potential of a central mechanism for glucose’s actions on morphine-mediated antinociception. Morphine (2. 5 µg) was infused into the periaqueductal gray (PAG) while glucose (300 mg/kg) was injected into the peritoneal cavity, or glucose (32 nmol) was infused into the PAG while morphine (3. 2 mg/kg) was injected i. p. Doses of morphine and glucose were selected based on our own prior research for being below the threshold for analgesic efficacy. Antinociception was assessed using the hot-water tail-withdrawal procedure. Tail-withdrawal latency was tested at baseline (before), and 12, 24 and 36 minutes after the i. p. injection. The results indicated that 300 mg/kg glucose, administered i. p. effectively increased the antinociceptive potency of a low dose of centrally administered morphine, while central infusion of glucose enhanced peripheral morphine-mediated antinociception. These outcomes support previous evidence of glucose’s influence on the antinociception actions of opioid drugs. Furthermore, they suggest that glucose produces its enhancing actions on morphine-mediated antinociception in the brain. These results support the hypothesis that glucose does not need to go through a gustatory mechanism or taste <b>hedonics</b> to alter morphine’s antinociceptive actions...|$|R

500|$|While {{dopamine}} has {{a central}} role in mediating [...] "wanting" [...] — associated with the appetitive or approach behavioral responses to rewarding stimuli, detailed studies have shown that dopamine cannot simply be equated with <b>hedonic</b> [...] "liking" [...] or pleasure, as reflected in the consummatory behavioral response. Dopamine neurotransmission is involved in some but not all aspects of pleasure-related cognition, since pleasure centers have been identified both within the dopamine system (i.e., nucleus accumbens shell) and outside the dopamine system (i.e., ventral pallidum and parabrachial nucleus). [...] For example, direct electrical stimulation of dopamine pathways, using electrodes implanted in the brain, is experienced as pleasurable, and many types of animals are willing to work to obtain it. Antipsychotic drugs used to treat psychosis reduce dopamine levels and tend to cause anhedonia, a diminished ability to experience pleasure. Many types of pleasurable experiences—such as sex, enjoying food, or playing video games—increase dopamine release. All addictive drugs directly or indirectly affect dopamine neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens; these drugs increase drug [...] "wanting", leading to compulsive drug use, when repeatedly taken in high doses, presumably through the sensitization of incentive-salience. Drugs that increase synaptic dopamine concentrations include psychostimulants such as methamphetamine and cocaine. These produce increases in [...] "wanting" [...] behaviors, but do not greatly alter expressions of pleasure or change levels of satiation. However, opiate drugs such as heroin or morphine produce increases in expressions of [...] "liking" [...] and [...] "wanting" [...] behaviors. Moreover, animals in which the ventral tegmental dopamine system has been rendered inactive do not seek food, and will starve to death if left to themselves, but if food is placed in their mouths they will consume it and show expressions indicative of pleasure.|$|E
