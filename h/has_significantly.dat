5|$|Between 2015 and 2017, {{upgrades}} from K185 to K200 {{were also}} completed in Kulm, Planica, and Oberstdorf. All are now equipped for jumps exceeding 240m (previous hill records were broken at each opening event), {{as well as}} having improved facilities for athletes and spectators; Harrachov remains the only hill (at K185) to have not been upgraded since the 1990s. Although the new hills are much larger than ever before, most of them feature longer and less steeply angled slopes, designed purely for the V-style and {{with the knowledge of}} 80 years' worth of world record progression. Inrun tables have also been placed further back from the knoll and flight curves made shallower in order to allow athletes to glide more efficiently along the contour of the slope. This <b>has</b> <b>significantly</b> reduced such precarious heights over the knoll {{as was the case in}} the early 1990s and prior: in that era, athletes using the parallel style would jump in a more upward trajectory off the table, reaching vast heights but at the expense of distance. Furthermore, rather than glide, they instead plummeted towards the slope. However, Planica remains extremely steep in the flight phase; Vikersund, by comparison, has a longer slope and does not enable as much height over the knoll.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{biosphere}} <b>has</b> <b>significantly</b> altered its atmosphere. Oxygenic photosynthesis evolved , {{forming the}} primarily nitrogen–oxygen atmosphere of today. This change enabled {{the proliferation of}} aerobic organisms and, indirectly, {{the formation of the}} ozone layer due to the subsequent conversion of atmospheric O2 into O3. The ozone layer blocks ultraviolet solar radiation, permitting life on land. Other atmospheric functions important to life include transporting water vapor, providing useful gases, causing small meteors to burn up before they strike the surface, and moderating temperature. This last phenomenon is known as the greenhouse effect: trace molecules within the atmosphere serve to capture thermal energy emitted from the ground, thereby raising the average temperature. Water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone are the primary greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Without this heat-retention effect, the average surface temperature would be −18°C, in contrast to the current +15°C, and life on Earth probably would not exist in its current form. In May 2017, glints of light, seen as twinkling from an orbiting satellite a million miles away, were found to be reflected light from ice crystals in the atmosphere.|$|E
