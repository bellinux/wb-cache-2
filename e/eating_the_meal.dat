25|$|Thirty {{minutes after}} <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> <b>meal</b> the {{children}} complained of stomach pain {{and soon after}} were taken ill with vomiting and diarrhoea. The number of sick children overwhelmed the school and local medical system. Some of the sick children were sent home, forcing their parents to seek help on their own. According to the official count, 23 children {{died as a result}} of the contaminated food. Parents and local villagers said at least 27 had died. Sixteen children died on site, and four others were declared dead upon arrival at the local hospital. Others died in hospital. Among the dead were two children of a female cook, Panna Devi; her third child survived. A total of 48 students fell ill from the contaminated food. Three remained in a critical condition as of 17 July. Thirty-one children were moved from the local hospital to Patna Medical College Hospital (PMCH) for further treatment.|$|E
2500|$|Based on the Mishnah in Pesahim 119b, the afikoman is a {{substitute}} for the Passover sacrifice, which was the last thing eaten at the Passover Seder during the eras of the First and Second Temples and during the period of the Tabernacle. The Talmud states that it is forbidden to have [...] "afikoman" [...] after <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> <b>meal,</b> so that the taste of the matzo that was eaten during the meal remains in our mouths. Since the destruction of the Temple and the discontinuation of the Korban Pesach, Jews eat a piece of matzo now known as afikomen to finish the Passover Seder meal.|$|E
60|$|An {{hour later}} the young hunters {{reached the end}} of the lake, where a small, rocky {{watercourse}} joined that body of water to Firefly Lake. Here they went into camp, pitching their tent in a convenient spot among the trees. Over a bright campfire they cooked some of the fish to a turn, and took their time <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> <b>meal.</b> Then they sat around and chatted, and Giant told his chums something which interested them not a little.|$|E

60|$|An hour or {{two after}} <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> <b>meal</b> Frau Plomaert felt so much {{stronger}} {{that she was able}} to obey the order to go up to the cathedral. Ned went with the able bodied men to the cloisters. The Spaniards soon came among them, and dragged off numbers of those whom they thought most likely to have taken a prominent part in the fighting, to execution. As they did not wish others from whom money could be wrung to escape from their hands, they presently issued some food to the remainder. The women, after remaining for some hours in the cathedral, were suffered to depart to their homes, for their starving condition excited the compassion even of the Spaniards; and the atrocities which had taken place at the sacks of Mechlin, Zutphen and Naarden, were not repeated in Haarlem.|$|E

5000|$|The episode {{ends with}} a group of people <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> <b>meal,</b> often very messily with their hands and {{sometimes}} incorporating unusual serving utensils like wooden paddles, a chainsaw, and hockey sticks.

50|$|The {{nature of}} the tish differs from group to group but during the tish, the Hasidim intently and silently watch the rebbe <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> <b>meal</b> and are {{extremely}} eager to receive shirayim ("leftovers"), cooked alongside the Rebbe's courses, believing {{it to be a}} great merit (zechus) to eat something from the leftovers of a tzadik's meal.

After arriving back at his flat, the rest of the episode is dedicated to his preparation of the meal, sometimes accompanied by the guests he is cooking for.

50|$|In the summer, the {{barbecue}} is common, generally {{as a social}} event. Guests will usually be invited to bring beer (or wine), and on occasion meat, which the host will cook. Sometimes guests contribute a salad to the gathering instead. It is traditional for the men to cook the meat, and for the women to do everything else, although these patterns are changing. Similar Māori gatherings will often feature a hangi (pronounced harng-ee), a pit in which meats or fish are cooked with vegetables. A deep hole is dug in the ground, lined with red-hot stones and covered with vegetation. The food is then placed on top. The whole oven is sprinkled with water and sealed with more vegetation. The hole is then filled with earth and left to steam for several hours. Traditionally, men dig and prepare the hole, and women prepare the food to go in it. All members of an extended family (whanau) help out for such a feast. The occasion is relaxed, friendly and fun, with people often <b>eating</b> <b>the</b> <b>meal</b> under a marquee.|$|E
