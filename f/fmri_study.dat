25|$|The {{most common}} risk to {{participants}} in an <b>fMRI</b> <b>study</b> is claustrophobia {{and there are}} reported risks for pregnant women {{to go through the}} scanning process. Scanning sessions also subject participants to loud high-pitched noises from Lorentz forces induced in the gradient coils by the rapidly switching current in the powerful static field. The gradient switching can also induce currents in the body causing nerve tingling. Implanted medical devices such as pacemakers could malfunction because of these currents. The radio-frequency field of the excitation coil may heat up the body, and this has to be monitored more carefully in those running a fever, the diabetic, and those with circulatory problems. Local burning from metal necklaces and other jewellery is also a risk.|$|E
25|$|Spatial {{resolution}} of an <b>fMRI</b> <b>study</b> refers {{to how well}} it discriminates between nearby locations. It {{is measured by the}} size of voxels, as in MRI. A voxel is a three-dimensional rectangular cuboid, whose dimensions are set by the slice thickness, the area of a slice, and the grid imposed on the slice by the scanning process. Full-brain studies use larger voxels, while those that focus on specific regions of interest typically use smaller sizes. Sizes range from 4 to 5mm to 1mm. Smaller voxels contain fewer neurons on average, incorporate less blood flow, and hence have less signal than larger voxels. Smaller voxels imply longer scanning times, since scanning time directly rises with the number of voxels per slice and the number of slices. This can lead both to discomfort for the subject inside the scanner and to loss of the magnetization signal. A voxel typically contains a few million neurons and tens of billions of synapses, with the actual number depending on voxel size and the area of the brain being imaged.|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} two decades there has been an {{increase}} on task and resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (<b>fMRI)</b> <b>studies</b> that explore the brain 2 ̆ 7 s functional changes in schizophrenia. However, it remains unclear as to whether the brain 2 ̆ 7 s functional changes during the resting state are sensitive to the same brain regions during task fMRI. Therefore, we conducted a systematic literature search of task and resting-state <b>fMRI</b> <b>studies</b> that investigated brain pathological changes in first-episode schizophrenia (Fleischhacker et al.). Nineteen studies met the inclusion criteria; seven were resting state <b>fMRI</b> <b>studies</b> with 371 FES patients and 363 healthy controls and twelve were task <b>fMRI</b> <b>studies</b> with 235 FES patients and 291 healthy controls. We found overlapping task and resting-state fMRI abnormalities in the prefrontal regions, including the dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex, the orbital frontal cortex and the temporal lobe, especially in the left superior temporal gyrus (STG). The findings of this systematic review support the frontotemporal hypothesis of schizophrenia, and the disruption in prefrontal and STG might represent the pathophysiology of schizophrenia disorder at a relatively early stage...|$|R

We found that learning to read is associated with two patterns of change in brain activity: increased activity in left-hemisphere middle temporal and Inferior frontal gyrus and decreased activity in right inferotemporal cortica areas. Activity in the left-posterior superior temporal sulcus of the youngest readers was associated with the maturation of their phonological processing abilities.

2500|$|In 2011, an <b>fMRI</b> <b>study</b> {{demonstrated}} that the right temporoparietal junction (rTPJ) of higher-functioning adults with autism was not more selectively activated for mentalizing judgments when compared to physical judgments about self and other. [...] rTPJ selectivity for mentalizing was also related to individual variation on clinical measures of social impairment: individuals whose rTPJ was increasingly more active for mentalizing compared to physical judgments were less socially impaired, while those who showed little to no difference in response to mentalizing or physical judgments were the most socially impaired. This evidence builds on work in typical development that suggests rTPJ is critical for representing mental state information, irrespective of whether it is about oneself or others. It also points to an explanation at the neural level for the pervasive mind-blindness difficulties in autism that are evident throughout the lifespan.|$|E

40|$|Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) is {{a popular}} noninvasive {{modality}} to investigate activation in the human brain. The end result of most fMRI experiments is an activation map corresponding to the given paradigm. These maps can vary greatly from one study to the next, so quantifying the reliability of identified activation over several <b>fMRI</b> <b>studies</b> is important. The percent overlap of activation (Rombouts et al., 1998 and Machielsen et al., 2000) is a global reliability measure between activation maps drawn from any two <b>fMRI</b> <b>studies.</b> A slightly modified but more intuitive measure {{is provided by the}} Jaccard (1901) coefficient of similarity, whose use we study in this paper. A generalization of these measures is also proposed to comprehensively summarize the reliability of multiple <b>fMRI</b> <b>studies.</b> Finally, a testing mechanism to flag potentially anomalous studies is developed. The methodology is illustrated on studies involving left- and right-hand motor task paradigms performed by a right-hand dominant male subject several times over a period of two months, with excellent results...|$|R
40|$|Isoflurane (ISO) {{can be a}} {{valuable}} alternative for alpha-chloralose (ACL) anesthesia in functional MRI (<b>fMRI)</b> <b>studies.</b> Therefore, we compared {{the efficacy of the}} blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) effect in <b>fMRI</b> <b>studies</b> during ISO and ACL anesthesia sequentially in the same animals. After non-invasive instrumentation for ventilation and monitoring, series of T 2 * weighted MR images were acquired during forepaw stimulation, first under ISO, then followed by ACL anesthesia. The results demonstrated that ISO and ACL were both suitable to perform this fMRI experiment. The center of activation was at the same stereotactic position for both anesthetics and matched the primary somatosensory cortex (S 1). Under the applied conditions, the BOLD response during ISO anesthesia declined in magnitude during the first stimulation period, as compared to ACL. From this study, we conclude that since ISO has several positive properties in comparison to ACL, including fast pharmacokinetics and suitability for repeated measurements, it is {{a valuable}} alternative for anesthesia in <b>fMRI</b> <b>studies</b> of rats...|$|R
2500|$|Pareidolia {{can cause}} people to {{interpret}} random images, or patterns of light and shadow, as faces. A 2009 magnetoencephalography study found that objects perceived as faces evoke an early (165 ms) activation of the fusiform face area {{at a time and}} location similar to that evoked by faces, whereas other common objects do not evoke such activation. This activation is similar to a slightly faster time (130 ms) that is seen for images of real faces. The authors suggest that face perception evoked by face-like objects is a relatively early process, and not a late cognitive reinterpretation phenomenon. [...] A functional magnetic resonance imaging (<b>fMRI)</b> <b>study</b> in 2011 similarly showed that repeated presentation of novel visual shapes that were interpreted as meaningful led to decreased fMRI responses for real objects. These results indicate that the interpretation of ambiguous stimuli depends upon processes similar to those elicited by known objects.|$|E
2500|$|Neuroimaging {{studies have}} {{observed}} decreased levels of NAA in the hippocampus {{of people with}} fibromyalgia, indicating decreased neuron functionality in this region. [...] Altered connectivity and decreased grey matter of the default mode network, the insula, and executive attention network {{have been found in}} fibromyalgia. [...] Increased levels of glutamate and glutamine have been observed in the amygdala, parts of the prefrontal cortex, the posterior cingulate cortex, and the insula, correlating with pain levels in FM. [...] Decreased GABA has been observed in the anterior insular in fibromyalgia. [...] However, neuroimaging studies, in particular neurochemical imaging studies, are limited by methodology and interpretation. [...] Increased cerebral blood flow in response to pain was found in one <b>fMRI</b> <b>study.</b> [...] Findings of decreased blood flow in the thalamus and other regions of the basal ganglia correlating with treatment have been relatively consistent over three studies. [...] Decreased binding of μ-opioid receptor have been observed; however, it is unknown if this is a result of increased endogenous binding in response to pain, or down regulation.|$|E
2500|$|Akinetopsia is an {{intriguing}} condition {{brought about by}} damage to the Extrastriate cortex MT+ that renders humans and monkeys unable to perceive motion, seeing {{the world in a}} series of static [...] "frames" [...] instead and indicates {{that there might be a}} [...] "motion centre" [...] in the brain. Of course, such data can only indicate that this area is at least necessary to motion perception, not that it is sufficient; however, other evidence has shown the importance of this area to primate motion perception. Specifically, physiological, neuroimaging, perceptual, electrical- and transcranial magnetic stimulation evidence (Table 1) all come together on the area V5/hMT+. Converging evidence of this type is supportive of a module for motion processing. However, this view is likely to be incomplete: other areas are involved with motion perception, including V1, V2 and V3a [...] and areas surrounding V5/hMT+ (Table 2). A recent <b>fMRI</b> <b>study</b> put the number of motion areas at twenty-one. [...] Clearly, this constitutes a stream of diverse anatomical areas. The extent to which this is ‘pure’ is in question: with Akinetopsia come severe difficulties in obtaining structure from motion. V5/hMT+ has since been implicated in this function as well as determining depth. Thus the current evidence suggests that motion processing occurs in a modular stream, although with a role in form and depth perception at higher levels.|$|E
