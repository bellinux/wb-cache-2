ATM, the gene responsible for this multi-system disorder, encodes a protein of the same name which coordinates the cellular response to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). Radiation therapy, chemotherapy that acts like radiation (radiomimetic drugs) and certain biochemical processes and metabolites can cause DSBs. When these breaks occur, ATM stops the cell from making new DNA (cell cycle arrest) and recruits and activates other proteins to repair the damage. Thus, ATM allows the cell to repair its DNA before the completion of cell division. If DNA damage is too severe, ATM will mediate the process of programmed cell death (apoptosis) to eliminate the cell and prevent genomic instability.|$|E

Cofilin- 1 (CFL- 1) is a primary non-muscle isoform of the ADF/cofilin protein family accelerating the actin filamental turnover in vitro and in vivo.

Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) proteins are known to subvert autophagic pathways, but the link to Kaposi's sarcoma pathogenesis is unclear. We find that oncogenic assault caused by latent KSHV infection elicits <b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> <b>responses</b> (<b>DDRs)</b> characteristic of OIS, yet infected cells display only modest levels of autophagy and fail to senesce. These aberrant responses result from the combined activities of tandemly expressed KSHV v-cyclin and v-FLIP proteins. v-Cyclin deregulates the cell cycle, triggers DDRs, and if left unchecked can promote autophagy and senescence. However, during latency v-FLIP blocks v-cyclin-induced autophagy and senescence {{in a manner that}} requires intact v-FLIP ATG 3 -binding domains.

Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) sustain life-long blood production, yet their <b>response</b> to <b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> remains largely unexplored.

Unfortunately, tracking <b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> <b>responses</b> (<b>DDRs),</b> histone deposition, and chromatin maturation at replication forks is difficult in mammalian cells. Here we describe a technology called iPOND (isolation of proteins on nascent DNA) to analyze proteins at active and damaged replication forks at high resolution.

Chromatin maturation continues even when decoupled from replisome movement. Furthermore, fork stalling causes changes in the recruitment and phosphorylation of proteins at the damaged fork. Checkpoint kinases catalyze H 2 AX phosphorylation, which spreads from the stalled fork to include a large chromatin domain even prior to fork collapse and double-strand break formation. Finally, we demonstrate a switch in the DDR at persistently stalled forks that includes MRE 11 -dependent RAD 51 assembly.

JADE1S negatively regulates cytokinesis of the epithelial cell cycle, a function specific to the small isoform. First report that suggested JADE1 function in G2/M/G1 transition showed that during the late G2 phase, JADE1S undergoes phosphorylation linked to its dissociation from chromatin into the cytoplasm. Mass Spectral analysis identified that total of six individual amino acid residues are phosphorylated by a mitotic kinase. Based on pharmacological analysis, JADE1 phosphorylation and compartmentalization is regulated by Aurora A and Aurora B pathways. Other kinases have been reported and may play a role. Upon completion of mitosis around telophase, the main pool of the JADE1S protein undergoes de-phosphorylation and re-associates with apparently condensing chromatin inside the reformed nuclei. A discrete pool of JADE1S associates with the cleavage furrow and subsequently appears in the midbody of the cytokinetic bridge. Interestingly, only JADE1S, but not JADE1L or HBO1 was found in the midbody of the cells undergoing cytokinesis. The spatial regulation of JADE1S during the cell division suggested role in G2/M to G1 transition, which includes cytokinesis and final abscission.Cytokinesis is the final step of cell cycle which controls fidelity of division of cellular content, including cytoplasm, membrane, and chromatin. Cytokinetic bridge is severed during the final abscission which occurs near the midbody and may take up to 2 hours. Cytokinesis and final abscission are tightly controlled by regulatory protein complexes and checkpoint proteins.

These findings reveal a novel functional link between mTOR and DDR pathways in the nucleus potentially operating as a survival mechanism against unfavorable growth conditions...|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{senescence}} {{is accompanied}} by dramatic changes in chromatin structure and gene expression. Using S. cerevisiae mutants lacking telomerase (tlc 1 Δ) to model senescence, we find that with critical telomere shortening the telomere binding protein Rap 1 relocalizes to the upstream promoter regions of hundreds of new target genes. The set of new Rap 1 targets at senescence (NRTS) are preferentially activated at senescence, and experimental manipulations of Rap 1 levels indicate that it contributes directly to NRTS activation, potentially in conjunction with enzymes involved in H 2 B ubiquitylation (Bre 1 /Lge 1). A notable subset of NRTS includes the core histone-encoding genes; we find that Rap 1 contributes to their repression and that histone protein levels decline at senescence. Rap 1 and histones also display a target site-specific antagonism that leads to diminished nucleosome occupancy at the promoters of upregulated NRTS. This antagonism apparently impacts the rate of senescence because under-expression of Rap 1 or over-expression of the core histones delays senescence. Rap 1 relocalization {{is not a simple}} consequence of lost telomere binding sites, but rather depends on the Mec 1 checkpoint kinase. Rap 1 relocalization is thus a novel mechanism connecting <b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> <b>responses</b> (<b>DDRs)</b> at telomeres to global changes in chromatin and gene expression while driving the pace of senescence. ...|$|R

Thus, a real-time method to image <b>DNA</b> <b>damage</b> in vivo {{would be useful}} to diagnose cancer and monitor its treatment. Toward this end, we have developed fluorophore- and radioisotope-labeled immunoconjugates to target a DDR signaling protein, phosphorylated histone H 2 A variant H 2 AX (γH 2 AX), which forms foci at sites of DNA double-strand breaks. Anti-γH 2 AX antibodies were modified by the addition of diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) to allow (111) In labeling or the fluorophore Cy 3. The cell-penetrating peptide Tat (GRKKRRQRRRPPQGYG) was also added to the immunoconjugate to aid nuclear translocation. In irradiated breast cancer cells, confocal microscopy confirmed the expected colocalization of anti-γH 2 AX-Tat with γH 2 AX foci. In comparison with nonspecific antibody conjugates, (111) In-anti-γH 2 AX-Tat was retained longer in cells. Anti-γH 2 AX-Tat probes were also used to track in vivo <b>DNA</b> <b>damage,</b> using a mouse xenograft model of human breast cancer. After local X-ray irradiation or bleomycin treatment, the anti-γH 2 AX-Tat probes produced fluorescent and single photon emission computed tomography signals in the tumors that were proportionate to the delivered radiation dose and the amount of γH 2 AX present. Taken together, our findings establish the use of radioimmunoconjugates that target γH 2 AX as a noninvasive imaging method to monitor <b>DNA</b> <b>damage,</b> with many potential applications in preclinical and clinical settings...|$|R
