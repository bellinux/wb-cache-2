25|$|In the 1620s, {{encouraged}} by Pope Urban VIII who {{wanted him to}} fresco the Benediction Loggia of St. Peter's (never executed), Bernini began in earnest to develop and perfect his technique as a painter. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> learned the basics from his father who was a painter as well, in addition to some training in the studio of the Florentine painter, Cigoli. According to early biographers, Baldinucci and Domenico Bernini, Bernini completed at least 150 canvases, mostly in the decades of the 1620s and 30s, but currently {{there are no more}} than 35-40 surviving paintings that can be confidently attributed to his hand (they are mostly close-up faces—including several wonderfully wrought self-portraits—set against a blank background, employing a loose, painterly brushstroke (similar to that of his Spanish contemporary Velasquez) and a very limited palette of mostly somber colors with deep chiaroscuro. The only one that is securely dated is that of the Apostles Andrew and Thomas in London's National Gallery. As for his drawings, about 300 still exist; but this is a minuscule percentage of the drawings he would have created in his lifetime; these include rapid sketches relating to major sculptural or architectural commissions, presentation drawings given as gifts to his patrons and aristocratic friends, and exquisite, fully finished portraits, such as those of Agostino Mascardi (Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Paris) and Scipione Borghese and Sisinio Poli (both in New York's Morgan Library).|$|E
500|$|Wulfstan's {{early life}} is obscure, {{but he was}} {{certainly}} the uncle of one Beorhtheah, his successor at Worcester but one, and the uncle of Wulfstan of Worcester. About Wulfstan's youth we know nothing. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> familial ties to the Fenlands in East Anglia, and to Peterborough specifically. Although {{there is no direct}} evidence of his ever being monastic, the nature of Wulfstan's later episcopal career and his affinity with the Benedictine Reform argue that he had once studied and professed as a Benedictine monk, perhaps at Winchester. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Wulfstan was consecrated bishop of London in 996, succeeding Aelfstan. Besides the notice in the Chronicle, the first record of his name is in a collection of nine Latin penitential letters collected by him, three of which were issued by him as bishop of London, and one by him as [...] "Archbishop of the English". The other five letters in the collection (only one of which is addressed to Wulfstan, as archbishop) were issued by Pope Gregory V and by a Pope John (either Pope John XVII or Pope John XVIII). In the letters issued by Wulfstan as bishop of London he styles himself [...] "Lupus episcopus", meaning [...] "the bishop Wolf". [...] "Lupus" [...] is the Latin form of the first element of his Old English name, which means [...] "wolf-stone".|$|E
500|$|Until mid-1888, Foraker had the {{enthusiastic}} support of Hanna, who, while still boosting John Sherman for president, was a generous {{contributor to the}} governor's 1885 and 1887 campaigns. [...] Hanna hoped {{to be able to}} dispense patronage in northern Ohio. [...] According to Hanna biographer William T. Horner, however, [...] "unfortunately for Hanna, Foraker largely refused to grant Hanna the authority that by tradition <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> earned." [...] One example, later cited by Foraker as a reason his close relationship with Hanna ended, was the question of the position of state oil inspector, whose substantial fees were paid, not by the taxpayer, but by the oil companies, and who was permitted to appoint large numbers of deputies. [...] In 1885, soon after Foraker's inauguration, Hanna advocated the appointment of William M. Bayne, while Congressman McKinley pressed the name of Edwin Hartshorn. [...] Hanna agreed to withdraw Bayne, not to accommodate McKinley, but to save Foraker from a difficulty. [...] Hanna wrote to Foraker, [...] "I had a call from Major McKinley and his oil inspector candidate. ... I tell him he 'wants the earth'..." [...] However, Foraker instead reappointed the incumbent, Louis Smithnight. [...] One of the men appointed deputy oil inspector was Harry Smith, the black editor who had supported Foraker in the 1885 election. [...] McKinley again approached Foraker after his re-election in 1887 seeking Hartshorn's appointment; however, Foraker appointed George B. Cox, Republican boss of Cincinnati, as chief though Smithnight was retained as a deputy. [...] In later years, Foraker suggested the dispute over the oil inspectorship was a reason for Hanna breaking from him and allying with McKinley, stating after Hanna's death in 1904, [...] "I have often thought since that my appointment of Cox made McKinley president." ...|$|E

Altogether, some 79 plays were performed during Tynan’s period at the National Theatre; 32 were his idea, and another 20 chosen with his collaboration. Tynan also persuaded Olivier to play the title role in Shakespeare's Othello, something the actor had always been reluctant to do: Olivier's Othello opened at the National Theatre in 1964 to glowing reviews, and was filmed in 1965.|$|E

2500|$|Various {{interpretations of}} the meaning of the picture have been offered: the {{conflict}} between youth and old age, time as the devourer of all things, the wrath of God and an allegory of the situation in Spain, where the fatherland consumed its own children in wars and revolution. There have been explanations rooted in Goya's relationships with his own son, Xavier, the only of his six children to survive to adulthood, or with his live-in housekeeper and possible mistress, Leocadia Weiss; the sex of the body being consumed can not be determined with certainty. If Goya made any notes on the picture, they have not survived; as he never intended the picture for public exhibition, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> little interest in explaining its significance. It has been said that the painting is [...] "essential {{to our understanding of the}} human condition in modern times, just as Michelangelo's Sistine Chapel ceiling is essential to understanding the tenor of the 16th century".|$|E
2500|$|Juan Ponce de León, {{a famous}} Spanish conqueror and explorer, is usually {{given credit for}} being the first European to sight Florida, but <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> predecessors. Florida {{and much of the}} nearby coast is {{depicted}} in the Cantino planisphere, an early world map which was surreptitiously copied in 1502 from the most current Portuguese sailing charts and smuggled into Italy a full decade before Ponce sailed north from Puerto Rico on his voyage of exploration. Ponce de León may not have even been the first Spaniard to go ashore in Florida; slave traders may have secretly raided native villages before Ponce arrived, as he encountered at least one indigenous tribesman who spoke Spanish. However, Ponce's 1513 expedition to Florida was the first open and official one. He also gave Florida its name, which means [...] "full of flowers." [...] Another dubious legend states that Ponce de León was searching for the Fountain of Youth on the island of Bimini, based on information from natives.|$|E
2500|$|The {{account of}} Josephus in The Jewish War, {{refers to the}} Onias who built the Temple at Leontopolis as [...] "the son of Simon", {{implying}} that it was Onias III, and not his son, who fled to Egypt and built the Temple. This account, however, is contradicted by the story that Onias III was murdered at Antioch in 171 BCE. Josephus' account in the Antiquities is therefore more probable, namely, that the builder of the temple was a son of the murdered Onias III, and that, a mere youth {{at the time of}} his father's death, he had fled to the court of Alexandria in consequence of the Syrian persecutions, perhaps because he thought that salvation would come to his people from Egypt. Ptolemy VI was King of Egypt at that time. <b>He</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> not yet given up his claims to Coele-Syria and Judea, and gladly gave refuge to such a prominent personage of the neighboring country. Onias now requested the king and his sister-wife, Cleopatra, to allow him to build a sanctuary in Egypt similar to the one at Jerusalem, where he would employ Levites and priests of his own clan; and he referred to the prediction of the prophet Isaiah that a Jewish temple would be erected in Egypt.|$|E

2500|$|The {{dispute with}} MacDonnell was carried {{on in the}} pages of The Times - Long trying to galvanise Unionist opinion in both England and Ireland. [...] Balfour, Jack Sandars (Balfour's private secretary), and Wyndham all thought he had been duped by Unionism [...] "where his vanity and hopes are concerned", characterising the Chief Secretary as easily manipulated. [...] In October 1906, Saunderson died, and Long was chosen as the new Chairman of Irish Unionist Alliance (IUA) - aimed at closer {{co-operation}} between northern and southern parties. [...] Three months later, he was also elected as Chairman of the Ulster Unionist Council (UUC). In 1907, he formed the Union Defence League (UDL) [...] as a support in Great Britain for Irish unionism. The UDL in London linked with the UUC in Belfast and the IUA in Dublin. It had support from Conservative backbenchers but not the leadership. It was active in 1907–08 and again after 1911 when the Third Home Rule Bill was imminent; with the Primrose League it created the 1914 British Covenant mirroring the 1912 Ulster Covenant.

2500|$|In 1847 Tyndall {{opted to}} become a {{mathematics}} and surveying teacher at (Queenwood College), a boarding school in Hampshire. Recalling this decision later, he wrote: [...] "the desire to grow intellectually did not forsake me; and, when railway work slackened, I accepted in 1847 a post as master in Queenwood College." [...] Another recently arrived young teacher at Queenwood was Edward Frankland, who had previously worked as a chemical laboratory assistant for the British Geological Survey. Frankland and Tyndall became good friends. On the strength of Frankland's prior knowledge, they {{decided to go to}} Germany to further their education in science. Among other things, Frankland knew that certain German universities were ahead of any in Britain in experimental chemistry and physics. (British universities were still focused on classics and mathematics and not laboratory science.) The pair moved to Germany in summer 1848 and enrolled at the University of Marburg, attracted by the reputation of Robert Bunsen as a teacher. Tyndall studied under Bunsen for two years. Perhaps more influential for Tyndall at Marburg was Professor Hermann Knoblauch, with whom Tyndall maintained communications by letter for many years afterwards. Tyndall's Marburg dissertation was a mathematical analysis of screw surfaces in 1850 (under Friedrich Ludwig Stegmann). Tyndall stayed in Germany for a further year doing research on magnetism with Knoblauch, including some months' visit at the Berlin laboratory of Knoblauch's main teacher, Heinrich Gustav Magnus. It is clear today that Bunsen and Magnus were among the very best experimental science instructors of the era. Thus, when Tyndall returned to live in England in summer 1851, <b>he</b> <b>probably</b> <b>had</b> as good an education in experimental science as anyone in England.|$|E
