50|$|Arthur C. Townley, {{a failed}} <b>flax</b> <b>farmer</b> from Beach, North Dakota, and former {{organizer}} for the Socialist Party of America, had attended the Society of Equity meeting. Afterward Townley and a friend, Frank B. Wood, {{drew up a}} radical political platform at Wood's kitchen table that addressed many of the farmers' concerns. Soon, Townley was traveling the state in a borrowed Model T Ford signing up NPL members for a payment of $6 in dues. Farmers were receptive to Townley's ideas and joined in droves.|$|E
50|$|Lawson {{was born}} near Muthill, Scotland {{and became a}} <b>flax</b> <b>farmer</b> in Perthshire. He was {{recommended}} in 1769 to James William Montgomery, Scotland’s lord advocate, who {{was the owner of}} the township of Lot 34 in the new British colony of St. John's Island (renamed Prince Edward Island in 1799). Lawson recruited about 50 indentured servants in Perthshire and embarked with his family on the Falmouth from Greenock on 8 April 1770. The Falmouth arrived on 8 June 1770 in Stanhope (named after Montgomery's Scottish estate) after a difficult voyage.|$|E
50|$|Many poor German {{immigrants}} and Scots-Irish settlers began their careers as agricultural wage laborers. Merchants and artisans hired teen-aged indentured servants, paying the transportation over from Europe, as workers for a domestic {{system for the}} manufacture of cloth and other goods. Merchants often bought wool and <b>flax</b> from <b>farmers</b> and employed newly arrived immigrants who had been textile workers in Ireland and Germany to work in their homes spinning the materials into yarn and cloth. Large farmers and merchants became wealthy, while farmers with smaller farms and artisans only made enough for subsistence.|$|R
50|$|Some {{immigrants}} who just arrived purchased farms and shared in this export wealth, but many poor German and Irish immigrants {{were forced to}} work as agricultural wage laborers.

The Mid-Atlantic region, by 1750, was divided by both ethnic background and wealth.|$|R
40|$|Triffid is {{the name}} given to a genetically {{modified}} (GM) variety of flaxseed that {{was developed in the}} late 1980 s at the University of Saskatchewan's Crop Development Centre. The variety was designed to thrive in soil containing residues from sulfonylurea-type herbicides and offered greater weed control options to flax growers. In 1998, Triffid received Canadian and American feed and food regulatory approvals and entered a seed multiplication program. The following year, Europe threatened to stop importing Canadian flax should GM flax enter into commercial production. By April 2001, Triffid was deregistered and all remaining seed was supposedly destroyed. However, in late 2009, Triffid flax was unexpectedly detected in EU food products and in subsequent flax imports into Europe from Canada. In response to this, the EU immediately halted Canadian flax imports. This article documents Canadian costs of the Triffid flax issue as an example of low level presence (LLP) of an unapproved transformation event in a zero-tolerance European market. It explores/evaluates the impacts (economic and social costs) on the Canadian industry—including the development of a stewardship program and testing protocols, the engagement and relationship strategies utilized in negotiations with the EU to resolve market access, and the overall industry response to the issue (from producers to exporters). The article presents survey responses from more than 270 Western Canadian <b>flax</b> <b>farmers.</b> This survey data provides new insights as to how farmers manage LLP on-farm. The production attributes that are examined range from field agronomics to ability to export. Specifically, it examines how farmers have dealt with flax, in terms of production and sale, since the Fall of 2009. Detailed analysis is provided for the following supply chain components: on-farm testing, carryover costs, and opportunity costs. Finally, the article provides some insights as to who farmers trust in terms of communicating information to them on how to best manage this situation...|$|R
50|$|In 1913 Henry G. Teigan {{was elected}} State Secretary of the Socialist Party of North Dakota. Teigan sought to greatly expand the party's size and {{influence}} through a concentrated grassroots recruiting effort targeted {{in the rural}} {{western part of the}} state. Teigan hired a paid organizer for this task, Arthur C. Townley, a formerly prosperous <b>flax</b> <b>farmer</b> who had seen his substantial operation located on the Western border of the state near the town of Beach wiped out in 1912 by early winter weather and falling commodity prices. Townley set out on his organizing efforts late in 1913 but met with resistance among the farmers he approached, who supported the various economic ideas put forward by the Socialist Party but who refused to support that organization itself.|$|E
40|$|Flax (Linum usitatissimum) fibers {{have the}} {{advantages}} of low density, low cost, and recyclability and are considered as a potential material to reinforce plastic materials. Though Canada {{is one of the}} largest seed flax growing countries in the world, the utilization of flax fibers as reinforcement in composites is not as developed as in Europe. Indeed, in Canada, a large amount of flax straws are left in the fields and burned by farmers each year. Therefore, development of technologies to make use of flax straws for reinforcement in composites and for other purposes has huge benefits to both the material industries and <b>flax</b> <b>farmers</b> in Canada. This thesis presented a study of flax fibers reinforced biocomposites by injection molding through modeling and optimization. The focus of the study was to understand the relationships between the properties of biocomposites and the processing conditions through the experiment and improve the qualities of biocomposites by optimizing the processing conditions. In this thesis, biocomposites were successfully produced by injection molding with a proposed processing scheme. The influence of flax fiber loading and processing conditions, including injection temperature and pressure on the mechanical properties (tensile properties and flexural properties), and water absorption of biocomposites was investigated. The study also experimentally investigated the effect of the processing conditions (fiber content and temperature) on the rheological properties of biocomposites. In order to implement the simulation analysis of injection molding for biocomposites, the Cross-WLF model was employed to obtain the rheological information of biocomposites. Further, a systematic approach on simulation analysis and optimization of injection molding was proposed to minimize the shrinkage and warpage of biocomposites. Several conclusions are drawn from this study: 1) With respect of the influence of the processing conditions on the properties of biocomposites, (a) Fiber content is the most significant impact factor influencing the mechanical properties of biocomposites compared with the other two processing conditions and the tensile properties and flexural properties of biocomposites dreamingly increased with flax fiber content; (b) lower injection temperature led to higher tensile properties and flexural properties; (c) Water absorption of biocomposites was significantly dependent on fiber content and injection temperature; (d) Injection pressure had no significant effect on either mechanical properties or water absorption. 2) In the study on the rheological characteristics, (a) The shear viscosity of biocomposites increased with fiber content, but at very high shear rates (from 5, 000 to 10, 000 S− 1), the shear viscosities of biocomposites with various fiber content (from 0 to 30 %) tended to be the same; (b) The shear viscosity of biocomposites decreased with temperature, and at higher shear rate, all the shear viscosity variations as function of shear rates followed the same rate for different temperatures; (c) At high shear rate, the shear viscosity mostly depended on the shear rate rather than fiber content and temperature; (d) A method was presented to determine the seven parameters of the Cross-WLF model for biocomposites. 3) For minimizing the shrinkage and warpage of injection molded biocomposites, (a) The significant factors on the shrinkage and warpage of biocomposites by injection molding were injection temperature, packing time, and packing pressure; (b) The optimization of the injection molding of biocomposites for reducing the shrinkage and warpage of biocomposites was successful by integrating design of experiment (DOE) and simulation technique. The contribution of this thesis includes: 1) In the field of biocomposites reinforcement, the study has shown a great promise to use flax fibers to enhance the mechanical properties of thermoplastics, in particular an increase of 41. 83 % in tensile strength and an increase of 47. 13 % in flexural strength. In addition, this work has provided a mathematical relationship between the processing condition of injection molding and the mechanical properties of biocomposites, which would be important to control the manufacturing process to reach desired mechanical properties. 2) In the field of optimal design and manufacturing of flax fiber biocomposites, this work has provided: (a) an effective method to determine the parameters in the rheology model of the biocomposites melt, which has been an important step in simulating the process, and this method has a generalized implication to other types of biocomposites; and (b) a systematic approach to optimize the injection molding process for minimizing the shrinkage and warpage of biocomposites, which are the two most important quality issues in biocomposites...|$|R
