40|$|Adopting an {{intergroup}} perspective, {{the research}} was designed to examine predictors <b>of</b> <b>employee</b> responses to an organizational merger. Data were collected from 120 <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> a newly merged scientific organization. As predicted from social identity theory, the most negative responses to the merger were apparent among the <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> the low status premerger organization. There was also evidence of ingroup bias among both groups <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> involved in the merger—as expected, the bias was most marked on the status-irrelevant dimensions for the <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> the lower status organization, but most marked on the status-relevant dimensions for the <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> the high status organization. Also, in support of social identity theory, the perceived legitimacy of {{the basis for the}} status differentiation between the groups was associated with more positive responses to the merger among <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> the low status premerger organization, but with poorer responses among <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> the high status premerger organization. There was consistent evidence that the status by legitimacy interaction was mediated through the extent to which <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> the newly merged organization perceived a common ingroup identit...|$|R

50|$|Part-time and {{temporary}} employees are counted {{the same as}} full-time employees. § 121.106(b)(2). Where the number <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> fluctuates {{over the course of}} a year, the number <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> may be taken to be the average number <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> over the preceding 12 calendar months. § 121.106(b)(1). The average number <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> a business concern with affiliates is calculated by adding the average number <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> the business concern with the average number <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> each affiliate. § 121.106(b)(4)(i). If a concern has acquired an affiliate or been acquired as an affiliate during the applicable period of measurement or before the date on which it self-certified as small, the employees counted in determining size status include the <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> the acquired or acquiring concern. Furthermore, this aggregation applies for the entire period of measurement, not just the period after the affiliation arose. The <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> a former affiliate are not counted if affiliation ceased before the date used for determining size. § 121.106(b)(4)(ii). This exclusion <b>of</b> <b>employees</b> <b>of</b> a former affiliate applies during the entire period of measurement, rather than only for the period after which affiliation ceased.|$|R
