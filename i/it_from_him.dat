He took advantage {{of his relationship with}} important people in the kingdom {{in order to get the}} recognition of the seaport, located in Lower Varzim, as his honour. He tried to convince King Denis, that the king's father, Afonso, took <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> unfairly. Justifying the attitude with the Honour of Varzim, Gomes and his descendants went to the port to get the tribute from the fishermen.|$|E

5|$|In 1937 he did {{not succeed}} in {{defending}} his French Pro title as Hans Nüsslein took <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> in three sets. The doubles final was played betweenStoefen–Tilden and Cochet-Ramillon with the former team crowned champions in the end. Cochet then repeated the Soviet tour and missed the German Pro and the Bonnardel Cup. He returned to the tour at the Wembley Pro where he only won one match before having been knocked out in the semifinal stage. Cochet then was a part of a rather fruitless Italian tour, his only notably victory came in the Foro Italico against Tilden. The next year was spent mostly with Cochet-Tilden headlined trips to India and Ireland. He also returned to the Soviet Union for the third straight time to accept a coaching venture, {{which turned out to be}} a short-term assignment as the Soviet government accused him of espionage and expelled him.|$|E
5|$|McMurray and Montoya {{continued}} to lead {{for the next}} three laps, as 14 teams were repairing their cars in the garage after the lap 29 crash. On lap39, Keselowski retook the lead, after having assistance from Regan Smith. Three laps later, Johnson was preparing to return to the race. On lap43, Stewart took the lead one lap before Keselowski retook <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> On lap 45th, Bowyer became the quickest in the race with a speed of over 200mph. Two laps later, Robert Richardson, Jr. spun off the bumper of Travis Kvapil, bringing out yet the fifth caution. He sustained major damage to his car in the accident. Under caution, the leaders made pit stops, giving the first and second positions to Terry Labonte and Dave Blaney at the restart. On lap51, Kurt Busch led before Menard overtook him.|$|E

5|$|While {{keeping his}} {{involvement}} with Waters's underground filmmaking a secret from his parents, Divine continued relying on them financially, charging them for expensive parties that he held and writing bad checks. After charging them for a major repair to his car in 1972, his parents confiscated <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> {{and told him that}} they would not continue to financially support him in such a manner. In retaliation, he came by their house the following day, collected his two pet dogs and then disappeared, not seeing or speaking with them for the next nine years. Instead, he sent them over fifty postcards from across the world, informing them that he was fine, but on none did he leave a return address. Frances and Harris Milstead retired soon after and moved to Florida at the advice of Harris's doctor, who prescribed the southern state's warmer weather as being beneficial for Harris's muscular dystrophy.|$|E
5|$|The Commandoes Mob {{was formed}} in 2004 {{when a group of}} Gattaca females teamed up with a Young Ones roving coalition. Aragorn and Zorilla {{established}} dominance after several disputes. They remained the dominant pair till 2007 when Aragorn died. After the death of Aragorn, his son Ketamine established natal dominance beside his mother. Then five Whiskers males emigrated and all natal adult males had left, Zarathustra became dominant male till he was predated. Then Baker took his position but Miles stole <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> Throuought their history, the Commandos had been a fast-growing group, unlike their founding group the Gattaca. In January 2009, Zorilla, Miles, Baker Karim and Cody were killed by TB, the group is led by Whiskers male Panthro and Commandos female Celidh. Disease hit the group killing a few members. The Commandos left the monitored area and could no longer be tracked. A few new groups were formed from Commandos members. The Kung Fu was formed by Zorilla's sister. The Geckos and Sequioa were formed by Zorilla and Aragorn's daughters. Benzedrine is the last known surviving Commandos meerkat today.|$|E
5|$|At {{first the}} {{incursion}} was countered by the RAR, {{but after a}} tactical error in its third engagement with the guerrillas led to casualties, the African Rifles were joined by 2 Commando, RLI on 25 August 1967. The insurgents were consistently undone in their incursions by the suspicion of Rhodesia's rural blacks, whose tribal chiefs and headmen would often work together to inform the police and security forces of the infiltrators' presence. This proved to be no exception: when a cadre visited a local kraal early on 31 August to obtain food, an old woman invited him to stay and kept him there while she sent a young girl to alert the security forces. 7 Troop, 2 Commando arrived at 07:20 and captured the insurgent, who then guided 7 Troop, led by Lieutenant Charl Viljoen, and a platoon of RAR men to where his five comrades were encamped. The combined force surrounded the guerrillas and opened fire, killing four; the fifth escaped and returned to Zambia. The next day, on 1 September, some 2 Commando troops in ambush were informed by a tractor driver {{that he had been}} given money by 14 guerrillas the previous night to buy mielie-meal for them, and that they would be collecting <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> at his kraal that evening. A sweep was planned; the tractor driver was briefed and returned to the kraal with the mielie-meal while 2 Commando and the RAR formed a cordon around it. The following morning the soldiers performed their sweep but failed to find the enemy, who were already gone. The insurgents, who were actually 17 in number and all South African Umkhonto fighters, crossed the border into Botswana and were arrested there on 3 September. Of the 79 cadres who had crossed the border on 1 August, 29 were killed and 17 captured within Rhodesia, 29 were arrested in Botswana, where one also died, one was arrested in Durban and one escaped back to Zambia. One remained unaccounted for. Nickel was officially closed at 06:00 on 8 September 1967.|$|E

In 1078, Philaretos Brachamios, an Armenian rebel seized power. He held the city until the Seljuk Turks captured <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> in 1084.

In the meantime, son Adolph Bernard Jr. was born in 1911, followed by another daughter, Dorothy Constance, in 1913. It was after Dorothy's birth that Spreckels learned her husband had contracted syphilis before their marriage, as he began showing symptoms of the disease.

25|$|During that January though, {{the food}} {{ran out and}} none {{was left in the}} {{district}} — already affected by famine, the population took what little there was with them when they fled. The rainy season brought malaria and dysentery, all four surviving officers fell sick, and floods cut Bunkeya off from the game-rich plains to the north where they might have hunted. Moloney recovered first and took charge of the expedition's task of building a more permanent fort and trying to find food. 76 of the expedition's askaris and porters died that month of dysentery and starvation. Stairs had severe fevers, and in his delirium he imagined Thomson had arrived, and yelled for his revolver with which to repel the BSAC man; Moloney had wisely taken <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|Although the art {{is popular}} amongst {{different}} kinds of entertainers it seems prominent amongst magicians, because it was popularized by a magician who inspired many other magicians.

In 1889, Trewey joined with Alexander Herrmann who most likely learned <b>it</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> David Tobias Bamberg most likely learned it from Alexander who then passed it down to his son Okito (Tobias Leendert Bamberg) who then passed it down to his son Fu Manchu (David Theodore Bamberg).
