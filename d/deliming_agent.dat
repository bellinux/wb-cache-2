40|$|Abstract. The {{deliming}} experiment of limed pelt for leather-making {{was carried}} out by means of formic acid, sulfosalicylic acid, citrate acid, Nylon acid, gluconic acid and other nitrogen-free materials. The impacts of the pH of deliming liquid and the content of calcium ion in the deliming liquid on the deliming effect were investigated. In order to further improve the deliming effect of the material, the nitrogen-free organic acids above were subjected to composite research, wherein the results thereof showed that the deliming values of sulfosalicylic acid, formic acid and citrate acid were relatively high, the deliming abilities were relatively strong, but the buffer during the deliming process was not obvious; the deliming values of Nylon acid and gluconic acid were not relatively high, but the deliming process had a certain buffer; and the deliming effect of composite formic acid and gluconic acid was very good. Compared with the conventional <b>deliming</b> <b>agent</b> (NH 4) 2 SO 4, the composite <b>deliming</b> <b>agent</b> not only could remove the pollution caused by ammonia nitrogen in the deliming wastewater and greatly reduce the S 2 -in the wastewater, but also could effectively reduce CODCr and BOD 5 of the deliming effluent...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Sulfonated phthalic {{magnesium}} salt (SPMS) {{was used}} in the leather deliming process. The deliming properties of SPMS was determined with the indicators such as the change of pH, content of NH 4 -N, COD of deliming float, deliming speed, etc. The results show that SPMS has a mild deliming ability, excellent buffering and calcium removal performance; the total nitrogen content of deliming float is 3. 4 % of the conventional deliming process. Comprehensive performance of deliming is well and the delimed crust has a fine, smooth grain. It can be used as non-ammonium <b>deliming</b> <b>agent</b> in the clean leather manufacture, and it will benefits for the energy saving and emission reduction of leather industry...|$|E

This paper {{deals with}} {{decantation}} washing of calcimine (limed collagen splits), {{one of the}} valuable byproducts of leather manufacturing industry, in order to remove calcium hydroxide from the calcimine inner volume. This process can be mathematically described as diffusion accompanied by desorption. The process of desorption makes the governing equations non-linear. There are two steps to perform the deliming process {{the first one is}} a simple washing of the calcimine in plain water, the second one requires adding a <b>deliming</b> <b>agent.</b> We have worked out a mathematical model that enables us to determine if it is economically and technologically efficient to perform plain water washing or chemical deliming...|$|E
40|$|The {{optimization}} of {{the white}} hide deliming operation was studied. Generally, white hide contains both non-bonded and various amounts of strongly bonded lime. Initially, the processing costs of the deliming of non-bonded lime are relatively low. However, at a certain stage of the deliming process the processing costs begin to increase rapidly because {{of the strength of}} the lime bound to collagen, and at this point it is suitable to interrupt the washing with pure water {{and replace it with a}} <b>deliming</b> <b>agent.</b> Our paper, with the use of a mathematical-physical process model, offers a solution as to when the interruption should be done. Experimental determinations of sorption isotherm, as well as the effective diffusion coefficients are presented. The above mentioned parameters, economical and technological, serve as input data for a computer program...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to get deliming agents having function s bleaching agent in pickle process, but it also keeps {{the quality of the}} pickles and waste water remaining good. Deliming process is conducted on the preparation of pickles. Five deliming agents were used on the experiment, they were ZA 2 % (I), NH 4 Cl 2 % (II), NaHSO 32 % (III), a combination of ZA 1 % and NH 4 Cl 0, 5 % (IV), and a combination of ZA 1 % and NH 4 Cl 1 % (V). The quality of the pickles were then evaluated on the shade and the acceptance of panelists. In order to ascertain wheter or not the process be related as environmentally friendly one, the waste water quality were also evaluated. The results showed that NH 4 Cl 2 % was the best <b>deliming</b> <b>agent</b> as well as a bleaching agent...|$|E

Calcimine is a {{valuable}} by-product originating during the processing of cured hide into leather. It is used as raw material {{in the production of}} gelatin and biodegradable sheets. For further usage, it is necessary to remove calcium hydroxide from calcimine by chemical deliming, which is, from the environmental protection point of view, the most important stage of the entire deliming process. In this article, a mathematical description of chemical deliming is proposed, based on the unreacted nucleus approach. Numerical solution of the model is found, concentration fields of the reacting chemicals described, and the evolution of the acido-basic boundary inside calcimine shown.
