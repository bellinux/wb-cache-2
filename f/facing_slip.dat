2500|$|In 2006, the {{government}} announced plans for a £45m flyover link directly {{to and from the}} A1 and M1 eastbound. Construction was initially estimated to take place between 2010 and 2015. As of June 2016, the scheme has no projected completion ydate. In 2011 {{the government}} announced plans for two service areas in each direction between junction 3 and junction 6 near Ballyskeagh. These service stations are the first motorway service stations in Northern Ireland. They include petrol stations and restaurant facilities. Construction on the westbound service area began in November 2013 and was opened on 10 March 2016. Work on the eastbound service area began in April 2016 and was opened on 2 February 2017. The government also have plans to add west <b>facing</b> <b>slip</b> roads at junction 3. Junction 3 opened in 1988 with only east <b>facing</b> <b>slip</b> roads. Construction on the west <b>facing</b> <b>slip</b> roads is subject to future budget settlements.|$|E
40|$|Trifolium repens, Lotus pedunculatus and Holcus lanatus were oversown on {{two recent}} soil slip {{surfaces}} at AgResearch’s Ballantrae pastoral hill‐country farm near Woodville. The two slip surfaces were located on (Manamahu steepland soil) sedimentary mudstone. One slip had a north aspect {{and the other}} had a south aspect. Both slips were located on a land class 6 with slope 28 ‐ 330. The pasture species were oversown during early spring and the percentage seedling emergence and early establishment from viable seeds oversown was analysed at early spring (Day 15), late spring (Day 45), early summer (Day 90), and late summer (Day 120). The slip surfaces showed micro‐climatic extremes {{in terms of both}} soil moisture and surface temperatures during the summer period. Significant differences (P < 0. 05) were found in soil moisture between north and south <b>facing</b> <b>slip</b> surfaces. Higher soil moisture and lower soil mean temperature were recorded on the south aspect slip surface. Significant differences (P < 0. 05) were found between the three pasture species in terms of seedling emergence and early establishment. Significant differences (P < 0. 05) were also found with aspect. The south aspect slip surface had a higher percentage of seedling emergence and earlier establishment for all the species. Interaction between species by aspect became significantly different (P < 0. 05) at Day 90 and Day 120. The main effects of time and species were also significantly different (P < 0. 05) illustrating seedling emergence and establishment as a race against time. Trifolium repens was a more successful pasture specie, than L. pedunculatus and H. lanatus due to its higher consistency on both north and south slip surfaces. Oversowing T. repens during early spring is a viable option for rehabilitation of recent soil slips in Manawatu...|$|E

40|$|The {{deformation}} of single crystals of niobium purified by annealing in ultra-high vacua is studied. The stress-strain curves have 3 stages of hardening {{similar to those}} of f. c. c. crystals. The early stages of deformation are characterised by wavy slip lines on the top <b>face</b> and straight <b>slip</b> lines on the side <b>face.</b> <b>Slip</b> takes place on { 011 } or { 121 } planes, depending on the orientation of the crystal. The results of the orientation dependence of the operating slip planes show that the critical resolved shear stresses for slip on { 011 } planes and on { 121 } planes differ from each other, and that the latter depends on the sense of slip. The asymmetry of slip on { 121 } planes can be explained in terms of the 3 -fold dissociation of screw dislocations. This mode of dissociation also explains the large lattice friction stress, its temperature dependence, and the elongation of glide loops along the Burgers vector direction...|$|R

5|$|Barchans or {{crescent}} dunes {{are produced}} by wind acting on desert sand; the two horns of the crescent and the <b>slip</b> <b>face</b> point downwind. Sand blows over the upwind face, which stands at about 15 degrees from the horizontal, and falls onto the <b>slip</b> <b>face,</b> where it accumulates up to the angle of repose of the sand, which is about 35 degrees. When the <b>slip</b> <b>face</b> exceeds the angle of repose, the sand avalanches, which is a nonlinear behaviour: the addition of many small amounts of sand causes nothing much to happen, but then {{the addition of a}} further small amount suddenly causes a large amount to avalanche. Apart from this nonlinearity, barchans behave rather like solitary waves.|$|R

40|$|Journal articleSediment {{transport}} {{on the lee}} {{sides of}} aeolian dunes involves a combination of grain-fall deposition on the upper portion of the <b>slip</b> <b>face</b> until a critical angle is exceeded, transport of a portion of those sediments down the <b>slip</b> <b>face</b> by grain flows and, finally, deposition at an angle of repose. We measured the mean critical and repose angles {{and the rate of}} slip-face avalanching using terrestrial laser scanning (TLS) on two barchans of different size in Jericoacoara, Brazil. Wind speeds and sand fluxes were measured simultaneously at the dune crests. We found that the mean critical decreased with increasing wind speed. We attribute this effect to turbulent shear stresses, the magnitude of which we quantified using 3 -D large eddy simulation modeling, that randomly act down the <b>slip</b> <b>face</b> (i. e., in the direction of gravity) to trigger grain flows at lower angles than would be possible with gravity stresses alone. We developed and tested a new predictive model for the frequency of avalanching that depends on both the sediment flux delivered to the <b>slip</b> <b>face</b> and changes in the critical angle with time. In this model, increasing turbulent shear stresses drive avalanching {{even in the absence of}} sand flux delivered to the <b>slip</b> <b>face</b> if the critical angle decreases below the slope angle. We also document that the mean critical angle decreases slightly with increasing slip-face height. These results have important implications for aeolian dune evolution, interpretations of aeolian stratigraphy, and granular mechanics. NS...|$|R
60|$|Why this panic? Who {{would have}} harmed me?

Attracted by all this racket and hubbub in the street, she was protruding her round head out of her precincts. Like fox to its hole, I scrambled over her wooden doorstep, whisked round her person, and fled for sanctuary into her shop.
