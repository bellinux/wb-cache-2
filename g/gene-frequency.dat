40|$|Seasonal {{patterns}} of allozyme variation are examined for 12 polymorphic enzyme loci in Drosophila melanogaster. The data derive from {{a total of}} 56 samples taken from a natural population in the Summer and Fall of 1978 and 1979. Samples were obtained at approximately five-day intervals and assayed for 6 -phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (6 Pgd), phosphoglucomutase (Pgm) and glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 6 pd). The remaining nine enzymes were assayed in an average of eight samples per season. None of the loci exhibit regular seasonal cycles of <b>gene-frequency</b> change, although 6 Pgd does show significant, but irregular, frequency oscillations. There is also little evidence for <b>gene-frequency</b> differences between years, although 6 Pgd is again exceptional in showing significant frequency changes between years. In addition, genotypic frequency distributions are usually consistent with random mating expectations. With the notable exception of 6 Pgd, the data give a strong impression of <b>gene-frequency</b> homogeneity within and among years, despite obvious seasonal changes in climate and {{in the distribution of}} breeding sites...|$|E

The preaxial type 1 anomaly has a strong predilection for the hands and always is unilateral in contrast to postaxial type B where more than one-half are bilateral. The evidence to date, consisting of varying incidences of specific types of polydactyly among American whites, Negroes, and Indians in varying enviroments, suggests different <b>gene-frequencies</b> for polydactyly in each population. The incidence in Indians with 50 % Caucasian admixture suggests that the factors controlling polydactyly are in large part genetically determined.

40|$|Four {{replicate}} {{populations of}} Drosophila melanogaster, two reared on medium supplemented with ethanol and two reared on standard medium, were electrophoretically monitored for 28 generations. During the first 12 generations, allelic, genotypic and gametic frequencies were determined for eight polymorphic enzymes: GOT, α-GPDH, MDH, ADH, TO, E 6, Ec and ODH. Samples from generation 18 and 28 were electrophoretically typed for ADH and α-GPDH. In addition, samples from generation 27 were analyzed {{for the presence}} of inversion heterozygous. —The experimental results showed rapid <b>gene-frequency</b> divergence between control and treatment populations at the Adh locus in a direction consistent with the activity hierarchy of Adh genotypes. <b>Gene-frequency</b> divergence between control and treatment populations also occurred at the α-Gpdh locus, although the agreement among replicates appeared to have broken down by generation 28. No differential <b>gene-frequency</b> change occurred at any of the six remaining marker loci. Furthermore, values of linkage disequilibria among all linked pairs of genes were initially small and remained small throughout the course of the experiment. Taking these facts into account, it is argued that the <b>gene-frequency</b> response observed at ADH is most probably caused by selection at the Adh locus. The gene frequency response at α-Gpdh can also be be accounted for in terms of the effect of ethanol on energy metabolism, although other explanations cannot be excluded...|$|E
40|$|The Sex-ratio {{chromosome}} (SR) is a widespread, multiply inverted rearrangement of the X chromosome {{present in}} {{several species of}} Drosophila. Male carriers transmit mostly X-bearing sperm. In the absence of strong counteracting selection, SR {{is expected to increase}} rapidly to fixation, causing extinction. The present study incorporates a selection-components analysis of SR in laboratory populations, using the closely linked Esterase- 5 locus as a marker. Estimated fitnesses show directional viability selection against SR in both males and females, heterosis for fertility and no significant effects on virility, the male adult component of fitness. Estimated fitnesses satisfy conditions for protected polymorphism and accurately predict <b>gene-frequency</b> trajectories in experimental populations. A model of SR <b>gene-frequency</b> evolution is developed, which incorporates sex-linkage, meiotic drive, viability, fertility and virility selecton.

40|$|Measurements of the electrophoretic {{mobility}} and thermostability of esterase- 6 allozymes {{have been used}} to determine the amount of allelic variation at the esterase- 6 locus in Drosophila melanogaster. We studied 398 homozygous lines obtained from four natural populations. Use of a spectrophotometric assay for esterase- 6 activity has allowed precise quantitation of heat-stability variants. Using these methods, eight putative alleles were detected within the two most common electrophoretic classes. Analyses of F 1 and F 2 progeny show that the behavior of stability variants is consistent with the hypothesis that this variation is due to allelic variation at the Est- 6 locus. Analyses of the <b>gene-frequency</b> distributions within and between populations show (1) that observed allele-frequency distributions do not deviate significantly from those expected for neutral variants, and (2) that there is little evidence for an increase in apparent divergence of the different populations at the genotypic or phenotypic levels when the additional variation detected is considered.

40|$|We {{have studied}} {{allozyme}} variation at 26 gene loci in nine populations of Drosophila melanogaster originating on five different continents. The distant populations show significant genetic differentiation. However, {{only half of}} the loci studied have contributed to this differentiation; the other half show identical patterns in all populations. The genetic differentiation in North American, European and African populations is correlated with the major climatic differences between north and south. These differences arise mainly from seven loci that show <b>gene-frequency</b> patterns suggestive of latitudinal clines in allele frequencies. The clinal variation is such that subtropical populations are more heterozygous than temperate populations.

The remaining two boundaries (through Iceland and Greece) separate descendants of different ethnic or geographical provenance but lack modern linguistic correlates. These findings support a model of genetic differentiation in Europe in which the genetic structure {{of the population is}} determined mainly by gene flow and admixture, rather than by adaptation to varying environmental conditions.

40|$|Without {{restricting the}} {{evolutionary}} forces {{that may be}} present, the theory of fixation indices, or F-statistics, in an arbitrarily subdivided population is developed systematically in terms of allelic and genotypic frequencies.

Therefore, together with the allelic frequencies, the latter suffice to describe population structure. Possible random fluctuations in the allelic frequencies (which may be caused, e. g., by finiteness of the subpopulations) are incorporated so that the fixation indices are parameters, rather than random variables, and these parameters are expressed in terms of ratios of evolutionary expectations of heterozygosities. The interpretation of some measures of population differentiation is also discussed. In particular, F(ST) is an appropriate index of <b>gene-frequency</b> differentiation if and only if the genetic diversity is low...|$|E

This is evidence for the primary importance of short-range interdemic gene flow in shaping the modern gene pools of Europe.

40|$|A {{detailed}} analytic and numerical {{study is}} made {{of the potential for}} permanent genetic variation in frequency-dependent models based on pairwise interactions among genotypes at a single diallelic locus. The full equilibrium structure and qualitative <b>gene-frequency</b> dynamics are derived analytically for a symmetric model, in which pairwise fitnesses are chiefly determined by the genetic similarity of the individuals involved. This is supplemented by an extensive numerical investigation of the general model, the symmetric model, and nine other special cases. Together the results show that there is a high potential for permanent genetic diversity in the pairwise interaction model, and provide insight into the extent to which various forms of genotypic interactions enhance or reduce this potential. Technically, although two stable polymorphic equilibria are possible, the increased likelihood of maintaining both alleles, and the poor performance of protected polymorphism conditions as a measure of this likelihood, are primarily due to a greater variety and frequency of equilibrium patterns with one stable polymorphic equilibrium, in conjunction with a disproportionately large domain of attraction for stable internal equilibria...|$|E
40|$|Three {{approaches}} {{were employed}} to evaluate {{the relative importance of}} geographic and linguistic factors in maintaining genetic differentiation of Italian populations as shown by blood groups and erythrocyte and serum markers. Genetic distances are closer to linguistic than to geographic distances. <b>Gene-frequency</b> change across 12 linguistic boundaries is significantly more rapid than at random locations. The zones of sharp genetic variation correspond to physical barriers to gene flow and to boundaries between dialect families, which overlap widely. However, two linguistically differentiated populations appear genetically differentiated despite the absence of physical obstacles to gene flow around them. The Po River is associated with abrupt genetic change only in the area where it corresponds to a dialect boundary. At most loci the genetic population structure seems affected by linguistic rather than geographic factors; exceptions are the systems that were subject to malarial selection in geographically close but linguistically heterogeneous localities. Gene flow appears to homogenize gene frequencies within regions corresponding to dialect families but not between them, leading to the patchy distributions of allele frequencies that were detected in an earlier study...|$|E
40|$|Genetic {{disorders}} of haemoglobin, {{particularly the}} sickle cell diseases and the alpha and beta thalassaemias, are the commonest inherited disorders worldwide. The majority of affected births occur in low-income and lower-middle income countries. Screening programmes are a vital tool to counter these haemoglobinopathies by: (i) identifying individual carriers and {{allowing them to}} make informed reproductive choices, and (ii) generating population level <b>gene-frequency</b> estimates, to help ensure the optimal allocation of public health resources. For both of these functions {{it is vital that}} the screen performed is suitably sensitive. One popular first-stage screening option to detect carriers of beta thalassaemia in low-income countries is the One Tube Osmotic Fragility Test (OTOFT). Here we introduce a population genetic framework within which to quantify the likely sensitivity and specificity of the OTOFT in different epidemiological contexts. We demonstrate that interactions between the carrier states for beta thalassaemia and alpha thalassaemia, glucose- 6 -phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency and Southeast Asian Ovalocytosis have the potential to reduce the sensitivity of OTOFTs for beta thalassaemia heterozygosity to below 70 %. Our results therefore caution against the widespread application of OTOFTs in regions where these erythrocyte variants co-occur...|$|E
40|$|The {{statistical}} {{assessment of}} <b>gene-frequency</b> data on protein polymorphisms in natural populations remains a contentious issue. Here we formulate {{a test of}} whether polymorphisms detected by electrophoresis are {{in accordance with the}} stepwise, or charge-state, model of mutation in finite populations in the absence of selection. First, estimates of the model parameters are derived by minimizing chi-square deviations of the observed frequencies of genotypes with alleles (0, 1, 2 [...] .) units apart from their theoretical expected values. Then the remaining deviation is tested under the null hypothesis of neutrality. The procedure was found to be conservative for false rejections in simulation data. We applied the test to Ayala and Tracey 's data on 27 allozymic loci in six populations of Drosophila willistoni. About one-quarter of polymorphic loci showed significant departure from the neutral theory predictions in virtually all populations. A further quarter showed significant departure in some populations. The remaining data showed an acceptable fit to the charge state model. A predominating mode of selection was selection against alleles associated with extreme electrophoretic mobilities. The advantageous properties and the difficulties of the procedure are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Microevolution is {{regarded}} as changes in the frequencies of genes in populations over time. Ancient DNA technology now provides an opportunity to demonstrate evolution over a geological time frame and to possibly identify the causal factors in any such evolutionary event. Using nine nuclear microsatellite DNA loci, we genotyped an ancient population of Ade´ lie penguins (Pygoscelis adeliae) aged _ 6, 000 years B. P. Subfossil bones from this population were excavated by using an accurate stratigraphic method that allowed the identification of individuals even within the same layer. We compared the allele frequencies in the ancient population with those recorded from the modern population at the same site in Antarctica. We report {{significant changes in the}} frequencies of alleles between these two time points, hence demonstrating microevolutionary change. This study demonstrates a nuclear <b>gene-frequency</b> change over such a geological time frame. We discuss the possible causes of such a change, including the role of mutation, genetic drift, and the effects of gene mixing among different penguin populations. The latter is likely to be precipitated by mega-icebergs that act to promote migration among penguin colonies that typically show strong natal return...|$|E
40|$|The {{change in}} gene {{frequency}} for two X-linked mutants, y and w, {{in a number}} of experiments was compared to that predicted from a genetic simulation program which utilized estimated differences in relative mating ability, fecundity, and viability. The simulation gave excellent predictions of gene frequency change even when experiments were started with different initial gene frequencies in the males and females or when the two loci were segregating simultaneously. The rate of elimination was slower when there were unequal initial gene frequencies than when males and females had equal initial gene frequencies. Simulation demonstrated that this was a general phenomenon when there is strong selection but that the opposite is true for weak selection. In two other experiments, the mating advantage of wild-type males was balanced by a fecundity advantage in mutant females. In all four replicates of both experiments, the mutant was maintained for several generations at the high initial frequency but then decreased quickly and was eliminated. Results obtained restarting one of these experiments with flies from a generation after the decline in gene frequency indicated that a linked gene and not frequency-dependent selection was responsible for the unpredictable <b>gene-frequency</b> change in the mutant. Using a least squares technique, it was found that a recessive fecundity locus 15 map units from the w locus gave the best fit for both experiments...|$|E
40|$|Both mapping {{quantitative}} trait loci (QTL) and genomic selection (GS) {{contribute to the}} genetic improvement of livestock by combining molecular and phenotypic information. This thesis includes a study on a method to combine linkage disequilibrium (LD) and cosegregation (CS) information to fine-map QTL, a multi-locus measure of LD and its relationship with long-term accuracy of genomic estimated breeding value (GEBV), and an approach to simulate validation data by sampling according to mendelian inheritance to predict long-term accuracy of GEBV. A <b>gene-frequency</b> model is proposed to fine-map QTL that combines LD and CS information, where LD information is incorporated into the conditional means and variances given marker information, and CS information is incorporated into covariances of gametic deviations of the model. Algorithms are developed to draw Bayesian inferences on this <b>gene-frequency</b> model (BGF). The performance of the BGF method was compared to a regression method using least squares (LSR) or the identity-by-descent (IBD) method of Meuwissen and Goddard in power to detect and precision to map a QTL. Simulations were conducted under a range of marker densities, sample sizes and sizes of QTL. When there was only LD information in the data, the BGF method had power close or {{equal to that of}} LSR, and precision higher than that of LSR. The IBD method is another method that combines LD and CS information. When there was LD and CS information in the data, the BGF method had higher power and precision than the IBD method. A multi-locus measure of LD, Rw 2, is proposed to quantify the long-term accuracy of genomic estimated breeding value (GEBV). Scanning through a genome with every SNP chosen to be a surrogate QTL, its genotypes are regressed on all the remaining SNPs, but are predicted using only the surrounding SNPs within a certain length of chromosomal segment. The value of Rw 2 is obtained by averaging the squared correlation between the true and predicted genotypes over all surrogate QTL. The values of Rw were higher than the long-term accuracies of GEBV based on the simulation, which suggests that distant loci from the QTL {{have a negative impact on}} predicting GEBV. Since the measure Rw 2 is too optimistic to predict the long-term accuracy of GS, a new approach is proposed such that effects of the distant SNPs are not disregarded. Validation data was simulated through sampling mendelian inheritance based on the ordered genotypes of a target population. To validate this approach, a simulation study based on real 30 k SNP genotypes of a layer chicken population was compared to the results based on the same population with real data. Combinations of a broad spectrum of genetic architectures with different heritabilities were included in the simulation. Accuracies from real data were within the range of accuracies from simulation for the most polygenic scenario among the eight scenarios studied. Results from real GS practice in dairy cattle and layer chicken industry substantiated that the polygenic scenario well approximated the genetic architectures of many complex traits...|$|E

The observed distribution of allele frequencies was U-shaped in all of the 138 populations (mostly species or subspecies) examined and generally agreed with the theoretical distribution expected under the mutation-drift hypothesis, though there was a significant excess of rare alleles (gene frequency, 0 ∼ 0. 05) in about a quarter of the populations. The agreement between the mutation-drift theory and observed data was quite satisfactory for the numbers of polymorphic (gene frequency, 0. 05 ∼ 0. 95) and monomorphic (0. 95 ∼ 1. 0) alleles. —The observed pattern of allele-frequency distribution was incompatible with the prediction from the overdominance hypothesis. The observed correlations of the numbers of rare alleles, polymorphic alleles and monomorphic alleles with heterozygosity were of the order of magnitude that was expected under the mutation-drift hypothesis. Our results did not support the view that intracistronic recombination is an important source of genetic variation. The total number of alleles per locus was positively correlated with molecular weight in most of the species examined, and the magnitude of the correlation was consistent with the theoretical prediction from mutation-drift hypothesis. The correlation between molecular weight and the number of alleles was generally higher than the correlation between molecular weight and heterozygosity, as expected...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEvolution and the {{maintenance}} of polymorphism under the multilocus Levene model with soft selection are studied. The number of loci and alleles, the number of demes, the linkage map, and the degree of dominance are arbitrary, but epistasis is absent or weak. We prove that, without epistasis and under mild, generic conditions, every trajectory converges to a stationary point in linkage equilibrium. Consequently, the equilibrium and stability structure can be determined by investigating the much simpler <b>gene-frequency</b> dynamics on the linkage-equilibrium manifold. For a haploid species an analogous result is shown. For weak epistasis, global convergence to quasi-linkage equilibrium is established. As an application, {{the maintenance}} of multilocus polymorphism is explored if the degree of dominance is intermediate at every locus and epistasis is absent or weak. If {{there are at least two}} demes, then arbitrarily many multiallelic loci can be maintained polymorphic at a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium. Because this holds for an open set of parameters, such equilibria are structurally stable. If the degree of dominance is not only intermediate but also deme independent, and loci are diallelic, an open set of parameters yielding an internal equilibrium exists only if the number of loci is strictly less than the number of demes. Otherwise, a fully polymorphic equilibrium exists only nongenerically, and if it exists, it consists of a manifold of equilibria. Its dimension is determined. In the absence of genotype-by-environment interaction, however, a manifold of equilibria occurs for an open set of parameters. In this case, the equilibrium structure is not robust to small deviations from no genotype-by-environment interaction. In a quantitative-genetic setting, the assumptions of no epistasis and intermediate dominance are equivalent to assuming that in every deme directional selection acts on a trait that is determined additively, i. e., by nonepistatic loci with dominance. Some of our results are exemplified in this quantitative-genetic context...|$|E
40|$|Subsequent {{chapters}} {{in this volume}} deal with populations as dynamic entities in time and space. Populations are, of course, made up of individuals, and the parameters which characterize aggregate behavior-population growth rate and so on-ultimately derive from the behavioral ecology and life-history strategies of these constituent individuals. In evolutionary terms, the properties of populations can only {{be understood in terms}} of individuals, which comes down to studying how life-history choices (and consequent <b>gene-frequency</b> distributions) are shaped by environmental forces. Many important aspects of group behavior-from alarm calls of birds and mammals to the complex institutions that have enabled human societies to flourish- flourishpose problems of how cooperative behavior can evolve and be maintained. The puzzle was emphasized by Darwin, and remains the subject of active research today. In this book, we leave the large subject of individual organisms' behavioral ecology and life-history choices to texts in that field (e. g. Krebs and Davies, 1997). Instead, we lead with a survey of work, much of it very recent, on five different kinds of mechanism whereby cooperative behavior may be maintained in a population, despite the inherent difficulty that cheats may prosper by enjoying the benefits of cooperation without paying the associated costs. Cooperation means that a donor pays a cost, c, for a recipient to get a benefit, b. In evolutionary biology, cost and benefit are measured in terms of fitness. While mutation and selection represent the main forces of evolutionary dynamics, cooperation is a fundamental principle that is required for every level of biological organization. Individual cells rely on cooperation among their components. Multicellular organisms exist because of cooperation among their cells. Social insects are masters of cooperation. Most aspects of human society are based on mechanisms that promote cooperation. Whenever evolution constructs something entirely new (such as multicellularity or human language), cooperation is needed. Evolutionary construction is based on cooperation. The five rules for cooperation which we examine in this chapter are: kin selection, direct reciprocity, indirect reciprocity, graph selection, and group selection. Each of these can promote cooperation if specific conditions are fulfilled...|$|E
