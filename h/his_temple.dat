5|$|Aurelian {{spared the}} city and {{stationed}} a garrison of 600 archers, led by Sandarion, as a peacekeeping force. In 273 Palmyra rebelled {{under the leadership of}} Septimius Apsaios, declaring Antiochus (a relative of Zenobia) as Augustus. Aurelian marched against Palmyra, razing it to the ground and seizing the most valuable monuments to decorate <b>his</b> <b>Temple</b> of Sol. Palmyrene buildings were smashed, residents massacred and the Temple of Bel pillaged.|$|E

He had shot Nevill in the bedroom too, but Nevill was able to get downstairs where he and Bamber fought in the kitchen, before Bamber shot him four times, twice in <b>his</b> <b>temple</b> and twice into the top of his head. He had shot Sheila in the main bedroom, next to her mother, and had shot the children in their beds as they slept.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{the actions}} of this tengu were portrayed as another attempt by demons to throw the world into chaos and war, but as Yoshitsune's renown as a legendary warrior increased, his monstrous teacher came to be {{depicted}} {{in a much more}} sympathetic and honorable light. In {{one of the most famous}} renditions of the story, the Noh play Kurama Tengu, Ushiwaka is the only person from <b>his</b> <b>temple</b> who does not give up an outing in disgust at the sight of a strange yamabushi. Sōjōbō thus befriends the boy and teaches him out of sympathy for his plight.|$|E
5|$|Criminal mastermind the Hood (voiced by Ray Barrett) is telepathically {{linked to}} his half-brother, Kyrano (David Graham), the manservant on Tracy Island. Abusing this {{connection}} and inflicting severe psychological trauma on his sibling, he discovers that International Rescue – the Tracy family's newly formed life-saving organisation – {{is ready to}} start operations. Determined to steal the secrets of IR's Thunderbird machines, the Hood plots to have the Tracys called to a disaster situation of his own design. Travelling from <b>his</b> <b>temple</b> hideout in the Malaysian jungle to London International Airport, he plants a bomb next to the landing gear hydraulics of Air Terrainean's new Fireflash – an atomic-powered, hypersonic airliner departing for her maiden flight to Tokyo. One of the passengers is Kyrano's daughter, Tin-Tin. In an anonymous videophone call to London Tower, the Hood warns Commander Norman of Air Traffic Control that the motion-sensitive device will detonate from the impact of landing.|$|E
5|$|Li Yuan, {{known as}} Emperor Gaozu of Tang, ruled until 626, {{when he was}} forcefully deposed by his son Li Shimin, the Prince of Qin. Li Shimin had {{commanded}} troops {{since the age of}} 18, had prowess with bow and arrow, sword and lance and was known for his effective cavalry charges. Fighting a numerically superior army, he defeated Dou Jiande (573–621) at Luoyang in the Battle of Hulao on May 28, 621. In a violent elimination of royal family due to fear of assassination, Li Shimin ambushed and killed two of his brothers, Li Yuanji (b. 603) and Crown prince Li Jiancheng (b. 589), in the Xuanwu Gate Incident on July 2, 626. Shortly thereafter, his father abdicated in his favor and Li Shimin ascended the throne. He is conventionally known by <b>his</b> <b>temple</b> name Taizong.|$|E

5|$|The Olympics were of {{fundamental}} religious importance, featuring sporting events alongside ritual sacrifices honouring both Zeus (whose famous statue by Phidias stood in <b>his</b> <b>temple</b> at Olympia) and Pelops, divine hero and mythical king of Olympia. Pelops {{was famous for}} his chariot race with King Oenomaus of Pisatis. The winners of the events were admired and immortalised in poems and statues. The Games were held every four years, and this period, known as an Olympiad, was used by Greeks {{as one of their}} units of time measurement. The Games were part of a cycle known as the Panhellenic Games, which included the Pythian Games, the Nemean Games, and the Isthmian Games.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the next}} {{two and a half}} hours, Cho {{returned}} to his room to rearm himself; he mailed a package to NBC News that contained pictures, digital video files and documents. At approximately 9:45a.m. EDT (13:45 UTC), he then crossed the campus to Norris Hall, a classroom building on the campus where, in a span of nine minutes, Cho shot dozens of people, killing 30 of them. As police breached the area of the building where Cho attacked the faculty and students, Cho committed suicide in Norris 211 with a gunshot to <b>his</b> <b>temple.</b> Cho's gunshot wound destroyed his face, obscuring identification of his body for several hours. The police identified Cho by matching the fingerprints on the guns used in the shootings with immigration records. Before the shootings, Cho's only known connection to Norris Hall was as a student in the sociology class, which met in a classroom {{on the second floor of}} the building. Although police had not stated positively at the time of the initial investigation that Cho was the perpetrator of the Norris Hall shootings and the earlier one at West Ambler Johnston Hall, forensic evidence confirmed that the same gun was used in both shooting incidents.|$|E

25|$|After the gunfight, Travis {{attempts}} suicide, but {{has run out}} {{of ammunition}} and resigns himself to lying on a sofa until police arrive. When they do, he places his index finger against <b>his</b> <b>temple</b> pantomiming the act of shooting himself.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{graduation}} from Komazawa, So-on wanted Shunryu {{to continue his}} training at the well known Soto Zen temple Eihei-ji in Fukui Prefecture.

His mother and father stayed on at Zoun-in to care for <b>his</b> <b>temple</b> in his absence.|$|E
25|$|Janus {{presided over}} the {{beginning}} and ending of conflict, and hence war and peace. The doors of <b>his</b> <b>temple</b> were open in time of war, and closed to mark the peace. As a god of transitions, he had functions pertaining to birth and to journeys and exchange, and in his association with Portunus, a similar harbor and gateway god, he was concerned with travelling, trading and shipping.|$|E
25|$|In September 1931, {{after one}} more {{practice}} period and sesshin at Eihei-ji, So-on arranged for Suzuki to train in Yokohama at Sōji-ji. Sōji-ji {{was the other}} main Soto temple of Japan, and again Suzuki underwent the harsh tangaryo initiation. Sojiji was founded by the great Zen master Keizan and had a more relaxed atmosphere than Eihei-ji. At Sōji-ji Suzuki travelled back to Zoun-in frequently to attend to <b>his</b> <b>temple.</b>|$|E
