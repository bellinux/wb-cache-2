500|$|Teetotal and a non-smoker, O'Hara {{rejected}} the Hollywood party lifestyle, and was relatively moderate in her personal grooming. In her earlier career {{she refused to}} appear to smoke and drink on screen, {{and it was only}} later that she relented to avoid being out of a job. O'Hara was considered to be prudish in Hollywood. Malone wrote that [...] "her attitude towards sex bordered on puritanical at times, which wasn't what one expected from a sex symbol". When asked why she would not pose for scantily clad photographs O'Hara remarked: [...] "I come from a very strict family, and I can't do some of the things other actresses can because my folks in Dublin would think I turned out bad", and in 1948 she stated that she wouldn't be photographed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> [...] "Because I don't think I looked like Lana Turner <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit,</b> frankly. O'Hara later commented that [...] "I'm not prudish but my training was strict". She believed that her squeaky-clean lifestyle took its toll on her career. She once said, [...] "I'm a helpless victim of a Hollywood whispering campaign. Because I don't let the producer and director kiss me every morning or let them paw me they have spread around town that I am not a woman, that I am a cold piece of marble statuary" [...] and [...] "I wouldn't throw myself on the casting couch, and I know that cost me parts. I wasn't going to play the whore. That wasn't me". She vented her frustration on not being given edgier roles in an interview with The Los Angeles Times, saying [...] "Producers look at a pretty face and think: 'She must have got this far on her looks'. Then comes along a girl with a plain face and they think, 'She must be a great actress, she isn't pretty'. So they give her the glamour treatment and the pretty girl gets left behind". O'Hara believed that she missed out on a number of roles in some of the classic black and white films because she aesthetically pictured so well in Technicolor productions. Such was her natural beauty that {{she was one of the}} few actresses in Hollywood during her career to not undergo cosmetic surgery, though she had one crooked tooth which she refused to part with.|$|E

2500|$|Bathing Beauty, {{previously}} titled Mr. Coed, starred Red Skelton {{as a man}} who enrolls in a women's {{college to}} win back his swimming instructor fiancee, played by Williams. This was her first Technicolor musical. The studio changed the title of the film to showcase Williams. Almost all of the film's posters featured Williams <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit,</b> though the swimming sequences make up {{a small portion of the}} film. Her date to the premiere at the Astor Theater in New York City was future husband Ben Gage.

2500|$|As she matured, people {{commented on}} Tate's beauty; she began {{entering}} beauty pageants, winning {{the title of}} [...] "Miss Richland" [...] in Washington in 1959.

[...] With the family relocating in Verona, Tate learned that she had become a local celebrity owing to the publication of a photograph of her <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> {{on the cover of the}} military newspaper Stars and Stripes. She discovered a kinship with other students at the American school she attended in nearby Vicenza, recognizing that their backgrounds and feelings of separation were similar to her own, and for the first time in her life began to form lasting friendships.|$|E
2500|$|The {{music video}} of the song kicked off Rouvas' {{successful}} collaboration with photographer and director Yorgos Lanthimos, who {{would go on to}} create the majority of Rouvas' most acclaimed videos over the next two years. Lanthimos won in 2008, the [...] "Off-Cannes" [...] Palme for one of his movies and was nominated for an Oscar in 2010. Similar to some of Rouvas' past videos, the video features sexual content, especially for the time of its release that earned it some criticism, while also making it very popular. It contains four scenes, all on one setting, which is an outdoor patio. The video starts by showing quick flashes of various objects, namely a toy gun, a polaroid camera and photographs, a statue, and beach toys. Throughout the video, flashes of Rouvas singing into the camera can be seen while half-naked, playing around in a small outdoor pool. In another recurring scene, Rouvas' is lying down while shirtless while water continuously spalshes over his torso, while the camera angle is right above him, making it appear as he is being trapped by a glass effect. In {{the second half of the}} video, Rouvas can be seen dancing on the patio wearing an open purple T-shirt. The other scenes feature Rouvas playing around with two young women who have very similar features, although one is blonde and the other is brunette. In one scene, they are dressed in bikinis, feather boas, stilettos and diamond jewelry and are drinking champagne, while in the other they are dressed more casually. Rouvas blindfolds the two women and sends them off to search for him while he is watching. During the bridge of the song, Rouvas places the brunette woman in front of the target and aims to take a shooting stand, finally shooting her with the plastic gun on the right side of her chest. He then picks up a golf club and shoots the ball, while afterward, he is brought to lie down while the same woman stands over him, taking numerous polaroid photographs while he poses both clothed and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit.</b> The video plays with the effects of using fast flashes and off-angle shots in combination with some slow-motion and rewinding shots, such as Rouvas slightly getting out and going fully back into the pool, which is replayed many times.|$|E

50|$|Contrary to {{the popular}} opinion that Annette Funicello {{was not allowed to}} be seen <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bikini <b>bathing</b> <b>suit</b> <b>in</b> these films for AIP (or that she was not even allowed to wear a two-piece suit or show her navel), Funicello does indeed wear <b>a</b> pink two-piece <b>in</b> this very first film, shows her navel <b>in</b> <b>a</b> two-piece <b>in</b> Muscle Beach Party, and wears <b>a</b> bikini <b>in</b> Bikini Beach.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes it is {{the studios}} or {{production}} companies that insist that their actresses do not take part in nude scenes or other appearances.

A sudden bright light had been vouchsafed to Archie, and he now saw an admirably ripe and fruity scheme for ending his troubles.

And what could be simpler, once {{he was at the}} 'phone, than {{to get in touch with}} somebody at the Cosmopolis who would send down a few trousers and what not in a kit bag. It was a priceless solution, thought Archie, as he made his way downstairs. Not even embarrassing, he meant to say. This chappie, living in a place like this, wouldn't bat an eyelid at the spectacle of a fellow trickling about the place <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>bathing</b> <b>suit.</b> They would have a good laugh about the whole thing.|$|E
