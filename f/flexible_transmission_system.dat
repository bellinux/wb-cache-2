40|$|Abstract: An {{adaptive}} fuzzy sliding mode {{control scheme}} is presented in this article. Despite the advantages of {{sliding mode control}} design for uncertain dynamic systems, classical sliding mode control has {{a major problem in}} the form of chattering, produced by the rapid switching used to conduct the state trajectories toward the sliding surfaces. A variety of methods are used to achieve chattering-free motion by smoothing out the switching functions � a fuzzy method is introduced in this article. In the proposed approach, the switching functions are replaced by adaptive fuzzy control signals such that the Lyapunov stability conditions are satisfied. This adaptive fuzzy controller can improve the performance and also eliminate the high frequency chattering in the control signals by preventing the application of large control gains where these are unnecessary, especially when the state trajectories are close to the sliding surfaces. The proposed approach and the classical sliding mode control are both applied to a <b>flexible</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>system</b> and comparisons between these control schemes are shown using simulations. The results confirm that the proposed adaptive fuzzy sliding mode control scheme is a powerful tool for the elimination of chattering and for obtaining smoot...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Transmission {{networks}} of modern power systems {{are becoming increasingly}} stressed because of growing demand and restrictions on building new lines. One {{of the consequences of}} such a stressed system is the threat of losing stability following a disturbance. <b>Flexible</b> ac <b>transmission</b> <b>system</b> (FACTS) devices are found to be very effective in a transmission network for better utilization of its existing facilities without sacrificing the desired stability margin. <b>Flexible</b> AC <b>Transmission</b> <b>System</b> (FACTS) such as Static Synchronous Compensator (STATCOM) and Static VAR Compensator (SVC), employ the latest technology of power electronic switching devices in electric power <b>transmission</b> <b>systems</b> to control voltage and power flow. A static synchronous compensator (STATCOM) is a shunt device of the <b>flexible</b> AC <b>transmission</b> <b>systems</b> (FACTS) family. The STATCOM regulates voltage at its terminal by controlling the amount of reactive power injected into or absorbed from power system.

40|$|A very <b>flexible</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>system</b> for {{voice over}} mobile {{internet}} is proposed. With mobile internet {{a combination of}} a lossy packet-switched network and a wireless link of a mobile network is assumed. The new system allows to adaptively change the speech codec rate, and, thus, the payload of a packet, the number of transmitted packets and the number of used carriers on the mobile link depending on the packet error rate of the packet-switched network, and the downlink quality of the wireless link in a very flexible way. The proposed system is based on the Adaptive Multi-Rate (AMR) speech codec and a systematic convolutional code. Packeting of the speech data is done in such a way, that a packet-loss can be assumed as puncturing of the convolutional code. Thus, the only information that must be transmitted to the decoder is a bad frame indication, defining whether a certain packet out of the set of transmitted packets has been received or not. In a coding experiment the performance of the proposed system is analyzed and compared to a reference system using the G. 711 codec.

A robust solution is obtained that gives good performance results. The capabilities of H techniques are more fully demonstrated on a research civil aircraft model (RCAM) flight control problem. A novel architecture for an autopilot to fly the RCAM along the final approach to landing is designed. Good results are obtained for the autopilot that incorporates controllers designed using both two degree-of-freedom H mixed sensitivity and H loop shaping techniques. In terms of a pre-defined mission scenario the overall results for performance, robustness, ride quality, safety and control effort {{are some of the}} best published, they demonstrate to the aerospace community the applicability and benefits of the methods.;Part II considers discrete time-varying finite horizon control. A number of new results in this area are presented, some being specialisations or extensions of existing finite horizon and time-invariant results, for example, means of computing the finite horizon norm and relationships between symplectic matrix equations and Riccati equations. Furthermore, normalised (coprime) factorisations and controller parameterisation results have enabled the optimum norm for the normalised left factored plant problem to be explicitly formulated. Formulae for a particular class of the problem are presented. A simplifying formula for the solution to the control Riccati equation of the problem is derived and a class of sub-optimal solutions, using non-zero terminal weights, is considered. The controller formulae are applied to a one-degree-of-freedom intercept problem with encouraging results. Robustness to relative lateral position errors and target acceleration perturbations are compared for the zero and non-zero terminal state weight cases.;...|$|E
40|$|This Master's {{thesis is}} focused on the {{challenge}} of developing a control system for stabilizing trajectory tracking of the KONGSBERG PROTECTOR Medium Caliber Remote Weapon Station (MCRWS). The work done in this thesis consists of a detailed modeling of the MCRWS, where the complete control system structure has been analyzed {{in order for us to}} gain an understanding of the control challenges that must be dealt with. Furthermore, this thesis develops a dynamical model of the MCRWS, based on a view of the weapon station as a robot manipulator with a <b>flexible</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>system.</b> This thesis also specifically model the input torque to the dynamical model, consisting of three terms. The first terms is the torque input from the motors which is modeled by developing a dynamical model for the motor system as a mass-spring system, with the transmitted torque to the manipulator system as output. The second term is the motion of the moving vehicle that the MCRWS is mounted on, which is modeled as a disturbance input to the manipulator model of the MCRWS, since the effect from the moving vehicle is uncontrollable. The third and last term is friction. Based on the model of the MCRWS, four different controllers are developed, a feedback linearization controller, two types of passivity based controllers, and finally a backstepping controller. All of the controllers, except one of the passivity based, are then proved to be input-to-state stable (ISS), with calculated ISS supply rates. All of the controlled systems are implemented in Simulink and simulated under the influence of disturbances from the moving base, measurement noise and model errors both in the manipulator and motor system. Simulations regarding the ISS property and the controller's performance regarding this is also performed. Based on these results, we establish that the backstepping controller together with one of the passivity based controllers give the overall best expected performance out of the developed controllers, and the recommendation to KONGSBERG is therefore that these two controllers should be used for further development of the control system for the MCRWS prototype. </p...|$|E
