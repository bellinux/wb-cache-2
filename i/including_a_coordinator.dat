40|$|A good workman never blames his tools' so {{goes the}} old (gender-specific) saying. In {{the field of}} {{agricultural}} information for practitioners and policy makers, several tools under development at CTA are now almost ready for use. In the field of agricultural policy networking, a high-level seminar was held in Entebbe, Uganda, from 6 to 10 November 2000. The meeting, officially opened by the Ugandan Minister of Agriculture, Dr Kisamba-Mugerwa, was attended by 31 participants from all six ACP regions who represented a wide swathe of actors and stakeholders in agricultural policies: decision-makers, policy advisors, academics, researchers, statisticians, NGOs, farmers organisations, donors and information experts. With agricultural policy making being of concern at national and regional levels, the meeting studied papers on each region, plus national experiences from Tanzania and Antigua and Barbuda. With the management of information and communication (ICM) being essential for policy making, the meeting recommended support to improving ICM at both levels, and strengthening ICM capacities. An underlying component here is the exchange of information and experiences - in short, networking. Increased attention should be paid, it was felt, to making more information available on best practices in policy processes in ACP countries and elsewhere, including guidelines, methodologies and networking. The process of determining priority information themes in agriculture (PITA) at national level in all ACP countries will soon be aided by the publication of materials in printed, video and digital form (Website and CD-ROM). This follows a training workshop on the PITA methodology held at CTA in November 2000, where a team of seventeen trainers was set up, <b>including</b> <b>a</b> <b>coordinator</b> {{for each of the}} six ACP regions. The workshop was the penultimate stage of several years of painstaking preparations for the methodology, which aims to embrace the full circle of agricultural stakeholders in defining priority needs. With the development of market information systems (MIS) for small operators in the agricultural sectors of ACP countries being a key aspect of CTA s work in market-led development (itself one of the Centre s five current priority themes), a technical consultation was held at CTA in October 2000. Its task was to decide on best practice principles for an MIS, drawing on experiences with pilot projects in Ghana, Kenya and Uganda. Integration is the key. At local level, the emphasis is on local information as well as punctual feeds from other MIS. That local information should in turn be linked into national and regional systems. All in all, such structures will need alert and informed management, and well-selected and on-tap information topics to be covered in future consultations.

40|$|Background The {{research}} practice gap (RPG) is {{resulting in}} sub optimal health outcomes, unnecessary services and wasted expenditure. There is limited evidence for effective interventions {{to address this}} gap. This thesis {{is in response to}} a request to formulate evidence based recommendations about how to develop a research network (RN) and knowledge translation (KT) in Allied Health (AH) to facilitate research and reduce the RPG. Objectives The aim {{of this study was to}} identify current evidence and main issues, obtain feedback from key stakeholders and formulate recommendations relevant to the development of an AH RN and KT in AH in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) to facilitate research and reduce the RPG. Methods Evidence was obtained from two sources. Firstly, a rapid review of the literature was undertaken to identify current evidence and key issues pertaining to the development of a RN and KT. Secondly, we conducted semi structured and focus group interviews and an on line survey collecting both qualitative and quantitative data. The data were then analysed using thematic analysis and SPSS Software. Results While there was a wealth of literature on RNs in health there was limited information in the literature about the effectiveness of RNs and KT strategies particularly in AH. However, interviews undertaken with key stakeholders and an on line survey produced a rich deposit of data. The main finding was that limited time and competing priorities were the most significant issues that prevented involvement in developing a research network and in knowledge translation, despite research being highly valued. There was an indication that collaboration was very important, in particular between researchers and practitioners and also between and within AH professions. Other strategies identified as important were the need for funding to support the network particularly <b>including</b> <b>a</b> <b>coordinator,</b> to directly involve all AH professions and to operate on a ‘virtual’ basis, in addition, to seek support from leadership, to involve consumers, to implement mentorship and knowledge brokers, to change established practice and to complete development of the RN within two years. Conclusions The data collated has added to the current limited knowledge base. A review of the literature and consultation with key stakeholders indicated that the key strategies that can assist with the development of a RN and KT in AH in the ACT were addressing limited time and competing priorities, enhancing collaboration and obtaining funding support. It is also recommended that the RN should aim to create new knowledge but primarily focus on KT. The RN should directly involve all AH professions driven by a coordinator. This is a challenging task but offers significant potential benefits in particular the implementation of health evidence...|$|E

CS shares characteristics with other collaboration computational tools, such as synchronous and asynchronous support and both group working spaces and a local working space. However, its main purpose differs in that, instead of trying to achieve a single document as the outcome of the joint work of several users, CS aims to achieve a broader objective, which is to register (and to demonstrate) the "path" used to obtain certain knowledge.

40|$|BACKGROUNDThe Whole School, Whole Community, Whole Child (WSCC) model {{provides}} a framework for promoting greater alignment, integration, and collaboration between health and education across the school setting and improving students' cognitive, physical, social, and emotional development. By providing a learning environment that ensures each student is emotionally and physically healthy, safe, actively engaged, supported, and challenged, the WSCC model presents a framework for school systems to evaluate, streamline, implement, and sustain policies, processes, and practices. METHODSThis article examines the essential roles of the school district and of schools in aligning, developing, and implementing policy, processes, and practices to create optimal learning environments that support the whole child. RESULTSThree key factors advance efforts to align policies, processes, and practices. These <b>include</b> hiring <b>a</b> <b>coordinator</b> at the district and school levels, having collaborative teams address health and learning at the district and school levels, and using data to make decisions and build health outcomes into school and district accountability systems. CONCLUSIONSThese key factors provide a road map for successfully implementing WSCC. More {{research is needed to}} determine the extent that coordinators, collaborative teams, and the inclusion of health indicators in accountability systems impact student health and learning. 26440821 PMC 460677...|$|R
40|$|Formation flying of {{multiple}} spacecraft is an enabling technology for many future space science missions.

40|$|The {{underlying}} causes of incident fractures—bone fragility and the tendency to fall—remain under-diagnosed and under-treated. This care gap in secondary prevention must be addressed to minimise both the debilitating consequences of subsequent fractures for patients and the associated economic burden to healthcare systems. Clinical systems aimed at ensuring appropriate management of patients following fracture have been developed around the world. A systematic {{review of the literature}} showed that 65 % of systems reported <b>include</b> <b>a</b> dedicated <b>coordinator</b> who acts as the link between the orthopaedic team, the osteoporosis and falls services, the patient and the primary care physician. Coordinator-based systems facilitate bone mineral density testing, osteoporosis education and care in patients following a fragility fracture and {{have been shown to be}} cost-saving. Other success factors <b>included</b> <b>a</b> fracture registry and a database to monitor the care provided to the fracture patient. Implementation of such a system requires an audit of existing arrangements, creation of a network of healthcare professionals with clearly defined roles and the identification of a ‘medical champion’ to lead the project. A business case is needed to acquire the necessary funding. Incremental, achievable targets should be identified. Clinical pathways should be supported by evidence-based recommendations from national or regional guidelines. Endorsement of the proposed model within national healthcare policies and advocacy programmes can achieve alignment of the objectives of policy makers, professionals and patients. Successful transformation of care relies upon consensus amongst all participants in the multi-disciplinary team that cares for fragility fracture patients. <br/...|$|R
