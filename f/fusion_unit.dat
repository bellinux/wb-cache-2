In this paper, we present {{an approach to}} reduce concatenation mismatch by combining spectral information from two sequences of speech units selected in parallel.

The two unit sequences are "fused" by imposing dynamic constraints defined by the <b>fusion</b> <b>units</b> on the spectral trajectories of the concatenation units. To regenerate the modified speech units, we use a synthesis algorithm based on sinusoidal + all-pole analysis of speech, which overcomes the limitations of residual-excited LPC.

40|$|The fusogenic reoviruses induce {{syncytium}} formation {{using the}} fusion-associated small transmembrane (FAST) proteins. A recent study indicated the p 14 FAST protein transmembrane domain (TMD) can be functionally {{replaced by the}} TMDs of the other FAST proteins but not by heterologous TMDs, suggesting that the FAST protein TMDs are modular <b>fusion</b> <b>units.</b> We now show that the p 15 FAST protein is also a modular fusogen, {{as indicated by the}} functional replacement of the p 15 ectodomain with the corresponding domain from the p 14 FAST protein. Paradoxically, the p 15 TMD is not interchangeable with the TMDs of the other FAST proteins, implying that unique attributes of the p 15 TMD are required when this fusion module is functioning {{in the context of the}} p 15 ecto- and/or endodomain. A series of point substitutions, truncations, and reextensions were created in the p 15 TMD to define features that are specific to the functioning of the p 15 TMD. Removal of only one or two residues from the N terminus or four residues from the C terminus of the p 15 TMD eliminated membrane fusion activity, and there was a direct correlation between the fusion-promoting function of the p 15 TMD and the presence of N-terminal, hydrophobic β-branched residues. Substitution of the glycine residues and triserine motif present in the p 15 TMD also impaired or eliminated the fusion-promoting activity of the p 15 TMD. The ability of the p 15 TMD to function in an ecto- and endodomain-specific context is therefore influenced by stringent sequence requirements that reflect the importance of TMD polar residues and helix-destabilizing residues...|$|R
40|$|Motivated by {{the savings}} in {{communication}} bandwidth and sensor transmission energy, data selection for estimation with {{wireless sensor networks}} is investigated in this paper. Exist-ing approaches to data selection inherently treat sensing and transmission to a central <b>fusion</b> <b>unit</b> as of equal cost. How-ever, energy expenditure in sensing is generally {{a fraction of that}} needed for communication. To alleviate the latter, measurement censoring at sensor nodes is proposed here for data reduction, along with a novel maximum likelihood esti-mator that optimally incorporates knowledge of the censored data model. Furthermore, a closed-form expression for the Cramér-Rao lower bound on the estimator variance is pre-sented. Numerical studies show that the estimator using cen-sored measurements achieves error values that are competi-tive with alternative methods, under various sensing condi-tions, while retaining lower computational complexity. ...|$|E
