50|$|An {{interior}} of a luxurious restaurant is shown. A wealthy gourmet sits at a table adding many sauces and spices to his dish, which is hidden by {{the sheer number of}} condiments (this is the scene shown in the film poster). This continues for a long time, and then we see him <b>hammer</b> a <b>fork</b> to a wooden left hand. He then starts to eat his own hand. In a series of short and violent scenes, we are then shown an athlete eating his lower leg, a woman eating her breasts (this is also shown in the film poster), and the last eater, who is about to eat his genitals. As he realises the presence of camera the man covers his genitals and shoos the camera away with his hand.|$|R

40|$|Background: Peripheral {{neuropathy}} is {{a common}} complaint of diabetes. This study aimed {{to determine the effects}} of 12 weeks combined training with Vitamin D supplement on improvement of sensory-motor neuropathy in women with diabetic neuropathy. Materials and Methods: This clinical trial study conducted on 90 patients were selected and randomly divided into two groups. Finally, 81 adult females with diabetes type II (20 – 55 years old) were interred in this study. The control group had no training, but received Vitamin D. The experimental group received Vitamin D and 12 weeks training program (3 days a week, 60 min/session) including aerobic exercises, strength, and flexibility. Aerobic exercise intensity was set at 60 – 70 % maximum heart rate and resistance training intensity was determined by 10 R. M. Michigan neuropathy questionnaire, reflex <b>hammer</b> and tuning <b>fork</b> 128 Hz used to screening tense of neuropathy (Michigan Neuropathy Screening Instrument) that were used for pretest and posttest. Results: Following 3 months combined training and supplementation with Vitamin D, had observed a significant reduction in numbness (P = 0. 001), pain (0. 002), tingling (P = 0. 001), and weakness (P = 0. 002) in the lower limb and also increases in sense of touch intervention (P = 0. 005), detects the position of the fingers (P = 0. 001) and vibration perception (P = 0. 001) in tissues. Knee reflexes (P = 0. 77) and ankles reflexes (P = 0. 47) did not significantly change after interventions. Conclusion: It seems that taking part in combined training and supplementation with Vitamin D can improve the symptoms of sensory-motor neuropathy...|$|R
