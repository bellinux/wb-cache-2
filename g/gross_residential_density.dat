40|$|Summary. Recent policy {{interest}} in managing local population growth has drawn {{attention to the}} fiscal pressures that population growth imposes on local governments. This paper uses 1985 data for 247 large county areas to determine the separate impacts on local government spending of two dimensions of residential development patterns, the rapidity of population growth {{and the intensity of}} land use as measured by <b>gross</b> <b>residential</b> <b>densities.</b> Based on a regression model that controls for other determinants of per capita spending, this study provides careful estimates of the nonlinear impacts of population growth and population density on three types of local government spending: current account spending, capital outlays and spending on public safety. The study balances the engineering and planning view that greater population density lowers the costs of providing public services by documenting a U-shaped relationship between spending and density; except in sparsely populated areas, higher density typically increases public sector spending. In addition, the results suggest that rapid population growth imposes fiscal burdens on established residents in the form of lower service levels. Many local governments, substate regions and states are showing increasing interes...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Many {{research}} papers {{examine the relationship}} of the built environment on transport behaviour using only one mode of transport. Yet to inform policy makers, a broader examination of transport mode choice across different transport modes is required. Here, associations between urban design attributes and transport mode choices including transport walking, transport cycling, public transport and private motor vehicle use were explored. Methods Secondary analysis was conducted on 16, 890 participants aged 18 years or older who participated in the Victorian Integrated Survey of Travel Activity 2009 - 2010 (VISTA 09) in metropolitan Melbourne, Australia. Adjusted multilevel logistic regression models were used to explore the relationship between urban design attributes and transport-walking, cycling, public transport and private motor vehicle use. Results Taking transport-walking, cycling or public transport trips was positively associated with the housing diversity score and gross dwelling density. Taking private motor vehicle trips was negatively associated with street connectivity, land use mix, local living score, housing diversity score, gross dwelling density and proximity to supermarkets. Conclusion The study found that environments that neighbourhoods with <b>gross</b> <b>residential</b> <b>densities</b> exceeding 20 dwellings per hectare, a well-connected street network, access to 9 or more local living destinations and short distances to public transport services (i. e., ≤ 400 m for bus and ≤ 800 m for train) encourage walking, cycling and public transport use, while discouraging driving. Comprehensive integrated urban planning of transport infrastructure, land use development and service provision is required to create neighbourhoods that support active and sustainable living that allow for a flexible mix of land uses and transport options...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Studies {{involving}} {{the built environment}} have typically relied on US Census data to measure <b>residential</b> <b>density.</b> However, census geographic units are often unsuited to health-related research, especially in rural areas where development is clustered and discontinuous. Objective We evaluated the accuracy of both standard census methods and alternative GIS-based methods to measure rural density. Methods We compared <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> (units/acre) in 335 Vermont school neighborhoods using conventional census geographic units (tract, block group and block) with two GIS buffer measures: a 1 -kilometer (km) circle around the school and a 1 -km circle intersected with a 100 -meter (m) road-network buffer. The accuracy of each method was validated against the actual <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> for each neighborhood based on the Vermont e 911 database, which provides an exact geo-location for all residential structures in the state. Results Standard census measures underestimate <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> in rural areas. In addition, the degree of error is inconsistent so even the relative rank of neighborhood densities varies across census measures. Census measures explain only 61 % to 66 % {{of the variation in}} actual <b>residential</b> <b>density.</b> In contrast, GIS buffer measures explain approximately 90 % of the variation. Combining a 1 -km circle with a road-network buffer provides the closest approximation of actual <b>residential</b> <b>density.</b> Conclusion <b>Residential</b> <b>density</b> based on census units can mask clusters of development in rural areas and distort associations between <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> and health-related behaviors and outcomes.

Data were collected through an extensive housing survey carried out on 1, 485 household residences in 56 wards within 12 administrative units in Lagos megacity. The spatial dimension of <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> in the city generates three unique residential patterns which are low <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> (LRD), medium <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> (MRD), and high <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> (HRD) areas.

The measures of metropolitan and local density are addressed separately. It is suggested that metropolitan <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> serves principally as a surrogate for city size. Markets react to high interaction costs found in large cities by raising density rather than density being a cause of those high costs. Local <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> measures relative location (accessibility) within the metropolitan region as well as indexing the level of congestion. Regressions are conducted to predict commuting time, speed, and distance, by mode of travel on a cross-section of individuals nationally and city by city. The results indicate that <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> {{in the area around}} the tripmaker’s home is an important factor: the higher the density the lower the speed and the shorter the distance.

40|$|Abstract. Since {{the seminal}} work of Jane Jacobs, it has become {{conventional}} wisdom among scholars and professional planners that high <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> and mixed commercial and residential land use reduce street crime.

Higher <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> leads to lower per capita crime rates and ameliorates the criminogenic externalities of commercial activity.

40|$|Municipalities {{sometimes}} reform {{property tax}} schedules {{in an effort}} to increase suboptimal <b>residential</b> <b>densities.</b> One such approach is to reduce the tax rate applied to building values and increase the tax rate applied to land, known as a two-rate property tax (TPT). This paper evaluates the impact of a TPT on <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> in Nashville-Davidson County,Tennessee where a conventional property tax schedule prevails during 2006 – 2007. When land taxes are proportionally higher than taxes on structures, 1. 07 to 1 and 1. 25 to 1 for general and urban service districts, respectively, ex ante simulations suggest that housing density increases by 18 % in general services districts and 83 % in urban services districts. Key words: <b>residential</b> <b>density,</b> spatial lag probit, two-rate property tax. JEL codes: Q 24, R 14. Most municipalities in the United States collect residential real estate property taxes based on a percentage of total assessed property value. These policies place equal value on land and structures, but the taxation of build-ings or structures inflates the perceived cost of improvements, thereby discouraging site improvement and potentially reducing eco-nomic returns (Mathis and Zech 1982). Thus, the landowner can reduce their tax burden by developing projects that use relatively more land than structures. This behavior leads to lower than optimal <b>residential</b> <b>densities</b> (Skaburskis and Tomalty 1997). In response to suboptimal <b>residential</b> <b>densities,</b> researchers have investigated reducing tax rates applied to structures and increasing tax rates on land using a “two-rate property tax ” (TPT) as an alternative to plac-ing equal weight on land and structure taxes. ...|$|R

Attempts to {{quantify}} the effect of urban form on households’ vehicle choice and utilization often encounter the problem of sample selectivity. Household characteristics that are unobservable to the researchers might determine simultaneously where to live, what vehicles to choose, {{and how much to}} drive them.

METHODS: Using multistage proportional sampling methods, a population-based cross-sectional {{study was conducted in}} Nanjing between September and November 2004 (n= 2375; mean age= 13. 9 ± 1. 0 years old; 46. 2 % boys; survey response rate= 89. 3 %). Body mass index was calculated from self-reported body weight and height. Overweight, the main outcome variable, was defined as a BMI ≥ 85 percentile value for age- and gender-specific reference data according to the recommendation for Chinese adolescents. The primary explanatory variable was the <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> of the urban districts. Mixed-effects logistic regression models were used for the analysis. RESULTS: Students in the higher and middle tertiles of <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> had a 2. 17 -fold (95 % CI 1. 41 to 3. 33) and 1. 89 -fold (95 % CI 1. 22 to 2. 92) higher likelihood of being overweight, respectively, compared with those in the lower tertile.

40|$|Since the 1987 Brundtland Report, the {{development}} of urban areas has been considered a key determinant in achieving 'sustainability'. Greater <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> is increasingly advocated for and applied through policy statements {{around the world as}} a way of achieving this goal. Various tiers of New Zealand government are following international policy trends, developing programmes, protocols and strategies that promote sustainability and 'good' urban design practices through intensification, or concentration, within urban areas. Research shows that a policy framework of urban concentration, through greater <b>residential</b> <b>density,</b> is only successful where consumers and providers of housing support its practical application. Confrontation between policy and the market, and the acceptability of greater levels of <b>residential</b> <b>density</b> to residents, can jeopardise a policy's success.

This paper explores this question by investigating how the presence of retail activities in neighborhoods influences the commuting choices of residents {{using data from the}} 1985 American Housing Survey. Having grocery stores and other consumer services within 300 feet of one's residence is found to encourage commuting by mass transit, walking and bicycling, controlling for such factors as <b>residential</b> <b>densities</b> and vehicle ownership levels. When retail shops are beyond 300 feet yet within 1 mile of residences, however, they tend to encourage auto-commuting, ostensibly because of the ability to efficiently link work and shop trips by car. The presence of nearby commercial land-uses is also associated with relatively low vehicle ownership rates and short commuting distances among residents of a mixed-use neighborhood. Overall, <b>residential</b> <b>densities</b> exerted a stronger influence on commuting mode choices than levels of land-use mixture, except for walking and bicycle commutes. For non-motorized commuting, {{the presence or absence of}} neighborhood shops is a better predictor of mode choice than <b>residential</b> <b>densities.</b> ...|$|R

Environmental exposure measures included objectively measured walkability components (<b>residential</b> <b>density,</b> intersection density, land use mix, and net retail area ratio) and perceived attributes (access to destinations, neighborhood esthetics, walking infrastructure, traffic/barriers, and crime safety).
