5|$|Scully is {{approached}} by the Dark Figure, who is {{revealed to be}} a Seraph, an angel who descended from the heavens and fathered four children with a mortal woman. God sent the Seraph to return the girls to Heaven {{in order to keep}} the Devil from claiming them as his own. Scully and Starkey find the fourth girl, Roberta Dyer (Perkins) at Gregory's church. However, Scully sees Starkey's horned shadow, revealing his true origins. Scully tries to help Roberta escape, but the women are confronted by the Seraph. She reluctantly lets go of Roberta's hand, after seeing Emily in place of Roberta, and lets her enter Heaven. Later, Scully tells Mulder they should have been protecting the girls from Starkey, not Gregory. She also believes that they are now <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> they were meant to be.|$|E
5|$|Changes {{may affect}} {{specific}} sounds or the entire phonological system. Sound change can consist of {{the replacement of}} one speech sound or phonetic feature by another, {{the complete loss of}} the affected sound, or even the introduction of a new sound <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> there had been none. Sound changes can be conditioned in which case a sound is changed only if it occurs in the vicinity of certain other sounds. Sound change is usually assumed to be regular, which means that it is expected to apply mechanically whenever its structural conditions are met, irrespective of any non-phonological factors. On the other hand, sound changes can sometimes be sporadic, affecting only one particular word or a few words, without any seeming regularity. Sometimes a simple change triggers a chain shift in which the entire phonological system is affected. This happened in the Germanic languages when the sound change known as Grimm's law affected all the stop consonants in the system. The original consonant * became /b/ in the Germanic languages, the previous * in turn became /p/, and the previous * became /f/. The same process applied to all stop consonants and explains why Italic languages such as Latin have p in words like pater and pisces, whereas Germanic languages, like English, have father and fish.|$|E

This hypothesis was confirmed by Cassini's first two close flybys in 2005.|$|E
25|$|For obvious reasons, the Talmud adds to {{the biblical}} {{regulations}} a prohibition against consuming poisoned animals. Similarly, the Yoreh De'ah prohibits the drinking of water, if the water had been left overnight and uncovered {{in an area where}} there might be serpents, on the basis that a serpent might have left its venom in the water. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> there is no suspicion of snakes, this prohibition does not apply (tosafos, beitzah 6a).|$|E

He observed the nurse's positive reaction {{when he told her}} of a possible exhumation and then had her followed by Georges who witnessed the buying of the compact and the laying of the trap for Jean. The motive was jealousy as Nurse Harrison was convinced by Oldfield's kind manner over several years that he intended her to be his bride.|$|E

25|$|The Moldavians' (as well as Wallachians') {{favourite}} {{military doctrine}} in (defensive) wars was a scorched earth policy combined with harassment of the advancing enemy using hit-and-run tactics and disruption {{of communication and}} supply lines, followed by a large scale ambush: a weakened enemy would be lured <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> it would find itself in a position hard or impossible to defend. A general attack would follow, often with devastating results. The shattered remains {{of what was once}} the enemy army would be pursued closely and harassed {{all the way to the}} border and sometimes beyond. A typical example of successful employments of this scenario is the Battle of Vaslui.|$|E
25|$|July {{began with}} another {{impotent}} showing from the United offense <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> {{the team had}} long ago become accustomed to losing. Despite repeated jaw-dropping heroics by goalie Hamid, United fell behind in Utah to home team Real Salt Lake on a 52nd-minute goal. United seemed resigned to another road loss at Rio Tinto Stadium until Jeffrey scored a header on a stoppage time corner kick to gain the surprise point. That result, however, seemed a distant memory the next week, when United traveled to the Philadelphia Union, and suffered the team's worst loss to that franchise, a 3-0 drubbing with 2 first-half penalty kick goals and a second yellow-card ejection for Opare. starting in place of captain Boswell, who had been beaten {{several times in the}} previous match against RSL.|$|E
25|$|Outbreaks of canine {{distemper}} continue to occur throughout the United States and elsewhere, and {{are caused by}} many factors. These factors include the overpopulation of dogs and the irresponsibility of pet owners. The overpopulation of dogs is a national problem that {{organizations such as the}} Humane Society and ASPCA face every day. This problem is even greater within areas such as Arizona, owing to the vast amount of rural land. An unaccountable number of strays that lack vaccinations reside in these areas and are therefore more susceptible to diseases such as {{canine distemper}}. These strays act as a host for the virus, spreading it throughout the surrounding area, including urban areas. Puppies and dogs that have not received their shots can then be infected if <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> many dogs interact, such as a dog park.|$|E

25|$|The temple stands {{within a}} fort, whose walls are later {{additions}} {{built in the}} 16th century by the Nayaks of Tanjore. The towering vimanam is about 200 feet in height and {{is referred to as}} Dakshina Meru (Southern Mountain). The octagonal Shikharam (crest) rests on a single block of granite weighing 81 tons. It is believed that this block was carried up a specially built ramp built from a site 6 kilometres away from the temple. Huge Nandis (figures of the sacred bull) dot the corners of the Shikharam, and the Kalasam on top by itself is about 3.8 metres in height. Hundreds of stucco figures bejewel the Vimanam, although it is possible that some of these may have been added on during the Maratha period. The main deity is a lingam and is a huge, set in a two storeyed sanctum, and the walls surrounding the sanctum delight visitors as a storehouse of murals and sculptures. The temple is built entirely of granite, interestingly, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> there is no source of granite.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the success}} of Seeley's series Hack/Slash through Image Comics, {{publisher}} Eric Stephenson suggested Seeley write another monthly book. Seeley {{knew he wanted to}} work with Norton again, and the two discussed ideas over the following months, mostly during lunch breaks. Seeley was interested setting a story in a small town so he could write about the kind of crimes that happen <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> people prefer to live far away from each other. Norton was interested in telling a new kind of zombie story, since he felt The Walking Dead had perfected the zombie survival story. They combined the two ideas to create the premise for Revival. They pitched the series as Fargo meets The Walking Dead, using the terms [...] "Rural Noir" [...] and [...] "Farm Noir" [...] to describe the hardboiled detective story set in a small town.|$|E
500|$|The second {{bridge is}} the Cheboygan Bascule Bridge in Cheboygan. This bascule bridge {{was built in}} 1940 over the Cheboygan River {{as the last of}} its kind before World War II.

[...] The initial construction of the structure was delayed when the contractor died, but it was completed in December 1940. [...] It was the second moveable bridge on the site, replacing an iron swing bridge built in 1877. The structure is [...] long, composed of two [...] spans {{on either side of the}} central [...] span; the roadway is [...] wide with four lanes for vehicle traffic.

[...] The Dead Executives were instrumental in the instrumentation of [...] "Beat of My Heart", performing on the bass and guitars. They also mixed and engineered the song; the latter was also conducted by Todd Parker and Grant Conway and assisted by Allan Hessler. It was mixed and recorded at the Foxy Studio in Los Angeles, California. The drums featured on the track was performed by Dean Butterworth while Monique Powell and The Fruit performed backing vocals. The song was then mastered by Joe Gastwirt.|$|E

500|$|The presumed {{soft tissue}} was called into {{question}} by Thomas Kaye of the University of Washington and his co-authors in 2008. They contend that what was really inside the tyrannosaur bone was slimy biofilm created by bacteria that coated the voids once occupied by blood vessels and cells. The researchers found that what previously had been identified as remnants of blood cells, {{because of the presence}} of iron, were actually framboids, microscopic mineral spheres bearing iron. They found similar spheres in a variety of other fossils from various periods, including an ammonite. In the ammonite they found the spheres <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> <b>where</b> the iron they contain could not have had any relationship to the presence of blood. Schweitzer has strongly criticized Kaye's claims and argues that there is no reported evidence that biofilms can produce branching, hollow tubes like those noted in her study. San Antonio, Schweitzer and colleagues published an analysis in 2011 of what parts of the collagen had been recovered, finding that it was the inner parts of the collagen coil that had been preserved, as would have been expected from a long period of protein degradation. Other research challenges the identification of soft tissue as biofilm and confirms finding [...] "branching, vessel-like structures" [...] from within fossilized bone.|$|E
