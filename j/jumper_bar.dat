5000|$|Some card types {{could be}} {{customized}} via a [...] "program cap" [...] (a double rail metal <b>jumper</b> <b>bar</b> with 15 connections) {{that could be}} cut to change the circuit configuration.

50|$|Unlike the {{scissors}} or flop style of jump, where the <b>jumper</b> approaches the <b>bar</b> {{so as to}} take off from the outer foot, the straddle jumper approaches from the opposite side, so as to take off from the inner foot. In this respect the straddle resembles the western roll. However, in the western roll the jumper's side or back faces the bar; in the straddle the <b>jumper</b> crosses the <b>bar</b> face down, with legs straddling it. With this clearance position, the straddle has a mechanical advantage over the western roll, since {{it is possible to}} clear a bar that is higher relative to the jumper's center of mass. In simple terms, the western roll jumper has to raise the width of the body above the bar; the straddle jumper has only to get the thickness ofthe body above it.|$|R
50|$|At {{take-off}} the leg {{nearer the}} bar (the lead leg) is held straight and swung {{into the air}} to clear the bar. At exactly {{the same time the}} hips and body are driven into the air by the take-off leg. As the <b>jumper</b> crosses the <b>bar,</b> the trailing or take-off leg has to be quickly swung up to clear the bar. If this occurs as the lead leg crosses and clears the bar, the lead leg can be driven downwards, helping to keep the athlete's centre of mass closer to the bar (in other words, enabling clearance of a higher bar). This up-down/up movement of the legs can best be described as a scissoring action.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike {{the classic}} {{straddle}} technique, where the take-off foot is [...] "planted" [...] {{in the same}} spot at every height, flop-style jumpers must adjust their take-off as the bar is raised. Their J approach run must be adjusted slightly so that their take-off spot is slightly further out from the bar in order to allow their hips to clear the bar while still maintaining enough momentum to carry their legs across the <b>bar.</b> <b>Jumpers</b> attempting to reach record heights commonly fail when most of their energy is directed into the vertical effort, and they brush the bar off the standards with the backs of their legs as they stall out in mid-air.|$|R
40|$|There {{are several}} methods {{of doing the}} Running high jump. The point common to all methods is to {{transfer}} horizontal velocity into lifting momentum {{through the process of}} take-off, to raise the center of gravity to maximum height, and to make an economical jump. In order to attain good results, it is especially important to master the techniques of preparation for spring and of take-off. In this essay, I choose, among several methods of Running high jump, the scissors jump, which most beginners try, and the belly roll and the Fosbury flop, which are now employed by most jumpers. I analyse these methods with regard to the technique of approach, take-off, movements in the air, and landing. Relaxation is important during the approach of any method. In the scissors jump and the belly roll, the approach is made in a straight line. The angle of approach toward the bar is 60 - 80 degrees for the scissors jump, and 30 - 40 degrees for the belly roll. In the Fosbury flop, the approach is made in a curved line. The preparation for spring is similar in the scissors jump and the belly roll. One stride before take-off, the jumper settles down and with the last stride leans his trunk backward and strikes the ground. The take-off spot of the scissors jump is a little farther from the bar than that of the belly roll. The take-off technique of the Fosbury flop is relatively easy, but at the time the spring is executed, the take-off foot and the trunk must form a straight line and be vertical to the ground. In the scissors jump the jumper must bend the take-off leg against his chest, and his body must be horizontal over the bar. There are several forms of belly roll, in which the <b>jumper</b> clears the <b>bar</b> stomach-downwards. In the Fosbury flop, on the other hand, the <b>jumper</b> crosses the <b>bar</b> back-downwards. In the scissors jump, the landing is made on the take-off foot with the <b>jumper</b> facing the <b>bar.</b> In the belly roll, any style of landing is acceptable. In the Fosbury flop the jumper falls back-downwards. Landing in the high jump is not so important as in the long jump or the triple jump, so long as the danger of injury can be prevented. The present world record for men and the Japanese record for women were made {{in the style of the}} Fosbury flop. The world for women and the Japanese record for men were made in the style of the belly roll. These two methods are regarded as the best and most rational. New records will be created through the development of sports science and the training methods...|$|R
5000|$|An {{effective}} approach shape can {{be derived}} from physics. For example, the rate of backward spin required as the <b>jumper</b> crosses the <b>bar</b> to facilitate shoulder clearance on the way up and foot clearance on the way down can be determined by computer simulation. This rotation rate can be back-calculated to determine the required angle of lean away from the bar at plant, based on how long the jumper is on the take-off foot. This information, together with the jumper's speed in the curve, can be used to calculate the radius of the curved part of the approach. This is a lot of work and requires measurements of running speed and time of take-off foot on the ground. However, one can work in the opposite direction by assuming an approach radius and watching the resulting backward rotation. This only works if some basic rules are followed in how one executes the approach and take-off. [...] Drills can be practiced to solidify the approach. One drill is to run in a straight line (the linear part of the approach) and then run two to three circles spiraling into one another. Another is to run or skip a circle of any size, two to three times in a row. It is important to train to leap upwards without first leaning into the bar, allowing the momentum of the J approach to carry the body across the bar.|$|R
