40|$|A new {{fish farming}} {{system based on}} the {{improvement}} of product values and energy saving and supported by a newly designed wave-energy pump has been developed. An experimental approach to the realisation of single-and double-acting wave-energy pumps and fish meat improvement by giving a suitable motion to the cultivated fish was taken. The correlation of motion speed and period with body muscle and fatness of the cultivated fish with low-temperature preservation characteristics was investigated, and the "jogging effect" was proven most effective at a speed of 2. 5 BL/s. Furthermore, system investigations related to wave-energy pumps and fish training were performed in an integrated and optimum arrangement.

50|$|The gun's barrel {{slid back}} on rollers, {{including}} a {{set at the}} muzzle, when the shot was fired. The barrel was attached near the breech to a piston rod extending into an oil-filled cylinder placed just underneath the gun. When the barrel recoiled, the piston was pulled back by the barrel's recoil and thus pushed the oil through a small orifice and into a second cylinder placed underneath. That second cylinder contained a freely <b>floating</b> <b>piston</b> which separated the surging oil from a confined volume of compressed air. During the barrel's recoil the <b>floating</b> <b>piston</b> was forced forward by the oil, compressing the air even further. This action absorbed the recoil progressively as the internal air pressure rose and, {{at the end of}} recoil, generated a strong but decreasing back pressure that returned the gun forward to its original position. The smoothness of this system had no equal in 1897, and for at least another ten years. Each recoil cycle on the French 75, including the return forward, lasted about two seconds, permitting a maximum attainable firing rate of about 30 rounds per minute.|$|E
50|$|A thermo{{hydrometer}} is a hydrometer {{that has}} a thermometer enclosed in the float section. For measuring the density of petroleum products, such as fuel oils, the specimen is usually heated in a temperature jacket with a thermometer placed behind it since density is dependent on temperature. Light oils are placed in cooling jackets, typically at 15 °C.Very light oils with many volatile components are measured in a variable volume container using a <b>floating</b> <b>piston</b> sampling device to minimize light end losses.|$|E
50|$|A {{compressed}} gas accumulator {{consists of a}} cylinder with two chambers that are separated by an elastic diaphragm, a totally enclosed bladder, or a <b>floating</b> <b>piston.</b> One chamber contains hydraulic fluid and {{is connected to the}} hydraulic line. The other chamber contains an inert gas under pressure (typically nitrogen) that provides the compressive force on the hydraulic fluid. Inert gas is used because oxygen and oil can form an explosive mixture when combined under high pressure. As the volume of the {{compressed gas}} changes, the pressure of the gas (and the pressure on the fluid) changes inversely.|$|E

50|$|In use, the {{diaphone}} {{was generally}} {{found to be}} reliable and suffered little from wear, as the lightweight <b>piston</b> <b>floated</b> on a cushion of air during oscillation. Such wear as did occur tended to happen {{as a result of}} the piston becoming loose: as the pistons were custom-made and the design to some degree affected the individual sound characteristics of the signal, the manufacturers supplied two spare pistons with each diaphone.|$|R
50|$|The {{metal bellows}} {{accumulators}} function similarly to the compressed gas type, except the elastic diaphragm or <b>floating</b> <b>piston</b> {{is replaced by}} a hermetically sealed welded metal bellows. Fluid may be internal or external to the bellows. The advantages to the metal bellows type include exceptionally low spring rate, allowing the gas charge to do all the work with little change in pressure from full to empty, and a long stroke relative to solid (empty) height, which gives maximum storage volume for a given container size. The welded metal bellows accumulator provides an exceptionally high level of accumulator performance, and can be produced with a broad spectrum of alloys resulting in a broad range of fluid compatibility. Another advantage to this type {{is that it does not}} face issues with high pressure operation, thus allowing more energy storage capacity.|$|E
50|$|The tubular cradle pivoted by the {{trunnions}} {{supported the}} barrel - a wire bound A tube - and connected {{it to the}} hydro-pneumatic recoil system with a <b>floating</b> <b>piston</b> (the first British use of this) and hydraulic buffer. However, the initial design suffered from excessive recoil and was modified in 1916. In 1917 the recoil was further improved by addition of a recoil indicator and cut-off gear. Full recoil (40-inch Mk I, 44-inch Mk II) was allowed at lower elevation, hence absorbing most of the horizontal (i.e. backward) force. A shorter recoil (23-inch Mk I, 20-inch Mk II) was allowed at high elevation where the ground itself could absorb much of the vertical (i.e. downward) recoil force. This prevented the breech from hitting the platform. The barrel had to be depressed 3° for loading, {{as can be seen}} in the photograph, shown below, of a howitzer of the Australian 55th Siege Battery.|$|E

5000|$|The {{principal}} design {{alternative to}} the twin-tube form has been the mono-tube shock absorber which was considered a revolutionary advancement when it appeared in the 1950s. As its name implies, the mono-tube shock, {{which is also a}} gas-pressurized shock and also comes in a coilover format, consists of only one tube, the pressure tube, though it has two pistons. These pistons are called the working piston and the dividing or <b>floating</b> <b>piston,</b> and they move in relative synchrony inside the pressure tube in response to changes in road smoothness. The two pistons also completely separate the shock's fluid and gas components. The mono-tube shock absorber is consistently a much longer overall design than the twin-tubes, making it difficult to mount in passenger cars designed for twin-tube shocks. However, unlike the twin-tubes, the mono-tube shock can be mounted either way— it does not have any directionality. [...] It also does not have a compression valve, whose role has been taken up by the dividing piston, and although it contains nitrogen gas, the gas in a mono-tube shock is under high pressure (260-360 p.s.i. or so) which can actually help it to support some of the vehicle's weight, something which no other shock absorber is designed to do.|$|E
5000|$|Two Special Edition {{versions}} of the Z31 generation model were produced; a 50th Anniversary Edition celebrated the company's semi-centennial in 1984 and offered additional luxury features, and a [...] "Shiro Special", released four years later, with performance-oriented upgrades. Unlike its predecessors, the Z31 featured a V6 engine in the 200Z/ZS/ZG, 300ZX and 300ZR, and the only Z31 to come with an Inline 6 cylinder engine was the Fairlady 200ZR which was only available in Japan.

The engine was either a type A or type B sub-designation from 1984 to March 1987, while models from April 1987 to 1989 had a W sub-designation. The W-series engines featured redesigned water jackets for additional cooling, and fully <b>floating</b> <b>piston</b> wrist pins. The 1984 to 1987 turbo models featured a Garrett T3 turbocharger with a 7.8:1 compression ratio, whereas 1988 to 1989 models featured a low inertia T25 turbocharger with an increased 8.3:1 compression ratio and slightly more power—165 hp naturally aspirated and [...] turbocharged. Finally, these engines were equipped with self-adjusting hydraulic valve lifters. The transmissions were a 5-speed manual or an optional 4-speed automatic (all Z31 automatics were the E4N71B equipped with torque-converter lockup including turbo models). All Z31s were equipped with a Nissan R200 rear differential, April 1987 and later turbo models received an R200 clutch limited-slip differential except 1988 Shiro Specials which had a Viscous-type limited slip.

40|$|A need {{exists for}} small, robust, and {{efficient}} cryocoolers {{operating in the}} 25 - 100 K range; however, while technological advances have enabled the development of such machines, {{a greater understanding of}} the losses affecting their performance is needed to make informed design tradeoffs. This thesis takes steps to provide this understanding by examining several losses {{in the context of a}} multi-stage cryocooler being developed by MIT and Advanced Mechanical Technologies, Inc. Based on a modular Collins-type design, this cryocooler will use computer-controlled <b>floating</b> <b>piston</b> expanders to simultaneously provide 20 and 100 Watts of cooling at 25 and 100 K, respectively. The contributions in this thesis can be divided into two broad categories. The first is concerned with the systems-level efficiency of the cryocooler, and addresses a significant inefficiency caused by an inherent cooler-to-load temperature mismatch. By using an alternative cryocooler configuration with multiple expanders in series, the overall efficiency may be increased by an estimated 24 %. A simple memorizable heuristic was also found to estimate the magnitude of the mismatch loss in a given stage of the cryocooler: the fractional increase in operating power is approximately the base- 10 logarithm of the pressure ratio divided by twice the number of series expanders, assuming a monatomic working fluid. The second area of research focused on the design of the cryocooler's unique <b>floating</b> <b>piston</b> expanders. A variety of losses affect the performance of these expanders; these range from the obvious to the obscure (e. g., the enhanced "shuttle" heat transfer that arises from reciprocating piston motion) and often favor conflicting design choices. Eleven such losses are discussed along with both existing literature and a new analysis of fluid flow and heat transfer in the piston-cylinder gap. A numerical model incorporating six of these losses was used to gain considerable insight into the design tradeoffs involved in expander design and provide preliminary support for the multi-expander designs discussed earlier. The simulations also challenged a previous design guideline for the piston's stroke length and, unexpectedly, revealed that imperfect expansion and compression can yield a net increase in expander efficiency due to the importance of shuttle heat transfer. by Martin Alan Segado.

2500|$|A {{floating}} caliper (also called a [...] "sliding caliper") moves {{with respect to}} the disc, along a line parallel to the axis of rotation of the disc; a piston {{on one side of the}} disc pushes the inner brake pad until it makes contact with the braking surface, then pulls the caliper body with the outer brake pad so pressure is applied to both sides of the disc. <b>Floating</b> caliper (single <b>piston)</b> designs are subject to sticking failure, caused by dirt or corrosion entering at least one mounting mechanism and stopping its normal movement. This can lead to the caliper's pads rubbing on the disc when the brake is not engaged or engaging it at an angle. Sticking can result from infrequent vehicle use, failure of a seal or rubber protection boot allowing debris entry, dry-out of the grease in the mounting mechanism and subsequent moisture incursion leading to corrosion, or some combination of these factors. Consequences may include reduced fuel efficiency, extreme heating of the disc or excessive wear on the affected pad. A sticking front caliper may also cause steering vibration.|$|R
5000|$|The {{contract}} for the U.S. Carbine cited 14 patents {{as part of its}} design. Four of these were held by Williams as an assignor of Western Cartridge Company (Winchester).

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a feasibility {{study of the}} proposed liquid piston Stirling cooler or LPSC, which is a 4 -cylinder double-acting alpha-type Stirling machine capable of utilising a heat input to produce a cooling effect. The novel aspects of the work include: (a) the first known experimental results of the two heater-LPSC configuration, and the associated performance predictions from a validated third order computer model; (b) development of two independent methods for obtaining the system’s operational frequency; (c) evidence and quantification of the Rayleigh-Taylor instability in reciprocating liquid pistons, and the mitigation of this instability via the use of piston floats; and finally (d) the development of design constraints and recommendations specific to the LPSC. The LPSC is a tri-thermal, thermo-mechanical, free-piston system based on the Siemens-Stirling configuration first proposed in the late 1970 s. A test-rig was constructed and used {{as part of an}} experimental investigation into understanding the complex multi-degree of freedom system and identifying its feasibility for heat-powered cooling applications. In its current, un-optimised state, it has proven to be functional over a wide range of mean gas pressures (1 bar– 6 bar) and relatively low heat source temperatures (80 °C– 150 °C). A third order model of the LPSC was constructed in the computer modelling software, Sage. The model encompasses the complex system dynamics and heat transfer characteristics and is validated against experimental results. The model was used to predict a more optimised piston geometry which led to the first tangible cooling effect in subsequent experiments, in the range of 5 °C below ambient. Evidence of a liquid piston acceleration limit, likely resulting from the Rayleigh-Taylor (RT) instability phenomenon, is consistently observed during the experiments. The use of submerged polyethylene <b>piston</b> <b>floats</b> is found to increase surface stability and enable maximum accelerations of 25 m/s² to 30 m/s². The two heater configuration, with two adjacent heated spaces connected in series with two adjacent absorber spaces, is shown to be the optimal configuration for cooling performance, with relative phase angles close to 90 ° and a conversion ratio of heater gas pressure amplitude to absorber gas pressure amplitude of 1. 02 to 1. When considering test-rig performance at 150 °C heater temperature and a maximum charge pressure of 6 bar, the Sage model predicts a thermal COP of 0. 53 for the current set-up (19. 3 mm diameter, 94 cm long liquid water pistons). This rises to 0. 59 with the installation of 23 mm diameter, 3 m long liquid pistons. When the working gas in the model is replaced with hydrogen, the performance of the LPSC increases significantly: the COP increases by 2. 7 %, to 0. 6, the cooling capacity increases by 59. 1 %, the cold-side temperature in the primary absorber is decreased from 13. 1 °C to 7 °C, and the second law efficiency increases from 5. 3 % to 9. 9 %. A number of design considerations for the LPSC are explored. The existence of a potential piston acceleration limit imposed by the RT instability imposes a constraint on the minimum piston length. A crude capacity evaluation is also conducted, which indicates that a LPSC capable of generating a cooling effect of approximately 5 kW is feasible using 15 L liquid water pistons. Based on the research findings, it is deduced that such an LPSC system is feasible both technically and commercially, although to what extent in either regard is still unknown...|$|R
