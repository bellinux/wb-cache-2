5|$|Denning made {{sweeping}} {{changes to the}} Common Law, with the resurrection of equitable estoppel and his reform of divorce law. A common misconception {{is that most of}} his judgments were overturned in the House of Lords; many were, including the expansion to the doctrine of fundamental breach he set out in Photo Production Ltd v Securicor Transport Ltd, but they let many judgments stand and on occasion agreed with his judgment in situations where he dissented, such as in his final case <b>George</b> <b>Mitchell</b> (Chesterhall) Ltd v Finney Lock Seeds Ltd in 1983.|$|E
5|$|The {{constitutional}} {{history of}} Zimbabwe {{starts with the}} arrival of white people to what was dubbed Southern Rhodesia in the 1890s. The country was initially run by an administrator appointed by the British South Africa Company. The prime ministerial role was first created in October 1923, when the country achieved responsible government, with Sir Charles Coghlan as its first Premier. The third Premier, <b>George</b> <b>Mitchell,</b> renamed the post Prime Minister in 1933.|$|E
5|$|Several {{political}} changes preceded {{the passage of}} the settlement act. First, Senator Edmund Muskie (D-ME)who previously seemed supportive of a settlement, but was gaining national prominence on the issue of fiscal responsibility prior to the 1980 Democratic primarygave up his seat as Chairman of the Senate Budget Committee to accept President Carter's nomination for Secretary of State. Second, Governor Brennan's choice to replace Muskie (and thus inherit his predecessor's committee assignments) was <b>George</b> <b>Mitchell</b> (D-ME)who had supported the land claim as U.S. Attorney and possessed legal gravitas due to his tenure as a District Judge. Another factor affecting the final push for the settlement was the fear that, if Ronald Reagan won the 1980 presidential election, he would veto any settlement favorable toward the tribes.|$|E

The title was changed to Prime Minister in 1933 by <b>George</b> <b>Mitchell,</b> the third man to hold the office. In 1932, the Southern Rhodesian leader was first invited to an Imperial Conference. Although Southern Rhodesia was not a dominion, it was seen elsewhere in the Empire as a sui generis case among Britain's colonies, and worthy of inclusion, particularly {{as it was the}} only one which governed itself. Southern Rhodesian Prime Ministers thereafter became a regular fixture at such meetings and, from 1944, at Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conferences.|$|E
