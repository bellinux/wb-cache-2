40|$|Various standards, {{models and}} best {{practices}} {{are available for}} successful and efficient information technology (<b>IT)</b> service <b>management,</b> {{to be used by}} organizations in planning and deployment of improvements in <b>IT</b> service <b>management.</b> Before introducing the actions recommended by those standards, models and best practices, it is necessary to evaluate the current state of <b>IT</b> service <b>management</b> in the organization. Existing evaluation models and tools for evaluation of <b>IT</b> service <b>management</b> mostly focus only on the evaluation of compliance of <b>IT</b> service <b>management</b> with the requirements and recommendations of standards and best practices covering that field. They do not take into account sociological, technical and other characteristics of the organization being evaluated, nor do they adapt to its business needs and restrictions. This work’s intention is to develop an evaluation framework for an integrated evaluation of <b>IT</b> service <b>management,</b> which includes evaluation of IT services and related processes of <b>IT</b> service <b>management</b> covering technical, sociological and business aspects as well as compliance with standards and best practices. In this thesis we explore existing models and tools for evaluation of <b>IT</b> service <b>management.</b> Using design science research methodology and starting from identified weaknesses of existing evaluation models and tools, we build an evaluation framework which can be adapted to fit the business needs and specific requirements of the organization being evaluated. The framework is intended for integrated evaluation of the current state of <b>IT</b> service <b>management</b> in the organization in question. To obtain a comprehensive evaluation, the framework includes all stakeholders of the organization’s <b>IT</b> service <b>management</b> system. We verify the usefulness of the developed framework with a case study in a selected organization. The management of the organization’s IT department has confirmed the appropriateness and usefulness of the evaluation framework. Using the framework, the management obtained integrated information on current state and possible improvements in <b>IT</b> service <b>management</b> which they were not previously aware of and which could aid in making decisions on further improvements in that area. ...|$|R
