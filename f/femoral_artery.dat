5|$|If a {{cerebral}} aneurysm is identified on angiography, two measures {{are available to}} reduce the risk of further bleeding from the same aneurysm: clipping and coiling. Clipping requires a craniotomy (opening of the skull) to locate the aneurysm, followed by the placement of clips around the neck of the aneurysm. Coiling is performed through the large blood vessels (endovascularly): a catheter is inserted into the <b>femoral</b> <b>artery</b> in the groin and advanced through the aorta to the arteries (both carotid arteries and both vertebral arteries) that supply the brain. When the aneurysm has been located, platinum coils are deployed that cause a blood clot to form in the aneurysm, obliterating it. The decision as to which treatment is undertaken is typically made by a multidisciplinary team consisting of a neurosurgeon, neuroradiologist, and often other health professionals.|$|E

Dr. Ahmed Ghadeel said Jamal had {{received}} multiple wounds from high-velocity bullets striking his right elbow, right thigh and {{the lower part of}} both legs; his <b>femoral</b> <b>artery</b> was also cut. Talal Abu Rahma interviewed Jamal and the doctor there on camera the day after the shooting; Dr. Ghadeel displayed x-rays of Jamal's right elbow and right pelvis. Moshe Tamam, Jamal's Israeli employer, offered to have him taken to hospital in Tel Aviv, but the Palestinian Authority declined the offer. He was transferred instead to the King Hussein Medical Center in Amman, Jordan, where he was visited by King Abdullah. Jamal reportedly told Tamam that he had been hit by nine bullets; he said five were removed from his body in hospital in Gaza and four in Amman.|$|E
5|$|Thus locked together, both captains ordered {{their ships}} to pour fire into the other. So closely aligned were they that many cannon on both ships {{could not be}} run out, and instead had to be fired from inside the ships. The heat from this {{sustained}} bombardment was so intense that the wood began to blacken and burn as heavy roundshot smashed gaping holes in the sides of each ship: during the combat the ragged holes torn {{in the side of}} Hercule were so extensive that the planking between the gunports was torn away, leaving wide scars along the ship's sides. Casualties were heavy on both sides: 20 minutes after the action began a musket ball struck Hood in the thigh, severing his <b>femoral</b> <b>artery.</b> Fatally wounded and bleeding profusely, Hood was carried below and command passed to Lieutenant William Butterfield. The French casualties were significantly higher than the British, a result of the much higher rate of fire achieved by Hood's well-trained crew.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY This study {{investigated}} the effects of altered extracellular Ca 2 + on in vitro femoral arterial smooth muscle responsiveness in deoxycorticosterone acetate (DOCA) -salt hypertensive rats. Compared with controls, <b>femoral</b> <b>arteries</b> from DOCA-salt rats snowed {{a significant increase in}} sensitivity to KCI and norepinephrine in normal Ca 2 + (2. 5 mM). Although no difference in maximal contractile response to KCI was observed between groups, {{there was a significant difference}} in maximal response to norepinephrine. Dose-response curves in low Ca 2 + (0. 25 mM) resulted in a significant decrease in the sensitivity of <b>femoral</b> <b>arteries</b> from DOCA-salt rats to KCI and NE so that the responses were similar to those of controls. Relaxation of <b>femoral</b> <b>arteries</b> from DOCA-salt rats after washout of the KCI contraction was significantly slower than that of controls in both low and normal Ca 2 +. Isoproterenol-induced relaxation of <b>femoral</b> <b>arteries</b> from DOCA-salt rats was signifi-cantly attenuated in normal Ca 1 +. Sensitivity of <b>femoral</b> <b>arteries</b> from DOCA-salt rats to isoproter-enol increased in low Ca 2 +, but maximal relaxation was unaltered. Whereas no difference in maximal relaxation to NaNO 2 was seen in <b>femoral</b> <b>arteries</b> from either group in normal Ca 2 +, a significant decrease in sensitivity to NaNO 2 was observed in <b>femoral</b> <b>arteries</b> from DOCA-salt rats.

Full history taking, clinical examination, resting ECG and serum cholesterol, HDL (non-fasting), fasting LDL, non-fasting non-HDL from special equation, Non- HDL = total cholesterol - HDL and Duplex scanning of both carotid and <b>femoral</b> <b>arteries.</b> Non fasting non-HDL was more than 130 mg/dl in more than 65 % of patients group versus 30 % in control group, serum level of non-fasting cholesterol and non-fasting non-HDL were significantly elevated in hemodialysis patients as compared with control group, while serum level of non-fasting HDL and fasting LDL were significantly decreased in hemodialysis patients as compared with control group.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{synthetic}} 8 -arginine vasopressin (vasopressin) was studied in isolated canine basilar, left circumflex coronary, and <b>femoral</b> <b>arteries</b> of the dog. Vascular rings {{with and without}} endothelium were suspended for isometric tension recording in physiological salt solution. The removal of the endothelium was confirmed {{by the absence of}} relaxations induced by either thrombin (basilar arteries) or acetylcholine (coronary and <b>femoral</b> <b>arteries).</b> In the basilar artery, vasopressin induced concentration-dependent inhibition of myogenic tone. In basilar and coronary arteries, the hormone caused concentration-dependent relaxations during contractions evoked by prostaglandin F(2 α). In <b>femoral</b> <b>arteries,</b> vasopressin caused contraction. After removal of the endothelium, the inhibitory responses to vasopressin were abolished in basilar arteries and significantly reduced in left circumflex coronary arteries. The contractions of <b>femoral</b> <b>arteries</b> were not affected by endothelium removal. The V 1 -vasopressinergic antagonist d(CH 2) 5 Tyr (Me) AVP prevented the inhibitory response to vasopressin, but did not alter endothelium-dependent relaxations of basilar arteries caused by adenosine diphosphate. These results demonstrate that the endothelial cells mediate relaxation induced by vasopressin via specific V 1 -vasopressinergic receptors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

At this time, heparin is given to thin the blood to prevent thrombus from forming while on CPB. The surgeon places a cannula in the right atrium, vena cava, or femoral vein to withdraw blood from the venous circulation. The perfusionist uses gravity to drain the venous blood into the CPB machine, and a separate cannula, usually placed in the aorta or <b>femoral</b> <b>artery,</b> is used to return blood to the arterial circulation.|$|E

A catheter is inserted into a blood vessel, typically the <b>femoral</b> <b>artery,</b> and passed through blood vessels into the cerebral circulation and the aneurysm. Coils are pushed into the aneurysm, or released into the blood stream ahead of the aneurysm. Upon depositing within the aneurysm, the coils expand and initiate a thrombotic reaction within the aneurysm. If successful, this prevents further bleeding from the aneurysm. In the case of broad-based aneurysms, a stent may be passed first into the parent artery {{to serve as a}} scaffold for the coils.|$|E

25|$|Uterine artery {{embolization}} (UAE) is a {{minimally invasive}} procedure for treatment of uterine fibroids. Under local anesthesia a catheter is introduced into the <b>femoral</b> <b>artery</b> at the groin and advanced under radiographic control into the uterine arterty. A mass of microspheres or polyvinyl alcohol (PVA) material (an embolus) is injected into the uterine arteries in order to block {{the flow of blood}} through those vessels. The restriction in blood supply usually results in significant reduction of fibroids and improvement of heavy bleeding tendency. The 2012 Cochrane review comparing hysterectomy and UAE did not find any major advantage for either procedure. While UAE is associated with shorter hospital stay and a more rapid return to normal daily activities, it was also associated with a higher risk for minor complications later on. There were no differences between UAE and hysterectomy with regards to major complications.|$|E
