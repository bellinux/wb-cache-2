5|$|A white dwarf, {{also called}} a {{degenerate}} dwarf, is a stellar core remnant composed mostly of electron-degenerate matter. A white dwarf is very dense: its mass <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> {{that of the}} Sun, while its volume <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> that of Earth. A white dwarf's faint luminosity comes from the emission of stored thermal energy; no fusion {{takes place in a}} white dwarf wherein mass is converted to energy. The nearest known white dwarf is Sirius B, at 8.6 light years, the smaller component of the Sirius binary star. There are currently thought to be eight white dwarfs among the hundred star systems nearest the Sun. The unusual faintness of white dwarfs was first recognized in 1910. The name white dwarf was coined by Willem Luyten in 1922.|$|E

5|$|Brachytherapy {{for skin}} cancer {{provides}} good cosmetic results and clinical efficacy; studies {{with up to}} 5 years follow-up have shown that brachytherapy is highly effective in terms local control, and <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> EBRT. Treatment times are typically short, providing convenience for patients.|$|E
5|$|For example, rhenium diboride can be {{produced}} at ambient pressures, but is rather expensive because of rhenium. The hardness of ReB2 exhibits considerable anisotropy because of its hexagonal layered structure.

5|$|Several teams compete {{annually}} for secondary MLS rivalry cups that are typically contested by two teams, usually geographic rivals (e.g., Portland vs. Seattle vs. Vancouver).

5|$|A cheap, {{cost-effective}} {{and practical}} alternative in poorer countries is visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA). Instituting and sustaining cytology-based programs {{in these regions}} can be difficult, due {{to the need for}} trained personnel, equipment and facilities and difficulties in follow-up. With VIA, results and treatment can be available on the same day. As a screening test, VIA <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> cervical cytology in accurately identifying precancerous lesions.|$|E

5|$|Abduljalil al-Miqdad is a {{prominent}} Shia and political activist, and {{a co-founder of}} Al Wafa'. He resigned from the Bahrain Ulama Council in 2005. The relationship between al-Miqdad and Al Wafa' <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> that of Isa Qassim and Al Wefaq; its unofficial spiritual leader. Sa'eed al-Nori is a religious, political activist and vocal critic of the government, and member of Al Wafa'. He was among the arrested in August 2010. Mohamed Ismail is a political activist with close relations to Abdulwahab Hussain.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the concept}} of chakra appears in the Indian mythology {{as well as in}} Buddhism and in some other belief systems, when asked in an interview, Kishimoto claimed that none of these {{influences}} were the basis for his use of the concept in Naruto. He further asserted that it was a term to apply a concrete definition to the ninjas' ability to use jutsu in the series and <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> the Force in Star Wars or to magic points in role-playing games.|$|E
5|$|Chaucer's Criseyde is {{swayed by}} Diomedes playing on her fear. Pandarus is now her uncle, more worldly-wise and {{more active in}} what happens and so Troilus is more passive. This {{passivity}} is given comic treatment when Troilus passes out in Criseyde's bedroom and is lifted into her bed by Pandarus. Troilus' repeated emotional paralysis <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> that of Hamlet {{who may have been}} based on him. It can be seen as driven by loyalty both to Criseyde and to his homeland, but has also been interpreted less kindly.|$|E

As a percentage of dry matter, the fruit bodies contain 39.0% crude protein, 1.4% lipids, 50.8% carbohydrates, and 8.8% ash. The majority of the lipid content comprises oleic (43.9%), linoleic (38.3%), and palmitic (9.9%) fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|Emus are farmed {{primarily}} for their meat, leather, feathers and oil, and 95% of the carcass can be used. Emu meat is a low-fat product (less than 1.5% fat), and <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> other lean meats. Most of the usable portions (the best cuts {{come from the}} thigh and the larger muscles of the drum or lower leg) are, like other poultry, dark meat; emu meat is considered for cooking purposes by the US Food and Drug Administration to be a red meat because its red colour and pH value approximate that of beef, but for inspection purposes it {{is considered to be}} poultry.|$|E
5|$|Gelsomina's {{difficulties}} with her forced partnership {{are the subject}} of frequent soul searching. Before Zampanò's release from prison, Il Matto proposes that there are alternatives to Gelsomina's servitude, and imparts his philosophy that everything and everyone has a purpose – even a pebble, even her.

5|$|In Earth's crust, {{scandium}} is not rare. Estimates {{vary from}} 18 to 25ppm, which <b>is</b> <b>comparable</b> <b>to</b> {{the abundance of}} cobalt (20–30ppm). Scandium is only the 50th most common element on Earth (35th most abundant in the crust), {{but it is the}} 23rd most common element in the Sun. However, scandium is distributed sparsely and occurs in trace amounts in many minerals. Rare minerals from Scandinavia and Madagascar such as thortveitite, euxenite, and gadolinite are the only known concentrated sources of this element. Thortveitite can contain up to 45% of scandium in the form of scandium(III) oxide.|$|E
5|$|Milford Haven {{enjoys a}} mild climate.

M.granulifera differs in forming a whitish, wrinkled cap and club-shaped to roughly spindle-shaped pleurocystidia. Mycena nidificata also bears some {{resemblance to the}} European species M.flos-nivium, which is distinguished by having cylindrical, amyloid spores, gills without veins between them, and an absence of cord-like rhizomorphs.|$|E
