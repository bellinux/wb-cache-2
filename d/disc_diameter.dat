40|$|Background, Retinal neovascularization (RNV) {{has never}} been {{described}} in cases of macular branch retinal vein occlusion (MBRVO), due to the limited amount of ischemia in this form of retinal vein occlusion. Ischemic areas as wide as 5 - 10 <b>disc</b> <b>diameters</b> were required by previous studies to count as ischemic cases of central or major branch retinal vein occlusion. Case report. A 56 -year-old {{woman who had been}} suffering from MBRVO for 3 years presented at the posterior pole a zone of non-perfusion, extending over 7. 5 disc areas, and three small tufts of RNV. RNV regressed after two subsequent laser treatments of the ischemia. Retrohyaloid hemorrhage was observed 2 months after the first treatment. Conclusion. Since the average diameter of the non-perfused area was about 2. 75 <b>disc</b> <b>diameters,</b> this case demonstrates that small RNVs can appear in less extensive areas of ischemia than is generally believed...|$|R

The Hemorrhagic Intraretinal Macrocyst needs to be differentiated from mimicking clinical conditions, namely, retinoschisis, choroidal melanoma, subretinal abscess, choroidal hemangioma, and the like.

40|$|Investigation of {{infiltration}} provides {{insights about}} {{the flow of}} water and transport of contaminants through the vadose zone. Infiltration is governed by prevailing environmental conditions like soil characteristics, plant cover and geologic settings. The main objective was to study preferential flow dominated infiltration at two contrasting hydrologic settings in Texas. For the first study, artificial rainfall was simulated within a plot covered with juniper trees at a karst region of the Edwards Plateau and sub-surface flow was monitored using TDR probes. Sub-surface flow was simulated using HYDRUS- 2 D. Results demonstrated that sub-surface flow occurred in a tri-modal manner, consisting of flow in karst conduits, planar fractures in the limestone, and soil matrix. Both fracture and matrix flow responses increased with increase in rainfall intensity. During large rainfall events, water exchange was observed between the fractures and matrix. Dye studies indicated that fractures and juniper roots were primary pathways for preferential flow occurring within the plot. The model simulated flow characteristics like exchange processes and differentiated between preferential and conduit flow besides determining approximate van Genuchten parameters for each geologic unit. For the second study, tension infiltrometers were used to conduct infiltration experiments at six soil water pressures (?? = - 0. 2 to 0 m) in an agricultural field near College Station over a 21 month period. The aim was to determine steady infiltration rate, if, saturated hydraulic conductivity, Ksat, unsaturated hydraulic conductivity, K(??) and unsaturated flux density ??(??). Moreover, the effect of varying <b>disc</b> <b>diameters</b> on steady state infiltration rates (if) was also studied. Results demonstrated that infiltration occurred in a bi-modal fashion consisting of preferential flow and matrix flow. Macropores and roots present in the soil resulted in gravity dominated flow at ?? = - 0. 05 to 0 m for all experiments. Statistical analysis suggested that the soil did not exhibit spatial variability within the plot and the five different <b>disc</b> <b>diameters</b> had no effect on if. Statistically significant differences in if were observed between 0. 2 and 0. 24 m <b>disc</b> <b>diameters</b> at saturation over the 21 month period.
