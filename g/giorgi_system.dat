50|$|Giovanni Giorgi (27 November 1871 - 19 August 1950) was an Italian {{physicist}} and electrical engineer who proposed the <b>Giorgi</b> <b>system</b> of measurement, the {{precursor to the}} International System of Units (SI).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Giorgi</b> <b>system</b> {{was thus}} the {{precursor}} of the International System of Units (SI) adopted in 1960, {{which was based}} on six fundamental units: metre, kilogram, second, ampere, kelvin, and candela. [...] The mole was added as a seventh fundamental unit in 1971.|$|E
50|$|The {{elections}} were held under a two-round <b>system.</b> <b>Giorgi</b> Margvelashvili was elected {{with a majority}} of votes in the first round.|$|R
25|$|Quite at the {{opposite}} end of the spectrum, in terms of the complexity of the key system developed by Boehm, was the Giorgi flute, an advanced form of the ancient holed flute. Patented in 1897, the Giorgi flute was designed without any mechanical keys, though the patent allows for the addition of keys as options. Giorgi enabled the performer to play equally true in all musical keys, as does the Boehm <b>system.</b> <b>Giorgi</b> flutes are now rarities, found in museums and private collections. The underlying principles of both flute patterns are virtually identical, with tone holes spaced as required to produce a fully chromatic scale. The player, by opening and closing holes, adjusts the effective length of the tube, and thus the rate of oscillation, which defines the audible pitch.|$|R
40|$|Several {{interesting}} {{applications of}} provability logic in proof theory {{made use of}} a polymodal logic GLP due to <b>Giorgi</b> Japaridze. This <b>system,</b> although decidable, is not very easy to handle. In particular, it is not Kripke complete. It is complete w. r. t. neighborhood semantics, however this could only be established recently by rather complicated techniques [1]. In this talk we will advocate {{the use of a}} weaker system, called Reflection Calculus, which is much simpler than GLP, yet expressive enough to regain its main proof-theoretic applications, and more. From {{the point of view of}} modal logic, RC can be seen as a fragment of polymodal logic consisting of implications of the form A → B, where A and B are formulas built-up from ⊤ and the variables using just ∧ and the diamond modalities. In this paper we formulate it in a somewhat more succinct self-contained format. Further, we state its arithmetical interpretation, and provide some evidence that RC is much simpler than GLP. We then outline a consistency proof for Peano arithmetic based on RC and state a simple combinatorial statement, the so-called Worm principle, that was suggested by the use of GLP but is even more directly related to the Reflection Calculus. 1 Reflection calculus RC Basic symbols of RC are propositional variables p, q, [...] ., constant ⊤, conjunction ∧, the symbols n, for each n ∈ ω, and the brackets. Informally, n corresponds to the n-th modality 〈n〉. The formulas α of RC are generated by the following grammar: α:: = ⊤ | p | (α ∧ α) | nα n ∈ ω. Example: α = 3 (2 ⊤ ∧ 32 ⊤). The symbols ⊤ occurring after a number symbol can be omitted without impairing the readability of the formula, e. g., the previous formula can be shortened to 3 (2 ∧ 32). Derivable objects of RC are sequents, that is, expressions of the form α ⊢ β with α, β formulas...|$|R
5000|$|Also in 1936, TC1 passed {{responsibility}} for [...] "electric and magnetic magnitudes and units" [...] {{to the new}} TC24. This [...] "led eventually to the universal adoption of the <b>Giorgi</b> <b>system,</b> which unified electromagnetic units with the MKS dimensional system of units, the whole now known simply as the SI system (Système International d’unités)." ...|$|E
50|$|With {{advances}} {{in the theory of}} electromagnetism and in quantity calculus, it became apparent that a coherent absolute system of units could only include one electromagnetic base unit. The first such system was proposed by Giorgi in 1901: it used the ohm as the additional base unit in the MKS system, and so {{is often referred to as}} the MKSΩ system or the <b>Giorgi</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1938, TC24 [...] "recommended as a {{connecting}} link mechanical to electrical units the permeability of free space with {{the value of}} µ0 = 4π H/m. This group also recognized that {{any one of the}} practical units already in use (ohm, ampere, volt, henry, farad, coulomb, and weber), could equally serve as the fourth fundamental unit. [...] "After consultation, the ampere was adopted as the fourth unit of the <b>Giorgi</b> <b>system</b> in Paris in 1950." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{choice of}} {{electrical}} unit for the base unit in a rationalized system depends only on practical considerations, particularly {{the ability to}} realize the unit accurately and reproducibly. The ampere rapidly gained support over the ohm, as many national standards laboratories were already realizing the ampere in absolute terms using ampere balances. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted the <b>Giorgi</b> <b>system</b> with the ampere replacing the ohm in 1935, and this choice of base units is often called the MKSA system.|$|E
50|$|The International Electronical Commission {{held its}} inaugural meeting on 26 June 1906, {{following}} discussions between the British Institution of Electrical Engineers, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, and others, which {{began at the}} 1900 Paris International Electrical Congress, and continued with Colonel R. E. B. Crompton playing a key role.The IEC was instrumental in developing and distributing standards for units of measurement, particularly Gauss, Hertz, and Weber. It also first proposed a system of standards, the <b>Giorgi</b> <b>System,</b> which ultimately became the SI, or Système International d’unités (in English, the International System of Units).|$|E
5000|$|During the 19th century, the {{standard}} system of metric units was the centimetre-gram-second system of units, treating the gram as the fundamental {{unit of mass}} and the kilogram simply as a derived unit. In 1901, however, following the discoveries by James Clerk Maxwell {{to the effect that}} electric measurements could not be explained in terms of the three fundamental units of length, mass and time, Giovanni Giorgi proposed a new standard system which would include a fourth fundamental unit to measure quantities in electromagnetism.In 1935 this was adopted by the IEC as the <b>Giorgi</b> <b>system,</b> now also known as MKS system,and in 1946 the CIPM approved a proposal to adopt the ampere as the electromagnetic unit of the [...] "MKSA system". In 1948 the CGPM commissioned the CIPM [...] "to make recommendations for a single practical system of units of measurement, suitable for adoption by all countries adhering to the Metre Convention". This led to the launch of SI in 1960 and the subsequent publication of the [...] "SI Brochure", which stated that [...] "It is not permissible to use abbreviations for unit symbols or unit names ...".The CGS and MKS systems co-existed during much of the early-to-mid 20th century, but {{as a result of the}} decision to adopt the [...] "Giorgi system" [...] as the international system of units in 1960, the kilogram is now the SI base unit for mass, while the definition of the gram is derived from that of the kilogram.|$|E
