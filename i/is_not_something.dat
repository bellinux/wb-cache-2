25|$|Vaughan has {{admitted}} seeing the series {{as a means}} to explore real-world contemporary politics as well, but states that discussing themes overtly <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> he prefers.|$|E
25|$|This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> {{that would}} benefit all golfers, however, since many average golfers already slice or fade the ball. The draw is more {{appealing}} to amateurs.|$|E
25|$|Li as a Buddhist {{believes}} that the difficulties of everyday life can be overcome {{with the help of}} religious philosophies. He thinks that fame <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> he can control; therefore, he does not care about it.|$|E
5000|$|In an interview, Jones {{explained}} that fame with Led Zeppelin <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> {{that he ever}} became preoccupied with: ...|$|R
25|$|In 2013 British Chief Rabbi Ephraim Mirvis {{stated that}} a {{partnership}} minyan service <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> which {{could take place}} in synagogues under his auspices.|$|R
6000|$|His eyebrows {{were ever}} so {{slightly}} uplifted. She <b>was</b> <b>not</b> absolutely sure that there <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> very suggestive of amusement in his deep-set eyes. She bit her lip. Naturally he <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a gentleman! ...|$|R
25|$|Example (9) is {{grammatical}} yet unacceptable since sleeping <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> {{that can}} pragmatically {{be described as}} being done furiously. Although the syntactic structure is grammatical, the semantic meaning {{does not make sense}} according to the English lexicon.|$|E
25|$|Respect <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> {{based solely}} on {{personal}} or professional qualifications, {{but also on the}} position that God has given that person. In 1 Samuel 26 David spares Saul’s life, even at the risk of losing his own, submitting to the authority God had placed over him as anointed king.|$|E
25|$|Co-redemptrix {{refers to}} an {{indirect}} or unequal but important participation by Mary in the redemption process. She gave free consent to give life to the redeemer, to share his life, to suffer with him under the cross and to sacrifice him {{for the sake of}} the redemption of mankind. Co-redemption <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> new.|$|E
5000|$|Franz {{also was}} a {{commercial}} spokesman for Nextel in the early 2000s. The concept was that Franz [...] "refused" [...] to do the commercials, saying they <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> he did.|$|R
50|$|Broadbent {{was offered}} an OBE in 2002, but he {{declined}} it, stating {{that there were more}} deserving recipients than actors and that the British Empire <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> he wanted to “celebrate”.|$|R
50|$|On the facts, {{the trial}} judge had found that only the mental {{disorder}} automatism defence applied; the triggering effect for Stone <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> that would reasonably be expected from a normal person. Consequently, his defence should fail.|$|R
25|$|The {{depth of}} the study of general Diophantine {{equations}} is shown by the characterisation of Diophantine sets as equivalently described as recursively enumerable. In other words, the general problem of Diophantine analysis is blessed or cursed with universality, and in any case <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> that will be solved except by re-expressing it in other terms.|$|E
25|$|Kiyosaki expands on {{the idea}} of taking risk, advising, that {{financial}} success <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> which can be learned in an academic setting. He emphasizes a different set of skills are needed to be a successful business owner, telling readers entrepreneurship success is learned through multiple failures in business in order to learn best how to succeed.|$|E
25|$|The {{absence of}} an empirically {{identifiable}} meeting point between the non-physical mind and its physical extension has proven problematic to dualism and many modern philosophers of mind maintain that the mind <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> separate from the body. These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, particularly {{in the fields of}} sociobiology, computer science, evolutionary psychology, and the neurosciences.|$|E
5000|$|He relates, [...] "Carrying out {{the duties}} {{attendant}} on that position <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> I enjoyed, but I never sinned by omission. The coward proves himself among swords, the compassionate man, seeks {{to be tested}} by jails and other's pain." ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2014, Norman {{was awarded}} a Bravo award by the New Zealand Skeptics for {{responding}} to Steffan Browning's comments on homeopathy stating, [...] "stating that this <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> the Green Party would support as they take 'an evidence based approach.'" ...|$|R
50|$|An {{environment}} where the purpose <b>was</b> invention <b>not</b> <b>something</b> else like manufacturing.|$|R
25|$|Negative {{effects of}} {{solitude}} may also depend on age. Elementary age school children who experience frequent solitude may react negatively. This is largely because, often, solitude {{at this age}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> chosen by the child. Solitude in elementary-age children may occur when they are unsure of how to interact socially with others so they prefer to be alone, causing shyness or social rejection.|$|E
25|$|Many modern {{philosophers}} of mind adopt {{either a}} reductive or non-reductive physicalist position, maintaining in their different {{ways that the}} mind <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> separate from the body. These approaches have been particularly influential in the sciences, e.g. {{in the fields of}} sociobiology, computer science, evolutionary psychology and the various neurosciences. Other philosophers, however, adopt a non-physicalist position which challenges the notion that the mind is a purely physical construct.|$|E
25|$|Swedenborg {{proposed}} many scientific ideas {{during his}} lifetime. In his youth, {{he wanted to}} present a new idea every day, as {{he wrote to his}} brother-in-law Erik Benzelius in 1718. Around 1730, he had changed his mind, and instead believed that higher knowledge <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> that can be acquired, but that it is based on intuition. After 1745, he instead considered himself receiving scientific knowledge in a spontaneous manner from angels.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, there isn't enough swell {{to make it}} uncomfortable, yet," [...] {{asserted}} Dunham, looking {{about to}} see if there <b>were</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> he could do for her. [...] "And you may turn out a good sailor. Were you ever at sea before?" ...|$|R
50|$|Burkum {{also said}} that the worship nature of most of the songs <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> they planned, but that surged {{eventually}} during the writing/recording process. This is also the first album where Burkum and lead singer Mark Stuart share most of the lead vocals.|$|R
50|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{hospital}} staff were mature and stable people. This selection was made especially {{in view of the}} badly injured patients that could be expected on board. This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> that young people should see. The average age was around forty.|$|R
25|$|Moreover, {{the basis}} is {{associated}} with the primordial or original Buddhahood, also called Samantabhadra, which is said to be beyond time itself and hence Buddhahood <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> to be gained, but an act of recognizing what is already immanent in all sentient beings. Likewise, this view of the basis stems from the Indian Buddha-nature theory. Other terms used to describe the basis include unobstructed (ma 'gags pa), universal (kun khyab) and omnipresent.|$|E
25|$|Pennsylvania {{has passed}} a law which compels an Orthodox Jew to choose between his {{religious}} faith and his economic survival. That is a cruel choice. It is a choice which I think no State can constitutionally demand. For me this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> that can be swept under the rug and forgotten {{in the interest of}} enforced Sunday togetherness. I think the impact of this law upon these appellants grossly violates their constitutional right to the free exercise of their religion.|$|E
25|$|The {{penitent}} is {{the subject}} rather than the object of this discourse. Contrition <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> that happens to the penitent but is rather an affect he or she creates, as the focus on humility and on the weeping voice suggests. Affectivity is the translation of idea into expressive gesture, and this moment is surely an affective one. If the genuineness of a late-medieval spiritual experience is confirmed by its external signs—by its affectivity, in other words—we should extend the same criterion to the early evidence, where we find that it works just as well.|$|E
50|$|In {{the former}} Soviet Union, guyed tubular masts for {{broadcasting}} without these crossbars were also built. However such masts <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> special as such structures also exist in Germany, Czech, Slovakia, France, the United Kingdom, Japan, South Korea, Austria, Sweden, Slovenia and Poland.|$|R
6000|$|... "What, pray, was Atufal's offense, Don Benito?" [...] asked Captain Delano; [...] "if it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> very serious, take a fool's advice, and, {{in view of}} {{his general}} docility, {{as well as in}} some natural respect for his spirit, remit him his penalty." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nay, if {{you think}} so, Doctor," [...] said Joceline--"and, doubtless, I must say, Bevis took an {{interest}} in the man--if indeed it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> worse in the shape of Bevis, for methought his eyes looked wild and fiery, as if he would have spoken." ...|$|R
25|$|Social constructivist {{scholars}} view {{learning as}} an active process where learners should learn to discover principles, concepts and facts for themselves, hence the importance of encouraging guesswork and intuitive thinking in learners (Brown et al.1989; Ackerman 1996). In fact, for the social constructivist, reality <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> that we can discover {{because it does not}} pre-exist prior to our social invention of it. Kukla (2000) argues that reality is constructed by our own activities and that people, together as members of a society, invent the properties of the world.|$|E
25|$|In 1876, Oscar Peschel {{said that}} Native Americans were Mongoloids, and Peschel {{said that the}} Mongoloid {{features}} of Native Americans was evidence that Native Americans populated the Americas from Asia {{by way of the}} Bering Strait. Peschel said that some Native American tribes differ from Mongols in having a high nose bridge rather than a snub nose, but Peschel said that this different type of nose <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> shared by all Native Americans, so it cannot be considered a racial characteristic. Peschel said that Malays and Polynesians were Mongoloids due to their physical traits. Peschel said that the race of the Ainu people was not clear.|$|E
25|$|Yorkshire {{regained the}} County Championship title in 1962. In another {{outstanding}} season of pace and swing, Trueman took 153 first-class wickets at 17.75 with best figures of 8–84. He had one 10 wicket match and five 5 wicket returns. He made 33 first-class appearances in 1962 and scored 840 runs, {{which was the}} best season tally of his whole career but, because of inconsistency, he remained well short of the standard required if {{he was to be}} termed an all-rounder, though that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> he ever pursued given his workload as a specialist bowler. Despite his total of runs, a score of 63 was his only half-century. He held 24 catches.|$|E
2500|$|Both players {{said that}} the trouble <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> they had {{witnessed}} before; and Economidis condemned his supporters, saying that, [...] "It was a really nice atmosphere until this moment. I am really unhappy." [...] Some witnesses have implicated Cypriot and Serbian supporters in the trouble.|$|R
2500|$|In December 2003, Kean {{said that}} the September 11 attacks could have been prevented, stating: [...] "As you read the report, you're {{going to have a}} pretty clear idea what wasn't done and what should have been done. This <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> that had to happen." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1998, {{the then}} National Party leader denied accusations {{that he had}} paid a man for sex, by stating {{that he was a}} Boerseun (farmer's son), {{implying}} that homosexuality <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>something</b> to <b>be</b> found among Afrikaners. South African gay rights organisations called for an apology.|$|R
