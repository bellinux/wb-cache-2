Using beta-peptide-inspired nano-rods, we investigate the effects of both free ions (dissolved salts) and proximally immobilized ions on <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>interactions.</b> We find that the free ion effect is correlated with the water density fluctuation near a non-polar molecular surface, showing that such fluctuation can be an indicator of <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>interactions</b> in the case of solution additives.

40|$|<b>Hydrophobic</b> <b>interactions</b> {{are very}} {{important}} {{in a variety of}} systems such as proteins. Osmoprotectant glycine betaine (GB) stabilizes proteins against denaturation and counteracts harsh conditions such as presence of high concentration of urea. Therefore, it is interesting to specifically investigate the effect of osmolytes on <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>interactions</b> to explore whether the latter plays any role in the counteraction of denaturing property of urea. In this work, molecular dynamics simulations have been performed on neopentane (NEP), a non-polar molecule, in aqueous GB, urea, and'GB-urea mixture to understand the effect of GB on <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>interactions</b> in the presence of urea. The results were analyzed by calculating radial distribution function, potential of mean force, coordination number, and interaction energies. The results indicate that the presence of GB decreases <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>interactions</b> between urea and NEP. We also find that GB and urea molecules strongly interact with each other through H bonding and electrostatic interactions. However, GB and urea have negligible effect on <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>interactions</b> between the NEP molecules.

The study altered temperature as to effect the binding affinity of BSA onto the matrix. It was concluded that cycling temperature from 50 degrees to 10 degrees would not be adequate to effectively wash all BSA from the matrix but could be very effective if the column would only be used a few times.

2500|$|The {{hypothesis}} of protein folding {{was followed by}} research into the physical interactions that stabilize folded protein structures. [...] The crucial role of hydrophobic interactions was hypothesized by Dorothy Wrinch and Irving Langmuir, as a mechanism that might stabilize her cyclol structures. [...] Although supported by J. D. Bernal and others, this (correct) hypothesis was rejected along with the cyclol hypothesis, which was disproven in the 1930s by Linus Pauling (among others). Instead, Pauling championed the idea that protein structure was stabilized mainly by hydrogen bonds, an idea advanced initially by William Astbury (1933). [...] Remarkably, Pauling's incorrect theory about H-bonds resulted in his correct models for the secondary structure elements of proteins, the alpha helix and the beta sheet. [...] The <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>interaction</b> was restored to its correct prominence by a famous article in 1959 by Walter Kauzmann on denaturation, based partly on work by Kaj Linderstrøm-Lang.

2500|$|Combination of {{structural}} elements of ACh and nicotine {{as well as}} reducing the conformational flexibility by using a cyclopropane ring {{has led to the}} discovery of potent and selective α4β2 nAChR ligands. The modulation of three structural elements, the linker, substitution on the amino group and the pyridine ring can be used to determine the influence on potency and selectivity of the ligands. Factors that decrease the binding are steric hindrance on the amino group and linkers that are saturated/unsaturated carbon chains. Short-chained ether linkers are preferred. [...] Beneficial effects on the binding is seen with substitution on the pyridine ring both mono- and disubstitution with halogens among other groups. Substitution on the amino group with three different amides increased the binding affinity where methylamide had the highest binding. Lower binding in the other substituted amides was explained by steric hindrance or lack of a methyl group resulting in loss of <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>interaction.</b> Stereochemistry of pyridine nitrogen and/or the pyridine ring and its stereoelectronic effects has a subtle beneficial effect on the binding to the α4β2 nAChR. Thus it was shown that a pyridyl ether ligand with bromo substitution on the pyridine and metylatedamide on the amino group had the highest potency.|$|E

30|$|It {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} that {{the formation of a}} porphyrin/surfactant complex is facilitated primarily by the electrostatic or <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>interactions</b> between these two components [46 – 49].

Thus, we could simply propose that three kinds of intermolecular interactions, i.e., π-π interactions between porphyrin molecules (H 2 TPyP/H 2 TPyP), <b>hydrophobic</b> <b>interactions</b> between porphyrin and CTAB molecules (H 2 TPyP/CTAB), and CTAB/CTAB interactions, compete with each other during the SASA process.|$|R
