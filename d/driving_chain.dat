The synthesis of closed kinematic structure with piezo- ceramic actuators is investigated for three case studies: А) Synthesis for parallel structures in which the basic links are connected in between, only by means of <b>driving</b> <b>chains</b> of the piezo- ceramic actuators. B) Synthesis for parallel structures in which the basic links are connected in between in a serial <b>chain.</b> The <b>driving</b> <b>chains</b> of the piezo- ceramic actuators are attached parallel to the links of the basic serial chain.

Moreover, the system can realize the capability of active power overload and reactive power support of the power grid since the synchronous generator is directly connected with the power grid at the end of the <b>driving</b> <b>chain.</b> Furthermore, the variable speed constant frequency operation of the system in the whole wind speed range is guaranteed by multimode operating state under different wind speeds so as to capture the maximum wind power. In addition, the damage of the synchronous generator caused by wind speed fluctuation is reduced as the double rotor speed-regulating generator connecting the gearbox and the synchronous generator, so the reliability of the system is improved. Therefore, the double rotor speed-regulating wind {{power generation system}} has a wide application prospect to alleviate the energy crisis and respond to the worsening natural environment.|$|E

The deleterious Z mutation disrupts folding at an early stage, while the relatively benign S mutant shows late stage minor misfolding.

40|$|Abstract. A fault {{diagnosis}} method based on wavelet and adaptive interference canceling is presented for {{the identification of}} a damaged gear tooth. A damaged tooth of a certain gear chain generates impulsive signals that could be informative to fault detections. Many publications are available {{not only for the}} impulsive vibration signal analysis but the application of signal processing techniques to the impulsive signal detections. However, most of the studies about the gear fault detection using the impulsive vibration signals of a <b>driving</b> gear <b>chain</b> are limited to the verification of damage existence on a gear pair. Requirements for more advanced method locating damaged tooth in a <b>driving</b> gear <b>chain</b> should be a motivation of further studies. In this work an adaptive interference canceling combined with wavelet method is used for a successful identification of the damaged tooth location. An application of the wavelet technique provides a superior resolution for the damage detection to the traditional frequency spectrum based methods. An analysis and experiment with three pair gear chain show the feasibility of this study yielding a precise location of the damaged gear tooth...|$|R

50|$|Many <b>driving</b> <b>chains</b> (for example, in factory equipment, {{or driving}} a {{camshaft}} inside an internal combustion engine) operate in clean environments, {{and thus the}} wearing surfaces (that is, the pins and bushings) are safe from precipitation and airborne grit, many even in a sealed environment such as an oil bath.

O-rings were included as a way to improve lubrication to the links of power transmission chains, a service that is vitally important to extending their working life. These rubber fixtures form a barrier that holds factory applied lubricating grease inside of the pin and bushing wear areas. Further, the rubber o-rings prevent dirt and other contaminants from entering the inside of the chain linkages, where such particles would otherwise cause significant wear.|$|R
