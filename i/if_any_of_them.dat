5|$|Lax was {{admitted}} a Fellow of the Royal Society on 5 April 1796. He was nominated by the Astronomer Royal Nevil Maskelyne, Anthony Shepherd, Richard Farmer and William Wales. However, {{due to an}} enmity of the President Joseph Banks, friends of Charles Hutton and Maskelyne, such as Lax, Samuel Vince and Thomas Mudge, frequently saw their submissions for publications overlooked. <b>If</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> submitted papers to the Society: they had the honour of having them carefully lodged in {{the archives of the}} Society, where the world in general, or even the members of the Society, would derive no more benefit from them than if they were deposited at the centre of the earth.|$|E
5|$|Suddenly, {{an image}} of Discord on the stained-glass windows comes to life, teasing the ponies and Celestia. Discord claims to have taken the Elements and alludes to {{where they can be}} located. Twilight {{believes}} Discord is referring to the hedge maze near the castle and the six race there. Discord appears in his true form and challenges the ponies to a game, telling them that the only rules are they are not allowed to fly or use magic (enforcing this rule by making the unicorns' horns and Pegasi's wings vanish), and that <b>if</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> leave the game, he automatically wins. Despite their handicap, the ponies enter the maze, but they are soon separated by Discord's magic. He is able to individually test Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Fluttershy against their respected Elements, making them be momentarily hypnotized, lose some of their color, and become a polar opposite of their Element. Twilight encounters each of them after this point, aware of their personality shift, but oblivious to their encounter with Discord. Soon, they find Rainbow Dash, having regained her wings, flying away from the maze and betraying not only her Element of Loyalty, but also forfeiting the game by leaving; the maze falls around them and Discord boasts his victory, warning of an incoming storm of chaos.|$|E
25|$|Many {{of those}} were Haganah members, and several of them asked {{what was in the}} bags. The Irgun members lied, saying that the bags {{contained}} guns, at which point some of the workers suggested that they should be confiscated. One of the Irgun men, David Dahari, took out his pistol and threatened to fire <b>if</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> touched the bags, so they backed off.|$|E

25|$|The {{possibility}} of studying the mathematics of F1 was originally suggested in 1956 by Jacques Tits, published in , {{on the basis}} of an analogy between symmetries in projective geometry and the combinatorics of simplicial complexes. F1 has been connected to noncommutative geometry and to a possible proof of the Riemann hypothesis. Many theories of F1 have been proposed, {{but it is not clear}} which, <b>if</b> <b>any,</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> give F1 all the desired properties.|$|E
25|$|However, {{there are}} major {{problems}} with this story. First, the Yongzheng Emperor's eldest surviving son, Hongshi, was only seven when Hongli was born, far too young to make the drastic choice of replacing a child of imperial birth with an outsider (and risking disgrace if not death). Second, the Yongzheng Emperor had three other princes who survived to adulthood and {{had the potential to}} ascend the throne. Indeed, since Hongshi was the son forced to commit suicide, it would have been far more logical for him to be the adopted son, <b>if</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were.|$|E
25|$|In April, the Committee were {{informed}} that considerable expenditure was needed to keep these vehicles in service {{and that it was}} not possible to maintain them satisfactorily, whereupon it was decided to ask Seldon Brothers, Wentworth’s, and W. Bamford <b>if</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> would be willing to provide horsebuses for the service, pending construction of the tramway. Bamford agreed to the proposal that he should operate between the top of King Street and the Crown Inn on Carlton Road, via Coalpit Lane (later Cranbrook Street), on a 20-minute frequency at a fixed charge of 9d. per mile; receipts were collected by a Corporation conductor, but the driver was provided by Bamford’s. The last day of motorbus operation was 15 June. After withdrawal, two of the vehicles were converted into tower waggons.|$|E

25|$|During the shooting, many {{of those}} in {{attendance}} managed to escape the room and flee deeper into the building, while those who remained hid underneath tables or in bathrooms, closets, and cupboards. A bullet hit a fire sprinkler pipe, causing water to pour down the banquet room, {{making it difficult to}} see. The perpetrators moved between tables, shooting anyone who moved or made a sound. One person was struck by a bullet that tore through an interior wall, while another was shot while trying to escape through a glass door near where the shooters had entered. Three men attempted to stop one of the shooters, but all were shot; it was unclear <b>if</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> survived. One victim was killed while shielding a coworker with his body. Some initially mistook the attack as an active shooter drill; some previous such drills had taken place in the same banquet room.|$|E
25|$|It is such {{a curious}} position, hollow and rotten to the heart’s core, to have made all over the State large uncomfortable {{communities}} of people whom you call refugees and say you are protecting, but who call themselves prisoners of war, compulsorily detained, and detesting your protection. They are tired of being told by officers that they are refugees under “the kind and beneficient protection of the British”. In most cases there is no pretence that there was treachery, or ammunition concealed, or food given or anything. It was just that an order was given to empty the country. Though the camps are called refugee, there are in reality a very few of these–perhaps only half-a-dozen in some camps. It is easy to tell them, because they are put in the best marquees, and have had time given to them to bring furniture and clothes, and are mostly self-satisfied and vastly superior people. Very few, <b>if</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them,</b> are in want.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the family}} members told {{investigators}} that civilians in Villa Purificación were scared {{to reach out to the}} government for help because they feared reprisals from the Army. They said that they believe the Army summarily executed civilians out of rage for the incidents that occurred on May 1 in Villa Purificación. The families also said that the Army was not letting cattle ranchers give water to their livestock in order to kill them, and asked President Peña Nieto to intervene in the incidents. One {{of the family}} members who supposedly approached the military men guarding the bodies told the press that when he asked a soldier if she could get close to the bodies to see <b>if</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> corresponded to her missing relative, the soldier told her that they were not getting their bodies back and that they would let the corpses rot. The lady claimed that the soldier told her that they killed those people because they were responsible for death of their comrades.|$|E

25|$|Ebrahim Amini {{listed the}} summary of reasons {{presented}} by the two sides. According to him the opposers rejected the proposal because: i) Evidences for Guardianship of the Islamic Jurist were true only for the guardianship of an individual {{and it was not}} clear who held the guardianship when there was a council. Guardianship of a council was not rooted in Hadiths and Islamic jurisprudence. ii) Previous council type organizations such as broadcasting council and supreme judicial council were not successful in practice and leadership council would not do well for similar reasons. iii) People were accustomed to the leadership of an individual and a council of leaders was something unfamiliar for them. iv) An individual leader could act more decisive when dealing with critical and important decisions and solving problems and crisis. On the other hand, the supporters of the proposal believed that: i) At the time, there were no Faqih equal to Khomeini or even two or three levels lower than him so that he could fulfill the expectation of people. ii) In case of council of leaders, the members could compensate each other, <b>if</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> had some shortage in a field.|$|E
500|$|Monteux's first {{high-profile}} conducting experience came in 1895, when he {{was barely}} 20 years old. He {{was a member of}} the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la harpe, to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra <b>if</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of [...] "Oui – Monteux!". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.|$|E
500|$|For the Astral Weeks sessions, {{apparently}} {{they did not}} employ any lead sheets, or at least none were distributed to the musicians.

[...] "We were used to playing to charts, but Van just played us the songs on his guitar and then told us to go ahead and play exactly what we felt." [...] Berliner actually had great appreciation for the freedom given to him and the band; something few, <b>if</b> <b>any,</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were used to.

500|$|Development {{began in}} 2009 at Showtime by then-Showtime {{entertainment}} president Robert Greenblatt and Steven Spielberg, from an idea by Spielberg, {{who had been}} working on the concept for years. The original concept was that each season would follow the production of a new musical, <b>if</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were [...] "stage-worthy", Spielberg would make them into an actual Broadway musical. The series was mainly inspired by The West Wing and Upstairs, Downstairs. Spielberg hired Theresa Rebeck to create the series after watching her play, [...] "The Understudy" [...] and receiving a recommendation from executive producers Craig Zadan and Neil Meron. Before the series could be produced, Greenblatt was named chairman of NBC Entertainment after Comcast took control of newly rechristened NBCUniversal. Greenblatt brought the series with him and NBC ordered production of a pilot in January 2011 for the 2011–12 television season. The pilot reportedly cost $7.5 million to produce. The series was then picked up for the first season on May 11, 2011 for 15 episodes.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Burger King {{announced}} its [...] "competitive hours" [...] requirement that mandated locations extend their {{hours of operation}} to midnight {{for most of its}} American locations. Burger King's reasoning for the changes were necessary to maintain a competitive stand against McDonald's and Wendy's. Burger King stated that roughly 60% of its franchised locations already operated until mid-night, but it sought to have the extended hours of operation cover 100% of locations in order to begin a nationwide advertising campaign promoting late-night sales. On 1 June 2008 the company amended the directive to require restaurants to stay open until 2:00am Thursday-Saturday and open at 6:00am Monday-Saturday. At the time of the announcement, Burger King stated it believed the franchise agreement allowed it set minimum hours and that most of it franchisees had agreed to the extended hours of operation. After the deadline passed, Burger King notified its franchises on 3 July that <b>if</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> failed to implement the new policy by 8 July, the franchises would be in default of their agreement.|$|E
500|$|... "Much {{has been}} written about that scene ... most of it silly," [...] wrote Gene Lees in High Fidelity. The scene was {{inspired}} by two men who took off their clothes to antagonize the police during an informal anti-war gathering. [...] During [...] "Where Do I Go?", the stage was covered in a giant scrim, beneath which those choosing to participate in the scene removed their clothes. [...] At the musical cue, [...] "they [...] naked and motionless, their bodies bathed in Fisher's light projection of floral patterns. [...] They chant of 'beads, flowers, freedom, and happiness.'" [...] It lasted only twenty seconds. Indeed, the scene happened so quickly and was so dimly lit that it prompted Jack Benny, during the interval at a London preview, to quip, [...] "Did you happen to notice <b>if</b> <b>any</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> were Jewish?" [...] Nevertheless, the scene prompted threats of censorship and even violent reactions in some places. It also became fodder for pop-cultural jokes. Groucho Marx quipped, [...] "I was gonna go see it, and then I called up the theater. ... They said the tickets were $11 apiece. I told them I'd call back, went into my bathroom, took off all my clothes, and looked at myself in the full-length mirror. Then I called the theater and said, 'Forget it.'" ...|$|E
