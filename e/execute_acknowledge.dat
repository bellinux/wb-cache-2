As Dorrek ignores her warnings, Veranke declares if he is unable to heed the writings of the Skrull's scriptures and the will of the Skrull people, he should be removed from the throne. For her defiance, Dorrek banishes Veranke to a prison planet, brushing her off as an insane fanatic and a traitor while <b>acknowledging</b> <b>executing</b> her would only turn her into a martyr for her cause.|$|R
5000|$|Once the {{interior}} scaffolding was installed, a thorough evaluative survey of {{the interior}} coatings was <b>executed.</b> The <b>acknowledged</b> presumption of most involved in the restoration was that all coatings would {{be removed from the}} interior metals, that repairs would be made, that metals would be recoated, and the interior would be adequately weatherproofed. The preexisting interior coatings on both the secondary wrought iron framework and the wrought iron central pylon would be removed along with the multiple layers of coal tar and paint that had been applied to the internal copper sheathing. A New York Times article from February 8, 1984, mentioned that the interior copper which was at that time painted [...] "government green" [...] would be cleaned to resemble the salmon color of a new penny. That outermost [...] "government green" [...] layer was a vinyl paint applied in 1975. Because certain sections that had corroded were hidden beneath the layers of coatings, no attempt was made to salvage any of the seven layers of paint, (consisting of a base coat of red lead primer plus six additional coats) and the two layers of bituminous paint (a coal tar coating) that had been used as a water sealant in the statues interior around 1911. The three available coating removal methods tested, developed (or not) and implemented (or not) were: thermal coating removal, abrasive coating removal and chemical coating removal. The methods contemplated for the removal of the coatings on the interior copper differed from that of the other interior metals. For the preparation of the wrought iron parts of the statue, an abrasive removal method also known as dry sandblasting was implemented in order to prevent against flash rusting, The low dusting abrasive material used in the dry sandblasting technique was aluminum oxide.|$|R
40|$|The chromatomembrane-method (CM-method) is an {{extraction}} technique, {{which has}} proved to be reliable as an extraction and preconcentration manifold in flow injection analysis (FIA) The chromatomembrane-method (CM-method) is an extraction technique, which {{has proved to}} be reliable as an extraction and preconcentration manifold in flow injection analysis (FIA). The trick is that two immiscible phases (polar or gas and non polar) can be induced to flow independently through a block of biporous (macro and micro) PTFE. This principle to promote analyte exchange is realized in the chromatomembrane-cell (CM-cell). Consequently, the application of the CM-cell in the environmental analysis resolves all problems of sample pretreatment more simply and more effectively whenever a preconcentration step by gas-liquid-, liquid-gas- or liquid-liquid-extraction is included. Except for the application of the CM-cell to extract and preconcentrate components from one phase into another, the CM-cell was also used for: · fast production of gas mixtures with a constant concentration of one component and · separation of two immiscible phases. In addition the contact area in the biporous PTFE block between the macro- and micropores (64, 2 cm 2 /cm 3) could be determined. Thereby a fast mass exchange is possible. The <b>executed</b> measurements could <b>acknowledge</b> further the suitable application possibilities of the method for the preparation of gaseous samples by absorption in the CM-cell. Beside the gaseous components in air also aerosols could be absorbed with the CM-cell at the same time. In the presented work, the CM-cell has been linked up with: · a conductometric detector after gas-liquid-extraction to detect ozone in gas and · an ionchromatograph (IC) after gas-liquid-extraction to detect sulfur dioxide, nitrous acid, hydrogen chloride and ammonia in gas. The influences of flow rates and preconcentration times were investigated. The mentioned gas components could be quantitatively determined within the nmol/l range. The liquid-liquid-extraction with the CM-cell was successfully executed {{on the basis of the}} determination of phenol in water. An UV/VIS-spectrophotmeter was used for detection. The advantages of the CM-method are the easy possibility of automation, low detection limits and the use of a very small volume of the samples. </HTML...|$|R
