50|$|Charbroilers are not {{generally}} known for consistent cooking surface temperatures, which can vary {{by up to}} 400 F between maximum and minimum. This large temperature differential {{is driven by the}} tendency of the burner array to create a heat plume which draws convective heat {{toward the center of the}} broiler and tends to leave the outer perimeter cooler than the interior. The elevated <b>heat</b> <b>pattern</b> from this plume effect is generally predictable and visible on the grates themselves - temperatures well above 700 F will incinerate the oils left on the grates by normal cooking processes, leaving a discernible white ash that tends to define the hottest areas.|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} is {{aimed to explore}} the distinct molecular signatures in discriminating the rheumatoid arthritis patients with traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) cold pattern and <b>heat</b> <b>pattern.</b> Twenty patients with typical TCM cold pattern and <b>heat</b> <b>pattern</b> were included. Microarray technology was used to reveal gene expression profiles in CD 4 + T cells. The signal intensity of each expressed gene was globally normalized using the R statistics program. The ratio of cold pattern to <b>heat</b> <b>pattern</b> in patients with RA at {{more or less than}} 1 : 2 was taken as the differential gene expression criteria. Protein–protein interaction information for these genes from databases was searched, and the highly connected regions were detected by IPCA algorithm. The significant pathways were extracted from these subnetworks by Biological Network Gene Ontology tool. Twenty-nine genes differentially regulated between cold pattern and <b>heat</b> <b>pattern</b> were found. Among them, 7 genes were expressed significantly more in cold pattern. Biological network of protein–protein interaction information for these significant genes were searched and four highly connected regions were detected by IPCA algorithm to infer significant complexes or pathways in the biological network. Particularly, the cold pattern was related to Toll-like receptor signaling pathway. The following related pathways in <b>heat</b> <b>pattern</b> were included: Calcium signaling pathway; cell adhesion molecules; PPAR signaling pathway; fatty acid metabolism.

In this study, a non-targeted metabonomics approach was carried out to profile metabolic characteristics of RA and its Chinese medicine subtypes by using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Plasma samples of 57 RA patients and 23 healthy controls were collected. On the basis of the traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), RA patients were classified into two main patterns, the cold pattern and the <b>heat</b> <b>pattern.</b> By using univariate and multivariate data analysis, we found that the RA patients presented diverse dysfunctions in inositol phosphate metabolism, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, glucose metabolism, ascorbate metabolism, glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism.

40|$|Background: This study {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} {{the extent to which}} Korean Medicine doctors consider cold and <b>heat</b> <b>pattern</b> identification when prescribing herbal treatment for a disease. Methods: A survey was sent by e-mail to 15, 841 members of the Association of Korean Medicine for whom member information was registered. Of these, 699 (4. 4 %) members participated in the survey. The survey included questions regarding the frequency of use of cold and <b>heat</b> <b>pattern</b> identification in deciding a herbal treatment prescription, the diseases for which cold and <b>heat</b> <b>pattern</b> identification-related herbal treatment was most efficacious, the type of herbal treatment prescribed, and the duration of the treatment. Results: Of the 699 respondents, 591 (84. 5 %) reported that they considered cold and heat when prescribing herbal treatment. The diseases for which consideration of cold and heat patterns was effective were, in order, menopausal disorder (124, 18. 3 %), chronic rhinitis (98, 14. 5 %), dyspepsia (94, 13. 9 %), hwa-byung (92, 13. 6 %), diarrhea (83, 12. 3 %), dysmenorrhea (61, 9. 0 %), headache (59, 8. 7 %), inflammation in the digestive tract (58, 8. 6 %), coldness in hands and feet (58, 8. 6 %), and atopic dermatitis (55, 8. 1 %). The typical treatment duration differed widely for different diseases: atopic dermatitis was most frequently treated for > 2 months (38, 34. 5 %), whereas diarrhea was most frequently treated for ≤ 10 days (73, 43. 6 %). Conclusion: These findings indicate that cold and <b>heat</b> <b>pattern</b> identification is a useful tool employed by Korean Medicine doctors. This study may provide a basis for clinical research investigating the effect of pattern identification-based treatment of diseases...|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of the wet/dry tropical climate on the seasonal <b>heat</b> <b>pattern</b> for two Australian water bodies is examined. The heat content and volume-weighted mean temperature of the reservoirs (Darwin River Reservoir, DRR; Manton River Reservoir, MRR) were computed for an eight year period which included wet seasons of very high and low rainfall. Because of the large volume changes of the two water bodies and dependence of heat content on volume, volume-weighted mean temperature was a better parameter to assess the <b>heat</b> <b>pattern</b> of DRR and MRR. The surface energy budget for DRR, in common with other tropical water bodies, was primarily controlled by net radiation and evaporative energy fluxes. Both reservoirs experienced two annual temperature minima and maxima in most years. The water bodies reached minimum annual temperatures (22 - 25 °C) in the cool, dry season (June-August), then gained heat rapidly during the dry-wet transition (August-October). In December, temperatures reached 31 - 32 °C. During most wet seasons (January, February), monsoon weather caused significant heat loss, leading to a second temperature minimum of 27 - 30 °C. Subsequent heat gain increased temperatures to 30 - 32 °C in March. When monsoon weather was brief, however, neither reservoir experienced significant wet season cooling, resulting in a single annual minimum and maximum temperature. Between April and June reservoir heat loss was most rapid due to reduced shortwave radiation and increased evaporative energy fluxes. The seasonal <b>heat</b> <b>pattern</b> of DRR and MRR is compared to other water bodies exposed to a tropical climate comprising of distinct high and low rainfall seasons. Minimum annual temperatures and heat contents of DRR and MRR coincided with the hemispheric winter, as experienced by nearly all tropical lakes. No single seasonal <b>heat</b> <b>pattern,</b> however, is representative of these tropical climates, due to variable influences of advective and surface heat fluxes, though two annual temperature and heat content maxima and minima is most common...|$|E

Air Water Incorporated Japan (AWI) {{has succeeded}} in developing and commercializing new surface treatment technologies. One {{of them is the}} NV Nitriding process. Through an activation treatment using fluorine-based gas for the surface treatment of metals before the nitriding treatment, it is possible to remove the oxide film, such as the passive film, formed on stainless steels and Ni-based alloys and also to nitride these alloys on a mass-production scale. The activation effect afforded by fluoride enables nitriding at a temperature about 150 ºC lower than other conventional processes, achieving minimal thermal deformation and strain. Also, with this activation process, the range of selection of nitriding conditions such as temperature, gas composition and <b>heat</b> <b>pattern</b> has been considerably extended to enable the formation of a nitride layer optimum for the required characteristics of the treated metals. That is, this process can control the thickness of the nitride compound layer.
