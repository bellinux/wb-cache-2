500|$|Kevin McHale deemed [...] "Wheels" [...] the [...] "most serious" [...] {{episode of}} Glee so far. He enjoyed Artie's {{character}} {{development in the}} episode, explaining {{that when he was}} cast in the role, he did not know Artie's background and thus made up his own backstory for him. He believed that Artie became paralysed later in life, rather than being born that way, which was proven correct in [...] "Wheels". Of the burgeoning romance between Artie and Tina, McHale opined: [...] "I think Tina and Artie will be together. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> be a couple for a long time." [...] He explained that {{from the beginning of the}} show's production, creator Ryan Murphy expressed the belief that Artie and Tina should be together, and so he and Jenna Ushkowitz deliberately sat close to one another during filming, assuming that it would eventually happen. McHale was shocked by Artie's reaction to Tina's faked stutter, and was initially unsure [...] "why he was being so dramatic". He concluded however: [...] "I really think Artie fell for Tina because they were set apart by their disabilities. They're already kind of outcasts being in glee, but within that group they shared a connection. So he based their whole relationship on that and when it went away, Artie didn't know what to do." [...] McHale and Ushkowitz hope that their characters will ultimately become a couple, as they are best friends in real life.|$|E
2500|$|Skinny Puppy {{released}} {{their fourth}} album, VIVIsectVI, in 1988; the albums {{name is a}} pun intended to associate vivisection with Satanism (i.e. the [...] "666 sect"). The group's primary aim with the album was to bring attention {{to the topic of}} vivisection and other issues regarding animal rights. The album's subject matter also deals with subjects such as chemical warfare, environmental waste, and disease. Lead track [...] "Dogshit" [...] was released as a single in 1988 under the name [...] "Censor"; the name change was made by the band when it was decided that the single would not sell well with its original name. The single [...] "Testure", which denounced the testing of animals for research purposes, reached No.19 on Billboards Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart in 1989. According to Ogre, [...] "Testure" [...] was intended to be accessible in the hope of spreading their [...] "anti-vivisectionist" [...] message. [...] "It's the only song <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> be able to play on the radio" [...] said Ogre, continuing [...] "I hope they do play it because it's {{the only way we can}} go beyond our ranks and our loyal fans who already understand the message". [...] "Testure" [...] also featured several well-chosen samples from the film The Plague Dogs, an animated adventure about two dogs who escape from a research laboratory. Melody Maker named VIVIsectVI one of the best albums of 1988, scoring thirteenth place in the magazine's year end list.|$|E

The Upper or new town is laid out on a wild looking place situated on high bluffs which have a steep face to the River & Rocks projecting. The lower, or Old French town, is composed of about 10 or 15 houses, some of them bark roofs. In this part is found Half breed Indians & French and Canadian French. This part stands on a lower ground just above a ravine where Carver’s Cave is. Site of upper town is more broken and it stands on a succession of benches of sand. There is a great many of people here. Many of them have for a covering their wagons and tents. There is two large frame hotels going up and a great many small frame building scattered among the bushes, for the greater part of the ground where the new town stands is not yet grubbed out, full of hazel bushes and scrub oaks. They area asking as high as $500 for lots. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>will</b> {{have a great deal of}} work to do here before they will have things as they should be. There is a slough 100 yards wide between the town and the river, over which they build a causeway to get from the River to the town. Between the river and the slough there is barely room for three or four warehouses. Two are here erecting." ...|$|E
