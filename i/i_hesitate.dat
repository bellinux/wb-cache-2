[...] It took him [...] "four to five years to write my first screenplay writing at night, while I still had another day job." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "Sir/Ma'am, {{not being}} {{informed}} {{to the highest}} degree of accuracy <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> to articulate for fear that I may deviate from the true course of rectitude. In short Sir/Ma'am, I am a very dumb fish, and do not know, Sir/Ma'am!" [...] (given in response to any question to which the above four answers do not apply; this answer is recited as quickly as possible) ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{this time}} Kossowski began to pray, [...] " [...] … because when I was so deep in this {{calamity}} and nearly dead I promised myself that if I {{came out of}} this subhuman land I would tender my thanks to God. <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> to call it a vow, it was rather a promise to myself but later I used to think that it was my obligation …" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>hesitated.</b> Shocking as it {{may seem}} to some people, <b>I</b> <b>hesitated.</b> There was really no need to hurry my decision. I had the whole day before me.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>hesitated.</b> <b>I</b> {{certainly}} {{was not prepared to}} pay anyone for finding Theodore.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>hesitated.</b> It was a {{delicate}} business telling him the idea. And while <b>I</b> was <b>hesitating,</b> Ann jumped in.|$|R
2500|$|The {{number of}} {{transistors}} per chip cannot explain quality-adjusted microprocessor prices fully. Moore's 1995 paper does not limit Moore's law to strict linearity or to transistor count, [...] "The definition of 'Moore's Law' {{has come to}} refer to almost anything related to the semiconductor industry that when plotted on semi-log paper approximates a straight line. <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> to review its origins and by doing so restrict its definition." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the expedition, Fraser wrote a glowing report {{of the quality of the}} soil in the area. The report, which Statham-Drew has described as [...] "euphoric", states: [...] "In giving my opinion of the Land seen on the Banks of Swan River, <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> not in pronouncing it superior to any I ever saw in New South Wales east of the Blue Mountains...." [...] Together with Stirling's effusive report on the naval, strategic and geological qualities of the area, the reports were instrumental in convincing the British Colonial Office to establish the Swan River Colony, and provided impetus to the period of excessively favorable publicity that has been labelled [...] "Swan River mania".|$|E
2500|$|.....under no {{circumstances}} whatever will I be in connexion with Mr Pitt. It {{is sufficient for}} a man's life to have been duped once. <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> no less to say that I will never hold communication with the Duke of Portland until he has made that amende honorable to those...whose weight and consideration in Ireland he has made subservient to his own purposes and views in this country. ...my inclinations, my private attachments, the habits of my life, all combine to make me anxious to see the moment when I {{may be able to}} give the members of opposition honourable assistance. ... But in stating this it certainly is not in my contemplation to become again an active member of an opposition. Those days are over—circumstances have happened that make me think that I can be no more usefully so...but, in one word, should circumstances ever present to me the opportunity of doing essential injury to Mr Pitt's power, or of rendering effectual service to Mr Fox, I will not fail to seize it.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>hesitated.</b> <b>I</b> {{did indeed}} <b>hesitate,</b> poor as <b>I</b> was. But this devil {{of a man}} held his {{banknote}} before me whichever way I looked, and I had only two pounds left in the world! ...|$|R
60|$|The abruptness of the {{proposal}} took me by surprise. <b>I</b> <b>hesitated.</b>|$|R
60|$|Either way, my reply {{might lead}} to serious consequences. <b>I</b> <b>hesitated.</b>|$|R
60|$|There {{are those}} who have blamed the man for that, but until I know my own courage better, <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> to join their number.|$|E
6000|$|... "Exactly," [...] said Gys, {{his voice}} quiet and pleasant. [...] "I don't blame you and I'm not offended. Do you wonder <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> to meet strangers?" ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{made him}} moan, {{it made him}} groan, And almost wore him to a mummy. Why should <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> to own That pain was in his little tummy? ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> {{and then}} {{repeated}} the words. Mr. Ravenor watched me keenly.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> for a moment. Eve {{was looking}} at me for my decision.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>hesitated.</b> Yet {{perhaps the}} Duke {{had a right}} to know the truth.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yours is {{the offer}} of a prince," [...] Tallente replied, after a brief, nervous pause. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>hesitate,</b> you must {{remember}} all that it means for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{made him}} moan--it made him groan [...] And almost wore {{him to a}} mummy: [...] Why should <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> to own [...] That pain was in his little tummy? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the way {{the matter}} {{appeared}} to me," [...] said she; [...] "but the question would arise, if it were all right, why should <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> to tell the sisters?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>hesitated.</b> <b>I</b> {{gathered}} {{this was}} not a Cheeryble Brother; it would be necessary to be moderate in one's demands. [...] "Five-and-twenty shillings a week," [...] I suggested.|$|R
60|$|He {{smiled as}} <b>I</b> <b>hesitated.</b> That man {{read my mind}} like an open book.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>hesitated,</b> while a mist {{of great}} {{darkness}} began to descend on my soul.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> for {{a single}} moment," [...] he replied frankly, [...] "it is because of my work here. However, as you say that Mrs. Weatherley will be there, I will come." ...|$|E
60|$|It is a pleasant, instructive, and {{scholarly}} volume. The three best being, quite out of sight--Crashaw, Otway, and Etherege. They are excellent; <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> between them; but perhaps Crashaw {{is the most}} brilliant.|$|E
6000|$|... "To Calvary," [...] {{he replied}} coldly, as {{he rose to}} leave the room. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> {{to ask you to}} come,--I am afraid you will not find a {{religion}} there that suits you." ...|$|E
60|$|Still <b>I</b> <b>hesitated,</b> {{not liking}} this business; whereon the king {{began to grow}} angry.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> how to answer. To say {{the least}} of it, her request embarrassed me.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>hesitated.</b> It {{seemed to}} me that Grooten was taking a great deal for granted.|$|R
6000|$|It is a pleasant, instructive, and {{scholarly}} volume. The three best being, quite {{out of sight}} - Crashaw, Otway, and Etherege. [...] They are excellent; <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> between them; but perhaps Crashaw is the most brilliant ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{why did you}} {{not tell}} me your object before?" [...] As not a little relieved. [...] "Poor souls--Indians, too--those cruelly-used Indians. Here, here; how could <b>I</b> <b>hesitate.</b> I am so sorry it is no more." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have taken}} the ground from beneath my feet," [...] he declared. [...] "Your opinion of me is such that <b>I</b> <b>hesitate</b> to proceed {{at all in the}} matter which I desired to discuss with you." ...|$|E
60|$|I was {{intensely}} annoyed, if not angry; and <b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> {{a moment}} to calm myself.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>hesitated</b> for a moment. His {{identity}} was only just then beginning to dawn upon me.|$|R
60|$|Still <b>I</b> <b>hesitated,</b> {{but before}} <b>I</b> could speak he {{anticipated}} me {{and returned to}} his fidelity.|$|R
