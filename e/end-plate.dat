25|$|Pancuronium bromide (Trade name: Pavulon): The related drug curare, like pancuronium, is a non-depolarizing {{muscle relaxant}} (a paralytic agent) that blocks {{the action of}} {{acetylcholine}} at the motor <b>end-plate</b> of the neuromuscular junction. Binding of acetylcholine to receptors on the <b>end-plate</b> causes depolarization and contraction of the muscle fiber; non-depolarizing neuromuscular blocking agents like pancuronium stop this binding from taking place.|$|E
25|$|The {{front wing}} was {{moderately}} tapered {{with a straight}} leading edge, while the rear wing was in three parts: an unswept centre section, clearing the propeller and supporting the main undercarriage legs, and outer sections from about ¼ span swept back at approximately 30°, supporting large <b>end-plate</b> fins at the tips. The box-like fuselage connected all the components and carried the engine, fuel and cockpit {{as well as the}} nose undercarriage.|$|E
25|$|At the aft {{end of the}} {{fuselage}} access to the cabin is gained by large clamshell doors and drop down cargo ramp with inbuilt retractable support jacks. Doors in {{the fuselage}} also give access to the cargo hold: two on the starboard side and three on the port side. Above the rear fuselage {{is a very large}} fin and rudder, with a moderately sized tailplane with dihedral fitted with <b>end-plate</b> fins (not fitted for the first flight).|$|E
40|$|According to the {{staining}} intensities for AChE, {{the motor}} <b>end-plates</b> {{of the rat}} diaphragm can be classified into strong (S) and pale (P) types. About 34 % of the total <b>end-plates</b> of the rat diaphragm are of S type and 50 % of P type. The P <b>end-plates</b> differ from S <b>end-plates</b> in two aspects. First, the secondary subneural clefts of the S <b>end-plates</b> are well developed. They are numerous, long, closely packed and often branched. On the other hand, the secondary subneural clefts of the P <b>end-plates</b> are short, sparse and usually unbranched. Secondly, {{there seems to be}} a variation in AChE activity in the P <b>end-plates.</b> Focal negative AChE areas are found in the subneural apparatus of some P <b>end-plates.</b> It is concluded that the less well developed secondary subneural clefts and focal areas of negative AChE activity contribute to the paler staining of the P <b>end-plates.</b> link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{quantitative study}} of the morphological variations of extrafusal motor <b>end-plates</b> of normal cat hindlimb muscles as seen in teased silver impregnated preparations was undertaken. The principal aim {{was to examine the}} hypothesis that <b>end-plates</b> undergo growth and degeneration in a process of cyclic degeneration and renewal ('replacement'). A new classification of the morphological complexity of <b>end-plates</b> was devised and the three muscles studied (peroneus brevis, peroneus digiti quinti and soleus) show characteristic variations in the proportions of complex endings, and in the size relationships of <b>end-plates</b> and muscle fibres. These variations are not related to differences in the proportions of muscle fibres of the three principal histochemical types. The existence of growth and degeneration of <b>end-plates</b> was confirmed, but no new <b>end-plates</b> are formed. Hence the 'replacement' hypothesis is regarded as untenable. Instead, it is suggested that growth leads to the formation of <b>end-plates</b> of greater complexity ('elaboration'), and degeneration to the loss of muscle fibres commonly observed in ageing mammals. The examination of muscles from cats aged 6 - l 8 years supports this concept because there is a striking increase in the proportions of complex <b>end-plates</b> and the number of muscle fibres is reduced. By analogy with the formation of <b>end-plates,</b> it is suggested that 'elaboration' during ageing is a response to the increasing functional demands indicated by the increased body weights and muscle fibre diameters. An attempt to test the effects of use and disuse in kittens was unsuccessful. However, surgically-induced hypertrophy of soleus in a young adult cat resulted in an increased proportion of larger, more complex <b>end-plates</b> with more numerous, longer axon terminals. This strongly suggests that 'elaboration' is indeed a response to functional demand. The observations are discussed in relation to current views of the neuromuscular system...|$|R
25|$|In the newborn, the {{symphysis}} pubis is 9–10mm in width, with thick cartilaginous <b>end-plates.</b> By mid-adolescence the adult size is achieved. During adulthood the <b>end-plates</b> decrease in width to a thinner layer. Degeneration of the {{symphysis pubis}} accompanies aging and postpartum. Women {{have a greater}} thickness of this pubic disc which allows more mobility of the pelvic bones, hence providing a greater diameter of pelvic cavity during childbirth.|$|R
25|$|With {{the advent}} of modern {{electron}} microscopic techniques in the early 1950s, nerve endings were found to contain {{a large number of}} electron-lucent vesicles. The term synaptic vesicle was first introduced by De Robertis and Bennett in 1954. This was shortly after transmitter release at the frog neuromuscular junction was found to induce postsynaptic miniature <b>end-plate</b> potentials that were ascribed to the release of discrete packages of neurotransmitter (quanta) from the presynaptic nerve terminal. It was thus reasonable to hypothesize that the transmitter substance (acetylcholine) was contained in such vesicles, which by a secretory mechanism would release their contents into the synaptic cleft (vesicle hypothesis).|$|E
25|$|After its completion, several {{modifications}} {{were made}} to the first prototype. This machine originally had only the rudder {{at the end of the}} boom, but a horizontal tailplane bearing <b>end-plate</b> fins was later added. A less obvious change was the addition of hydraulically-assisted cyclic pitch control. The second prototype had a modified cabin which allowed for stretcher-borne casualties to be carried. A pair of Ultra-lights were equipped with a slightly larger diameter rotor (32ft/9.75m rather than 28ft/8.6m) for the purpose of improving performance in situations where compactness was not at a premium. It had been recognised that that there was a need for the rotor blades to have a longer lifespan.|$|E
25|$|Having {{started the}} year clearly behind Renault, McLaren {{improved}} in Australia, where Räikkönen finished second after flat spotting a tyre and losing a wing <b>end-plate,</b> which {{caused him to}} fall off the pace somewhat around {{the midpoint of the}} race. Chasing down Alonso during the final stages of the race, he set the fastest lap of the race on the final lap, finishing only 1.8 seconds behind the Spaniard. At the , a bad choice of strategy and a mistake from Räikkönen in qualifying (8th) saw the McLarens get caught in traffic {{in the early part of}} the race allowing Michael Schumacher and Alonso to get away at the front. Räikkönen eventually finished 5th, with team mate Montoya ahead in 3rd place. McLaren team boss Ron Dennis blamed what he deemed to be Räikkönen's poor performance for the team's failure to finish in the top two in the race.|$|E

40|$|We present {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} the flow in a rapidly rotating cylindrical annulus. We show that at the rotation rates relevant to the magneto-rotational instability, the flow is strongly constrained by the Taylor-Proudman theorem. As a result, it is controlled almost entirely by the <b>end-plates.</b> We then consider two possible options for minimizing these end-effects, namely (i) simply taking a very long cylinder, and (ii) splitting the <b>end-plates</b> {{into a series of}} differentially rotating rings. Regarding option (i), we show that the cylinder would have to be hundreds of times {{as long as it is}} wide before end-effects become unimportant in the interior. Since this is clearly not feasible, we turn to option (ii), and show that in order to obtain a smooth angular velocity profile, the <b>end-plates</b> would have to be split into around ten rings. If the <b>end-plates</b> are split into fewer rings, perhaps 3 - 5, the angular velocity profile will not be smooth, but will instead consist of a series of Stewartson layers at the boundaries from one ring to the next. We suggest therefore that the instabilities one obtains in this system will be the familiar Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities of these Stewartson layers, rather than the magneto-rotational instability. At best, one might hope to obtain the MRI superimposed on these Kelvin-Helmholtz modes. Any subsequent interpretation of results is thus likely to be quite complicated...|$|R
2500|$|The {{wings of}} the Hippie are high set with {{noticeable}} positive dihedral. They are unswept, with constant chord and have small <b>end-plate</b> fairings at the tips. [...] They are built from glass and carbon reinforced plastics, with plastic skins and braced to the lower fuselage with a single strut on each side. [...] Glass and carbon reinforced plastics are used throughout the Hippie: the forward fuselage is a glass-fibre ring, mounted under the wing, which incorporates a windscreen, the pilot's seat and a small keel underneath which acts as the main undercarriage. Aft, there is an open, tapering Warren girder which carries the fabric-covered tail unit. [...] The {{leading edge of the}} fin is formed from an extended diagonal fuselage member, with a vertical piece behind to support the rudder. The Hippie has a T-tail with a wire braced tailplane on top of the fin. [...] There is a small loop tailskid {{at the bottom of the}} rudder post.|$|E
60|$|Section 109. A {{little more}} {{attention}} {{must now be}} given to the detailed anatomy of the peripheral and central nerve ends. A nerve, as we have pointed out, terminates centrally in some ganglion cell, either in a ganglion or in the spinal cord or brain; peripherally there is a much greater variety of ending. We may have tactile (touch) ends of various kinds, and the similar olfactory and gustatory end organs; or the nerve may conduct efferent impressions, and terminate in a gland which it excites to secretion, in a muscle <b>end-plate,</b> or in fact, anywhere, where kataboly can be set going and energy disengaged. We may now briefly advert to the receptive nerve ends.|$|E

We visualized acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) and complement component 3 (C 3) in muscle biopsies from 10 Japanese MG patients with MuSK antibodies, compared with 42 with AChR antibodies. The AChR density was not significantly decreased in MuSK antibody (Ab) -positive <b>end-plates</b> compared with AChR antibody-positive <b>end-plates,</b> and C 3 was detected in only two of eight MuSK Ab-positive patients.

40|$|The {{choice of}} a {{suitable}} geometry in de-signing a radio-frequency cavity for e+e- storage ring allows the reduction of multipacting (MP) discharges. We have studied the behaviour of resonant electron discharges in the RF cavity of the Adone storage ring in Frascati, that shows a broad MP barrier in the 35 to 70 kV range of the accelerating voltage. It {{can be explained by}} one point MP on the <b>end-plates</b> of the resonator. Our computer simulations of the trajectories of electrons in the RF fields of the cavity clearly show multipacting trajectories in that region of the cavity at about that field level.

40|$|The {{proportion}} of muscle fibres innervated {{by more than}} one motoneurone (polyneuronal innervation) was measured in the fourth deep lumbrical muscle of young rats following either unilateral deafferentation or spinal cord isolation (cord transection combined with bilateral deafferentation). 2. Unilateral deafferentation at 7 days of age did not affect the subsequent time course of synapse elimination in the developing muscle. 3. Spinal cord isolation at 7 days led to a prolongation of the time course of synapse elimination in the muscle, levels of polyneuronal innervation approaching zero beyond about 30 days (about 20 days in normal animals). The raised levels of polyneuronal innervation in these animals were not associated with significant terminal sprouting at <b>end-plates,</b> but were associated with multiple axonal inputs to <b>end-plates</b> as is found in younger normal animals. This was shown by zinc iodide and osmium staining. Also some muscle fibres had two and sometimes three separate <b>end-plates.</b> 4. Spinal cord isolation in rats 19 or more days old resulted in a reappearance of multiple innervation. This was largely due to ultraterminal sprouting. 5. It is concluded that unilateral deafferentation alone causes no change in the time course of synapse elimination. The multiple innervation caused by total deafferentation and spinal transection is attributed to the lack of activity of these muscles...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} the present study is to obtain the {{performance}} on a larger area (45 cm 2) equivalent to that obtained on a smaller area (4 cm 2) single cell DMFC overcoming performance losses associated with scale-up of single cell DMFCs due to uneven clamping pressure distribution on MEA through the <b>end-plates</b> and non-uniform distribution of reactants to MEA. The current distribution profile along the cathode flow field channel is measured using a segmented current measurement plate to understand the influence of uneven clamping pressure distribution on the MEA. Uniform current distribution in a single cell DMFC with 45 cm 2 electrode area is achieved using angular ribbed <b>end-plates.</b> Also, in the present study performance of conventional DMFC is compared with that of mixed-reactant (MR), i. e. methanol and air. Performance of DMFC operating on mixed reactant (MeOH + air) at anode and air at cathode is superior compared with DMFC operating on aqueous methanol at anode and air at cathode. A power density of 55 mW cm− 2 at 0. 3 V is obtained for a DMFC single cell with an effective area of 45 cm 2 using angular ribbed <b>end-plates</b> and MR at anode and air at cathode under ambient conditions.

40|$|International audienceEfforts {{to model}} {{accretion}} disks {{in the laboratory}} using Taylor–Couette flow apparatus are plagued with problems due to the substantial impact the <b>end-plates</b> have on the flow. We explore the possibility of mitigating the influence of these <b>end-plates</b> by imposing stable stratification in their vicinity. Numerical computations and experiments confirm {{the effectiveness of this}} strategy for restoring the axially-homogeneous quasi-Keplerian solution in the unstratified equatorial part of the flow for sufficiently strong stratification and moderate layer thickness. If the rotation ratio is too large, however, (e. g. Ω o /Ω i = (r i /r o) 3 / 2 where Ω o /Ω i is the angular velocity at the outer/inner boundary and r i /r o is the inner/outer radius) the presence of stratification can make the quasi-Keplerian flow susceptible to the stratorotational instability. Otherwise (e. g. for Ω o /Ω i = (r i /r o) 1 / 2) our control strategy is successful in reinstating a linearly-stable quasi-Keplerian flow away from the <b>end-plates.</b> Experiments probing the nonlinear stability of this flow show only decay of initial finite-amplitude disturbances at a Reynolds number Re = O(10 4). This observation is consistent with most recent computational (Ostilla-Mónico et al. 2014) and experimental results (Edlund & Ji 2014) at high Re, and reinforces the growing consensus that turbulence in cold accretion disks must rely on additional physics beyond that of incompressible hydrodynamics...|$|R
