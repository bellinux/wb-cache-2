25|$|Wool may be spun {{before or}} after washing, {{although}} excessive amounts of lanolin may make spinning difficult, especially when using a drop-spindle. Careless washing may cause <b>felting.</b> When done prior to spinning, this often leads to unusable wool fibre. In washing wool the key thing to avoid is too much agitation and fast temperature changes from hot to cold. Generally, washing is done lock by lock in warm water with dish-soap.|$|E
25|$|Much of {{the early}} European {{exploration}} and trade of Canada {{was based on the}} quest for beaver. The most valuable part of the beaver is its inner fur whose many minute barbs make it excellent for <b>felting,</b> especially for hats. In Canada a 'made beaver' or castor gras that a native had worn or slept on was more valuable than a fresh skin since this tended to wear off the outer guard hairs.|$|E

500|$|Humanity {{has long}} used animal skins for clothing, as the leather is durable and the fur {{provides}} extra insulation. The native people of North America made much use of beaver pelts, tanning and sewing them {{together to make}} robes. Europeans appreciated the quality of these and the North American fur trade developed and became of prime importance to early settlers. In Europe, the soft underfur known as [...] "beaver wool" [...] {{was found to be}} ideal for <b>felting</b> and was made into beaver hats and trimming for clothing. Later, the coypu took over as a cheaper source of fur for <b>felting</b> and was farmed extensively in America and Europe; however, fashions changed, new materials became available and this area of the animal fur industry declined. The chinchilla has a soft and silky coat and the demand for its fur was so high that it was nearly wiped out in the wild before farming took over as the main source of pelts. The quills and guardhairs of porcupines are used for traditional decorative clothing. For example, their guardhairs are used {{in the creation of the}} Native American [...] "porky roach" [...] headdress. The main quills may be dyed, and then applied in combination with thread to embellish leather accessories such as knife sheaths and leather bags. Lakota women would harvest the quills for quillwork by throwing a blanket over a porcupine and retrieving the quills it left stuck in the blanket.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fishermen}} traded metal {{items for}} beaver robes made of sewn-together, native-tanned, beaver pelts. They used the robes {{to keep warm}} on the long, cold return voyages across the Atlantic. These castor gras in French (or [...] "beaver coat" [...] in English) became prized by European hat makers {{in the second half}} of the 16th century, as they converted the pelts to fur felt. The discovery of the superior <b>felting</b> qualities of beaver fur, along with the rapidly increasing popularity of beaver felt hats in fashion, transformed the incidental trading of fishermen in the sixteenth century into a growing trade in the French and later English territories in the next century.|$|E
2500|$|A yarn's {{usefulness}} {{is judged}} by several factors, {{such as its}} loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and <b>felting</b> qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and its appearance, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features.

50|$|Presses can be {{single or}} double <b>felted.</b> A single <b>felted</b> press has a <b>felt</b> {{on one side}} and a smooth roll on the other. A double <b>felted</b> press has both sides of the sheet in contact with a press <b>felt.</b> Single <b>felted</b> nips are useful when mated against a smooth roll (usually in the top position), which adds a two-sidednessâ€”making the top side appear {{smoother}} than the bottom. Double <b>felted</b> nips impart roughness on both sides of the sheet. Double <b>felted</b> presses are desirable for the first press section of heavy paperboard.|$|R

2500|$|Throughout the 19th {{century and}} {{well into the}} 20th century, {{a wide range of}} hats was {{manufactured}} to suit all tastes and purses. The names used by the competing manufacturers to describe their products was bewildering and some of these were; felt hats, silk hats, fur hats, wear fur hats, soft hats, stiff hats, velour hats, wool hats, straw hats and, of course, the ubiquitous cloth cap. In the 1930s the 'Attaboy' trilby hat was introduced by the Denton Hat Company. This brand quickly became famous and it was in production for many years. Ladies' hats were not forgotten either and at least one works specialised in making these and the hat master's wife designed them at home. Hats were made for home consumption and for export. The well-known slogan [...] "If you want to get ahead, get a hat" [...] arose in Denton and, needless to say, anyone attending for a job interview not wearing a hat was quickly shown the door. Similarly, until the early 20th century, anyone entering a Denton shop without a hat would receive much cursing. The term, [...] "mad as a hatter" [...] also arose in Denton because the mercury used in the <b>felting</b> process led to mercury poisoning.|$|E
2500|$|A yarn's {{usefulness}} for a knitting {{project is}} judged by several factors, {{such as its}} loft (its ability to trap air), its resilience (elasticity under tension), its washability and colorfastness, its hand (its feel, particularly softness vs. scratchiness), its durability against abrasion, its resistance to pilling, its hairiness (fuzziness), its tendency to twist or untwist, its overall weight and drape, its blocking and <b>felting</b> qualities, its comfort (breathability, moisture absorption, wicking properties) and of course its look, which includes its color, sheen, smoothness and ornamental features. [...] Other factors include allergenicity; speed of drying; resistance to chemicals, moths, and mildew; melting point and flammability; retention of static electricity; and the propensity to become stained and to accept dyes. [...] Different factors may be more significant than others for different knitting projects, {{so there is no}} one [...] "best" [...] yarn. [...] The resilience and propensity to (un)twist are general properties that affect the ease of hand-knitting. [...] More resilient yarns are more forgiving of irregularities in tension; highly twisted yarns are sometimes difficult to knit, whereas untwisting yarns can lead to split stitches, in which not all the yarn is knitted into a stitch. [...] A key factor in knitting is stitch definition, [...] corresponding to how well complicated stitch patterns can be seen when made from a given yarn. [...] Smooth, highly spun yarns are best for showing off stitch patterns; at the other extreme, very fuzzy yarns or eyelash yarns have poor stitch definition, and any complicated stitch pattern would be invisible.|$|E
60|$|A {{spot was}} soon chosen {{between the house}} and the stream on the right. The {{distance}} was soon measured and marked; and while Hans carried down the heavy posts one by one on his shoulder, the others went to work. The soil was soft and rich, and the holes were dug to the required depth in a shorter time than would have been considered possible. The wire was stretched and fastened, and before sunset everything was in readiness. The animals were driven in, and the entrance, which was narrow, was blocked up with brushwood from the river. Then followed another half-hour's work in getting up a small shelter with the cases and some of the <b>felting,</b> for Mr. Hardy and his sons. By this time all were really tired, and were glad when Hans summoned them to another meal, this time of one of the sheep. Then Mr. Hardy and the boys, taking their mugs of tea, retired into the shelter prepared for them, and sat and talked over the events of the day, and as to the work for to-morrow; and then, wrapping themselves up in their blankets, laid down to sleep, listening for some time dreamily to the hum of conversation of the men, who were sitting smoking round the fire, and to the hoarse roar of the innumerable frogs in the stream below.|$|E
