5000|$|Social {{lending and}} social investors {{increased}} in popularity and {{number in the}} 1990s, in part {{as a reaction to}} the trend within charities, social enterprises and other voluntary and community organisations towards increasing their percentage of earned income and away from depending on shrinking sources of grant income. As a non-profit organisation develops new income streams, there is typically a funding gap between necessary <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>capacity,</b> staff or infrastructure and profitability. This trend coincided with an increased tendency, in both the US and the UK, of government to turn to the voluntary and community sector to offer public services and provide solutions to social problems. Finally, the proliferation of venture capital firms in the tech boom of the mid-nineties highlighted the successful practices of venture capitalists and other private investors, and those practices eventually spilled over to the non-profit world. This trend began in the US, most notably on the west coast, and eventually spread to the UK and Europe.|$|E

In that study, in-depth interviews with open-ended questions were conducted with experts on citizen participation in environmental issues and community capacity building. The purpose of the interviews was to identify: 1) areas {{most in need of}} an <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>capacity</b> building; 2) capacity building tools and techniques that are perceived to be effective by communities and citizens; 3) effective mechanisms for delivering capacity building tools; and 4) approaches that could be taken to implement capacity building efforts.

Another phase of this needs assessment, occurring concurrently with the others and informing the construction and analysis of the various approaches examined, was a literature review on public participation relevant to capacity building.|$|E
5000|$|Most {{contemporary}} analysts regard illiteracy as {{a development}} issue {{because of the}} link between poverty and illiteracy. Funding is inadequate and inconsistent and is needed for priority areas such as educator training, monitoring, and evaluation. There is a clear need for <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>capacity</b> development, having a full, sufficiently paid and well qualified professionalized staff, and increasing the demands for adult education professionals. The majority of adult educators are untrained, especially in basic literacy. Governments often employ schoolteachers and others in adult education posts rather than experienced adult educators. [...] Many of the difficulties experienced could be solved by allocation of resources to meet the needs (adequate funds, more staff, appropriate training for staff and suitable material). Underfunding is a huge threat to the sustainability of these programs, and in some cases, to their continued existence. The best-reported data on funding is about adult literacy and non-formal education programs. Funding for continuing education, either academic or vocational is provided and reported on, but little data is given on its financing. Funding may come from public or private sector sources. International and foreign aid is also likely to be important. The costs of much adult education seem to be kept artificially low by the use of state facilities and by the extremely low salaries paid to many adult education specialists.|$|E

[...] Another bill was drafted in the United States Senate in 2008 and in 2010, a bill was being scripted in the House. Between 2009 and 2010, the Institute of Medicine released two reports, of which one focused on the importance of health to international development and diplomacy, and the other on the critical need for health-based human resources to strengthen the HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria efforts. Furthermore, in September 2010, physicians Paul Farmer, Sara Auld, and Vanessa Kerry’s Perspectives piece in the New England Journal of Medicine reinvigorated the argument for a program comparable to GHSP. [...] It noted the importance of health to development and of the possibility of sending U.S. doctors, nurses, and other health professionals abroad in a partnership program to provide education, <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>capacity</b> of local health professionals, and support for health system strengthening. It outlined a vision of loan repayment to ensure that financial obligations were not a barrier to service. The piece gained attention and GHSP planning efforts resumed. Vanessa Kerry and Sara Auld started a grassroots campaign online, created a petition, and began to connect to many of its original champions. Among them were Fitzhugh Mullan, Michele Barry, Senior Associate Dean for Global Health and Director of Global Health Programs in Medicine at Stanford University School of Medicine, and Ed O'Neil Jr., founder and president of OmniMed, and to those already engaged in similar work such as Baylor College of Medicine and its Pediatric AIDS Corps. In an op-ed in The Huffington Post, Anand Reddi proposed integrating the GHSC within the President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.|$|E

40|$|A more {{competitive}} and export-oriented manufacturing sector {{is an important}} objective of the Australian Labor Government's economic strategy. In furthering this objective levels of tariff protection have been lowered and foreign exchange markets deregulated. The strategy has been boosted by the competitive gain afforded by depreciation of the Australian dollar in 1985 and 1986. This article offers estimates {{of the size of}} Australian manufacturing <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> export-creating <b>capacity</b> over the period 1980 - 81 to 1987 - 88. A breakdown of these estimates by individual industries is also provided. Our estimates indicate an improving trend since depreciation of the Australian dollar. However, this improvement has been from a low base. Moreover, the levels of <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> export-creating <b>capacity</b> have yet to attain the levels prevailing in the early 1980 s, and there are worrying signs that the improving trend stalled {{toward the end of the}} period.

40|$|This paper {{seeks to}} {{understand}} {{the impact of the}} Medicare Rural Hospital Flexibility (Flex) Program. The goal of this program is to maintain access to hospital care for rural residents. Like many other government policies, the Flex program targets the underlying supply infrastructure, in this case by providing more generous cost-plus reimbursement to rural hospitals in exchange for capacity and service limitations. The program created a new class of hospital, the Critical Access Hospital (CAH), to which rural hospitals can convert. We specify a dynamic oligopoly model of the rural hospital industry with hospital <b>investment</b> <b>in</b> <b>capacity,</b> exit and conversion to CAH status. We develop new methods that allow us to efficiently estimate the structural parameters and compute counterfactual equilibria. We use the methods to estimate the impact of eliminating and modifying the Flex program on access to hospitals and patient welfare. We find that without the Flex program 5 % of currently operating hospitals would have closed. Although the minimum distance to a hospital is reduced by the program, the actual average distance traveled to receive care increased.

40|$|We model <b>investments</b> <b>in</b> <b>capacity</b> <b>in</b> a {{homogeneous}} product duopoly facing uncertain demand growth. Capacity building is achieved through adding production units that are durable and lumpy and whose cost is irreversible. There is no exogenous order of moves, no first-mover or second-mover advantage, no commitment, and no finite horizon; while building their capacity over time, firms compete `a la Cournot {{in the product}} market. We investigate Markov Perfect Equilibrium (MPE) paths of the investment game, which may include preemption episodes and tacit collusion episodes. However, when firms have not yet invested <b>in</b> <b>capacity,</b> the sole pattern that is MPEcompatible is a preemption episode with firms investing at different times, but both have equal value. The first such investment may occur earlier, and therefore be riskier, than socially optimal. When both firms hold capacity, tacit collusion episodes may be MPE-compatible with firms investing simultaneously at a postponed time (generating an <b>investment</b> wave <b>in</b> the industry). We show that the emergence of such episodes is favored by higher demand volatility, faster market growth, and lower discount rate (cost of capital) ...|$|R
