It is utilized {{in the production}} of printed electronics, Radio Frequency (RF) devices and flexible displays [1 - 2]. A new application includes bump fabrication to electrically connect chip and substrate on semiconductor packages. In practice, wire bonding technology has been mainly used for these electrical connections, which can be bonded at a low price. At higher frequencies, however, the wire bonding technique reaches the limit for RF applications, because the bonding wire generates a parasitic inductance that degrades the transmission characteristics.

To ensure that the diffusion barrier layer, mostly of nickel, adheres well to the bump core, a pretreatment was previously required either using a cleaning solution or involving placement in a nucleation bath.

The FC mounting technology on green tape ceramic substrates offers economical and flexible solutions for a wide industrial application of multi chip modules including consumer products and industrial applications like automotive, telecommunication and medical electronic systems. The application of FC-technology on greentape multilayer substrates requires adapted metallization systems on substrate and chip. Fluxless soldering is possible directly on different thick film pattern metallizations. Concerning the process optimization and reliability investigations the Flip-Chip bonding experiments were performed using special test chips and test substrates. In order to study the thermomechanical behavior of the joints FEM-simulations were performed. In the project two bumping processes based on electroplated Au/Sn and Pb/Sn solders were developed. The bonding process was performed with the flip-chip bonder FC- 950 from Carl Suess. For a fluxless soldering process, special aspects of reference were formulated. The fluxless <b>flip</b> <b>chip</b> <b>bonding</b> experiments were performed on different thick film metallization using substrates with an excellent flatness. The best mechanical and electrical results are achieved with Au/Sn solder bumps mounted on Pd/Ag metallizations. The influence of the contact height and the chip size on reliability were investigated by thermal cycling. The reliability of the joints could be significantly increased if an adequate underfill material was applied.

40|$|<b>Flip</b> <b>chip</b> or wire <b>bonding</b> on highly {{sensitive}} low-k and ultra-low-k (ULK) BEoL-structures {{is an important}} issue concerning the thermo-mechanical integrity. To assess the thermo-mechanical stress situation in BEoL structures under the loading conditions of wire bonding and pull testing using Finite-element-analyses (FEA), a suitable approach is necessary. In particular, the phenomenon of friction at the bonding surfaces, the heat sources of friction and shock and vibrations have to be considered. These simulations together with experimental findings deliver essential insights into the stress situation within low-k and ULK BEoL structures during bonding and pull tests and, as it is a well described physical model, give basic measurable knowledge on the major factors influencing the thermo-mechanical reliability. Copper instead of Gold wire bonding is introducing much higher mechanical impact to underlying Back-end of line (BeoL) structures and actives like low-k and ultra low-k materials for (BEoL) layers of advanced CMOS technologies because of the higher stiffness and lower ductility of Copper compared to Gold. Increasing stiffness is also an issue for Copper studs replacing solder ball interconnects in the case of <b>flip</b> <b>chip</b> mounting whereby BEoL loading is increasing...|$|R
