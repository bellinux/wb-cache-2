25|$|Viewed {{against the}} {{backdrop}} of SCO's plethora of public statements concerning IBM's and others' infringement of SCO's purported copyrights to the UNIX software, it is astonishing that SCO has not offered any competent evidence to create a <b>disputed</b> <b>fact</b> regarding whether IBM has infringed SCO's alleged copyrights through IBM's Linux activities.|$|R
50|$|This {{period is}} to clarify <b>disputed</b> <b>facts</b> and legal issues. The parties {{exchange}} briefs and supporting documents through answers and counterclaims under the court supervision. The defendant {{is required to}} file a written answer within 30 days after the complaint is served. In response, the defendant can accept, dispute, or remain silent about the allegations.|$|R
50|$|The summary {{judgment}} for tortious contract interference was vacated and remanded {{to the district}} court for further consideration because the requirements for {{summary judgment}} - that {{as a matter of}} law, judgment could only possibly be found in favor of one party even when all <b>disputed</b> <b>facts</b> are considered in a light most favorable to the other party - were not met.|$|R
60|$|Miracles {{cannot be}} {{received}} as testimonies of a <b>disputed</b> <b>fact,</b> because all human testimony {{has ever been}} insufficient to establish the possibility of miracles. That which is incapable of proof itself is no proof of anything else. Prophecy has also been rejected by the test of reason. Those, then, who have been actually inspired are the only true believers in the Christian religion.|$|R

5000|$|Lehrman {{stepped down}} as Rite Aid {{president}} in 1977 and {{as chairman of the}} firm's executive committee in 1981, eventually severing all ties with the company. His role in what Lehrman called [...] "helping to build Rite Aid" [...] became a political issue in Lehrman's 1982 New York State gubernatorial campaign when Grass, who was then the company's chairman and CEO, took issue with published articles that gave credit to Lehrman for the company’s growth. New York Magazine's Michael Kramer interviewed Grass for a profile on Lehrman. Lehrman [...] "wasn't the founder. I was," [...] said Grass. After quoting Grass's version of the founding of Rite Aid, Kramer wrote: [...] "Grass of course, is denigrating Lehrman, and as for the facts, they aren't facts at all, or at least they are <b>disputed</b> <b>facts.</b> They are <b>disputed</b> by a host of former and present Rite Aid officers and directors with whom I spoke." [...] Kramer went on to quote other Rite Aid officers and directors. Lehrman [...] "took a sleepy little company and breathed life into it," [...] said one company director. Maxwell Rabb, a Rite Aid director and former ambassador to Italy, declared: [...] "Lew's role was at least the equal of anyone else's." ...|$|R
5000|$|Gluckman {{has argued}} that Bohannan’s {{excessive}} use of native terminology creates barriers when attempting to achieve comparative analysis. He in turn has suggested {{that in order to}} further the cross-cultural comparative study of law, we should use English terms and concepts of law which will aid in the refinement of <b>dispute</b> <b>facts</b> and interrelations [...] Thus, all native terms should be described and translated into an Anglo-American conceptual equivalent for the purpose of comparison.|$|R
25|$|She {{may have}} never fully {{recovered}} from {{the death of her}} son and retired from public life, except on important occasions. The major source that Octavia never recovered is Seneca ("Cons ad Marcia", II.) but Seneca may wish to show off his rhetorical skill with hyperbole, rather than adhere to <b>fact.</b> Some <b>facts</b> <b>dispute</b> Seneca's version, for Octavia publicly opened the Library of Marcellus, dedicated in his memory, while her brother completed the Marcellus's theatre in his honor. Undoubtedly Octavia attended both ceremonies, as well as the Ara Pacis ceremony to welcome her brother's return in 13 from the provinces. She was also consulted in regard to, and in some versions advised, that Julia marry Agrippa after her mourning for Marcellus ended. Agrippa had to divorce Octavia's daughter Claudia Marcella (Major) in order to marry Julia, so Augustus wanted Octavia's endorsement very much.|$|R
50|$|After {{the judge}} has {{reviewed}} the initial petition and the answer, the judge and parties meet to reduce {{the focus of the}} litigation to the issues in contention. If the review produces the realization that there are no <b>disputed</b> <b>facts</b> and that the issue of contention is a matter of law, he may offer summary judgment before the trial. If not, the conclusive opening order verifies that the issue of contention is deserving of an answer based upon the merits of the case, and defines what issues will be brought before the court.|$|R
50|$|If {{the accused}} is found guilty {{the trial judge}} must {{determine}} a fit sentence. See Criminal sentencing in Canada. Where the trial is by judge alone, the judge will determine all facts which were proven and allow the parties to adduce additional evidence concerning <b>disputed</b> <b>facts</b> which may {{form the basis for}} finding aggraviting or mitigating circumstance (i.e. the extent of injuries sustained by a victim). The Crown must prove an aggravating fact beyond a reasonable doubt while the accused bears a burden on a balance of probabilities to prove a mitigating fact.|$|R
40|$|It has {{recently}} been argued that the following Rule {{should be part of}} any characterization of science: Claims concerning specific <b>disputed</b> <b>facts</b> should be endorsed only if they are sufficiently supported by the application of validated methods of research or discovery, and moreover that acceptance of this Rule should lead one to reject religious belief. This paper argues, first, that the Rule, as stated, should not be accepted as it suffers from a number of problems. And second, that even if the Rule were to be acceptable, it should not lead one to reject religious belief...|$|R
40|$|It is {{a little}} <b>disputed</b> <b>fact</b> that each year birds cause damage through crop depredation, {{roosting}} activities, and bird/aircraft strike damage with occasionally associated loss of life. Stephen (1961) cites an article by Elkins (1957) which said ducks cause {{millions of dollars of}} loss to barley, oats, and wheat crops in Canadian prairies. Damage to ripening cereal grain crops in the western United States {{is one of the most}} widespread bird problems (DeGrazio 1964). Zajanc (1962) reports these losses are estimated at $ 15 million annually in three western states alone where blackbirds feed in fields of rice, corn, small grains, truck crops, nuts, and fruits located near roosting areas...|$|R
50|$|Certain <b>disputes</b> of <b>fact</b> {{had arisen}} {{between the parties}} which were such as would {{give rise to a}} variety of wide-ranging factual {{enquiries}} involving real and substantial questions of <b>fact.</b> Although such <b>disputes</b> had been clearly foreseeable, the court determined that it would in the circumstances serve no purpose to dismiss the application. The procedure envisaged in Rule 6(5)(g), of referring such <b>disputes</b> of <b>fact</b> for the hearing of oral evidence, was not intended, the court found, for the purpose of resolving disputes of the kind that had arisen in the present case. Accordingly, it would be more appropriate to order the parties to trial.|$|R

2500|$|Despite this, O'Connor {{agreed with}} Churchill and the Seventh Circuit that Mihm had erred in {{granting}} summary judgement against the nurse. [...] " [...] has produced {{enough evidence to}} create a material issue of <b>disputed</b> <b>fact</b> about petitioners' actual motivation." [...] It was possible that a trier of fact could find, in certain other actions by the hospital management, evidence that her non-disruptive, and therefore protected, criticisms of {{the implementation of the}} cross-training policy. That conclusion foreclosed the need to decide the qualified immunity question that had been discussed so heavily at oral argument. The Seventh Circuit's decision was vacated and the case remanded to district court to decide what action of Churchill's had motivated the firing.|$|R
50|$|The {{death toll}} wasn't the only <b>fact</b> <b>disputed</b> and it wasn't the most contentious. One second hand {{account in the}} local paper claimed an Indian man emerged from his house with a white flag, only to be murdered {{alongside}} his son, while another explained how the militia were the ones waving a white flag, {{but that it was}} done in order to trick the Chehaw into a false sense of security.|$|R
5000|$|The {{court found}} that a {{qualification}} was necessary to the general rule regarding final interdicts in motion proceedings. Sometimes the denial by the respondent of a fact alleged by the applicant may not be such as to raise a real, genuine or bona fide <b>dispute</b> of <b>fact.</b> If the respondent {{in such a case}} has failed to apply for the deponents concerned to be called for cross-examination, and if the court is satisfied as to the inherent credibility of the applicant's averments, the court may decide the <b>disputed</b> <b>fact</b> in the applicant's favour, without hearing oral evidence. This {{has come to be known}} as the [...] "Plascon-Evans rule." [...] When factual disputes arise, therefore, relief should be granted only if the facts stated by the respondent, together with the admitted facts in the applicant's affidavits, justify the order. The court noted there may be exceptions to this general rule, as where the allegations or denials are so far-fetched that the court is justified in rejecting them on the papers.|$|R
50|$|Ramsbottom J and Blackwell J concurred in the {{judgment}} of Murray AJP, who reiterated that, except in interlocutory matters, it is undesirable to attempt to settle <b>disputes</b> of <b>fact</b> solely on the probabilities disclosed in contradictory affidavits. Where no real <b>dispute</b> of <b>fact</b> exists, {{there is no reason}} for incurring the delay and expense involved in a trial action: Motion proceedings in such a case are generally recognised as permissible.|$|R
50|$|The party {{raising a}} <b>dispute</b> of <b>fact</b> in motion proceedings, the court found, must seriously and {{unambiguously}} address that fact. This will {{indicate that the}} dispute is real, genuine or bona fide. If the disputing party necessarily possesses the knowledge and ability to show the facts in question to be untrue or inaccurate, but nonetheless fails to do so, instead resting on a bare or ambiguous denial, there is no bona fide <b>dispute</b> of <b>fact.</b>|$|R
50|$|Where a <b>dispute</b> of <b>fact</b> {{is shown}} to exist, however, the court has a {{discretion}} as to the future course of the proceedings. If the <b>dispute</b> of <b>fact</b> cannot properly be determined by viva voce evidence under Rule 9, the parties may be sent to trial in the ordinary way (either on the affidavits as constituting the pleadings, or else with a direction that pleadings be filed); otherwise the application may be dismissed with costs.|$|R

2500|$|Some tax {{protesters and}} others opposed to income taxes cite what they contend is {{evidence}} that the Sixteenth Amendment was never properly ratified, based in large part on materials sold by William J. Benson. In December 2007, Benson's [...] "Defense Reliance Package" [...] containing his non-ratification argument which he offered for sale on the Internet, was ruled by a federal court to be a [...] "fraud perpetrated by Benson" [...] that had [...] "caused needless confusion and a waste of the customers' and the IRS' time and resources".

40|$|In {{order to}} perform certain actions – such as incarcerating {{a person or}} revoking parental rights – the state must {{establish}} certain facts to a particular standard of proof. These standards – such as preponderance of evidence and beyond reasonable doubt – are often interpreted as likelihoods or epistemic confidences. Many theorists construe them numerically; beyond reasonable doubt, for example, is often construed as 90 to 95 % confidence in the guilt of the defendant. A family of influential cases suggests standards of proof should not be interpreted numerically. These ‘proof paradoxes’ illustrate that purely statistical evidence can warrant high credence in a <b>disputed</b> <b>fact</b> without satisfying the relevant legal standard. In this essay I evaluate three influential attempts to explain why merely statistical evidence cannot satisfy legal standards...|$|R

40|$|There is a {{substantial}} gap between the recent literature analyzing predation—especially the economic literature—and the attempts of courts to identify and redress such conduct. This is hardly surprising. A consensus has yet to emerge within the legal or economic communities as to what, in theory, should constitute predation. Moreover, courts must temper theoretical economic concerns with evidentiary, procedural, and jurisprudential considerations. Indeed, one may reasonably ask how well even an accepted economic definition of predation could be applied in the courtroom environment of incomplete <b>facts,</b> <b>disputed</b> interpretations, unsettled theory, and limited economic expertise...|$|R
