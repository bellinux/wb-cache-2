5|$|Corentin and Madame du Gua, foils to the <b>happy</b> <b>couple,</b> {{plot and}} scheme {{endlessly}} {{to bring about}} the misery and downfall of those who will not love them. Du Gua is at first a sympathetic character, {{but by the end of}} the novel she is presented as sharing a face with a spirit from hell. She represents revenge and hatred chiseled from romantic injury, and has been noted as a rough sketch of the title character in Balzac's La Cousine Bette. Corentin, meanwhile, stands in contrast to Montauran's romantic nature as much as to Hulot's military prowess. Rebuffed by Marie and unable to wield the might of the commandant, Corentin relies on trickery and deception to achieve his ruthless ends.|$|E
5|$|Before season 20, {{little was}} shown {{concerning}} Cartman's romantic interests, {{as for the}} most part, his attitude towards females had been sexist. However, at least in one episode ("Chef Goes Nanners"), Cartman develops an attraction to Wendy, which is apparent {{from the end of}} episode when Wendy describes her temporary infatuation towards Cartman as 'sexual tension' and even though Cartman agrees in front of Wendy, he sighs with sorrow at being alone again. During a period when he was physically unable to control his speech and he repeatedly blurted hidden feelings, he expressed a romantic interest in classmate Patty Nelson, a side character who has not been seen before or since. In Season 20, after Cartman is wrongfully accused of being a persistent and highly aggressive internet troll (actually Gerald Broflovski) leaving foul posts primarily targeting women and girls on South Park Elementary's school message boards, the other boys destroy most of Cartman's electronics, and by extension, his social media presence, causing him to become despondent to everything around him. That is until Heidi Turner, who had quit social media in response to the trolling, offers to show him life outside of social media. The two quickly become friends, and later, an official and shockingly very <b>happy</b> <b>couple.</b>|$|E
5|$|LeChuck's advances, he {{nevertheless}} pursues {{her love}} and aims to impress her by discovering {{the secret of}} Monkey Island. The exhibition ultimately costs LeChuck his life, but he returns as a ghost still intent on marrying Elaine. LeChuck's ambitions for Elaine's hand in marriage—whether given willingly or not—form {{a major part of}} the franchise's plot. Elaine first encounters Guybrush when he breaks into the governor's mansion on Mêlée Island in an attempt to steal a valuable idol. Elaine has been fascinated to meet Guybrush since hearing of his arrival on the island and his strange name, however, their first meeting is stunted by Guybrush being too awestruck by Elaine's beauty to say anything intelligible. When the local sheriff tries to drown Guybrush after a fight, Elaine nevertheless rushes to his aid, confessing that she feels deeply attracted to Guybrush, which he reciprocates. She implores Guybrush to finish his pirate trials before they act on their new-found love, but is kidnapped by LeChuck and taken to his hideout on Monkey Island when the ghost pirate's crew suddenly raids the island. Guybrush mounts a rescue attempt, but fails to reach Elaine before LeChuck's ship returns to Mêlée Island for LeChuck's wedding to Elaine. The well-intentioned Threepwood gatecrashes the wedding, but in actuality ruins Elaine's own plan to defeat LeChuck with an anti-ghost concoction. Guybrush still manages to destroy LeChuck, and the game closes with the <b>happy</b> <b>couple</b> watching the fireworks as the evil pirate's ghost form explodes.|$|E
