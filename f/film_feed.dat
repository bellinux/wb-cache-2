40|$|Abstract: The belt-finishing {{process is}} a recent {{manufacturing}} technique in industry, the mechanisms and characteristics of which {{have not yet been}} fully explained. This paper attempts to make a contribution {{to the understanding of the}} consequences of the process on the surface roughness of surfaces prepared by hard turning. Abrasive film wear and contact parameters between grains and surfaces are analysed. The effects and significant interactions of the most influential belt-finishing parameters on the surface roughness are then investigated. It was shown that the applied force and the hardness of the roller have a great influence on the surface roughness. Furthermore, the <b>film</b> <b>feed</b> rate influences considerably the wear of grains and, as a consequence, this parameter has an important impact on the material removal mode and on the surface roughness...|$|E

40|$|Laparoscopic graspers {{require a}} high pinch force to {{generate}} sufficient friction force (grip) for tissue manipulation. Excessive or insufficient pinch forces distributed along the small contact area of laparoscopic graspers can cause damage and {{are one of}} the reasons why the risk of intraoperative complications during Minimally Invasive Surgery (MIS) procedures in the abdomen is 2 - 4 % higher compared to open surgery. The goal of this research was to develop and evaluate an 5 mm laparoscopic grasper, which has the same functionality (generated friction force, grasping time) as a conventional grasper for use on the intestine but which requires lower pinch force due to the use of adhesives. To lower the pinch force the adhesive component of the friction force was enlarged by introducing a muco-adhesive between tissue and grasper. To lower (local) high pressures a flat surface was used. Two experiments were conducted to find out in which direction the friction force generated by the adhesive film was the largest and to find the minimum required area of adhesive film to generate a force of 5 N. Next, a design for the tip and a design for the adhesive <b>film</b> <b>feed</b> mechanism was made. To evaluate the design a prototype was created, which was used to investigate whether the proposed tip design was able to generate a friction force of 5 N using a pinch force lower than 3 N. The prototype of the adhesive grasper was able to generate a friction force of 3. 12 ± 0. 58 N, while using a pinch force of 2. 5 N. The generated friction force did not meet the goal of 5 N, but the concept of lowering the pinch force by introducing an adhesive layer is promising; the pinch force needed by the proposed tip is lower compared to existing graspers and the friction force was independent of the generated pinch force. The friction force can be increased further by developing a new adhesive film or by increasing the contact area. BMDBioMechanical EngineeringMechanical, Maritime and Materials Engineerin...|$|E
40|$|The {{compliant}} {{metallic seal}} combines the noncontact {{feature of the}} labyrinth seal, the low leakage of a mechanical seal, and the compliant nature of the brush seal. It consists of several thin metallic elements or leaves mounted within a ring which is press fit into the housing, and in form, sort of resembles a lip seal sections wiping the shaft. A second set of overlapping cover leaves are placed {{on top of the}} shaft riding leaves which reduces leakage and provides stiffness. The leaves can be straight or angle cut. The shaft riding fingers are designed with mismatched curvature to provide lift off similar to the Rayleigh lift pads in mechanical seals with leading edge clearances nearly twice those of the trailing edge as as shown by Fleming to be optimal for gas flows in convergent seal passages. Leading edge clearances range from 300 to 500 microinches. Balance pockets beneath the leaves provide fluid <b>film</b> <b>feed</b> to the 'Rayleigh lift' surface and the proper balance ratio (mechanical seal) when combined with the static pressure and film pressure. The leaves flex in the radial direction and accommodate thermomechanical behavior as well as axial motion and angular misalignment. In the static mode, there is a net closing force on the leaves. The seals were tested to 70 psi at speeds to 16, 000 rpm or surface speeds to 330 fps and temperatures from ambient to 440 F. A slow cycle through the rig critical at 10, 000 rpm induced a radial vibration response of 0. 004 to 0. 005 inch were accommodated by the seal. Preliminary performance data are encouraging demonstrating hydrodynamic liftoff and noncontacting operation at pressure and speeds typical of gas turbine engines. The leakage performance data are significantly better than commercial labyrinth and brush seals which should be expected as this design incorporates the features of the low leakage face or mechanical seal along with the flexibility of the brush configuration...|$|E

50|$|A {{variety of}} largely {{proprietary}} gauges were devised for the numerous camera and projection systems being developed independently {{in the late}} 19th century and early 20th century, ranging from 13 mm to 75 mm (0.51-2.95 in), {{as well as a}} variety of <b>film</b> <b>feeding</b> systems.

Film 35 mm wide with four perforations per frame became accepted as the international standard gauge in 1909, and remained by far the dominant film gauge for image origination and projection until the advent of digital photography and cinematography, despite challenges from smaller and larger gauges, because its size allowed for a relatively good trade-off between the cost of the film stock {{and the quality of the}} images captured.|$|R

The coastal forests and mangroves are home to Zanzibar red colobus and mudskippers. Tree-climbing crabs feed on fresh mangrove leaves, but must descend to escape the midday sun. North of the Tropics, the Red Sea coast receives little rainfall due to the dry heat and intense evaporation. Corals thrive in the clear, warm waters and the reefs here harbour moray eels, redtoothed triggerfish and clownfish. Pelagic fish shown include barracuda, devil rays and a school of manta rays <b>filmed</b> <b>feeding</b> in formation in a Sudanese bay. On the Mediterranean coast, Eleonora's falcons time their breeding {{to coincide with the}} passage of migrating birds. Up to two million migrant waders overwinter at the Banc d’Arguin mudflats in Mauritania. The seas of equatorial West Africa are heated by the Guinea Current which brings high rainfall to the coast. Here, elephants and hippos are shown moving through the mangroves and red river hogs feeding on sandy beaches. Further south, the Namib Desert extends to the coast. The cold Atlantic waters are rich feeding grounds for Cape fur seals and penguins. Fur seal pups are vulnerable in the heat, and those that perish are picked off by black-backed jackals and brown hyenas. Around the Cape, great white sharks use a unique hunting technique to catch seals.|$|R
