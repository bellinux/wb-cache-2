5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} on 8May several satellite experts questioned the analysis of satellite pings made by Inmarsat staff because the Doppler frequency shifts measured were apparently not properly corrected against the satellite's own drift (a periodic North-South oscillation of 3° every 24hours). Without any additional data being released, the <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> new analysis was that the northern portion of the Inmarsat satellite pings arc could not be ruled out. The Malaysian government released the satellite data three weeks later.|$|E

The <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is that the Mayas had access to aspects of ancient knowledge, spiritualism, philosophy, and religion that are useful for coping with the modern world, whether by avoiding Armageddon, embracing a mystical Apocalypse, or constructing a future Utopia.|$|E

25|$|In simple terms, he {{believes}} that the singularity in Einstein's field equation at the Big Bang is only an apparent singularity, similar to the well-known apparent singularity at the event horizon of a black hole. The latter singularity can be removed by a change of coordinate system, and Penrose proposes a different change of coordinate system that will remove the singularity at the big bang. One <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is that the major events at the Big Bang can be understood without unifying general relativity and quantum mechanics, and therefore we are not necessarily constrained by the Wheeler–DeWitt equation, which disrupts time. Alternatively, one can use the Einstein–Maxwell–Dirac equations.|$|E
25|$|The policy {{conflict}} {{had become}} a test of wills. And it soon grew into a constitutional conflict, reminiscent of the crisis of 1618. The majority in the States of Holland now revived the old constitutional theory of Oldenbarnevelt and Hugo Grotius, stating that the provinces' sovereignty, and not that of the federal state, was supreme, and that Holland was entitled to disband troops that were paid out of its contribution to the federal war budget, {{without the consent of}} the other provinces. The <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> was, of course, that the dissolution of the Union was a possibility, with a probability of civil war.|$|E
25|$|Some {{authors have}} noted the {{connection}} of attachment theory with Western family and child care patterns characteristic of Bowlby's time. The <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> connection is that attachment-related experiences (and perhaps attachment itself) may alter as young children's experience of care change historically. For example, changes in attitudes toward female sexuality have greatly increased the numbers of children living with their never-married mothers and being cared for outside the home while the mothers work. This social change, in addition to increasing abortion rates, has also {{made it more difficult}} for childless people to adopt infants in their own countries, and has increased the number of older-child adoptions and adoptions from third-world sources. Adoptions and births to same-sex couples have increased in number and even gained some legal protection, compared to their status in Bowlby's time.|$|E

25|$|The {{identity}} fusion construct builds upon {{earlier work}} by emphasizing {{aspects of the}} relationship of people to groups that were de-emphasized within the social identity perspective (i.e., social identity theory and self-categorization theory). Like social identity theory, identity fusion theory rests on the distinction between the personal and social identities. However, the social identity approach assumes that there is a hydraulic relationship between personal and social identities. That is, the increases in the salience and influence of one identity diminishes the salience and influence of the other. One important <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> assumption is that as the group identity becomes salient and apt to guide behavior, the personal identity becomes less salient and less likely to guide behavior. In contrast, the theory of identity fusion theory proposes that both the personal and social identities of a person can be salient and influential simultaneously.|$|E
25|$|The {{physiological}} {{model is}} based upon three major findings in people with insomnia; firstly, increased urinary cortisol and catecholamines have been found suggesting increased activity of the HPA axis and arousal; second increased global cerebral glucose utilization during wakefulness and NREM sleep in people with insomnia; and lastly increased full body metabolism and heart rate in those with insomnia. All these findings taken together suggest a dysregulation of the arousal system, cognitive system and HPA axis all contributing to insomnia. However, it is unknown if the hyperarousal is a result of, or cause of insomnia. Altered levels of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA have been found, but {{the results have been}} inconsistent, and the implications of altered levels of such a ubiquitous neurotransmitter are unknown. Studies on whether insomnia is driven by circadian control over sleep or a wake dependent process have shown inconsistent results, but some literature suggests a dysregulation of the circadian rhythm based on core temperature. Increased beta activity and decreased delta wave activity has been observed on electroencephalograms; however, the <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is unknown.|$|E
25|$|In {{talks between}} Prime Minister Erlander and Commander-in-Chief Swedlund in 1959, Erlander {{confirmed}} that the program on enhanced defense research would give results {{with regard to the}} warhead design. He emphasized, however, that he was uncertain about the effect it would have on the nuclear weapons issue and would delay the final decision on production until closer to the estimated date of completion in 1963. Thus, Palme preferred to postpone the crucial decision for years, with the goal of avoiding a serious split in the party, as opposed to a difficult compromise necessary to satisfy the desires of both sides for the long run. The <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> doctrine meant that almost any nuclear weapons research could be pursued under the terms “defense research” and “freedom of action”, while the Social Democratic leadership and the government had partially included the nuclear opponents’ lines in their public declarations. With the nuclear opponents essentially co-opted, AMSA's activity was diminished, and the Swedish peace movement started focusing primarily on advocating reduction of nuclear arsenals in the major nuclear powers. When the government brought up the issue in 1961, Erlander said that he himself now swung in the negative direction regarding the nuclear program, as compared to his views 3–4 years earlier, which he had never announced publicly. The decision that was expected {{to be made in the}} coming years remained suspended. The research was continued and the freedom of action doctrine was intact. Erlander's scientific adviser, Torsten Gustafson, was one of those advocating for the continued investment in research.|$|E

25|$|Cerebral {{activation}} {{during performance}} on three cognitive tasks (verbal learning, arithmetic, and divided attention) were compared after both normal sleep and 35 hours of total sleep deprivation (TSD) {{in a study}} by Drummond and Brown. Use of fMRI measured these differences in the brain. In the verbal learning task, fMRI indicated the regions involved in both verbal learning and memorization. The results found that both TSD and a normal night of sleep showed a significant response in the prefrontal cortex and following TSD displayed a response of additional areas which included other prefrontal areas, bilateral inferior parietal lobule and superior parietal lobes. Increases in sleepiness also correlated with activation of two ventral prefrontal regions and a correlation between a greater activation in bilateral parietal lobes (which include language areas) and lower levels of impairment on free recall were also found following TSD. In the arithmetic task normal sleep showed the expected activation in the bilateral prefrontal and parietal working memory regions but following TSD only showed activation in the left superior parietal lobe and the left premotor cortex in response, with no new areas to compensate (as was found in verbal learning). Increased sleepiness was also correlated with activation in a ventral prefrontal region, but only one region. The divided attention task combined both verbal learning and the arithmetic task. fMRI indicated that cerebral response after TSD {{is similar to that of}} the verbal learning task (specifically the right prefrontal cortex, bilateral parietal lobes, and cingulate gyrus showing the strongest response). The <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> finding is that additional brain regions activated after both verbal learning and divided attention tasks following TSD represent a cerebral compensatory response to lacking sleep. For example, there is a decline in response of the left temporal lobes during both tasks which is involved in different learning tasks during a rested state but involvement of the left inferior parietal lobe in short-term verbal memory storage following TSD suggests that this region might compensate. No new areas for the arithmetic task may suggest that it relies heavily on working memory so compensation is not possible, in comparison to tasks such as verbal learning which rely less on working memory.|$|E
500|$|The reentry of ejecta into Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{would include}} a brief (hours long) but intense pulse of infrared radiation, killing exposed organisms. A paper in 2013 by a prominent modeler of nuclear winter suggested that the global debris layer deposited by the impact contains enough soot to hint that the entire terrestrial biosphere burned, with an <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> being that this would have caused a global soot-cloud blocking out the sun, creating the nuclear winter effect. The suggestion that global firestorms occurred is debated, however, with opponents arguing that while ferocious fires probably did result locally, ferocious fires do not necessarily equal firestorms, and any such ferocious fires were instead limited to the immediate American continent. This disagreement between researchers is termed the [...] "Cretaceous-Palaeogene firestorm debate." ...|$|E
500|$|Schwalbach later {{replaced}} the piano-like keys with [...] "buttons" [...] and positioned them into four banked rows. [...] The {{mechanics of the}} machine, however, made the alphabetical arrangement problematic. The typebars were attached to the circumference of a metal ring, forming a [...] "basket". When a key was pressed, the corresponding typebar would swing upwards, causing the print head to strike {{at the center of}} the ring. Gravity would then return the typebar to its initial position. The <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> design, however, was that pressing adjoining keys in quick succession would cause their typebars to collide and jam the machine. To mitigate this problem, keys were reordered using analysis of letter frequency and trial and error. Densmore asked his son-in-law, a Pennsylvania school superintendent, what letters and combinations of letters appeared most often in the English language. Typebars corresponding to letters in commonly occurring alphabetical pairs, such as S and T, were placed on opposite sides on the ring. The keyboard ultimately presented to Remington was arranged as follows: ...|$|E
