5|$|In 2016, the {{estimated}} number of dinosaur species {{that existed in}} the Mesozoic era was estimated to be 1,543–2,468. Some are herbivorous, others carnivorous, including seed-eaters, fish-eaters, insectivores, and omnivores. While dinosaurs were ancestrally bipedal (as are all modern birds), some prehistoric species were quadrupeds, and others, such as Ammosaurus and Iguanodon, could walk <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> on two or four legs. Cranial modifications like horns and crests are common dinosaurian traits, and some extinct species had bony armor. Although known for large size, many Mesozoic dinosaurs were human-sized or smaller, and modern birds are generally small in size. Dinosaurs today inhabit every continent, and fossils show that they had achieved global distribution by at least the early Jurassic period. Modern birds inhabit most available habitats, from terrestrial to marine, and there is evidence that some non-avian dinosaurs (such as Microraptor) could fly or at least glide, and others, such as spinosaurids, had semi-aquatic habits.|$|E

The Reed–Solomon codes can correct a corrupted symbol with a single bit error <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> as it can correct a symbol with all bits wrong. This makes the RS codes particularly suitable for correcting burst errors. By far, the most common application of RS codes is in compact discs. In addition to basic error correction provided by RS codes, protection against burst errors due to scratches on the disc is provided by a cross interleaver.|$|E
25|$|The next {{feature to}} be {{discussed}} is the oval shaped curves representing islands of constant efficiency. In this figure we see 11 contours ranging from 56% efficiency (decimal 0.56) to 76% efficiency (decimal 0.76). General standard practice is to interpret these efficiencies as isentropic rather than polytropic. The inclusion of efficiency islands effectively generates a 3-dimensional topology to this 2-dimensional map. With inlet density specified, it provides a further ability to calculate aerodynamic power. Lines of constant power could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> be substituted.|$|E

500|$|Stephen of Blois, a Crusade leader, was in Alexandretta when {{he learned}} of the {{situation}} in Antioch. It seemed like their situation was hopeless so he left the Middle East, warning Alexios and his army {{on his way back to}} France. Because of what looked like a massive betrayal, the leaders at Antioch, most notably Bohemond, argued that Alexios had deserted the Crusade and thus invalidated all of their oaths to him. While Bohemond asserted his claim to Antioch, not everyone agreed (most notably Raymond of Toulouse), so the crusade was delayed for the rest of the year while the nobles argued amongst themselves. When discussing this period, a common historiographical viewpoint advanced by some scholars is that the Franks of northern France, the Provençals of southern France, and the Normans of southern Italy considered themselves separate [...] "nations", creating turmoil as each tried to increase its individual status. Others argue that while this may have had something to do with the disputes, personal ambition among the Crusader leaders might <b>just</b> be <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> blamed.|$|R

If this were true, it would make Luke the only writer of the New Testament who can clearly be identified as not being Jewish. However, {{that is not the}} only possibility. Although Luke is considered likely to be a Gentile Christian, some scholars believe him to be a Hellenized Jew. The phrase could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> be used to differentiate between those Christians who strictly observed the rituals of Judaism and those who did not.|$|E
25|$|The Yagura castle is {{considered}} by many to be the strongest defensive position in shogi. A common Yagura structure is the Gold Yagura. It has a strongly protected king; a well-fortified line of pawns; and the bishop, rook, and a pawn all support a later attack by the rook's silver or knight. It is notoriously difficult to break down with a frontal assault, though it is weaker from the side. It is typically used against Static Rook openings that involve advancing the rook's pawn. However, one's opponent may <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> adopt this defense, giving neither side an advantage.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} an in vitro protocol for quickly generating overlapping terminal-labeled restriction fragments for DNA sequence analysis via the Maxam-Gilbert technique. The protocol involves introducing mercurated nucleotides into {{one end of}} a region to be sequenced, partial digestion with several restriction enzymes and terminal-labeling, separation of the mercurated restriction enzymes and terminal-labeling, separation of the mercurated restriction fragments from non-mercurated ones on a thiol column and resolution of the different mercurated fragments on one preparative agarose gel. The protocol was used to determine the nucleotide sequence of a 980 base pair cDNA that contains the coding region for a variable surface glycoprotein of Trypanosoma brucei. It could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> quickly and <b>easily</b> be used to obtain many terminal-labeled overlapping restriction fragments covering a region of several kilobases...|$|R

25|$|The ‘‘hiding’’ effect {{takes into}} account the fact that, while small grains are {{inherently}} more mobile than large grains, on a mixed-grain-size bed, they may be trapped in deep pockets between large grains. Likewise, a large grain on a bed of small particles will be stuck in a much smaller pocket than if it were on a bed of grains of the same size, which the Meyer-Peter and Müller formula refers to. In gravel-bed rivers, this can cause ‘‘equal mobility", in which small grains can move <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> as large ones. As sand is added to the system, it moves away from the ‘‘equal mobility’’ portion of the hiding function to one in which grain size again matters.|$|E
25|$|Liquid {{chromatography}} (LC) is {{a method}} {{that in some ways}} is more powerful than GC, but can be coupled to mass spectrometry <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily.</b> In LC, the concerns involving sample preparation can be minimal. In LC, both the stationary and mobile phase can affect the separation, whereas in GC only the stationary phase should be influential. This allows for the sample preparation to be minimal if one is willing to adjust the stationary phase or mobile phase before running the sample. The primary concern is the concentration of analyte. If the concentration is too high then separation can be unsuccessful, but mass spectrometry as a detection method does not need complete separation, showing another benefit of coupling LC to a mass spectrometer.|$|E
25|$|Animals {{which are}} {{considered}} too slow moving to be 'free' {{are not included}} in this category, as trapping them doesn't change their legal status of being able to grab them in 'one hand swoop' (a term used by the Rambam to define this law). One is therefore allowed to confine a snail or tortoise, etc. as you can grab them <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> whether they are in an enclosure or unhindered in the wild. For these purposes trapping them serves no change to their legal status regarding their ease of capture, and they are termed legally pre-trapped due to their nature. Trapping is therefore seen not as a 'removal of liberty', which caging even such a slow moving creature would be, but rather the confining of a creature {{to make it easier to}} capture in one's hand.|$|E

25|$|The radio {{receiver}} {{turned out to}} be a more difficult problem. Early on they decided to use the same basic receiver system as the earlier Mk. IV radar. This had originally been a television receiver designed by Pye Ltd. to pick up BBC transmissions on 45MHz. It was adapted to the MK. IV's ~200MHz by using it as the intermediate frequency stage of a superheterodyne system. To do this, they had added another tube that stepped down the frequency from the radar's 193MHz to 45MHz. In theory this should be <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> adapted to the AIS's 3GHz, using a similar solution. The problem was that the magnetron's frequency tended to drift, in small amounts pulse-to-pulse, and much greater amounts as it heated and cooled. Any sort of fixed-frequency step-down like the one used in the Mk. IV wouldn't work. After trying a variety of designs based on klystrons and older-style magnetrons, they eventually gave up.|$|E
25|$|It was in 1943, {{while on}} {{holidays}} in Glengariff, West Cork, that Lynch met his future wife, Máirín O'Connor, {{the daughter of}} a Dublin judge. Lynch was to be her first and only boyfriend, and the couple were married three years later on 10 August 1946. Although she was apprehensive about her husband's decision to become active in politics, to become a Minister and even to become Taoiseach, she stood by him through it all and helped him make the tough decisions that would affect Lynch's life and her own. One story exists where Lynch, in spite of tremendous pressure from Seán Lemass and the entire Fianna Fáil party to stand for the leadership, only accepted the nomination after Máirín had agreed. The fact that the couple didn't have any children allowed Lynch to embark on a political career, without having to worry about his commitment to the family. However, he remained totally devoted to Máirín throughout his, and she became <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> recognisable as her husband.|$|E
25|$|As {{its name}} suggests, a shophouse often {{contains}} a shop with separate residential spaces. More generally, space {{occupied by the}} former contains a semi-public function. While this usually is, and historically usually was, a shop, it could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> be a food and beverage outlet (e.g. coffeeshop or bar), a service provider (e.g. clinic or barber), an industrial activity (e.g. cottage industry or auto workshop) or a community space (e.g. a school or clan association). Residential spaces are meant to accommodate one or more families, or serve as a dormitory for single workers. Popular belief holds that shophouses were initially occupied by single families, with their private living areas in one space and the more public family business in another. However, {{it is possible that}} the two spaces were always usually used by unrelated persons or groups, who may be tenants or resident owners. The position of the shop and residential space depends on the number of floors of the shophouse: A single storey shophouse tends to include residential space behind the shop, while residential spaces in shophouses of two or more storeys are typically located above the shop.|$|E
5000|$|Images {{often had}} арреаred {{to the artist}} in dreams and later materialized in her compositions. Maria Pryimachenko's art works depict fabulous mythological beasts and take their roots іn folk legends and fairy-tales, nourished bу real life {{and culture of the}} Ukrainian реорlе. The works of Pryimachenko can be {{subdivided}} into thematic, symbolic and ornamental pieces. All compositions are characterized by a subtle and fluent rhythmical arrangement. There is a maxim: [...] "Style makes man." [...] As for Pryimachenko, one can state this in reverse: man makes style, for Maria Pryimachenko has developed a style of her own. In this evolution one can discern traces of constructivism (1930s); the victory of harmony (1960s- 1970s); and the decorative approach (1980s). Her latest works impress one by their daring decorativeness of form. Pryimachenko gravitates to the world of fairy-tale and mystery: her birds, beasts and plants interact on her pictures <b>just</b> <b>as</b> harmoniously and <b>easily</b> <b>as</b> they do in natural surroundings. Philosophy of the good animates the content of her works. The good embodied in the images of 'kind' beasts and birds (lions, bears, hares, storks, swallows) is juxtaposed against the evil, this mighty force which is sometimes difficult to identify with certain living things. The artist often resorts to her favoured device of personification: she depicts fabulous animals with large eyes surrounded with a trim of eyelashes.|$|R
5000|$|As the war raged in Europe, the Kingdom of Yugoslavia {{had been}} spared, at least {{during the initial}} two years. Still, it hadn't done much {{to prepare for the}} inevitable, mostly because of {{unsettled}} national problems in the Kingdom. Therefore, as the German, Hungarian and Italian forces attacked on April 6, 1941, Yugoslavia simply fell apart after only two weeks of fighting. Many officers and soldiers, mostly from Serbia, had been taken prisoners of war and transported to the prisoner-of-war camps in Germany, Austria, Poland and as far as Norway. Although Negotin hadn't seen much of the fighting, in the summer of 1941, some guerilla resistance had been reported. Most of these [...] "partisan" [...] forces had been subsequently taken out of action during the summer and fall of 1941, with their fighters captured and killed. As {{for the remainder of the}} war, there hadn't been any major battles or atrocities recorded in the area. <b>Just</b> <b>as</b> the Germans <b>easily</b> and without resistance came in 1941, so did the Partisans and the Soviet troops, on their way to Belgrade and further.

25|$|Fortified {{military}} {{camps and}} watchtowers {{were also used}} on the southeast coast, in this case to stop migration and plundering by the Franks, Angles and Saxons. From about 270, {{attempts were made to}} gain the upper hand over the seaborne attacks of Germanic marauders using heavily fortified strongholds, some of which were newly built. In his chronicle of {{the second half of the}} 4th century Eutropius reported that the commander of the Classis Britannica, Carausius, was tasked in 285 with tackling Frankish and Saxon piracy in the English Channel. The constant raids on the local coasts hindered maritime traffic and in particular the safe transportation of goods and precious metals to Gaul and Rome. The heavily branched river system in Britain enabled the Germanic invaders to quickly penetrate the interior of the island in their small flat boats. As a countermeasure the Roman administration created a separate military district covering both sides of the English Channel. During Carausius' short-lived Britannic Empire, these strategically important fortresses and naval stations were probably manned by his most loyal officers and soldiers, who could <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>easily</b> repel Roman invaders. The exact date of its formation, however, is unknown. However, the military situation in Britain, which was already difficult, worsened still further. The local army command had to face new threats without having enough soldiers available and was therefore forced to withdraw troops from other vulnerable areas of the island.|$|E
