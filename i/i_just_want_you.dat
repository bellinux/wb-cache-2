500|$|In February 2014, Paul {{joined the}} Tea Party-affiliated {{conservative}} advocacy group FreedomWorks in filing a class-action lawsuit {{charging that the}} federal government's bulk collection of Americans' phone records metadata {{is a violation of}} the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution. Commenting on the lawsuit at a press conference, Paul said, [...] "I'm not against the NSA, I'm not against spying, I'm not against looking at phone records... <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to go to a judge, have an individual's name and [...] a warrant. That's what the Fourth Amendment says." [...] He also said there was no evidence the surveillance of phone metadata had stopped terrorism. Critics, including Harvard University law professor Alan Dershowitz and Steven Aftergood, the director of the American Scientists' Project on Government Secrecy, called the lawsuit a political [...] "stunt". Paul's political campaign organization said that the names of members of the public who went to Paul's websites and signed on as potential class-action participants would be available in the organization's database for future campaign use. On the announcement of the filing of the lawsuit, Mattie Fein, the spokeswoman for and former wife of attorney Bruce Fein, complained that Fein's intellectual contribution to the lawsuit had been stolen and that he had not been properly paid for his work. Paul's representatives denied the charge, and Fein issued a statement saying that Mattie Fein had not been authorized to speak for him on the matter and that he had in fact been paid for his work on the lawsuit.|$|E

2500|$|Sometime afterward, Bobby Kennedy {{obtained}} King's {{release from}} prison. Martin Luther King, Sr. was so {{grateful for the}} release that he voted for Kennedy and said [...] "I'll take a catholic or the devil himself if he'll wipe the tears from my daughter-in-law's eyes." [...] According to Coretta, Kennedy said [...] "I want to express my concern about your husband. I know this must be very hard on you.

2500|$|After {{recording}} {{her third}} studio album, As I Am, Keys began to [...] "find {{the way to}} totally be myself and what that meant; figuring out what choices I wanted to make and not make in order to truly honor myself". She described The Element of Freedom as diverse, but noted {{that there is a}} [...] "balance". She explained that [...] "one side is strong and one side is vulnerable", which she pointed to as the theme of the album. The album has a [...] "strong, edgy feel", but is also [...] "intimate and vulnerable and delicate". While on BET's 106 & Park, she described the album: [...] "The way that the songs progress [...] are gonna take you on a natural high. <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to feel a sense of freedom, I want you to feel out-of-the-box, feel inspired, You're definitely going to be taken on a trip, I know you're going to be shocked, you're going to hear things that you probably didn't think that I would sound like. It's a journey." [...] Keys revealed to The Times that in the period she was recording the album, she listened to artists such as Genesis, Tears for Fears, Fleetwood Mac and The Police.|$|E
2500|$|It {{could be}} that it is {{extremely}} difficult to start life. It might be that it is so difficult to start life that it has happened only once among all the planets... Let us consider, just as a conjecture, that the chance life starting when we have got suitable physical conditions is 10−100. I don't have any logical reason for proposing this figure, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to consider it as a possibility. Under those conditions ... it is almost certain that life would not have started. And I feel that under those conditions {{it will be necessary to}} assume the existence of a god to start off life. I would like, therefore, to set up this connexion between the existence of a god and the physical laws: if physical laws are such that to start off life involves an excessively small chance, so that it will not be reasonable to suppose that life would have started just by blind chance, then there must be a god, and such a god would probably be showing his influence in the quantum jumps which are taking place later on. On the other hand, if life can start very easily and does not need any divine influence, then I will say that there is no god.|$|E

2500|$|However, Akkad {{rejected}} the Etchison script, calling it [...] "too cerebral" [...] and insisting that any new Halloween sequel must feature Myers as a {{flesh and blood}} killer. In an interview, Etchison explained how he received the phone call informing him of the rejection of his script. Etchison said, [...] "I {{received a call from}} Debra Hill and she said, 'Dennis, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>you</b> to know that John and I have sold our interest in the title 'Halloween' and unfortunately, your script {{was not part of the}} deal." ...|$|R

2500|$|Following {{the success}} of their {{previous}} album, The Real Thing and its subsequent tour, Faith No More took a break {{for a year and a}} half before beginning work on the follow-up, Angel Dust. During this time Mike Patton rejoined his high-school band Mr. Bungle to record their eponymous début album. This situation had an effect on the band, since drummer Mike Bordin thought the writing process was like the state of a [...] "magic slate" [...] having been [...] "completely covered in writing; there was not any more room for any more writing on that slate, so we all went and said all right, and erased everything, and started writing new stuff," [...] and Patton was creatively revitalized. They decided not to [...] "play it safe" [...] and instead took a different musical direction, much to the dismay of guitarist Jim Martin. [...] Martin also didn't like the title of the album as chosen by keyboardist Roddy Bottum. [...] In an interview taken while they were in the studio he said that [...] "Roddy [...] wanted to name it Angel Dust, I don't know why, <b>I</b> <b>just</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> to know that if it's named Angel Dust, it didn't have anything to do with me.|$|E
