5|$|DMSO {{is widely}} used as an {{alternative}} to water because it has a lower dielectric constant than water, and <b>is</b> <b>less</b> polar and so dissolves non-polar, hydrophobic substances more easily. It has a measurable pKa range of about 1 to 30. Acetonitrile <b>is</b> <b>less</b> basic than DMSO, and, so, in general, acids are weaker and bases are stronger in this solvent. Some pKa values at 25°C for acetonitrile (ACN) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) are shown in the following tables. Values for water are included for comparison.|$|E

5|$|Python allows boolean {{expressions}} {{with multiple}} equality relations {{in a manner}} that is consistent with general use in mathematics. For example, the expression a < b < c tests whether a <b>is</b> <b>less</b> than b and b <b>is</b> <b>less</b> than c. C-derived languages interpret this expression differently: in C, the expression would first evaluate a < b, resulting in 0 or 1, and that result would then be compared with c.|$|E

5|$|Sodium is now {{produced}} commercially {{through the}} electrolysis of molten sodium chloride, {{based on a}} process patented in 1924. This is done in a Downs cell in which the NaCl is mixed with calcium chloride to lower the melting point below 700°C. As calcium <b>is</b> <b>less</b> electropositive than sodium, no calcium will be deposited at the cathode. This method <b>is</b> <b>less</b> expensive than the previous Castner process (the electrolysis of sodium hydroxide).|$|E

5|$|A high {{obliquity}} {{would probably}} result in {{dramatic changes in}} the climate and may destroy the planet's habitability. When the axial tilt of the Earth exceeds 54°, the yearly insolation at the equator <b>is</b> <b>less</b> than that at the poles.

When nuclei fuse, the mass of the fused product <b>is</b> <b>less</b> than the mass of the original parts. This lost mass is converted to electromagnetic energy, according to the mass–energy equivalence relationship E=mc2.|$|E
5|$|Although sodium <b>is</b> <b>less</b> {{reactive}} than potassium, {{this process}} works because at such high temperatures potassium is more volatile than sodium and {{can easily be}} distilled off, so that the equilibrium shifts towards the right to produce more potassium gas and proceeds almost to completion.|$|E

5|$|Chemically, {{actinium}} {{is similar}} to lanthanum, which is explained by their similar ionic radii and electronic structure. Like lanthanum, actinium has oxidation of +3, but it <b>is</b> <b>less</b> reactive and has more pronounced basic properties. Among other trivalent actinides Ac3+ is least acidic, i.e. has the weakest tendency to hydrolyze in aqueous solutions.|$|E

Clotted cream, {{especially}} clotted cream from Devon, where it <b>is</b> <b>less</b> yellow due to lower carotene levels in the grass, is regularly used in baking.

5|$|Dactyl shares many {{characteristics}} with Ida. Their albedos {{and reflection}} spectra are very similar. The small differences {{indicate that the}} space weathering process <b>is</b> <b>less</b> active on Dactyl. Its small size would make the formation of significant amounts of regolith impossible.
