[...] He stated in 2001: [...] "I have a growing appreciation for that which is simple and natural. <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> from the outdoors, and seeing the accumulation of clutter and waste and not being too happy about it." ...|$|E
500|$|Acknowledging the album's lack of {{commercial}} success, Dixon {{said she would}} always prefer to [...] "take a chance creatively" [...] than release what she perceived to be stultifying records. She commented: [...] "I knew the single 'Drummer Boy' was a risk. It {{was a very difficult}} record and so far removed from anything I'd done before. <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>that...</b> I take full responsibility for that, but I'm glad I did it. I'd rather make a unique record like 'Drummer Boy' and have it fail than play it safe and release bland, generic music that doesn't excite me." ...|$|E
500|$|Musically, {{the album}} {{incorporates}} elements of baile funk, grime, hip hop, and ragga. Peter Shapiro, writing in The Times, {{summed up the}} album's musical influences as [...] "anything {{as long as it}} has a beat". Some tracks drew on Tamil film music, which M.I.A. listened to while growing up. Shapiro described her music as a [...] "multi-genre pile-up" [...] and likened it to her graphic art, calling it [...] "vivid, gaudy, lo-fi and deceptively candyfloss". In a 2005 interview, when asked about the difficulty in categorising her sound, M.I.A. explained, [...] "Influences are crossing over into each other's puddles. I just accept where I'm at, I accept where the world is at and I accept how we receive and digest information. <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> somebody in Tokyo is on the internet instant messaging, and someone in the favelas is on the internet. Everybody seems to know a little bit about everything and that's how we process information now. This just reflects that." ...|$|E

500|$|Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly {{agreed that}} the episode was [...] "another solid 30 Rock", but was {{somewhat}} less positive, writing that it [...] "didn't quite slay me like the last few episodes have." [...] In addition, Lyons was not thrilled with [...] the Jenna character, reporting [...] "It's {{been a long time}} since we've seen Jenna do something redemptive – and I'd settle for anything not strenuously vacant and narcissistic. <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> that's her bit, but... that note is starting to drive me crazy." [...] IGN contributor Robert Canning also delivered a mixed review of the episode, writing that he laughed [...] "quite a bit" [...] but said it ultimately [...] "felt like it could have been so much more." [...] Canning also concluded his review by stating that it [...] "fell shy of being an absolute classic." [...] Writing for The Palm Beach Post Kevin D. Thompson said [...] "While last night's episode was far from unwatchable, it wasn't one of the show's best, either. But as I've written before, a so-so 30 Rock is still better than 99 percent of TV's other so-called comedies." [...] Thompson noted that he was not thrilled with the return of Dean Winters as Dennis, and called his plot with Liz and Jenna [...] "the show's least interesting plot".|$|E
500|$|Poptimal Tanya Lane wrote, [...] "Wow…just wow. Grey's Anatomy {{has once}} again managed to shock with its season finale." [...] While she {{appreciated}} the [...] "realism and authenticity that Grey's is known for", she found the episode was [...] "almost too much" [...] as it was [...] "extremely gory and difficult to watch, initially because of the grisly wounds" [...] but later because of the [...] "heavy and emotional things that transpired". She thought Pompeo gave one of her best performances when her character learned that her sister was dead. Digital Spy Ben Lee found Leigh's and Dane's performances [...] "phenomenal" [...] and added that he had probably never seen a better performance from Dane. He described the moment the two actors shared as [...] "truly poignant". To him, Lexie's death felt like a finale, which was thus too early. As for {{what was happening in}} Seattle Grace, he thought it was [...] "a bit pointless" [...] and [...] "uninteresting" [...] except Altman's departure, which he deemed [...] "the most significant moment at the hospital". Entertainment Weekly Tanner Stransky commented of Lexie's death: [...] "It was an intense death. I mean, how awful was it to watch one of Grey’s longest-running characters pass away so quickly -- and rather unceremoniously? <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> Ms. Rhimes had to do what she had to do -- and every show needs to be shaken up once in a while -- but I don't love that Lexie was the one to die. Could it have been someone less important somehow? I guess it would have been too obvious to do Kepner. And you probably just don't kill off a hottie like Mark Sloan, right?" [...] Stransky also complained about Robbins' screams {{at the beginning of the}} episode, but enjoyed Bailey's story.|$|E
500|$|Westley {{subsequently}} {{went about}} overhauling the squad {{ahead of the}} 2012–13 season. In May 2012, Preston announced that 21 players would be leaving the club; 14 of which were released {{at the end of}} their contracts, while a further seven were transfer-listed. Preston signed 18 players during the summer transfer window, including Scott Laird, John Mousinho, Joel Byrom, and [...] Chris Beardsley, four players from Westley's former club, Stevenage. Westley stated a desire for the new group of players to be committed to his ideas [...] "My job is to develop a plan that would see the club back on an upward curve. The plan is in place. I'm looking forward to working with a group that thinks along the same lines that I do". Preston started the season well, beating Championship side Huddersfield Town 2–0 at Deepdale in the League Cup. Later on in the month, Preston went on to secure consecutive 4–1 home victories, beating Crystal Palace and Swindon Town respectively, as well as defeating Hartlepool United 5–0 a month later. However, the club went on to win just two leagues matches in a four-month period from October 2012 to February 2013. A day after Preston's 3–1 away defeat to Yeovil Town on 12 February 2013, the club released a statement announcing Westley had been sacked. With Preston sitting just five points above the relegation zone, it was revealed that [...] "the board felt that a change of manager was the only way forward". On his time at Preston, Westley stated he had to [...] "slash the wage bill by 60 percent", and as a result the [...] "re-building was well underway but the club lost confidence in me whilst I was doing it. They just want results. Short-term pain is necessary sometimes. It was necessary at Preston. And the fans got restless. <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>that.</b> Just as managers have to be brave enough to grit their teeth and face up to that, so owners have to be brave at difficult times. And they have to be able to understand the issues. I knew the answers to problems but I wasn't being allowed to solve all the problems".|$|E

Guest performers included singer Gaby Moreno; songwriter-producer Joe Henry; Grizzly Bear's Edward Droste; New Zealand singer-songwriter Kimbra; and jazz guitarist-composer Grant Geissman. On upcoming projects, Parks said: [...] " [...] set poetry to music, to underscore poems. So I will still be performing once <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> done.

2500|$|Chenoweth {{was cast}} in a {{recurring}} role as a political reporter in the fourth season of The Good Wife (2012). However, she soon left the show because of serious injuries suffered on the set, where she sustained a skull fracture, broken nose, spinal and rib injuries, and cracked teeth. She appeared in the 2012 season opener and returned in a short scene for another episode. In 2013 and 2014, she made two appearances as Brittany Gold on the TV series, Kirstie. Chenoweth played Maleficent in the live-action Disney Channel original movie, Descendants. The Entertainment Weekly reviewer said that [...] "Chenoweth stole much of the show". It drew the largest cable TV movie audience of 2015 to that date. later that year, Chenoweth appeared in an episode of <b>I</b> <b>Get</b> <b>That</b> a Lot, posing as a waitress, and co-hosted the 69th Tony Awards, for which she was nominated for another Emmy Award.

2500|$|Smart {{regarded}} {{being able}} to draw the human being as {{the single most important}} attainment of any artist. When asked why none of the people in his pictures are ever painted smiling, he said that he could not draw smiles well. Unlike many primarily landscape artists, he could paint both the human form and the human face, {{as can be seen in}} his self-portrait work. He regarded abstract painters as people who never learnt to draw. Smart mostly painted with oil, acrylic and watercolours, generally using the bold primary colours – yellow, blue and red – and dark greys for his skies. This created an unusual effect in his works as the foregrounds of his paintings are fully lit despite the dark sky. His process of painting was a long and arduous one, resulting in barely a dozen finished canvases a year.

2500|$|As {{his policy}} for eradicating {{corruption}} inside {{the government had}} included many administrative reforms, he had to face high opposition. During the reformation of the prosecution, to resolve the opposition, he suggested a TV forum. The prosecutors insisted that Roh appointed the major positions of the prosecutor's office without consulting the personnel committee, and Roh answered that [...] "The current members of the personnel committee themselves represent the old prosecution which has to be changed, {{if we do not}} change now, it would sustain the old prosecution at least few months." [...] Three months into his presidency, He commented about the opposition problem, stating [...] "I'm worrying the opposition that maybe I cannot continue the presidency while <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>that</b> much of it." [...] That comment was quoted partly by conservative media, ('I cannot continue the presidency') and Roh was beset by skepticism about his ability and experience. Roh set the tone of his administration with a number of adventurous policies, and measures to uncover and reveal the names of the descendants of Japanese collaborators. The investigations, criticized by opposition parties as a covert means of attacking them, and coming too late to provide substantive redress, mostly resulted in damage to his own party members.|$|E
