25|$|This section deals {{primarily}} with Dmitri's wild and distraught pursuit of money so <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> away with Grushenka. Dmitri owes money to his fiancée Katerina and will believe {{himself to be}} a thief if he does not find the money to pay her back before embarking on his quest for Grushenka.

500|$|Although {{predominantly}} a striker, Samaras {{can also}} {{play as a}} left midfielder. During his time at Manchester City, Samaras expressed his disappointment at being used on the left of midfield too often, he publicly said to manager Sven-Göran Eriksson; [...] "I am not a left-midfielder, I am a striker and I like to play there," [...] However, after his move to Celtic, Samaras was more open to playing as a left midfielder. The Daily Mail {{said that this was}} because he was happier at Celtic and more willing to be a team player. In addition to being able to play as a target man, Samaras can also be used in several different roles when playing up front. His natural style of play is to drift off the front line and provide a link between the attack and midfield. In doing this he can use his pace and skill to run at the defence, while also creating chances or opening up space for his teammates. He can also run beyond the centre-backs and his pace means <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>run</b> on to through balls hit over the defence.|$|E
