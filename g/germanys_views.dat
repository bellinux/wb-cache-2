50|$|As <b>Germany</b> <b>viewed</b> Galicia {{as already}} {{partially}} aryanized and civilized, more non-Jewish Galicians escaped {{the full extent}} of German intentions than many other Ukrainians who lived more eastward. Despite the more lenient extent of German control for some of the Galician population, many Galicians, especially Jewish Galicians, were deported to concentration camps, much like elsewhere in Ukraine.|$|R

For example, in October 1939, Nazi {{propaganda}} was issued instructing Germans to view Poles, Jews and Gypsies as subhumans. Occasionally, signs were posted in public places reading: [...] "Entrance is forbidden to Poles, Jews, and dogs". When Germans wanted to silence Poles and Jews, they used such expressions, as [...] "stop barking" [...] or [...] "shut your snouts".|$|R

5000|$|As {{a result}} of the Greek government-debt crisis, {{starting}} in 2010, anti-Greek sentiments grew in some European countries, especially in Germany. A 2014 study found, [...] "An anti-Greek sentiment evolved and spread among German citizens and solidarity for crisis-hit Greece was mostly rejected." [...] In 2012 Pew Research Center found that [...] "Among the major European countries, Greece is clearly the least popular. And its reputation is slipping. In no country, other than Greece itself, is there a majority with a favorable view of Greece." [...] Only 27% of respondents in <b>Germany</b> <b>viewed</b> Greece favorably.|$|R

25|$|On 28 June 1919 the Weimar Republic was forced, {{under threat}} of {{continued}} Allied advance, to sign the Treaty of Versailles. <b>Germany</b> <b>viewed</b> the one-sided treaty as a humiliation and as blaming it for the entire war. While {{this was not the}} intent of the treaty, the notion took root in German society and was never accepted by nationalists, although it was argued by some, such as German historian Fritz Fischer. The German government disseminated propaganda to further promote this idea, and funded the Centre for the Study of the Causes of the War to this end.|$|R
40|$|During the European {{sovereign}} debt crisis, most countries that ran into fiscal trouble had Catholic majorities, whereas countries with Protestant majorities {{were able to}} avoid fiscal problems. Survey data show that, within <b>Germany,</b> <b>views</b> on the euro crisis differ between Protestants and Non-Protestants, too. Concerns about the euro crisis have increased among Protestants during the crisis, and significantly reduce their subjective wellbeing only. We use the timing of survey interviews and news events in 2011 {{to account for the}} endogeneity of euro concerns. Emphasis on moral hazard concerns in Protestant theology may, thus, still shape economic preferences...|$|R

5000|$|A {{note from}} Reich {{ambassador}} to the Holy See, Diego von Bergen, dated August 29, 1941 demanded that [...] "all ecclesiastical appointments to important posts in annexed or occupied regions be first communicated to Berlin". The note was meant to apply to all [...] "residential bishops, coadjutors with the right of succession, prelati nullius, apostolic administrators, capitular vicars, and all having equivalent functions {{in the government of}} a diocese". Explicitly included in this demand were Alsace, Lorraine, Luxembourg, lower Styria, Carinthia, and Carniole, as <b>Germany</b> <b>viewed</b> the right of consultation on appointments granted by the Reichskonkordat as extending to occupied territory.|$|R

5000|$|In {{the eyes}} of the Nazis, the war against the Soviet Union would be a Vernichtungskrieg, a war of annihilation. Racial policy of Nazi <b>Germany</b> <b>viewed</b> the Soviet Union (and all of Eastern Europe) as {{populated}} by non-Aryan Untermenschen ("sub-humans"), ruled by [...] "Jewish Bolshevik conspirators". Accordingly, it was stated Nazi policy to kill, deport, or enslave the majority of Russian and other Slavic populations according to the Generalplan Ost ("General Plan for the East"). The plan consisted of the Kleine Planung ("Small Plan") and the Große Planung ("Large Plan"), which covered actions to be taken during the war and actions to be implemented after the war was won, respectively.|$|R

50|$|By {{the early}} fifteenth century, the Catholic Church in <b>Germany</b> <b>viewed</b> heresy {{as a serious}} threat. It became a leading topic for {{discussion}} at the Council of Basel in 1431. Johannes Nider, a Dominican reformer who attended the council, became concerned that beliefs of the Free Spirit heresy, and other heresies, were mixed with elements of witchcraft. In his 1434 work, Formicarius, Nider combined the Free Spirit heresy with witchcraft in his condemnation of false teachings. Formicarius also became a model for Malleus maleficarum, a later work by Heinrich Kramer in 1486. By the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, the Church’s efforts to eradicate heresy and witchcraft resulted in heresy trials and the parallel civil authorities conducting witch burnings.|$|R
5000|$|The Western genre {{had never}} enjoyed the {{approval}} of the political establishment in the German Democratic Republic: the novels of Karl May, the most prominent German-language author associated with the topic, were not allowed to be re-published in the country until 1982. The Socialist Unity Party of Germany, the ruling power in East <b>Germany,</b> <b>viewed</b> May as a writer whose supposedly positive portrayal of the colonization of the Old West by the United States ignored the uprooting and genocide of Native Americans while glorifying the White settlers, making him a promoter and a precursor of an expansionist ideology of [...] "blood and soil" [...] and [...] in the words of Klaus Mann [...] the [...] "Cowboy mentor of the Führer".|$|R

50|$|The Centre for the Study of the Causes of the War (in German: Zentralstelle zur Erforschung der Kriegschuldfrage) was a pseudo-historical {{think-tank}} {{based in}} Berlin, {{funded by the}} German government, whose sole purpose was to disseminate the official government position that Germany {{was the victim of}} Allied aggression in 1914, and hence the alleged moral invalidity of the Versailles Treaty. Of the many provisions in the treaty, Article 231 required Germany to accept responsibility for the damages it caused during the war and, under the terms of articles 232-248, to disarm, make substantial territorial concessions and pay reparations to some of the victorious countries. Although neither the Entente powers at the time nor subsequent historical consensus attached the idea of war guilt to these articles, <b>Germany</b> <b>viewed</b> them as a humiliation and as being forced to accept full responsibility for causing the war.|$|R
