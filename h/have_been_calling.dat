25|$|The pan-democrats <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>calling</b> for the NPCSC {{decision}} to be shelved, but pro-Beijing politicians had said the decision would be still relevant after 2017.

25|$|Another {{aspect of}} the anti-Hungarian {{sentiment}} was the hatred of all the statues and monuments representing Austria-Hungary or Hungarian historical people. National socialist MPs of the Czechoslovak National Assembly <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>calling</b> {{for the conservation of}} such works of art, moving and preserving them in suitable place as early as 1920. The hatred however was not limited to sculptures only: Hungarian books were burned in Poprad and possibly other locations as well. Concurrently some of the statues were destroyed as well: the millennium monument along with the Árpád statue in Devín was blown up using dynamite,. The statue of Maria Theresa in Bratislava (pictured) was preserved until October 1921 when information about trial to restore monarchy spread in successor states of Austria-Monarchy. In the atmosphere of partial mobilization, martial law and fresh memories to invasion of Béla Kun's army, it was brought down using ropes tied to trucks. In Slovakia, memorials were destroyed mainly after intervention of Red Guards of Béla Kun in spring and summer 1919, when statues of Lajos Kossuth were destroyed in Rožňava, Lučenec, Dobšiná and Nové Zámky, also a statue of Ferenc Rákóczi in Brezno and numerous others. In almost all of these cases the perpetrators were the soldiers of the Czechoslovakian legion. Idleness of state authorities encouraged destroyers of statues. The government started to act only when the mob had begun to take over shops and properties of German entrepreneurs. Thereafter, Czechoslovak army and police intervened and destruction of symbols of monarchy stopped nearly for a year.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, the National Institute on Media and the Family {{criticized the}} ESRB for seldom-using the Adults Only rating {{because it has}} a vested {{interest}} in the video game industry, stating that [...] "study after study shows that ratings would be stricter if parents were doing the job. It took explicit porn to get [...] an AO rating, even though the original version, still rated M, rewards players whose on-screen persona had sex with prostitutes and then killed them. We <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>calling</b> for AO ratings for the Grand Theft Auto series for years—now it is clear why the ESRB has ignored our request." [...] The ESRB disputed these claims, arguing that the organization [...] "relies on flawed research and ignores any and all conflicting evidence", was [...] "imposing its own narrow values and morality {{on the rest of the}} country, regardless that it has little evidence to show that parents agree with their point of view", and did not reply to the ESRB's request for comments following its report card in 2004. The board also pointed out that the NIMF's study and [...] "report card" [...] used data from PSVRatings, a for-profit competitor to the ESRB.|$|E
500|$|In April 2010, six main {{characters}} were axed from EastEnders by executive producer Bryan Kirkwood.

[...] Heritage later called Fatboy an [...] "obnoxiously two-dimensional dubstep-fixated stock [...] transparently modelled on Jar Jar Binks." [...] A writer for the website Watch With Mothers called the character an asset to EastEnders, expressing pleasure that the show was trying to appeal to younger viewers, while another called him irritating and zany. A writer for The Northern Echo wondered if Fatboy, along with Leon and ZsaZsa, brought a new injection of life into the soap or took away screen time from more established characters, and Caroline Fitton, writing for the Daily Mail, felt that Fatboy's style of talking {{was a bit of a}} cliché.

2500|$|Milton's {{interpretation}} of God {{has been described}} as Arian. Kelley explains the actual usage of this term as he says, [...] "Milton may be quite correctly called an Arian if he holds an anti-Trinitarian view of God; and it is in this sense that scholars <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>calling</b> Milton an Arian since the publication of the De Doctrina in 1825." [...] In particular, Christian Doctrine denies the eternity of the Son, Jesus's pre-birth title. Such a denial separates the unity between God and the Son. However, some claim that the Son is eternal, since he was begotten before time, and that he represents part of the Logos. But this cannot be, as Kelley points out, [...] "Milton concludes, the Son was begotten not from eternity but 'within the limits of time.'" [...] Although some have argued that the Son is equal in some respects with God, the Son lacks the complete attributes of God.|$|E
2500|$|In November 2010, Sharp sent {{a camera}} crew to film some of Brown's exploits. After seeing the footage, a {{producer}} from Animal Planet visited Brown and challenged him to [...] "entertain [...] for 12 hours". Brown told the Herald-Leader {{that he took}} the producer on an outing in which he caught 11 turtles and a catfish. Following the producer's visit, Animal Planet decided to air a series of 12 half-hour episodes featuring Brown. Originally given the working title The Turtleman of Wild Kentucky, the name was changed to Call of the Wildman [...] a reference to Brown's signature yell. Brown describes the yell as [...] "an Indian yell" [...] and explains, [...] "I got a quarter Shawnee and a quarter Cherokee. The other quarter is white man – that's a Yankee, Union – and another quarter is Confederate". In addition, Brown frequently uses the catchphrase [...] "Live action!" [...] during the series.

2500|$|The Bill is modelled, {{more or less}} directly, on the {{proposals}} put forward by the European Commission for a draft Temporary and Agency Worker Directive (...) [...] This proposal was itself shelved, because of the UK government's consistent opposition to agency regulation, {{in the interests of}} labour market flexibility. According to newspaper reports, the UK got the backing of Germany to torpedo the draft Directive in return for the UK to help sink the Takeover Directive (Germany has comprehensive agency work regulation under its [...] and its Civil Code, esp §622, and the UK has strong Takeover Regulation, especially Rule 21 of the City Code). The significant difference between the proposed Directive and the Bill is that the former UK government managed to insert a 6 week qualification period in the Directive before the equal treatment rights click in (Art. 5(4)). The Bill has no proposed qualification period, though voices in the City <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>calling</b> for this to be one year. The latest reports suggest a 12 week qualifying period has been agreed between the private MP backers and the government, meaning a significant step back from the protection the Directive would offer. The Directive included equal treatment only for pay, hours, parental rights and anti-discrimination (Art. 3(1)(d)). A significant omission therefore was any regulation on reasonable notice before dismissal (in the UK, ERA s.86).|$|E
