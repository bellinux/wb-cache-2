5|$|On 9 July {{a meeting}} between Kluge, Model, Joachim Lemelsen and Josef <b>Harpe</b> {{was held at the}} {{headquarters}} of the XLVII Panzer Corps. It had become clear to the German commanders that the 9th Army lacked the strength to obtain a breakthrough, and their Soviet counterparts had also realized this, but Kluge wished to maintain the pressure on the Soviets in order to aid the southern offensive.|$|E
5|$|The Red Army {{started the}} Vistula–Oder Offensive on 12 January 1945. The attack {{began with an}} intense {{bombardment}} by the guns of the 1st Ukrainian Front against elements of Army Group A, initially {{under the command of}} Generaloberst Josef <b>Harpe.</b> Within a matter of days the Soviet forces involved had advanced hundreds of kilometres, taking much of Poland and striking deep within the borders of the Reich. The offensive broke Army Group A, and much of Germany's remaining capacity for military resistance. The Soviet forces crossed the Silesian border on 19 January and <b>Harpe</b> was relieved of his command and replaced by Generaloberst Ferdinand Schörner on 20 January. Schörner established his headquarters at Oppeln. Here Strachwitz, on crutches, went to see Schörner, requesting a front command to defend his homeland. Schörner declined the offer and Strachwitz insisted on another assignment. Bending to the request, Schörner initially kept him in his staff where Strachwitz conceived the plan of creating a specialized Panzerjagdbrigade (tank-hunting brigade). The 3rd Guards Tank Army conquered Oppeln and Groß Strehlitz on 23 January 1945. The following day Groß Stein fell {{into the hands of the}} advancing Red Army and Strachwitz's palace and entire estate were confiscated. Schörner yielded to the demands of Strachwitz, and authorized the creation of the Panzerjägerbrigade. These brigades were not mechanized units but rather infantry soldiers deploying hand-held weapons such as the Panzerfaust. On 30 January 1945, he was promoted to Generalleutnant of the Reserves and organized his staff of the Panzerjäger-Brigade Oberschlesien at Bad Kudova—present-day Kudowa-Zdrój in Kłodzko Land.|$|E

Unfortunately for Trabue, the famished <b>Harpes</b> found his son first. The son's blood-soaked dog returned to the cabin and led Trabue and Skaggs to the sinkhole where the <b>Harpes</b> had discarded the body. He had been brutally beaten and tomahawked, and his load of supplies was stolen. Skaggs and Trabue searched for days, but never found the <b>Harpes.</b>|$|R

25|$|Undoubtedly {{the most}} famous name in modern Breton music is Alan Stivell, who popularized the Celtic harp first in the fifties and sixties and on a wider level since the 1970s, {{with a series of}} albums {{including}} most famously Renaissance de la <b>Harpe</b> Celtique (1971). His first harps were built by his father; the Celtic harp was long forgotten in Brittany before.|$|E
25|$|There {{were three}} Armies in the Group; the 9th Army {{deployed}} around Warsaw, the 4th Panzer Army opposite the Baranow salient in the Vistula Bend, and the 17th Army to their south. The force {{had a total}} complement of 450,000 soldiers, 4,100 artillery pieces, and 1,150 tanks. Army Group A was led by Colonel-General Josef <b>Harpe</b> (who was replaced, after the offensive had begun, by Colonel-General Ferdinand Schörner on 20 January).|$|E

The ideals of the French Revolution found a receptive audience in Vaud, and when Vaud declared itself a republic the French had a pretext to invade the confederation.|$|E

25|$|The Red Army {{had built}} up their {{strength}} around {{a number of key}} bridgeheads, with two fronts commanded by Marshal Georgy Zhukov and Marshal Ivan Konev. Against them, the German Army Group A, led by Colonel-General Josef <b>Harpe</b> (soon replaced by Colonel-General Ferdinand Schörner), was outnumbered 5:1. Within days, German commanders evacuated the concentration camps, sending the prisoners on their death marches to the west, where ethnic Germans also started fleeing. In a little over two weeks, the Red Army had advanced 300 miles from the Vistula to the Oder, only 43 miles from Berlin, which was undefended. But Zhukov called a halt, owing to continued German resistance on his northern flank (Pomerania), and the advance on Berlin had to be delayed until April.|$|E
25|$|The {{direction}} of the boy's upbringing was entirely {{in the hands of}} his grandmother, the empress Catherine II. As in the case of her eldest grandson (afterwards the emperor Alexander I), she regulated every detail of his physical and mental education; but in accordance with her usual custom, she left the carrying out of her views to the men who were in her confidence. Count Nikolai Saltykov {{was supposed to be the}} actual tutor, but he too in his turn transferred the burden to another, interfering personally only on exceptional occasions, and exercised no influence upon the character of the passionate, restless and headstrong boy. The only person who exerted a responsible influence was Cesar La <b>Harpe,</b> who was tutor-in-chief from 1783 to May 1795 and educated both the empress's grandsons.|$|E
25|$|Not all emigrants made it {{to their}} destination. The dangers of the {{overland}} route were numerous: snakebites, wagon accidents, violence from other travelers, suicide, malnutrition, stampedes, Indian attacks, a variety of diseases (dysentery, typhoid, and cholera {{were among the most}} common), exposure, avalanches, etc. One particularly well-known example of the treacherous nature of the journey {{is the story of the}} ill-fated Donner Party, which became trapped in the Sierra Nevada mountains during the winter of 1846–1847 in which nearly half of the 90 people traveling with the group died from starvation and exposure, and some resorted to cannibalism to survive, as well as the story of infamous cannibal Alfred Packer and his trek to Colorado in 1874. There were also frequent attacks from bandits and highwaymen, such as the infamous <b>Harpe</b> brothers who patrolled the frontier routes and targeted migrant groups.|$|E

50|$|The {{importance}} of La <b>Harpe's</b> exploration {{is that it}} was one of the two first-known French contacts with the Wichita and Apache Indians and the first known French expedition to set foot in the future state of Oklahoma. La <b>Harpe’s</b> account of the expedition includes much information about the land he traversed and the Indians he met. The Wichita were probably grouped in such a large village as a defense from slave raids by the Osage and Apache. Within two or three decades the Wichita had moved south to the Red River where they became allies with the Comanche.|$|R

25|$|Louis XIV's long reign and wars {{had nearly}} bankrupted the French monarchy. Rather than reduce spending, the Regency of Louis XV of France {{endorsed}} the monetary theories of Scottish financier John Law. In 1716, Law {{was given a}} charter for the Banque Royale under which the national debt {{was assigned to the}} bank in return for extraordinary privileges. The key to the Banque Royale agreement was that the national debt would be paid from revenues derived from opening the Mississippi Valley. The Bank was tied to other ventures of Law—the Company of the West and the Companies of the Indies. All were known as the Mississippi Company. The Mississippi Company had a monopoly on trade and mineral wealth. The Company boomed on paper. Law was given the title Duc d'Arkansas. Bernard de la <b>Harpe</b> and his party left New Orleans in 1719 to explore the Red River. In 1721, he explored the Arkansas River. At the Yazoo settlements in Mississippi he was joined by Jean Benjamin who became the scientist for the expedition.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known map of {{the island}} and the bay was made by French explorer Bénard de La <b>Harpe</b> in 1721, who left the island unnamed but named the bay [...] "Port François." [...] In 1785, Spanish explorer José de Evia, during his own charting of the Gulf Coast, referred to the island as [...] "San Luis" [...] and the bay as [...] "Bahía de Galveztowm" [...] ("Galveztowm Bay"), in honor of Bernardo de Gálvez y Madrid, Count of Gálvez. The name San Luis for the island continued {{to be used by}} the Spanish and the Mexicans (and later even by Stephen F. Austin's colony).|$|E
500|$|Monteux's first {{high-profile}} conducting experience came in 1895, when he {{was barely}} 20 years old. He {{was a member of}} the orchestra engaged for a performance of Saint-Saëns's oratorio La lyre et la <b>harpe,</b> to be conducted by the composer. At the last minute Saint-Saëns judged the player engaged for the important and difficult organ part to be inadequate and, as a celebrated virtuoso organist, decided to play it himself. He asked the orchestra if any of them could take over as conductor; there was a chorus of [...] "Oui – Monteux!". With great trepidation, Monteux conducted the orchestra and soloists including the composer, sight-reading the score, and was judged a success.|$|E

50|$|Following {{the decisive}} British defeat by Patriot-French forces at Yorktown in 1781, the <b>Harpes</b> left North Carolina, {{dispersing}} with their Indian allies, the Chickamauga Cherokees, to Tennessee villages {{west of the}} Appalachian Mountains. On April 2, 1781, they joined war parties of four hundred Chickamauga to attack the Patriot frontier settlement of Bluff Station at Fort Nashborough (now Nashville, Tennessee), which would be assaulted by them again, on either July 20, 1788, or April 9, 1793. On August 19, 1782, the <b>Harpes</b> accompanied a British-backed Chickamauga Cherokee war party to Kentucky at the Battle of Blue Licks where they helped to defeat an army of Patriot frontiersmen led by Daniel Boone.|$|R
