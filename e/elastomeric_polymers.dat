Since these polymers exhibit the potential to be applied as retrofitting and protective material for various types of structural materials, in enhancing their load-carrying capacity, ductility and structural survivability under different loading regimes, it is essential to comprehensively investigate their mechanical behaviour at varying strain rates. This study was undertaken to investigate the tensile stress-strain characteristics of elastomeric PU at varying strain rates, ranging from 0. 001 s- 1 to 0. 1 s- 1 (low to intermediate). The primary emphasis of this study was on the strain rate sensitivity of the tensile properties, including the Young’s modulus, tangent modulus, ultimate tensile stress, fracture strain, and strain energy modulus.

Among the many <b>elastomeric</b> <b>polymers,</b> poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS) is a tough, synthetic biodegradable cross-linked elastomer that has been extensively studied {{for use as a}} scaffolding biomaterial in tissue engineering applications and regenerative medicine (Bettinger 2011).

Here, carbon nanosprings are used to adjust the viscoelasticity and reduce the resulting hysteresis loss (HL) of <b>elastomeric</b> <b>polymer</b> materials. Two types of nanospring‐filled elastomer composites are constructed as follows: system I is obtained by directly blending polymer chains with nanosprings; system II is composed of the self‐assembly of a tri‐block structure such as chain‐nanospring‐chain. Coarse‐grained molecular dynamics simulations show that the incorporation of nanosprings can improve the mechanical strength of the elastomer matrix through nanoreinforcement and considerably decrease the hysteresis loss. This finding is significant for reducing fuel consumption and improving fuel efficiency in the automobile tire industry. Furthermore, it is revealed that the spring constant of nanosprings and the interfacial chemical coupling between chains and nanosprings both play crucial roles in adjusting the viscoelasticity of elastomers. It is inferred that elastomer/carbon nanostructured materials with good flexibility and reversible mechanical response (carbon nanosprings, nanocoils, nanorings, and thin graphene sheets) have both excellent mechanical and low HL properties; this may open a new avenue for fabrication of high performance automobile tires and facilitate the large‐scale industrial application of these materials.
