5000|$|In Kim Stanley Robinson's {{novels and}} short stories, {{especially}} The Memory of Whiteness (1985), [...] "Mercurial" [...] (in The Planet on the Table, 1986), Blue Mars (1996), and 2312, Mercury {{is the home}} of a vast city called Terminator, populated by large numbers of artists and musicians. To avoid the dangerous solar radiation, the city rolls around the planet's equator on tracks, keeping pace with the planet's rotation so that the Sun never rises fully above the horizon. The motive power comes from solar <b>heat</b> <b>expanding</b> the rails on the day side. The city's rulers are called the Lions of Mercury.|$|E
50|$|Depending on the {{prospective}} {{short circuit current}} available at a switchgear line-up, a hazard is presented to maintenance and operating personnel due {{to the possibility of}} a high-intensity electric arc. Maximum temperature of an arc can exceed 10,000 kelvin, and the radiant <b>heat,</b> <b>expanding</b> hot air, and explosive vaporization of metal and insulation material can cause severe injury to unprotected workers. Such switchgear line-ups and high-energy arc sources are commonly present in electric power utility substations and generating stations, industrial plants and large commercial buildings. In the United States, the National Fire Protection Association, has published a guideline standard NFPA 70E for evaluating and calculating arc flash hazard, and provides standards for the protective clothing required for electrical workers exposed to such hazards in the workplace.|$|E
40|$|In warm climate {{the inside}} {{temperature}} in the living space is largely affected by the roof, which receives more than 50 % of the thermal load that acts on the building. The design and materials of the roof are able to minimize the thermal effects caused by the high heat of the tropics. Simulations with physical-mathematical calculations found the necessity of ventilated double roof. These simulations have also {{found out that the}} use of local materials in the design has greater significant results in the average inside temperature of the living space than the same design using standard industrial materials used in construction. The differences reaches 5 ºC in average inside temperature. Besides that, it was noticed that the increase of air has no effective cooling capacity of heat, although the flow of air inside the attic is significant because it prevents the <b>heat</b> <b>expanding</b> in this space...|$|E
50|$|The implant is cooled {{prior to}} surgery, and once implanted, body <b>heat</b> <b>expands</b> its width and shortens its length. Expansion secures the implant in place, while the {{shortening}} pulls the bones tightly together {{to encourage the}} natural fusion process. These compressive features reduce healing time.|$|R
5000|$|During construction, {{the setting}} {{concrete}} produces a exothermic reaction. This <b>heat</b> <b>expands</b> the plastic concrete {{and can take}} up to several decades to cool. When cooling, the concrete is in a stiff state and is susceptible to cracking. It is the designer's task to ensure this doesn't occur.|$|R
50|$|Examples of {{everyday}} heat engines include the steam engine {{and the internal}} combustion engine. The stirling engine is also heat engine, {{as well as the}} drinking bird toy. All of these heat engines are powered by the expansion of heated gases. The general surroundings are the heat sink, which provides relatively cool gases that, when <b>heated,</b> <b>expand</b> rapidly to drive the mechanical motion of the engine.|$|R

50|$|In 1915 Varna Palæet had a {{pavilion}} {{of glass}} added to better serve outdoor during the summer. In 1916 Aarhus Municipality added electrical lighting and in 1930 central <b>heating</b> which <b>expanded</b> {{the season with}} a few months.|$|R

5000|$|In {{one type}} of lightcraft, the laser shines on a {{parabolic}} reflector {{on the underside of}} the vehicle that concentrates the light to produce a region of extremely high temperature. The air in this region becomes <b>heated</b> and <b>expands</b> violently in a laser-supported detonation, producing thrust.|$|R

25|$|In the end, the Solwind ASAT test had few {{consequences}} for the planned U.S. space station as station completion was pushed beyond the mid-1990s. The record-high level of solar activity during the 1989–1991 solar maximum <b>heated</b> and <b>expanded</b> the atmosphere more than anticipated in 1985, accelerating Solwind debris decay.|$|R
50|$|In {{the course}} of {{investigating}} the slight differences discovered by William Hyde Wollaston in the angles of the rhombohedra of the carbonates isomorphous with calcite, Mitscherlich observed that this angle {{in the case of}} calcite varied with the temperature. On extending this inquiry to other allotropic crystals, he observed a similar variation, and was thus led, in 1825, to the discovery that allotropic crystals, when <b>heated,</b> <b>expand</b> unequally in the direction of dissimilar axes. In the following year he discovered the change, produced by change of temperature, {{in the direction of the}} optic axes of selenite. His investigation, also in 1826, of the two crystalline modifications of sulfur threw much light on the fact that the two minerals calcite and aragonite have the same composition but different crystalline forms, a property which Mitscherlich called polymorphism.|$|R
50|$|As air is <b>heated,</b> it <b>expands</b> and {{possesses}} less density (weight {{per unit}} volume) than cooler air. Therefore, the heated air rises and displaces the cooler air (the cooler air descends). The method of Dry-heat gravity convection produces inconsistent temperatures within the chamber {{and has a}} very slow turn over.|$|R
50|$|When <b>heated,</b> air <b>expands,</b> so a given {{volume of}} space {{contains}} less air. This makes it lighter and, if its lifting power {{is greater than}} the weight of the balloon containing it, it will lift the balloon upwards. A hot air balloon can only stay up while it has fuel for its burner, to keep the air hot enough.|$|R

50|$|The canal linked New York City {{with the}} rich coal {{deposits}} of the Carbondale, Wilkes-Barre and Scranton areas, providing fuel for both the city's industrial foundries and <b>heating</b> the <b>expanding</b> number of residences. In 1848, the New York and Erie Railroad was built through the area; although the canal continued to operate for another fifty years, railroads eventually made canals obsolete.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{coal gas}} for {{illumination}} and <b>heating</b> had <b>expanded</b> since its invention {{in the early}} 18th century by William Murdoch, a Scottish engineer. By {{the middle of the}} nineteenth century there were nearly one thousand gas companies within Great Britain with thirteen in London. Increasing competition had led to falling dividends and by the 1850s the industry welcomed change.|$|R
50|$|Wells {{lights were}} also used in the {{erection}} and repair of large stationary steam engines. Typically this was for the shrink-fitting of components such as large crankpins in crankshafts or flywheels. The crankshaft web would be <b>heated</b> to <b>expand</b> it until the pin could be slid or gently hammered into place. On cooling, the pin would be securely held in place.|$|R
40|$|Available at SciVerse ScienceDirectA {{study of}} {{chemical}} transformations of cork during heat treatments was made using colour variation and FTIR analysis. The cork enriched fractions from Quercus cerris bark {{were subjected to}} isothermal heating in the temperature range 150 – 400 ◦C and treatment time from 5 to 90 min. Mass loss ranged from 3 % (90 min at 150 ◦C) to 71 % (60 min at 350 ◦C). FTIR showed that hemicelluloses were thermally degraded first while suberin remained as the most heat resistant component. The change of CIE-Lab parameters was rapid for low intensity treatments where no significant mass loss occurred (at 150 ◦C L* decreased from the initial 51. 5 to 37. 3 after 20 min). The decrease in all colour parameters continued with temperature until they remained substantially constant with over 40 % mass loss. Modelling of the thermally induced mass loss could be made using colour analysis. This is applicable to monitoring the production of <b>heat</b> <b>expanded</b> insulation agglomerates...|$|R

5|$|A solar balloon {{is a black}} balloon that {{is filled}} with {{ordinary}} air. As sunlight shines on the balloon, the air inside is <b>heated</b> and <b>expands</b> causing an upward buoyancy force, much like an artificially heated hot air balloon. Some solar balloons are large enough for human flight, but usage is generally limited to the toy market as the surface-area to payload-weight ratio is relatively high.|$|R
30|$|Results of {{material}} internal temperature distributions {{are shown in}} Fig.  8. The materials temperature increase with the <b>heating</b> time <b>expand,</b> while temperatures of different area (‘A’/‘B’/‘C’ regions as shown in Fig.  6) are not the same. Temperatures in region ‘A’ and ‘C’ rise faster, and that of region ‘B’ lags behind the other regions. There is a low temperature point in region ‘B’ formed.|$|R

40|$|A density ball is {{a hollow}} metal sphere whose density is very nearly {{equal to the}} density of water near 30 ? Celsius. In cold water, 15 ? Celsius, the density ball floats with {{only a very small}} piece of the ball above the surface of the water, as shown in Figure 1. As the water is <b>heated,</b> it <b>expands,</b> so its density becomes less and the density ball sinks...|$|R
50|$|When <b>heated,</b> air <b>expands.</b> This lowers its {{density and}} creates lift. Small hot air {{balloons}} or lanterns have been flown in China since ancient times. The first modern man-lifting aerostat, {{made by the}} Montgolfier brothers, was a hot air balloon. Most early balloons however were gas balloons. Interest in the sport of hot air ballooning reawoke {{in the second half}} of the twentieth century and even some hot-air airships have been flown.|$|R
50|$|The {{artisans}} heated a {{glass tube}} over a flame, then inserted the tube into a clay mold, blowing the <b>heated</b> glass to <b>expand</b> {{into the shape}} of the mold. The original ornaments were only in the shape of fruits and nuts.|$|R
5000|$|The Rider style {{engine is}} an [...] "alpha" [...] engine which uses two {{separate}} cylinders. As {{air in the}} hot side cylinder <b>heats,</b> it <b>expands,</b> driving the piston upward. The crankshaft now moves the cold side piston upward, drawing the hot air over to the cold side. The air cools, contracts, and pulls the hot side piston downward. The cold side piston then pushes the cool air over to the hot side, and the cycle repeats.|$|R
60|$|These conclusions, however, {{must not}} be drawn without certain precautions. In the first place, the {{possibility}} of drawing them at all, manifestly supposes that we are acquainted {{not only with the}} variations, but with the absolute quantities both of A and a. If we do not know the total quantities, we can not, of course, determine the real numerical relation according to which those quantities vary. It is, therefore, an error to conclude, as some have concluded, that because increase of <b>heat</b> <b>expands</b> bodies, that is, increases the distance between their particles, therefore the distance is wholly the effect of heat, and that if we could entirely exhaust the body of its heat, the particles would be in complete contact. This {{is no more than a}} guess, and of the most hazardous sort, not a legitimate induction: for since we neither know how much heat there is in any body, nor what is the real distance between any two of its particles, we can not judge whether the contraction of the distance does or does not follow the diminution of the quantity of heat according to such a numerical relation that the two quantities would vanish simultaneously.|$|R
50|$|The caked layer {{that helps}} prevent burning through the bottom or {{sides of a}} briar wood pipe may damage other pipes, such as {{meerschaum}} or clay. As the cake layer <b>heats</b> up, it <b>expands</b> and may cause cracks or breaks in non-briar pipes.|$|R
50|$|To summarize, the Stirling engine {{uses the}} {{temperature}} difference between its hot end and cold end {{to establish a}} cycle of a fixed mass of gas, <b>heated</b> and <b>expanded,</b> and cooled and compressed, thus converting thermal energy into mechanical energy. The greater the temperature difference between the hot and cold sources, the greater the thermal efficiency. The maximum theoretical efficiency {{is equivalent to the}} Carnot cycle, however the efficiency of real engines is less than this value because of friction and other losses.|$|R
40|$|The microwave-plasma {{electrothermal}} rocket (MWPETR) shows {{promise for}} spacecraft propulsion and maneuvering, without {{some of the}} drawbacks of competitive electric propulsion systems. In the MWPETR, the electric power is first converted to microwave-frequency radiation. In a specially-designed microwave cavity system, the electromagnetic energy of the radiation is transferred to the electrons in a plasma sustained in the working fluid. The resulting high-energy electrons transfer their energy to the atoms and molecules of the working fluid by collisions. The working fluid, thus <b>heated,</b> <b>expands</b> through a nozzle to generate thrust. In the MWPETR, no electrodes are {{in contact with the}} working fluid, the energy is transferred into the working fluid by nonthermal mechanisms, and the main requirement for the materials of construction is that the walls of the plasma chamber be insulating and transparent to microwave radiation at operating conditions. In this survey of work on the MWPETR, several experimental configurations are described and compared. Diagnostic methods used in the study are described and compared, including titration, spectroscopy, calorimetry, electric field measurements, gas-dynamic methods, and thrust measurements. Measured and estimated performance efficiencies are reported. Results of computer modeling of the plasma and of the gas flowing from the plasma are summarized...|$|R
5000|$|When the ammonia in the {{refrigeration}} loop is compressed, {{energy is}} {{released in the}} form of heat. When the ammonia is allowed to <b>expand,</b> <b>heat</b> is absorbed from the brine loop. The cold brine (now at [...] to 20 °F) is circulated under the concrete rink floor.|$|R
25|$|As {{explained}} in the thermodynamics of gas storage section above, compressing air <b>heats</b> it and <b>expanding</b> it cools it. Therefore, practical air engines require heat exchangers {{in order to avoid}} excessively high or low temperatures and even so don't reach ideal constant temperature conditions, or ideal thermal insulation.|$|R
2500|$|Cupping (Chinese: 拔罐; pinyin: báguàn) {{is a type}} of Chinese massage, {{consisting}} of placing several glass [...] "cups" [...] (open spheres) on the body. A match is lit and placed inside the cup and then removed before placing the cup against the skin. As the air in the cup is <b>heated,</b> it <b>expands,</b> and after placing in the skin, cools, creating lower pressure inside the cup that allows the cup to stick to the skin via suction [...] When combined with massage oil, the cups can be slid around the back, offering [...] "reverse-pressure massage".|$|R
50|$|The heat {{exchanger}} was a shell assembly, {{consisting of a}} duct, bellows, flanges, and coils. It was mounted in the turbine exhaust duct between the oxidizer turbine discharge manifold and the thrust chamber. It <b>heated</b> and <b>expanded</b> helium gas {{for use in the}} third stage or converted LOX to gaseous oxygen for the second stage for maintaining vehicle oxidizer tank pressurization. During engine operation, either LOX was tapped off the oxidizer high-pressure duct or helium was provided from the vehicle stage and routed to the {{heat exchanger}} coils.|$|R
