5|$|Lefante {{is found}} {{wandering}} on a roadside, but {{appears to have}} been given an improperly-performed lobotomy. Another woman, Alice Brandt, is later kidnapped. She wakes up bound to a dentist's chair, with her kidnapper brandishing an ice pick and speaking in German. Mulder returns to Washington, D.C. to digitally analyze the photos and finds no evidence that they were doctored. By closely examining the photos, he finds the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> old man as well as the shadow of the kidnapper, who appears to be abnormally tall.|$|E
5|$|On November 3, 2016, Stars and Stripes {{reported}} that the 10th Combat Aviation Brigade will deploy 1,750 soldiers to eastern Europe in March 2017, in support of Operation Atlantic Resolve - as part of NATO efforts to reassure Eastern Europe in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> assertive Russia in response to Russian intervention in Ukraine in 2014. The brigade will arrive with approximately 60 aircraft, including CH-47 Chinooks, UH-60 Blackhawks and medevac helicopters, the brigade will be headquartered in Germany and the brigade’s units will be forward-based at locations in Latvia, Romania and Poland.|$|E
5|$|Orangutans {{were known}} to the native people of Sumatra and Borneo for millennia. While some {{communities}} hunted them for food and decoration, others placed taboos on such practices. In central Borneo, some traditional folk beliefs consider it bad luck {{to look in the}} <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> orangutan. Some folk tales involve orangutans mating with and kidnapping humans. There are even stories of hunters being seduced by female orangutans.|$|E

In set theory, the set <b>of</b> <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> polytope includes the polytope itself and the empty set where the empty set is for consistency given a [...] "dimension" [...] of −1. For any n-polytope (n-dimensional polytope), −1 ≤ k ≤ n.|$|R
5|$|The Government {{amended the}} bill to delay debate for six months. As expected, the bill then fell when the Dáil was {{dissolved}} in the intervening period for the 2007 general election. Deputy Howlin said that {{the real reason for}} the delay was that the Government did not want to enact this type of social legislation in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> election.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament {{gained more}} powers from {{successive}} treaties, namely through {{the extension of}} the ordinary legislative procedure (then called the codecision procedure), and in 1999, the Parliament forced the resignation of the Santer Commission. The Parliament had refused to approve the Community budget over allegations of fraud and mis-management in the Commission. The two main parties took on a government-opposition dynamic for the first time during the crisis which ended in the Commission resigning en masse, the first of any forced resignation, in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> impending censure from the Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{second son}} of King Ludwig I of Bavaria, Otto ascended {{the newly created}} throne of Greece while still a minor. His {{government}} was initially run by a three-man regency council made up of Bavarian court officials. Upon reaching his majority, Otto removed the regents when they proved unpopular with the people and he ruled as an absolute monarch. Eventually his subjects' demands for a Constitution proved overwhelming, and in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> armed but bloodless insurrection Otto in 1843 granted a constitution. However he rigged elections using fraud and terror.|$|E

5|$|Darling had {{a strong}} {{personality}} and an independent outlook. Those who knew him well thought him destined {{to be a leader}} in whatever he undertook. He shunned strong drink and tobacco and found it difficult to tolerate overindulgence in alcohol. Normally even-tempered, he did show displeasure at the heckling from the crowd at Lord's at his obstinate defensive effort in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Australian batting collapse. He was a stickler for fair play, but his actions against the English batsman KS Ranjitsinhji would today be seen as gamesmanship. During the bowler's approach and after the bowler had looked at the field, the Australian fielders moved behind Ranjitsinhji's back. This worried the Indian prince when playing his leg glance and eventually saw him left out of the English team.|$|E
5|$|Domnall Gerrlámhach (died 1135), {{also known}} as Domnall Gerrlámhach Ua Briain, Domnall mac Muirchertaig, and Domnall Ua Briain, was an obscure twelfth-century Uí Briain dynast and King of Dublin. He {{was one of two}} sons of Muirchertach Ua Briain, High King of Ireland. Domnall's father appears to have {{installed}} him as King of Dublin in the late eleventh- or early twelfth century, which suggests that he was his father's successor-designate. Although Domnall won a remarkable victory in the defence of the Kingdom of Dublin in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> invasion from the Kingdom of Leinster in 1115, he failed to achieve the successes of his father. After his final expulsion from Dublin at hands of Toirdelbach Ua Conchobair, King of Connacht, and the death of his father, Domnall disappears from record until his own death in 1135. He was perhaps survived by two sons.|$|E
5|$|Temes was {{commissioned}} into the Danube Flotilla in 1915, {{and was in}} action against the Serbian Army at Belgrade in early October, when the Serbs evacuated {{the city in the}} <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Austro-Hungarian assault. During the final river crossing and reinforcement of the resulting bridgehead, Temes provided close support. During this task, she attempted to draw fire away from the battle-damaged monitor Enns but after receiving a direct hit in the crew quarters aft, she had to move out of range. She was run ashore to put out fires and stop leaks, before being towed out of the battle area by an armed steamer, and taken to Budapest for repairs.|$|E
50|$|The model made {{of three}} units {{results in a}} {{triangular}} bipyramid. Building a pyramid on each <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> regular tetrahedron, using six units, results in a cube (the central fold of each module lays flat, creating square <b>faces</b> instead <b>of</b> isosceles right triangular faces, and changing the formula for the number <b>of</b> <b>faces,</b> edges, and vertices), or triakis tetrahedron. Building a pyramid on each <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> regular octahedron, using twelve Sonobe units, results in a triakis octahedron. Building a pyramid on each <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> regular icosahedron requires 30 units, and results in a triakis icosahedron. Uniform polyhedra {{can be adapted to}} Sonobe modules by replacing non-triangular faces with pyramids having equilateral faces; for example by adding pentagonal pyramids pointing inwards to the <b>faces</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dodecahedron a 90-module ball can be obtained.|$|R

5|$|The Austro-Hungarian base at Zemun {{was briefly}} {{evacuated}} {{due to a}} Serbian counterattack in September. On 28 September, Körös, along with the monitor , a patrol boat and a minesweeper, broke through the minefields on the Sava near Belgrade and pushed upstream to join the fighting near Šabac. In November, French artillery support arrived in Belgrade, endangering the monitor's anchorage. The stalemate continued until December 1914 when the Serbs briefly evacuated Belgrade in the <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> Austro-Hungarian assault, although Körös did not support this action. After less than two weeks, the Austro-Hungarians had to withdraw from Belgrade, and it was soon recaptured by the Serbs with Russian and French assistance. Körös continued in action against Serbia and her allies at Belgrade until December, when {{the base of the}} Danube Flotilla was withdrawn north to Petrovaradin for the winter.|$|E

25|$|Eddies are formed, like hydraulics, on the {{downstream}} <b>face</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> obstruction. Unlike hydraulics, eddies swirl on {{the horizontal}} {{surface of the}} water.

However, in very powerful water, eddies can have powerful, swirling currents which can flip boats and from which escape can be very difficult.|$|E
