5|$|Once a neuron is in place, {{it extends}} {{dendrites}} and an axon {{into the area}} around it. Axons, because they commonly extend a great distance from the cell body and need to reach specific targets, grow in a particularly complex way. The tip of a growing axon consists of a blob of protoplasm called a <b>growth</b> <b>cone,</b> studded with chemical receptors. These receptors sense the local environment, causing the <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> to be attracted or repelled by various cellular elements, and thus to be pulled in a particular direction at each point along its path. The result of this pathfinding process is that the <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> navigates through the brain until it reaches its destination area, where other chemical cues cause it to begin generating synapses. Considering the entire brain, thousands of genes create products that influence axonal pathfinding.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{molecular}} cues involved in the correct targeting of the migrating precursors remains a question. The secretion of a chemoattractant factor by the OB appears as a possibility. Chemoattractants and repellants act on the migrating neurons by inducing changes in the <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> to direct them. Nevertheless, tissue derived from this structure had no directive influence on the migration. On the other hand, a septum-derived secreted factor showed a repulsive effect on the SVZ cells. More recently, {{it has been shown}} that the secreted molecule SLIT shows such a repelling effect on SVZ-derived precursors. Furthermore, integrins have been demonstrated to have a regulatory influence on precursor cell chain-migration and regulation of their divisions.|$|E
25|$|There {{are also}} many cytoskeletal-associated proteins, which perform {{a variety of}} duties within the <b>growth</b> <b>cone,</b> such as {{anchoring}} actin and microtubules to each other, to the membrane, and to other cytoskeletal components. Some of these components include molecular motors that generate force within the <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> and membrane-bound vesicles which are transported {{in and out of}} the <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> via microtubules. Some examples of cytoskeletal-associated proteins are Fascin and Filamin (actin bundling), Talin (actin anchoring), myosin (vesicle transport), and mDia (microtubule-actin linking).|$|E
40|$|The early {{zebrafish}} brain {{contains a}} simple axon scaffold of longitudinal tracts connected by commissures. Neurons in {{the nucleus of}} the posterior commissure (nuc PC) project <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> along a specific route in this axonal scaffold, raising the possibility that specific axons in the early scaffold guide nuc PC <b>growth</b> <b>cones.</b> We tested this possibility by analyzing the behavior of nuc PC <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> in embryos in which a portion of the scaffold, normally traversed by nuc PC <b>growth</b> <b>cones,</b> was surgically prevented from forming. Under these conditions nuc PC <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> extended along both normal and aberrant pathways. This suggests that specific axons do provide guidance cues, since their removal leads to errors However, these cues are not obligatory, since some <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> still followed normal pathways...|$|R
40|$|Neurons of {{the nucleus}} of the {{posterior}} commissure (nuc PC), an identifiable cluster of neurons in the embryonic zebrafish brain, project <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> ventrally along the posterior commissure to the anterior tegmentum where the PC intersects two longitudinal tracts, the tract of the postoptic commissure (TPOC) and the medial longitu-dinal fasciculus (MLF). Once at the intersection, nuc PC <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> turn posteriorly onto the TPOC in the dorsal tegmentum and follow it to the hindbrain. Previ-ously we showed that {{in the absence of the}} TPOC, nuc P C <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> often extended along aberrant path-ways suggesting that fasciculation, that is, contact with TPOC axons is an important factor in guiding <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> along their normal pathway. However, a signifi-cant number of nuc P C <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> also followed their normal pathway suggesting that cues associated with the dorsolateral tegmentum, independent of the TPOC, can also guide nuc PC <b>growth</b> <b>cones.</b> We have now confirmed using electron microscopy that nuc PC <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> fa-sciculate with axons in the TPOC. In the absence of the TPOC, the nuc P C <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> that extend along their normal pathway do so in contact with dorsolateral neuro-epithelial cells. This suggests that cues associated with these cells can also guide the nuc PC <b>growth</b> <b>cones.</b> Fur-thermore, in the absence of the TPOC axons, these <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> now inappropriately turn onto axons that normally intersect the TPOC near the border of the mid-brain and hindbrain, that is, a t a second intersection of tracts. This suggests that fasciculation with TPOC axons may also guide nuc P C <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> in this second regio...|$|R
40|$|Navigating <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> need to integrate, {{process and}} respond to {{guidance}} signals, requiring dynamic information transfer within and between different compartments. Studies have shown that, faced with different navigation challenges, <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> display dynamic changes in growth kinetics and morphologies. However, it remains unknown whether these are paralleled by differences in their internal molecular dynamics. To examine whether there are protein mobility differences during guidance, we developed multiphoton fluorescence recovery after photobleaching methods to determine molecular diffusion rates in pathfinding <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> in vivo. Actively navigating <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> (leaders) have consistently longer recovery times than <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> that are fasciculated and less actively navigating (followers). Pharmacological perturbations of the cytoskeleton point to actin as the primary modulator of diffusion in differently behaving <b>growth</b> <b>cones.</b> This approach provides a powerful means to quantify mobility of specific proteins in neurons in vivo and reveals that diffusion is important during axon navigation...|$|R
25|$|As {{the nervous}} system develops, the {{patterning}} of neuronal connections is established by molecular guides that direct axons (axon guidance) along pathways by target and pathway derived signals. Eph/ephrin signaling regulates the migration of axons to their target destinations largely by decreasing the survival of axonal growth cones and repelling the migrating axon away {{from the site of}} Eph/ephrin activation. This mechanism of repelling migrating axons through decreased <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> survival depends on relative levels of Eph and ephrin expression and allows gradients of Eph and ephrin expression in target cells to direct the migration of axon growth cones based on their own relative levels of Eph and ephrin expression. Typically, forward signaling by both EphA and EphB receptors mediates <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> collapse while reverse signaling via ephrin-A and ephrin-B induces <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> survival.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} {{to the formation of}} topographic maps, Eph/ephrin signaling has been implicated in the proper guidance of motor neuron axons in the spinal cord. Although several members of Ephs and ephrins contribute to motor neuron guidance, ephrin-A5 reverse signaling has been shown to {{play a critical role in}} the survival of motor neuron growth cones and to mediate <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> migration by initiating repellence in EphA-expressing migrating axons.|$|E
25|$|In vertebrates, {{landmarks}} {{of embryonic}} neural development include the birth and {{differentiation of neurons}} from stem cell precursors, the migration of immature neurons from their birthplaces in the embryo to their final positions, outgrowth of axons from neurons and guidance of the motile <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> through the embryo towards postsynaptic partners, the generation of synapses between these axons and their postsynaptic partners, and finally the lifelong changes in synapses which are thought to underlie learning and memory.|$|E
40|$|Neuronal <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> {{are highly}} motile {{structures}} that tip developing neurites and explore their surroundings before axo-dendritic contact and synaptogenesis. However, the membrane proteins organizing these processes remain insufficiently understood. Here we identify that the synaptic {{cell adhesion molecule}} 1 (SynCAM 1), an immunoglobulin superfamily member, is already expressed in developing neurons and localizes to their <b>growth</b> <b>cones.</b> Upon interaction of <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> with target neurites, SynCAM 1 rapidly assembles at these contacts to form stable adhesive clusters. Synaptic markers can also be detected at these sites. Addressing the functions of SynCAM 1 in <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> preceding contact, we determine that it is required and sufficient to restrict the number of active filopodia. Further, SynCAM 1 negatively regulates the morphological complexity of migrating <b>growth</b> <b>cones.</b> Focal adhesion kinase, a binding partner of SynCAM 1, is implicated in its morphogenetic activities. These results reveal that SynCAM 1 acts in developing neurons to shape migrating <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> and contributes to the adhesive differentiation of their axo-dendritic contacts...|$|R
40|$|The {{scanning}} {{electron microscope}} {{was used to examine}} the <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> of sensory neurites on the basal lamina of the trunk skin and on the myotomes in dissected embryos of the amphibian, Xenopus laevis. On the myotomes <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> are large and flat with extensive lamellipodia and many filopodia. On the skin <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> are smaller and have simpler processes particularly in more ventral positions. Where <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> contact each other or other neurites they are very intimately apposed and show many indications of strong mutual adhesion. Fasciculation and separation of growing neurites is described and the conditions leading to fasciculation are considered. Measurements of <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> on the myotomes and different dorsoventral regions of the skin are interpreted in terms of possible differences in the adhesiveness of these substrates. We conclude that many of our observations can be explained by differences in substrate adhesion to the <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> but that the skin may have some special, unknown attraction for them...|$|R
40|$|The {{transport}} of mRNAs into developing dendrites and axons {{may be a}} basic mechanism to localize cytoskeletal proteins to <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> and influence microfilament organization. Using isoform-specific antibodies and probes for in situ hybridization, we observed distinct localization patterns for beta- and gamma-actin within cultured cerebrocortical neurons. beta-Actin protein was highly enriched within <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> and filopodia, in contrast to gamma-actin protein, which was distributed uniformly throughout the cell. beta-Actin protein also was shown to be peripherally localized after transfection of beta-actin cDNA bearing an epitope tag. beta-Actin mRNAs were localized more frequently to neuronal processes and <b>growth</b> <b>cones,</b> unlike gamma-actin mRNAs, which were restricted to the cell body. The rapid localization of beta-actin mRNA, but not gamma-actin mRNA, into processes and <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> could be induced by dibutyryl cAMP treatment. Using high-resolution in situ hybridization and image-processing methods, we showed that the distribution of beta-actin mRNA within <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> was statistically nonrandom and demonstrated an association with microtubules. beta-Actin mRNAs were detected within minor neurites, axonal processes, and <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> {{in the form of}} spatially distinct granules that colocalized with translational components. Ultrastructural analysis revealed polyribosomes within <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> that colocalized with cytoskeletal filaments. The {{transport of}} beta-actin mRNA into developing neurites may be a sequence-specific mechanism to synthesize cytoskeletal proteins directly within processes and <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> and would provide an additional means to deliver cytoskeletal proteins over long distances...|$|R
25|$|<b>Growth</b> <b>cone</b> receptors {{detect the}} {{presence}} of axon guidance molecules such as Netrin, Slit, Ephrins, and Semaphorins. It has more recently been shown that cell fate determinants such as Wnt or Shh can also act as guidance cues. Quite interestingly, the same guidance cue can act as an attractant or a repellent, depending on context. A prime {{example of this is}} Netrin-1, which signals attraction through the DCC receptor and repulsion through the Unc-5 receptor. Furthermore, it has been discovered that these same molecules are involved in guiding vessel growth. Axon guidance directs the initial wiring of the nervous system and is also important in axonal regeneration following an injury.|$|E
25|$|Mature axon tracts {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to experience growth when mechanically stretched at the central portion of the axon cylinder. Such mechanical stretch was applied by a custom axon stretch-growth bioreactor composed of four main components: custom-designed axon expansion chamber, linear motion table, stepper motor and controller. The nerve tissue culture is placed within the expansion chamber with a port for gas exchange and a removable stretching frame, which is able to separate two groups of somas (neuron cell bodies) and thus stretch their axons. Collagen gel was used to promote the growth of larger stretch-grown axon tracts that were visible to the unaided eye. There are two reasons for the growth enhancement due to the collagen coating: 1) the culture became hydrophobic after the collagen dried, which permitted a denser concentration of neurons to grow, and 2) the collagen coating created an unobstructed coating across the two elongation substrates. Examination by scanning electron microscope and TEM {{showed no signs of}} axon thinning due to stretch, and the cytoskeleton appeared to be normal and intact. The stretch-grown axon tracts were cultured on a biocompatible membrane, which could be directly formed into a cylindrical structure for transplantation, eliminating the need to transfer axons to a scaffold after growth was complete. The stretch-grown axons were able to grow at an unprecedented rate of 1cm/day after only 8 days of acclimation, which is much greater than the 1mm/day maximal growth rate as measured for <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> extension. The rate of 1mm/day is also the average transport speed for structural elements such as neurofilaments.|$|E
500|$|KIF11 (also {{known as}} kinesin-5 and Eg5) is a homotetramer which cross-links anti-parallel microtubules in the mitotic spindle to {{maintain}} spindle bipolarity.

[...] Kinesin-5 motors assemble into a bipolar homotetrameric structure {{that is capable of}} sliding apart bundles of anti-parallel oriented microtubules. This motor is essential for mitosis in most organisms, wherein it participates in the self-assembly of the microtubule-based mitotic spindle, but is not otherwise required for cell viability.

40|$|Wiring up {{the nervous}} system depends on the precise {{guidance}} of axonal <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> to their targets. A key mechanism underlying this guidance is chemotaxis, whereby <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> detect and follow molecular gradients. Although recent work has uncovered many of the molecules involved in this process, the mechanisms underlying chemotactic axon guidance are still unclear. Here we compare <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> with neutrophils and Dictyostelium discoideum, systems for which a clear conceptual framework for chemotaxis has recently emerged.

40|$|We {{have used}} video {{time-lapse}} microscopy to analyze in vitro {{the interactions of}} <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> of newborn rat dorsal root ganglion cells with dissociated young rat CNS glial cells present in the cultures at low density. To provide optimal conditions for neurite extension, cells were grown on laminin and in NGF-supplemented medium. Our initial observations showed that there are 2 subpopulations of <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> differing in their growth rate on laminin (averages of 12 and 45 rm/hr).

2500|$|A similar {{process is}} {{involved}} with microtubules. [...] In {{the presence of an}} attractive cue {{on one side of the}} <b>growth</b> <b>cone,</b> specific microtubules are targeted on that side by microtubule stabilizing proteins, resulting in <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> turning in the direction of the positive stimulus. With repulsive cues, the opposite is true: microtubule stabilization is favored on the opposite side of the <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> as the negative stimulus resulting in the <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> turning away from the repellent. [...] This process coupled with actin-associated processes result in the overall directed growth of an axon.|$|E
2500|$|The highly dynamic {{nature of}} growth cones {{allows them to}} respond to the {{surrounding}} environment by rapidly changing direction and branching in response to various stimuli. There are three stages of axon outgrowth, which are termed: protrusion, engorgement, and consolidation. [...] During protrusion, there is a rapid extension of filopodia and lamellar extensions along {{the leading edge of the}} <b>growth</b> <b>cone.</b> [...] Engorgement follows when the filopodia move to the lateral edges of the <b>growth</b> <b>cone,</b> and microtubules invade further into the <b>growth</b> <b>cone,</b> bringing vesicles and organelles such as mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum. [...] Finally, consolidation occurs when the F-actin at the neck of the <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> depolymerizes and the filopodia retract. [...] The membrane then shrinks to form a cylindrical axon shaft around the bundle of microtubules. [...] One form of axon branching also occurs via the same process, except that the <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> “splits” during the engorgement phase. This results in the bifurcation of the main axon. An additional form of axon branching is termed collateral (or interstitial) branching;.Collateral branching, unlike axon bifurcations, involves the formation of a new branch from the established axon shaft and is independent of the <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> at the tip of the growing axon. In this mechanism, the axon initially generates a filopodium or lamellipodium which following invasion by axonal microtubules can then develop further into a branch extending perpendicular from the axon shaft. Established collateral branches, like the main axon, exhibit a <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> and develop independently of the main axon tip.|$|E
2500|$|The growth {{capacity}} of the axons lies in the microtubules which are located just beyond the actin filaments. Microtubules can rapidly polymerize into and thus “probe” the actin-rich peripheral region of the <b>growth</b> <b>cone.</b> [...] When this happens, the polymerizing ends of microtubules {{come into contact with}} F-actin adhesion sites, where microtubule tip-associated proteins act as [...] "ligands". Laminins of the basal membrane interact with the integrins of the <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> to promote the forward movement of the <b>growth</b> <b>cone.</b> Additionally, axon outgrowth is also supported by the stabilization of the proximal ends of microtubules, which provide the structural support for the axon.|$|E
40|$|The {{spinal cord}} of early {{zebrafish}} embryos contains {{a small number}} of neurons per hemisegment. The earliest neurons are identifiable as individual neurons or small groups of homogeneous neurons and project <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> that follow stereotyped, cell-specific pathways to their targets. These <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> appear to bypass some axons but follow others during pathfinding, suggesting that they can distinguish among the different axons they normally encounter. Furthermore, identified <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> exhibit cell-specific behaviors in apparent contact with the floor plate cells, which are found at the ventral midline of the early cord. These observations suggest the testable hypothesis that the floor plate may mediate multiple, cell-specific actions on identified <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> in the zebrafish cord. One hypothesized action is inhibition of specific <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> to prevent them from crossing the ventral midline...|$|R
50|$|Retinal <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> {{were thought}} to be related to {{follower}} neurons. However, studies in zebrafish have revealed that these <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> followed a pretract morphologically different from its surroundings and extending out in front of regular pioneer neurons. This seems to imply a pioneer nature, masked by their location, and it is possible that other “cryptic” pioneer <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> and pretracts may be common across the nervous system, confused by a follower origin.|$|R
40|$|The role of {{specific}} axonal tracts for {{the guidance of}} <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> was investigated by examining axonal outgrowth within the abnormal brain tracts of zebrafish cyclops mutants. Normally, the earliest differentiating neurons in the zebrafish brain establish a simple scaffold of axonal tracts. Later-developing axons follow cell-specific pathways within this axonal scaffold. In Cyclops embryos, this scaffold is perturbed due to the deletion of some ventromedial neurons that establish parts of the axonal scaffold {{and the development of}} an abnormal crease in the brain. In these mutant embryos, the <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> projected by the neurons of the nucleus of the posterior commissure (nur PC) are deprived of the two tracts of axons that they sequentially follow to first extend ventrally, then posteriorly. These <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> respond to the abnormal scaffold in several interesting ways. First, nuc PC <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> initially always extend ventrally as in wild-type embryos. This suggests that for the first portion of their pathway the axons they normally follow are not required for proper navigation. Second, approximately half of the nuc PC <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> follow aberrant longitudinal pathways after the first portion of their pathway. This suggests that for the longitudinal portion of the pathway, specific growth cone/axon interactions are important for guiding <b>growth</b> <b>cones.</b> Third, although approximately half of the nuc PC <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> follow aberrant longitudinal pathways, the rest follow normal pathways despite the absence of the axons that they normally follow. This suggests that cues independent of these axons may be capable of guiding nuc PC <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> as well. These results suggest that different guidance cues or combinations of cues guide specific <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> along different portions of their pathway. 1994 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R
2500|$|The {{morphology}} of the <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> can {{be easily}} described by using the hand as an analogy.

Filopodia are the dominant structures in growth cones, and they appear as narrow cylindrical extensions which can extend several micrometres beyond {{the edge of the}} <b>growth</b> <b>cone.</b> The filopodia are bound by membrane which contains receptors and cell adhesion molecules that are important for axon growth and guidance.|$|E
2500|$|Overall, axon {{elongation}} is {{the product}} of a process known as tip growth. [...] In this process, new material is added at the <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> while the remainder of the axonal cytoskeleton remains stationary. [...] This occurs via two processes: cytoskeletal-based dynamics and mechanical tension. [...] With cytoskeletal dynamics, microtubules polymerize into the <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> and deliver vital components. [...] Mechanical tension occurs when the membrane is stretched due to force generation by molecular motors in the <b>growth</b> <b>cone</b> and strong adhesions to the substrate along the axon.

Fluorescent in situ hybridization also showed that miR- 134 is enriched in the <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> of Xenopus spinal neurons in culture. Importantly, overexpression of miR- 134 mimics or antisense inhibitors blocked protein synthesis (PS) -dependent attractive responses of Xenopus <b>growth</b> <b>cones</b> to a gradient of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF).
