40|$|The last {{decades the}} concern of the public, {{regarding}} the possible affects from the exposure to magnetic and electric fields, has grown considerably. This is because the generation, transmission and distribution of electric power are accompanied {{with the presence of}} the above mentioned fields. This paper attempts to illustrate the values of the resultant magnetic field in the low frequency range, near a compact <b>kiosk</b> type <b>substation</b> 630 KVA, 20 - 0. 4 kV. The measurements were performed in a park, in the city center of Chania, Greece, during summer time. All measured magnetic field values were lower in comparison to the value of 100 μT introduced by ICNIRP. © 2010 IEEE...|$|R
