5|$|Despite injury troubles, Totti {{recovered}} {{in time to}} join the national team for their victorious 2006 World Cup campaign, {{despite a lack of}} match practice during his three months on the sidelines. Italy manager Marcello Lippi showed enormous faith in Totti, assuring him during his rehabilitation that his spot in Italy's World Cup squad was secure and to focus on recuperating. This encouragement and show of faith fueled Totti's desire to work even harder to overcome {{what could have been a}} career-ending injury and make <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>World</b> Cup against all odds (and much of the Italian media's opinion).|$|E
