2500|$|The philosopher {{of science}} Elliott Sober once argued {{along the same}} lines as Popper, tying {{simplicity}} with [...] "informativeness": The simplest theory is the more informative, {{in the sense that it}} requires less information to a question. He has since rejected this account of simplicity, purportedly because it fails to provide an epistemic justification for simplicity. He now believes that simplicity considerations (and considerations of parsimony in particular) do not count unless they reflect something more fundamental. Philosophers, he suggests, may have made the error of hypostatizing simplicity (i.e., endowed it with a sui generis existence), when it has meaning only when embedded in a specific context (Sober 1992). <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>fail</b> to justify simplicity considerations on the basis of the context in which we use them, we may have no non-circular justification: [...] "Just as the question 'why be rational?' may have no non-circular answer, the same may be true of the question 'why should simplicity be considered in evaluating the plausibility of hypotheses?'" ...|$|E

2500|$|On 2 June 1935, Ribbentrop {{arrived in}} London. The talks began on Tuesday, 4 June 1935, at the Admiralty office with Ribbentrop heading the German {{delegation}} and Simon the British delegation. Ribbentrop, who {{was determined to}} succeed at his mission, no matter what, began his talks by stating the British could either accept the 35:100 ratio as [...] "fixed and unalterable" [...] by the weekend, or the German delegation would go home, and the Germans would build their navy up to any size they wished. Simon was visibly angry with Ribbentrop's behaviour: [...] "It is not usual to make such conditions {{at the beginning of}} negotiations". Simon walked out of the talks. On 5 June 1935, a change of opinion came over the British delegation. In a report to the British Cabinet, it was [...] "definitely of the opinion that, in our own interest, we should accept this offer of Herr Hitler's while it is still open.... If we now refuse to accept the offer for the purposes of these discussions, Herr Hitler will withdraw the offer and Germany will seek to build to a higher level than 35 per cent.... Having regard to past history and to Germany's known capacity to become a serious naval rival of this country, we may have cause to regret it <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>fail</b> to take this chance...". Also, on 5 June, during talks between Sir Robert Craigie, the British Foreign Office's naval expert and chief of the Foreign Office's American Department and Ribbentrop's deputy, Admiral Karl-Georg Schuster, the Germans conceded that the 35:100 ratio would take the form of tonnage ratios, and the Germans would more or less build their tonnage up to whatever the British tonnage was in various warship categories. On the afternoon of that same day, the British Cabinet voted to accept the 35:100 ratio, and Ribbentrop was informed of the Cabinet's acceptance in the evening.|$|E
