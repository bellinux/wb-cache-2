Evidence that a vampire was active in a given locality included death of cattle, sheep, relatives or neighbours.

5|$|The {{film is a}} {{depiction}} of various scenes, usually violent or bizarre, that somehow relate to hunting. Each scenario is presented {{one after the other}} with little regard for narrative continuity. The opening scene introduces a Patagonian hunter who hunts stags to survive. The opening credits play over as he chases after a stag, which he ultimately shoots, kills, and beheads. Afterwards, one of the numerous scenes of anti-hunting gatherings is shown, this one in Cape Cod. The attention quickly shifts to wildlife hunting, where a monkey is killed by a leopard, and then a squirrel monkey by an anaconda. The theme changes again to the social hunt of wild game in Australia and Africa. Aborigines hunt kangaroos and other large marsupials with spears and giant bats with boomerangs. Indigenous tribes of Africa hunt large game, including antelope, buffalo, and elephants, in the savanna. Religious ceremonies are also shown, where the African hunters proceed to suck <b>fresh</b> <b>blood</b> from the entrails of an antelope, and the Australian aborigines symbolically bury their prey in dust to placate the spirits of the animals. Lastly, two brothers are arrested after partaking in a form of ritual post-mortem cannibalism of three of their relatives to acquire the hunting skills of the dead.|$|E

40|$|Background: Thoracic trauma {{occurred}} in 10 % {{of the patients}} seen at US military treatment facilities in Iraq and Afghanistan and 52 % of those patients were transfused. Among those transfused, 281 patients received warm <b>fresh</b> whole <b>blood.</b> A previous report documented improved survival with warm <b>fresh</b> whole <b>blood</b> in patients injured in combat without stratification by injury pattern. A later report described an increase in acute lung injuries after its administration. Survivorship and warm <b>fresh</b> whole <b>blood</b> have never been analyzed in a subpopulation at highest risk for lung injuries, such as patients with thoracic trauma. There may be a heterogeneous relationship between whole blood and survival based on likelihood of a concomitant pulmonary injury. In this report, the relationship between warm <b>fresh</b> whole <b>blood</b> and survivorship was analyzed among patients at highest risk for concomitant pulmonary injuries. Materials and Methods: Patients with thoracic trauma who received a transfusion were identified in the Joint Theater Trauma Registry. Gross mortality rates were compared between whole blood recipients and patients transfused with component therapy only. The association between each blood component and mortality was determined in a regression model. The overall mortality risk was compared between warm <b>fresh</b> whole <b>blood</b> recipients and non-recipients. Results: Patients transfused with warm <b>fresh</b> whole <b>blood</b> in addition to component therapy had a higher mortality rate than patients transfused only separated blood components (21. 3 % vs. 12. 8 %, P < 0. 001). When controlling for covariates, transfusion of warm <b>fresh</b> whole <b>blood</b> in addition to component therapy {{was not associated with}} increased mortality risk compared with the transfusion of component therapy only (OR 1. 247 [95 % CI 0. 760 - 2. 048], P = 0. 382). Conclusion: Patients with combat related thoracic trauma transfused with warm <b>fresh</b> whole <b>blood</b> were not at increased risk for mortality compared to those who received component therapy alone when controlling for covariates...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThis study {{compared}} {{the effects of}} reconstituted <b>fresh</b> whole <b>blood</b> against standard blood component therapy in neonates undergoing cardiac surgery. MethodsPatients less than 1 month of age were randomized to receive either reconstituted <b>fresh</b> whole <b>blood</b> (n = 31) or standard blood component therapy (n = 33) to prime the bypass circuit and for transfusion during the 24 hours after cardiopulmonary bypass. Primary outcome was chest tube drainage; secondary outcomes included transfusion needs, inotrope score, ventilation time, and hospital length of stay. ResultsPatients who received reconstituted <b>fresh</b> whole <b>blood</b> had significantly less postoperative chest tube volume loss per kilogram of body weight (7. 7 mL/kg vs 11. 8 mL/kg; P =. 03). Standard blood component therapy was associated with higher inotropic score (6. 6 vs 3. 3; P =. 002), longer ventilation times (164 hours vs 119 hours; P =. 04), as well as longer hospital stays (18 days vs 12 days; P =. 006) than patients receiving reconstituted <b>fresh</b> whole <b>blood.</b> Of the different factors {{associated with the use}} of reconstituted <b>fresh</b> whole <b>blood,</b> lower platelet counts at 10 minutes and at the end of cardiopulmonary bypass, older age of cells used in the prime and throughout bypass, and exposures to higher number of allogeneic donors were found to be independent predictors of poor clinical outcomes. ConclusionsReconstituted <b>fresh</b> whole <b>blood</b> used for the prime, throughout cardiopulmonary bypass, and for all transfusion requirements within the first 24 hours postoperatively results in reduced chest tube volume loss and improved clinical outcomes in neonatal patients undergoing cardiac surgery...|$|R

25|$|The {{vascular}} arterial system supplying <b>fresh</b> <b>blood</b> branches {{into smaller}} and smaller vessels as it enters the brain surface and within-brain regions, culminating in a connected capillary bed within the brain. The drainage system, similarly, merges into larger and larger veins as it carries away oxygen-depleted blood. The dHb contribution to the fMRI signal is from both the capillaries near the area of activity and larger draining veins that may be farther away. For good spatial resolution, the signal from the large veins needs to be suppressed, since it does not correspond to {{the area where the}} neural activity is. This can be achieved either by using strong static magnetic fields or by using spin-echo pulse sequences. With these, fMRI can examine a spatial range from millimeters to centimeters, and can hence identify Brodmann areas (centimers), subcortical nuclei such as the caudate, putamen and thalamus, and hippocampal subfields such as the combined dentate gyrus/CA3, CA1, and subiculum.|$|E

25|$|Some of the brachyceran flies are {{important}} transmitters of pathogenic organisms through a route known as mechanical (or contaminative) transmission. These flies have complex cutting mouthparts {{that make a}} superficial wound in skin. Blood flowing into the wound is sponged up by the labella organ of the mouthparts (see photograph of Tabanus mouthparts). The flies tend to take small meals from many hosts at short intervals, to avoid the defensive actions of their hosts. <b>Fresh</b> <b>blood</b> on the labella may contaminate other hosts with pathogenic organisms. Many species of brachyceran flies such as the house-flies and blow-flies that do not feed on blood are also mechanical transmitters of pathogenic organisms by a contaminative route on their mouthparts used for sponging up wet nutritious secretions on skin of vertebrate animals. Usually the mechanical transmission of microbes by flies does not involve any developmental stage of the microorganism in the fly. However, some brachyceran flies, such {{as a group of}} species of Glossina genus {{are important}} biological transmitters, not mechanical.|$|E
