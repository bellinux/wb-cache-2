5|$|Historians {{have to make}} {{considerable}} assumptions {{trying to}} reconstruct the full family tree because of extremely scarce written sources about {{the early history of}} Lithuania. The matter is further complicated by the 16–17th century genealogies, most famously the Bychowiec Chronicle, that mixed legends and facts into one. The legends about Palemonids, a noble family from the Roman Empire who settled in Lithuania and gave rise to the Duchy, are quite popular and widespread in these genealogies. The real <b>historical</b> <b>data</b> comes from the Russian and Livonian chronicles, most important of these being the Hypatian Codex.|$|E
5|$|<b>Historical</b> <b>data</b> {{prior to}} 1700 is sparse {{due to lack}} of {{significant}} European settlements along the coastline; the few storms listed are largely records from Roanoke Colony and later the Province of Carolina. Modern meteorologists believe early storms were tropical cyclones, though due to the time period confirmation is impossible. One theory explaining the disappearance of Roanoke Colony suggests a hurricane destroyed the village, though {{there is no evidence to}} prove the theory. It is considered unlikely {{due to lack of}} damage to a fence around the village, on which the villagers left an inscription.|$|E

40|$|This article {{addresses}} {{several issues}} related to <b>historical</b> GIS <b>data</b> using a project studying the social culture of Republican Beijing as an illustration. For large-scale historical GIS projects, certain data layers or themes are fundamental to and provide the context for various types of investigation. We suggested that these data may be regarded as framework data, similar {{to the concept of}} the core dataset identified in the US National Spatial Data Infrastructure (NSDI) framework, but in a GIS project context. Due to various reasons, most <b>historical</b> GIS <b>data</b> always invite concerns about their quality. We discussed how typical spatial data quality concepts are partially applicable to <b>historical</b> GIS <b>data.</b> We also highlighted the data quality aspects that are more significant to historical than contemporary GIS <b>data.</b> Compiling high-quality <b>historical</b> GIS <b>data</b> is challenging. We used the data layer of temple locations as an example to illustrate the process of using a set of principles to resolve the inconsistencies of data from multiple sources to deal with location accuracy and data completeness problems. Two common but related quality concerns of <b>historical</b> GIS <b>data</b> are their relatively low spatial resolution and imprecise locations. The original population dataset of Republican Beijing suffers from these two issues. Using ancillary data, more precise population locations and population distribution at a higher resolution were estimated. Compilation of <b>historical</b> GIS <b>data</b> requires fusing data of different sources in order to enhance the quality of the data. © 2012 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

5|$|The {{approach}} in the New World, where anthropologists began to consider more fully the role of astronomy in Amerindian civilizations, was markedly different. They had access to sources that the prehistory of Europe lacks such as ethnographies and the historical records of the early colonizers. Following the pioneering example of Anthony Aveni, this allowed New World archaeoastronomers to make claims for motives which in the Old World would have been mere speculation. The concentration on <b>historical</b> <b>data</b> led to some claims of high accuracy that were comparatively weak {{when compared to the}} statistically led investigations in Europe.|$|E
5|$|The final {{storm was}} last noted on October17. These dates {{fall within the}} period with the most {{tropical}} cyclone activity in the Atlantic. Only two tropical cyclones during the season existed simultaneously. The hurricane brought heavy rainfall to Jamaica, resulting in eight deaths. This storm also left damage to crops and vessels in portions of the Bahamas and Cuba. Because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s, <b>historical</b> <b>data</b> on tropical cyclones from this period may not be comprehensive. An undercount bias of zero to six tropical cyclones per year between 1851 and 1885 has been estimated.|$|E

5|$|The 1933 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the second}} most active Atlantic {{hurricane season}} on record, with 20storms forming in the northwest Atlantic Ocean, breaking the record set by 1887. The season ran through the summer and {{the first half of}} fall in 1933, with activity as early as May and as late as November. A tropical cyclone was active for all but 13days from June 28 to October 7. The year was surpassed in total number of tropical cyclones by the 2005 season, which broke the record with 28storms. Tropical cyclones that did not approach populated areas or shipping lanes, especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration, may have remained undetected. Because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s, <b>historical</b> <b>data</b> on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable. Compensating for the lack of comprehensive observation, one hurricane researcher estimates the season could have produced 24tropical cyclones.|$|E
5|$|The 1940 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season was a generally average period of tropical cyclogenesis in 1940. Though the season had no official bounds, most tropical cyclone activity occurred during August and September. Throughout the year, fourteen tropical cyclones formed, of which nine reached tropical storm intensity; six were hurricanes. None of the hurricanes reached major hurricane intensity. Tropical cyclones {{that did not}} approach populated areas or shipping lanes, especially if they were relatively weak and of short duration, may have remained undetected. Because technologies such as satellite monitoring were not available until the 1960s, <b>historical</b> <b>data</b> on tropical cyclones from this period are often not reliable. As {{a result of a}} reanalysis project which analyzed the season in 2012, an additional hurricane was added to HURDAT. The year's first tropical storm formed on May19 off the northern coast of Hispaniola. At the time, this was a rare occurrence, as only four other tropical disturbances were known to have formed prior during this period; since then, reanalysis of previous seasons has concluded that there were more than four tropical cyclones in May before 1940. The season's final system was a tropical disturbance situated in the Greater Antilles, which dissipated on November 8.|$|E
5|$|The oldest {{preserved}} hagiography of Saint Jovan Vladimir {{is contained}} in Chapter 36 of the Chronicle of the Priest of Duklja. This chronicle, written in Latin, was completed between 1299 and 1301 {{in the town of}} Bar, then part of the Serbian Kingdom. Its author was Rudger, the Catholic Archbishop of Bar, who was probably of Czech origin. He wrote Chapter 36 as a summary of an older hagiography of Vladimir, written in Duklja most likely sometime between 1075 and 1089. This is the period when Duklja's rulers from the Vojislavljević dynasty endeavored to obtain the royal insignia from the Pope, and to elevate the Bar Bishopric to an archbishopric. They represented Prince Vladimir as the saintly founder of their dynasty; they were, according to the chronicle, descendants of his uncle Dragimir. The Vojislavljevićs succeeded in those endeavors, though Vladimir was not recognized as a saint by the Catholic Church. Despite its hagiographic nature, Chapter 36 contains a lot of reliable <b>historical</b> <b>data.</b> Chapters 34 and 35, which deal with Vladimir's father and uncles, are probably based on the prologue of the 11th-century hagiography. Chapters 1–33 of the chronicle are based on oral traditions and its author's constructions, and are for the most part dismissed by historians.|$|E
40|$|Disc wheels {{intended}} for normal use on passenger cars {{have to pass}} three tests before going into production: the dynamic cornering fatigue test, the dynamic radial fatigue test, and the impact test. This paper describes a probability model for prediction of fatigue failures of aluminum disc wheels, which intends to better link the prediction using simulation results with <b>historical</b> test <b>data.</b> Finite element models of 54 aluminum wheels, which are already physically tested, are constructed to simulate the dynamic cornering fatigue test. Their mean stresses and stress amplitudes during the fatigue loading cycle are calculated and plotted on a two-dimensional plane. Matching with <b>historical</b> test <b>data,</b> the failure probability contour can be drawn. For a new wheel, the failure probability of dynamic cornering fatigue test can be read directly from this probability contour. The test result of the new wheel can be added into the set of <b>historical</b> test <b>data</b> and the failure probability contour is updated. Same procedure is directly applied to the fatigue prediction of dynamical radial fatigue test. At this point we only have 20 <b>historical</b> test <b>data</b> to construct the failure contour. The prediction will {{become more and more}} reliable as the number of <b>historical</b> test <b>data</b> increases...|$|R
