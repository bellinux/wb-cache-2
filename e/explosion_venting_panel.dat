40|$|In this work, {{a series}} of <b>vented</b> <b>explosions</b> in a typical {{compressor}} compartment are simulated using FLACS code to analyze the <b>explosion</b> <b>venting</b> characteristics. The effects of relevant parameters on the pressure peaks (i. e., overpressure and negative pressure) are also numerically investigated, including vent area ratio of the compressor compartment, vent activation pressure, mass per unit area of <b>vent</b> <b>panels,</b> and volume blockage ratio of obstacles. In addition, the orthogonal experiment design and improved grey relational analysis are implemented to evaluate the impact degree of these relevant parameters. The {{results show that the}} pressure peaks decrease with the increase of vent area ratio. There is an approximately linearly increasing relationship between the pressure peaks and the vent activation pressure. The pressure peaks increase with the mass per unit area of <b>vent</b> <b>panels.</b> The pressure peaks increase with the volume blockage ratio of obstacles. Based on the grey relational grade values, the effects of these relevant parameters on the overpressure peak are ranked as follows: volume blockage ratio of obstacles > vent activation pressure > vent area ratio > mass per unit area of <b>vent</b> <b>panels.</b> These achievements provide effective guidance for the venting safety design of gas compressor compartments...|$|R
40|$|Venting {{systems are}} useful for the {{mitigation}} of ac- cidental <b>explosions.</b> <b>Vent</b> ducts should be used if equipment is located indoors, as NFPA 68 (2007) suggests, for discharging combustion products to safe location.

40|$|International audienceThe most {{commonly}} used method of protection is <b>explosion</b> <b>venting.</b> In its simplest form, a vent is an aperture in the top or side of a vessel to provide a means of pressure relief during an explosion {{in order to achieve}} a reduced explosion pressure Pred. The efficiency of this protection method has been proven by a large number of experiments and documented industrial explosions by which the <b>explosion</b> <b>venting</b> provided adequate protection. From these experiments several correlations have been established to design venting systems. When compared with realistic, less controlled experiments, it appears that the reduced explosion overpressures may be over predicted but also under predicted. During the last ten years, researchers have devoted significant effort and time to study this problem. The state of the dust cloud at ignition and more specificly the initial turbulence has been identified as being a major contributing factor. This paper aims at presenting a technique to take the turbulence into account when designing an <b>explosion</b> <b>venting</b> system...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{objectives}} of the described research were to examine the underlying physical phenomena occurring during flame/obstacles interactions in various chambers of low L/D ratio {{and to develop a}} new empirical equation for <b>explosion</b> <b>venting.</b> A literature review suggested that the propagating flame/obstacle interactions in enclosures with large L/D ratio (> 2) result in flame acceleration and subsequent pressure build-up during a gas explosion. However, the interactions in practical situations with small L/D < 2 were not extensively studied. In this thesis the first investigation involved the flame interaction with different single and multiple obstacles in a 1 / 20 th model of real enclosure. Results provided the basis for flame propagation, local flame displacement speed probability density functions (pdfs), mean flame velocity and explosion pressure. The second investigation of the study involved the flame interaction with multiple bars within chambers of different L/D ratios. The results provided mean flame velocities on each stage, as a function of nondimensional time, and pressure developments as a function of L/D ratio. The final investigation is associated with gas <b>explosion</b> <b>venting.</b> The predictive ability between existing models on <b>explosion</b> <b>venting</b> and experimental results obtained in this thesis were undertaken and found to be deficient. Consequently a new empirical model for predicting <b>explosion</b> <b>venting</b> was developed. The new model was validated with experimental data published in literature...|$|R

40|$|<b>Explosion</b> <b>venting</b> is {{the most}} {{frequently}} used method for mitigating the effects from accidental dust explosions in the process industry. Optimal design of vent systems and credible execution of risk assessments in powder handling plants require practical and reliable ways of predicting the course and consequences of <b>vented</b> dust <b>explosions.</b> The main parameters of interest include flame propagation and pressure build-up inside the vented enclosure, the volume engulfed by the flame, and the magnitude of blast waves outside the enclosure. Extensive experimental work forms the empirical foundation for current standards on vent sizing, such as EN 14491 and NFPA 68, and various types of software for vent area calculations simply apply correlations from these standards. Other models aim at a more realistic description of the geometrical boundary conditions, as well as phenomena such as turbulent compressible particleladen flow and heterogeneous combustion. The latter group include phenomenological tools such as EFFEX, and the CFD code DESC (Dust Explosion Simulation Code). This paper briefly reviews the empirical foundation behind modern guidelines for dust <b>explosion</b> <b>venting,</b> and explores current capabilities and limitations of the CFD code DESC with respect to reproducing results from one experimental study on <b>vented</b> dust <b>explosions.</b> The analysis emphasizes the influence of geometrical features of the enclosures, discrepancies between laboratory test conditions and actual process conditions, and inherent limitations in current modelling capabilities...|$|R

40|$|Relief ducts {{fitted to}} venting {{openings}} {{is a widespread}} configuration in the industrial practice. The presence of a duct {{has been reported to}} severely increase the violence of the <b>vented</b> <b>explosion</b> posing a problem for the proper design of the venting device. Several studies have reported the leading importance - in the whole complex explosion phenomenology - of a secondary explosion in the duct. Modern approaches in the study of simply <b>vented</b> <b>explosions</b> (without ducts) have focused on the study of the interaction between internal and external explosion as a key issue in the mechanisms of pressure generation. The issue is even more relevant when a duct is fitted to the vent due the confined nature of the external explosion. In this work the interaction between internal and external events is experimentally investigated for gas <b>explosions</b> <b>vented</b> through a relief duct. The work has aimed at studying mechanisms underlying the pressure rise of this venting configuration. The study has put the emphasis on the mutual nature of the interaction. A larger scale than laboratory has been investigated allowing drawing results with a greater degree of generality with respect to data so far presented in literature. © 2007 Elsevier B. V.

This work seeks to investigate the influence of non-central and multiple distributed <b>vents</b> on the <b>explosion</b> overpressure. A 10 L cylindrical vessel of 460 mm length and 162 mm diameter (L/D= 2. 8) was used for <b>vented</b> <b>explosion</b> with free <b>venting</b> (without a vent cover). Three different vent coefficient (Kv) were investigated, Kv, 3. 6, 5. 4 and 10. 9 for both non-central and 4 hole vents. 10 % methane-air and 7. 5 % ethylene-air mixtures were investigated to determine the influence of the mixture reactivity. The position of the spark ignition was in the centre of the end flange opposite the vent. It was shown for the non-central vent that the flame speed upstream of the vent was lower than for a central vent and this reduced the mass flow through the vent, which reduced the overpressure and reducing the external explosion due to the lower exit velocity of the unburnt gas and hence lower external turbulence. The external flame jets downstream of the vent was influenced by the increase in characteristic length scale of the vent, which was changed by increasing the number of vents...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - Maintaining air {{circulation}} between the wearer and garment layer {{is crucial for}} activating heat and moisture transfer from the body. If an air gap is trapped, {{air circulation}} may become ineffective and the ventilation of the garment is, thus, hindered. To maintain and extend the air gap, this study aims to propose a design method that involves placing spacer blocks underneath the garment to prevent the fabric from clinging directly to the skin. Design/methodology/approach - To study the application of this design method, a series of T-shirts were produced and tested using a thermal manikin in standing and walking postures. All the T-shirts were made of fabric ostensibly manufactured to have high air permeability. Porous mesh fabric was used to construct the <b>vented</b> <b>panels</b> on the T-shirts. The test was conducted in a chamber with controlled temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity. Total thermal insulation (R-t) and moisture vapour resistance (R-et) were measured. Findings - The test results showed that extension of the air gap between wearer and fabric provided higher ventilation to the wearer if the <b>vented</b> <b>panels</b> were also present on the T-shirts. Different placements of the <b>vented</b> <b>panels</b> on the T-shirts also affected the heat and moisture transfer from the thermal manikin. Research limitations/implications - Due to limited resources, the evaluation of total thermal insulation and moisture vapour resistance {{was based on the}} testing result from a thermal manikin instead of any subjective wearer trial. Practical implications - This research can contribute to the clothing designer who is developing function wear for a better ventilation. Social implications - This research can contribute to the clothing designer who is developing function wear for a better ventilation. Originality/value - This study aimed to further develop a new design concept in T-shirt design by improving the construction of the spacer blocks. Fabric with higher air and water vapour permeability was used to determine to what extent this design method is applicable to higher performance on heat and moisture transfer.
