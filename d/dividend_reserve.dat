40|$|This paper investigates {{dividend}} optimization of {{an insurance}} corporation under {{a more realistic}} model which takes into consideration refinancing or capital injections. The model follows the compound Poisson framework with credit interest for positive reserve, and debit interest for negative reserve. Ruin occurs when the reserve drops below the critical value. The company controls the dividend pay-out dynamically with the objective to maximize the expected total discounted dividends until ruin. We show that that the optimal strategy is a band strategy and it is optimal to pay no <b>dividends</b> when the <b>reserve</b> is negative. ...|$|R
40|$|We study a continuous-time {{contracting}} problem under hidden action, {{where the}} prin-cipal has ambiguous {{beliefs about the}} project cash flows. The principal designs a robust contract that maximizes his utility under the worst-case scenario subject to the agent’s in-centive and participation constraints. Robustness generates endogenous belief heterogene-ity and induces a tradeoff between incentives and ambiguity sharing so that the incentive constraint does not always bind. We implement the optimal contract by cash reserves, debt, and equity. In addition to receiving ordinary <b>dividends</b> when cash <b>reserves</b> reach a threshold, outside equity holders also receive special dividends or inject cash in the cash reserves to hedge against model uncertainty and smooth dividends. Ambiguity aversion raises both the equity premium and the credit yield spread.

40|$|We {{study the}} optimal {{reinsurance}} policy and dividends distribution of {{an insurance company}} under excess of loss reinsurance. The insurer gives part of its premium stream to another company in exchange of an obligation to support {{the difference between the}} amount of the claim and some retention level. The objective of the insurer is to maximise the expected discounted dividends. We suppose that in the absence of <b>dividend</b> distribution, the <b>reserve</b> process of the insurance company follows a compound Poisson process. We first prove existence and uniqueness results for this optimisation problem by using singular stochastic control methods and the theory of viscosity solutions. We then compute the optimal strategy of reinsurance, the optimal strategy of dividends pay-out and the value function by solving the associated integro-differential Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman Variational Inequality numerically {{in the case of a}} Poisson process with constant intensity...|$|R
40|$|We study {{two types}} of robust {{contracting}} problem under hidden action in continuous time. In type I problem, the principal is ambiguous about the project cash flows, while he is ambiguous about the agent’s beliefs in type II problem.

40|$|Previous studies {{quantifying}} {{the effects}} of increased taxation during the U. S. Great Depression find that its contribution is small, in accounting for both the downturn in the early 1930 s and the slow recovery after 1934. This paper shows that this conclusion rests critically {{on the assumption that}} the only taxable capital income is business profits. Effects of capital taxation are much larger when taxes on property, capital stock, excess profits, undistributed profits, and dividends are included in the analysis. When fed into a general equilibrium model, the increased taxes imply significant declines in investment and equity values and nontrivial declines in gross domestic product (GDP) and hours of work. Of particular importance during the Great Depression was the dramatic rise in the effective tax rate on corporate <b>dividends.</b> McGrattan: Federal <b>Reserve</b> Bank of Minneapolis and University of Minnesota.

40|$|A firm whose net {{earnings}} are uncertain, {{and that is}} subject to the risk of bankruptcy, must choose between paying dividends and retaining earnings in a liquid reserve. Also, different operating strategies imply different combinations of expected return and variance. We model the firm 2 ̆ 7 s cash reserve as the difference between the cumulative net earnings and the cumulative dividends. The first is a diffusion (additive), whose drift/volatility pair is chosen dynamically from a finite set, A. The second is an arbitrary nondecreasing process, chosen by the firm. The firm 2 ̆ 7 s strategy must be nonclairvoyant. The firm is bankrupt at the first time, T, at which the cash reserve falls to zero (T may be infinite), and the firm 2 ̆ 7 s objective is to maximize the expected total discounted dividends from 0 to T, given an initial reserve, x; denote this maximum by V(x). We calculate V explicitly, {{as a function of the}} set A and the discount rate. The optimal policy has the form: (1) pay no <b>dividends</b> if the <b>reserve</b> is less than some critical level, a, and pay out all of the excess above a; (2) choose the drift/volatility pairs from the upper extreme points of the convex hull of A, between the pair that minimizes the ratio of volatility to drift and the pair that maximizes the drift; furthermore, the firm switches to successively higher volatility/drift ratios as the reserve increases to a. Finally, for the optimal policy, the firm is bankrupt in finite time, with probability one...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The recent {{financial}} crisis, sparked as {{a result}} of the subprime market in the United States, is regarded by many researchers as the most severe financial crisis to happen since the Great Depression. This crisis has raised the important issue of the spill-over effect of the financial crisis into other sectors of the economy. However, evidence of the effect on firms' behaviour with respect to their financing and investment decisions is limited, and the existing research has mainly concentrated on the publicly listed firms in the US. It is also evident from the findings of existing published studies that the majority of studies do not reach a unanimous conclusion (Alien and Carletti 2008; Bakke 2009; Duchin, Ozbas and Sensoy 2010; Leary 2009; Lemmon and Roberts 2010; Lin and Paravisini 2010 a). Further, the focus of the majority of the existing studies is very narrow with respect to the components of capital structure. As a result, it is not clear from the existing literature which component of the capital structure is more sensitive to credit supply contractions than any other. Moreover, accounting regulations, financial reporting requirements and institutional features are different between the US and the UK, which high!(gl 1 Js the need for more research in this area. In addition, no systematic investigation into the financing and investment decisions of private firms during the crisis has ever taken place in the UK. The main purpose of this study is, therefore, to investigate the financial and investment decisions of both private and public listed finns during the time of the recent financial crisis in the UK. More specifically, this study investigates whether shocks to the supply of credit affect firms' leverage and determines which components of capital structure are affected by credit supply contractions. Further, the study investigates how firms manage their finances during a crisis period. In other words, how firms minimize the effect of credit contractions by resorting to alternative sources of finance such as internal funds, net debt issues, net trade credits and net equity issues. The study also examines whether firms manage their dividend payouts to maintain their financial slack. Finally, the study investigates the effect of the credit crisis on firms' performance and investment decisions. To investigate these issues, the study adopts a comprehensive strategy which consists of three elements, namely, identification of exogenous credit crisis, the use of film fixed effects model and the use of firm level control variables. Data for the analysis are extracted from the FAME and the Datastream databases for the period 2004 - 2009. A total of 4973 private firms are extracted from the FAME database and 2039 public firms are extracted from the Datastream database. The fixed effects analyses highlight that the financial crisis has adversely affected the total debt ratios of both types of firms. This effect is most significant on the short-term financing channel (such as short-term debt and trade credit) in the sample of private firms; while it is the trade credit channel that is negatively affected by the credit crisis in the sample of public firms. The effect on long-term and short-term debt is statistically insignificant in the sample of public firms. There are also differences in the way both types of firm responded to the credit crisis. Private firms, for example, issued more equity and held cash in response to the credit shortage. These firms do not move to net debt issues and net trade credits; nor do they adjust their dividend payout policies during the crisis period. The results further reveal that public firms use more internal funding and repurchase equity in response to the credit drought. These firms also reduced dividend payout to preserve their financial slack. In addition, public firms do not change to net debt issues and net trade credits in response to the credit supply shocks. Moreover, the results reveal that the performance and investment of both types of firm are adversely affected by the credit crisis. This highlights that the inability to obtain external credit and the relative lack of substitution towards alternative sources of finance have negatively affected the performance and investment of both types of firm. Further, in the private firms' sample, the increase in cash holdings and decline in investment suggest that funds raised through the equity issue may have been used to fmance the cash holdings of these firms. In the public firms' sample, decrease in cash <b>reserve,</b> <b>dividend</b> payout and investment in tangible assets suggests that internal funds may have been used to fmance the equity repurchases. Overall, the results suggest that financial and investment policies of private and public firms are sensitive to the credit supply shocks. 11 EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
