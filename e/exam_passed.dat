5000|$|Valparaiso School of Law was censured by the ABA in October 2016, {{for violating}} ABA Standards 501(a) and 501(b). [...] Those {{standards}} require that “a law school shall maintain sound admission policy and practices” and “shall not admit an applicant {{who does not}} appear capable of satisfactorily completing its program of legal education and being admitted to the bar.” In the past, law schools published fraudulent graduate employment data {{in order to attract}} students. After several law schools were sued and the media began covering the fraudulent employment statistics, the ABA required law schools to publish accurate graduate employment data. The accurate employment statistics showed that many graduates were unemployed or were not working in legal jobs. This led to a precipitous decline in applications to law schools. In response, law schools lowered admissions standards so that they could maintain enrollment. Since 2010, Valparaiso drastically reduced admissions standards to maintain the size of the school's student body. In 2010, the entering class had a median LSAT score of 150 and a median GPA of 3.31. By 2015, Valparaiso’s entering class had a median LSAT score of 145 and a median GPA of 2.93. [...] Valparaiso's bar passage rates plummeted as a result. In 2013, 77% of graduates taking the Indiana bar exam and 71% of graduates taking the Illinois bar <b>exam</b> <b>passed</b> on the first attempt. But in 2014, only 61% graduates taking the Indiana bar exam and only 63% of graduates taking the Illinois bar <b>exam</b> <b>passed</b> on the first attempt.|$|E

40|$|Current youth {{training}} and certification efforts, under the Agriculture Hazardous Occupations Order (AgHOs) regulations set forth by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), have not been standardized {{and in some cases}} have been determined to not meet even basic requirements of the order. This is especially true for hands-on evaluation components of the training intended to evaluate operator readiness to safely operate agricultural tractors and equipment. Variability in {{training and}} certification methods potentially leaves some youth, who are unprepared, at risk when encountering hazards while employed to operate allowable agricultural equipment. ^ The goal of this project was to evaluate Purdue University’s Gearing Up for Safety: Production Agriculture Safety Training for Youth (Gearing Up for Safety) curriculum’s assessment components designed to test tractor pre-operational and operational abilities of youth. Through a content validity study, the Pre-Operational and Operational Exams were determined to be reliable by a group of subject matter experts. Passing scores were also refined and finalized for each exam instrument: 70 % for the Written Exam, 85 % for the Pre-Operational Exam, and less than 15 infractions for the Operational Exam. Completion and critical evaluation of the Pre-Operational and Operational testing components complemented the previously validated Written Examination. ^ In addition to gathering validity evidence, the Pre-Operational and Operational Exams were determined, through very high correlations of the data, to provide consistent results with multiple examiners. Instructional resources were also created to assist program leaders when administering the Pre-Operational and Operational Exams. ^ The result of administering the Written Exam utilizing a pre-test/post-test method showed that there was a knowledge gain of 18. 6 % (13 questions). While there was an average increase of 18. 5 % in the mean score, the percentage of participants passing increased from 5. 9 % to 57. 6 %. Of those participants passing the Written Exam and completing the Pre-Operational Exam, a total of 38. 5 % passed. A total of 98. 7 % completing the Operational <b>Exam</b> <b>passed,</b> which indicated those participants lacking required knowledge and skills had been identified and removed during one of the first two stages of testing. The data further showed that 17. 5 % of participants successfully completed all three stages of testing. These findings suggest that the overwhelming majority of youth enrolled in the current AgHOs certification process lack the knowledge or skills to be employed in agricultural production occupations. ...|$|E
