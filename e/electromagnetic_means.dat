25|$|The {{conversion}} of electrical energy into mechanical energy by <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>means</b> was {{demonstrated by the}} English scientist Michael Faraday in 1821. A free-hanging wire was dipped into a pool of mercury, on which a permanent magnet (PM) was placed. When a current was passed through the wire, the wire rotated around the magnet, showing that the current {{gave rise to a}} close circular magnetic field around the wire. This motor is often demonstrated in physics experiments, brine substituting for toxic mercury. Though Barlow's wheel was an early refinement to this Faraday demonstration, these and similar homopolar motors were to remain unsuited to practical application until late in the century.|$|E

In this approach we regard Lambda(1405) as dynamically generated resonances in the octet meson and octet baryon scattering, {{and also as}} KbarN bound state. Especially for the Lambda(1405) as KbarN bound state we obtain negative electric mean squared radius. With the small binding energy of Lambda(1405) in the chiral unitary approach, our results imply that Lambda(1405) has structure that K^- is widely spread around p.

40|$|Exchange effects play an {{important}} role in determining the equilibrium properties of dense matter systems, as well as for magnetic phenomena. There exists an extensive literature concerning, e. g., the effects of exchange interactions on the equation of state of dense matter. Here, a generalization of the Vlasov equation to include exchange effects is presented allowing for <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>mean</b> fields, thus incorporating some of the dynamic effects due to the exchange interactions. Treating the exchange term perturbatively, the correction to classical Langmuir waves in plasmas is found, and the results are compared with previous work. It is noted that the relative importance of exchange effects scales similarly with density and temperature as particle dispersive effects, but that the overall magnitude is sensitive to the details of the specific problem. The implications of our results are discussed. Comment: 9 page...|$|R

5000|$|The {{position}} of the pendulum is sensed by precision electrical contacts or by optical or <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>means.</b> Should acceleration displace the pendulum arm from its null position the sensing mechanism will operate the torque motor and rotate the pedestal such that the property of gyroscopic precession restores the pendulum to its null position. The rate of rotation of the pedestal gives the acceleration while {{the total number of}} rotations of the shaft gives the speed, hence the term [...] "integrating" [...] in the PIGA acronym. A further level of integration of shaft rotations by either electronic means or by mechanical means, such as a Ball-and-disk integrator, can record the displacement or distance traveled, this latter mechanical method being used by early guidance systems prior to the availability of suitable digital computers.|$|E

Dislocations are now Burgers-vector-valued strings that trace out worldsheets in spacetime while the phonons of the solid dualize into two-form (Kalb-Ramond) gauge fields. We propose an effective dual Higgs potential that allows for restoring translational symmetry in either one, two or three directions, leading to the quantum analogues of columnar, smectic or nematic liquid crystals. In these phases, transverse phonons turn into gapped, propagating modes while compressional stress remains massless. Rotational Goldstone modes emerge whenever translational symmetry is restored.
