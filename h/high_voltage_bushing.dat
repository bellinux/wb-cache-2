40|$|Abstract—Superconducting {{equipment}} {{has been}} actively investigated for securing {{the environment and}} energy technology (ET) {{in various parts of}} the world. Despite these movements, a <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> cryogenic <b>bushing,</b> which plays an important role of interconnection between the electric power systems and superconducting devices, has not been fully developed due to severe insulation requirements. A gas insulated cryogenic bushing has been investigated as one of our projects since 2010. As a basic step to obtain the design parameters for cryogenic bushing, we focused on the surface flashover characteristics of glass fiber reinforced plastic (FRP) in several insulation gases. For the surface flashover tests, several insulation gases including SF 6, CF 4 and N 2 gas were prepared. Various length of FRP specimens were fabricated in order to obtain the fundamental data for creepage distance of FRP. The first specimen group was from 2 mm to 10 mm with 2 mm intervals and the second specimen group was from 20 mm to 100 mm with 20 mm intervals. And the gas pressure was varied from 1 bar to 4 bar. An AC overvoltage test and a lightning impulse test were performed. Then the experimental results of surface flashover were obtained and analyzed. Based on these results, it would be possible to design the optimum creepage distance of FRP in a cryogenic bushing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{reports the}} {{progress}} of R&D toward the ITER neutral beam (NB) system at Japan Atomic Energy Agency (JAEA) during 2004 - 2006. In the accelerator development, an H- ion beam of 146 A/m 2 was accelerated up to 836 keV in a vacuum insulated accelerator with five acceleration stages. This is the first production of a high power density beam of MeV range energy, which is relevant to ITER requirements (200 A/m 2 and 1 MeV). The ITER NB system requires a <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> (HV) <b>bushing</b> as an electric feedthrough to the vacuum insulated accelerator. A full-size(1. 56 m in diameter and 0. 292 m in height) insulator ring made of alumina ceramic has been successfully fabricated for the HV bushing, {{as a result of}} technology development of new cold iso-static press (CIP). Long pulse operations of the JT- 60 U negative ion sources are in progress, which has a large extraction area of 0. 45 x 1. 1 m 2. From the ion sources, D- ion beams of 20 A (90 A/m 2), 320 keV have been produced for 21 s. As the consequence, injection of 3. 2 MW D 0 beams was achieved. Thus the long pulse operation of negative ion based NB system has been demonstrated with multi-tens of ampere of D- ions extracted from the ion extraction area relevant to the ITER NB design (0. 6 x 1. 5 m 2). For long pulse operation of such powerful beams, the negative ion uniformity over the wide extraction area is an essential issue to avoid excess power loading on the accelerator grids. By adopting a new magnetic configuration with so called “tent filter”, the uniformity of the JAEA 10 ampere source (extraction area: 0. 13 x 0. 22 m 2) was improved to be ± 4 %, which fulfilled the ITER requirement (± 10 %). 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{detail the}} {{calibration}} of the D-dot probes {{used on the}} Los Alamos National Laboratory DARHT Axis 1 LIA compensation cans (CCs). We hope this will serve {{not only as a}} record of this calibration, but also as a guide on how to perform similar calibrations on other systems where D-dots are deployed. Although a simple measurement, its difficulty {{lies in the fact that}} the same geometry used when fielded must be used during calibration, the ultimate goal being to measure the capacitance between the probe sensor and the component whose voltage one intends to measure. Because of its linearity with voltage, this can be done at a lower voltage than during fielding, the only caveat being that this lower voltage pulse must still provide enough signal to noise. After a brief summary of our results, we include a description of a compensation can, the D-dot probe and its operation.

40|$|Considering {{the damage}} {{mechanism}} of oil-impregnated paper insulation in power transformers, shunt reactors and other high voltage electrical apparatus caused by partial discharge, {{a concept of}} “destructive partial discharge” is introduced in this paper. The intensity of this discharge is regarded as several thousands pico-coulomb (pC) and may cause the insulation a fatal damage. An oil-paper insulation is usually able to withstand this type of partial discharge {{for a period of}} time prior to failure. This provides engineers a time window to detect it. This paper describes an on-line partial discharge monitoring system for 500 kV shunt reactors. The commission results from 3 single-phase shunt reactors either connected or disconnected to the grid showed that the on-line partial discharge detecting system has a high noise immunising ability. Two years later after the installation, a pre-warning signal was received from one shunt reactor indicating the existence of an intermittent discharge. The acoustic emission system located its position at the low end of the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>bushing</b> in the oil. Dissolved gasses analysis (DGA) in the oil suggested the presence of partial discharge, as acetylene (C 2 H 2) was as high as 20 ppm. PD activity was further confirmed by a physical examination on the reactor...|$|E
40|$|Liquid {{nitrogen}} (LN 2) {{has been}} proposed as a coolant for high temperature superconducting (HTS) applications also as electrical insulation. Partial discharge (PD) activity indicates overstressing of the liquid dielectric or contamination which may provide {{an indication of the}} health of the dielectric and provide a useful precursor to the electric failure of LN 2. The conventional method for PD measurements is restricted to a narrow bandwidth (less than 600 kHz). It has been shown that streamer discharges in liquid dielectrics consist of many small pulses, which due to the limited bandwidth of the PD detector would be integrated overtime by conventional equipment and recorded as single pulse [1]. The application of ultra high frequency (UHF) sensors can provide greater precision in the measurement of the discharge pulses during the pre-breakdown streamer phenomena in LN 2. In addition, the UHF technique can be installed as on-line monitoring system with the capability of locating the discharge sources using the time-of-flight method, as {{has been proposed}} for oil filled transformer designs [8]. This paper explores the use of UHF sensors to measure PD in LN 2. The experiments utilise a point to plane electrode configuration located inside a cryostat with <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>bushing</b> rated to 50 kV PD free [2]. The sensor is mounted on the outside wall of the cryostat with uses of dielectric windows and signals are captured by a digital oscilloscope with a bandwidth of 2. 5 GHz.

40|$|A <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>bushing</b> {{is a very}} {{important}} accessory of power transformers. Bushings are used to insulate high voltage conductors where they feed through steel tank of a power transformer. There are different sources of electric stress that may result in degradation of bushing. Partial discharges (PDs) are one of the main sources of electrical degradation. PDs occur due to defects in electrical insulations, and can lead to insulation failure. This thesis is composed of two parts. The first part deals with design of a 145 kV oil impregnated paper (OIP) bushing by using capacitive radial grading technique. In capacitive grading the foils of calculated length are placed at predetermined radial distance between the paper layers in order to distribute voltage and electric field uniformly between high voltage conductor and ground potential. A 145 kV OIP bushing was designed according to dimensions of ABB GOE type bushing. After calculations, the 145 kV bushing geometry was modeled in COMSOL Multiphysics in order to analyze the voltage and electric field distribution in the bushing. In the second part of this thesis a scaled down model was designed using the capacitive radial grading technique. After designing, the scale down model was implemented in COMSOL {{in order to ensure that}} the voltage and electric field distribution should be similar to the full scale model of bushing. The scaled down bushing test model was made in laboratory by wrapping impregnated papers and foils on conductor tube according to calculated dimensions. These papers were impregnated with mineral oil. The test model was placed in an oil filled tube. Different defects were added in scale down bushing model and model was connected to PD measurement set up. PD inception voltage was measured and PD patterns were recorded on an insulation condition monitoring system (ICM). These patterns are analyzed in order to conclude about the signature of partial discharges in OIP bushings. From the PD pattern, the type and location of PDs can be concluded. PD patterns reveal that the main causes of PDs in OIP bushing can be gas filled cavities and surface discharges from foil edges...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents the}} means to evaluate lightning performance of pole-mounted distribution transformers and Medium Voltage (MV) distribution lines. The main intention {{is to provide a}} general bench-mark procedure for analysis of lightning performances of pole-mounted transformers and MV distribution lines and thereby to ensure proper installation and reduction of the high lightning failure rate existing in Sri Lanka. // In installation of HV surge arresters, the separation length between the arrester and the <b>high</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>bushing</b> is of paramount importance. Thus the calculation of the separation lengths and failure rates are first discussed and the drawbacks of the present method of installation are presented. The required separation depends on several factors such as tower configuration, system voltage, tower surge impedance, the length of the earth wire of the arrester etc. Effect of ground flash and residual voltage of arresters impart a considerable contribution to the transformer protection. An alternative approach for this is also presented. The role of the earth resistance and its contribution to High Voltage and Low Voltage failures due to lightning are discussed indicating typical modes of failure. The determination of a safe value for the earth resistance is also presented// Flashover due to lightning induced surge voltages is of paramount importance in evaluating reliability and power quality of Medium Voltage distribution lines. First, analysis has been done on flashovers due to direct lightning. Next a comprehensive analysis has been done to develop a method to evaluate lightning performance against lightning induced flashes. Accuracy of the algorithms to calculate lightning induced line flashes highly depends on parameters such as wave front time of return stroke current, magnitude of the return stroke current and its probability distribution and the speed of the return stroke current. Having selected the most suitable values for these parameters, a technique has been developed to determine line flas hover rates due to induced lightning. Next, cumulative effect of both direct and indirect lightning surges has been discussed. Analysis has been done to study dependence of line flas hover rates on line insulation levels,isokeraunic level, line height, wave front time, corona damping, shielding due to near by objects etc. Variation of line flas hover rates with above parameters has been discussed. Theoretical results have been compared with practical data as a measure to check adequacy of the developed analysis technique.
