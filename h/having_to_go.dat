5|$|Celtic faced Yugoslavia (now Serbian) side Vojvodina Novi Sad in the quarter-finals, {{and lost}} {{the first leg}} 1–0 after a goal from Milan Stanić; this was Celtic's only defeat of the competition. The tie {{looked like it was}} going to end in a draw after Chalmers had given Celtic a 1–0 lead in the second leg. This would have {{resulted}} in the teams from <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to Rotterdam for a replay. However, in the 90th minute captain Billy McNeill scored to give Celtic the victory. In the semi-finals, Czechoslovakian side Dukla Prague were beaten 3–1 in Glasgow, Johnstone put the hosts in front, before Stanislav Štrunc equalised. A second half brace from Willie Wallace gave Celtic the victory. The teams then drew 0–0 in Prague, which meant Celtic progressed to the final.|$|E

5|$|In two instances, the equestrian {{portion of}} the Olympics has been held in a {{different}} location {{from the rest of}} the games. The first was during the 1956 Summer Olympics in Melbourne, Australia when, due to Australian quarantine laws, the equestrian portion was held in Stockholm, Sweden. At the next IOC meeting, it was decided to hold a special Equestrian Olympic Games several months before the actual Olympics, complete with its own opening and closing ceremonies. This meant that Switzerland, which had officially boycotted the 1956 Games because of the Soviet Union's recent invasion of Hungary, still brought home a medal because of its participation in the equestrian portion several months earlier. The second instance was during the 2008 Summer Olympics, when the equestrian events were held in Hong Kong rather than Beijing. This decision was made when, in 2005, international veterinary groups refused to certify the main Olympic city as free of equine diseases. This would have resulted in horses leaving Beijing after the games and <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through lengthy quarantine processes before being allowed to re-enter their home countries. Hong Kong also had the benefit of having better facilities, including a top equine hospital and one of only a few equine drug-testing labs in the world.|$|E

25|$|Colorectal {{cancer is}} a disease of old age: It {{typically}} originates in the secretory cells lining the gut, and risk factors include diets low in vegetable fibre and high in fat.

25|$|Will Smith {{conceived}} {{this story}} {{when he was}} watching the television show called I Shouldn't Be Alive with his brother-in-law Caleeb Pinkett. It was originally not a science fiction story but about {{a father and son}} crashing their car in the mountains or some remote region, with the son <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> out and get rescue for his father. Smith then decided to change the setting to 1000 years in the future, which imposed a higher budget. The film was also intended to be the first in a trilogy. Smith had his production company Overbrook contact Gary Whitta (who was then known for his script for The Book of Eli) with a simple log line for a film: a father and son crash landed on Earth 1000 years after it had been abandoned by humankind. Impressed with his idea and excited about the opportunity to work with him, Whitta fleshed out Smith's idea and pitched it to him, subsequently becoming the first employee on the project.|$|E
25|$|Emily {{attended}} the University of Deseret. For a time, {{she was a}} school teacher. In 1883, Grant asked Emily to marry him.

Emily then {{had a change of heart}} and she and Grant married on May 27, 1884. Since the Edmunds Act had been enacted in 1882, the situation of Mormon polygamists was far worse than it had been a decade earlier when Emily had first renounced polygamy. To avoid Grant <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> to prison on charges of unlawful cohabitation, Emily went to England to live at the LDS mission home to have her first child. She returned to the United States 16 months later and moved between multiple locations in Utah Territory and Idaho to avoid capture.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} Catholic churches. The largest church in Carrick Mór is St Nicholas' churchwhich {{was built in}} 1879, {{replacing}} an earlier church {{of the same name}} built in 1804. In Carrick Beg are the small St Molleran's parish church (parts of which date back to the 13th century) and the larger Franciscan friary. The Franciscan order's presence in Carrick dates back to 1336 with the granting of land for a friary by the 1st Earl of Ormond. However, the suppression of monasteries by Henry VIII led to the closure of the friary. Just prior to the invasion of Ireland by Cromwell, the friars had returned for an 11-year period, before being shut down again and the friars <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> underground to avoid persecution. It was not until 1820 and the onset of Catholic Emancipation that the friars were able to fully return and a new chapel was built. The friars served the local community until the lack of vocations to the order led to the order finally leaving Carrick-Beg in 2006.|$|E
25|$|ABA's U.S. Gold Cup {{series of}} events were created in 1981 and then, in 2000, {{as part of the}} {{sponsorship}} agreement with then-sponsor Redline Bicycles, was renamed the Redline Cup Series, before switching back to being called the Gold Cup in 2014 following Redline's decision to no longer sponsor the successful series. Gold Cup (Redline Cup) races are a series of regional championship events that are held mostly {{for the benefit of the}} amateur racer - with a No.1 plate (designated by a yellow background) on the line for the overall winner of the age and classification. Its original purpose was to give non factory sponsored amateurs-then as today the great majority of BMX racers-a chance for a national title without <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> through the great expense of touring the country racing in nationals competing against sponsored national caliber racers. It originally was a one-off Jag like Championship race on November 27, 1981 in which the competitors just had to come in the top 100 in their districts to compete. It became a six race qualifying series in 1982 held in conjunction with standard nationals. Like in its inaugural year, the Championships was held the day before the ABA Grand Nationals in Oklahoma as a pre race. In succeeding years the ABA allowed the track operators to choose when to hold the qualifying races and they weren't held at the same time and place as nationals with the finals being held in Las Vegas, Nevada in October. In the year 2001 the ABA changed the name of the U.S. Gold Cup Series to the Redline Cup Series. Redline Bicycles had been sponsoring the Gold Cup Series for the prior six racing seasons. Today the Gold Cup Series Championship or simply the Gold Cup, is the second most sought after title in the ABA. The races are a series of over 60 multi-point (double and triple) qualifying races in 35 states in the U.S. and one Canadian Province (2008 edition), which is divided into Western, Central and Eastern regions of approximately 14 to 21 qualifying races in each region.|$|E
