40|$|In natural uranium, {{there are}} trace {{amounts of the}} “minor isotope ” 234 U in {{addition}} to the more abundant 235 U and 238 U. Uranium irradiated in a reactor and separated from the spent reactor fuel by reprocessing will contain additional minor isotopes. In uranium <b>enrichment,</b> <b>cascades</b> of separating units are tuned to produce the desired level of the isotope 235 U, but the levels of other isotopes will also change. Measurement of the assays of the 235 U in the feed, product and withdrawal streams of each stage allow the calculation of the stage separation factor for the 235 U. The separation factors for the other isotopes may be calculated. In this aritcle, two methods of modeling the separation factors in a way that represents the physics of two enrichment processes, gas centrifuge and gaseous diffusion, are explored. This technique could be a valuable tool in nuclear forensics. For example, it could be important to know the origin of a sample of highly enriched uranium, found either in intercepted material or in explosive debris. Analysis that could point to the enrichment plant where the uranium was produced could immediately identify weaknesses in safeguards and physical security systems...|$|R
40|$|Technetium is a {{radioactive}} {{product of the}} nuclear fission process. During reprocessing of spent or partially spent fuel from nuclear reactors, the technetium can be released and contaminate other, otherwise good, metals. A specific example is equipment in gaseous diffusion uranium <b>enrichment</b> <b>cascades</b> which {{have been used to}} process fuel which was returned from reactors, so-called reactor returns. These returns contained volatile technetium compounds which contaminated the metals in the equipment. Present regulations require that technetium be removed before the metal can be re-used at non-radioactive sites. Removing the technetium from contaminated metals has two desirable results. First, the large amount of nonradioactive metal produced by the process herein described can be recycled at a much lower cost than virgin metal can be produced. Second, large amounts of radioactively contaminated metal can be reduced to relatively small amounts of radioactive slag and large amounts of essentially uncontaminated metal. A new and improved process for removing technetium from iron and other metals is described in which between 1 / 10 atom % and 5 atom % of manganese is added to the contaminated metal in order to replace the technetium...|$|R

40|$|Building K- 33 was {{constructed}} in 1954 as the final section of the five-stage uranium <b>enrichment</b> <b>cascade</b> at the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant (ORGDP). The two original building (K- 25 and K- 27) were used to produce weapons grade highly enriched uranium (HEU). Building K- 29, K- 31, and K- 33 were added to produce low enriched uranium (LEU) for nuclear power plant fuel. During ORGDP operations K- 33 produced a peak enrichment of 2. 5 %. Thousands of tons of reactor tails fed into gaseous diffusion plants in the 1950 s and early 1960 s introducing some fission products and transuranics. Building K- 33 was a two-story, 25 -meters (82 -feet) tall structure with approximately 30 hectare (64 acres) of floor space. The Operations (first) Floor contained offices, change houses, feed vaporization rooms, and auxiliary equipment to support enrichment operations. The Cell (second) Floor contained the enrichment process equipment and was divided into eight process units (designated K- 902 - 1 through K- 902 - 8). Each unit contained ten cells, and each cell contained eight process stages (diffusers) {{for a total of}} 640 enrichment stages. 1985 : LEU buildings were taken off-line after the anticipated demand for uranium enrichment failed to materialize. 1987 : LEU buildings were placed in permanent shutdown. Process equipment were maintained in a shutdown state. 1997 : DOE signed an Action Memorandum for equipment removal and decontamination of Buildings K- 29, K- 31, K- 33; BNFL awarded contract to reindustrialize the buildings under the Three Buildings D&D and Recycle Project. 2002 : Equipment removal complete and effort shifts to vacuuming, chemical cleaning, scabbling, etc. 2005 : Decontamination efforts in K- 33 cease.

40|$|The {{physical}} {{modeling of}} uranium isotopes (235 U, 238 U) separation process by centrifugation of {{is a key}} aspect for predicting the nuclear fuel enrichment plant performances under surveillance by the Nuclear Safeguards Authorities. In this paper are illustrated {{some aspects of the}} modeling of fast centrifuges for UF 6 gas enrichment and of a typical <b>cascade</b> <b>enrichment</b> plant with the Theoretical Centrifuge and Cascade Simulator (TCCS). The background theory for reproducing the flow field characteristics of a centrifuge is derived from the work of Cohen [1] where the separation parameters are calculated using the solution of a differential enrichment equation. In our case we chose to solve the hydrodynamic equations for the motion of a compressible fluid in a centrifugal field using the Berman – Olander vertical velocity radial distribution [2] and the solution was obtained using the Matlab software tool [3]. The importance of a correct estimation of the centrifuge separation parameters at different flow regimes, lies in the possibility to estimate in a reliable way the U enrichment plant performances, once the separation external parameters are set (feed flow rate and feed, product and tails assays) [4]. Using the separation parameters of a single centrifuge allow to determine the performances of an entire cascade and, for this purpose; the software Simulink [3] was used. The outputs of the calculation are the concentrations (assays) and the flow rates of the enriched (product) and depleted (tails) gas mixture. These models represent a valid additional tool, in order to verify the compliance of the U enrichment plant operator declarations with the “on site” inspectors’ measurements. JRC.

Sungri/ 96 vaccine strain {{is widely used}} for mass vaccination programs in India against PPR and is considered the most potent vaccine providing long-term immunity. However, occurrence of outbreaks due to emerging PPR viruses may be a challenge. In this study, the temporal dynamics of immune response in goat {{peripheral blood mononuclear cells}} (PBMCs) infected with Sungri/ 96 vaccine virus was investigated by transcriptome analysis. Infected goat PBMCs at 48 h and 120 h post infection revealed 2540 and 2000 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively, on comparison with respective controls. Comparison of the infected samples revealed 1416 DEGs to be altered across time points. Functional analysis of DEGs reflected enrichment of TLR signaling pathways, innate immune response, inflammatory response, positive regulation of signal transduction and cytokine production. The upregulation of innate immune genes during early phase (between 2 - 5 days) viz. interferon regulatory factors (IRFs), tripartite motifs (TRIM) and several interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) in infected PBMCs and interactome analysis indicated induction of broad-spectrum anti-viral state. Several Transcription factors – IRF 3, FOXO 3 and SP 1 that govern immune regulatory pathways were identified to co-regulate the DEGs. The results from this study, highlighted the involvement of both innate and adaptive immune systems with the <b>enrichment</b> of complement <b>cascade</b> observed at 120 h p. i., suggestive of a link between innate and adaptive immune response.

40|$|Adipose-derived {{stem cells}} (ADSC), which exist near adipocytes in adipose tissue, {{have been used}} as a {{potential}} tool of regenerative medicine. Lipid chaperones, fatty acid-binding protein 4 (FABP 4) and 5 (FABP 5), are abundantly expressed in adipocytes. FABP 4 has recently been shown to be secreted from adipocytes during lipolysis in a non-classical pathway and may act as an adipokine. Here, we investigated the role of exogenous FABP 4 and FABP 5 in transcriptional and metabolic regulation in ADSC. FABP 4 and FABP 5 were little expressed in ADSC. However, both FABP 4 and FABP 5 were significantly induced after adipocyte differentiation of ADSC and were secreted from the differentiated adipocytes. Analysis of microarray data, including gene ontology <b>enrichment</b> analysis and <b>cascade</b> analysis of the protein-protein interaction network using a transcription factor binding site search, demonstrated that treatment of ADSC with FABP 4 or FABP 5 affected several kinds of genes related to inflammatory and metabolic responses and the process of cell differentiation. Notably, myogenic factors, including myocyte enhancer factors, myogenic differentiation 1 and myogenin, were modulated by treatment of ADSC with FABP 4, indicating that exogenous FABP 4 treatment is partially associated with myogenesis in ADSC. Metabolome analysis showed that treatment of ADSC with FABP 4 and with FABP 5 similarly, but differently in extent, promoted hydrolysis and/or uptake of lipids, consequentially together with enhancement of β oxidation, inhibition of downstream of the glycolysis pathway, accumulation of amino acids, reduction of nucleic acid components and increase in the ratio of reduced and oxidized nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphates (NADPH/NADP+), an indicator of reducing power, and the ratio of adenosine triphosphate and adenosine monophosphate (ATP/AMP), an indicator of the energy state, in ADSC. In conclusion, secreted FABP 4 and FABP 5 from adipocytes as adipokines differentially affect transcriptional and metabolic regulation in ADSC near adipocytes. The adiposity condition in the host of regenerative medicine may affect characteristics of ADSC by exposure of the balance of FABP 4 and FABP 5...|$|R

This toxin {{is carried}} by multiple reef-fish species and human consumption of ciguatoxins {{can result in}} an explosive gastrointestinal/neurologic illness. This study characterizes the global transcriptional response in mouse brain to a symptomatic dose of the highly toxic Pacific ciguatoxin P-CTX- 1 and additionally compares this data to transcriptional profiles from liver and whole blood examined previously. Adult male C 57 /BL 6 mice were injected with 0. 26 ng/g P-CTX- 1 while controls received only vehicle. Animals were sacrificed at 1, 4 and 24 hrs and transcriptional profiling was performed on brain RNA with Agilent whole genome microarrays. RT-PCR was used to independently validate gene expression and the web tool DAVID was used to analyze gene ontology (GO) and molecular pathway enrichment of the gene expression data. Results A pronounced 4 °C hypothermic response was recorded in these mice, reaching a minimum at 1 hr and lasting for 8 hrs post toxin exposure. Ratio expression data were filtered by intensity, fold change and p-value, with the resulting data used for time course analysis, K-means clustering, ontology classification and KEGG pathway enrichment. Top GO hits for this gene set included acute phase response and mono-oxygenase activity.

40|$|The minor isotope 232 U may {{ultimately}} {{be used for}} detection or confirmation of uranium {{in a variety of}} applications. The primary advantage of 232 U as an indicator of the presence of enriched uranium is the plentiful and penetrating nature of the radiation emitted by its daughter radionuclide 208 Tl. A possible drawback to measuring uranium via 232 U is the relatively high uncertainty in 232 U abundance both within and between material populations. An important step in assessing this problem is to ascertain what determines the 232 U concentration within any particular sample of uranium. To this end, we here analyze the production and eventual enrichment of 232 U during fuel-cycle operations. The goal of this analysis is to allow approximate prediction of 232 U quantities, or at least some interpretation of the results of 232 U measurements. We have found that 232 U is produced via a number of pathways during reactor irradiation of uranium and is subsequently concentrated during the later enrichment of the uranium' s 235 U Content. While exact calculations are nearly impossible for both the reactor-production and cascade-enrichment parts of the prediction problem, estimates and physical bounds can be provided as listed below and detailed within the body of the report. Even if precise calculations for the irradiation and enrichment were possible, the ultimate 212 U concentration would still depend upon the detailed fuel-cycle history. Assuming that a thennal-diffusion cascade is used to produce highly enriched uranium (HEU), dilution of reactor-processed fuel at the cascade input and the long-term holdup of 232 U within the cascade both affect the 232 U concentration in the product. Similar issues could be expected to apply for the other isotope-separation technologies that are used in other countries. Results of this analysis are listed below: 0 The 232 U concentration depends strongly on the uranium enrichment, with depleted uranium (DU) containing between 1600 and 8000 times less 232 U than HEU does. * The 236 U/ 232 U concentration ratio in HEU is likely to be between 10 {sup 6 } and 2 x 10 {sup 7 }. 0 Plutonium-production reactors yield uranium with between I and 10 ppt of 232 u. 0 Much higher 132 U concentrations can be obtained in some situations. * Significant variation in the 232 U concentration is inevitable. * <b>Cascade</b> <b>enrichment</b> increases the 232 U concentration by a factor of at least 200, and possibly as much as 1000. 0 The actual 232 U concentration depends upon the dilution at the cascade input...|$|R
