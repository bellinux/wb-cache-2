All were painted black with [...] "satin" [...] effect body {{graphics}} on the vehicles sides and bonnet carrying the [...] "60th" [...] logo used throughout 2008 at various special events and on anniversary merchandise. Bespoke five-spoke alloy wheels were used and a new silver-coloured front grille design was used. This also incorporated a new design of headlamp with the sidelight lamp being integral with the main headlamp unit, allowing the space previously used for the separate sidelight to be used to fit a pair of high-intensity driving lamps. Inside the SVX models gained Recaro bucket seats in the front row, alloy gearlever knobs and a Garmin GPS navigation system. The drivetrain was the standard 2.4-litre diesel and six-speed manual permanent four-wheel-drive transmission. The SVX edition was available as a 110 (only available outside the UK), a 90 and a brand-new design of 90 soft top- the first time a soft top model had been available through showrooms in the UK since 1992. SVX soft tops had only the two front seats- the rear load bay being used to accommodate the spare wheel and a lockable storage box. A new design of hood was used, sloping down towards the rear over a jointed <b>folding</b> <b>frame,</b> unlike the standard square-framed hood used on other soft top Land Rovers.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA recent {{method for}} {{modeling}} folds uses a <b>fold</b> <b>frame</b> with coordinates {{based on the}} structural geology of folds: fold axis direction, fold axial surface and extension direction. The fold geometry can be characterised by rotating the <b>fold</b> <b>frame</b> by the pitch of the fold axis in the axial surface and the angle between the folded foliation and the axial surface. These rotation angles can be expressed as 1 D functions of the <b>fold</b> <b>frame</b> coordinates. In this contribution we present methods for extracting and automatically modeling the fold geometries from structural data. The fold rotation angles used for characterising the fold geometry can be calculated locally from structural observations. The fold rotation angles incorporate the structural geology of the fold and allow for individual structural measurements to be viewed {{in the context of}} the folded structure. To filter out the effects of later folding the fold rotation angles are plotted against the coordinates of the <b>fold</b> <b>frame.</b> Using these plots the geometry of the folds can be interpolated directly from structural data where we use a combination of radial basis function and harmonic analysis to interpolate and extrapolate the fold geometry. This contribution addresses a major limitation in existing methods where the fold geometry was not constrained from structural data. We present two case studies: a proof of concept synthetic model of a non-cylindrical fold and an outcrop of an asymmetrical fold within the Lachlan Fold belt at Cape Conran, Victoria, Australia...|$|R

40|$|Rigid-foldable cube-type and eggbox-type kirigami {{geometries}} {{have been}} of interest for applications including folded-core sandwich panels and deployable structures. Recent studies of these geometry families noticed that their convex pattern vertices enabled several further potential applications that were not otherwise possible with the concave vertices of more common pattern families such as Miura-type patterns. The following paper investigates one such application: the synthesis of <b>folded</b> <b>frame</b> structures from kirigami pattern geometric parametrisations. A new synthesis method is proposed for two geometries: a twoway orthogonal lattice frame generated from a kirigami cube pattern; and a multi-layer octahedral frame generated from a non-developable eggbox pattern. Both frames are developed with initial translation of <b>folded</b> geometries to <b>frame</b> element centrelines and subsequent generation of integral frame elements with pattern sub-folds.

40|$|Background: Wheelchairs provide {{mobility}} {{that can}} enhance function and community integration. Function {{in a wheelchair}} is influenced by wheelchair design. Objectives: To explore the impact of wheelchair design on user function and the variables that guided wheelchair prescription in the study setting. Method: A mixed-method, descriptive design using convenience sampling was implemented. Quantitative {{data were collected from}} 30 wheelchair users using the functioning every day with a Wheelchair Scale and a Wheelchair Specification Checklist. Qualitative data were collected from ten therapists who prescribed wheelchairs to these users, through interviews. The Kruskal-Wallis test was used to identify relationships, and content analysis was undertaken to identify emerging themes in qualitative data. Results: Wheelchairs with urban designs were issued to 25 (83 %) participants. Wheelchair size, fit, support and functional features created challenges concerning transport, operating the wheelchair, performing personal tasks, and indoor and outdoor mobility. Users using wheelchairs designed for use in semi-rural environments achieved significantly better scores regarding the appropriateness of the prescribed wheelchair than those using wheelchairs designed for urban use (p = < 0. 01). Therapists prescribed the basic, four-wheel <b>folding</b> <b>frame</b> design most often {{because of a lack of}} funding, lack of assessment, lack of skills and user choice. Conclusion: Issuing urban type wheelchairs to users living in rural settings might have a negative effect on users’ functional outcomes. Comprehensive assessments, further training and research, on long term cost and quality of life implications, regarding provision of a suitable wheelchair versus a cheaper less suitable option is recommended. </p...|$|E
40|$|Currently, wheelchairs in {{developing}} countries are supplied both through donations from NGOs and local wheelchair workshops in these countries. A popular type of wheelchair manufactured by these workshops is a three-wheeled wheelchair, which has a long wheel base and third castor wheel {{in front of the}} chair. These wheelchairs perform better in the rough terrain of the developing world, but do not have a <b>folding</b> <b>frame,</b> and thus cannot be transported. This severely diminishes the ability of the wheelchair's user to travel far distances and generate income. Because of this problem, this project aims at developing a frame for the three-wheeled wheelchair that folds into small dimensions similar to a traditional four-wheeled wheelchair. (cont.) The major considerations when designing this wheelchair were weight, cost, and local availability of materials. All materials used for the wheelchair {{can be found in the}} majority of developing countries, as they consist of mild steel, bicycle parts, ABS plastic, and canvas for the seat. After evaluation of designs, a double L-brace, which very closely resembles the x-braces used in traditional four-wheeled wheelchairs, was decided upon. Being similar to these wheelchairs will increase user acceptance of this wheelchair. Analysis optimized the dimensions of the L-brace, and found all forces and moments on the wheelchair, so that the size of mild steel piping could be minimized, thus reducing both the weight and cost. The maximum moment in the center rod of the wheelchair was found to be 236. 0 Nm and in the L-brace the maximum moment was 315. 9 Nm. With the application of a safety factor, these values lead to the selection of mild steel piping with a diameter of 48. 25 mm and a thickness of 1. 5 mm for the center rod and a diameter of 60 mm and a thickness of 1. 2 mm for the rest of the frame. Using these materials give a final material cost of $ 89. 01, significantly less than the current cost of $ 230. The final weight is estimated to be 55. 1 pounds, which is much higher than the current weight of only 45 pounds. This will be an important feature to look at in future work, and hopefully this new design can be reduced to about 45 pounds. by Amanda Joy Maguire. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|An {{important}} step in understanding how a protein folds is to determine those regions of the sequence that are critical to both its stability and its folding pathway. We chose phosphoribosyl anthranilate isomerase from Escherichia coli, which is a monomeric representative of the (beta alpha) 8 barrel family of proteins, to construct a variant that carries an internal tandem duplication of the fifth beta alpha module. This (beta alpha) 9 variant was enzymically active and therefore must have a wild-type (beta alpha) 8 core. It had a choice a priori to fold to three different <b>folding</b> <b>frames,</b> which are distinguished by carrying the duplicated segment as an insert into {{one out of three}} different loops. Steady-state kinetic constants, the fluorescence properties of a crucial tryptophan residue, and limited proteolysis showed that the stable (beta alpha) 9 variant carries the insertion between beta-strand 5 and alpha-helix 5.

40|$|Abstract. A {{successful}} {{design of}} folding bicycle should {{take into account}} the function, material properties, and fabrication process. There are some other factors that should be considered in anticipating the behavior of materials for folding bicycle. In order to understand the relationship between material properties and design of a folding bicycle and also for the future direction in new materials with new design, a comprehensive study on the design under different conditions are essential. Therefore, a systematic study on the relationship between material properties and design for folding bicycle has been performed. The advantages and disadvantages matrix between conventional bicycle and folding bicycle is presented for better understanding of the materials properties and design. It was found that the materials properties of the <b>folding</b> bicycle <b>frame</b> such as fatigue and tensile strength are the important properties for the better performance of the frame. The relationship between materials properties and design is not straight forward because the behavior of the material in the finished product could be {{different from that of the}} raw material.
