40|$|In 1996, the Oakland, California {{school board}} passed a {{resolution}} that ignited fervent debate, both linguistic and pedagogical. It resolved that the first language of African American students was indeed not English, but ‘Ebonics’, and it proposed improve the literacy of these students by applying ESL methodology that was already in place for students with a first language other than English: the instruction of English {{through the medium of}} the first language. This paper will explore the revelatory controversy that ensued. The debate called attention to the highly arbitrary nature of the distinction between languages and dialects, and more importantly to the prevailing negative attitude towards non-standard linguistic varieties. The resolution was later amended and many of its original claims were mitigated, but it continued to call for the valorization of Ebonics in the classroom as a bridge to the instruction of Standard English.

We will show that in accordance with Strauss (1993 a, 1993 b) and Kinsui and Takubo (1990, 1992), instruction of demonstratives based on the traditional analysis of plus/minus proximity is inadequate. Data from intermediate and advanced L 2 learners as well as from native speakers of each language are examined according to recent models (i. e., Strauss' focus schema and Kinsui and Takubo's domain theory of the speaker's experience/perception), which prove to be promising alternatives in teaching demonstratives to L 2 learners of Japanese and English...|$|R

While enrolled in ESL courses, students may take some additional content area courses, depending on a student's level.|$|R
40|$|School {{professionals}} are often {{dissatisfied with the}} current model of English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) elementary education. The typical 30 - 45 minute pull-out session often frustrates ESL teachers because {{of the amount of}} time is inadequate. This causes frustration among the mainstream teachers because of the class time the ESL learners miss. Teachers involved in inclusion models sometimes feel their expertise is not being utilized, and. believe that ESL students need some time away from their native, English-speaking peers to be comfortable practicing their own language skills. Teachers of self-contained ESL classes often believe that their students have too little academic and social interaction {{with the rest of the}} school.

5000|$|Interest {{from foreign}} {{language}} learners was limited prior to World War II, and <b>instruction</b> <b>for</b> non-heritage <b>speakers</b> was established more slowly. One 1934 survey found only eight {{universities in the}} United States offering Japanese language education, mostly supported by only one instructor per university; it further estimated that only thirteen American professors possessed sufficient fluency in the Japanese language {{to use it in}} conducting research. As late as 1940, there were only 65 non-Japanese Americans who were able to read, write and understand the language. Even among nisei graduates of the community Japanese schools, true fluency was rare: a 1941 Military Intelligence Service survey of 3,700 nisei found that 3 percent could potentially become competent after extensive training, 4 percent were [...] "proficient" [...] but still required additional instruction, and just 3 percent were qualified for linguistic work in Japanese. Due to this shortage, the military's need for personnel competent in Japanese even before the US entry into World War II drove the MIS to establish its own specialized school aimed at training specialists to serve as interpreters, interrogators, and translators, the Military Intelligence Service Language School; initially based at the Presidio of San Francisco, it was later moved to Minnesota, first Camp Savage, and then later Fort Snelling. Most of the 6,000 graduates were Japanese American.|$|R

The perception of Standard American English is an important influence on intercultural communicative competence within classroom instruction and determines effective <b>instruction</b> <b>for</b> linguistically diverse <b>speakers,</b> especially African Americans. Examination of language use {{in the classroom and}} its impact on learning is increasingly important if we are {{to meet the needs of}} lower performing students who speak African American English (AAE). Fourteen elementary and middle school urban teachers from a high poverty district were involved in this study, which investigated their perceptions and linguistic knowledge of AAE. During an eight week period the teachers completed surveys, took part in interviews, and were observed during classroom instruction. The data were analyzed utilizing the conceptual model of intercultural communicative competence. This model combined attitudes, knowledge and skills with linguistic, sociolinguistic and discourse competence. This study found that (a) that AAE is still a misunderstood and maligned sector of English, (b) linguistic knowledge did not play a role in instruction and (c) empathy played a key role in the instruction of AAE speaking students. The recommendations for further research include determining the type of training teachers need to solve the problems of linguistic bias towards AAE by involving teachers and pre-service teachers who work with students who speak AAE and the possibility of using intercultural communicative competence as the framework for developing the skill of empathy...|$|R

40|$|An {{analysis}} {{of state and}} national standards demonstrates a need to integrate more meaningful, cultural content in Spanish language <b>instruction</b> <b>for</b> non native <b>speakers.</b> Students complete Spanish course requirements with a limited knowledge of the cultures of Latin America. The curriculum Ventanas is a resource for teachers to provide transformational lessons about culture. Ventanas helps students to broaden their definition of culture {{by the use of}} Spanish song texts from Latin America. This curriculum is based on research by Vygotsky (1962) that shows learning is social, and that thought, language and practice are interrelated. To make sense of a second language, a second language learner must first understand their own cultural frames of reference. Students are better able to comprehend new cultures and differing viewpoints by comparing new knowledge with their prior knowledge. Activities in the curriculum are structured to enrich their cultural knowledge of the second language while reading a song text or other literary texts in Spanish. Ventanas was implemented in a Spanish Four public high school foreign language class during the Spring 2009 school year. Curriculum implementation was evaluated through {{analysis of}} surveys, student work and a culminating project. The results suggest that students were able to develop awareness about the changing and complex concept of culture as they wrote journals, examined song texts, completed an exit survey and wrote song lyrics that expressed a distinct, cultural viewpoint. Students learned about the concept of culture and recognized the importance of understanding their own cultural frames of referenc...|$|R
