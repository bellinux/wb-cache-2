5|$|As before, the MPGA {{supported}} and assisted the new fundraising campaign.

5|$|Despite the announcement, {{the ambitious}} project became {{inactive}} and was finally scrapped after no worthy design was accepted and {{not nearly enough}} of the S$250,000 funds <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised.</b> In 1985, the alumni announced that the funds collected earlier would be rediverted to other projects, such as providing scholarships.|$|E

On arrival, the 1st Airborne Division was reinforced by the 4th Parachute Brigade. The 4th Parachute Brigade had been formed in the Middle East during 1942. In addition to the 156th Parachute Battalion, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> from British troops stationed in India, it comprised the 10th and 11th Parachute Battalions, which <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> from troops based in Egypt and Palestine.|$|E

5|$|Money that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> {{during the}} 1920s and {{financial}} backing from the Rockefeller Foundation helped {{the school to}} survive through the Great Depression.

5|$|Darwin {{summarised}} his speculation in {{his essay}} on the Elevation of Patagonia. Though tentative, it challenged Lyell's ideas. Darwin drew on measurements by the Beagles officers {{as well as his}} own measurements to propose that the plains <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>raised</b> in successive stages by forces acting over a wide area, rather than smaller scale actions in a continuous movement. However, he supported Lyell in finding evidence to dismiss a sudden deluge when normal processes were suddenly speeded. Seashells he had found far inland still showing their colour suggested to him that the process had been relatively recent, and could have affected human history.|$|E
