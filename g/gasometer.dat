5|$|As {{a result}} of the finger spinners' success, Australian captain Ian Johnson tried to convert Davidson into a left arm {{orthodox}} spinner. Davidson returned as Australia faced a fourth meeting with Laker and Lock, in a match against Surrey immediately after the two consecutive Test maulings. On a sticky wicket that played {{into the hands of the}} Surrey spinners, Australia were skittled for 143. Only Davidson, who took the attack to the pair, made 44 not out. One six that he lofted from Laker almost reached the iconic <b>gasometer</b> outside The Oval. The match was drawn, and Davidson took 2/50 including Eric Bedser and Laker in his new role as a slow bowler.|$|E

5000|$|In the U.K. as well {{as other}} European countries, a {{movement}} to preserve classic <b>gasometers</b> has emerged in recent years, especially after Britain's National Grid announced in 2013 their plans to tear down 76 gas holders, and soon afterwards, Southern and Scottish Gas networks announced that they would demolish 111 others. Christopher Costelloe, director of the Victorian Society, a leader in the campaign to preserve the <b>gasometers</b> said, “Gasometers, by their very size and structure, cannot help but become landmarks.

The Lock, Laker, and Peter May south stands were {{to be replaced by}} a new stand, which would have a hotel backing on to it. The Surrey Tavern at the entrance to the ground would be demolished, and a new pedestrian plaza would be created in its place, improving access to the ground and opening up views of the historic pavilion. These plans were delayed by objections raised by the Health & Safety Executive as the ground is close to a <b>gasometer.</b> Planning permission was eventually granted, but not before the credit crunch struck, as a result of which the plans were not proceeded with.|$|E

500|$|In London, in 1814, {{there was}} a single <b>gasometer</b> of , by 1822, there were four gas companies, whose gasometers had a total {{combined}} volume of almost a million ft3 [...] To keep delivery routes for the gas pipelines as short as possible, gas plants were set up within the city districts where the gas was consumed. The arrival {{of these types of}} chemical plants to inhabited parts of the city provoked public criticism of the new technology. This was also directed at poisonous effluent generated by the plant operations. These harsh critiques were especially fierce once accidental explosions occurred at some plants. Accum, who by this point was a leading proponent of gaslight in addition to his work as a chemist, strongly refuted these criticisms in his writings. Through careful analysis he showed that as a whole, accidents were caused by carelessness of plant workerman rather than problems with the technology, and were therefore avoidable.|$|E
