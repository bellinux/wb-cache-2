This proposal was widely supported by the public and politicians. At the start of 1956, in the second session of the 84th Congress, Representative Edith Green (D-Oregon) introduced the Alaska Mental Health Bill (H.R. 6376) in the House of Representatives. The bill had been written by Bob Bartlett, the Congressional Delegate from the Alaska Territory who later became a U.S. Senator. Senator Richard L. Neuberger (D-Oregon) sponsored an equivalent bill, S. 2518, in the Senate.|$|E

It was an {{exciting}} time. A lot of active students wound up in different cities and communities as organizers. I chose Racine, Wisconsin. I spent three years there. We had developed a legal clinic and we had a whole <b>health</b> <b>program,</b> but the city was too small. I had, of course, heard about Uptown in Chicago, and the challenges. So I wound up here in 1976. I waited tables. I did photography, took pictures for attorneys. Ultimately we started our own print shop in order to print our own newspapers and magazines.|$|E

5|$|The bill {{provided}} for a cash grant of $12.5 million (about $94 million at 2007 prices) to be disbursed to the Alaskan {{government in a}} number of phases, to fund the construction of mental health facilities in the territory. To meet the ongoing costs of the program, the bill transferred one million acres (4,000km²) of federally owned land in Alaska to the ownership of the proposed new Alaska Mental Health Trust as a grant-in-aid—the federal government owned about 99% of the land of Alaska at the time. The trust would then {{be able to use the}} assets of the transferred land (principally mineral and forestry rights) to obtain an ongoing revenue stream to fund the Alaskan mental <b>health</b> <b>program.</b> Similar provisions had applied in other US territories to support the provision of public facilities prior to the achievement of statehood.|$|E

40|$|Osteoporosis is {{a serious}} public health concern worldwide, and {{community-based}} public <b>health</b> <b>programs</b> that increase osteoporosis preventive behaviors are ideal to combat this major public health issue. A review of community-based public <b>health</b> <b>programs</b> for osteoporosis prevention show that programs vary in numerous ways and have mixed results in increasing osteoporosis preventive behaviors, although most programs have had success in significantly increasing calcium intake, only a few programs have had success in significantly increasing weight-bearing exercise. Regarding calcium intake, all community-based public <b>health</b> <b>programs</b> that implemented: 1) at least one theoretical behavior change model, such as the health belief model, or 2) bone mineral density (BMD) testing for osteoporosis screening, have shown success in significantly increasing calcium intake. As community-based public <b>health</b> <b>programs</b> for osteoporosis prevention have shown limited success in increasing weight-bearing exercise, an additional review of community-based public <b>health</b> <b>programs</b> incorporating osteoporosis exercise showed that they have high compliance rates to increase weight-bearing exercise, but require high-intensity weight-bearing exercise of 80 – 85 % 1 -repetition maximum to significantly increase BMD to prevent osteoporosis. In the prevention of osteoporosis, for community-based public <b>health</b> <b>programs</b> to be most effective, they should implement theoretical behavior change models and/or BMD testing for osteoporosis screening, along with high-intensity resistance training. Recommendations for future research to further study effective community-based public <b>health</b> <b>programs</b> are also provided...|$|R

Only 13 of the programs engaged in outcomes evaluation. Using the Socioecological Framework, we found that many programs support individual-level and institutional-level changes, but few programs support congregational-level changes.
