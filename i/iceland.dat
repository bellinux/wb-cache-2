5|$|<b>Iceland</b> is {{the first}} {{country in the world}} to create an economy {{generated}} through industries fueled by renewable energy, and there is still a large amount of untapped hydroelectric energy in <b>Iceland.</b> In 2002 it was estimated that <b>Iceland</b> only generated 17% of the total harnessable hydroelectric energy in the country.

5|$|The British commanders {{distributed}} the 1st Provisional Marine Brigade throughout camps around the Reykjavik area, {{to act as}} an emergency force which could quickly counter any German invasion.

The 1st Provisional Marine Brigade troops spent much of their time in <b>Iceland</b> building infrastructure and bases to fortify <b>Iceland</b> against potential German attack. On 22 September, the British division departed <b>Iceland</b> and command was assumed by the United States Army. During the winter of 1941–1942 the brigade saw no combat and spent much of its time attempting to construct fortifications and drill for combat, hampered by a lack of supplies, communications equipment, transportation, and good weather. Aside from the occasional German reconnaissance aircraft, no German forces came to <b>Iceland.</b>|$|E

5|$|After their {{invasion}} in Operation Weserübung, Hitler vowed {{that he would}} never again leave Norway, and favored annexing Denmark as a German province even more due to its small size and relative closeness to Germany. Himmler's hopes were an expansion of the project so that <b>Iceland</b> would also be included among the group of Germanic countries which would have to be gradually incorporated into the Reich. He was also among the group of more esoteric National Socialists who believed either <b>Iceland</b> or Greenland to be the mystical land of Thule, a purported original homeland of the ancient Aryan race. From a military point of view, the Kriegsmarine command hoped to see the Spitsbergen, <b>Iceland,</b> Greenland, the Faroe Isles and possibly the Shetland Isles (which were also claimed by the Quisling regime) under its domination to guarantee German naval access to the mid-Atlantic.|$|E

5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found it {{increasingly}} difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally {{have to ask for}} a loan from the central bank as the lender of last resort. However, in <b>Iceland</b> the banks were so much larger than the national economy that the Central Bank of <b>Iceland</b> and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the Central Bank of <b>Iceland</b> stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E

5|$|Coming {{from a small}} {{domestic}} market, Iceland's {{banks have}} financed their expansion with loans on the interbank lending market and, more recently, by deposits from outside <b>Iceland</b> (which are also a form of external debt).

This inflation was exacerbated by the practice of the Central Bank of <b>Iceland</b> issuing liquidity loans to banks on the basis of newly issued, uncovered bonds – effectively, printing money on demand.|$|E

5|$|Developed from ponies {{taken to}} <b>Iceland</b> by Norse {{settlers}} in the 9th and 10th centuries, the breed is mentioned in literature and historical records throughout Icelandic history; the first reference to a named horse appears in the 12th century. Horses were venerated in Norse mythology, a custom brought to <b>Iceland</b> by the country's earliest settlers. Selective breeding over the centuries has developed the breed into its current form. Natural selection has also played a role, as the harsh Icelandic climate eliminated many horses through cold and starvation. In the 1780s, much of the breed was wiped out {{in the aftermath of}} a volcanic eruption at Laki. The first breed society for the Icelandic horse was created in <b>Iceland</b> in 1904, and today the breed is represented by organizations in 19different nations, organized under a parent association, the International Federation of Icelandic Horse Associations.|$|E
