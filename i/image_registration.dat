25|$|The {{reconstruction}} {{is accomplished}} by a two-step process, first images are aligned to account for errors in the positioning of a sample; such errors can occur due to vibration or mechanical drift. Alignment methods use <b>image</b> <b>registration</b> algorithms, such as autocorrelation methods to correct these errors. Secondly, using a reconstruction algorithm, such as filtered back projection, the aligned image slices can be transformed from a set of two-dimensional images, I'j(x,y), to a single three-dimensional image, Ij(x,y,z). This three-dimensional image {{is of particular interest}} when morphological information is required, further study can be undertaken using computer algorithms, such as isosurfaces and data slicing to analyse the data.|$|E

In Data Assimilation by Field Alignment, Ravela et al. introduce the joint position-amplitude adjustment model using ensembles, and systematically derive a sequential approximation which can be applied to both EnKF and other formulations. Their method does not make the assumption that amplitudes and position errors are independent or jointly Gaussian, as others do. The morphing EnKF employs intermediate states, obtained by techniques borrowed from <b>image</b> <b>registration</b> and morphing, instead of linear combinations of states.|$|E

40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. comRemote-sensing <b>images</b> <b>registration</b> is a fundamental task in image processing, which is concerned with establishment of correspondence between two or more pictures taken, for example, at different times, from different sensors, or from different viewpoints. Because of the different gray level characters in such remote-sensing images, it's difficult to match them automatically. We usually constrain the images to some particular categories, or do the job manually. In this paper, we develop a new algorithm for remote-sensing <b>images</b> <b>registration,</b> which takes {{full advantage of the}} shape information of the close-regions bounded by contours after detecting and linking the edges in images. Based on the shape-specific points of the close-regions, we match the close-regions by evaluating their matching degrees. Using the matched pairs of the close-regions, the geometric parameters for <b>images</b> <b>registration</b> are computed and this registration task can be performed automatically and accurately. This new algorithm works well for those images where the contour information is well preserved, such as the optical images from LANDSAT and SPOT satellites. Experiments verified our algorithm, and showed that the performance of executing it sequentially depends a lot {{on the size of the}} input images. The time complexity will increase exponentially as the size of images increases. So we extend the sequential algorithm to a distributed scheme and perform the registration task more efficiently.

METHODS: Phantom and patient studies {{were performed on}} a Varian TrueBeam STx linear accelerator (version 2. 5), which is integrated with a BrainLab ExacTrac imaging system (version 6. 1. 1). The phantom study {{was based on a}} Rando head phantom and was designed to evaluate isocenter location dependence of the <b>image</b> <b>registrations.</b> Ten isocenters at various locations representing clinical treatment sites were selected in the phantom. Cone-beam computed tomography and ExacTrac X-ray images were taken when the phantom was located at each isocenter. The patient study included 34 patients. Cone-beam computed tomography and ExacTrac X-ray images were taken at each patient 2 ̆ 7 s treatment position. The 6 degree-of-freedom <b>image</b> <b>registrations</b> were performed on cone-beam computed tomography and ExacTrac, and residual errors calculated from cone-beam computed tomography and ExacTrac were compared. RESULTS: In the phantom study, the average residual error differences (absolute values) between cone-beam computed tomography and ExacTrac <b>image</b> <b>registrations</b> were 0. 17 ± 0. 11 mm, 0. 36 ± 0. 20 mm, and 0. 25 ± 0. 11 mm in the vertical, longitudinal, and lateral directions, respectively.
