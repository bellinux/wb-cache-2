5|$|At {{various places}} along the coast, {{large numbers of}} QZ bunkers were built in <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>three,</b> linked to each other by a {{prefabricated}} concrete tunnel. Elsewhere bunkers were constructed in groupings around strategic points across the country, or in lines across swathes of territory. Tirana was particularly heavily defended, with thousands of bunkers radiating out in fifty concentric circles around the city.|$|E

5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} is diurnal (active mainly during the day), though it mainly rests or ruminates in dense undergrowth at noon. Though solitary by nature, the {{four-horned antelope}} may form loose <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> to five. Groups consist {{of one or}} more adults, sometimes accompanied by juveniles.

5|$|After the six 735kV wires {{split up}} into two <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> power lines each, the HVDC line follows the eastern group, {{and the western}} set diverges away. The line remains {{overhead}} until it reaches {{the north shore of}} the Saint Lawrence River near Grondines, where the 450kV HVDC line descends into an underwater tunnel traversing the river. The power line surfaces on the south shore near Lotbinière substation. After the river crossing, the line enters into the Nicolet terminal near Sainte-Eulalie, northeast of Drummondville. South of the terminal, the line heads south and after a relatively short distance, it enters the Des Cantons close to Sherbrooke.|$|E

5|$|As the Ju 87s {{reached the}} coast, the {{respective}} groups split off {{and headed for}} their assigned targets. By this time, some 15 miles off the Isle of Wight, the Bf 109s had caught up and were now zigzagging around the dive-bombers. Bode led III./StG 77 to attack from the northwest, dead into wind in order to bomb accurately. Usually the Ju 87s attacked in line astern, but Bode chose to attack in <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> to split the anti-aircraft fire. To keep the enemy's heads down, he fired his machine guns in an 80-degree dive. He soon left an altitude of 13,000feet, releasing his bombs and pulling out at 2,275feet. The rest of his unit followed.|$|E
5|$|During {{the same}} centuries, rolls of arms {{included}} invented arms for kings of foreign lands (Neubecker, 30). Around 1310, Jacques de Longuyon wrote the Voeux de Paon ("Vows of the Peacock"), {{which included a}} list of nine famous leaders. This list, divided into three <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>three,</b> became known in art and literature as the Nine Worthies (Loomis 1938, 37). Each of the Nine Worthies were given a coat of arms. King David, for instance, was assigned a gold harp as a device (Neubecker, 172).|$|E

At the same time, Jenna Maroney (Jane Krakowski), worried a new actor will steal her spotlight, tries to befriend the TGS staff writers—Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), Toofer Spurlock (Keith Powell), and J.D. Lutz (John Lutz)—to ensure her {{continued}} success.

5|$|Newly hatched Aylesbury ducklings are timid {{and thrive}} best in small groups, so the duckers would divide them into <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> or four ducklings, each {{accompanied}} by a hen. As the ducklings grew older and gained confidence, they would be kept in groups of around 30. Originally the ducks would be kept in every room in the ducker's cottage, but {{towards the end of}} the 19thcentury they were kept in outdoor pens and sheds with suitable protection against cold weather.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 11 April 1975, the 31st MAU received orders to execute Operation Eagle Pull. At 06:00 on 12 April, 12 CH-53s of HMH-462 launched from the deck of USS Okinawa and then at 10-minute intervals descended again {{to pick up their}} marines. Elements of Companies F and H, and the command group embarked from the USS Okinawa while elements of Company G boarded their helicopters on the USS Vancouver, giving a total ground security force of 360 Marines. As the helicopters completed loading they formed into <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> orbiting the task force.|$|E
5|$|Onion domes {{often appear}} in <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>three,</b> {{representing}} the Holy Trinity, or five, representing Jesus Christ and the Four Evangelists. Domes standing alone represent Jesus. Vasily Tatischev, {{the first to}} record such interpretation, disapproved of it emphatically. He believed that the five-domed design of churches was propagated by Patriarch Nikon, who liked to compare the central and highest dome with himself and four lateral domes with four other patriarchs of the Orthodox world. There is no other evidence that Nikon ever held such a view.|$|E

5|$|Similar to {{the other}} majors, the tournament {{consists}} of four rounds at 18 holes each, Thursday through Sunday (when there are no delays). The Masters has a relatively small field of contenders, when compared with other golf tournaments, so the competitors play in <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> {{for the first two}} rounds (36 holes) and the field is not split to start on the 1st and 10th tees, unless weather shortens the available playing time. The tournament is unique in that it is the only major tournament conducted by a private club rather than a national golf organization like the PGA.|$|E
5|$|As {{the bird}} became extinct before {{significant}} field observations could be made, not much {{is known about}} its behaviour. It {{is believed to have}} been a terrestrial species that laid a single egg in an unlined depression in the ground. It roosted in pairs or small <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>three</b> or four in small shrubs and was reportedly very tame, allowing hunters to pick it up off its roost. The Choiseul pigeon lived in lowland forests, particularly in coastal swampy areas that lacked mangroves. It was only recorded by Albert Stewart Meek, who collected six adults and an egg from the northern part of the island in 1904. Despite many subsequent searches, the bird has not been definitively reported since. It {{is believed to have been}} rare when Meek collected his specimens. The indigenous peoples reported that the species was driven to extinction due to the introduction of cats, as the pigeon had never previously confronted a carnivorous mammal on Choiseul. The last unconfirmed report of a Choiseul pigeon was in the early 1940s, and the species is considered extinct.|$|E
5|$|Birds roam {{from the}} forest floor to the canopy, but {{particularly}} favour the middle story. They mostly operate alone, in pairs or <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>three,</b> and {{can also be found}} mixing with long-billed bernierias. Larger flocks do not occur. The nelicourvi weaver is an agile, active species that generally makes a lot of noise. It searches for insects on leaves, and branches, while hanging from vines and twigs. It looks for animals in rolled leaves such as wild ginger Aframomum and along leaf litter, probing crevices, and opening dead stems. It also dismembers flowers to reach the nectar. Mostly, arthropods (beetles, bugs, butterflies, caterpillars, dragonflies, flies, grasshoppers, leafhoppers, stick insects, millipedes and spiders) are consumed, sometimes small vertebrates (lizards and chameleons), next to some nectar, fruit and probably seeds.|$|E
