5|$|The Mackinac Bridge carries I-75 {{across the}} Straits of Mackinac that {{separate}} Michigan's Upper and Lower peninsulas; the straits also form {{the connection between}} Lakes Michigan and Huron. The structure, {{unlike the rest of}} the state highways in Michigan like I-75, is under the maintenance and control of the Mackinac Bridge Authority (MBA). The authority collects a toll from traffic that crosses the bridge, which , is $4 for passenger cars and $5 per axle for commercial vehicles and motorhomes. In addition to cash, the MBA offers a pre-paid debit card option for the payment of tolls. The authority also provides a <b>driver</b> <b>assistance</b> program that will drive vehicles across the bridge at no additional charge; motorists who use the service have a fear of bridges. Because the bridge normally only allows motor vehicles, bicyclists and snowmobiles shuttled across are subject to fees. The authority maintains a small police department to patrol the bridge and escort vehicles across, and a pair of radio station transmitters that broadcast bridge conditions and travel information on AM530 and AM1610.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Many {{factors can}} alter {{the quality of the}} signal {{resulting}} from an optical sensor mounted onboard an automotive vehicle. To be able to detect and quantify these degraded operation conditions while relying only on the signals resulting from sensors themselves is a challenge for the future <b>driver</b> <b>assistances.</b> In this paper, an approach dealing with daytime fog conditions is presented. First of all, daytime fog is modelled and new visibility distances fitting well with daytime fog driving conditions are defined. Then, two methods for computing the visibility range are proposed. Finally, several applications are derived: enhancement of <b>driver</b> <b>assistances,</b> automation of fog beams and intelligent speed alert. Finally, some perspectives for future research directions are indicated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{adverse weather}} conditions, in {{particular}} in daylightfog,thecontrastofimagesgrabbedbyin-vehiclecameras in the visible light range is drastically degraded, which makes the current <b>driver</b> <b>assistances</b> relying on cameras very sensitive to weather conditions. An onboard vision system should take weather effects into account. The effects of daylight fog vary across the scene and are exponential {{with respect to the}} depth of scene points. Because it is not possible in this context to compute the road scene structure beforehand contrary to fixed camera surveillance, a new scheme is proposed. Fog density is first estimated and then used to restore the contrast using a flat world assumption on the segmented free space in front of the moving vehicle. A scene structure is estimated and used to refine the restoration process. Results are presented using sample road scenes under foggy weather and assessed by computing the visibility level enhancement gained by the method. Finally, we show applications to the enhancement in daylight fog of low level algorithms used in advanced camera based <b>driver</b> <b>assistances.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} and analyzes {{an automated}} <b>driver’s</b> <b>assistance</b> system built for two goals: (1) to test how a voice based command (GPS) system and/or traffic lights influence the possible driving variations at T-intersections and (2) {{to reduce the}} number of traffic accidents. This computational study was conducted on a multi user driving simulation environment at Linköping University, Sweden. A total of 48 persons (groups of 4 persons took part in 12 experiments) participated in this study. We selected Post Encroachment Time (PET), speed and acceleration as conflict indicators at the T-intersection to analyze the behavior of the drivers. One of the hypotheses before the conducting experiments, stated that there is no difference in incident rate (PET values) at intersections between sessions based on the voice based command (GPS) assistance system, traffic lights and sessions based on the baseline condition. Another hypothesis referred to the same average variation values in the speed and the acceleration values corresponding to the PET values. We carried out several experiments to verify the validity of our hypotheses. The use of voice based command (GPS) assistance system and traffic light in an automated <b>driver’s</b> <b>assistance</b> system do not seem to have an effect on the driving behavior. It suggests that the driving behavior of the participants was robust across all experimental hypotheses. The ecological validity of the simulator and awareness of the unreal consequences might have lead to this experimental outcome. The validity of the hypotheses can help out in the evaluation and development of an automated intelligent vehicle safety system keeping in view the current safety requirements. status: publishe...|$|R

In input, the system receives images recorded from a camera set aboard a vehicle; as output, it provides warnings and alarms related to the occurrence of selected dangerous events. The analysis of situations and the consequent issuance of alarms is based on the real-time computation of three basic quantities: the speed of the vehicle, its lateral position, and the frontal free space. Data relative to these quantities are collected, interpreted, and displayed on a suitable graphical interface. The system has undergone rather extensive testing on a variety of situations. Experiments performed to assess the reliability of the low-level processing modules are reported and discussed, and directions for future work are finally outlined...|$|R

40|$|More {{and more}} drivers {{nowadays}} enjoy the convenience brought by advanced <b>driver</b> <b>assistances</b> system (ADAS) including collision detection, lane keeping and ACC. However, many assistant functions are still constrained by weather and terrain. In the way towards automated driving, {{the need of}} an automatic condition detector is inevitable, since many solutions only work for certain conditions. When it comes to camera, which is most commonly used tool in lane detection, obstacle detection, visibility estimation is one of such important parameters we need to analyze. Although many papers have proposed their own ways to estimate visibility range, there is little research {{on the question of}} how to estimate the confidence of an image. In this thesis, we introduce a new way to detect visual distance based on a monocular camera, and thereby we calculate the overall image confidence. Much progresses has been achieved in the past ten years from restoration of foggy images, real-time fog detection to weather classification. However, each method has its own drawbacks, ranging from complexity, cost, and inaccuracy. According to these considerations, the new way we proposed to estimate visibility range is based on a single vision system. In addition, this method can maintain a relatively robust estimation and produce a more accurate result...|$|R
