Recovered engorged larvae were allowed to molt to nymphs and held in an incubator at 23 °C and 85 - 90 % RH. Subsequent flat nymphs were tested for rickettsial infection by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Concomitant infestations with sibling ticks on noninfected <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> (<b>control)</b> were done. While 10 - 60 % of the A. cajennense nymphs were shown to be infected by R. rickettsii, both A. aureolatum and R. sanguineus were highly susceptible to R. rickettsii, since 80 - 100 % of their nymphs were shown to be infected in the corresponding trials. Most of the engorged larvae (70 - 95 %), regardless of being infected or not, successfully molted to nymphs.

Objective: This study is aimed at evaluating the biocompatibility of alpha-tricalcium phosphate bone cement in the obliteration of the mastoid cavity in <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs.</b> Methods: 20 <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> were submitted to surgical procedure. In 10 cement study group animals, the tympanic bulla was obliterated with alpha-tricalcium phosphate bone cement and in 10 <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> (<b>control</b> group), the cavity was left unfilled.

We have investigated {{the relationship between the}} PLL gene and the GA and GT immune response genes by simultaneously immunizing random-bred Hartley strain <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> with GA and PLL, GT and PLL, or GA and GT. In most Hartley <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> the ability to respond immunologically to GA and to PLL is inherited together; that is, most animals responding to GA respond to PLL and vice versa. However, a few animals respond to either GA or to PLL but not both, demonstrating that the GA and PLL immune response genes are not identical but linked in most Hartley animals. Conversely, when simultaneously immunized with GT and PLL, most Hartley <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> respond to either PLL or GT but not both, indicating that GT and PLL responsiveness tends to segregate away from each other. Thus, the GT and PLL immune response genes also are not inherited independently but, rather, behave as alleles or pseudoalleles. Similar results are observed when Hartley <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> are simultaneously immunized with GA and GT. The ability to respond to GA segregates away from the ability to respond to GT. Our studies demonstrated that the specific immune response genes thus far identified in <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> <b>controlling</b> the ability to respond to GA, GT, and PLL, respectively, are found on the same chromosome.

In this study, we used a newly described flow cytometric technique to monitor changes in cell populations accumulating in the lungs and lymph nodes of naïve and vaccinated <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> challenged by low-dose aerosol infection with virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis. As anticipated, vaccinated <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> <b>controlled</b> the growth of the challenge infection more efficiently than controls did. This early phase of bacterial control in immune animals was associated with increased accumulation of CD 4 and CD 8 T cells, including cells expressing the activation marker CD 45, as well as macrophages expressing class II major histocompatibility complex molecules. As the infection continued, the numbers of T cells in the lungs of vaccinated animals waned, whereas the numbers of these cells expressing CD 45 increased. Whereas BCG vaccination reduced the influx of heterophils (neutrophils) into the lungs, an early B-cell influx was observed in these vaccinated animals. Overall, vaccine protection was associated with reduced pathology and lung damage in the vaccinated animals. These data provide the first direct evidence that BCG vaccination accelerates the influx of protective T-cell and macrophage populations into the infected lungs, diminishes the accumulation of nonprotective cell populations, and reduces the severity of lung pathology...|$|R

We conclude that changes in dietary vitamin D are associated with alterations in some cellular immune functions but may not be an important determinant of disease outcome in pulmonary tuberculosis, as has been suggested previously...|$|R

After incubation for 1 h at 37 #{ 176 }C, formation of [HJacyl-PAF from either [3 H]lyso-PAF or [3 H]PAF increased significantly in PMNs from infected <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> com-pared to <b>control</b> PMNs. Furthermore, total radioactivity from [3 H]lyso-PAF or [3 H]PAF was higher in PMNs from infected animals {{than in those}} from controls. How-ever, compared to PAF production by control PMNs, production of PAF by infected PMNs was unchanged.

40|$|Objective: To {{explore the}} effects of Yanggan Lidan Granule (YGLDG), a {{compound}} traditional Chinese herbal medicine for nourishing liver and improving choleresis, on the rate of gallstone formation and content of plasma cholecystokinin in <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> with induced cholesterol gallstones. Methods: Eighty <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> were randomly divided into 4 groups, which were normal control group, untreated group, YGLDG-treated group and ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) -treated group (n= 20). Except the normal control group, gallstones were induced by high-cholesterol diet in the <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs.</b> YGLDG (1. 81 g/kg daily) and UDCA (30. 12 mg/kg daily) were given orally to <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> in the corresponding group respectively for seven weeks; however, the <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> of normal <b>control</b> group and untreated group were administered with normal saline. The physical signs of the <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> and the rates of gallstone formation were examined, {{and the content of}} cholecystokinin (CCK) in the plasma was detected by radio-immunoassay. Results: YGLDG could obviously improve the ethological signs of the <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs.</b> Gallstone formation rate of the untreated group (82. 35 %) was significantly increased as compared with that of the normal control group (5. 26 %) (P 0. 05).

40|$|Genes in {{the major}} {{histocompatibility}} complex of mice and <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> <b>control</b> immunologic responsiveness to insulins from other animal species. In order to determine if similar genetic control exists in man, we have examined lymphocyte proliferation responses to components of therapeutic insulins by employing lymphocytes from diabetic patients that receive insulin. Distinct groups of individuals demonstrated positive lymphocyte proliferative responses to beef insulin, beef and pork insulin, beef proinsulin, pork proinsulin, and protamine. Lymphocytes from the patient population were typed for the HLA-A, B, C, and DR antigens. An increased frequency of certain HLA antigens was found in those individuals that responded to the following therapeutic insulin components: beef, HLA-DR 4; beef and pork, HLA-DR 3; beef proinsulin, HLA-BW 4, CW 2, CW 5, DR 2, and DR 5; protamine, HLA-CW 3, CW 5, and DR 7. The results demonstrate that the human immune system recognized the structural differences between human and beef and/or pork insulin. These differences are two amino acids in the A chain, alpha loop, of beef insulin and the single terminal amino acid, alanine, which is common to pork and beef insulins. Positive responses to both beef proinsulin and pork proinsulin demonstrated the capability of restricted recognition of more complex proteins represented by the C-peptide in these insulin preparations. Lymphocyte proliferative responses to protamine were also restricted, which suggests a genetic control to this antigen. The association of these responses with HLA alloantigens strongly suggests that genes within the human major histocompatibility complex control recognition and lymphocyte response to therapeutic insulin components...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{premature}} weaning at {{two days of}} age on cholesterol and lipoprotein metabolism were studied in adult <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs.</b> Both normally (<b>control)</b> and prematurely weaned <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> were fed a non-purified diet (basal diet). At 8 weeks of age control and prematurely weaned animals were divided into three groups, and were fed either the basal diet, or basal diet containing either 0. 25 % cholesterol or 1. 1 % cholestyramine for 4 weeks. Prematurely weaned <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> fed the basal diet as adults exhibited a significant increase of 1. 7 -fold in hepatic 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl CoA (HMG-CoA) reductase activity and a 1. 4 -fold increase in plasma cholesterol levels, mainly in the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) fraction (P < 0. 05). In addition, the number of LDL receptors of hepatic membranes was significantly reduced by 56 % in prematurely weaned <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> compared to <b>controls.</b> Mass ratios of core (triglyceride and cholesteryl ester) to surface (free cholesterol, protein, and phospholipid) components of LDL were significantly higher in the prematurely weaned animals relative to normally weaned animals (P < 0. 05). However, there was no change in particle size with variation in treatment. In vitro incubation of LDL with high density lipoprotein and cholesterol ester transfer protein demonstrated a 2 -fold increase in cholesteryl esters transferred to LDL in the prematurely weaned animals compared to controls. Addition of dietary cholesterol increased plasma and hepatic cholesterol levels, and decreased hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity and receptor-mediated LDL binding in the control animals. In contrast, prematurely weaned animals did not show {{a significant increase in}} plasma cholesterol levels. Cholestyramine intake decreased plasma cholesterol in the normally weaned but not in prematurely weaned <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs.</b> Premature weaning resulted in a significant reduction in hepatic cholesterol levels in animals fed cholestyramine. Receptor-mediated LDL binding increased in animals fed cholestyramine compared to animals fed the basal diet and premature weaning did not alter this response. These data indicate that premature weaning alters in vivo cholesterol metabolism of adult <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> resulting in increased plasma cholesterol levels, hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity and CETP activity, and decreased levels of hepatic LDL receptors. Premature weaning also alters the regulatory responses to feedback suppression and metabolic induction of plasma lipoprotein cholesterol metabolism...|$|R
40|$|This study {{establishes}} the immune response elicited in <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> after pulmonary and parenteral immunizations with diphtheria CRM- 197 antigen (CrmAg). Several spray-dried powders of formalin-treated/untreated CrmAg nanoaggregates with L-leucine were {{delivered to the}} lungs of <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs.</b> A <b>control</b> group consisting of alum with adsorbed CrmAg in saline was administered by intramuscular injection. Animals received three doses of powder vaccines containing 20 or 40  μg of CrmAg. The serum IgG titers were measured for 16  weeks after the initial immunization; IgA titers were measured {{at the time of}} sacrifice in the broncho-alveolar lavage fluid. Further, toxin neutralization tests in naïve <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> were performed for a few select serum samples. Histopathology of the lung tissues was conducted to evaluate inflammation or injury to the lung tissues. While the highest titer of serum IgG antibody was observed in <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> immunized by the intramuscular route, those animals immunized with dry powder formulation by the pulmonary route, and without the adjuvant alum, exhibited high IgA titers. A pulmonary administered dry powder, compared to parenteral immunization, conferred complete protection in the toxin neutralization test. Mild inflammation was observed in lung tissues of animals receiving dry powder vaccines by the pulmonary route. Thus, administering novel CrmAg as dry powders to the lungs may be able to overcome some of the disadvantages observed with the existing diphtheria vaccine which is administered by the parenteral route. In addition, these powders will have the advantage of eliciting a high mucosal immune response in the lungs without using traditional adjuvants...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To derive {{pharmacokinetic}} {{data for}} 3 amikacin dosing regimens in <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> {{and to determine}} whether the antibacterial activity of 15 mg/kg of body weight given twice daily is equivalent to administering the drug more frequently. ANIMALS: 10 <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> in pharmacokinetic trials, and 10 <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> in pretreatment, <b>control,</b> and amikacin treatment groups. PROCEDURE: Amikacin pharmacokinetic data were determined in <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> after single i. m. administration of 3. 75, 7. 5 and 15 mg/kg. <b>Guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> had been made neutropenic by treatment with cyclophosphamide. All <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> were inoculated with 2. 8 x 10 (8) colony-forming units (CFU) of Escherichia coli in the thigh muscle, then were allotted to 5 groups: pretreatment (euthanized 4 hours after inoculation), control, and 3 amikacin treatment groups (3. 75 mg/kg, q 3 h; 7. 5 mg/kg, q 6 h; and 15 mg/kg, q 12 h). Amikacin administration was begun 4 hours after E coli inoculation and was continued for 72 hours. Numbers of E coli CFU in infected thigh muscle were determined for each <b>guinea</b> <b>pig.</b> RESULTS: Difference in survival between control and the amikacin-treated groups was significant. The E coli infection concentration (log 10 CFU) increased significantly in the control, compared with the pretreatment, group. Infection concentration decreased significantly in all treatment groups, compared with the pretreatment group. There {{was no significant difference in}} bacterial killing among the 3 treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Amikacin had a significant effect on survival of neutropenic <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> with E coli infection.

MethodsGroups of BALB/c mice were immunized intramuscularly three times at 10 -day intervals with AEC/BC 02 or the adjuvant alone and the vaccine-induced cell-mediated immune responses were evaluated. The efficacy of AEC/BC 02 was evaluated in two <b>guinea</b> <b>pig</b> models, one a model of prevention {{and the other a}} model of latent infection. ResultsThe AEC/BC 02 vaccine induced strong cellular immune responses characterized by a high frequency of antigen-specific interferon-γ-secreting T cells in mice at different time points after the last vaccination. In the preventive model of <b>guinea</b> <b>pig,</b> AEC/BC 02 did not protect against Mycobacterium tuberculosis as a pre-exposure vaccine. However, in a latent infection model of <b>guinea</b> <b>pig,</b> it effectively <b>controlled</b> the reactivation of M. tuberculosis and lowered the bacterial load in the lung and spleen.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the current study was to {{evaluate}} hydrogen-saturated saline protecting intensive narrow band noise-induced hearing loss. <b>Guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> were divided into three groups: hydrogen-saturated saline; normal saline; and control. For saline administration, the <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> were given daily abdominal injections (1 ml/ 100 g) 3 days before and 1 h before narrow band noise exposure (2. 5 – 3. 5 kHz 130 dB SPL, 1 h). The <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> in the <b>control</b> group received no treatment. The hearing function was assessed by the auditory brainstem response (ABR) and distortion product otoacoustic emission (DPOAE) recording. The changes of free radicals in the cochlea before noise exposure, and immediately and 7 days after noise exposure were also examined. By Scanning electron microscopy and succinate dehydrogenase staining, we found that pre-treatment with hydrogen-saturated saline significantly reduced noise-induced hair cell damage and hearing loss. We also found that the malondialdehyde, lipid peroxidation, and hydroxyl levels were significantly lower in the hydrogen-saturated saline group after noise trauma, indicating that hydrogen-saturated saline can decrease the amount of harmful free radicals caused by noise trauma.

Five groups (A-E) of 5 <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> (1 <b>control</b> per group) at 42 days of gestation were inoculated with laboratory isolates of Cfv via intra-peritoneal (IP) injection. Groups A, B, C, D and E were injected with five different isolates; Q 41 at 8. 4 x 107 cfu/ml, 258 at 1 x 108 cfu/ml, 540 at 1 x 108 cfu/ml, 540 at 1. 2 x 104 cfu/ml and 540 at 3. 3 x 107 cfu/ml respectively. Tissues from dams and aborted foetuses were examined using culture and histology. The study was approved by the University of Queensland Animal Ethics Committee. Group B had an abortion rate of 100 % and groups C and E had abortion rates of 75 % within a time period of 19 – 168 hours while Group A produced no abortions within 7 days of IP injection. The occurrence of Cfv isolated from peritoneum, uterus horns, placental sites, amniotic fluid and foetal stomach content varied. One dam in Group D aborted one foetus. No control animals aborted and Cfv was not isolated in Group D and the controls. Histology results showed tissue changes associated with placentitis, suggesting that Cfv induces inflammation, placental detachment and abortion. Strain virulence variation appears to be present.

Whole-lung lavage was performed also in unexposed <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> as <b>controls.</b> The number of lavaged cells was low 1 week after exposure, but exceeded control levels 4 weeks after exposure and remained elevated thereafter. The percentage of polymorphonuclear leukocytes was high 1 and 8 weeks after exposure, and that of macrophages was high 4 weeks after exposure. The iron-loading rate of alveolar macrophages was 0 % in controls. It was elevated above 90 % 1 week after exposure and remained elevated thereafter. Chemotaxis to zymosan activated serum and random migration of alveolar macrophages were maximal 1 week after exposure and were significantly greater (p< 0. 001) than with controls at all times. The chemotactic differential and chemotactic index were significantly low 4 and 8 weeks after exposure (p< 0. 05, p< 0. 001), {{compared with those of}} controls.

40|$|In humans, {{respiratory}} viral infections lead {{to increased}} airway responsiveness and exacerbations of asthma. In the present study, the role of interleukin- 5 (IL- 5) in virus-induced airway hyperresponsiveness and inflammation was examined in <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs.</b> In animals treated with control antibody, parainfluenza- 3 virus significantly potentiated (219 %) the histamine-induced increase in lung resistance compared with vehicle treatment. In addition, viral infection significantly increased (130 to 450 %) the responsiveness of isolated tracheal segments to histamine in animals treated with <b>control</b> antibody. In <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> treated with <b>control</b> antibody, the numbers of eosinophils (226 %), neutrophils (1, 380 %), and monocytes (626 %) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were significantly increased after viral infection. The level of major basic protein in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid was not altered after viral infection. In addition, electron microscopic examination of eosinophils in airway tissue and alveolar lumen did not point to increased degranulation after viral infection. In <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> treated with antibody to IL- 5 the virus-induced airway hyperresponsiveness to histamine both in vivo and in vitro was almost completely inhibited. In <b>guinea</b> <b>pigs</b> treated with anti-IL- 5, viral infection significantly increased the numbers of eosinophils (234 %), neutrophils (1, 255 %), and monocytes (617 %) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid.
