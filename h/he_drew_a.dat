5|$|A 19th-century ethnographic account {{from eastern}} Herzegovina {{describes}} a way through {{which a man}} who was not born as a zduhać could become one. Forty days after he ceased praying to God and washing his face, the man should go to some level ground, before <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> circle on the ground and sat in its centre. Soon the Devil would come and ask the man whether he was willing to join his army, and what form he wanted to be transformed into. When the man stated the desired form, the Devil would turn him into that, making him a zduhać. In the region of Semberija, northeast Bosnia, а zduhać could pass his supernatural power on to his son.|$|E
5|$|Leonardo {{had many}} {{friends who are}} now renowned either in their fields or for their {{historical}} significance. They included the mathematician Luca Pacioli, with whom he collaborated on the book De divina proportione in the 1490s. Leonardo appears to have had no close relationships with women except for his friendship with Cecilia Gallerani and the two Este sisters, Beatrice and Isabella. While on a journey that took him through Mantua, <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> portrait of Isabella {{that appears to have}} been used to create a painted portrait, now lost.|$|E
5|$|The {{views of}} Winckelmann on art {{encompassed}} {{the entirety of}} civilisation. <b>He</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> parallel between a civilisation's general level of development {{and the evolution of}} its art. He interpreted this artistic evolution the same way that his contemporaries saw the life cycle of a civilisation, in terms of progress, apogee and then decline. For him, Greek art had been the pinnacle of artistic achievement, culminating with Phidias. Further, Winckelmann believed that the most beautiful works of Greek art had been produced under ideal geographic, political and religious circumstances. This frame of thought long dominated intellectual life in Europe. He classified Greek art into four periods: Ancient (archaic period), Sublime (Phidias), Beautiful (Praxiteles) and Decadent (Roman period).|$|E

5000|$|Born {{and raised}} in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, Fluevog {{spent much of his}} youth at his father's {{drive-in}} ice cream parlour. During this time, he developed a passion for cars, which in turn has provided inspiration for many of his shoe designs. As his company's website declares, [...] "When <b>he's</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> shoe, <b>he's</b> thinking about a car and, when <b>he's</b> <b>drawing</b> <b>a</b> car, <b>he's</b> thinking about a shoe".|$|R
5|$|Hester {{finished}} {{the season with}} six kicks returned for touchdowns, which set a league record. He {{finished the}} season ranking fourth on the League’s all-time combined kick return list, behind Brian Mitchell (13), Eric Metcalf (12), and Dante Hall (12). Additionally, he amassed 299 yards on twenty receptions as a receiver, though he was often used as a decoy. His play on offense received mixed commentary. While the Bears’ coaching staff believed Hester showed enough progress {{to become one of}} the team's top receivers in 2008, Hester was prone to making small errors, including running routes incorrectly or dropping catches. <b>He</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> fifteen-yard facemask penalty while attempting to fend off a would-be tackler in a game against the Saints, and received a $5,000 fine. Nevertheless, Hester concluded the season with four Player of the Week Awards, giving him a franchise-high total of seven in his career, and an invitation to the 2008 Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|His {{record in}} matches was equally impressive: at Berlin in 1890 <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> short {{play-off}} match against his brother Berthold; and won all his other matches from 1889 to 1893, mostly against top-class opponents: Curt von Bardeleben (1889; ranked 9th {{best player in}} the world by Chessmetrics at that time), Jacques Mieses (1889; ranked 11th), Henry Edward Bird (1890; then 60 years old; ranked 29th), Berthold Englisch (1890; ranked 18th), Joseph Henry Blackburne (1892, without losing a game; Blackburne was aged 51 then, but still 9th in the world), Jackson Showalter (1892–93; 22nd) and Celso Golmayo Zúpide (1893; 29th). Chessmetrics calculates that Emanuel Lasker became the world's strongest player in mid-1890, and {{that he was in the}} top ten from the very beginning of his recorded career in 1889.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, facing {{financial}} collapse, Bain & Company asked Romney to return. Announced as its new CEO in January 1991, <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> symbolic {{salary of}} one dollar (remaining managing general partner of Bain Capital during this time). He oversaw {{an effort to}} restructure Bain & Company's employee stock-ownership plan and real-estate deals, while rallying the firm's one thousand employees, imposing a new governing structure that excluded Bain and the other founding partners from control, and increasing fiscal transparency. He got Bain and other initial owners who had removed excessive amounts of money from the firm to return substantial amounts, and persuaded creditors, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to accept less than full payment. Within about a year, he had led Bain & Company to a return to profitability. He turned Bain & Company over to new leadership and returned to Bain Capital in December 1992.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1740s, the South Carolina provincial half-galley Beaufort was {{stationed}} in a cove at {{the southern tip of}} Hilton Head to guard against intrusions by the Spanish of St. Augustine. The point and cove are named after Captain David Cutler Braddock, commander of the Beaufort. Captain Braddock was a mariner and privateer of note in Colonial times. Earlier, he had been placed in command of the Georgia schooner Norfolk by James Oglethorpe, founder of Georgia, and helped chase the Spanish back to St. Augustine after their failed 1742 invasion of St. Simons Island. After relocating to Savannah in 1746, he served two terms in the Georgia Commons House of Assembly while earning a living as a highly active privateer. <b>He</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> well-known chart of the Florida Keys while on a privateering venture in 1756. The chart is in the Library of Congress.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, on September 19, 1827, Bowie and Wright {{attended a}} duel on a sandbar outside of Natchez, Mississippi. Bowie supported duellist Samuel Levi Wells III, while Wright supported Wells's opponent, Dr. Thomas Harris Maddox. The duellists each fired two shots and, as neither {{man had been}} injured, resolved their duel with a handshake. Other members of the groups, who had various reasons for disliking each other, began fighting. Bowie {{was shot in the}} hip; after regaining his feet <b>he</b> <b>drew</b> <b>a</b> knife, described as a butcher knife, and charged his attacker, who hit Bowie over the head with his empty pistol, breaking the pistol and knocking Bowie to the ground. Wright shot at and missed the prone Bowie, who returned fire and possibly hit Wright. Wright then drew his sword cane and impaled Bowie. When Wright attempted to retrieve his blade by placing his foot on Bowie's chest and tugging, Bowie pulled him down and disemboweled Wright with his large knife. Wright died instantly, and Bowie, with Wright's sword still protruding from his chest, was shot again and stabbed by another member of the group. The doctors who had been present for the duel removed the bullets and patched Bowie's other wounds.|$|E
