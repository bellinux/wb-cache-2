40|$|The {{success of}} a {{software}} project {{is dependent on the}} expertise and knowledge of its developers. In this dissertation, we use empirical studies to develop an understanding of the impact of knowledge loss on software projects. First, we studied the damage done to projects from turnover, the susceptibility of the project to future turnover, and the suggestion of potential successors to assume abandoned files. Based on the project vulnerability to turnover, project leaders can induce key developers to stay with the project and to mitigate files abandonment. Second, we did an empirical research on the impact of turnover on the quality of a software project. Third, we performed an examination of the impact of <b>inactive</b> <b>files</b> (dormant files). Our findings on the first research topic showed that the greater the spread of knowledge the less likely a project is to be affected by turnover. Moreover, we found that knowledgeable developers, rather than newcomers, take over abandoned code. In our second study, we observed an unexpected result that in the Chrome web-browser project, the number of developers who leave and join both decreased the number of post-release defects. We discuss this unexpected result. The third study on dormant <b>files,</b> i. e. <b>inactive</b> <b>files,</b> contrasted a legacy system with a popular system. We found that for a legacy system, the developers that take on dormant files were experienced developers...|$|R

40|$|There {{are several}} errors {{encountered}} during patients preparation and positioning, this study focus on six of these errors, including palatoglossal air space above the apices {{of the root}} of maxillary teeth, slumped position, chin tipped up, or down, {{as well as the}} patient placed either too far backward or forward, the presence of any of these errors alone or in combination with each other will affect the diagnostic usefulness of the panoramic radiograph. 500 panoramic radiographs were randomly selected from <b>inactive</b> <b>files</b> of adult dentate patients seen at the dental school taken by trained technician. The radiographs were numbered and reviewed by the author under standard viewing conditions to identify the presence of these six errors. Out of 500 panoramic radiographs examined, 468 (93. 6 %) showed one or more than one errors. The most common positioning error encountered was palatoglossal air space above the apices of the root of maxillary teeth 81. 8 %, followed by slumped position 17. 2 %. The percentage is dropped in the others errors to be between 10 – 11. 6 %. The high rate of errors occurred in this study {{can be attributed to the}} lake of verbal communication between the patients and the technicians. This dictates a need of continuing education program for the technicians in panoramic dental radiography. King Saud Universit...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: 2 ̆ 2 In many {{computer}} systems today, users don 2 ̆ 7 t have enough disk space and would welcome {{a method that}} made more efficient use of disk. It has long been hoped that compression {{could be used to}} increase the ammount of user data stored per gigabyte of disk; thus far, attempts to use compression have enjoyed only limited success due to performance degradation, increased hardware cost, or difficulty of implementation. We present and evaluate a method of using compression that does not suffer from the usual drawbacks. The idea is to have the filesystem separate disk storage into two levels of the memory hierarchy. Files that have not been used recently are compressed, while other files are kept in standard uncompressed form. In this way, the concepts of caching and compression are used to split a single disk into two levels of storage with different cost and performance characteristics. <b>Inactive</b> <b>files</b> are stored more cheaply, but take longer to access. We call this the ATTIC method. It is shown that this approach yields an increase in storage capacity nearly as great as that which could be achieved by compressing every file, with nearly the speed of a filesystem that does no compression. Data is presented showing the long term temporal locality of file accesses for 9 systems from 3 different sites. This locality is what makes file migration practical. An analysis of the performance of compression algorithms is presented. Data compressibility and file access patterns vary from machine to machine, but for many systems, the ATTIC approach would result in twice the effective storage capacity while averaging less than 10 seconds of additional delay per user per day. ATTIC has significant advantages over previous methods. It results in much greater storage capacity than a standard filesystem. It does not require any extra hardware. Once implemented, it can be easily added to existing systems. The compression of files is invisible to users, except for the increased storage and a slight degradation in performance. 2 ̆...|$|R
