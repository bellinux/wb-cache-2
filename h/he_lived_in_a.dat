5|$|An {{apartment}} on the 16th and 17th floors has been the official residence of the premier of Quebec since 2001. These two floors, the highest habitable ones since the 18th floor is taken up by machinery, had originally been reserved for a CDP executive suite. There had been a previous attempt at offering the premier an official residence. In 1994, the Quebec City Chamber of Commerce had bought a large residence at 1080 rue des Braves and donated it to then premier Jacques Parizeau. There were issues of security and neighbour relationships, however, and Lucien Bouchard declined to use it. <b>He</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> small {{apartment on}} Parliament Hill {{for most of his}} mandate.|$|E

The success of his company made Washington wealthy, and <b>he</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> mansion in Brooklyn and then moved to a country estate in New Jersey in 1927. In that same year, he lost a dispute with the tax authorities. Washington was married and had three children.|$|E

After the Invasion of Poland and the start of World War II in September 1939, Hitler made Hess second in line to succeed him, after Hermann Göring.

5|$|Hines was traumatised by his {{experiences}} during World War I. For 40 years afterwards <b>he</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> humpy made of cloth bags near Mount Druitt {{on the outskirts}} of Sydney, and never married. The humpy was surrounded by a fence on which he hung helmets taken from German soldiers; he became well known to locals, though school children were afraid of him. Hines was unable to find consistent work, and lived on his Army pension as well as income from odd jobs and selling his souvenirs. He gained renewed fame when the photo of him at Polygon Wood was displayed at the temporary Australian War Museum in Sydney (the predecessor of the Australian War Memorial) from 1933, and several newspapers and magazines aimed at former servicemen published profiles of him. An article in the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia's magazine Reveille in 1934 highlighted Hines' desperate living conditions and stated that he had been unemployed for four years. Several former soldiers sent money to him in response to this article. Hines' pension was also doubled, though this income made him ineligible for relief work during the Great Depression. Despite his poverty, Hines travelled to Concord Repatriation Hospital each week to donate a suitcase of vegetables from his garden to the former soldiers being treated there.|$|E

Treloar continued to work long hours in the years after the war. <b>He</b> <b>lived</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> cubby hole next to his office and signed the attendance book while walking from bed to his desk. Bean later claimed that Treloar had personally managed all areas of the Memorial other than its library. While Dawn provided him with company, family members and AWM staff believed that Treloar was lonely and did not have a social life. His letters to the official artists engaged by the AWM were frequently relaxed, however, and he became friends with Leslie Bowles and William Dargie. While Treloar was a teetotaler and non-smoker, he occasionally shared wine and cigarettes with Dargie.|$|E
