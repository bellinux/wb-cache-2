40|$|Following the {{description}} by Eisenmenger in 1897 of a cyanosed man, aged 32, with a ventricular septal defect and <b>dextroposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aorta without pulmonary stenosis, Abbott (1927) termed this <b>the</b> Eisenmenger type <b>of</b> congenital anomaly. Since that time {{a diagnosis of}} Eisenmenger's complex has become well established for those rare cases of cyanotic congenital heart disease with ventricular septal defect and <b>dextroposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aorta without pulmonary stenosis. Although {{it may be difficult}} to differentiate this complex anatomically from ventricular septal defect with pulmonary hypertension and right ventricular hypertrophy on the one hand, and from partial transposition <b>of</b> <b>the</b> great vessels with overriding aorta on the other, it appears worthwhile preserving the term Eisenmenger's complex as a diagnosis in cyanosed patients with an overriding aorta but without pulmonary stenosis. Clinical, electrocardiographic, and radiological findings in seven such patients are presented below together with <b>the</b> results <b>of</b> angiocardiography and cardiac catheterization. Autopsy findings were available in one patient. These patients were selected according to the criteria described above, but it became obvious from further examination that they all had in addition clinical evidence of pulmonary hypertension. Indeed, the clinical picture common to all patients with Eisenmenger's complex is one of cyanotic congenital heart disease with pulmonary hypertension...|$|R
40|$|In 1888, Etienne Fallot {{described}} {{the last two}} components of Fallot’s tetralogy: right ventricular hypertrophy and <b>dextroposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aorta over septal defect.

40|$|In 1888 the French {{physician}} Etienne-Louis Arthur Fallot {{described a}} “tetrad” of congenital anatomical defects in a heart, {{which are now}} collectively referred to as tetralogy of Fallot (TF).

40|$|Objective: Mitotically active {{leiomyoma}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> complicated with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding {{has never}} been reported in Taiwan. Here, we present a case of mitotically active leiomyoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> complicated with postmenopausal vaginal bleeding in a breast cancer patient who had been receiving tamoxifen for 2 years Case Report: A 56 -year-old woman visited our clinic due to abnormal vaginal spotting for 3 months. This patient had been menopausal for about 6 years without hormone replacement therapy. She had been suffering from breast cancer, had undergone conservative breast surgery, and had been taking tamoxifen (20 mg/day) for 2 years. Pelvic ultrasound was performed and revealed an 8. 9 × 7. 7 cm uterine mass. After simple total hysterectomy, we found an enlarged uterus with a mass over the posterior wall. Final pathology demonstrated a mitotically active leiomyoma, adenomyosis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus,</b> and proliferation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> endometrium. Conclusion: Endometrial cancer is rarely noted in breast cancer patients taking tamoxifen. Further, none have reported mitotically active leiomyoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus.</b> From this case, endometrial proliferation and mitotically active leiomyoma <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>uterus</b> {{may be related to}} tamoxifen therapy, and should not be neglected in breast cancer patients...|$|R
