40|$|Abstract. Accurately {{measuring}} {{capacitive current}} for the automatic tuning arc-suppression coil is the premise and basis of realizing its compensating and arc-extinguishing functions. Several principles measuring capacitive current applied widely are theoretically analyzed and compared. The resonance method {{to measure the}} capacitive current has high precision, but has complex tuning. The displacement voltage method has simple tuning, but has poor accuracy of measuring capacitive current. The measurement accuracy of the <b>impedance</b> <b>triangle</b> method and the E 0 measurement method lies between the resonance method and displacement voltage method. And its tuning is also relatively simple, but its measurement and control system is more complex. At last, to choose appropriate capacitive current measurement method according to the arc-suppression coil tuning principle and the distribution network operation is pointed out...|$|E
