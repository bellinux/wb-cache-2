Cultural sensitivities, especially concerning race and religion, are the main obstacles to the implementation of religious freedom in Malaysia. Great care is taken not to impinge on the religious sensitivities of various groups. Given the fact that Islam is the official religion, care is taken not to publish articles that cast a slur, intended or otherwise, on the religion or its adherents. All the media, including those operated by the opposition, follow this policy. Malays, by constitutional definition, are Muslims and with the inclusion of some aspects of Chinese, Indian, and tribal culture, and no media can carry articles that question the faith or ridicule it. Thus, religious expression has always been monitored by the government in order to protect the racial harmony in multiracial-multicultural society in Malaysia.
