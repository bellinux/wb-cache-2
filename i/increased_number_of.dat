5|$|A {{laboratory}} diagnosis is usually made based on recovery of poliovirus from a stool sample or a swab of the pharynx. Antibodies to poliovirus can be diagnostic, and are generally {{detected in the}} blood of infected patients early in the course of infection. Analysis of the patient's cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), which is collected by a lumbar puncture ("spinal tap"), reveals an <b>increased</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> white blood cells (primarily lymphocytes) and a mildly elevated protein level. Detection of virus in the CSF is diagnostic of paralytic polio, but rarely occurs.|$|E

5|$|By {{the end of}} {{the year}} the Americans felt that they were better {{prepared}} to deliver destruction to the trail system. During Commando Hunt III (1 November 1969 to 30 April 1970), the Air Force claimed that 6,428 enemy trucks destroyed and another 3,604 damaged. 60 aircraft were shot down during this phase of the campaign by an estimated 743 anti-aircraft weapons. This <b>increased</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> aircraft losses forced the Air Force to decree that flak suppression missions would accompany the bombers on missions over the trail. Armed with cluster bomb units (CBUs), the fighter bombers were poised to pounce upon any enemy anti-aircraft positions identified by other aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Since {{producers}} {{search for}} food and scroungers wait for opportunities to join, prey crypsis imposes a producer specific cost that shifts the producer scrounger equilibria towards more scrounging. Prey crypsis resulted in increased latency to eat the seed and <b>increased</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> detection errors. Moreover, {{the presence of a}} competitor negatively affected foraging efficiency under cyptic backgrounds. The foraging efficiency of individuals that had previously foraged with a competitor on cryptic seeds remained low even after the competitor had been removed. Thus, the costs of foraging on cryptic prey may be greater for social foragers than for solitary foragers.|$|E

5|$|According to Amineri, {{one of the}} mod's core developers, initial {{versions}} of Long War used changes to the game's configuration file to change content in the game. After other mod makers that {{were not part of}} the Long War project discovered how to make changes to the game by directly working with its Unreal Engine, more significant game alterations became possible, and the forums of NexusMods became a hub where such changes were exchanged. Many of the mod's key features, including the <b>increased</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> soldiers and the lengthened campaign, first appeared in version beta 1.9, which was released in mid 2013. Shortly after Enemy Within released, Amineri and XMarksTheSpot completed development of a Java-based tool called upkmodder that allowed the team to more effectively manage and implement the changes made by the mod. In the late stages of the mod's development, the team worked directly with the Unreal Development Kit.|$|E
5|$|After Trespass was recorded, {{ill health}} and {{developing}} stage fright caused Phillips to leave Genesis. His last show {{with the band}} took place in Haywards Heath on 18 July 1970. He felt the <b>increased</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> gigs affected the group's creativity and that several songs he wrote were not recorded or performed live. He had contracted bronchial pneumonia and became isolated {{from the rest of}} the band, feeling that it had too many songwriters in it. Banks, Gabriel, and Rutherford saw Phillips as an important member, being the most instrumental in encouraging them to turn professional. They regarded his exit as the band's greatest threat and the most difficult to overcome. Gabriel and Rutherford decided they would continue; Banks agreed on the condition that they find a new drummer that was of equal stature to the rest of the group. Mayhew was therefore fired, though Phillips later thought Mayhew's working-class background clashed with the rest of the band which affected his confidence.|$|E

40|$|Sansiviera is a {{plant that}} hardly needs water, or very little water. This {{occurrence}} is in accordance to its nature as succulent plant capable of preserving water in its leaf tissues. This research aims to know the effect of various farmyard manures and liquid fertilizer concentrations to sansiviera seedling growth. The research was conducted in experimental fields of UMM‚Äôs Faculty of Agriculture in Tegalgondo, with altitude of 560 meters from high sea level, starting from April and ended in July 2007. Factorial randomized block design was employed in this research with two factors, each of which consisted of 3 levels, thus delivering 9 combined treatments, added with 1 control treatment with three replications. The observation started within two weeks after planting with interval of 10 days. The following parameter to be observed were the length of longest leaf, length <b>of</b> average leaf, <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> width leaf, <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sprouting. The treatment of various farmyard manures and liquid fertilizer concentrations {{to the length of}} longest leaf resulted in significant difference. On 5 th observation, no significant difference occurred due to combined treatments for length of average leaf. The combined treatments resulted in no significant difference for <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> width leaf. While the the <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> average leaf gave no significant difference with combined treatments. The parameter of leaf increase showed no significant difference. However, on 6 th observation revealed that treatment of chicken farmyard manure + soil + hull with proportion of 1 : 1 : 1 combined with concentration of 9 ml/l water resulted in highest score to variable <b>of</b> <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> leaf. Parameter <b>of</b> sprouting <b>number</b> resulted in no significant difference among the combined treatments. The conclusion thus can be drawn that the combined treatments gave no interaction to variables of average leaf length, <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> width, and <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> sprout. Whereas for variable <b>of</b> the <b>increasing</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> longest leaf on 5 th observation resulted in significant difference with goat and chicken farmyard manures, respectively.

5|$|Buoyed by a {{recovering}} {{global economy and}} ETOPS approval, 767 sales accelerated in the mid-to-late 1980s; 1989 was the most prolific year with 132 firm orders. By the early 1990s, the wide-body twinjet had become its manufacturer's annual best-selling aircraft, despite a slight decrease due to economic recession. During this period, the 767 became the most common airliner for transatlantic flights between North America and Europe. By {{the end of the}} decade, 767s crossed the Atlantic more frequently than all other aircraft types combined. The 767 also propelled the growth of point-to-point flights which bypassed major airline hubs in favor of direct routes. Taking advantage of the aircraft's lower operating costs and smaller capacity, operators added non-stop flights to secondary population centers, thereby eliminating the need for connecting flights. The <b>increased</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> cities receiving non-stop services caused a paradigm shift in the airline industry as point-to-point travel gained prominence {{at the expense of the}} traditional hub-and-spoke model.|$|E

White cited that his concern for the <b>increased</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> flights and long term use {{of these types of}} medication could lead to dependence and addiction (which is common concern and a point of consensus concern regarding benzodiazepines in the medical community. White likened mental health conditions to a day-to-day physical injury in which symptoms can be dynamic and unclear, but support and policy should be adequately proactive).|$|E
5|$|Gradually {{there were}} <b>increased</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> laws {{regulating}} Zoroastrian behavior, limiting {{their ability to}} participate in society, and made life difficult for the Zoroastrians {{in the hope that}} they would convert to Islam. Over time, persecution of Zoroastrians became more common and widespread, and the number of believers decreased significantly. Many converted, some superficially, to escape the systematic abuse and discrimination by the law of the land. Others accepted Islam because their employment in industrial and artisan work would, according to Zoroastrian dogma, make them impure as their work involved defiling fire. According to Thomas Walker Arnold, Muslim missionaries did not encounter difficulty in explaining Islamic tenants to Zoroastrians, as there were many similarities between the faiths. According to Arnold, for the Persian, he would meet Ahura Mazda and Ahriman under the names of Allah and Iblis.|$|E
