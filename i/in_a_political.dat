5|$|During this period, Albin was {{involved}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> controversy regarding succession to an earldom. An alleged papal bull, dated 13 December 1255, had named Bishop Albin as a papal mandatory, along with Robert de Stuteville, with instructions to investigate Alan Durward's {{claim to the}} earldom of Mar; however, the bull was denounced as a forgery on 28 March 1257, after Durward's rivals had seized power. During the months preceding this denunciation, Albin was once again out of Scotland; on 4 March 1257 his presence was once again recorded at Durham.|$|E

5|$|Having firmly {{assisted}} {{and supported}} {{her husband on}} his path to political greatness, she suddenly died in 1890, aged 39, leaving him, distraught and bereft of her support, to achieve the political destiny which she had plotted. His premiership of the United Kingdom was shambolic, and lasted barely a year. For over thirty years following her death, he wandered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> wilderness, directionless and exceedingly eccentric, until his own death in 1929.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> and {{economic}} referendum held in November 1987, 67% of the eligible voters participated {{and most of}} them approved the government-proposed reforms, but a popular mandate was formally missed because of the unrealistically stringent passage requirements self-imposed by the regime. The referendum debacle dealt a blow to the process of market-oriented economic reforms, which had been pursued by Polish governments since the early 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Macdonald's {{five years}} in Ottawa were tumultuous ones. He oversaw a massive {{increase}} in Canada's naval forces and {{played a key role}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> crisis that threatened to tear the Liberal government and the country apart. He also incurred the wrath of Mackenzie King, a political leader whom Macdonald grew to loathe. When he entered the federal cabinet in 1940, Macdonald seemed a likely candidate to replace the aging King and one day become prime minister himself. By the time he resigned in 1945, Macdonald's federal political career was in tatters.|$|E

5|$|The Test {{selectors}} made five {{changes to}} the team who had played in the previous Test match.

5|$|The disdain of the British {{people for}} the Boers was {{recorded}} {{as early as the}} 18th century.

The English term Boer-hater was used <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> context in the British Cape Colony as early as 1889, referring to persons opposing Cape Dutch interests, the use of their language in Parliament in particular.|$|E

5|$|W. W. Thomas, {{superintendent}} of the Springfield public-school system, believed that home-ownership and citizenship responsibilities {{were a part of}} education and was a key instigator of the project. He involved students in the governmental duties associated with the project, which used the manager-commission form of government to run the lilliputian city. Concepts such as women’s suffrage and political ambition came into play. A 14-year-old orphaned girl was elected Tiny Town's mayor and a 15-year-old boy became its city manager, defeating sixteen other nominees <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> campaign.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} Wiśniowiecki also engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> {{conflict}} over nobility titles, in particular, {{the title of}} prince (kniaź). The nobility in the Commonwealth was officially equal, and used different and non-hereditary titles than those found in {{rest of the world}} (see officials of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth); the gist of the conflict, which took much of the Sejm's time around 1638–41, revolved around whether old prince titles (awarded to families before their lands were incorporated into the Commonwealth in the 1569 Union of Lublin), and the new titles, awarded more recently by some foreign courts, should be recognized. Wiśniowiecki was one of the chief participants in this debate, successfully defending the old titles, including that of his own family, and succeeding in abolishing the new titles, which gained him the enmity of another powerful magnate, Jerzy Ossoliński. Other than this conflict, in his years as a deputy (1635–46), Jeremi wasn't involved in any major political issues, and only twice (in 1640 and 1642) he served in the minor function of a commissar for investigating the eastern and southern border disputes.|$|E

40|$|Decision making during crises {{takes place}} in (multi-agency) teams, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bureaucratic <b>political</b> context. <b>As</b> a result, the common notion that during crises {{decision}} making should be done <b>in</b> line with <b>a</b> Command & Control structure is invalid. This paper shows {{that the best way}} for crisis decision making teams <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bureaucratic <b>political</b> context is to follow an integrative negotiation approach as the shared mental model of decision making. This conclusion is based on an analysis of crisis decision making by teams <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bureaucratic <b>political</b> context. First of all this explains why <b>in</b> <b>a</b> bureaucratic <b>political</b> context the Command & Control adage does not hold. Secondly, this paper motivates why crisis decision making in such context {{can be seen as a}} negotiation process. Further analysis of the given context shows that an assertive and cooperative approach suits crisis decision making best.

5|$|Following {{the death}} of Elizabeth I in 1603, the throne of England was {{inherited}} by the Scottish House of Stuart, resulting in the Union of the Crowns: the Kingdom of England and Kingdom of Scotland were united in a personal union under James VI and I. As a consequence, the Royal Arms of England and Scotland were combined in the king's new personal arms. Nevertheless, although referencing the personal union with Scotland and Ireland, the Royal Arms of England remained distinct from the Royal Arms of Scotland, until the two realms were joined <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> union in 1707, leading to a unified Royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom.|$|E
5|$|In 1795, Scott {{traveled}} to Philadelphia to help clarify service records {{that would determine}} the final pay {{of the men who}} served under him before returning to his farm in Kentucky. He continued to serve, nominally, as major general of the 2nd militia division of the state militia until 1799. Celebrations of Scott's military heroism were held all over Kentucky, sparking his interest <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> career. With the advent of the First Party System, he declared himself a Democratic-Republican, as did most Kentuckians. In 1800, he was chosen as a presidential elector for his district by a vote of 75 to 44 over Caleb Wallace. Scott and his fellow electors all cast their votes for the ticket of Thomas Jefferson and Aaron Burr.|$|E
5|$|In Guam, {{the threat}} of Typhoon Isa {{postponed}} a flight from Guam to Honolulu, Hawaii for 48hours. The flight was the last in , which was a multimillion-dollar humanitarian effort to transport more than 6,600Kurds <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> asylum to the mainland of the United States. The threat of the typhoon also canceled {{the first round of}} the Omega Tour golf event, which was the second professional golf tournament in the island's history. Though Typhoon Isa passed well to the south of Guam, one of its outer rainbands stalled across the island, which dropped heavy rainfall of 15–25cm (6–10in) across the island. The rainfall was welcome as it occurred during the dry season, and largely contributed to rainfall at the Guam International Airport being 45% above normal from the period between January through April. The rainband also produced wind gusts that reached 86km/h (53mph) at the island's Naval Air Station; the winds resulted in sporadic power outages across the island. The typhoon caused some light damage to buildings, particularly on the south side of the island. The combination of winds and sea salt caused damage to the island's tomato, okra, cucumber, and soy bean crops.|$|E

5|$|Making {{contemporary}} political points {{in this way}} through reinterpretation of distant historical episodes was now common. In 17th century France, {{the fall of the}} powerful Cardinal Mazarin was celebrated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> pamphlet that also drew parallels with the career of Sejanus, L'Ambitieux ou le portraict d'Aelius Sejanus en la personne du Cardinal Mazarin (Paris, 1642). In England other royal favourites were seen in these terms too. George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham, is the target of an anonymous manuscript Roman tragedy, The Emperor’s Favourite. The prudent need for anonymity, is suggested by the arrest of Sir John Eliot, who was sent to the Tower of London for his outspoken criticism of the Duke in the 1626 parliament, comparing him to Sejanus.|$|E
5|$|New {{government}} spending, regulation, {{and policies}} helped the industry weather the 2009 economic crisis better {{than many other}} sectors. Most notably, U.S. President Barack Obama's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 included more than $70billion in direct spending and tax credits for clean energy and associated transportation programs. This policy-stimulus combination represents the largest federal commitment in U.S. history for renewables, advanced transportation, and energy conservation initiatives. Based on these new rules, many more utilities strengthened their clean-energy programs. Clean Edge suggests that the commercialization of clean energy will help {{countries around the world}} deal with the current economic malaise. Once-promising solar energy company, Solyndra, became involved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>political</b> controversy involving U.S. President Barack Obama's administration's authorization of a $535million loan guarantee to the Corporation in 2009 as part of a program to promote alternative energy growth. The company ceased all business activity, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, and laid-off nearly all of its employees in early September 2011.|$|E
