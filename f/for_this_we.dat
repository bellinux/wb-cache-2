5|$|A social {{rational}} for the Hindu {{concept of}} rebirth in Hell {{is evident in}} the metric work of the Manusmrti: a written discourse focused on the “law of the social classes”. A large portion of it is designed to help people of the Hindu faith understand evil deeds (pätaka) and their karmic consequences in various hellish rebirths. The Manusmrti, however, does not go into explicit detail of each hell. <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>we</b> turn to the Bhagavata Purana. The Manusmrti lists multiple levels of hell in which a person can be reborn into. The punishments in each of these consecutive hells is directly related the crimes (pätaka) of the current life and how these deeds will effect the next reincarnation during the cycle of Saṃsāra This concept provides structure to society in which crimes have exacting consequences. An opposite social facet to these hellish rebirths is the precise way in which a person can redeem oneself from a particular crime through a series of vows (such as fasting, water purification rituals, chanting, and even sacrifices). These vows must take place during the same life cycle that the crimes were committed in. These religious lessons assist the societal structure by defining approved and unapproved social behavior.|$|E

25|$|A {{feature that}} distinguishes humans from most animals {{is that we}} are not born with an {{extensive}} repertoire of behavioral programs that would enable us to survive on our own ("physiological prematurity"). To compensate <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> <b>we</b> have an unmatched ability to learn, i.e., to consciously acquire such programs by imitation or exploration. Once consciously acquired and sufficiently exercised, these programs can become automated to the extent that their execution happens beyond the realms of our awareness. Take, as an example, the incredible fine motor skills exerted in playing a Beethoven piano sonata or the sensorimotor coordination required to ride a motorcycle along a curvy mountain road. Such complex behaviors are possible only because a sufficient number of the subprograms involved can be executed with minimal or even suspended conscious control. In fact, the conscious system may actually interfere somewhat with these automated programs.|$|E

[...] The Amish do not normally accept charity, but because of the extreme nature of the tragedy, donations were accepted. Richie Lauer, director of the Anabaptist Foundation, said the Amish community, whose religious beliefs prohibit them from having health insurance, will likely use the donations to help pay the medical costs of the hospitalized children.|$|E

2500|$|To account <b>for</b> <b>this,</b> <b>W.E.</b> Castle {{postulated}} {{that there was}} a third allele at the Extension locus: ED or [...] "dominant black". Based on the existence of such conditions in other animals, Castle suggested that the dominant black gene (ED) would override the [...] "points" [...] pattern of dominant Agouti (A) and produce black or near-black horses, which could then go on to have bay offspring. The implication was that the seal brown coat color, which is often quite nearly black, could be produced by this allele., extends the dark pigment so much that it actually masks the effect of the bay pattern gene, A. He called this the gene for dominant black and described the color as jet black, which does not fade in sunlight as the ordinary black may do. The foal coat is also thought to be black, whereas the first coat of the recessive black is often more of a mouse gray color. The existence of a similar gene in other mammals helped lead him to this conclusion. Thus, ED is thought to extend the dark color even if A or at is present (that is, ED is epistatic to A and at). A jet black could be ED_aa or ED_A_ or ED_atat or ED_ata, where the blank indicates that the paired gene has no effect. There is no direct evidence that the gene ED exists in the horse." ...|$|E
