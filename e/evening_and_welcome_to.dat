5000|$|Pickard and Thomas Halliday became {{critical}} of Macdonald's cautious approach to trade unionism, and founded a new Amalgamated Association of Miners (AAM), with Pickard as treasurer. This new association advocated more militant action, including solidarity strikes, {{but continued to}} co-operate with the MNA, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>welcomed</b> Macdonald <b>to</b> speak at its conferences. [...] The AAM was initially successful, expanding across Great Britain and winning several strikes, which inspired Pickard to stand as a Liberal-Labour candidate in Wigan at the 1874 UK general election, taking fourth place of five candidates.|$|R

This new association advocated more militant action, including solidarity strikes, {{but continued to}} co-operate with the MNA, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>welcomed</b> Macdonald <b>to</b> speak at its conferences. The AAM was initially successful, expanding across Great Britain and winning several strikes, proving particularly prominent in South Wales. This inspired Halliday to stand as a Liberal-Labour candidate in Merthyr Tydfil at the 1874 UK general election, taking 25% of the vote, but only third place.|$|R
60|$|Now it all grew {{clear to}} Morris. In Stella he beheld {{an example of}} the doctrines of Christianity really inspiring the daily life of the believer. If her strong faith {{animated}} all those who served under that banner, then in like circumstances they would act as she had acted. They would have no doubts; their fears would vanish; their griefs be comforted, and, to a great extent, <b>even</b> the promptings <b>and</b> passions of their mortality would be trodden under foot. With Stella they would be ready to neglect the temporary in their certainty of the eternal, <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>to</b> <b>welcome</b> death, <b>to</b> them in truth, and not in mere convention, the Gate of Life.|$|R

50|$|Gyngell's media {{career began}} in the record industry, in the mid-1950s, when {{he was hired by}} Australian label Festival Records. He was soon poached by Sir Frank Packer, who hired him to assist in the {{establishment}} of TCN-9, Australia's first commercial television station, in 1956. Gyngell is often credited as being the first person to appear on Australian television on 16 September 1956, when he spoke the words, 'Good <b>evening,</b> <b>and</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> television'. However, many people (possibly several hundred) had already appeared in various television test broadcasts in Australia prior to Gyngell, including performer Alan Rowe, comedy duo 'Ada & Elsie', 'Happy' Hammond, and Graham Kennedy.|$|E
50|$|Sunrunners are the {{impartial}} mediators of the Continent and {{the quickest}} form of communication. They {{communicate with each}} other all over the world, keeping families in contact, Princes and Lords aware of political happenings, and performing ceremonies - such as Namings, Choosings, or Burnings - as needed. Sunrunners are forbidden to participate in battle lest it is to save their own lives, to take sides in a debate, and most importantly they are forbidden to use their gifts to kill. Faradhi oaths also include a vow of silence to ensure the trust of Sunrunner messengers. These limitations enable the rest of the Continent <b>to</b> accept <b>and</b> <b>even</b> <b>welcome</b> Sunrunners <b>to</b> their courts and into their lives.|$|R

Each is a collector’s item in its own way—not because of any special artistic quality, but because each captures on a canvas, suspends in time and space, a frozen moment of a nightmare. Our initial offering: a small gothic item in blacks and grays, a piece of the past known as the family crypt. This one we call, simply, “The Cemetery.” Offered to you now, six feet of earth and all that it contains. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the Night Gallery...|$|E
5000|$|Serling {{appeared}} {{in an art}} gallery setting and introduced the macabre tales that made up each episode by unveiling paintings (by artists Thomas J. Wright and Jaroslav [...] "Jerry" [...] Gebr) that depicted the stories. His intro usually was, “Good <b>evening,</b> <b>and</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> a private showing of three paintings, displayed {{here for the first}} time. Each is a collector’s item in its own way—not because of any special artistic quality, but because each captures on a canvas, suspended in time and space, a frozen moment of a nightmare.”Night Gallery regularly presented adaptations of classic fantasy tales by authors such as H. P. Lovecraft, as well as original works, many of which were by Serling himself.|$|E

He was ridiculed by Paul Merton and Ian Hislop in the following episode of Have I Got News For You but continued as presenter. Deayton began the episode with: [...] "Good <b>evening</b> <b>and</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> Have I Got News For You, where this week's loser is presenting it." [...] He added later, [...] "For those watching at home, don't adjust your sets, my face really is this red." [...] After more allegations in October, Deayton was sacked two episodes into the new series after Merton and Hislop repeatedly implied during the programme that Deayton should resign.|$|E

Many central banking innovations, such as interest on reserves and large-scale asset purchases, aren’t adequately treated in standard textbooks. The following is adapted from a presentation made by the president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco to the AEA National Conference on Teaching Economics and Research in Economic Education in San Francisco on June 1, 2011. Good <b>evening</b> <b>and</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. It’s a special pleasure to have you with us. As Chairman Bernanke (2006) has noted, economics education is “a critical component of the Federal Reserve’s mission. ” You are the ones who teach this often confounding subject—not only to those who will follow careers in finance and economics, but also to future engineers, artists, and elementary school teachers. For our part, we at the Fed have an enormous stake in economics education. The Fed has often appeared to be clouded in mystery. People often misunderstand our mission and what we do. That’s been especially true these past few years. In response to the financial crisis and recession, we deployed an array of new monetary policy and lending tools that were not part of our standard playbook and no...|$|E
40|$|Good <b>evening</b> <b>and</b> <b>welcome</b> <b>to</b> the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco. It’s {{a special}} {{pleasure}} to have you with us. As Chairman Bernanke has noted, economics education is “a critical component of the Federal Reserve’s mission. ” 2 You are the ones who teach this often confounding subject—not only to those who will follow careers in finance and economics, but also to future engineers, artists, and elementary school teachers. For our part, we at the Fed have an enormous stake in economics education. The Fed has often appeared to be clouded in mystery. People often misunderstand our mission and what we do. That’s been especially true these past few years. In response to the financial crisis and recession, we deployed an array of new monetary policy and lending tools that were not part of our standard playbook and not found in any textbook. That’s {{one of the reasons why}} we recognize the importance of good communication and transparency, through initiatives such as the Chairman’s periodic press conferences. It is essential that the public have a solid base of knowledge about economics and monetary policy that will allow people to make informed judgments about the Federal Reserve. We depend on educators like you to explain how the Fed works and how our policies affect the economy. We all benefit when the public understands what we do and why, so we are very grateful for the work you do. 1 I want to thank John Fernald, Eric Swanson, and Sam Zuckerman for their assistance in preparing these remarks...|$|E
