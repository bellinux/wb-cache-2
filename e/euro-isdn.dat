50|$|Digital Subscriber Signalling System No. 1 (DSS1) is {{a digital}} {{signalling}} protocol (D channel protocol) {{used for the}} ISDN. It is defined by ITU-T I.411 (ETS 300 102). It supports Bearer Capability, Low Level Compatibility and High Level Compatibility, ANI, DNIS and redirected number signaling in both directions. A standard developed by ETSI for Europe is known as <b>Euro-ISDN</b> or E-DSS1 or simply EDSS1 (European DSS1).|$|E
40|$|Despite {{the great}} success WWW {{applications}} experience within the Internet commu-nity, {{the usefulness of}} the WWW in its present form seems to be limited to the presentation of static data. This restriction is not acceptable, especially for pretentiouscommercial applications. The transmission characteristics of the Internet are not appropriate for high-band-width, low-latency audio- and video-based applications, with many users working on the same data. Other information networks based on high communication rates, as appropriate forreal-time requirements, like ATM or B-ISDN, are currently evolving. But still, only few applications exist that make use of these capabilities. Products as successful as theWWW do not-yet- exist in this field. The aims of the workshop are: * to identify the requirements for commercially-oriented, bandwidth-intensive appli-cations like video-on-demand, pay-per-view, on-line browsing of extensive data stores, etc. * to determine to which extend the mechanisms of the WWW are able to fulfill theserequirements. * to identify the relations between WWW-based systems and architectures from otherdistributed multi-media (but not WWW-based) platforms, like MHEG-based systems. * to present approaches for solutions that are tailored to highspeed networks. * to discuss topics like interoperability of highspeed multimedia applications withnarrowed bandwidth networks such as <b>Euro-ISDN...</b>|$|E
