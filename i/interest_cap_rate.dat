40|$|Australia {{is going}} through a major reform of {{consumer}} credit regulation, with the implementation of a proposal to transfer regulatory responsibility from the State and Territory Governments to the Commonwealth Government. While the broad policy approach is supported, the reform process has missed a significant opportunity to engage directly with issues of financial exclusion and with the potential role of regulation to reduce financial exclusion. The imposition of an <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>cap</b> can limit the impact of financial exclusion. However, the future of the existing <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps</b> is uncertain, given the diversity of approaches, and the heated debate that surrounds this issue. In the absence of support for regulatory initiatives to increase the availability of low cost, small loans, permitting regulatory diversity on this issue of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps,</b> within an otherwise centralised regulatory framework., can minimise the impact of financial exclusion on consumers...|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, these created {{problems}} for some banks {{as the high}} inflation of that period resulted in them borrowing money at higher rates than they could lend it.

40|$|Asset prices {{depend on}} two elements: the {{dynamics}} of the state variables and the pricing kernel. Traditional term structure models differ in the factor dynamics. However, most of them imply a log-linear pricing kernel. We investigate empirically the role of factor dynamics and pricing kernel in pricing interest rate derivatives using a nonparametric approach. We find that the prices of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps</b> are very sensitive to the specification of the factor dynamics, especially when they are close to expiration. In addition, nonlinear log-pricing kernels improve the pricing of long-maturity caps. Recent research document models that fit libor and swap rates but do not price derivatives well, leading to the so called “unspanned stochastic volatility puzzle”. Additional factors seem to be needed to explain cap prices. However, the relative mispricing between <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps</b> and underlying libor and swap rates could also potentially be due to mis-specification of the parametric models used. Our paper provides evidence, from a nonparametric perspective, for the inability of diffusion-only type of models to price <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps.</b> Models with jumps such as that in Jarrow, Li, and Zhao (JF, forthcoming) is needed to explain the prices of libor options...|$|R

40|$|This paper compares two {{different}} strategies for managing interest rate exposure. One involves maintaining a borrowing portfolio using {{short and long}} term debt lines in order to maintain an average borrowing cost. The second involves using <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps</b> to manage exposure to interest rate risk. The two strategies are compared using a set of daily quarterly rates from three months out to 10 years (120 months) of BBSW zero rates, par rates and forward rates from June 2000 to September 2006. The data set of implied volatilities (Appendix I used for <b>interest</b> <b>cap</b> quoting and pricing) consists of volatilities for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7 and 10 year maturities; the data set is made up of daily closing mid-quotes for the period. We examine whether <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps</b> would be a better alternative for minimising interest rate risk as compared to a structure that combines a portfolio of rolling short-term debt with one of rolling long-term debt lines. Using principal component analysis (PCA) we explore the behaviour of, and the number of factors driving volatilities. As caps are quoted in terms of implied volatilities, and we know BlackÃŒs (1976) model is very sensitive to changes in these volatilities. We use PCA to examine the factors driving cap price volatilities. We explore the best way of using <b>caps</b> to manage <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk. This should help us understand what factors affect cap prices and how many factors might be used in the interest rate models used to price interest rate derivatives such as caps and floors. We use Sharpe ratios to assess the relative borrowing costs of different strategies in relation to the volatility of their outcomes. We examine whether <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps</b> would be a more efficient method for minimising interest rate risk as compared to the a portfolio of loans.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} a modified constant elasticity of variance (MCEV) model. This model uses the familiar constant elasticity of variance {{form for the}} volatility of the growth optimal portfolio (GOP) in a continuous market. It leads to a GOP that follows {{the power of a}} time-transformed squared Bessel process. This paper derives analytic real-world prices for zero-coupon bonds, instantaneous forward rates and options on the GOP that are both theoretically revealing and computationally efficient. In addition, the paper examines options on exchange prices and options on zero-coupon bonds under the MCEV model. The semi-analytic prices derived for options on zero-coupon bonds can subsequently be used to price <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps</b> and floors.

40|$|Using {{more than}} two years of daily <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>cap</b> price data, this paper {{provides}} a systematic documentation of a volatility smile in cap prices. We find that Black (1976) implied volatilities exhibit an asymmetric smile (sometimes called a sneer) with a stronger skew for in-the-money caps than out-of-the-money caps. The volatility smile is time varying and is more pronounced after September 11, 2001. We also study the ability of generalized LIBOR market models to capture this smile. We show that the best performing model has constant elasticity of variance combined with uncorrelated stochastic volatility or upward jumps. However, this model still has a bias for short- and medium-term caps. In addition, it appears that large negative jumps are needed after September 11, 2001. We conclude that the existing class of LIBOR market models can not fully capture the volatility smileLIBOR market models, volatility smile, <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article derives {{a series}} of {{analytic}} formulae for various contingent claims under the real-world probability measure using the stylised minimal market model (SMMM). This model provides realistic dynamics for the growth optimal portfolio (GOP) as a well-diversified equity index. It captures both leptokurtic returns with correct tail properties and the leverage effect. Under the SMMM, the discounted GOP {{takes the form of}} a time-transformed squared Bessel process of dimension four. From this property, one finds that the SMMM possesses a special and interesting relationship to non-central chi-square random variables with zero degrees of freedom. The analytic formulae derived under the SMMM include options on the GOP, options on exchange prices and options on zero-coupon bonds. For options on zero-coupon bonds, analytic prices facilitate efficient calculation of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>caps</b> and floors.
