5000|$|Initially, {{the project}} {{suffered}} {{from a lack of}} community interest. Following Hurricane Katrina in 2005, however, natural gas prices spiked and caused a massive increase in island electricity bills. Community meetings were convened in the spring of 2008 to discuss the proposed wind project. A preliminary economic analysis was conducted for the cooperative in 2008 {{with the help of the}} non-profit Island Institute. The institute also provided half of the funding necessary to conduct an environmental study on avian impacts, a visual <b>impact</b> <b>simulation,</b> and a logistical feasibility analysis. A detailed economic analysis of the project suggested that electricity rates could be lowered by 2 to 4 cents per kilowatt hour for the first 10 years and twice that amount in the following 10 years. Fox Islands Electric Cooperative members demonstrated overwhelming support for the project, voting 383 to 5 in favor on July 28, 2008. Funding for the three 1.5 MW turbines was projected to cost the cooperative $12-14 million. [...] The cooperative secured a $9.5 million loan from the Rural Utilities Service of the USDA. Fox Islands Electric Cooperative also created Fox Islands Wind LLC, a separate for-profit corporation that could take advantage of tax credits. Dr. George Baker was selected as CEO of the company, which secured a commitment from Diversified Communications of Portland, Maine to purchase the tax credits for $5 million.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{compares the}} use of two <b>impact</b> <b>simulation</b> methods for two-degree-of-freedom {{nonlinear}} vibroimpact systems with rigid and soft impacts. These methods are (I) <b>impact</b> <b>simulation</b> by boundary conditions with {{the use of}} Newton's restitution coefficient based on stereomechanic shock theory and (II) <b>impact</b> <b>simulation</b> by contact interaction force based on quasistatic Hertz's contact theory. It is shown that both methods are applied and give the coinciding results for system with elastic rigid impact under periodic external loading. Loading curves built by parameter continuation method are confirming this result. <b>Impact</b> <b>simulation</b> by the second method is also fulfilled for vibroimpact system with rigid impact under random external loading. For vibroimpact system with soft impact, the simulation of impact by the second method gives a better result. The application of linear elastic force as contact one is possible too but the use of Hertz's contact force is more preferable. The authors consider that the <b>impact</b> <b>simulation</b> by Hertz contact interaction force gives good results for nonlinear vibroimpact systems with impacts of any kind if all limitations with Hertz's law used are observed...|$|E

Understanding vehicle {{occupant}} responses during real-world rear collision accidents {{is very important}} in the development of appropriate safety technologies for neck injury lessening. In this study, numerical analysis of {{vehicle occupant}} responses during rear impact were conducted by using a human multi-body model, a seat finite element model and crash accelerations obtained from real-world accidents. The human multi-body model was developed based on the body characteristics of a typical Japanese male, including the outer body geometry, inertial properties of body segments and passive joint characteristics. The seat finite element model was extracted from a detailed car finite element model. A small modification was done to the seat model to deal with the rear <b>impact</b> <b>simulations.</b> The crash accelerations were obtained from the drive recorder database of rear collision accidents occurred in Japan. Several crash accelerations were selected and used as input conditions during the rear <b>impact</b> <b>simulations.</b> Kinematic responses of the occupants during the accidents can be reasonably predicted by the simulations. Furthermore, different level of accelerations leads to different kinematics responses that may cause variation in injury occurrence and injury severity...|$|R

A previous report D 3. 1. 8 discussed a deterministic model for stone and ice impact, {{which is used}} here {{as the basis for}} stochastic <b>impact</b> <b>simulations.</b> This showed that impact damage is very localised, requiring a fine FE model of the impact region, so that attention is restricted to a vulnerable element in the HTP which is the sandwich stiffened LE shell between 2 ribs. The stochastic tool in PAM-OPT is used to investigate the influence of composites properties and impact conditions on simulated impact damage in a CFRP/honeycomb sandwich with carbon fabric/epoxy skins. In this report a stochastic methodology is defined with PAM-OPT and demonstrated by investigating damage from a rigid impactor. It is shown how a stochastic analysis may be used to define limiting conditions for panel damage when impactors will just penetrate the sandwich skin.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of <b>impact</b> <b>simulations</b> for aircraft components made with triaxial braided carbon fiber composites is currently limited by inadequate material property data {{and lack of}} validated material models for analysis. Improvements to standard quasi-static test methods are needed {{to account for the}} large unit cell size and localized damage within the unit cell. The deformation and damage of a triaxial braided composite material was examined using standard quasi-static in-plane tension, compression, and shear tests. Some modifications to standard test specimen geometries are suggested, and methods for measuring the local strain at the onset of failure within the braid unit cell are presented. Deformation and damage at higher strain rates is examined using ballistic impact tests on 61 - by 61 - by 3. 2 -mm (24 - by 24 - by 0. 125 -in.) composite panels.

40|$|Large impact {{structures}} have complex morphologies, with {{zones of}} structural uplift {{that can be}} expressed topographically as central peaks and/or peak rings internal to the crater rim. The formation of these structures requires transient strength reduction in the target material {{and one of the}} proposed mechanisms to explain this behavior is acoustic fluidization. Here, samples of shock-metamorphosed quartz-bearing lithologies at the West Clearwater Lake impact structure, Canada, are used to estimate the maximum recorded shock pressures in three dimensions across the crater. These measurements demonstrate that the currently-observed distribution of shock metamorphism is strongly controlled by the formation of the structural uplift. The distribution of peak shock pressures, together with apparent crater morphology and geological observations, is compared with numerical <b>impact</b> <b>simulations</b> to constrain parameters used in the block-model implementation of acoustic fluidization. The numerical simulations produce craters that are consistent with morphological and geological observations.
