The exception to this is the two species of <b>giant</b> <b>petrel,</b> which like the albatrosses, have strong legs used to feed on land (see below).

25|$|The {{island has}} been {{designated}} as an Important Bird Area by BirdLife International because of its importance as {{a breeding ground for}} seabirds. In 1978–79 there were an estimated 117,000 breeding penguins on the island, consisting of macaroni penguin and, to a lesser extent, chinstrap penguin and Adélie penguin, although these were only estimated to be 62,000 in 1989–90. Nyrøysa is the most important colony for penguins, supplemented by Posadowskybreen, Kapp Circoncision, Norvegiaodden and across from Larsøya. Southern fulmar {{is by far the most}} common non-penguin bird with 100,000 individuals. Other breeding seabirds consist of Cape petrel, Antarctic prion, Wilson's storm petrel, black-bellied storm petrel, subantarctic skua, southern <b>giant</b> <b>petrel,</b> snow petrel, slender-billed prion and Antarctic tern. Kelp gull is thought to have bred on the island earlier. Non-breeding birds which can be found on the island include the king penguin, wandering albatross, black-browed albatross, Campbell albatross, Atlantic yellow-nosed albatross, sooty albatross, light-mantled albatross, northern <b>giant</b> <b>petrel,</b> Antarctic petrel, blue petrel, soft-plumaged petrel, Kerguelen petrel, white-headed petrel, fairy prion, white-chinned petrel, great shearwater, common diving petrel, south polar skua and parasitic jaeger.|$|E

50|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>petrels</b> form a genus, Macronectes, {{from the}} family Procellariidae, which {{consists}} of two species. They are the largest birds of this family. Both species are restricted to the Southern Hemisphere, and though their distributions overlap significantly, with both species breeding on the Prince Edward Islands, Crozet Islands, Kerguelen Islands, Macquarie Island and South Georgia, many southern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> nest further south, with colonies {{as far south as}} Antarctica. <b>Giant</b> <b>petrels</b> are aggressive predators and scavengers, inspiring another common name, the stinker. South Sea whalers used to call them gluttons.|$|R
40|$|We {{analysed}} {{concentrations of}} cadmium, lead, mercury and selenium in blood from {{males and females}} of the 2 sibling species of <b>giant</b> <b>petrels,</b> the northern Macronectes halli and the southern M. giganteus, breeding sympatrically at Bird Island (South Georgia, Antarctica). Blood samples were collected in 1998 during the incubation period, from 5 November to 10 December. Between species, cadmium and lead concentrations were significantly higher for northern than for southern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels,</b> which probably resulted from northern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> wintering in more polluted areas (mainly on the Patagonian Shelf and Falkland Islands) compared to southern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> (wintering mainly around South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands). Between sexes, cadmium concentrations were significantly higher for females than for males in both species, corresponding to the more pelagic habits of females compared to the more scavenging habits of males. Lead and cadmium concentrations in circulating blood decreased significantly over the incubation period, suggesting that when breeding at Bird Island, exposure {{to the source of}} pollution had ended, and these metals had been cleared from the blood and excreted, or rapidly transferred to other tissues. Association of lead and cadmium with a common source of pollution was further corroborated by a significant positive correlation between the levels of the 2 elements found. Mercury levels were similar between the species, but showed an opposite trend between sexes, with males showing higher levels than females in northern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels,</b> and the opposite was true in southern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels,</b> with no changes throughout incubation. Selenium levels were similar between sexes, but significantly greater for northern than for southern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels.</b> Moreover, there was {{a significant increase in the}} selenium levels over the incubation period in northern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels.</b> Age of adult birds did not affect metal concentrations. Coefficients of variation of metal levels were consistently lower for northern than for southern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels,</b> particularly for mercury, suggesting that the former species is more dietary specialised than the latter. Contaminant analyses, when combined with accurate information on seabird movements, obtained through geolocation or satellite tracking, help us to understand geographic variation of pollution in the marine environment...|$|R

40|$|We satellite-tracked the {{foraging}} trips {{of males}} and females of the 2 sibling species of <b>giant</b> <b>petrels,</b> Macronectes halli and M. giganteus, breeding sympatrically at Bird Island (South Georgia, Antarctica), during the incubation period (November-December). Size of the activity range in addition to speed and distance covered on foraging trips were similar between the species, but were lower for males than for females in both species. Sex-specific differences agree with previous observations on diets and on attendance at seal carcasses, suggesting that females mainly forage at sea, whereas males mainly scavenge on the coast. Overall, however, the foraging ecology of both species seems very similar. Interspecific and intersexual competition may be reduced by the limited overlap in the at-sea range, with southern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> foraging further south than did northern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels,</b> and females further west than males, suggesting some spatial partitioning in foraging areas. Male northern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> foraged almost exclusively on the South Georgia coast; their strong dependence during the brooding and chick-rearing period on Antarctic fur seals, whose population has increased exponentially in recent years, may be reflected in the recent population increase of northern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> at South Georgia. Foraging areas of <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> overlapped extensively with longline fishery distribution, highlighting their susceptibility to being caught on longline hooks. Females were at higher risk during the study period since they made longer trips and foraged further west than males, into areas where local longline fisheries are more active...|$|R

40|$|In avian {{species that}} have evolved life-history {{strategies}} wherein molt and breeding overlap, there are potential {{conflicts between the}} regulatory roles of baseline prolactin and corticosterone in parental care (positive) and moult (negative). We describe seasonal patterns of hormonal secretion, moult, and parental behaviour in sibling species of <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> (Macronectes spp.) which begin moult during the incubation/ early chick-rearing stage of reproduction. With the exception of male Southern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> (Macronectes giganteus), prolactin secretion and moult in Northern (Macronectes halli) and female Southern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> conformed to those observed in all other avian species, with the initiation of moult coincident with decreases from peak prolactin levels. However, male Southern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> began moulting early in incubation when prolactin was increasing and had not yet peaked, which suggests a requirement of prolactin for incubation behaviour and a dissociation of prolactin from moult. Corticosterone showed little seasonal variation and no relationship with moult. When comparing prolactin, corticosterone, and moult in failed vs. active breeders, we found that failed breeding enabled a more rapid down-regulation of prolactin, thus facilitating a more rapid moult. We present specific examples of the behavioural ecology of <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> which we conclude help mediate any potential hormonal conflicts between parental care and moult...|$|R

40|$|Studies on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) in Antarctic {{wildlife}} are scarce, {{and usually}} {{limited to a}} single locality. As a result, wildlife exposure to POPs across the Southern Ocean is poorly understood. In this study, we report the differential exposure of the major southern ocean scavengers, the <b>giant</b> <b>petrels,</b> to POPs across a wide latitudinal gradient. Selected POPs (PCBs, HCB, DDTs, PBDEs) and related compounds, such as Dechlorane Plus (DP), were analyzed in plasma of southern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> (Macronectes giganteus) breeding on Livingston (62 °S 61 °W, Antarctica), Marion (46 °S 37 °E, sub-Antarctic), and Gough (40 °S 10 °W, cool temperate) islands. Northern <b>giant</b> <b>petrels</b> (Macronectes halli) from Marion Island were also studied. Stable isotope ratios of C and N (δC and δN) were used as dietary tracers of the marine habitat and trophic level, respectively. Breeding locality was a major factor explaining petrel exposure to POPs compared with species and sex. Significant relationships between δC values and POP burdens, at both inter- and intra-population levels, support latitudinal variations in feeding grounds as {{a key factor in}} explaining petrel pollutant burdens.
