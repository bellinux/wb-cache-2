This paper investigates the effects of model parameters uncertainty on the seismic response of a steel-concrete composite bridge with dissipative piers and with <b>deck</b> <b>transverse</b> motion restrained at the abutments. Monte Carlo simulation with Latin Hypercube sampling and incremental dynamic analysis are employed to propagate the effects of this uncertainty through the response assessment of the finite element model of the bridge.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{optimization}} of ro-ro/pax deck structures, focusing on the primary supporting beams in absence of pillars, as these decks have to be free, as far as possible, {{in order to facilitate}} the ship loading and unloading. Some typical ro-ro/pax grillage type decks have been analyzed, aiming at a numerical comparison between the primary supporting beam stress values obtained by the following techniques: Shade orthotropic plate bending theory, grillage analysis, finite-element method. As a result, it has been assessed the relative accuracy of such analysis techniques in <b>deck</b> <b>transverse</b> and girder dimensioning. Considering the necessity to minimize the deck structural weight and the web height, especially to improve the ship stability, it has been investigated the influence of each grillage parameter on deck framing behaviour, particularly in relation to the structural weight. These results have been achieved by a dedicated program, developed in MATLAB, that, thanks to nested iterative cycles, optimizes grillage parameters, the minimum structural weight being the objective. Finally, some general guidelines to obtain easily a grillage dimensioning quite close to the optimized one are suggested...|$|E

30|$|In the {{transverse}} direction, insignificant {{variation of}} transverse displacements with the skew angle {{was observed at}} nodes 90 and 74 as shown earlier, while displacement at the node 64 (at abutment; Figure 14) increased significantly with the skew angles due {{to the effect of}} shear keys. <b>Transverse</b> <b>deck</b> displacements at the abutments for ‘without shear key’ cases were about four times than those ‘with shear keys’. Also, the average <b>transverse</b> <b>deck</b> displacements for bridges without shear keys were larger than those with shear keys for a given skew angle. At 60 ° skew, transverse displacements for without shear key cases were larger than without skew cases by about 60 %. This clearly shows the effect of shear keys on the response and, furthermore, it shows that the demand on shear keys increase as the skew increases. It can be concluded that shear keys assist in reducing the <b>transverse</b> <b>deck</b> displacements, especially at the abutments, by a factor of more than 4.

In many previous analyses of the collision problem, the bow of the impacting ship was considered rigid.

A structural model is developed by identifying localized zones of plastic deformations from photographs of damaged ships. Then, the contributions of the membrane and bending resistance is assessed and a simple computational model is developed. The solution includes determination of the force-indentation relationship, a number of folds and a total amount of damage for a given speed of a ship.

40|$|Precast {{concrete}} bridge deck panels {{have been used}} for decades to accelerate bridge construction. Cracking of the transverse connection between panels is a common problem that can damage deck overlays and cause connection leaking leading to corrosion of lower bridge elements. To better understand the behavior of bridge <b>deck</b> <b>transverse</b> female-to-female connections, shear and moment lab testing were performed at Utah State University for the Utah Department of Transportation. Two existing UDOT connections were tested, a welded stud connection and a post tensioned connection. A variation of the welded connection using rebar was also tested. In addition, two new curved bolt connections were tested as a new method of post tensioning a connection. The manner of connection cracking and associated cracking loads were recorded along with the ultimate connection capacities. The connections were also tested in a low cycle, high amplitude cyclical shear test. Lab testing showed that the welded stud connection had the lowest moment capacity. It also showed that the welded rebar connection had significantly higher strength than the welded stud connection with higher cracking and ultimate loads.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} effects of soil-structure {{interaction}} and spatial variability of seismic motion due to nonlinear site amplification on the seismic behaviour of long multi-span bridges founded on piles. An analysis framework able to include the spatial variation of ground motion induced by specific geological and geomorphological scenarios in the seismic soil-structure interaction analysis of long bridges is adopted, exploiting advantages of the substructure approach. The methodology is applied to a case study constituted by a pile-supported multi-span bridge founded in a soft clay deposit overlaying a stiff bedrock with three different configurations: horizontal, inclined and wedge-shaped. The reference input motion at the outcropping bedrock is represented {{by a set of}} real accelerograms and different seismic response models are used to compute site amplification effects, discussing the contribution to the free-field ground motion of both the two-dimensional configuration of the deposit and the nonlinear soil behaviour. The ground motions obtained from the different models are then used for computing the foundation input motion accounting for the pileâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 soil kinematic interaction; thereafter, inertial interaction analyses are performed on structural models with either fixed or compliant base, considering the non-synchronous seismic actions at the piers foundation.

30|$|Transverse {{cracking}} {{has been}} observed in many bridge decks in Florida and other states (e.g., Wan et al. 2010). <b>Transverse</b> <b>deck</b> cracking {{is more likely to}} occur in early ages. The ACI Committee 231, Properties of Concrete at Early Ages, identified “early age” as the period after final setting (ACI 231 2010). During this period, concrete properties change rapidly. Early-age volume changes are induced by temperature change, hydration, and drying shrinkage. This volume change can lead to early-age cracking due to restraint of volume changes associated with thermal deformation, shrinkage due to hydration reactions, and shrinkage due to drying. Such cracking can adversely affect strength, serviceability, and durability of bridge decks. Also, the development of deck cracking increases the effect of freeze and thaw cycles which may lead to spalling of concrete, and thus, resulting in corrosion of steel reinforcement. <b>Transverse</b> <b>deck</b> cracking may also increase carbonation and chloride penetration leading to accelerated steel reinforcement corrosion. Also, a possible damage to underlying components may take place, and the bridge may experience premature deterioration. Therefore, <b>transverse</b> <b>deck</b> cracks affect bridges causing loss of stiffness, and eventually, loss of function, undesirable esthetic condition, reduction of service life of structures, and increase in maintenance costs.|$|R

40|$|The dynamic {{behaviour}} of short simply-supported railway bridges under convoy circulations and, especially, {{the effect of}} soil structure interaction (SSI) in the maximum expectable <b>deck</b> <b>transverse</b> response is {{the aim of this}} study. These structures due to their usually light weight may experience excessively high acceleration levels under resonant conditions. In order to approach this wave propagation problem, a coupled three-dimensional Boundary Element-Finite Element model formulated in the time domain is used to reproduce the soil and structural behaviour, respectively. As the resonant phenomenon in this application is highly influenced by the free vibration response of the deck, a sensitivity analysis is designed in order to first analyse how SSI affects the free vibration response of beams under the circulation of a single moving load {{in a wide range of}} velocities. A subset of beam bridges is defined considering span lengths ranging from 12. 5 to 25 m, and fundamental frequencies covering associated typologies. A single soil layer is considered with shear wave velocities ranging from 150 to 365 m/s. From the single load free vibration parametric analysis conclusions are derived regarding the conditions of maximum free vibration and cancellation of the response. These conclusions are used afterwards to justify how resonant amplitudes of the bridge under the circulation of railway convoys are affected by the soil properties, leading to substantially amplified responses or to almost cancelled ones, and numerical examples are included to show the aforementioned situationsThe third and fourth authors would like to acknowledge the financial support provided by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (Ministerio de Econom´ıa y Competitividad) under the research project [BIA 2013 - 43085 -P]...|$|E
40|$|Thermally induced {{stresses}} in composite steel-concrete bridges {{are higher}} than those experienced by their concrete and steel cousins due to dissimilarity in material properties. These thermal stresses are relatively high when compared to service load stresses, leading to significant damage that manifest itself in terms of crack development in the concrete deck. This in turns leads to the corrosion of the steel reinforcement, steel superstructure, along with {{the deterioration of the}} concrete through water seepage. The various bridge design codes emphasize the importance of thermal stresses by providing designers with suggested thermal gradients that account for the temperature differential in bridges. However, previous studies have failed to account for the pre-existing construction transverse cracks in the concrete deck and their effect on the temperature distribution in composite bridges. In this study, a three-dimensional finite element model was developed to investigate the temperature distribution in a selected case study bridge. The model is a realistic depiction of an existing bridge with pre-existing transverse deck cracks and actual environmental boundary conditions for a selected geographical region. The results of a thermo-elastic analysis show that the AASHTO LRFD Bridge Design Specification is overly conservative and overestimates the vertical temperature gradient for the studied bridge. The AASHTO and other models found in existing literature seem to ignore the nonlinear thermal gradient for composite bridges, which produces a nonlinear strain component that can be critical for the bridge design and cannot be treated in a trivial manner. In addition, the pre-service <b>deck</b> <b>transverse</b> cracks appear to have a considerable effect on both, the vertical and the longitudinal temperature distributions in composite steel-concrete bridges, and hence require further assessment.

40|$|FRP bridge decks offer several {{advantages}} compared with conventional concrete bridge decks, particularly their much lower weight, {{but also their}} resistance against corrosion as well as easier installation and maintenance. The poorly conceived methods available for connecting FRP bridge decks with their supporting structures – normally steel girders – nonetheless constitute a disadvantage. Connections involving studs or bolts are not appropriate in this case, since FRP is a very brittle material that offers no ductile properties. Bolted connections usually result in much higher stress concentrations, while adhesive bonding is a more material-adapted connection method since larger surfaces can be linked together, thus ensuring reduced stresses. The bridge system investigated in this thesis consists of a pultruded FRP bridge deck bonded to steel main girders, the bridge's main structural components, which have to transmit the dead and traffic loads to the supports, whereas the bridge deck is spanned in the transverse direction perpendicular to the steel girders. Uplift forces caused by the load-bearing behavior of the bridge <b>deck</b> <b>transverse</b> to the bridge axis lead to through-thickness tensile stresses in the adhesive joint. The main objective of this thesis is {{the description of the}} structural behavior in the transverse direction. This includes analysis of the stresses in the adhesive connection as well as determination of the strength of the joints. Analytical and experimental investigations were carried out. It was shown, that the tensile stress distribution in the adhesive joint is non-uniform with high stress concentrations below the FRP deck webs of the cellular deck and above the steel girder web. Alternately inclined deck webs thereby induce significantly higher stresses below the vertical webs. A method for the calculation of the stress state in the adhesive layer is proposed which is validated by numerical and experimental results. The material strength of the connection in terms of a combination of tensile through-thickness and shear stresses is established. The total safety factor of the joint was higher than the safety factor of the FRP deck for bending between the main girders. A possible failure process would not start in the adhesive connection between bridge deck and steel girder which eventually could lead to additional failure of other structural members. The system is redundant. Fatigue loading up to 10 million cycles showed no stiffness degradation. The results of this thesis prove the existence of a good load-bearing behavior under static and fatigue loads of adhesively-bonded joints between pultruded FRP bridge decks and structural steel girders, where the adhesive connection is loaded with uplift forces and moments acting in the bridge deck, in addition to the shear in the connection layer due to composite action. The basis for a design method for adhesively-bonded connections between pultruded FRP bridge decks and steel girders is provided...|$|E

The cracking has been observed in reinforced concrete bridge decks in the State of Florida and in other bridges around the nation.

Several studies investigated the issue of deck cracking (ACI 2001; Altoubat and Lange 2000; Cady et al. 1971; Eppers et al. 1998; Frosch et al. 2003; Krauss and Rogalla 1996; PCA 1970; Purvis et al. 1995; Saadeghvaziri and Hadidi 2002; Schmitt and Darwin 1995; Xi et al. 2003).
