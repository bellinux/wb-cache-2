40|$|Abstract – Underground {{systems are}} {{normally}} exposed to permanent faults, due to specific construction charac-teristics. In these systems, visual inspection {{can only be}} performed through <b>inspection</b> <b>boxes.</b> To overcome this limitation, accurate fault location techniques must be applied. In this paper, a novel impedance-based fault location algorithm for underground distribution systems is described considering three-phase faults. The formulation is developed on the phase frame representation and calcu-lates the apparent impedance using line’s voltage and current data from one-terminal. The technique also pro-poses an iterative algorithm for capacitive current com-pensation. Test simulations on a real data underground distribution system demonstrate the proposed method robustness and accuracy. The algorithm performance presents negligible effects from different fault resistances and fault distances...|$|R

This initial method of power provision survived until 1919 when this was replaced with overhead wires. The reason for the replacement was that gas leaked from the mains which {{found its way into}} the electric power cable conduit. This appeared in a startling and dangerous manner, as the gas ignitied by the arcing of the magnetic switches, with the result that the cast iron covers for the <b>inspection</b> <b>boxes</b> were blown off, and on more than one occasion, hurled into the air. To minimise the risk of explosion, and electric blower was installed at the Depot, and was started up every morning before the first car left the Depot, and this blew a current of air through the conduit, clearing it of any gas.|$|R

40|$|Many saproxylic insects have {{declined}} or became extinct, mainly due to habitat loss and fragmentation, and their survival increasingly depends on active conservation. Efforts {{to achieve this}} goal may be supported by the introduction of new methods, including creation of artificial habitats. Here we present results of studies on the use of wooden boxes mimicking tree cavities for an endangered saproxylic species, Osmoderma barnabita. Boxes were filled with the feeding substrate for larvae and installed on trees. Second and third-instar O. barnabita larvae were introduced in half of the boxes; the remaining ones were left uninhabited. Later <b>inspection</b> of <b>boxes</b> showed a high survival rate of introduced larvae, as well as successful breeding of a new generation inside the boxes. At the same time boxes were not colonized by the local population of O. barnabita, although other cetoniids did so. The co-occurring larvae of other cetoniids did not affect O. barnabita larvae. Thermal conditions inside boxes and natural tree cavities were almost identical and {{based on the results of}} our studies we conclude that wooden boxes may serve as temporary habitat for O. barnabita. They may be particularly useful in cases of destruction of species natural habitat, in restoration programs, and have the potential to act as a stepping stones in cases of a lack of habitat continuity.

40|$|The {{temperature}} {{in a concrete}} bridge is affected by complex interactions of climatic factors. Varying concrete temperature will give rise to movements in the longitudinal {{as well as the}} transverse directions. <b>Inspections</b> of certain <b>box</b> girder bridges have shown cracks in only the thin vertical walls, which may be an indication of a geometrical influence. A sequence of climate input data deemed as an extreme event in a previous study was used to calculate the transverse thermal stresses in concrete box-sections with various geometries. The results show that the most influencing geometrical parameter is the member thickness ratio. If the thicknesses in the horizontal slabs and the vertical walls are different, large tensile stresses will occur in the section. The actual thickness is not as important, nor whether the slabs or walls are the thinner parts. The width and height of the cross-section is not as influential as the thickness ratio...|$|R
30|$|In this paper, we jointly {{consider}} user queue {{priority and}} the RBs capacity {{to develop a}} buffer-aware adaptive resource allocation scheme in LTE transmission systems. Under the constraint of finite buffer space, the proposed scheme aims for improving both the overall system throughput and the statistic QoS while keeping certain fairness among users. We derived an analytical formula based on the large deviation principle invoked for estimating the overflow probability {{as a function of}} the buffer variance. Also, the remaining life time of a queue was defined, and its estimation model was presented. Both the queue overflow probability and remaining life time were applied to determine the queue priority. According to the queue priority, an online measurement based algorithm was proposed to schedule RBs for adjusting the service rate of the user queues. The proposed algorithm does not rely on any prior knowledge about network conditions. Numerical results show that compared to traditional scheduling schemes, the proposed algorithm has a better tradeoff among throughput, fairness, and QoS. It improves the average system throughput and keeps a better fairness among users, while reducing the average BLR. It should be pointed out that this paper considered all the traffic at the eNodeB. However, the emerging technology of SDN and middle deep packet <b>inspection</b> (DPI) <b>boxes</b> can be applied to identify the traffic. Hence, we will consider the application aware scheduling in our future work with the aid of SDN and DPI.|$|R
40|$|Four {{methods for}} {{detecting}} household infestations with Panstrongylus megistus were compared: 1) manual collection; 2) collection after pyrethrum application; 3) search viable eggs; and 4) Gomez-Nuñez boxes. Manual collection {{was the most}} sensitive method (23 % infested), followed by pyrethrum (21 %), Gomez-Nuñez boxes (15 %) and viable eggs (12 %). About 10 % of infested houses were positive exclusively on the Gomez-Nuñez box test.

Inspection of the tank floor is usually conducted using magnetic flux leakage methods but it is recognised that this cannot be applied to the detection of cracking in the welds joining the plates. The paper describes recent developments of the ACFM technique and describes several case studies where ACFM has been used to inspect the internal plate welds on large steel storage tanks in refineries [...] For weld inspection, conventional methods such as magnetic particle <b>inspection</b> or vacuum <b>box</b> testing are generally used.

After analysis had been performed, {{the crack in the}} tube strongly indicate that stress corrosion cracking was occurred by chloride. Chloride stress corrosion cracking (CLSCC) is the cracking occurred by the combined influence of tensile stress and a corrosive environment. CLSCC is the {{one of the most common}} reasons why austenitic stainless steel pipework or tube and vessels deteriorate in the chemical processing, petrochemical industries and maritime industries. In this thesis purpose to determine the appropriate inspection planning for two main items (tubes and header box) in the gas-cooling heat exchanger using risk based inspection (RBI) method. The result, inspection of the tubes must be performed on July 6, 2024 and for the header <b>box</b> <b>inspection</b> must be performed on July 6, 2025. In the end, RBI method can be applicated to gas-cooling heat exchanger. Because, risk on the tubes can be reduced from 4. 537 m 2 /year to 0. 453 m 2 /year.

40|$|The three box-nesting {{passerine}} {{bird species}} pied flycatcher, great tit and common redstart breed at their distributional limit in Troms, Northern Norway. Access to food and favourable weather conditions {{is expected to}} be of importance for the birds´ breeding population dynamics. In the same area, geometrid moth larvae experience cyclic population outbreaks at approx. 10 year intervals, constituting a superabundant and potentially important source of food for insectivorous birds during the breeding season. To assess if the birds´ breeding population dynamics could be explained by moth larval densities and summer temperatures, we conducted yearly <b>inspections</b> of nest <b>box</b> occupancy and moth larval counts during a period of 13 years at 12 study sites, and obtained temperature measurements from nearby weather stations. Results from GLMM models with a logit link function suggested a moderate positive numerical response of the bird community to high moth larval densities. The response was species specific, with the great tit showing the most consistent response – indicating that this species is probably more dependent on moth larvae during breeding season than the other two bird species. The bird community also showed a positive numerical response the year after high summer temperatures, likely because it caused higher breeding success and subsequent higher return rates of breeding birds. It was concluded that the focal bird community was positively affected by high moth larval densities and summer temperatures, but that other factors were probably also limiting on breeding population densities due to the moderate response...|$|R
40|$|Probability of {{detection}} (PoD) studies are broadly {{used to determine}} the reliability of specific nondestructive inspection procedures, as well as to provide data for damage tolerance life estimations and calculation of inspection intervals for critical components. They require inspections on a large set of samples, a fact that makes these statistical assessments time- and cost-consuming. Physics-based numerical simulations of nondestructive testing inspections {{could be used as a}} cost-effective alternative to empirical investigations. They realistically predict the inspection outputs as functions of the input characteristics related to the test piece, transducer and instrument settings, which are subsequently used to partially substitute and/or complement inspection data in PoD analysis. This work focuses on the numerical modelling aspects of eddy current testing for the bolt hole <b>inspections</b> of wing <b>box</b> structures typical of the Lockheed Martin C- 130 Hercules and P- 3 Orion aircraft, found in the air force inventory of many countries. Boundary element-based numerical modelling software was employed to predict the eddy current signal responses when varying inspection parameters related to probe characteristics, crack geometry and test piece properties. Two demonstrator exercises were used for eddy current signal prediction when lowering the driver probe frequency and changing the material's electrical conductivity, followed by subsequent discussions and examination of the implications on using simulated data in the PoD analysis. Despite some simplifying assumptions, the modelled eddy current signals were found to provide similar results to the actual inspections. It is concluded that physics-based numerical simulations have the potential to partially substitute or complement inspection data required for PoD studies, reducing the cost, time, effort and resources necessary for a full empirical PoD assessment. 9 2011 Taylor & Francis.

50|$|Werner C. von Clemm (27 September 1897 - 14 April 1989, Biddeford, Maine) {{was born}} into a German family that married into German nobility, the Nazi party and {{prominent}} American families. His father-in-law was a Vice President of Citibank. In 1922 he immigrated to the United States. Prior to this he had served in the German army during World War I. He was a representative of the German international banking firm Hardy & Co. and an employee of the Pioneer Import Corp., which imported materials from Germany and handled his cousin and Nazi diplomat, Joachim von Ribbentrop's champagne business. Along with his twin brother, Karl he had become friends with U.S. oil man, William Rhodes Davis. In the United States Werner became Vice President of Davis' company Davis & Co., which shipped large quantities of oil to Germany and became a propaganda strategist and financial aid of the America First Committee, which encouraged American isolationism. In 1940 the Nazis seized large quantities of diamonds from Belgium and the Netherlands, which Werner was smuggling to the U.S. The United States was neutral and did not declare war until December 1941. To avoid detection he moved the diamonds through various European cities, shipped them to South America and they eventually found their way to New York City. The operation was stumbled upon by mistake by agents of the Treasury Department when they searched a Budweiser beer box being carried by two American soldiers of German descent. On <b>inspection</b> of the <b>box</b> they found it had a false bottom under which were one hundred letters and government bonds. The letters detailed Werner's diamond smuggling operation. After further investigation von Clemm was arrested on 28 January 1942 and was sentenced to two years in prison for his crime. On his release he entered private banking. He was also an agent of the German intelligence agency, Abwehr and was involved in espionage during World War II.|$|R
40|$|The {{density and}} the {{distribution}} of lesser noctule (Nyctalus leisleri) can be conditioned by the structural heterogeneity and the availability of cavities in the wooden habitat. On the other hand, ecological factors as the trophic availability or the protection from predators probably are also conditioned by the forest structure. At the same time, wood structures depend on the management made on the forests. In order to answer these questions, the structure of beeches forests has been specialized in relation to relevant parameters for the use of nest boxes and noctule population has been sampled in different structures of beech forests in North–East of Catalonia. Therefore, it has determined the activity by means of <b>inspection</b> of nest <b>boxes.</b> They have been reviewed periodically in summer, winter and autumn during 2006 and 2014 a total of 382 nest boxes localized in different kind of beech forests. The results we got in the characterization of the different beech forests show a big contrast between them depending on the management to what they are being subjected : It is evident a decrease in structural heterogeneity and availability of cavities in immature beech woods and defectives. Whereas the results obtained for the taxes of occupation show an increase of the activity of the nest boxes in diminishing the maturity of the forests masses. It has been observed how the mature beech forests and the mature under silvicultural management, registered some taxes of low activity, whereas beech clarified woods and coppice woods registered a much higher occupancy rates. It has been observed also as a good forest specialist, the small noctule tends to occupy much more boxes located inside the forest, probably in search of greater thermal comfort and protection from predation. The maturity of the forests and, consequently, the management done on them, can influence in the distribution of lesser noctule on a wider geographic scale as it could be in a massif or in a country. It is recommended to focus the forest management of the beech woods of Catalonia on a way to promote the density of big trees with cavities in the trunk, as well as the interspecific heterogeneity and vegetative layers. It also presents as a valid alternative to try to stabilize the populations of small noctules, the location of nest boxes in beech forests where the natural shelter are scarc...|$|R
