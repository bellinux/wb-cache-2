50|$|The Snowy River {{originally}} {{had a huge}} flow during the spring snow-melt which flowed directly into the sea.

Several hydro-electric power stations were also constructed to generate electricity. While there was initial public opposition to the diversion of the river's water during the 1950s and '60s, it was largely ignored as the scheme provided agriculture with more water and generated a large amount of jobs at the time.|$|E
