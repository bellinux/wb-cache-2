5|$|<b>Dysphagia</b> and dysarthria: <b>dysphagia</b> is a {{difficulty}} with eating and swallowing which may cause choking and aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs, while dysarthria is a neurological motor speech disorder characterized by poor {{control over the}} subsystems and muscles responsible for speech ("articulation"). A {{speech and language therapist}} may give advice on specific swallowing techniques, on adapting food consistencies and dietary intake, on techniques to improve and maintain speech production and clarity, and on alternative communication approaches. In the case of advanced <b>dysphagia,</b> food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube, which is a tube that goes through the nose directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG), which is a procedure for placing a tube into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. This second system, although more invasive, has better results in the long term than nasogastric intake.|$|E
5|$|EMA {{is used in}} {{linguistics}} and speech pathology to study articulation and in medicine to study oropharyngeal <b>dysphagia.</b> Unlike other methods of data collection, EMA does not expose subjects to ionizing radiation and allows for large amounts of data to be collected easily.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{sclerosis}} {{can cause}} a variety of symptoms including changes in sensation (hypoesthesia), muscle weakness, abnormal muscle spasms, impaired movement, difficulties with coordination and balance, problems in speech (known as dysarthria) or swallowing (<b>dysphagia),</b> visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis, or diplopia), fatigue and acute or chronic pain syndromes, bladder and bowel difficulties, cognitive impairment, or emotional symptoms (mainly depression). At the same time for each symptom there are different treatment options. Treatments should therefore be individualized depending both on {{the patient and the}} physician.|$|E
5|$|The local {{symptoms}} of victims bitten by the many-banded krait are usually neither serious swelling nor pain; the victims merely feel slightly itchy and numb. Systemic symptoms occur, in general, one {{to six hours}} after being bitten by this snake. Symptoms may include bilateral ptosis, diplopia, discomfort in the chest, general ache, weak feeling in limbs, ataxia, glossolysis, loss of voice, <b>dysphagia,</b> tunnel vision, and difficulty breathing. In case of serious bite, suppression of breathing may occur, leading to death. Hyponatremia is also seen, but less commonly.|$|E
5|$|Muscles and nerves {{that control}} the {{digestive}} process may be affected by PD, resulting in constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach {{for a longer period}} than normal). A balanced diet, based on periodical nutritional assessments, is recommended and should be designed to avoid weight loss or gain and minimize consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction. As the disease advances, swallowing difficulties (<b>dysphagia)</b> may appear. In such cases it may be helpful to use thickening agents for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating, both measures reducing the risk of choking. Gastrostomy to deliver food directly into the stomach is possible in severe cases.|$|E
5|$|Several {{disorders}} {{affect the}} motility of food as it travels down the esophagus. This can cause difficult swallowing, called <b>dysphagia,</b> or painful swallowing, called odynophagia. Achalasia {{refers to a}} failure of the lower esophageal sphincter to relax properly, and generally develops later in life. This leads to progressive enlargement of the esophagus, and possibly eventual megaesophagus. A nutcracker esophagus refers to swallowing that can be extremely painful. Diffuse esophageal spasm is a spasm of the esophagus that can be one cause of chest pain. Such referred pain to the wall of the upper chest is quite common in esophageal conditions. Sclerosis of the esophagus, such as with systemic sclerosis or in CREST syndrome may cause hardening of the walls of the esophagus and interfere with peristalsis.|$|E
5|$|Video {{fluoroscopy}} uses {{x-ray radiation}} to produce moving {{pictures of the}} mouth during articulation or swallowing. It is considered the gold standard in studies of <b>dysphagia</b> because {{of its ability to}} take videos of the entire digestive tract during swallowing events. It is often used to study and treat aspiration of food, what parts of the digestive tract are malfunctioning during swallowing, and positions in which swallowing is easiest. Only limited data is able to be collected as sessions are typically limited to three minutes due to the hazards of radiation exposure. and it does not allow for fine grain analysis of tongue movements.|$|E
5|$|Weight {{loss and}} eating {{difficulties}} due to <b>dysphagia</b> and other muscle discoordination are common, making nutrition management increasingly {{important as the}} disease advances. Thickening agents {{can be added to}} liquids as thicker fluids are easier and safer to swallow. Reminding the affected person to eat slowly and to take smaller pieces of food into the mouth may also be of use to prevent choking. If eating becomes too hazardous or uncomfortable, the option of using a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy is available. This is a feeding tube, permanently attached through the abdomen into the stomach, which reduces the risk of aspirating food and provides better nutritional management. Assessment and management by speech-language pathologists with experience in Huntington's disease is recommended.|$|E
5|$|The basal ganglia—the part of {{the brain}} most {{prominently}} affected in early HD—play a key role in movement and behavior control. Their functions are not fully understood, but current theories propose that they are {{part of the}} cognitive executive system and the motor circuit. The basal ganglia ordinarily inhibit a large number of circuits that generate specific movements. To initiate a particular movement, the cerebral cortex sends a signal to the basal ganglia that causes the inhibition to be released. Damage to the basal ganglia can cause the release or reinstatement of the inhibitions to be erratic and uncontrolled, which results in an awkward start to motion or motions to be unintentionally initiated, or a motion to be halted before, or beyond, its intended completion. The accumulating damage to this area causes the characteristic erratic movements associated with HD. The spontaneous and erratic physical movements associated with HD are classified as a type of hyperkinetic dysarthria. Because of the basal ganglia's inability to inhibit movements, individuals affected by it will inevitably experience a reduced ability to produce speech and swallow foods and liquids (<b>dysphagia).</b>|$|E
25|$|Functional <b>dysphagia</b> {{is defined}} in some {{patients}} as having no organic cause for <b>dysphagia</b> that can be found.|$|E
25|$|The {{interpretation}} of standard barium swallow examinations for assessing <b>dysphagia</b> is operator and interpreter dependent. It has poor sensitivity for subtle abnormalities but is more sensitive in detecting esophageal webs and rings than gastroscopy. The best initial evaluation of suspected oropharyngeal <b>dysphagia</b> is a barium study. Barium swallow studies remain the main investigation of <b>dysphagia.</b> Barium studies may detect pharyngeal tumors {{that are difficult}} to visualize endoscopically.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dysphagia</b> (difficulty swallowing).|$|E
25|$|<b>Dysphagia</b> is {{a symptom}} of many {{different}} causes, which can usually be elicited through a careful history by the treating physician. A formal oropharyngeal <b>dysphagia</b> evaluation is performed by a medical speech pathologist or occupational therapist.|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} ways to treat <b>dysphagia,</b> such as {{swallowing}} therapy, dietary changes, feeding tubes, certain medications, and surgery. Treatments for <b>dysphagia</b> will be managed by a group of specialists known as a multidisciplinary team.|$|E
25|$|Sideropenic <b>dysphagia</b> {{can cause}} glossitis, angular cheilitis.|$|E
25|$|Complications of <b>dysphagia</b> {{may include}} aspiration, pneumonia, dehydration, and weight loss.|$|E
25|$|If {{swallowing}} problems (<b>dysphagia)</b> occur, {{they typically}} present {{during the second}} decade of life. <b>Dysphagia</b> is common because of the neurological changes that interfere with coordination of mouth and pharynx (throat) movements that are needed for safe and efficient swallowing. Coordination problems involving the mouth may make chewing difficult and increase the duration of meals. Problems involving the pharynx may cause liquid, food, and saliva to be inhaled into the airway (aspiration). People with <b>dysphagia</b> may not cough when they aspirate (silent aspiration). Swallowing problems and especially swallowing problems with silent aspiration may cause lung problems due to inability to cough and clear food and liquids from the airway.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dysphagia</b> – {{difficulty}} swallowing and chewing, {{especially when}} eating dry foods. Food may {{stick to the}} tissues during eating.|$|E
25|$|Rare (<0.1% of patients): neutropenia, {{first degree}} heart block, hypotension, hypertension, pancreatitis, <b>dysphagia,</b> oliguria, rhabdomyolysis, suicidal {{thoughts}} or behavior.|$|E
25|$|Swallowing {{sounds and}} {{vibrations}} could be potentially used for <b>dysphagia</b> screening, but these approaches {{are in the}} early research stages.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dysphagia</b> may {{manifest}} as {{the result}} of autonomic nervous system pathologies including stroke and ALS, or due to rapid iatrogenic correction of an electrolyte imbalance.|$|E
25|$|A {{frequently}} occurring {{motor deficit}} is left-sided hemiparesis (in strokes affecting the motor cortex). A less common motor deficit {{in this population}} is <b>dysphagia.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of oropharyngeal <b>dysphagia</b> include difficulty controlling food in the mouth, inability to control food or saliva in the mouth, difficulty initiating a swallow, coughing, choking, frequent pneumonia, unexplained weight loss, gurgly or wet voice after swallowing, nasal regurgitation, and <b>dysphagia</b> (patient complaint of swallowing difficulty). When asked where the food is getting stuck, patients will often point to the cervical (neck) region as the site of the obstruction. The actual site of obstruction is always at or below the level at which the level of obstruction is perceived.|$|E
25|$|Esophageal <b>dysphagia</b> {{is almost}} always caused by disease in or {{adjacent}} to the esophagus but occasionally the lesion is in the pharynx or stomach. In many of the pathological conditions causing <b>dysphagia,</b> the lumen becomes progressively narrowed and indistensible. Initially only fibrous solids cause difficulty but later the problem can extend to all solids and later even to liquids. Patients with difficulty swallowing may benefit from thickened fluids {{if the person is}} more comfortable with those liquids, although, so far, there are no scientific study that proves that those thickened liquids are beneficial.|$|E
25|$|Swallowing {{disorders}} include {{difficulties in}} any {{system of the}} swallowing process (i.e. oral, pharyngeal, esophageal), as well as functional <b>dysphagia</b> and feeding disorders. Swallowing disorders can occur at any age and can stem from multiple causes.|$|E
25|$|A {{third of}} all people with a thymoma have {{symptoms}} caused by compression of the surrounding organs by an expansive mass. These problems may {{take the form of}} superior vena cava syndrome, <b>dysphagia</b> (difficulty swallowing), cough, or chest pain.|$|E
25|$|Reported toxicities include {{dry mouth}} (xerostomia) from salivary gland damage, 18% (grade 2); {{difficulty}} swallowing (<b>dysphagia)</b> from {{damage to the}} constrictor muscles, larynx and oesophageal sphincter, 15% (grade 2); subclinical aspiration up to 50% (reported incidence of aspiration pneumonia approximately 14%); hypothyroidism 28–38% at three years (may be up to 55% depending on amount of the thyroid gland exposed to over 45Gy radiation; esophageal stenosis 5%; osteonecrosis of the mandible 2.5%; and need for a gastrostomy tube to be placed {{at some point during}} or up to one year after treatment 4% (up to 16% with longer follow up). Concerns have been expressed regarding excessive short and long term toxicity, especially <b>dysphagia</b> and xerostomia, and hence whether standard doses expose patients with better prognoses are being exposed to overtreatment and unnecessary side effects.|$|E
25|$|Juvenile Tay–Sachs disease. Juvenile Tay–Sachs {{disease is}} rarer than {{other forms of}} Tay–Sachs, and usually is {{initially}} seen in children between two and ten years old. People with Tay–Sachs disease develop cognitive and motor skill deterioration, dysarthria, <b>dysphagia,</b> ataxia, and spasticity. Death usually occurs between {{the age of five}} to fifteen years.|$|E
25|$|Achalasia {{is a major}} {{exception}} to usual pattern of <b>dysphagia</b> in that swallowing of fluid tends to cause more difficulty than swallowing solids. In achalasia, there is idiopathic destruction of parasympathetic ganglia of the Auerbach's (Myenteric) plexus of the entire esophagus, which results in functional narrowing of the lower esophagus, and peristaltic failure throughout its length.|$|E
25|$|Swallowing {{disorders}} {{can occur}} in all age groups, resulting from congenital abnormalities, structural damage, and/or medical conditions. Swallowing problems are a common complaint among older individuals, and the incidence of <b>dysphagia</b> is higher in the elderly, in patients who have had strokes, and in patients who are admitted to acute care hospitals or chronic care facilities.|$|E
25|$|If {{there is}} <b>dysphagia</b> or {{dyspnoea}} (difficulty swallowing or breathing), then this usually {{means there is}} a severe infection and an emergency admission to hospital is appropriate so that intravenous medications and fluids can be administered and {{the threat to the}} airway monitored. Sometimes semi-emergency surgery may be arranged to drain a swelling that is threatening the airway.|$|E
25|$|While {{comparison}} with historical controls has limited value compared to randomised clinical trials (phase III), phase II studies using reduced doses of radiation {{compared to the}} historical standard of 70Gy have been carried out. A study using 54–60Gy (a 15–20% reduction, stratified by response to initial induction chemotherapy) demonstrated comparable levels of disease control with much lower complication rates, when compared to similar studies, using 70Gy, such as ECOG 2399. The percentage of patients alive after 2 years were 95% at the higher dose and 98% at the lower dose. Similarly for the percentage free of disease (86 and 92%). Toxicities were greatly reduced from an incidence of grade 3 or greater <b>dysphagia</b> and mucositis of 54 and 53% respectively, to 9%. A lower incidence and severity of <b>dysphagia</b> also means that less patients require gastrostomy feeding. A similar comparison {{can be made with}} the pooled data from two RTOG studies which utilized 70Gy (0129 and 0522).|$|E
25|$|In cattle, the {{symptoms}} may include drooling, restlessness, uncoordination, urine retention, <b>dysphagia,</b> and sternal recumbency. Laterally recumbent animals are usually {{very close to}} death. In sheep, {{the symptoms}} may include drooling, a serous nasal discharge, stiffness, and incoordination. Abdominal respiration may be observed and the tail may switch on the side. As the disease progresses, the limbs may become paralyzed and death may occur.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} symptom of esophageal <b>dysphagia</b> is the {{inability}} to swallow solid food, which the patient will describe as 'becoming stuck' or 'held up' before it either passes into the stomach or is regurgitated. Pain on swallowing or odynophagia is a distinctive symptom that can be highly indicative of carcinoma, although it also has numerous other causes that {{are not related to}} cancer.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{may have}} {{particular}} problems, such as <b>dysphagia,</b> {{which can cause}} swallowed material to pass into the lungs and cause aspiration pneumonia. The condition may improve with time, but in the interim, a nasogastric tube may be inserted, enabling liquid food to be given directly into the stomach. If swallowing is still deemed unsafe, then a percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) tube is passed and this can remain indefinitely.|$|E
25|$|The {{probability}} of xerostomia at one year increases by 5% for every 1Gy increase in dose to the parotid gland. Doses above 25–30Gy {{are associated with}} moderate to severe xerostomia. Similar considerations apply to the submandibular gland, but xerostomia is less common if only one parotid gland {{is included in the}} radiated field and the contralateral submandibular gland is spared (less than 39Gy) In the same manner, radiation dose to the pharyngeal constrictor muscles, larynx, and cricopharyngeal inlet determine the risk of <b>dysphagia</b> (and hence dependence on gastrostomy tube feeds). The threshold for this toxicity is volume-dependent at 55–60Gy, with moderate to severe impairment of swallowing, including aspiration, stricture and feeding tube dependence above a mean dose of 47Gy, with a recommended dose to the inferior constrictor of less than 41Gy. Dose-toxicity relationships for the superior and middle constrictors are steep, with a 20% increase in the {{probability of}} <b>dysphagia</b> for each 10Gy. Doses above 30Gy to the thyroid are associated with moderate to severe hypothyroidism. Subjective, patient-reported outcomes of quality of life also correlate with radiation dose received.|$|E
