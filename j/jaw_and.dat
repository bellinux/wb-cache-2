5|$|Diastema is a {{condition}} {{in which there is a}} gap between two teeth caused by the imbalance in the relationship between the <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> the size of teeth.|$|E
5|$|Georges Dumézil {{theorized that}} Víðarr {{represents}} a cosmic figure from an archetype {{derived from the}} Proto-Indo-Europeans. Dumézil stated that he was aligned with both vertical space, due to his placement of {{his foot on the}} wolf's lower <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> his hand on the wolf's upper <b>jaw,</b> <b>and</b> horizontal space, due to his wide step and strong shoe, and that, by killing the wolf, Víðarr keeps the wolf from destroying the cosmos, and the cosmos can thereafter be restored after the destruction resulting from Ragnarök.|$|E
5|$|Shark {{teeth are}} {{embedded}} in the gums rather than directly affixed to the <b>jaw,</b> <b>and</b> are constantly replaced throughout life. Multiple rows of replacement teeth grow in a groove {{on the inside of}} the <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> steadily move forward in comparison to a conveyor belt; some sharks lose 30,000 or more teeth in their lifetime. The rate of tooth replacement varies from once every 8 to 10 days to several months. In most species, teeth are replaced one at a time as opposed to the simultaneous replacement of an entire row, which is observed in the cookiecutter shark.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pattern in}} most of the {{following}} sections is that each successive more [...] "advanced" [...] group started with the more [...] "primitive" [...] <b>jaws</b> <b>and</b> ears of its predecessors, then developed more mammal-like <b>jaws</b> <b>and</b> ears, and so on. The evolution of mammalian <b>jaw</b> joints <b>and</b> ears did not proceed neatly in lockstep with the evolution of other mammalian features. In other words, <b>jaw</b> joints <b>and</b> ears do not define any except the last of the various stages into which paleontologists divide the evolution towards the mammalian anatomy.|$|R
50|$|<b>Jaws</b> <b>and</b> teeth: Tyrannosaurus had {{powerful}} <b>jaws</b> <b>and</b> robust teeth. Horner {{argue that}} Tyrannosaurus used them for crushing bones, as modern scavengers like hyenas do {{to feed on}} marrow when the flesh of carcass has rotted away. Predators teeth are normally thin and sharp for slicing flesh.|$|R

5|$|Tuataras superficially {{resemble}} lizards but the lineages diverged in the Triassic period. There is one living species, Sphenodon punctatus. The skull has two openings (fenestrae) {{on either}} side and the jaw is rigidly attached to the skull. There is one row of teeth in the lower <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> this fits between the two rows in the upper jaw when the animal chews. The teeth are merely projections of bony material from the <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> eventually wear down. The brain and heart are more primitive than those of other reptiles, and the lungs have a single chamber and lack bronchi. The tuatara has a well-developed parietal eye on its forehead.|$|E
5|$|Dermotherium is a genus {{of fossil}} mammals {{closely related to}} the living colugos, a small group of gliding mammals from Southeast Asia. Two species are recognized: D.major from the Late Eocene of Thailand, based on a single {{fragment}} of the lower <b>jaw,</b> <b>and</b> D.chimaera from the Late Oligocene of Thailand, known from three fragments of the lower <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> two isolated upper molars. In addition, a single isolated upper molar from the Early Oligocene of Pakistan has been tentatively assigned to D.chimaera. All sites where fossils of Dermotherium have been found probably developed in forested environments and the fossil species probably were forest dwellers like living colugos, but whether they already had the gliding adaptations of the living species is unknown.|$|E

5|$|Jaw joint - The dentary (the {{lower jaw}} bone, which carries the teeth) and the squamosal (a small cranial bone) meet {{to form the}} joint. In most gnathostomes, {{including}} early therapsids, the joint consists of the articular (a small bone {{at the back of}} the lower <b>jaw)</b> <b>and</b> quadrate (a small bone {{at the back of the}} upper jaw).|$|E
5|$|Like most known tyrannosaurids, Tarbosaurus {{was a large}} bipedal predator, {{weighing}} up to five tonnes and equipped with about sixty large teeth. It had a unique locking mechanism in its lower <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> the smallest forelimbs relative to body size of all tyrannosaurids, renowned for their disproportionately tiny, two-fingered forelimbs.|$|E
5|$|Maxillae and a {{lacrimal}} (the main tooth-bearing {{bones of}} the upper <b>jaw,</b> <b>and</b> the bone that forms the anterior margin of the eye socket, respectively) recovered in 1999 by the Sino-Belgian Dinosaur Expeditions were found to pertain to Velociraptor, {{but not to the}} type species V. mongoliensis. Pascal Godefroit and colleagues named these bones V. osmolskae (for Polish paleontologist Halszka Osmólska) in 2008.|$|E

5|$|Methamphetamine users {{sometimes}} experience soreness in {{the joint}} of the <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> dental attrition (tooth wear), owing to bruxism (grinding of the teeth) caused by the drug. This bruxism can occur continuously. Chronic use of the drug might also cause trismus, the inability to open the jaw. Long-term users often experience xerostomia (dry mouth).|$|E

5|$|The bat has a {{distinctive}} swollen, pig-like snout with thin, vertical nostrils. Its ears are relatively large, while its eyes {{are small and}} mostly concealed by fur. Its teeth are typical of an insectivorous bat. The dental formula is 1:1:1:3 in the upper <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> 2:1:2:3 in the lower jaw, with large upper incisors.|$|E

5|$|Amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew {{it lightly}} first to subdue it. They {{typically}} have small hinged pedicellate teeth, a feature unique to amphibians. The base and crown {{of these are}} composed of dentine separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals. Salamanders, caecilians and some frogs {{have one or two}} rows of teeth in both jaws, but some frogs (Rana spp.) lack teeth in the lower <b>jaw,</b> <b>and</b> toads (Bufo spp.) have no teeth. In many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|At metamorphosis, {{rapid changes}} in the body take place as the {{lifestyle}} of the frog changes completely. The spiral‐shaped mouth with horny tooth ridges is reabsorbed together with the spiral gut. The animal develops a large <b>jaw,</b> <b>and</b> its gills disappear along with its gill sac. Eyes and legs grow quickly, and a tongue is formed. There are associated {{changes in the}} neural networks such as development of stereoscopic vision and loss of the lateral line system. All this can happen in about a day. A few days later, the tail is reabsorbed, due to the higher thyroxine concentration required for this to take place.|$|E
25|$|Sauropods, {{which were}} herbivores, did not chew their food, as their teeth <b>and</b> <b>jaws</b> appear {{suitable}} only for stripping leaves off plants.

The armored ankylosaurs and stegosaurs had small heads <b>and</b> weak <b>jaws</b> <b>and</b> teeth, and {{are thought to have}} fed {{in much the same way}} as sauropods. The pachycephalosaurs had small heads <b>and</b> weak <b>jaws</b> <b>and</b> teeth, but their lack of large digestive systems suggests a different diet, possibly fruits, seeds, or young shoots, which would have been more nutritious to them than leaves.|$|R

5|$|I. hollingtoniensis (also spelled I. hollingtonensis), {{described}} by Lydekker in 1889, has variously {{been considered a}} synonym of Hypselospinus fittoni or a distinct species assigned to the genus Huxleysaurus. A specimen from the Valanginian Wadhurst Clay Formation, variously assigned to I. hollingtoniensis and I. mantelli over the years, has an unusual combination of hadrosaurid-like lower <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> very robust forelimb; Norman (2010) assigned this specimen to the species Hypselospinus fittoni, while Paul (2012) made it the holotype of a separate species Darwinsaurus evolutionis.|$|E
5|$|In the mandible, the {{diastema}} (gap) {{between the}} incisors and the cheekteeth (premolars and molars) is relatively deep. The mental foramen (an {{opening in the}} bone) is located relatively high and before the p4. The upper and lower masseteric ridges, which are located on the outer side of the <b>jaw</b> <b>and</b> anchor some of the chewing muscles, meet at the m1. The surfaces of the incisor are very flat, but there are small, irregular striations in the enamel {{along the length of}} the tooth.|$|E
