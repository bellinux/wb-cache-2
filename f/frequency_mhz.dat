Dynamic strains applied to the sensor change the optical path-length between the grating-mirrors and are encoded as a change in signal-phase. A low-coherence Mach-Zehnder processing interferometer, with a high-frequency phase-carrier in one arm, is used to interrogate the sensor.

Conventionally, a human grader is used to inspect the ripeness of the oil palm fresh fruit bunch (FFB) which can be inconsistent and inaccurate. There are various new methods that are proposed with the intention to grade the ripeness of the oil palm FFB, but none has taken the inductive concept. In this study, the resonance frequency of the air coil is investigated.

While there is much research on DC electrical properties of nanowires, electrodynamic characteristics still represent a major new frontier in nanotechnology.

In the cases of silicon nanowires and carbon nanotubes, evidence of strong disorder or glass-like charge dynamics was measured, indicating that these materials still suffer from serious inhomogeneities that limit there high frequency performance.

The dielectric permittivity and {{electrical conductivity}} of kaolin and bentonite were determined at various water contents and NaCl concentrations {{as a function of}} frequency, ranging from 0. 1 kHz to 13 MHz. The results indicate that kaolin and bentonite have similar dielectric behavior. An increase in the frequency produces a decrease in the dielectric permittivity of the soil-pore water mixture. As the ion concentration increases, the dielectric permittivity of the mixture increases at low frequency (kHz) whereas it decreases at high <b>frequency</b> (<b>MHz).</b> The electrical conductivity of kaolin and bentonite increases with an increase in the ion concentration in the soil-water mixture.

This indicates the importance of the surface conductivity of a bentonite-water mixture.

40|$|Bandpass sigma-delta {{modulators}} combine oversampling {{and noise}} shaping {{to get very}} high resolution in a limited bandwidth. They are widely used in applications that require narrowband high-resolution conversion at high frequencies. In recent years interests have been seen in wireless system and software radio using sigma-delta modulators to digitize signals near {{the front end of}} radio receivers. Such applications necessitate clocking the modulators at a high <b>frequency</b> (<b>MHz</b> or above). Therefore a loop filter is required in continuous-time circuits (e. g., using transconductors and integrators) rather than discretetime circuits (e. g., using switched capacitors) where the maximum clocking rate is limited by the bandwidth of Opamp, switch??s speed and settling-time of the circuitry. In this work, the design of a CMOS fourth-order bandpass sigma-delta modulator clocking at 500 MHz for direct conversion of narrowband signals at 125 MHz is presented. A new calibration scheme is proposed for the best signal-to-noise-distortion-ratio (SNDR) of the modulator. The continuous-time loop filter is based on Gm-C resonators. A novel transconductance amplifier has been developed with high linearity at high frequency. Qfactor of filter is enhanced by tunable negative impedance which cancels the finite output impendence of OTA. The fourth-order modulator is implemented using 0. 35 mm triplemetal standard analog CMOS technology.

30|$|The zeta-potential {{value is}} closely related to {{suspension}} stability and particle surface morphology [31, 61]. To calculate ζ-potential from the ESA data, several pieces of information are needed. For the suspending medium, the density, viscosity, and dielectric constant are required. For the particles, the density, volume fraction, and average size are necessary [59, 62]. The electroacoustic ESA technique offers many advantages over traditional microelectrophoresis methods: (1) measurements of electrophoretic mobility and ζ-potential at suspensions with the real solids loading can be made without sample dilution, (2) samples can be stirred during measurements to avoid settling, so automatic titrations in order to obtain zeta-potential vs. pH data are relatively easy to perform, (3) individual measurements are very rapid, allowing the user to track non-equilibrium behavior, (4) a pH-concentration profile for the adsorption of the dispersant onto low and concentrated suspensions of nanosize and ultrafine particle systems, in contrast with the multiple potentiometric titrations that are required by conventional techniques, could be quickly and semiautomatically obtained, and (5) the biggest advantage of ESA measurement, compared with the other techniques, such as laser light scattering, is the capability to characterize interacting concentrated dispersed systems without dilution. However, there are a few limitations which include (i) The precision of the ESA (ESA- 8000, Matec) method depends on the applied <b>frequency</b> (<b>MHz).</b> (ii) The ESA signal for concentrated suspensions with volume fraction of above 20  vol.% is slightly lower at frequency of 1  MHz. (iii) Significant sources of experimental error may include the calibration procedure of the sample, such as the increased viscosity of the suspensions at higher solids loading, especially near the IEP (isoelectric point). These high viscosities can lead to poor mixing properties that result in sample heterogeneity during titrations. Therefore, it is advisable to determine the viscosity behavior of applied suspensions prior to ESA measurements [32, 35, 52].|$|E
40|$|Photovoltaic modules are {{connected}} to the electricity grid via bulky, one or three phase power electronic converters, operating at a relatively low switching frequency [1]. Today, much effort is put in increasing the efficiency and reliability of these power conversions in order to present a cost effective solution to the consumers. More and more this is done by introducing complex circuit topologies, as the used silicon semiconductor devices are reaching their performance limits. However, a new wind is blowing with the introduction of the wide-bandgap semiconductor materials (GaN, SiC, [...] .) for power electronic devices, having many advantages compared to the silicon ones [2, 3, 4]. Especially GaN (Gallium Nitride) is coming more and more in the spotlights as a promising semiconductor material [2, 3, 4] (the first commercially available GaN-product is released in February 2010 [3]). With their very low on-resistance and low gate charges, the GaN transistors allow a further optimisation of the mentioned energy conversion. Much higher switching frequencies are applicable, resulting is a very compact, light and low cost converter design. This could allow the converter to be integrated into the PVpanels, being economically a huge advantage. The goal of this Master thesis is to develop such a high <b>frequency</b> (<b>MHz</b> range), high efficiency, GaN-based PV converter. A major task will be the design of the passive components (inductors, capacitors) as these will become the limiting factor at very high switching frequencies. The primary focus will be on the compactness of the design, rather than on efficiency. The power range will be around 500 W- 1 kW. The thesis will start with a literature study after which a decision for the used topology will be made. Then the circuit parameters will be chosen via an optimization algorithm. This will be followed by the performance of circuit simulations (MATLAB SIMULINK, PSpice) and the design of the passives (inductors, transformers, capacitors). Eventually the converter will be build and tested in the lab under supervision of an assistant. GaN prototype transistors are available to be implemented in the circuit. Reference...|$|E

Due to the relatively high <b>frequency</b> (<b>MHz</b> range), the generated surface vibration velocity is typically ~ 1 m/s with a tremendous acceleration of 107 m/s. For the last decade, SAW have {{found their way into}} a wide range of microfluidic applications, and a fascinating variety of fluid and micro-particle flow phenomena. However, the majority of these applications have been without a deep understanding of the governing physics in conjunction with a systematic experimental study; justifiably, due to the complexity of the interactions of these waves with fluids considering the high frequency used, (MHz range), compared to the natural resonance frequency of these fluids (Hz and KHz range). In this thesis, we demonstrate through experimental, theoretical, and limited numerical study how SAW interacts with microfluidic films and drops, and through the investigation we unravel two novel phenomena of unique fingering instability and soliton-like wave emergence and propagation, although the former — i. e. fingering instability — is akin in appearance to the classical viscous fingering instability, is distinct as the driving mechanism being the SAW diffraction. Beyond elucidating the underlying physics governing SAW-driven thin films, we designed an experimental setup comprising the integration of the SAW with microchannels patterned on a wet paper substrate, where a thin film at the paper’s tip was drawn out using SAW atomisation, which, led to driving the rest of the fluids at the channel’s other ends, leading to fluid mixing along the michrochannels. Mixing was quantified using a novel technique based on hue, which is shown to be more practical solution compared to the commonly known greyscale method, because of the latter’s lack of accuracy with limited colour contrast between fluids. Beyond the thorough experimental and theoretical understanding and integration with paper based microfluids, finally, for cost of effectiveness and simplicity of use we trade off SAW with a similar type of waves, in some aspects known as the Lamb waves to drive a range of microfluidic applications already achieved a SAW. The setup used here is exceptionally simple to the point that, in some cases, only standard aluminium foil is sufficient in simple contact with the lithium niobate substrate to good actuation.
