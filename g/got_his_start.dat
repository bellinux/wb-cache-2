5|$|Dion {{was born}} on August 11, 1918 in Saint-Rémi-de-Tingwick, Quebec and had twelve siblings: six {{brothers}} and six sisters. He <b>got</b> <b>his</b> <b>start</b> as an ice hockey goaltender with the Junior Verdun Maple Leafs of the Quebec Junior Hockey League in 1937 and was selected {{as one of the}} goaltenders for the 1938 Memorial Cup All-Star team. He also played one game with the senior Maple Leafs that season. He served briefly in the Canadian Army in Cornwall, Ontario and also worked as an asbestos miner for Johns Manville prior to quitting that job to play professional hockey.|$|E
5|$|Hubert Humphrey <b>got</b> <b>his</b> <b>start</b> in Minnesota {{politics}} in the early 1940s. He was an organizer of the Minnesota Democratic Party at the time, {{and he realized that}} the party's best chance of success would come if the Minnesota Farmer-Labor Party merged with the Democratic party. Other party leaders had been discussing the merger, but Humphrey's idea was to keep the Farmer-Labor name {{in the name of the}} merged party, in order to gain the strength of thousands of loyal voters. Thus, the party got the name Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party.|$|E
5|$|Alan Grant, {{a writer}} from Scotland, <b>got</b> <b>his</b> <b>start</b> on 2000 AD as an {{assistant}} writer for John Wagner. Grant rose to prominence as an equal of Wagner's {{in the creation of}} Judge Dredd comic strips. These stories were noted favorably for their use of socio-political commentary and satire. Together, the duo acquired employment with DC Comics. Dennis O'Neil assigned them to Detective Comics in 1988, hoping they would bring their gritty, violent take on Judge Dredd to Batman storylines. Soon after, Wagner left the company, leaving Grant to continue the run on his own. Drawing on his work for Judge Dredd, Grant began injecting social commentary into the comic book, and avoided using common Batman rogues in favor of his own creations. Some of these villains were influenced by characters from the Judge Dredd universe. Anarky was conceived singularly by Grant {{as a result of these}} circumstances, and Grant's own intellectual and philosophical meditations influenced the portrayal of the character over the following years.|$|E

One of thirteen children, Dion <b>got</b> <b>his</b> <b>start</b> as a goaltender with the Junior Verdun Maple Leafs in 1937 and had his first full season as a senior with the team the following year. After several seasons in the Quebec Senior and Professional Hockey Leagues, he was recruited by the Red Wings in 1943 as a potential replacement for Johnny Mowers, who had enlisted to fight in World War II. He spent two years with the team, earning a win-loss-tie record of 23–11–4 and {{taking part in the}} most lopsided shutout (15–0) in NHL history as the goalie for the winning side.|$|E
5|$|Merian Caldwell Cooper (October 24, 1893 – April 21, 1973) was an American aviator, United States Air Force and Polish Air Force officer, adventurer, screenwriter, film director, and producer. Cooper was {{the founder}} of the Kościuszko Squadron during the Polish–Soviet War and was a Soviet {{prisoner}} of war for a time. He was a notable movie producer, and <b>got</b> <b>his</b> <b>start</b> with film as part of the Explorers Club, traveling the world and documenting adventures. He {{was a member of the}} board of directors of Pan American Airways, but his love of film always took priority. During his film career, he worked for companies such as Pioneer Pictures, RKO Pictures, and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. He is also credited as co-inventor of the Cinerama film projection process. Cooper's most famous film was the 1933 movie King Kong. He was awarded an honorary Oscar for lifetime achievement in 1952 and received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in 1960.|$|E
5|$|Georgia Tech's mascot Buzz <b>got</b> <b>his</b> <b>start</b> in the 1970s. The {{original}} Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket mascot was Judi McNair who {{donned a}} homemade yellowjacket costume in 1972 and performed at home football games. She rode on the Ramblin' Wreck and {{appears in the}} 1972 Georgia Tech Blueprint yearbook. McNair's mascot was considered a great idea, {{as it was a}} big hit with the fans. In 1979, McNair's idea for a Yellow Jacket was reintroduced by another Georgia Tech student, Richie Bland. Bland, who was apparently unaware of McNair's prior initiative, paid $1,400 to have a local theme park costume designer make a yellowjacket costume that he first wore at a pep rally prior to the Tennessee football game. Rather than obtain permission from Georgia Tech as Judi had done in 1972, this student simply sneaked onto the field in costume during a football game and ran across the field. The fans believed that this costumed character was acting as an official member of the cheerleading squad and responded accordingly. By 1980, this new incarnation of the yellow jacket mascot was given the name Buzz Bee and was adopted as an official mascot by Georgia Tech. This new Buzz character would be the model for a new Georgia Tech emblem, designed in 1985 by Mike Lester.|$|E

He placed 12th in the Men's Free Pistol, 50 metres competition at the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, England. At the 1952 ISSF World Shooting Championships, he won a gold medal with the United States team in the 25 m Center-Fire Pistol event and a silver in the individual version of that event.
