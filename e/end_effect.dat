2500|$|McNamara took {{other steps}} to {{increase}} U.S. deterrence posture and military capabilities. He raised {{the proportion of}} Strategic Air Command (SAC) strategic bombers on 15-minute ground alert from 25% to 50%, thus lessening their vulnerability to missile attack. In December 1961, he established the United States Strike Command (STRICOM). Authorized to draw forces when needed from the Strategic Army Corps (STRAC), the Tactical Air Command, and the airlift units of the Military Air Transport Service and the military services, Strike Command had the mission [...] "to respond swiftly and with whatever force necessary to threats against the peace {{in any part of}} the world, reinforcing unified commands or... carrying out separate contingency operations." [...] McNamara also increased long-range airlift and sealift capabilities and funds for space research and development. After reviewing the separate and often uncoordinated service efforts in intelligence and communications, McNamara in 1961 consolidated these functions in the Defense Intelligence Agency and the Defense Communications Agency (the latter originally established by Secretary Gates in 1960), having both report to the secretary of defense through the JCS. The <b>end</b> <b>effect</b> was to remove the Intelligence function from the control of the military and to put it {{under the control of the}} Secretary of Defense. In the same year, he set up the Defense Supply Agency to work toward unified supply procurement, distribution, and inventory management under the control of the Secretary of Defense rather than the uniformed military.|$|E

Our study is motivated by the observation that capillary <b>end</b> <b>effects</b> documented in two-phase laboratory-scale experiments can significantly influence permeability estimates. While numerical simulations of two-phase flows in reconstructed pore-spaces are increasingly employed to characterize relative permeabilities, a phenomenon which is akin to capillary <b>end</b> <b>effects</b> can also arise in such analyses due to the constraints applied at {{the boundaries of the}} computational domain. We profile the relative strength of these capillary <b>end</b> <b>effects</b> on the calculation of steady-state relative permeabilities obtained within randomly generated porous micro-structures using a finite volume-based two-phase flow solver.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} considers optimization {{problems in}} which similar decisions {{need to be}} made repeatedly over many successive periods. These problems have wide applications including manpower planning, scheduling, production planning and control, capacity expansion, and equipment replacement/modemization. In reality these decision problems usually extend over an indeterminate horizon, but it is common practice to model them using a finite horizon. Unfortunately, an artificial finite horizon may adversely influence optimal decisions, a difficulty commonly referred to as the <b>end</b> <b>effects</b> problem. Past research into <b>end</b> <b>effects</b> has focused on theoretical issues associated with solving (or approximately solving) infinite-horizon extensions of finite-horizon problems. This dissertation derives equivalent finite-horizon formulations for a small class of infinite-horizon problem structures. For a larger class of problems, it also develops finite-horizon approximations which bound the infinite- horizon optimal solution, thereby quantifying the influence of <b>end</b> <b>effects.</b> For linear programs, extensions of these approximations quantify the <b>end</b> <b>effects</b> of fixed initial period decisions over a functional range of future infinite-horizon conditions.

40|$|This paper proposes the {{theoretical}} framework {{and the consequent}} application of the input-output feedback linearization (FL) control technique to linear induction motors (LIM). LIM, additionally to RIM, presents other strong non-linearities caused by the dynamic <b>end</b> <b>effects,</b> leading to a space-vector dynamic model with time-varying inductance and resistance terms and a braking force term. This paper, starting from a recently developed dynamic model of the LIM taking into consideration its <b>end</b> <b>effects,</b> defines a FL technique suited for LIMs, since it inherently considers its dynamic <b>end</b> <b>effects.</b> The proposed approach has been validated experimentally on a suitably developed test set-up.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} neural based MRAS (Model {{reference}} Adaptive System) speed observer suited for linear induction motors (LIM). Starting from the dynamical equation of the LIM in the {{synchronous reference frame}} in literature, the so-called voltage and current models of the LIM in the stationary reference frame, taking into consideration the <b>end</b> <b>effects,</b> have been deduced. Then, while the inductor equations {{have been used as}} reference model of the MRAS observer, the induced part equations have been discretized and rearranged so to be represented by a linear neural network (ADALINE). On this basis, the so called TLS EXIN neuron has been used to compute on-line, in recursive form, the machine linear speed. As machine under test, a complete dynamic model, based on the constructive elements of the LIM and taking into consideration the <b>end</b> <b>effects</b> by the definition of a proper air-gap function, has been adopted. The proposed MRAS observer has been tested in numerical simulation at high and low linear speeds of the inductor and has been further compared with both the classic MRAS observer taking into consideration the LIM’s <b>end</b> <b>effects</b> and with the MRAS observer based on the RIM’s equations, not considering the <b>end</b> <b>effects...</b>|$|R
