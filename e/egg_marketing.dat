5|$|In 1893, Esbjerg {{became a}} {{municipality}} {{in its own}} right (initially known as Esbjerg Ladeplads), receiving the status and privileges of a market town in 1899 and incorporating the parish of Jerne (east of the centre) in 1945. A number of institutions and facilities were soon established, including the courthouse and town hall (1891), the gas and waterworks (1896) and the power plant (1907). From the beginning of the 20th century, Esbjerg prospered not only as a fishing port but became one of the country's major export centres. Established in 1895 by nine local dairies, the butter-packaging factory, Dansk Andels Smørpakkeri, employed some 150 workers until 1920, packing and dispatching butter for the London market. It was later extended to include <b>egg</b> <b>marketing</b> under the name Dansk Andels Ægeksport. Ultimately, it handled produce from 140 dairies spread across the whole of Jutland. After the Second World War, the town developed several agricultural industries, especially meat processing and packaging with a plant employing over 300. The slaughterhouse and meat packaging facility, Esbjerg Andels-Slagteri, established in 1887, became Denmark's sixth largest by 1962. It later became part of Vestjyske Slagterier in 1986, and in 2001, it was acquired by Danish Crown.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the liquor controversy growing in the province, there was another testing of citizens' sentiment on an issue. The government decided to hold a plebiscite among egg producers {{on whether or not}} to establish a compulsory <b>egg</b> <b>marketing</b> board. That plebiscite was originally to be held in June 1957, but Leonard Halmrast, the Minister of Agriculture, decided to hold it in conjunction with the liquor plebiscite so that the sentiment of Egg producers could be tested {{at the same time as}} voters for the liquor plebiscite, to save costs. That decision later led to controversy when numerous producers were missed after the plan was defeated in a close vote.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In the {{environment}} of supply chain, the market price of the poultry and eggs is greatly affects by different chains which increase the forecasting complexity. This paper focuses on the poultry and <b>eggs</b> <b>market</b> price forecasting methods {{in order to increase}} the predication accuracy. A market price forecasting expert system for the poultry and eggs based on neural network is proposed in this paper to build the market data system of the poultry and eggs in the supply chain. According to the neural network estimation model based on the data, the poultry and <b>eggs</b> <b>market</b> price can be accurately predicted. The experiment illustrates the improved algorithm can predicate the poultry and <b>eggs</b> <b>market</b> price in the supply chain, which can increase the accuracy and meet the practical demands in poultry and <b>eggs</b> <b>market.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of <b>egg</b> <b>market</b> {{has been studied}} through measurement of oneness in the <b>egg</b> <b>markets.</b> For this purpose, the Engle-Granger Cointegration test procedure {{has been applied to}} egg price series for major wholesale <b>egg</b> <b>markets</b> in the country, viz.

The study has indicated that the six major wholesale <b>egg</b> <b>markets</b> in the country are cointegrated apparently due to {{performance of}} market intelligence functions by the National Egg Coordination Committee (NECC) which helps in transmitting price signals across the length and breadth of the country through print media on day-to-day basis.

However, it still remains to be examined whether the poultry farmers and traders at the grass-root level are able to realize the prices declared by the NECC. Agribusiness, Marketing,...|$|R
2500|$|Dissenting in Canadian <b>Egg</b> <b>Marketing</b> Agency v.

2500|$|Coincidentally, the {{transmission}} of the series clashed {{in the early months}} of 1963 with the second series of Steptoe and Son, written by Hancock's former writers, Galton and Simpson. Critical comparisons did not favour Hancock's series. Around 1965, Hancock made a series of 11 TV adverts for the <b>Egg</b> <b>Marketing</b> Board. Hancock starred in the adverts with Patricia Hayes as the character [...] "Mrs Cravatte" [...] in an attempt to revive the Galton and Simpson style of scripts. Slightly earlier, in 1963, he had featured in a spoof Hancock Report – hired by Lord Beeching to promote his plan to reduce railway mileage in advertisements.

[...] Section 6 also grants Canadians economic rights, but only insofar as one has equal rights to pursue work. The safeguards against discrimination in subsection 6(3) shows mobility rights are [...] "largely predicated {{on the right to}} equal treatment."

With the transition of China's agricultural products market from the planned circulation system to the free flow circulation under the national macro-control, the cyclical fluctuations of <b>eggs</b> <b>market</b> price were increasingly frequent. The healthy development of China's eggs industry was related to how to filter the variable factors and establish econometric models that could realize timely and dynamic monitoring on short-term fluctuations of <b>eggs</b> <b>market</b> price, which also provided real-time market information and trends for farmers, enhancing their ability against market risk and increasing their income.

Recent statistics regarding the <b>egg</b> <b>market</b> in France suggest that retailer brands largely adopt common labels. A simple theoretical framework enables us to determine {{the conditions under which}} producers and/or retailers with different product qualities decide to post a common label on their products. In particular, a situation of multiple equilibria (one where the label is used by the high-quality seller only and one where it is used by the low-quality seller only) is exhibited when the cost of the label is relatively large. The demand is then estimated for different segments of the French <b>egg</b> <b>market,</b> including producer/retailer brands with/without common labels. The estimates are used to derive expenditure and price elasticities and allow us to calculate welfare measures revealing a relatively large willingness-to-pay for labels. competition, demand estimation, labels, product differentiation. ...|$|R

40|$|We apply {{non-parametric}} {{methods to}} {{a consideration of}} price transmission processes within US <b>egg</b> <b>markets</b> {{at the turn of}} the nineteenth century. Gordon (National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper 7833, 2000) labelled this as an era of 'Great Inventions' which contributed to the subsequent years of significant productivity growth and noted that the development of mechanical refrigeration and transportation technologies played an important role in this growth. Our models present certain advantages relative to parametric models traditionally employed in price transmission analyses. We compare results derived from local polynomial modelling with those obtained using non-linear threshold models. Both techniques suggest that US <b>egg</b> <b>markets</b> were interrelated {{at the turn of the}} nineteenth century. However, non-parametric techniques often suggest a higher degree of price transmission than that implied by threshold models. Results also suggest that threshold models may have difficulties in adequately capturing price relationship dynamics, especially when these are of a highly nonlinear nature.
