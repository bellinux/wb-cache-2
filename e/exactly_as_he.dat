25|$|A new mix {{was created}} for the stereo version of the album, and on 25 February 1963 Martin made one created from {{original}} takes 16, 17 and 18. This stereo version has Lennon fluffing the final verse, causing him to sing 'come on' with a slight chuckle in his voice. Also different in the stereo mix is Harrison's lead guitar line before the final verse; rather than duplicating the overdubbed harmonica <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had earlier in the song, Harrison drops down a fourth for the third note, rather than continuing down by stepwise motion.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, Berkley Books {{published}} The Illustrated Dune, an {{edition of}} Dune with 33 black-and-white sketch drawings and 8 full color paintings by John Schoenherr, {{who had done}} the cover art for the first printing of Dune and had illustrated the Analog serializations of Dune and Children of Dune. Herbert wrote in 1980 that though he had not spoken to Schoenherr prior to the artist creating the paintings, the author {{was surprised to find}} that the artwork appeared <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had imagined its fictional subjects, including sandworms, Baron Harkonnen and the Sardaukar.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} albums from the 1960s and 70s {{featuring}} common stylistic threads made a lifelong impact on Arjen. The dynamic and exciting music, emotionally driven lyrics, and an ensemble cast found in albums such as Andrew Lloyd Webber's Jesus Christ Superstar and The Who's Tommy, {{commonly referred to}} as rock operas, inspired Arjen to create one of his own. Working in an environment where he could develop an album <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> wanted, Arjen intended to create his vision, making no compromises along the way. His vision manifested itself in The Final Experiment and, after being rejected by several different record labels, was picked up by a small Dutch record label. The project was financially burdensome, but through some subsidization from his father, it was seen through to completion, and was successful enough to warrant another Ayreon release.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{original}} ballet {{is only about}} 85 minutes long if performed without applause or an intermission, and therefore much shorter than either Swan Lake or The Sleeping Beauty, some modern staged performances have omitted or re-ordered some of the music, or inserted selections from elsewhere, thus adding to the confusion over the suites. In fact, most of the very famous versions of the ballet have had {{the order of the}} dances slightly re-arranged, if they have not actually altered the music. For instance, the 1954 George Balanchine New York City Ballet version adds to Tchaikovsky's score an entr'acte that the composer wrote for act 2 of The Sleeping Beauty, but which is now seldom played in productions of that ballet. It is used as a transition between the departure of the guests and the battle with the mice. Nearly all of the CD and LP recordings of the complete ballet present Tchaikovsky's score <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> originally conceived it.|$|E
25|$|Numerous famous {{guests have}} {{stayed at the}} hotel. Claude Monet and James Whistler both stayed at the hotel and painted or drew views, from their rooms, of the River Thames. The Savoy {{featured}} prominently in guest Oscar Wilde's trial for gross indecency. Other celebrity guests in the hotel's early decades included the future King Edward VII, Sarah Bernhardt, Enrico Caruso, Lillie Langtry, H. G. Wells, George Bernard Shaw, Nellie Melba, Charlie Chaplin, Al Jolson, Errol Flynn, Fred Astaire, Marlene Dietrich, Lionel Barrymore, Harry Truman, Audrey Hepburn, Judy Garland, Josephine Baker, Cary Grant, Babe Ruth, Ivor Novello and Noël Coward. The hotel kept records of its guests' preferences, {{so that it could}} provide for them in advance. For Coward, the staff made history by taking the first photographs of a hotel guest's toilet articles so that they could lay them out in his bathroom <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> liked them. They made sure to provide a fireproof eiderdown quilt to Barrymore, as he always smoked while reading in bed.|$|E
500|$|The {{death of}} her eldest son, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, in 1892 was a serious blow to Alexandra. His room and {{possessions}} were kept <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had left them, much as those of Prince Albert were left {{after his death in}} 1861. She said, [...] "I have buried my angel and with him my happiness." [...] Surviving letters between Alexandra and her children indicate that they were mutually devoted. In 1894, her brother-in-law Alexander III of Russia died and her nephew Nicholas II of Russia became Tsar. Alexandra's widowed sister, the Dowager Empress, leant heavily on her for support; Alexandra slept, prayed, and stayed beside her sister {{for the next two weeks}} until Alexander's burial.|$|E

500|$|Andrew Davies {{collaborated on}} the screenplays for the 2001 and 2004 Bridget Jones films, in which Crispin Bonham-Carter (Mr. Bingley) and Lucy Robinson (Mrs. Hurst) {{appeared}} in minor roles. The self-referential in-joke between the projects convinced Colin Firth {{to accept the}} role of Mark Darcy, as it gave him an opportunity to ridicule and liberate himself from his Pride and Prejudice character. Film critic James Berardinelli would later state that Firth [...] "plays this part [...] <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> played the earlier role, making it evident that the two Darcys are essentially the same". The producers never {{found a way to}} incorporate the Jones-Firth interview in the second film but shot a spoof interview with Firth as himself and Renée Zellweger staying in character as Bridget Jones after a day's wrap. The scene, which extended Bridget's Darcy obsession to cover Firth's lake scene in Love Actually, is available as a bonus feature on the DVD.|$|E
500|$|Dick became {{concerned}} {{that no one}} had informed him about the film's production, which added to his distrust of Hollywood. After Dick criticized an early version of Fancher's script in an article written for the Los Angeles Select TV Guide, the studio sent Dick the Peoples rewrite. Although Dick died shortly before the film's release, he was pleased with the rewritten script and with a 20-minute special effects test reel that was screened for him when he was invited to the studio. Despite his well-known skepticism of Hollywood in principle, Dick enthused to Scott that the world created for the film looked <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had imagined it. He said, [...] "I saw a segment of Douglas Trumbull's special effects for Blade Runner on the KNBC-TV news. I recognized it immediately. It was my own interior world. They caught it perfectly." [...] He also approved of the film's script, saying, [...] "After I finished reading the screenplay, I got the novel out and looked through it. The two reinforce each other, so that someone who started with the novel would enjoy the movie and someone who started with the movie would enjoy the novel." [...] The motion picture was dedicated to Dick. Principal photography of Blade Runner began on March 9, 1981, and ended four months later.|$|E

500|$|As cricket {{correspondent}} for the Yorkshire Post, Kilburn wrote primarily about Yorkshire County Cricket Club. His obituary in Wisden Cricketers' Almanack described his writing style: he wrote [...] "with a fountain pen on press telegram forms at 60 or 80 words a shilling. At the close of play he immediately concluded his essay; he hardly ever crossed anything out. His cricketing judgments were assured and rigorous, his style exact but sometimes elegant: Leyland's bowling is a joke {{but it is an}} extremely practical joke." [...] The Times stated that his reports were [...] "always precise, frequently elegant, sometimes stern and invariably fair and accurate. He never wrote an unpolished piece or an unidentifiable one, although he was only occasionally analytical." [...] The speed and ease with which he produced his reports, and his refusal to use a typewriter—which he described as [...] "the devil's own invention"—were envied by other journalists. Kilburn's writing was printed <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> wrote it; sub-editors did not touch anything, even if he had made a mistake, as his employers valued his style so greatly. He refused to write about off-field events which caused consternation for his editors as Yorkshire cricket was turbulent behind the scenes at the time he wrote. Nor would he write about the wider aspects of cricket, confident that his reputation made it impossible to sack him. This attitude made him popular with the players, and he became particularly close to Len Hutton and Donald Bradman. His position at the Yorkshire Post gave him freedom to write about whatever he chose, and he refused several offers to move to national newspapers. But his obituary in The Times suggested that, had he worked for a London publication, he would have been as well-known and respected as Cardus, E. W. Swanton and R. C. Robertson-Glasgow.|$|E
500|$|The {{return of}} a wife after 18years results in Michael Henchard's {{downfall}} in Thomas Hardy's novel Mayor of Casterbridge (1886). [...] A bad-tempered, impulsive and cruel husband, feeling burdened by his wife, Henchard sells her to a stranger for five guineas. [...] He becomes a successful businessman and rises {{to the position of}} mayor, but the return of his wife many years later prompts his fall back into penury. [...] The custom was also referred to in the 19th-century French play, Le Marché de Londres. Commenting on the drama and contemporary French attitudes on the custom, in 1846 the writer Angus B. Reach complained: [...] "They reckon up a long and visionary list of our failings [...] would as readily give up their belief in the geographical and physical existence of London, as in the astounding fact that in England a husband sells his wife <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> sells his horse or his dog." [...] Such complaints were still commonplace nearly 20years later; in The Book of Days (1864), author Robert Chambers wrote about a case of wife selling in 1832, and noted that [...] "the occasional instances of wife-sale, while remarked by ourselves with little beyond a passing smile, have made a deep impression on our continental neighbours, [...] constantly cite it as an evidence of our low civilisation." [...] Embarrassed by the practice, a legal handbook of 1853 enabled English judges to dismiss wife selling as a myth: [...] "It is a vulgar error that a husband can get rid of his wife by selling her in the open market with a halter round her neck. Such an act on his part would be severely punished by the local magistrate." [...] Originally published in 1869, Burn's Justice of the Peace and Parish Officer states that [...] "publicly selling or buying a wife is clearly an indictable offence... And many prosecutions against husbands for selling, and others for buying, have recently been sustained, and imprisonment for six months inflicted".|$|E

2500|$|Swinden's large– – {{untitled}} abstract mural {{has been}} described as a [...] "carefully balanced, disciplined composition of rectangular shapes punctuated by occasional biomorphic forms". He was not able to execute the mural <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> had originally conceptualized, due to constraints of the installation space; for example, the unpainted upper corners which were inserted during restoration are where structural beams were present at the Williamsburg site. The black strip at the top and the broken blue one on the right were probably also changes made due to requirements of using the particular space.|$|E
2500|$|Repin's contemporaries often {{commented on}} his special ability of {{capturing}} peasant {{life in his}} works.

I know many artists who have painted peasants, some of them very well, {{but none of them}} ever came close to what Repin does." [...] Leo Tolstoy later stated that Repin [...] "depicts the life of the people much better than any other Russian artist." [...] He was praised for his ability to reproduce human life with powerful and vivid force.|$|E

2500|$|In 1926 Wittgenstein {{was again}} {{working as a}} {{gardener}} {{for a number of}} months, this time at the monastery of Hütteldorf, where he had also inquired about becoming a monk. His sister, Margaret, invited him to help with the design of her new townhouse in Vienna's Kundmanngasse. Wittgenstein, his friend Paul Engelmann, and a team of architects developed a spare modernist house. In particular, Wittgenstein focused on the windows, doors, and radiators, demanding that every detail be <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> specified. When the house was nearly finished Wittgenstein had an entire ceiling raised 30mm so that the room had the exact proportions he wanted. Monk writes that [...] "This is not so marginal as it may at first appear, for it is precisely these details that lend what is otherwise a rather plain, even ugly house its distinctive beauty." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{dimensions}} and key {{system of the}} modern western concert flute and its close relatives are almost completely {{the work of the}} great flautist, composer, acoustician, and silversmith Theobald Boehm, who patented his system in 1847. It was immediately popular, and spread worldwide in just a few years. Minor additions to and variations on his key system are common, but the acoustical structure of the tube remains almost <b>exactly</b> <b>as</b> <b>he</b> designed it. Major innovations were the change to metal instead of wood, large straight tube bore, [...] "parabolic" [...] tapered headjoint bore, very large tone holes covered by keys, and the linked key system, which simplified fingering somewhat. The most substantial departures from Boehm's original description are the universal elimination of the [...] "crutch" [...] for the left hand and almost universal adoption of Briccialdi's thumb key mechanism and a closed-standing G key over an additional G tone hole. Boehm's key system, with minor variations, remains regarded as the most effective system of any modern woodwind, allowing trained instrumentalists to perform with facility and extraordinary velocity and brilliance in all keys.|$|E
