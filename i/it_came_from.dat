5|$|In {{the early}} 1950s an {{anthology}} titled Brief Fantastic Tales appeared from Studio Publications in Toronto; it consisted mostly of reprints from Uncanny Tales, {{and despite the}} difference {{in the name of the}} publisher it is likely <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> the same editor and publishers as Uncanny Tales.|$|E
5|$|Most of the gumfields were in Northland, Coromandel and Auckland, {{the site}} of the {{original}} kauri forests. Initially, the gum was readily accessible, commonly found lying on the ground. Captain Cook reported the presence of resinous lumps on the beach at Mercury Bay, Coromandel, in 1769, although he suspected <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> the mangroves, and missionary Samuel Marsden spoke of their presence in Northland in 1819.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} etymologies {{suggested}} {{for the name}} [...] "Odra". One is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the Croatian word [...] "oderati" [...] (to cut through). The other is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the Indo-European root *wodr (water).|$|R
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{suggested}} etymologies {{for the name}} [...] "Karašica". It's not explainable in Croatian. One is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the Turkish words [...] "kara su" [...] (black stream). Second is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the Latin word [...] "Carassius", denoting several species of freshwater fish. Perhaps the most likely one is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the Indo-European root *(s)ker, meaning [...] "to cut", in the sense [...] "the river that cuts through the valley".|$|R
5|$|The exact {{degree of}} Caroline's wealth was always {{problematic}} to trace, as {{the king had}} placed {{so much of it}} in different sources often difficult to locate and measure both during his lifetime and after his death. One 1912 source for instance reported that out of the king's estimated estate of $65,000,000, Caroline received $7,000,000, while others stressed still higher numbers, and that the majority of <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> Congo shares.|$|E
5|$|Theories {{as to the}} {{derivation}} of the Peak District name {{include the}} idea that <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> the Pecsaetan or peaklanders, an Anglo-Saxon tribe who inhabited the central and northern parts of the area from the 6th century AD when it fell within the large Anglian kingdom of Mercia.|$|E
5|$|Around 52 {{minutes and}} 47 seconds into the film, when Shatner {{is talking about}} the other Original Series actors disliking him, he shifts in his chair and a sound evocative of {{flatulence}} is audible. This sound, apparently unnoticed by the filmmakers, was first mentioned in the media by Adam Buckman in the New York Post on October 10, 2001. Buckman wrote that he played the sound for more than six colleagues who all agreed that <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> Shatner. This scene became a popular subject of flatulence humor among Star Trek fans and on morning zoo radio programs. Reviewers identified as many as six other similar noises in Mind Meld, between the 52-minute mark and the end.|$|E
5000|$|In Hungarian {{the town}} is known as Valpó and in German as Walpach. In antiquity, it was called Iovalum. [...] There are several {{suggested}} etymologies. One is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the Latin root *Iov-, meaning [...] "divine". However, the ending can't be explained by Latin. One explanation is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the Indo-European words *yow and *h2elut, so that it means [...] "magical beer." [...] The other, more likely, is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the Indo-European roots *yow and *h2elom, so that it means [...] "magical herb", whatever plant that signified. Perhaps the simplest explanation is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the Indo-European word *wel, meaning [...] "valley", whatever [...] "Io-" [...] meant.|$|R
25|$|The {{origin of}} the name is not clearly or {{certainly}} known. Some guess <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the kelts who lived before the Germans <b>came.</b> Others guess <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> old high German from daha, which means clay, and ouwe (water overflown land).|$|R

[...] "I am a traitress in your eyes because I have received a communication from Germany. <b>From</b> whom does <b>it</b> <b>come,</b> do you think? From the Court? From the Chancellor {{or one of his}} myrmidons? Fool! <b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> those who hate the whole military party. <b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the Germany whose people have been befooled and strangled throughout the war. <b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the people whom your politicians have sought to reach and failed." ...|$|R
5|$|Because {{strontium}} is {{so similar}} to calcium, it {{is incorporated in}} the bone. All four stable isotopes are incorporated, in roughly the same proportions they are found in nature. However, the actual distribution of the isotopes tends to vary greatly from one geographical location to another. Thus, analyzing the bone of an individual can help determine the region <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>from.</b> This approach helps to identify the ancient migration patterns and the origin of commingled human remains in battlefield burial sites.|$|E
5|$|Severe acute {{respiratory}} syndrome (SARS) {{is caused}} by a new type of coronavirus. Other coronaviruses were known to cause mild infections in humans, so the virulence and rapid spread of this novel virus strain caused alarm among health professionals as well as public fear. The fears of a major pandemic were not realised, and by July 2003, after causing around 8,000 cases and 800 deaths, the outbreak had ended. The exact origin of the SARS virus is not known, but evidence suggests that <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> bats.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} commercially successful, but it {{received}} largely negative reviews, although even critical reviews complimented Baker's makeup effects. According to writer/director Sachs, many scenes that were re-shot and {{changed by the}} producers proved problematic due to their inferior acting. The Incredible Melting Man was featured in the comedy <b>It</b> <b>Came</b> <b>from</b> Hollywood (1982) and inspired the makeup effects for a scene in the science fiction-action film RoboCop (1987). It was also featured in a season 7 episode of the comedy television series Mystery Science Theater 3000.|$|E
5000|$|Psunj {{was called}} [...] "Pisunus" [...] in antiquity. There are several {{suggested}} etymologies for that. One is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the Indo-European root *pekj (cattle). The other is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the Indo-European roots *peiH (big, {{in the sense}} [...] "mountain") and *sen (old). One {{very similar to that}} is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> *peiH and *sewn (black). The other is that it's related to the Latin word [...] "pinus", meaning [...] "pine tree" [...] or [...] "resin", itself without a widely accepted etymology.|$|R

2500|$|Uncertain etymology, most {{probably}} from Arabic [...] (...) [...] Some claim <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> [...] ( [...] , [...] "right-hand side" [...] {{in the sense}} of [...] "south"). Others that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the form [...] ( [...] , [...] "happiness") and is related to the region's classical name Arabia Felix.|$|R
5|$|The most {{significantly}} affected area was Veracruz, where damage reached over $1billion pesos ($92million 2007USD). Most of <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> road {{damage in the}} state's northern portion, although there were also hundreds of damaged houses. Between Veracruz and neighboring Hidalgo, there were 123,320people affected across 112municipalities. Overall there were six deaths in the country, one in Veracruz and five in Puebla. In the latter state, {{a family of three}} perished in a landslide.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of Acrocanthosaurus in the Cloverly Formation {{was established in}} 2012 with the description of another partial skeleton, UM20796. This specimen, consisting of parts of two vertebrae, partial pubic bones, a femur, a partial fibula, and fragments, represents a juvenile animal. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> a bonebed in the Bighorn Basin of north-central Wyoming, and was found near the shoulder blade of a Sauroposeidon. An assortment of other fragmentary theropod remains from the formation may also belong to Acrocanthosaurus, {{which may be the}} only large theropod in the Cloverly Formation.|$|E
5|$|The west door, {{actually}} in {{the south side of}} the church, is an elegant ornamented Decorated Gothic pointed arch, traditionally said to have come from Strata Florida Abbey. Whether it actually came from the Abbey is uncertain. A more probable date is thirteenth century, given its syle. Strata Florida Abbey was founded in 1164 and was consecrated in 1201. The arch is exceptionally ornate, indeed the finest such work in the county. It has three deeply moulded shafts each triple-roll with keel to centre roll and stiff-leaf capitals and matching triple mouldings to the pointed arch, with hoodmould. There is no evidence, archaeological or documentary, that <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> Strata Florida, or indeed anywhere else.|$|E

5000|$|There {{are several}} etymologies {{suggested}} for the hydronym. One is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the Croatian word [...] "oriti", meaning [...] "echo". The other is that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> the Indo-European root *h1or, meaning [...] "to flow". If so, then the same root {{is seen in}} the hydronym [...] "Raša".|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> Agighiol area, in the Tulcea County, Romania.|$|R
5|$|Unfortunately, its {{original}} provenance remains unknown. The relief was not archaeologically excavated, and thus {{we have no}} further information where <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>from,</b> or in which context it was discovered. An interpretation of the relief thus relies on stylistic comparisons with other objects for which the date and place of origin have been established, on {{an analysis of the}} iconography, and on the interpretation of textual sources from Mesopotamian mythology and religion.|$|E

All DVD releases can be purchased on the Cartoon Network Shop, and the individual episodes can be downloaded from both the iTunes Store and Amazon.com.|$|E
5|$|Witnesses near King at {{the moment}} of his death said that the shot came from another location. They said that <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> behind thick {{shrubbery}} near the boarding house—which had been cut away in the days following the assassination—and not from the boarding house window. However, Ray's fingerprints were found on various objects (a rifle, a pair of binoculars, articles of clothing, a newspaper) that were left in the bathroom where it was determined the gunfire came from. An examination of the rifle containing Ray's fingerprints also determined that at least one shot was fired from the firearm {{at the time of the}} assassination.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} {{hypothetical}} {{explanations for the}} origins of the name Siemianowice: either <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> seven huts which were called Siedminowice/Siedmionowice in Old Polish; from the old legend about Siemion (Siemian), Michał and Maciej, or Siemion, Michał and Jakub; or <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> ziemia nawa which means earth taken away from water.|$|R
50|$|In reality, <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> Persian xoş (sweet) + maram (kaymak).|$|R
5|$|From 20 to 24 February, Gočeva held five concerts at the Macedonian Opera and Ballet (MOB) {{during which}} she {{performed}} songs from Makedonsko Devojče 2 live for the first time. The concertgoers {{were the first to}} receive copies of the album along with their tickets which were put on sale on 9 December 2013. In 2014, 15,000 tickets were sold for Gočeva's concerts in Skopje. In January 2014, a listening party for the album was held at the club XO in Skopje on which Gočeva was also present; the event represented the first of such kind in Macedonia and according to Gočeva, the inspiration for <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> a similar trend popular across the world where the artist and the team working behind the album listen to the full final version of the project together with a group of fans and music journalists.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan Gems, who had {{previously}} written multiple unproduced screenplays for director Tim Burton, came up with his own idea for a Mars Attacks film in 1993. The writer pitched both concepts of Mars Attacks and Dinosaurs Attack! to Burton, who both decided that Dinosaurs Attack! would be too similar to Jurassic Park (1993). Burton, who was busy preparing Ed Wood (1994), believed that Mars Attacks! would be a perfect opportunity {{to pay homage to}} the films of Edward D. Wood, Jr., especially Plan 9 from Outer Space (1959), and other 1950s science fiction B movies, such as Invaders from Mars (1953), <b>It</b> <b>Came</b> <b>from</b> Outer Space (1953), The War of the Worlds (1953), Target Earth (1954), Invasion of the Body Snatchers (1956) and Earth vs. the Flying Saucers (1956).|$|E
5|$|The arm-tefillin is laid on {{the inner}} side of the bare left arm, right arm if one is left handed, two finger breadths above the elbow, so that when the arm is bent the tefillin faces towards the heart. The arm-tefillin is {{tightened}} with the thumb, the blessing is said, and the strap is immediately wrapped around the upper arm in the opposite direction <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>from</b> {{in order to keep the}} knot tight without having to hold it. Some wrap it around the upper arm for less than a full revolution (the bare minimum to keep the knot tight) and then wrap it around the forearm seven times, while others wrap it around the upper arm an additional time before wrapping it around the forearm. Many Ashkenazim wear the knot to be tightened (not to be confused with the knot on the base which is permanently tied and always worn on the inside, facing the heart) on the inside and wrap inward, while Nusach Sephard Ashkenazim and all Sephardim wear it on the outside and wrap outward.|$|E
