40|$|Ideles and adeles can {{be viewed}} as a {{generalization}} of Minkowski theory, in which embedding of a number field to the Cartesian product of <b>its</b> <b>completions</b> at the archimedean valuation is generalized to an embedding of the Cartesian product of all <b>its</b> <b>completions</b> with some restriction. This paper introduces the basic notions of point-set topology and builds the real numbers from the rational numbers. Then we review concepts from local fields that will lead to the product formula and the approximation theorem. We, then, construct adeles and ideles. The ideles modulo $k^*$ maps surjectively to the ideal class group, and the compactness of $C_S^ 0 $ will give rise to an alternative proof to the Dirichlet's S-unit theorem and the finiteness of ideal class group. The paper assumes that the reader is familiar with Dedekind domain, principal ideal domain, unique factorization of Dedekind domain, and field norm and traces. The first few parts of Chapter 1 in Neukirch's Algebraic Number Theory will be sufficient for the paper...|$|R
