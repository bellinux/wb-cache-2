5|$|On 26 May 2015 it was {{announced}} that Dutton would relinquish the post early. Dutton resigned effectively on 28 September 2015, concluding his civilian career working with the British Foreign Office. Dutton cited that his resignation was due to his <b>frustration</b> <b>over</b> the British Government's lack of action towards the Spanish aggression in Gibraltar's sovereign waters, his disenchantment with the largely ceremonial office of Governor (later denied) and his personal inability to act on these events.|$|E
5|$|When {{the region}} of Biafra broke away from Nigeria in 1967, Achebe became a {{supporter}} of Biafran independence and acted as ambassador {{for the people of}} the new nation. The war ravaged the populace, and as starvation and violence took its toll, he appealed to the people of Europe and the Americas for aid. When the Nigerian government retook the region in 1970, he involved himself in political parties but soon resigned due to <b>frustration</b> <b>over</b> the corruption and elitism he witnessed. He lived in the United States for several years in the 1970s, and returned to the U.S. in 1990, after a car accident left him partially disabled.|$|E
5|$|Although {{enjoyment}} {{factored into}} Culverhouse's {{purchase of the}} Buccaneers, it was {{first and foremost a}} business decision which he expected to be profitable. He admitted to being known for his frugality, due to moves such as wearing outdated clothing, and having the One Buc Place walls painted white to avoid having to spend money on projection screens. This was not initially a problem for the franchise, even though the budget airplane that Culverhouse chartered for the team almost crashed after their very first game; original coach John McKay reported in 1978 that Culverhouse had never blocked any deals, even those involving a great amount of money. Later, however, the team let go or traded away many of its players who were highly paid and/or demanded more money, including Dave Pear, Doug Williams, Ricky Reynolds, Reggie Cobb, Mark Carrier, and Jeris White. First-round draft choices were frequently traded for players who were not considered to be of equal value, as when the team traded for often-injured defensive end Wally Chambers without requiring that he first pass a physical examination. <b>Frustration</b> <b>over</b> being beaten by players he had pleaded with Culverhouse to sign contributed to the resignation of McKay. He also fired well-regarded personnel director Ken Herock, when Herock demanded to be paid in line with his value around the league.|$|E

25|$|Collins' tenure saw {{the club}} sell {{more of their}} star players, {{including}} Kevin Thomson, Scott Brown, Ivan Sproule and Steven Whittaker, mostly to the Old Firm. The benefit of these sales is that the club's financial position has been improved significantly and the club has also been able {{to invest in a}} training ground. Hibs have kept a tight control of player wages, however, and Collins blamed <b>frustration</b> <b>over</b> the lack of funds available to replace the players who were sold as his reason for resigning.|$|E

25|$|Wilder did {{not keep}} copies of her {{correspondence}} with Lane, but Lane kept carbon copies of virtually everything she ever wrote, including the correspondence with her mother concerning the Little House books. The correspondence shows that Wilder sometimes adamantly refused to accept some of Lane's suggestions, {{and at other times}} gratefully accepted them. Lane's diaries show reactions to time spent on the project ranging from anger and <b>frustration</b> <b>over</b> financial loss from lack of her own work to elation at the success of the books and the prestige and income they brought to Wilder.|$|E
25|$|There {{is general}} <b>frustration</b> <b>over</b> {{the failure to}} achieve a more rapid {{improvement}} in standards of living. The United States, because of its identification with {{the failure of the}} Alliance for Progress to live up to expectations, is blamed. People in the countries concerned also used our visit as an opportunity to demonstrate their frustrations with the failure of their own governments to meet their needs...demonstrations that began over grievances were taken over and exacerbated by anti-US and subversive elements which sought to weaken the United States, and their own governments in the process.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{externally}} visible components, such as X window managers, a non-obvious {{but quite}} central role {{is played by}} the programs hosted by freedesktop.org, such as D-Bus or PulseAudio; both major desktop environments (GNOME and KDE) include them, each offering graphical front-ends written using the corresponding toolkit (GTK+ or Qt). A display server is another component, which {{for the longest time}} has been communicating in the X11 display server protocol with its clients; prominent software talking X11 includes the X.Org Server and Xlib. <b>Frustration</b> <b>over</b> the cumbersome X11 core protocol, and especially over its numerous extensions, has {{led to the creation of}} a new display server protocol, Wayland.|$|E

25|$|Construction of the Star of Oregon {{began in}} the autumn of 1840 with Felix Hathaway supervising, and John Canan, Ralph Kilbourne, Pleasant Armstrong, Henry Woods, Josiah Lamberson Parrish, George Davis, and Jacob Green {{providing}} less skilled labor. The crew began construction of the schooner {{on the east side of}} Swan Island (part of today's Portland, Oregon). In the spring of 1841, the project was jeopardized when Hathaway quit because of the group's inability to pay him, the advent of other more promising business opportunities, and his <b>frustration</b> <b>over</b> the lack of needed building materials. At the time of Hathaway's resignation, the keel of the schooner had been finished to just above the water line.|$|E
25|$|With a {{sensitive}} change of leadership approaching in 2012 and popular uprisings against authoritarian regimes occurring across the Middle East, the ruling Chinese Communist Party {{showed no signs}} of loosening its grip on power in 2011. Despite minor legal improvements regarding the death penalty and urban property confiscation, the government stalled or even reversed previous reforms related to the rule of law, while security forces resorted to extralegal forms of repression. Growing public <b>frustration</b> <b>over</b> corruption and injustice fueled tens of thousands of protests and several large outbursts of online criticism during the year. The party responded by committing more resources to internal security forces and intelligence agencies, engaging in the systematic enforced disappearance of dozens of human rights lawyers and bloggers, and enhancing controls over online social media.|$|E
25|$|Peter Wright, {{a former}} senior MI5 officer {{involved}} in the internal investigation, had been a major confidential source for Pincher's early 1980s work; that situation was only explained years later. In 1987, Wright, who had retired from MI5 in 1976 amid <b>frustration</b> <b>over</b> his very small pension after more than 20 years of service, published his book, Spycatcher, in which he repeated the claims against Hollis and gave considerable details about the investigations into both Hollis and Mitchell. The book {{was first published in}} Australia, Wright had retired there, and the British government made strenuous legal efforts there to suppress the book's publication, but failed; their grounds centred around Wright's betrayal of British secrets having agreed to confidentiality arrangements while he was a serving MI5 officer. Wright's suspicions had originally centred on Mitchell, but eventually the evidence against Hollis appeared much stronger.|$|E

25|$|Members of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee {{traveled}} to Ukraine and Poland in 2016 and learned about Russian operations to influence their elections. Senator Angus King said the problem frustrated both political parties. On November 30, 2016, seven {{members of the}} committee asked President Obama to declassify and publicize more information on Russia's role in the U.S. election. Representatives in the U.S. Congress took action to monitor the national security of the United States by advancing legislation to monitor propaganda. On November 30, 2016, legislators approved a measure within the National Defense Authorization Act to ask the U.S. State Department to act against propaganda with an inter-agency panel. The initiative was developed through a bipartisan bill, the Countering Foreign Propaganda and Disinformation Act, written by U.S. Senators Republican Rob Portman and Democrat Chris Murphy. Senate Intelligence Committee member Ron Wyden said <b>frustration</b> <b>over</b> covert Russian propaganda was bipartisan.|$|E
25|$|While {{corporations}} {{state that}} mining operations will provide greater employment {{opportunities for the}} local population, many of their employees come from outside of the immediate area. In many cases, the employees are drawn from outside of the region in which the mining operations take place or outside of the country. This is because the mineral corporations require individuals with advanced skills to fill their positions. Thus, while Peru's mineral industry allows for greater employment at the national level, it often generates corporate-community conflict on a local scale. According to the Journal of Latin American Geography, members of rural communities often report {{that there is a}} lack of employment opportunities available at the mining sites and vocalize their <b>frustration</b> <b>over</b> the fact that a large proportion of the mine's employees come from outside of the local area. Despite such frustrations, mining corporations do offer some employment to individuals from surrounding rural communities. According to the World Development Journal, this has produced community-level tensions due to growing inequalities within the middle and upper-middle classes.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to state <b>frustration</b> <b>over</b> the workload in preparing these reports, the HRC in July 2010 proposed a new optional reporting procedure called the ‘List of Issues Prior to Reporting’ (LOIPR). The LOIPR system implements a new procedure whereby the committee sends the state {{a list of}} issues to address and the resulting report satisfies the requirements of Article 40 of the ICCPR. This system remains in the pilot stage until 2015 where the procedure will be reviewed “in terms of its practicality, effectiveness and capacity to improve {{the examination of the}} human rights situation in the State parties”. It is intended LOIPR will allow for time to be used more efficiently and provide focus to the report. A further advantage of the procedure will be that a state will not have to submit both a periodic report and LOIPR report (though initial reports will be required). LOIPR remains an optional report and states may elect to continue with the periodic reports system or may be required by the committee to prepare a full report.|$|E

25|$|Seeking to {{capitalise}} on the Greens' {{success in the}} EP elections, a group named Green 2000 was established in July 1990, arguing for an internal reorganisation of the party {{in order to develop}} it into an effective electoral force capable of securing seats in the House of Commons. Its proposed reforms included a more centralised structure, the replacement of the existing party council with a smaller party executive, and the establishment of delegate voting at party conferences. Many party members opposed the reforms, believing that they would undermine the internal party democracy, and amid the arguments various key members resigned or were dismissed from the Greens. Although Green 2000 proposals were defeated at the party's 1990 conference, they were overwhelmingly carried at their 1991 conference, resulting in an internal restructuring of the party. Between the end of 1990 and mid-1992, the party lost over half its members, with those polled indicating that <b>frustration</b> <b>over</b> a lack of clear and effective party leadership was a major reason in their decision. The party fielded more candidates than it had ever done before in the 1992 general election but was widely deemed to have performed poorly.|$|E
25|$|The Lakers {{improved}} their record to 17–1 since the All-Star break before losing five straight games, putting {{them out of}} reach from {{the best record in}} the Western Conference. The losing streak ended with a 102–93 home win over the Spurs, who sat out Tim Duncan, Tony Parker and Manu Ginóbili. However, Bynum sustained a hyperextended right knee when he landed on DeJuan Blair's foot in the game. He missed the remaining games of the season with a bruised knee, but returned for the playoffs. Blake was diagnosed with chickenpox and missed the rest of the season. During the Spurs' game, Bryant used a derogatory gay term in <b>frustration</b> <b>over</b> a referee's call and was later fined $100,000 by the NBA. The Lakers and Bryant later apologized for the use of the word while Bryant appealed the fine. The Lakers produced a public service announcement with Bryant and other Lakers denouncing Bryant's behavior. In the last game of the regular season, the Lakers secured the No. 2 seed in the Western Conference of the 2011 playoffs with a 116–108 overtime win over the Kings in possibly their last game in Sacramento. The Lakers surrendered a 20-point lead in the fourth quarter, but Bryant made a tying 3-pointer with 4.8 seconds remaining to send the game into overtime.|$|E
