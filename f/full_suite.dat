5|$|The Northrop F-20 Tigershark (initially F-5G) was {{a privately}} financed light fighter, {{designed}} and built by Northrop. Its development began in 1975 as a further evolution of Northrop's F-5E Tiger II, featuring a new engine that greatly improved overall performance, and a modern avionics suite including a powerful and flexible radar. Compared with the F-5E, the F-20 was much faster, gained beyond-visual-range air-to-air capability, and had a <b>full</b> <b>suite</b> of air-to-ground modes capable of firing most U.S. weapons. With these improved capabilities, the F-20 became competitive with contemporary fighter designs such as the General Dynamics F-16 Fighting Falcon, but was much less expensive to purchase and operate.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{recorded}} in late 1971, featuring music composed by Anderson and arranged with the contribution of all band members. The live show promoting the album included the playing of the <b>full</b> <b>suite,</b> with various comic interludes. Thick as a Brick is considered by critics {{to be the first}} release by Jethro Tull entirely consisting of progressive rock music. It received mixed reviews upon its release: nonetheless, it was a commercial success and topped various charts in 1972. Today it is regarded as a classic of progressive rock and has received several accolades. Anderson produced a follow-up to the album in 2012, focusing on the adult life of the fictional Gerald Bostock.|$|E

500|$|Unicorn {{was ordered}} on 14 April 1939, and laid down at Harland and Wolff in Belfast, Northern Ireland on 29 June. Her {{construction}} was delayed {{several times in}} favour of higher priority projects {{and she was not}} launched until 20 November 1941. The ship was completed on 12 March 1943. In order to accelerate the ship's completion, the Admiralty decided in 1942 that she would not be equipped with her <b>full</b> <b>suite</b> of maintenance and repair equipment. Excluding her armament, Unicorn cost £2,531,000.|$|E
500|$|Dmitrii Donskoi (...) was an {{armoured}} cruiser {{built for}} the Imperial Russian Navy in the early 1880s. She {{was designed as a}} commerce raider and equipped with a <b>full</b> <b>suite</b> of sails to economize on coal consumption. The ship spent the bulk of her career abroad, either in the Far East or in the Mediterranean. Dmitrii Donskoi was assigned to the Second Pacific Squadron after the Japanese destroyed the Russian ships deployed in the Far East during {{the early stages of the}} Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05. The squadron was intercepted by the Japanese fleet in May 1905 in the Battle of Tsushima after a lengthy voyage from the Baltic. The cruiser was not seriously damaged during the initial fighting and tried to continue on to Vladivostok after the first day's fighting. She was spotted by several groups of Japanese warships the following day and was badly damaged in the resulting combat. Her captain ordered the crew ashore off Ulleungdo Island and had Dmitrii Donskoi scuttled offshore.|$|E

500|$|Petr Veliky had its genesis in {{the visit}} of the American twin-turret monitor [...] to Kronstadt in August 1866, that {{inspired}} Rear Admiral A. A. Popov to submit a preliminary design for a low-freeboard, breastwork monitor with a <b>full</b> <b>suite</b> of sails and masts. He intended the ship {{to act as a}} hybrid monitor-cruiser, able to attack enemy shipping and threaten his ports. The design was approved by the Naval Technical Committee (...) , and a detailed design was prepared by September 1867. This was reviewed on 20 February 1868, and the coal supply was ordered to be raised from four to five days' steaming, which forced the design to be revised to accommodate the extra coal. This modified design was approved on 26 January 1869 by the Committee, but more changes were made even after that. In May Popov proposed to add a small superstructure forward of the breastwork to improve seakeeping and overhanging side armor as used on the monitors during the American Civil War. Both changes were approved on 19 June 1869 although the displacement of the ship had constantly increased from the [...] of the 1867 design to the [...] of the June 1869 design.|$|E
500|$|The {{ships of}} the King George V class {{were some of}} the first battleships in the RN to receive the <b>full</b> <b>suite</b> of fire-control {{equipment}} used during the First World War. The control position for the main armament was located in the conning tower. Data from a [...] coincidence rangefinder (an unstabilized Barr and Stroud instrument in [...] and stabilized Argo units in the other ships) {{on the roof of the}} conning tower, together with the target's speed and course information, was input into a Dumaresq mechanical computer and electrically transmitted to a Dreyer Fire-control Table (a Mark III system in King George V and Mark II Tables in the others with an Argo range clock replacing the Dreyer-Elphinstone model in the Mark III) located in the transmitting station located on the main deck. Wind speed and direction was called down to the transmitting station by either voicepipe or sound-powered telephone. The fire-control table integrated all the data and converted it into elevation and deflection data for use by the guns. The target's data was also graphically recorded on a plotting table to assist the gunnery officer in predicting the movement of the target. As a backup, two turrets in each ship could take over if necessary.|$|E

50|$|Matthäus Waissel (c.1540—1602). German lutenist, {{editor of}} music and writer. Waissel was from 1573 {{headmaster}} of a school at Schippenbeil near Königsberg; he published in that year a volume of lute arrangements of vocal pieces, and in 1592 he issued a collection of German dances for lute, which signaled the decline of German lute tablature as it yielded prominence to the so-called French system. Waissel's output comprises three books of solo lute music in all, and one collection of duets. It is unlikely though {{that any of the}} pieces in these collections are his own compositions. Waissel's chief importance arguably lies in his expansion of the passamezzo/saltarello pairing into <b>full</b> <b>suites</b> that in form, if not title, comprise some of the earliest true dance suites.|$|R
