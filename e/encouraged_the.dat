5|$|Charles <b>encouraged</b> <b>the</b> {{production}} of a hymnal (Psalmbok) to be printed and distributed to the churches (completed 1693), and a new printed version of the Bible that was completed in 1703 and named after his successor: Charles XII Bible.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{and other}} {{minerals}} were extracted {{in the west}} of Scotland from medieval times; getting the heavy product to market was always a challenge, and this <b>encouraged</b> <b>the</b> development of tracked systems; the earliest plateways {{in the vicinity of}} Ayr date from—at the latest—1775.|$|E

Solution functions that <b>encourage</b> <b>the</b> grand coalition in convex games always produce allocations in the core, but the converse is not necessarily true...|$|R
30|$|Turkish and Islamic identifications were {{expected}} to relate positively to local voting likelihood in countries with more policies to <b>encourage</b> <b>the</b> political participation of immigrants (MIPEX scores on political participation). Country policies that <b>encourage</b> <b>the</b> political participation of immigrants seem to <b>encourage</b> <b>the</b> mobilization of both Islamic and Turkish identities, but the pattern for Turkish identification is less clear.|$|R

5|$|Starting in 1832, {{abolitionist}} {{and journalist}} William Lloyd Garrison organized anti-slavery associations which <b>encouraged</b> <b>the</b> full participation of women.

5|$|Although Sarah {{implied that}} she had <b>encouraged</b> <b>the</b> escape {{for the safety of}} Princess Anne, {{it is more likely that}} she was {{protecting}} herself and her husband. If James succeeded in defeating Prince William of Orange in battle he might imprison and even execute Lord and Lady Churchill for treason, whereas it was unlikely he would condemn his daughter to a similar fate. But James fled to France in December 1688 rather than confront the invading army, allowing William to take over his throne.|$|E

5|$|As a {{literary}} theorist, Chivers believed in divine inspiration. He <b>encouraged</b> <b>the</b> {{development of a}} distinctive American style of literature and especially promoted young writers. His poems were known for religious overtones {{with an emphasis on}} death and reunions with lost loved ones in the afterlife. Though he built up a mild reputation in his day, he was soon forgotten after his death.|$|E
5|$|At the Detroit council, DePeyster <b>encouraged</b> <b>the</b> Indians {{to unite}} and {{to send a}} force to oppose Clark's expedition. In May 1781, Indian leaders and Indian Department {{officials}} began to gather warriors at the Wyandot town of Upper Sandusky for this purpose. In mid-August, Brant and George Girty, Simon's brother, headed south to the Ohio River with about 90 Iroquois, Shawnee, and Wyandot warriors, {{as well as a}} few white men, while McKee and Simon Girty continued to collect reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Atrocities {{continued}} {{during the}} German retreat from Southern France as German soldiers plundered and burned down towns.

5|$|Bitterness {{between the}} Assyrians and the Arabs was {{reported}} by British historians {{as far back as}} 1920. This was made worse by the British officers of the levies who <b>encouraged</b> <b>the</b> Assyrians to think that they were first-class troops, which had the effect of increasing the natural pride of the Assyrians. This, coupled {{with the fact that the}} British and Assyrian levies succeeded in suppressing Kurdish revolts when the Iraqi Army failed created an inferiority complex among some Iraqi corps towards the British and the Assyrians.|$|E
5|$|By 1910 {{there were}} only a dozen {{fishermen}} in six families living there, and in summer 1912 the island was finally abandoned. Some may have wished to stay, but by now the population had been reduced below a viable number and the lack of a school, which had closed in April 1910, would have been a factor. There is also no doubt that the parish priest, Donald Martin, <b>encouraged</b> <b>the</b> desertion. It is claimed that neither did he like travelling there, nor did the church receive much in the collection box on his visits.|$|E
5|$|By the 1820s, animal {{resources}} were in {{decline in the}} area leading to increased competition among the tribes for game and for furs to sell.
