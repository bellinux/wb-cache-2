The stress-strain behavior of materials is not strictly linear even below the yield point, hence the modulus of elasticity decreases as stress increases, and significantly so as the stresses approach the material's yield strength.

Light gauge cold-formed steel sections {{have been developed}} as more economical building solutions to the alternative heavier hot-rolled sections in the commercial and residential markets. Cold-formed lipped channel beams (LCB), LiteSteel beams (LSB) and hollow flange beams (HFB) are commonly used as flexural members such as floor joists and bearers.

New direct strength method (DSM) based design equations were proposed to determine the ultimate shear capacities of cold-formed steel beams. An improved equation for the higher <b>elastic</b> shear <b>buckling</b> coefficient of cold-formed steel beams was proposed based on finite element analysis results and included in the DSM design equations.

50|$|The Direct Strength Method (DSM) is an {{alternative}} method of design located in Appendix 1 of the North American Specification for the Design of Cold-formed Steel Structural Members 2007 (AISI S100-07). DSM {{may be used in}} lieu of the Main Specification for determining nominal member capacities. Specific advantages include the absence of effective width and iterations, while only using known gross-sectional properties. An increase in prediction confidence stems from forced compatibility between section flanges and web throughout <b>elastic</b> <b>buckling</b> analysis. This increase in prediction accuracy for any section geometry provides a solid basis for rational analysis extension and encourages cross-sectional optimization. Either DSM or the main specification can be used with confidence as the Φ or Ω factors have been designed to insure that both methods are accurate. Currently, DSM only provides solutions for beams and columns and has to be used in conjunction with the main specification for a complete design.|$|E
50|$|There are {{currently}} no provisions within the DSM that pertain to shear, web crippling, holes in members, or strength increases {{due to the}} cold work of forming. Research on several of these topics has been completed or {{is in the process}} of being completed and should be included in the next update of the AISI Specification. DSM is also limited in determining strength for sections in which very slender elements are used. This is due to the strength of a cross section being predicted as a whole with DSM instead of using the effective width method of the specification which breaks the cross section up into several effective elements. One slender element will cause low strength with DSM, which is not the case with the current specification method. The finite strip method using CUFSM is the most commonly used approach to determine the <b>elastic</b> <b>buckling</b> loads. The program also limits DSM because holes cannot be considered, loads have to be uniform along the member, only simply supported boundary conditions are considered, and the buckling modes interact and cannot be easily distinguishable in some cases.|$|E

40|$|In {{the design}} of hot rolled steel structures, {{stability}} {{is one of the}} most important considerations. In terms of flexural members, e. g., a steel I-section beam, bent about the major principal axis, lateral buckling about the minor principal axis in combination with torsional buckling is the main stability concern. To prevent lateral-torsional buckling from occurring, lateral braces are typically installed perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the flexural member, either on the top and/or bottom flange or near the shear-centre of the beam. Nethercot developed an equation to predict the critical elastic lateral-torsional moment resistance of cantilever beams, which involves a series of effective length factors, which are dependent on the brace configuration, type and position of loading, as well as cantilever system. This effective length factor approach has become widely used as a simplified method to calculate the <b>elastic</b> lateral-torsional <b>buckling</b> moment resistance of cantilever steel beams. However, no specific guidelines for {{the design of}} the lateral braces are available in design standards. This thesis will include background information on <b>elastic</b> beam <b>buckling</b> theories, an introduction to the development of research on lateral brace requirements, and a discussion on the currently used lateral bracing requirements in North American and British Standards.

Concerning the required brace stiffness, the results from the numerical parametric study are compared with the results from the Canadian Steel Design Standard CSA-S 16 and the SSRC (Structural Stability Research Council) method of the United States.

40|$|<b>Elastic</b> <b>buckling</b> is {{studied as}} a {{possible}} failure mechanism of a composite. Although it appears that common polymer matrix composites (e. g. glass/epoxy or carbon-graphite/epoxy) undergo plastic micro-buckling or fail due to other mechanisms (such as fibre crushing, delamination, etc.) [Fleck (1997) ], nevertheless, for very dilute composites fabricated in the emerging framework of nanotechnology, <b>elastic</b> <b>buckling</b> may, in fact, be the dominant failure mechanism. The phenomenon of <b>elastic</b> <b>buckling</b> of composites was first investigated in the 1960 ’s. Since then, it has been generally accepted that <b>elastic</b> <b>buckling</b> of a composite consisting of straight fibres in a matrix can occur in two modes: a shear buckling mode (SBM), where the fibre and matrix exhibit in-phase deformation (i. e. assume the same deformed shape and a transverse buckling mode (TBM) where the fibre and matrix exhibit anti-phase deformation Moreover, it is asserted that transverse buckling occurs for relatively low values of the fibre volume fraction, vf, while shear buckling takes place for larger values of vf [Jones (1975) ]. These two types of buckling modes were first studied by Rosen (1964) using, in both cases, simple approximations together with an energy approach. For the case of shear buckling, assuming in-plane buckling, Rosen treated the problem {{by means of a}} model consisting of thin layers embedded in a matrix and thus obtained a buckling stress [see Rose...|$|E

40|$|A {{circular}} arch with in-plane radial loads uniformly distributed around the arch axis is primarily sub-jected to uniform compression. Under this action, the arch may suddenly deflect laterally and twist {{out of the}} plane of loading and fail in a flexural-torsional buckling mode. In most studies of the <b>elastic</b> flexural-torsional <b>buckling</b> of arches under uniform compression, the directions of the uniformly distributed loads are assumed to be unchanged and parallel to their initial directions during buckling. In practice, arches may be subjected to hydrostatic or to uniformly distributed directed radial loads. Hydrostatic loads always remain normal to the tangent of the deformed arch axis, while uniformly distributed directed radial loads always remain directed toward a specific point during buckling. These uniform radial loads may act at a load height, such as at the top surface of the cross-section. In this case, the radial loads produce an additional torsional moment during buckling which affects the flexural-torsional buckling of the arch. This paper uses both virtual work and static equilibrium approaches to study the <b>elastic</b> flexural-torsional <b>buckling,</b> effects of the load height on the buckling of {{circular arch}}es under uniform compression (that is, produced by uniformly distributed dead or by directed radial loads), and closed form solutions for the buckling loads are developed. 1...|$|R

Several analysis techniques are considered (eigenvalue, material nonlinearities, material and geometric nonlinearities), as well as 2 D and 3 D modelling of the structural system. It is determined that the collapse mechanism is a loss-of-stability-induced {{one that can be}} identified by combining a 3 D structural model with an analysis involving both material and geometric nonlinearities. The progressive collapse analysis reveals that after the initial removal of a corner column, its two adjacent columns fail from <b>elastic</b> flexural-torsional <b>buckling</b> at a load lower than the design load. The failure of these two columns is immediately followed by the failure of the next two adjacent columns from <b>elastic</b> flexural–torsional <b>buckling.</b> After the failure of these five columns, the entire structure collapseswithout the occurrence of any significant plastification.
