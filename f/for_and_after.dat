5|$|It {{appears that}} not all {{indigenous}} units were disbanded {{at the end of}} the civil war period (31BC). Some of the more experienced units were kept in existence to complement the legions, and became the core of the standing auxiliary forces that developed in the Julio-Claudian period. During the early rule of Augustus (27BC onwards), the corps of regular Auxilia was created. It was clearly inspired by the Latin forces of the pre-Social War Republic, as a corps of non-citizen troops parallel to the legions. But there were fundamental differences, the same as between Republican and Augustan legions. The Latin forces of the Republic were made up of part-time conscripts in units that would be raised and disbanded <b>for</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> particular campaigns. The Augustan Auxilia were mainly volunteer professionals serving in permanent units.|$|E
25|$|Cyril's famous twenty-three lectures {{given to}} catechumens in Jerusalem being {{prepared}} <b>for,</b> <b>and</b> <b>after,</b> baptism are best considered in two parts: the first eighteen lectures are common {{known as the}} Catechetical Lectures, Catechetical Orations or Catechetical Homilies, while the final five are often called the Mystagogic Catecheses (μυσταγωγικαί), because they deal with the mysteries (μυστήρια) i.e. Sacraments of Baptism, Confirmation and the Eucharist.|$|E

2500|$|White {{made his}} debut {{for the club}} on September 19, 2004, against AEL 1964. [...] He had a shot stopped by the AEL keeper in the 82nd minute, but the ensuing corner kick led to the match's only goal, [...] scored by Kelvin Sebwe, giving Panserraikos a 1-0 win. [...] While with Panserraikos, White was {{frequently}} played out of position as a target forward, as opposed to his preferred withdrawn striker position. Playing as a target forward is extremely unusual for a player who is only 5 feet, 8inches tall. In addition, White claimed that the club physically altered his contract after he signed, attempting to claim that he signed for two years instead of one. [...] White was also forced to play through injury, and eventually suffered a severe concussion that {{kept him out of}} action for two months. [...] Following his recovery, White asked <b>for,</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> a dispute, was granted his release from the club in January 2005.|$|E
2500|$|On May 15, 1970, police {{officers}} in Oxford, NC arrested Alfred Hood and David Washington for possessing [...] "seven sticks of dynamite, two rifles, and a pistol". The two were friends affiliated with James Grant and told authorities later that Grant had told the two to drive up to Charlotte with their supplies. The City Manager of Charlotte, Ragland, remembered Grant as someone who [...] "was an expert in starting fires…he could start a fire in a rainstorm". Hood and Washington were subsequently jailed for possessing such deadly weapons, however after {{a short period of}} time, the two [...] "jumped bail, and fled to Canada" [...] where they were eventually returned on warrants. When the two were apprehended a second time, they decided to cut a deal with the prosecutor that was perceived in the black community as indicative of the social climate of the time period. The men had their general living expenditures paid <b>for,</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> their testimony, would be relocated completely all on the government's dime.|$|E

60|$|There was {{a rush to}} the door, but {{the night}} was a dark one, {{and no one was}} to be seen; then they {{returned}} to the sitting-room, and the little packet was opened, and found to contain some watchworks bent and broken, some pulverized glass, and a battered piece of metal, which, after some trouble, the schoolmaster recognized as the case of his watch. The head-constable was sent <b>for,</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> examining the relics of the case, he came to the same conclusion at which the rest had already arrived, namely, that the watch could not have been stolen by an ordinary footpad, but by some personal enemy of the schoolmaster's, whose object was not plunder, but annoyance and injury.|$|E
60|$|On one occasion, {{after he}} had spent a whole night in {{drinking}} and carousing, the guests, when the usual time arrived for separating, proposed that, instead of this, they should begin anew, and commence a second banquet {{at the end of}} the first. Alexander, half intoxicated already, entered warmly into this proposal. They assembled, accordingly, in a very short time. There were twenty present at this new feast. Alexander, to show how far he was from having exhausted his powers of drinking, began to pledge each one of the company individually. Then he drank to them all together. There was a very large cup, called the bowl of Hercules, which he now called <b>for,</b> <b>and,</b> <b>after</b> having filled it to the brim, he drank it off to the health of one of the company present, a Macedonian named Proteas. This feat being received by the company with great applause, he ordered the great bowl to be filled again, and drank it off as before.|$|E

60|$|When Moses, {{the man of}} God, {{was with}} the {{children}} of Israel in the wilderness, he prays that God would give them his presence unto Canaan, or else to let them die in that place. It was death to him to think {{of being in the}} wilderness without God! And he said unto God, 'If thy presence go not with me, carry us not up hence' (Exo 33:14,15). Here, then, are the desires of a righteous man--namely, after communion with God. He chooses rather to be a stranger with God in the world, than to be a citizen of the world and a stranger to God. 'For I am,' said David, 'a stranger with thee, and a sojourner, as all my fathers were' (Psa 39:12). Indeed, he that walketh with God is but a stranger to this world. And the righteous man's desires are to, <b>for,</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> communion with God, though he be so.|$|E
6000|$|I have {{no doubt}} that both the curious fate and death of his four sons, and the facts (and {{dwelling}} on them) of George Fox's strange early life, and permanent [...] "conversion," [...] {{had much to do with}} the peculiar and sombre ministry and style of E.H. from the first, and confirmed him all through. One must not be dominated by the man's almost absurd saturation in cut and dried biblical phraseology, and in ways, talk, and standard, regardful mainly of the one need he dwelt on, above all the rest. This main need he drove home to the soul; the canting and sermonizing soon exhale away to any auditor that realizes what E.H. is <b>for</b> <b>and</b> <b>after.</b> The present paper, (a broken memorandum of his formation, his earlier life,) is the cross-notch that rude wanderers make in the woods, to remind them afterward of some matter of first-rate importance and full investigation. (Remember too, that E.H. was a thorough believer in the Hebrew Scriptures, in his way.) ...|$|E

The girl had told him of the English {{soldiers}} who had passed, and he knew that they would reach the earl probably before he did. The game was up; all was lost. So he retraced his steps, as a desperate resource, to the last place where he would be looked <b>for,</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> a month of disguising, hiding, and other expedients, found himself again in his native county of Devon, while Fitz-Eustace Viscount Baltinglas had taken ship for Spain, having got little by his famous argument to Ormond in behalf of his joining the Church of Rome, [...] "Had not thine ancestor, blessed Thomas of Canterbury, died for the Church of Rome, thou hadst never been Earl of Ormond." [...] The premises were certainly sounder than those of his party were wont to be; for it was to expiate the murder of that turbulent hero that the Ormond lands had been granted by Henry II.: but as for the conclusion therefrom, it was much {{on a par with the}} rest.|$|E

6000|$|Next came two Dutch prints which Mr. Toller {{had been}} eager <b>for,</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> he had secured them he went away.

It was this marquee that Mr. Bambridge was bent on buying, and he appeared to like looking inside it frequently, as a foretaste of its possession. On the last occasion of his return from it he was observed to bring with him a new companion, a stranger to Mr. Trumbull and every one else, whose appearance, however, led to the supposition that he might be a relative of the horse-dealer's--also [...] "given to indulgence." [...] His large whiskers, imposing swagger, and swing of the leg, made him a striking figure; but his suit of black, rather shabby at the edges, caused the prejudicial inference that {{he was not able to}} afford himself as much indulgence as he liked.|$|E
60|$|My first {{inquiries}} {{were directed}} to the wages of this staff; because, if any establishment claiming to be self-supporting, live upon the spoliation of anybody or anything, or eke out a feeble existence by poor mouths and beggarly resources (as too many so- called Mechanics' Institutions do), I make bold to express my Uncommercial opinion {{that it has no}} business to live, and had better die. It was made clear to me by the account books, that every person employed was properly paid. My next inquiries {{were directed to}} the quality of the provisions purchased, and to the terms on which they were bought. It was made equally clear to me that the quality was the very best, and that all bills were paid weekly. My next inquiries were directed to the balance-sheet for the last two weeks--only the third and fourth of the establishment's career. It was made equally clear to me, that after everything bought was paid <b>for,</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> each week was charged with its full share of wages, rent and taxes, depreciation of plant in use, and interest on capital at the rate of four per cent. per annum, the last week had yielded a profit of (in round numbers) one pound ten; and the previous week a profit of six pounds ten. By this time I felt that I had a healthy appetite for the dinners.|$|E
60|$|When {{the cups}} and cans were duly {{arranged}} upon the table, and when Deborah, whom the ducal generosity honoured with a penny farthing {{in the way}} of gratuity, had withdrawn with her satellites, the worthy potentate, having first slightly invited Lord Glenvarloch to partake of the liquor which he was to pay <b>for,</b> <b>and</b> <b>after</b> having observed, that, excepting three poached eggs, a pint of bastard, and a cup of clary, he was fasting from every thing but sin, set himself seriously to reinforce the radical moisture. Glenvarloch had seen Scottish lairds and Dutch burgomasters at their potations; but their exploits (though each might be termed a thirsty generation) were nothing to those of Duke Hildebrod, who seemed an absolute sandbed, capable of absorbing any given quantity of liquid, without being either vivified or overflowed. He drank off the ale to quench a thirst which, as he said, kept him in a fever from morning to night, and night to morning; tippled off the sack to correct the crudity of the ale; sent the spirits after the sack to keep all quiet, and then declared that, probably, he should not taste liquor till post meridiem, unless it was in compliment to some especial friend. Finally, he intimated that he was ready to proceed on the business which brought him from home so early, a proposition which Nigel readily received, though he could not help suspecting that the most important purpose of Duke Hildebrod's visit was already transacted.|$|E
