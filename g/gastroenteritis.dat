5|$|There are {{a number}} of {{vaccines}} against <b>gastroenteritis</b> in development. For example, vaccines against Shigella and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), two of the leading bacterial causes of <b>gastroenteritis</b> worldwide.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gastroenteritis</b> is {{the main}} reason for 3.7million visits to {{physicians}} a year in the United States and 3million visits in France. In the United States <b>gastroenteritis</b> as a whole is believed to result in costs of 23billion USD per year with that due to rotavirus alone resulting in estimated costs of 1billion USD a year.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, {{rates of}} {{emergency}} department use for noninfectious <b>gastroenteritis</b> dropped 30% from 2006 until 2011. Of the twenty most common conditions {{seen in the}} emergency department, rates of noninfectious <b>gastroenteritis</b> had the largest decrease in visits in that time period.|$|E
5|$|John Lykoudis {{successfully}} treats his own <b>gastroenteritis</b> with antibiotics.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other causes may produce similar {{symptoms}} including appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy, hemorrhagic or ruptured ovarian cysts, ovarian torsion, and endometriosis and <b>gastroenteritis,</b> peritonitis, and bacterial vaginosis among others.|$|E
5|$|A {{supply of}} easily {{accessible}} uncontaminated water and good sanitation practices {{are important for}} reducing rates of infection and clinically significant <b>gastroenteritis.</b> Personal measures (such as hand washing with soap) {{have been found to}} decrease rates of <b>gastroenteritis</b> in both the developing and developed world by as much as 30%. Alcohol-based gels may also be effective. Breastfeeding is important, especially in places with poor hygiene, as is improvement of hygiene generally. Breast milk reduces both the frequency of infections and their duration. Avoiding contaminated food or drink should also be effective.|$|E
5|$|Appendicitis {{may present}} with vomiting, {{abdominal}} pain, {{and a small}} amount of diarrhea in up to 33% of cases. This is in contrast to the large amount of diarrhea that is typical of <b>gastroenteritis.</b> Infections of the lungs or urinary tract in children may also cause vomiting or diarrhea. Classical diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) presents with abdominal pain, nausea, and vomiting, but without diarrhea. One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially diagnosed as having <b>gastroenteritis.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Gastroenteritis</b> is {{typically}} diagnosed clinically, {{based on a}} person's signs and symptoms. Determining the exact cause is usually not needed as it does not alter management of the condition.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, <b>gastroenteritis</b> {{from all}} causes caused 4.6 million deaths in children, with the {{majority}} occurring in the developing world. Death rates were reduced significantly (to approximately 1.5 million deaths annually) by the year 2000, {{largely due to the}} introduction and widespread use of oral rehydration therapy. In the US, infections causing <b>gastroenteritis</b> are the second most common infection (after the common cold), and they result in between 200 and 375million cases of acute diarrhea and approximately ten thousand deaths annually, with 150 to 300 of these deaths in children less than five years of age.|$|E
5|$|Like all livestock, Brumbies {{can carry}} the {{parasite}} Cryptosporidium parvum, which {{can result in}} serious <b>gastroenteritis</b> in people drinking contaminated drinking water.|$|E
5|$|Rotavirus, norovirus, adenovirus, and astrovirus {{are known}} to cause viral <b>gastroenteritis.</b> Rotavirus {{is the most common}} cause of <b>gastroenteritis</b> in children, and {{produces}} similar rates in both the developed and developing world. Viruses cause about 70% of episodes of infectious diarrhea in the pediatric age group. Rotavirus is a less common cause in adults due to acquired immunity. Norovirus is the cause in about 18% of all cases.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gastroenteritis</b> {{is defined}} as {{vomiting}} or diarrhea due to infection of the small or large bowel. The changes in the small bowel are typically noninflammatory, while {{the ones in the}} large bowel are inflammatory. The number of pathogens required to cause an infection varies from as few as one (for Cryptosporidium) to as many as 108 (for Vibrio cholerae).|$|E
5|$|<b>Gastroenteritis</b> is {{strongly}} attenuated by ingestion of zinc, possibly by direct antimicrobial {{action of the}} ions in the gastrointestinal tract, or by the absorption of the zinc and re-release from immune cells (all granulocytes secrete zinc), or both.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gastroenteritis</b> {{is usually}} an acute and {{self-limiting}} disease {{that does not}} require medication. The preferred treatment in those with mild to moderate dehydration is oral rehydration therapy (ORT). For children at risk of dehydration from vomiting, taking a single dose of the anti vomiting medication metoclopramide or ondansetron, may be helpful, and butylscopolamine is useful in treating abdominal pain.|$|E
5|$|In the {{developed}} world Campylobacter jejuni is {{the primary cause of}} bacterial <b>gastroenteritis,</b> with half of these cases associated with exposure to poultry. In children, bacteria are the cause in about 15% of cases, with the most common types being Escherichia coli, Salmonella, Shigella, and Campylobacter species. If food becomes contaminated with bacteria and remains at room temperature for a period of several hours, the bacteria multiply and increase the risk of infection in those who consume the food. Some foods commonly associated with illness include raw or undercooked meat, poultry, seafood, and eggs; raw sprouts; unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses; and fruit and vegetable juices. In the developing world, especially sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, cholera is a common cause of <b>gastroenteritis.</b> This infection is usually transmitted by contaminated water or food.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} {{that there were two}} billion cases of <b>gastroenteritis</b> that resulted in 1.3million deaths globally in 2015. Children and those in the developing world are most commonly affected. As of 2011, in those less than five, there were about 1.7billion cases resulting in 0.7million deaths, with most of these occurring in the world's poorest nations. More than 450,000 of these fatalities are due to rotavirus in children under 5years of age. Cholera causes about three to five million cases of disease and kills approximately 100,000 people yearly. In the developing world, children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year that result in significant <b>gastroenteritis.</b> It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of acquired immunity.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{the same}} agents cause <b>gastroenteritis</b> in cats and dogs as in humans. The most common organisms are Campylobacter, Clostridium difficile, Clostridium perfringens, and Salmonella. A large number of toxic plants may also cause symptoms.|$|E
5|$|Some {{agents are}} more {{specific}} {{to a certain}} species. Transmissible <b>gastroenteritis</b> coronavirus (TGEV) occurs in pigs resulting in vomiting, diarrhea, and dehydration. It {{is believed to be}} introduced to pigs by wild birds and there is no specific treatment available. It is not transmissible to humans.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{protozoa}} can cause <b>gastroenteritis</b> – most commonly Giardia lamblia – but Entamoeba histolytica, Cryptosporidium spp., {{and other species}} have also been implicated. As a group, these agents comprise about 10% of cases in children. Giardia occurs more commonly in the developing world, but this etiologic agent causes this type of illness to some degree nearly everywhere. It occurs more commonly in persons who have traveled to areas with high prevalence, children who attend day care, {{men who have sex}} with men, and following disasters.|$|E
5|$|Agaricus hondensis {{mushrooms}} are toxic, and consuming the fruit bodies causes <b>gastroenteritis.</b> Some fruit bodies smell of creosote, an odor that {{becomes even more}} prevalent if the {{mushrooms are}} cooked. Cooking also introduces an unpleasant soapy-metallic flavor. The fruit bodies are used as food by the vagrant shrew (Sorex vagrans) and the American shrew mole (Neurotrichus gibbsii). Relatively high levels of the chemical hydroquinone are present in fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|During his {{recuperation}} Formby contracted <b>gastroenteritis</b> and had {{a suspected}} blood clot on his lung, after which he underwent an operation to clear a fishbone that was stuck in his throat. He had recovered sufficiently by April 1953 to undertake a 17-show tour of Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe), before a special appearance at the Southport Garrick Theatre. That September {{he turned on the}} Blackpool Illuminations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gastroenteritis</b> can {{be due to}} infections by viruses, bacteria, parasites, and fungus. The {{most common}} cause is viruses. In {{children}} rotavirus {{is the most common}} cause of severe disease. In adults, norovirus and Campylobacter are common. Transmission may occur due to eating improperly prepared foods, drinking contaminated water, or through close contact with an individual who is infected. Testing to confirm the diagnosis is typically not needed.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Jacob Light and Horace Hodes {{proved that}} a {{filterable}} {{agent in the}} faeces of children with infectious diarrhoea also caused scours (livestock diarrhoea) in cattle. Three decades later, preserved samples of the agent were shown to be rotavirus. In the intervening years, a virus in mice was shown {{to be related to}} the virus causing scours. In 1973, Ruth Bishop and colleagues described related viruses found in children with <b>gastroenteritis.</b>|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that two billion cases of <b>gastroenteritis</b> resulted in 1.3million deaths globally in 2015. Children {{and those in the}} developing world are most commonly affected. As of 2011, in those below age five, there were about 1.7billion cases resulting in about 700,000 deaths. In the developing world children less than two years of age frequently get six or more infections a year. It is less common in adults, partly due to the development of immunity.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{poisoning}} shares symptoms {{with other}} conditions {{and may be}} easily missed. Conditions that present similarly and must be ruled out in diagnosing lead poisoning include carpal tunnel syndrome, Guillain–Barré syndrome, renal colic, appendicitis, encephalitis in adults, and viral <b>gastroenteritis</b> in children. Other differential diagnoses in children include constipation, abdominal colic, iron deficiency, subdural hematoma, neoplasms of the central nervous system, emotional and behavior disorders, and intellectual disability.|$|E
5|$|Norovirus is {{the leading}} cause of <b>gastroenteritis</b> among adults in America, causing greater than 90% of outbreaks. These {{localized}} epidemics typically occur when groups of people spend time in close physical proximity to each other, such as on cruise ships, in hospitals, or in restaurants. People may remain infectious even after their diarrhea has ended. Norovirus is the cause of about 10% of cases in children.|$|E
5|$|On 3 March 2013, Elizabeth was {{admitted}} to King Edward VII's Hospital as a precaution after developing symptoms of <b>gastroenteritis.</b> She returned to Buckingham Palace the following day. A week later, she signed the new Commonwealth charter. Because of her age {{and the need for}} her to limit travelling, in 2013 she chose not to attend the biennial meeting of Commonwealth heads of government {{for the first time in}} 40 years. She was represented at the summit in Sri Lanka by her son, Prince Charles.|$|E
5|$|Other {{potential}} {{causes of}} {{signs and symptoms}} that mimic those seen in <b>gastroenteritis</b> {{that need to be}} ruled out include appendicitis, volvulus, inflammatory bowel disease, urinary tract infections, and diabetes mellitus. Pancreatic insufficiency, short bowel syndrome, Whipple's disease, coeliac disease, and laxative abuse should also be considered. The differential diagnosis can be complicated somewhat if the person exhibits only vomiting or diarrhea (rather than both).|$|E
5|$|The longest {{documented}} {{giant otter}} lifespan {{in the wild}} is eight years. In captivity, this may increase to 17, with an unconfirmed record of 19. The animal is susceptible {{to a variety of}} diseases, including canine parvovirus. Parasites, such as the larvae of flies and a variety of intestinal worms, also afflict the giant otter. Other causes of death include accidents, <b>gastroenteritis,</b> infanticide, and epileptic seizures.|$|E
5|$|The {{signs and}} {{symptoms}} of malaria typically begin 8–25 days following infection; however, symptoms may occur later in those who have taken antimalarial medications as prevention. Initial manifestations of the disease—common to all malaria species—are similar to flu-like symptoms, and can resemble other conditions such as sepsis, <b>gastroenteritis,</b> and viral diseases. The presentation may include headache, fever, shivering, joint pain, vomiting, hemolytic anemia, jaundice, hemoglobin in the urine, retinal damage, and convulsions.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton {{was hospitalized}} on December 30, 2012, for anticoagulation {{treatment}} of venous thrombosis {{of the right}} transverse sinus, which {{is located at the}} base of the brain. Clinton's thrombotic episode was discovered on an MRI scan done for follow-up of a cerebral concussion she had suffered 2.5 weeks before after she fell while suffering from <b>gastroenteritis.</b>|$|E
5|$|Viruses (particularly rotavirus) and the {{bacteria}} Escherichia coli and Campylobacter species {{are the primary}} causes of <b>gastroenteritis.</b> There are, however, many other infectious agents that can cause this syndrome. Non-infectious causes are seen on occasion, but {{they are less likely}} than a viral or bacterial cause. Risk of infection is higher in children due to their lack of immunity and relatively poor hygiene.|$|E
5|$|Western jackdaws {{have learned}} to peck open the foil caps of milk bottles left on the doorsteps after {{delivery}} by the milkman. The bacterium Campylobacter jejuni has been isolated from their beaks and cloacae so milk can become contaminated as they drink. This activity was linked to cases of Campylobacter <b>gastroenteritis</b> in Gateshead in northeast England and led the Department of Health to suggest that milk from bottles which had been pecked open should be discarded. It was recommended that steps be taken to prevent birds attacking bottles in future.|$|E
5|$|Amnesic {{shellfish}} poisoning (ASP) {{was first}} reported in eastern Canada in 1987. It {{is caused by}} the substance domoic acid found in certain diatoms of the genus Pseudo-nitzschia. Bivalves can become toxic when they filter these microalgae out of the water. Domoic acid is a low-molecular weight amino acid that is able to destroy brain cells causing memory loss, <b>gastroenteritis,</b> long-term neurological problems or death. In an outbreak in the western United States in 1993, finfish were also implicated as vectors, and seabirds and mammals suffered neurological symptoms. In the United States and Canada, a regulatory limit of 20µg/g of domoic acid in shellfish meat is set.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{not usually}} used for <b>gastroenteritis,</b> {{although}} they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates {{of resistance to the}} latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and treating it with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.|$|E
5|$|Cyanogenic glycosides {{are stored}} in {{inactive}} forms in plant vacuoles. They become toxic when herbivores eat the plant and break cell membranes allowing the glycosides to {{come into contact with}} enzymes in the cytoplasm releasing hydrogen cyanide which blocks cellular respiration. Glucosinolates are activated {{in much the same way}} as cyanogenic glucosides, and the products can cause <b>gastroenteritis,</b> salivation, diarrhea, and irritation of the mouth. Benzoxazinoids, secondary defence metabolites, which are characteristic for grasses (Poaceae), are also stored as inactive glucosides in the plant vacuole. Upon tissue disruption they get into contact with β-glucosidases from the chloroplasts, which enzymatically release the toxic aglucones. Whereas some benzoxazinoids are constitutively present, others are only synthesised following herbivore infestation, and thus, considered inducible plant defenses against herbivory.|$|E
