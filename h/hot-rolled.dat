40|$|In dry toner electrophotography, <b>hot-roll</b> fusing is {{the method}} most {{commonly}} used to fix the toner to the media. In <b>hot-roll</b> fusing, the combined effects of time, temperature and pressure determine the fusing quality {{with respect to the}} degree of toner fixing and gloss level. Acceptable fusing quality can only be achieved when the process parameters are within the fusing latitude, or “fusing window. ” In this paper, the effect of the fusing process parameters on gloss is studied experimentally using a computer-controlled <b>hot-roll</b> test apparatus. The roles of media and coating are also examined for insight into the mechanisms of gloss development.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{determine}} the influence of <b>hot-rolling</b> conditions on structure of new-developed high-manganese austenitic steels. Design/methodology/approach: Flow stresses during continuous and multi-stage compression tests were measured using the Gleeble 3800 thermo-mechanical simulator. To describe the hot-working behaviour, the steels were compressed to the various amount of deformation (4 x 0. 29, 4 x 0. 23 and 4 x 0. 19). The microstructure evolution in different stages of <b>hot-rolling</b> was determined in metallographic investigations using light microscopy as well as X-ray diffraction. Findings: The steels are characterized by different microstructure in the initial state. Steel with higher Al concentration has stable microstructure of austenite with annealing twins, while steel with higher Si concentration consists of certain portion of ε martensite in form of plates. The flow stresses are in the range of 200 - 430 MPa for the applied conditions of hot-working and are up to 40 MPa lower compared to continuous compressions. Results of the multi-stage compression proved that applying the true strain 4 x 0. 29 gives the possibility to refine the austenite microstructure as a result of dynamic recrystallization. In case of applying the lower deformations 4 x 0. 23 and 4 x 0. 19, the process controlling work hardening is dynamic recovery. On the basis of analysis of thermo-mechanical treatment carried out in continuous axisymetrical compression test and multi-stage compression test using the Gleeble 3800 simulator allowed to work out a schedule of three different variants of <b>hot-rolling</b> for each of investigated steels 26 Mn- 3 Si- 3 Al-Nb-Ti and 27 Mn- 4 Si- 2 Al-Nb-Ti. Research limitations/implications: To fully describe the <b>hot-rolling</b> behaviour of the new-developed steels, further investigations in wider temperature and strain rate ranges are required. Practical implications: Various conditions of <b>hot-rolling</b> for advanced high-manganese austenitic steels can be useful to determine influence of microstructure on mechanical properties obtained in static and dynamic tensile test. Originality/value: Microstructure evolution in various conditions of <b>hot-rolling</b> for advanced high-manganese austenitic steels were investigated...|$|R

50|$|Design {{standards}} for <b>hot-rolled</b> steel (see structural steel) were adopted in 1930s, {{but were not}} applicable to cold-formed sections because of their relatively thin steel walls which were susceptible to buckling. Cold-formed steel members maintain a constant thickness around their cross-section, whereas <b>hot-rolled</b> shapes typically exhibit tapering or fillets. Cold-formed steel allowed for shapes which differed greatly from the classical <b>hot-rolled</b> shapes. The material was easily workable; it could be deformed into many possible shapes. Even a small change in the geometry created {{significant changes in the}} strength characteristics of the section. It was necessary to establish some minimum requirements and laws to control the buckling and strength characteristics. Also it was observed that the thin walls underwent local buckling under small loads in some sections and that these elements were then capable of carrying higher loads even after local buckling of the members.|$|E

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{objective in}} the development of <b>hot-roll</b> fusing sub-systems in electrophotography is to optimize fusing latitude. A broad fusing latitude, defined by the temperature range between which cold and hot offset occurs, is a critical factor in achieving a robust printing process and ensuring the highest print quality. With the recent introduction of a stand-alone, computer-controlled <b>hot-roll</b> fusing test apparatus, developers of toners, toner resins, print media, fuser rollers, fusing sub-systems, and related products now have available to them a highly flexible tool that greatly enhances both objectivity and productivity in optimizing and characterizing the <b>hot-roll</b> fusing process. The system allows the user to control the process speed, the contact load between the rollers, the temperature range, and the lubrication. In addition to the flexibility it affords in controlling the process variables, the modular design of the system enables the user to change the fuser rollers with ease and to control heating of the fusing and pressure rollers independently. System design considerations and a range of practical application examples are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} achieve the nonsmooth surface drag {{reduction}} structure on the inner polymer coating {{of oil and gas}} pipelines and improve the efficiency of pipeline transport, a structural model of the machining robot on the pipe inner coating is established. Based on machining robot, an experimental technique is applied to research embossing and coating problems of rolling-head, and then the molding process rules under different conditions of rolling temperatures speeds and depth are analyzed. Also, an orthogonal experiment analysis method is employed to analyze the different effects of <b>hot-rolling</b> process apparatus on the embossed pits morphology and quality of rolling. The results also reveal that elevating the rolling temperature or decreasing the rolling speed can also improve the pit structure replication rates of the polymer coating surface, and the rolling feed has little effect on replication rates. After the rolling-head separates from the polymer coating, phenomenon of rebounding and refluxing of the polymer coating occurs, which is the reason of inability of the process.
