40|$|The {{removal of}} iron {{impurities}} to desired regions in silicon wafers {{has been studied}} using phosphorus and boron doped layers and bulk defects as <b>gettering</b> sites. Techniques to remove metal impurities, so-called <b>gettering</b> techniques, are needed for improving the performance of both the microelectronic and photovoltaic silicon devices, although the desired location of impurities may be different in various applications. In this work, both separate and simultaneous influences of the doped layers and bulk defects on the <b>gettering</b> behaviour of iron, e. g. the <b>gettering</b> efficiency and <b>gettering</b> mechanisms, were investigated. The phosphorus diffusion <b>gettering</b> studies at low temperatures enabled the determination of a more accurate segregation coefficient for iron between a phosphorus diffused layer and bulk silicon. Comparison between the phosphorus diffusion <b>gettering</b> experiments and similar experiments with boron showed that boron diffusion <b>gettering</b> can in some cases be nearly {{as effective as the}} phosphorus diffusion <b>gettering.</b> The <b>gettering</b> studies with implanted boron layers revealed that the <b>gettering</b> occurs also by precipitation, not only by segregation. Competitive <b>gettering</b> between an implanted boron layer and bulk defects was investigated using specially designed <b>gettering</b> anneals. It was found that depending on the desired location of iron in silicon wafers in different applications, iron can be collected either to the doped layers or the bulk defects. The <b>gettering</b> anneals were also applied to a microelectronic device process and their effect on the electronic device parameters was evaluated. These results contribute to the understanding of iron behaviour in silicon.

5|$|The largest use {{of calcium}} is in steelmaking, {{due to its}} strong {{chemical}} affinity for oxygen and sulfur. Its oxides and sulfides, once formed, give liquid lime aluminate and sulfide inclusions in steel which float out; on treatment, these inclusions disperse throughout the steel and became small and spherical, improving castability, cleanliness and general mechanical properties. Calcium is also used in maintenance-free automotive batteries, in which the use of 0.1% calcium–lead alloys {{instead of the usual}} antimony–lead alloys leads to lower water loss and lower self-discharging. Due to the risk of expansion and cracking, aluminium is sometimes also incorporated into these alloys. These lead–calcium alloys are also used in casting, replacing lead–antimony alloys. Calcium is also used to strengthen aluminium alloys used for bearings, for the control of graphitic carbon in cast iron, and to remove bismuth impurities from lead. Calcium metal is found in some drain cleaners, where it functions to generate heat and calcium hydroxide that saponifies the fats and liquefies the proteins (for example, those in hair) that block drains. Besides metallurgy, the reactivity of calcium is exploited to remove nitrogen from high-purity argon gas and as a <b>getter</b> for oxygen and nitrogen. It is also used as a reducing agent in the production of chromium, zirconium, thorium, and uranium. It {{can also be used to}} store hydrogen gas, as it reacts with hydrogen to form solid calcium hydride, from which the hydrogen can easily be re-extracted.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Phosphorus {{diffusion}} <b>gettering</b> of multicrystalline silicon {{solar cell}} materials generally fails to produce material with minority-carrier lifetimes that approach that of <b>gettered</b> monocrystalline wafers, {{due largely to}} higher levels of contami-nation with metal impurities and a higher density of structural de-fects. Higher <b>gettering</b> temperatures should speed the dissolution of precipitated metals by increasing their diffusivity and solubility in the bulk, potentially allowing for improved <b>gettering.</b> In this pa-per, we investigate the impact of <b>gettering</b> at higher temperatures on low-purity multicrystalline samples. To analyze the <b>gettering</b> response, we measure the spatially resolved lifetime and intersti-tial iron concentration by microwave photoconductance decay and photoluminescence imaging, and the structural defect density by Sopori etching and large-area automated quantification. Higher temperature phosphorus diffusion <b>gettering</b> is seen to improve metal-limited multicrystalline materials dramatically, especially in areas of low etch pit density. In areas of high as-grown dislocation density in the multicrystalline materials, it appears that higher temperature phosphorus diffusion <b>gettering</b> reduces the etch pit density, but leaves higher local concentrations of interstitial iron, which degrade lifetime.

Only {{a small amount of}} the expensive high purity silicon is needed for the epitaxial deposition on a low-cost silicon substrate made from e. g. metallurgical grade (MG) or upgraded metallurgical grade (UMG) silicon.
