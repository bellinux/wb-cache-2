50|$|Theca lutein cyst {{is a type}} of {{bilateral}} functional ovarian cyst filled with clear, straw-colored fluid. To be classified a <b>functional</b> <b>cyst,</b> the mass must reach a diameter of at least three centimeters.|$|E
50|$|This type of <b>functional</b> <b>cyst</b> occurs {{after an}} egg has been {{released}} from a follicle. The follicle then becomes a secretory gland that {{is known as the}} corpus luteum. The ruptured follicle begins producing large quantities of estrogen and progesterone in preparation for conception. If a pregnancy doesn't occur, the corpus luteum usually breaks down and disappears. It may, however, fill with fluid or blood, causing the corpus luteum to expand into a cyst, and stay in the ovary. Usually, this cyst is on only one side, and does not produce any symptoms.|$|E

30|$|The {{incidence}} of adnexal masses during pregnancy comprises 2 % of all cases, {{with most of}} the masses discovered during the first trimester being <b>functional</b> <b>cysts</b> that resolve spontaneously. Persistent masses are most commonly <b>functional</b> <b>cysts</b> or dermoid cysts [1 – 3].

30|$|Conservative {{management}} of a symptom-free adnexal mass with a benign aspect on ultrasound examination {{can be justified}} until the 16 th week of gestation for two reasons. First, it is stated that an adnexal mass before the 16 th week of gestation is often a <b>functional</b> <b>cyst</b> and the incidence of these cysts after 16 weeks is minimal [1, 3]. However, in our series one patient still had a persistent <b>functional</b> <b>cyst</b> after this period (case no.  9). Second, {{we have to consider}} the direct risk of surgery to the foetus early in pregnancy. Surgery is thought to be related to an increased risk of spontaneous abortion. Although laparoscopy in the third trimester has been described by some authors, it causes technical difficulties due to the enlarged uterus (Table  2) [17, 18]. Therefore, in our opinion, if laparoscopy is necessary, the second trimester seems to be the optimum period for surgery to be performed.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study is to assess the {{prevalence}} of abnormal CT findings in patients with surgically proven ruptured endometriotic cysts, as compared with those abnormal CT findings of ruptured ovarian <b>functional</b> <b>cysts.</b> Materials and Methods: This study included 13 retrospectively identified patients with surgically confirmed ruptured ovarian endometriotic cysts and who had also undergone preoperative CT scanning during the previous seven years. As a comparative group, 25 cases of surgically confirmed ruptured ovarian <b>functional</b> <b>cysts</b> were included. We assessed the morphologic features of the cysts and the ancillary findings based on CT. Results: For the endometriotic cysts, the mean maximum cyst diameter was significantly larger than that of the <b>functional</b> <b>cysts</b> (70. 1 mm versus 36. 4 mm, respectively, p < 0. 05). The endometriotic cysts frequently had a multilocular shape and a thicker cyst wall, as compared to that of <b>functional</b> <b>cysts,</b> and these differences were statistically significant. Among the ancillary findings, endometriotic cysts showed a significantly higher prevalence of loculated ascites, ascites confined to the pelvic cavity without extension to the upper abdomen, and peritoneal strandings and infiltrations (p < 0. 05). Although 11 of the 25 cases of <b>functional</b> <b>cysts</b> showed active extravasation of contrast material at the ovarian bleeding site, only one of 13 cases of endometriotic cysts showed active extravasation. Conclusion: The diagnosis of ruptured endometriotic cyst should be suspected for a woman in whom CT reveals the presence of multilocular or bilateral ovarian cysts with a thick wall and loculated ascites confined to the pelvic cavity with pelvic fat infiltrations...|$|R
25|$|<b>Functional</b> <b>cysts</b> and hemorrhagic ovarian cysts usually resolve spontaneously. However, {{the bigger}} an ovarian cyst is, {{the less likely}} it is to {{disappear}} on its own. Treatment may be required if cysts persist over several months, grow, or cause increasing pain.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To evaluate, in {{patients}} with benign and malignant ovarian cysts, serum samples and ovarian intracystic fluids {{for the presence of}} tumor markers such as CA 125, CA 15. 3, tissue polypeptide antigen (TPA), CA 19. 9 and the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA). MATERIAL AND METHOD: We studied overall 64 patients with ovarian pathology. Sixteen patients were affected by <b>functional</b> <b>cysts,</b> 28 women by benign cystic tumors and 20 by cystoadenocarcinomas. RESULTS: Average serum levels of all but CA 15. 3, TPA and CEA tumor markers of benign cystic ovarian tumors were higher than those of <b>functional</b> <b>cysts.</b> All but CA 19. 9 mean intracystic fluid markers levels were more elevated in benign tumors than in <b>functional</b> <b>cysts.</b> In patients with malignant cystic tumors, all but CEA mean serum marker levels were higher than those of benign tumors; furthermore even all mean intracystic levels of markers were more elevated than those of benign tumors.

30|$|Functional cysts are {{the most}} {{commonly}} encountered cystic masses in women of reproductive age as {{a normal part of}} the menstrual cycle, including follicles (diameter < 20  mm), dominant follicles (diameter 20 – 25  mm), follicular cysts (resulting from persistence of an unruptured follicle) and corpus luteum cysts (resulting from a failure of the corpus luteum to regress). The latter one may enlarge because of an internal bleeding, showing high signal on T 1 -weighted images: follow-up is able to differentiate haemorrhagic corpus luteum cysts from endometrioma considering complete resolution of the <b>functional</b> <b>cyst.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{incidence}} {{of ovarian cancer}} in adolescents comprises only about 1 % of all malignant gynecologic tumors in these lesions. On the other hand, {{it is known that}} an adnexal mass may be neither ovarian nor tubal in origin. For instance, inflammatory disorders of the intestines or embryogenic duct remnant cysts can also present as painful adnexal masses. Interpretation of clinical findings and symptoms should, however, be made with caution, because adolescence is known to be accompained by anovulatory cycles that may cause <b>functional</b> <b>cyst</b> formation. Conservative and surgical approaches have been described to manage adolescent females with palpaple and painful adnexal masses. This causes a management dilemma, particulary in adolescent females in whom the possibility of functional cysts appears to be increased.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{determine}} the diagnostic performance of subjective evaluation of ultrasound findings (pattern recognition) {{with regard to}} making a specific diagnosis in adnexal masses. Methods: Some 1066 patients in the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis study were included.

50|$|Ovaries {{normally}} grow cyst-like structures called follicles each month. Once an egg {{is released}} from its follicle during ovulation, follicles typically deflate.

40|$|Adnexal torsion is an {{infrequent}} {{but significant}} cause of acute lower abdominal pain in women. While adnexal torsion {{is generally considered}} in premenopausal women presenting with acute abdominal pain and a pelvic mass, it is a rare cause of acute abdominal pain during postmenopausal period. The diagnosis of adnexal torsion is often challenging due to nonspesific clinical, laboratory and physical examination findings. Causes of adnexal torsion is also different in premenopausal and postmenopausal women. While a simple <b>functional</b> <b>cyst</b> is often the cause of torsion in premenopausal women, it is more rarely the cause in postmenopausal women. Adnexal torsion is a surgical emergency. The surgery of adnexal torsion is performed either via conventional exploratory laparotomy or laparoscopic surgery. Adnexal torsion in postmenopausal women should be considered {{not only in the}} setting of sudden onset pain, but also in long-term abdominal discomfort.

The {{mean age was}} 15.36 [*]±[*] 1.6  years, and the mean diameter of the masses was 54.5 [*]±[*] 1.3  mm. Forty-nine patients (77.7 %) underwent surgical management, and 45 of the 49 surgeries were achieved by laparoscopic surgery (91.8 %). Two converting laparotomies (4 %) were performed. Fourteen patients with a presumed <b>functional</b> <b>cyst</b> were followed up without surgery. Postoperative histopathologic evaluation revealed a benign epithelial ovarian cyst rate of 26.5 %, a mature cystic teratoma rate of 22.4 %, and a borderline ovarian tumor rate of 4.08 %. Non-neoplastic adnexal lesions were encountered in surgeries of 22 cases. The incidence of acute ovarian torsion and true ovarian neoplasm was 9.52 % and 55.1 %, respectively, and none was malignant.

40|$|Background. The {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} whether patients with benign ovarian <b>cysts,</b> <b>functional</b> ovarian <b>cysts,</b> or endometriosis have {{an increased risk of}} developing gynecologic cancer. Methods. The Swedish Hospital Discharge Register was used to identify a cohort of women discharged from hospital with the diagnoses of ovarian cyst (n = 42 217), <b>functional</b> ovarian <b>cyst</b> (n = 17 998), or endometriosis (n = 28 163). To each case, three controls were matched. The National Swedish Cancer Register matched all incident cancers diagnosed among cases and controls. From the Fertility Register, the date of birth of children born to the cases and controls were obtained. Results. Women with endometriosis had an increased risk for ovarian cancer (OR 1. 34; 95 % CI 1. 03 - 1. 75), but no association was found between ovarian <b>cysts</b> or <b>functional</b> <b>cysts</b> and ovarian malignancy, including all ages. Young women (15 - 29 years old) discharged from hospital for ovarian <b>cysts</b> and <b>functional</b> <b>cysts</b> showed an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer later in life (OR 2. 2; 95 % CI 1. 3 - 3. 9 and OR 1. 8; 95 % CI 1. 5 - 2. 0), as well as women with ovarian cysts who had undergone ovarian cyst resection or unilateral oophorectomy (OR 8. 8; 95 % CI 5. 2 - 15). The risk of developing ovarian cancer was inversely related to parity. Mean age at diagnosis was significantly lower in all three study groups. Conclusion.

A total of 487 patients with adnexal masses underwent laparoscopic surgery in Social Insurance Chukyo Hospital from January 2000 to December 2012. We reviewed 471 cases that fulfilled the criteria set for this study, and examined 10 cases with unexpected ovarian malignancy to analyze their preoperative diagnosis, second surgery, postoperative chemotherapy, and prognosis. The ages of the 471 patients ranged from 13 to 50 years, with a median of 31. Nulliparous patients numbered 321 (68. 1 %).

The {{purpose of}} the present study was to {{evaluate}} a prospective series of consecutive patients with adnexal masses selected with strict preoperative clinical and ultrasonographic criteria. Design. Prospective series of consecutive patients (Canadian Task Force classification II- 2). Setting. Tertiary care university hospitals. Patients. Six hundred and eighty-three consecutive patients under 40 years of age with ultrasonographic evidence of an adnexal cystic mass without thick septa, internal wall papillation, or solid components, except for sonographic pattern suggestive of dermoid. Interventions. Operative laparoscopy and follow-up. Measurements and Main Results. After initial diagnostic laparoscopy in 13 patients with stage 4 endometriosis and extensive bowel adhesions, in 2 patients with large-volume dermoids, and in 1 patient with suspect ovarian and peritoneal implants, the procedure was converted to laparotomy. Therefore, 667 patients were completely managed by laparoscopy. There were 1069 cysts excised. Histologic diagnosis was endometrioma in 57 % of the excised cysts, serous cyst in 13 %, dermoid in 12 %, paratubal in 8 %, mucinous cysts in 5. 3 %, <b>functional</b> <b>cyst</b> in 2. 8 %, other benign histotypes in 1. 1 %, and ovarian malignancies (seven borderline tumors and one endometrioma with a microfocus of G 1 endometrioid carcinoma) in 0. 7 % of the cysts and 1. 2 % of the patients. These last patients are alive with no evidence of disease after a mean follow-up of 62 months. Conclusions.

40|$|Objective To {{assess whether}} the {{analysis}} of cyst content using mean gray value (MGV) can discriminate ovarian endometriomas from other unilocular ovarian cysts in premenopausal women. Methods Stored three-dimensional (3 D) volumes from 54 unilocular ovarian cysts diagnosed in 50 premenopausal women (mean age, 37 (range, 22 – 50) years) were analyzed to calculate the MGV from cyst content. Cysts with solid components or septations were excluded. MGV was calculated in all cases with the Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysisTM technique. The Bmode presumptive diagnosis based on the examiner’s subjective impression was also recorded. Results Sixteen of the cysts resolved spontaneously and were given a final clinical diagnosis of hemorrhagic <b>functional</b> <b>cyst,</b> while 38 cysts were removed surgically (diagnosed histologically as seven simple cysts, three hemorrhagic cysts, 20 endometriomas, five mucinous cysts and three paraovarian cysts). B-mode diagnoses were as follows: seven simple cysts, 18 hemorrhagic cysts, 24 endometriomas, three mucinous cysts and two paraovarian cysts. MGV was significantly higher in ovarian endometrioma when compared with all other kinds of cyst. The receiver–operating characteristics curve showed that using an MGV cut-off ≥ 15. 560 had a sensitivity of 85 % and a specificity of 76. 5 % for diagnosing ovarian endometrioma (area under the curve, 0. 831; 95 % CI, 0. 718 – 0. 944).

40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the performance of}} subjective evaluation of ultrasound findings (pattern recognition) to discriminate endometriomas from other types of adnexal masses and to compare the demographic and ultrasound characteristics of the true positive cases with those cases that were presumed to be an endometrioma but proved {{to have a different}} -histology (false positive cases) and the endometriomas missed by pattern recognition (false negative cases). METHODS: All patients in the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) studies were included for analysis. In the IOTA studies, patients with an adnexal mass that were preoperatively examined by expert sonologists following the same standardized ultrasound protocol were prospectively included in 21 international centres. Sensitivity and specificity to discriminate endometriomas from other types of adnexal masses using pattern recognition were calculated. Ultrasound and some demographic variables of the masses presumed to be an endometrioma were analysed (true -positives and false positives) and compared with the variables of the endometriomas missed by pattern recognition (false negatives) as well as the true negatives. RESULTS: IOTA phase 1, 1 b and 2 included 3511 patients of which 2560 were benign (73 %) and 951 malignant (27 %). The dataset included 713 endometriomas. Sensitivity and specificity for pattern recognition were 81 % (577 / 713) and 97 % (2723 / 2798). The true positives were more often unilocular with ground glass echogenicity than the masses in any other category. Among the 75 false positive cases, 66 were benign but 9 were malignant (5 borderline tumours, 1  rare primary invasive tumour and 3 endometrioid adenocarcinomas). The presumed diagnosis suggested by the sonologist in case of a missed endometrioma was mostly <b>functional</b> <b>cyst</b> or cystadenoma.

Methods: Clinical records were retrieved of women who had surgical management for adnexal tumors in the study period, i. e. from January 2007 to December 2010 at Sri Manakula Vinayagar Medical College and Hospital, Puducherry. Results: There were 112 cases of ovarian tumors and tumor like lesions. 70. 5 % were diagnosed as ovarian tumors, 12. 5 % were <b>functional</b> <b>cysts,</b> 10. 7 % were paraovarian and paratubal cysts, 6. 25 % were hemorrhagic infarct where histopathology could not be reported.
