40|$|The National Ignition Facility (NIF) is {{the world}} largest and most {{energetic}} laser system for Inertial Confinement Fusion (ICF). In 2010, NIF began ignition experiments using cryogenically cooled targets containing layers of the tritium-hydrogen-deuterium (THD) fuel. The 75 {micro}m thick layer is formed inside of the 2 mm target capsule at temperatures of approximately 18 K. The ICF target designs require sub-micron smoothness of the THD ice layers. Formation of such layers is still an active research area, requiring a flexible control system capable of executing the evolving layering protocols. This task is performed by the Cryogenic Target Subsystem (CTS) of the NIF Integrated Computer Control System (ICCS). The CTS provides cryogenic temperature control with the 1 mK resolution required for beta-layering and for the thermal <b>gradient</b> <b>fill</b> of the capsule. The CTS also includes a 3 -axis x-ray radiography engine for phase contrast imaging of the ice layers inside of the plastic and beryllium capsules. In addition to automatic control engines, CTS is integrated with the Matlab interactive programming environment to allow flexibility in experimental layering protocols. The CTS Layering Matlab Toolbox provides the tools for layer image analysis, system characterization and cryogenic control. The CTS Layering Report tool generates qualification metrics of the layers, such as concentricity of the layer and roughness of the growth boundary grooves. The CTS activities are automatically coordinated with other NIF controls in the carefully orchestrated NIF Shot Sequence...|$|E
50|$|Many of the {{vectorization}} {{programs will}} group same-color pixels into lines, curves, or outlined shapes. If each possible color is grouped {{into its own}} object, there can be {{an enormous number of}} objects. Instead, the user is asked to select a finite number of colors (usually less than 256), the image is reduced to using that many colors (this step is color quantization), and then the vectorization is done on the reduced image. For continuous tone images such as photographs, the result of color quantization is posterization. <b>Gradient</b> <b>fills</b> will also be posterized.|$|R
40|$|Linear {{gradients}} {{are commonly}} applied in non-photographic art-work for shading and other artistic effects. It is sometimes necessary {{to generate a}} vector graphics form of raster images comprising such art-work with the expectation to obtain a simple output that is further editable, say, using any popular vector editing software. Further, this vectorization process should be automatic with minimal user intervention. We present a simple image vectorization algorithm that meets these requirements by detecting linear <b>gradient</b> <b>filled</b> regions and reconstructing the vector definition using that information. It uses a novel interval gradient optimization scheme to derive large regions of uniform gradient. We also demonstrate the technique on noisy images...|$|R
25|$|The {{effects of}} {{sediment}} on aquatic wildlife {{vary with the}} species {{and the amount of}} contamination. High sediment levels can kill fish directly, bury spawning beds, reduce light transmission, alter temperature <b>gradients,</b> <b>fill</b> in pools, spread streamflows over wider, shallower areas, and reduce production of aquatic organisms used as food by other species. These changes destroy the habitat of valued species, and may enhance habitat for less-desirable species. Existing conditions are already marginal for some freshwater fish in the United States, and the sedimentation of their habitat may result in their extinction. The heaviest sediment pollution of a drainage normally comes within 5 to 25 years after mining. In some areas, unvegetated spoil piles continue to erode even 50 to 65 years after mining.|$|R

40|$|In {{the present}} {{investigation}} the velocity sedimentation technique was analysed with respect to separation resolution, power and sensitivity. It was found that apparative modifications do not influence the resolution, which {{is a function of}} the contribution of apparative errors to the dispersion. A surprisingly small parameter of 0. 15 was determined and it seems unlikely that this value can be improved. On the other hand an apparative modification is presented which improves the separation power and makes sample loading independent of the <b>gradient</b> <b>filling.</b> If cells (from rat bone marrow) were separated, a several times higher dispersion for a given cell volume was observed than was due to the apparative error. It was concluded that density variations were the major source of this dispersion. Since cell volume and density apparently show independent variations within a biological cell population the cell density cannot be disregarded if velocity sedimentation profiles are discussed in physical terms as is often done...|$|R
50|$|The 531&times;879 pixel {{image was}} traced; 50 colors were used. Most (if not all) lines were lost; they were turned into black regions, and their {{effective}} line widths vary. The black outline around the blue food in upper part disappeared. The <b>gradient</b> <b>fills</b> and brushed spots were lost to color quantization/posterization; some brush spots disappeared. Some letters survived the vectorization with distortion, but most letters were discarded. Losing the letters {{is not a}} big issue; post conversion editing would want to delete the annotation and replace it with text rather than curves. Thin lines crossing at a shallow angle made filled regions, and intersecting outlines of filled region became confused; see lower right corner. The tracing also has some odd features. Many black outlines touch, so they become a large, complicated, object rather than just outlines for specific regions. Instead of just background, a rectangular white region separates the two outlined rectangles. The objects labeled op, rp, and rr are not simple layered shapes; the desired result would have rr overlaid by rp which is overlaid by op.|$|R
40|$|Diffusion curves [OBW* 08] {{provide a}} {{flexible}} tool to create smooth-shaded images from curves defined with colors. The resulting image is typically computed by solving a Poisson equation that diffuses the curve colors {{to the interior}} of the image. In this paper we present a new method for solving diffusion curves by using ray tracing. Our approach is analogous to final gathering in global illumination, where the curves define source radiance whose visible contribution will be integrated at a shading pixel to produce a color using stochastic ray tracing. Compared to previous work, the main benefit of our method is that it provides artists with extended flexibility in achieving desired image effects. Specifically, we introduce generalized curve colors called shaders that allow for the seamless integration of diffusion curves with classic 2 D graphics including vector graphics (e. g. <b>gradient</b> <b>fills)</b> and raster graphics (e. g. patterns and textures). We also introduce several extended curve attributes to customize the contribution of each curve. In addition, our method allows any pixel in the image to be independently evaluated, without having to solve the entire image globally (as required by a Poisson-based approach). Finally, we present a GPU-based implementation that generates solution images at interactive rates, enabling dynamic curve editing. Results show that our method can easily produce a variety of desirable image effects...|$|R

The bounds are consistent with findings from recent high-resolution numerical experiments for 1 <= Sc <= 64, but too rough when compared with numerical simulations. A Reynolds number dependence of the bounds is found due to the additional scalar gradient stretching term in the equation of motion. Comment: 6 pages, 2 Postscript figure...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{the demand}} of {{services}} for comic contents increases because paper magazines and books are bulky while digital contents can be read anytime and anywhere with cellular phones and PDAs. To convert existing print comic materials into digital format such {{that they can be}} read using the cellular phones and the PDAs with small screens, it is necessary to divide each page into scene frames and to determine reading order of the scene frames. The division of comic images into the scene frames can be considered as a type of document layout analysis. We analyzed layout of comic images using density gradient. The method can be applied to comics in which comic balloons or pictures are drawn over scene frames. In this research, a method for detecting the scene frame division in comic images using the density <b>gradient</b> after <b>filling</b> the quadrangle regions in each image with black is proposed. Experimental results show that 80 percent of 672 pages in four print comic booklets are successfully divided into scene frames by the proposed method. ...|$|R
40|$|ATP-binding {{cassette}} (ABC) transporters use ATP {{to drive}} solute transport across biological membranes. Members of this superfamily have crucial roles in cell physiology, {{and some of}} the transporters are linked to severe diseases. However, understanding of the transport mechanism, especially of human ABC exporters, is scarce. We reconstituted the human lysosomal polypeptide ABC transporter TAPL, expressed in Pichia pastoris, into lipid vesicles (liposomes) and performed explicit transport measurements. We analyzed solute transport at the single liposome level by monitoring the coincident fluorescence of solutes and proteoliposomes in the focal volume of a confocal microscope. We determined a turnover number of eight peptides per minute, which is two orders of magnitude higher than previously estimated from macroscopic measurements. Moreover, we show that TAPL translocates peptides against a large concentration <b>gradient.</b> Maximal <b>filling</b> is not limited by an electrochemical gradient but by trans-inhibition. Countertransport and reversibility studies demonstrate that peptide translocation is a strictly unidirectional process. Altogether, these data are included in a refined model of solute transport by ABC exporters...|$|R

40|$|Doppler {{measurements}} of trans mitral velocity profiles {{are commonly used}} to assess left ventricular diastolic function. However these velocity measurements provide only information on the convective forces involved in left ventricular filling. The Inertial forces are completely neglected. In this study we evaluated the relative contributions of convective and inertial forces during early left ventricular filling. MethodLeft atrial and ventricular pressures were measured using Millar catheters while simultaneous transmitral color Doppler M-mode velocities were obtained during a series of four open chested canine experiments. The convective contribution ΔPc=pv 2 / 2 was calculated from the maximum transvalvular velocities. Assuming that viscous forces can be neglected, the inertial contribution (ΔPi) to the early diastolic <b>filling</b> <b>gradient,</b> was calculated as {{the difference between the}} invasively measured gradient (ΔP) and ΔPc. The instantaneous ratio of inertial (I) to convective (C) contributions I/C=ΔPi/ΔPc, was computed. The maximum ratio during early filling, I/Cmax, and the ratio {{at the time of the}} peak <b>filling</b> <b>gradient,</b> I/CΔPmax, were calculated. ResultsThe figure illustrates a typical catheter gradient (ΔP) and the convective contribution (ΔPc) with the instantaneous I/C ratio during diastolic filling. During early filling, inertial forces initially dominate the convective contributions to the transvalvular gradient. The I/Cmax= 5. 51 ± 2. 26; and I/CΔPmax= 3. 87 ± 1. 56. ConclusionInertial forces dominate convective forces during early diastolic filling and can not be negleted in the calculation of transvalvular gradients across normal mitral valves. Assessment of inertial forces is important in the interpretation of noninvasive Doppler parameters to assess diastolic left ventricular function function...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of band gap gradients on the charge collection and diode quality factor of solar cells is investigated by device simulation. A back surface band gap gradient manifested as a gradient of the conduction band {{is found to}} lead to an increased diode quality factor. Thus, the positive {{influence of}} the <b>gradient</b> on the <b>fill</b> factor is partially counterbalanced by the diode quality factor increase. The reason for the latter is the enhanced contribution of space charge region recombination. If the cell {{is equipped with a}} double gradient at front and back surfaces, the detrimental diode factor increase can be suppressed. The relevance of the findings is investigated using different carrier lifetimes and doping levels...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Understanding {{the spatial}} pattern of soil lead (Pb) levels is {{essential}} to protecting human health. Most previous studies have examined soil Pb distributions by either urbanization gradient or land-use type. Few studies, however, have examined both factors together. It remains unclear whether the impacts of land use on soil Pb levels are consistent along the urbanization <b>gradient.</b> To <b>fill</b> this gap, we investigated variations in soil Pb level under different land-use types along the urbanization gradient in Beijing, China. We classified the degree of urbanization as the urban core, transitional zone, or suburban area and the land-use type as industrial area, roadside, residential area, institutional area, road greenbelt, park, or forest. Our {{results showed that the}} range of soil Pb levels in Beijing is < 1 mg/kg– 292 mg/kg, with a mean of 22 mg/kg. Along the urbanization gradient, the mean soil Pb level increased from the suburban area to the urban core. Land-use types have an impact on soil Pb levels, however, when the degree of urbanization is considered, the impact from land use on soil Pb level was only significant in the transitional zone. Parks and road greenbelts were found to have lower soil Pb...|$|R
40|$|Background: Non-invasive {{assessment}} of left ventricular (LV) diastolic function {{is an important}} goal to better understand physiologic abnormalities in heart failure. The spatiotemporal pattern of LV blood flow velocities during early filling {{can be used to}} estimate intraventricular pressure <b>gradients</b> driving early <b>filling.</b> MRI can provide accurate flow velocity information in the LV, but this method has not been exploited to assess diastolic function in heart failure (HF). Aim: To assess differences in intraventricular pressure gradients in heart failure and preserved ejection fraction (HFPEF) and heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF), compared to subjects without HF. Methods: We studied 23 subjects without HF, 13 subjects with HFREF and 14 subjects with HFPEF. Intraventricular flow during diastole was measured using 2 D in-plane phase-contrast MRI. We solved the Eulier equations to compute intraventricular pressure gradients during LV early filling (figure) and during ejection. Results: Whereas the initial velocity of wave propagation (was not significantly different between the groups, the terminal diastolic propagation velocity during early diastolic filling was significantly slower (P= 0. 004) in HFREF (5. 2 m/s; 95 %CI= 3. 9 - 6. 8) than in patients with HFPEF (9. 5; 95 %CI= 6. 6 - 13. 6) or subjects without HF (8. 9; 95 %CI= 7. 3 - 10. 7). In contrast, HFPEF was associated with a greater amplitude of the reversal of the base-to-apex intraventricular pressure <b>gradient</b> during early <b>filling</b> (β=- 0. 34; P= 0. 04), which was driven by the inertial component. Conclusions: HFPEF and HFREF are associated with distinct patterns of intraventricular pressure gradient abnormalities during early diastolic filling. Our findings support fundamental differences in the nature of diastolic dysfunction in these 2 conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} {{gradient}} domain object editing approach and its implementation for mobile devices. It {{can be used}} for creating a new composite image by removing, adding, and moving objects in an image. The approach can be divided into two parts: creation and editing of a new gradient vector field, and recovery of a new composite image from the new gradient vector field. In the first part, a new gradient vector field is created from the gradients of the source image, and then updated by inserting the new object gradients, by removing object <b>gradients</b> and <b>filling</b> removed areas with the gradients of best-fit patches found {{in other parts of the}} source image, or by combining these two processes when moving objects. In the second part, a divergence vector field is computed from the gradient vector field and used for a guidance vector to construct a Poisson equation. The new composite image is recovered from the gradient vector field by solving the Poisson equation with boundary conditions. Our approach can merge all regions in the picture seamlessly with smooth color transition for the whole picture. It {{can be used for}} large object removal and for filling the background of the removed object. The final composite image is a globally optimal solution. The approach is implemented and runs with good performance on mobile camera phones. I...|$|R

The strategy is adopted of a sequential nonmonotone improvement of local optima. In particular, to escape the basin of attraction of a local minimum, a suitable gaussian-based filling function is constructed using the quadratic model of the objective function, and added to the objective to fill the basin. Then, a procedure is defined where some new minima are determined, and that of them with the lowest function value is selected as the subsequent restarting point, even if its basin {{is higher than the}} starting one.
