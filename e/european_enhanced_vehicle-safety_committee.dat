40|$|The {{front body}} {{structure}} of an automobile should have sufficient stiffness and strength {{to protect the}} occupants during a high speed frontal collision; simultaneously, it should not induce unduly high impact loads during a low speed pedestrian collision. The above requirements {{appear to be in}} conflict with each other. Traditionally, the design solutions for crashworthiness and pedestrian safety have been addressed separately by designing the front rails and back-up structure of a car for crashworthiness and occupant safety, while optimizing the front bumper for pedestrian impact protection. In the current study, it is shown that it would be more prudent to pose the tasks of designing a vehicle for frontal impact and pedestrian impact safety as a single problem of weight reduction (i. e. lightweighting) by considering major vehicle crash safety requirements in the form of US-NCAP (United States New Car Assessment Program) and IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) offset impact test standards, and pedestrian impact safety according to the EEVC/WG 17 (<b>European</b> <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Vehicle-Safety</b> Committee/Working Group 17) standard.

40|$|Abstract: Car- Pedestrian {{accidents}} cause a loss {{of thousands}} of lives annually in addition to injuries. Therefore, pedestrian protection is one of the important issue in the design of friendly cars. This study shows the performance of finite element head model (FEM) to study and foretelling the extent of injury that occurs at pedestrian accidents and tests the design of the front of vehicle according to <b>European</b> <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Vehicle-Safety</b> <b>Committee</b> (EEVC WG 17) regulations of bonnet test. The FE models are powerful tools and effective method to understand how to reduce the sever ity of the fatalities of injuries in road pedestrian collision incidents.

All of the hood plates and inner hood panel were considered. Head Injury Criterion (HIC), internal energy time history generated in the head and hood, displacement occurred in the hood inner panel and weights of the complete hood are investigated. The results of the study concluded that modification of headform design of the car hood contributes in achieving low HIC and lead to a pedestrian friendly car.

40|$|Truck {{accidents}} {{represent a}} significant factor in the overall road accident scene, namely 25 to 30 % of the fatal accidents in the EU. Collision partners of trucks are mainly passenger cars in car-to-truck frontal collisions. The severity of this kind of accidents is due to the incompatibility of both vehicles. Today's passenger cars are built in a way that occupants stand a high chance of surviving a frontal impact to 56 kph. A truck fit with a rigid Front Underrun Protection Device would supply compatibility, which will reduce the number of 4200 fatalities under the car occupants yearly with 900. However, the average relative speed in car-to-truck frontal collisions is approximately 75 kph. To protect cars at these speeds it is essential that the truck bumper absorbs part of the crash energy. If trucks were equipped with an energy-absorbing Front Underrun Protection System, at least 300 car occupants more would not be killed. This paper describes a combined approach of full-scale crash tests and numerical simulations to predict the effects of rigid and energy absorbing front underrun protection of trucks. The reduction of injuries to driver and passenger was verified in a crash test where the truck absorbed part of the impact energy.

Among the types of injury that may occur in a vehicle-pedestrian collision, lower extremity injuries have the highest account. These alarming statistic has encouraged joining effort from researchers, car manufacturers and the government to find solutions in reducing the risk of vulnerable road users. The car bumper structure design plays a crucial role in cushioning the impact on the pedestrian leg during a collision. The <b>European</b> <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Vehicle-Safety</b> <b>Committee</b> (EEVC) has developed test methods to evaluate severity of the lower leg injury, upper leg injury and head impact injury in a vehicle-pedestrian simulated collision. Since lower extremity injury are most common, undivided attention should be paid on the lower legform to bumper test. The maximum bending angle, maximum shearing displacement and maximum tibia acceleration are among the three injury criterion determined for lower legform to bumper test. Before the lower legform to bumper test can be perform the lower legform has to be certified statically and dynamically. The advancement of computerization had supported the usage of Finite Element Method(FEM) in simulating real life scenarios for analysis. Irregular geometries are now discretized and solved numerically. Finite Element Analysis(FEA) has proven to reduce time and cost significantly therefore the author took advantaged of this tool and simulated a lower legform to bumper collision. This paper presents in detail the static and dynamic certification of the Finite Element (FE) legform model using the HyperWorks software.

The IHRA PSEG is charged {{with the development of}} test procedures for assessing the protection afforded by the vehicle to a pedestrian {{in the event of a}} collision. The Group is seeking to develop these test procedures based on field data on pedestrian accidents. Importantly, the test procedures will take into account different vehicle shapes and pedestrian anthropometry. As with procedures developed by the <b>European</b> <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Vehicle-safety</b> <b>Committee,</b> these procedures will be based on sub-systems representing the head, upper leg and full leg. The Road Accident Research Unit has contributed field data collected in the period 1977 - 2000, showing the importance of protecting the head and lower extremities in a pedestrian collision. The Unit has also participated in an extensive computer simulation task to develop test conditions for different car shapes. A validated MADYMO model of a 50 th percentile male pedestrian was positioned in front of vehicles that represented a range of frontal shapes. The results of the computer simulations were analysed to extract the equivalent subsystem test conditions that reproduce the impacts predicted by the model. Parallel studies were undertaken in Japan and the USA with alternative models, and the results have been compiled and compared. The results showed that the test conditions required in subsystem tests depend on the profile of the car. The study will be extended to models of children and adults of different stature, to produce a comprehensive set of test conditions for pedestrian subsystem tests.

40|$|In {{the current}} test {{procedure}} {{proposed by the}} <b>European</b> <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Vehicle-safety</b> <b>Committee</b> (EEVC) /WG 17 for evaluating leg injuries to pedestrians, a legform impactor with a rigid bony structure is used. The risk of damages to knee ligaments is evaluated with the shearing displacement and the bending angle at the knee joint. A recent study has focused on evaluating biofidelity of the legform. However, {{it was not possible}} to obtain a local deformation at the knee joint from published experiments with Post Mortem Human Subjects (PMHSs). In addition, past PMHS experiments have suggested that the height of a bumper significantly affects the risk of ligamentous damages. In this study, three kinds of finite element models were used in order to investigate the relationship between the bumper height and the shearing displacement / bending angle of the knee; 1) a legform impactor with a rigid bony structure, 2) a recently developed pedestrian dummy (Polar) with both a flexible tibia and a biofidelic knee joint structure, 3) a human lower limb. By utilizing the human model, a local deformation at the knee joint could be obtained. The model for the legform impactor and the pedestrian dummy have been validated against experiments with an actual car and in component level, respectively. The human lower limb model has been validated against published PMHS experiments. The result of a parameter study with these models in a range of bumper heights showed that the dynamic response of the dummy model is quite similar to that of the human model. In addition, it was found that the mass of the upper body significantly affects the bending angle of the knee. A geometric analysis of the knee joint was also performed to obtain tensile strains of four principal knee ligaments as a function of both the shearing displacement and the bending angle. The result suggested that the shearing displacement and the bending angle should be considered in combination when developing an injury criteria for knee ligaments...|$|E

40|$|Statistic studies {{carried out}} during last decades have {{underlined}} as pedestrians - with a prevalence {{of children and}} elderly - are a category with great risk in car accidents, particularly in the urban areas: according to recent investigations of a research committee of the European Community (CEC 2001), {{the risk of death}} in case of accident is, for pedestrians and cyclists, equal respectively to 9 and 8 times vehicle occupants' one. Particularly, in the European Union every year about 7000 pedestrians die (EEVC, <b>European</b> <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Vehicle-safety</b> <b>Committee,</b> "Improved test methods to evaluate pedestrian protection afforded by passenger cars," 1998; ETSC, European Transport Safety Council, "Safety of Pedestrian and Cyclists in Urban Areas,"[1, 5] 1999); that value represents around the 20 % of the total of death caused from road accidents. In the world, this percentage varies from 14 % in the United States (NTSHA, "Traffic safety facts 1994," 1995) at 47 % in Thailandia (D. Mohan, J. Kajzer, K. Bawa Blialla, S. Chawla, S. Sarabjit, Conference on the Biomechanics of Impacts, 1995). Sensitization of the public bodies and of the private companies towards the problem of pedestrian passive safety allowed the start of systematic study in subject, so that the European Committee, in 1988, appointed a working group (WG 10) which, in the 1994, {{at the end of its}} task, has defined a test protocol for the evaluation of the "aggressiveness" of the front part of the vehicle towards pedestrians. This protocol, partially revised in the 1998 [2] by a followed working group (WG 17), establish the use of impactors for simulating, singularly, the body parts that, according to thorough statistic studies, have resulted as the mostly exposed to serious damages: knees, pelvis and the head. For each of these impacts it has been found the area statistically interested from greatest number of serious impacts in order to reach the definition of three types of test: legform to bumper test, upper legform (femur-pelvis) to bonnet leading edge test, head to bonnet top test, using, in that case, impactors of two different measures, adult and child...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical Engineering. During {{the last}} two decades, changes in vehicle design and {{increase}} in the number of the light truck vehicles (LTVs) and vans have led to changes in pedestrian injury profile. Due to the dynamic nature of the pedestrian crashes, biomechanical aspects of collisions can be better evaluated in field studies. Thousands of pedestrians are killed or injured in road traffic accidents. The need to provide and improve pedestrian crash survival research programs in pedestrian collision environment is the subject of much interest and research. At present, the <b>European</b> <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Vehicle-safety</b> <b>Committee</b> (EEVC) test procedure for impacts of various pedestrian subsystems, which represent sections of the human body, provides a means of assessing and rating the impact sites on a vehicle. Development and evaluation of test procedures, such as “ull-body analysis” with the aid of computer simulation for optimizing vehicles on computer for compliance with the testing and evaluation methods proposed by the EEVC, which assess the injury propensity of vehicle structures for pedestrians is needed. The TNO Road Vehicle Research Institute has adopted a fully integrated approach of “ull-body analysis,” which offers a significant advantage over the EEVC method that the entire body of the pedestrian can be considered, including interactions between the individual parts of the body. The purpose of this study is to reconstruct a pedestrian-vehicle accident case by dummy model simulation to provide a way to study the kinematics and potential injuries of pedestrian in any specific impact situation. Study provides flexibility to manipulate model parameters to capture impact responses of the pedestrian. The simulations are carried out at three different dummy positions: side, front and rear. Impact speed, vehicle front shapes, stiffness of vehicle parts and pedestrian height are the key factors, which influence the pedestrian kinematics and injury severity in a pedestrian-vehicle impact. It is most important to evaluate head injury risks as it causes a serious threat to life. Pedestrian-vehicle crash simulations are studied at different impact speeds to replicate accidents involving adult and child pedestrians. These studies are done for the light pickup truck. The overall pedestrian behavior, head impact events to predict possible head impact location and injuries sustained by head, chest and pelvis are determined. There is a correlation between the pedestrian height and the head impact location. The 6 -year old child is more liable to chest injury in impacts with truck. The potential injury to chest and pelvis is more for the child pedestrians in accidents. In general, the injuries sustained by head, chest and pelvis are severe for the high speed crashes since the resultant body velocities are high during post impact kinematics. The research also postulates a method for development of pedestrian compliant vehicle structure to minimize the potential injury ris...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} year, the <b>European</b> <b>Enhanced</b> <b>Vehicle-safety</b> <b>Committee</b> Working Group 12 has {{assessed}} and reviewed {{the performance of}} the enhanced anthropomorphic test device for lateral impacts, EUROSID- 2 (ES- 2). The objectives for this work have been the following: - To verify whether the proposed design is addressing the shortcomings of the regulatory test device EUROSID- 1 as identified previously by EEVC and NHTSA - To make sure that the original EUROSID- 1 biofidelity and performance in normal test conditions is preserved. - To reach a well-balanced conclusion, the working group has undertaken a test program to assess the most important requirements for the ES- 2 dummy, biofidelity, sensitivity, repeatability, handling, durability, certification and full-scale performance in comparison with EUROSID- 1. In addition, but no less important, the working group has reviewed and explored the findings of full-scale tests conducted at several member organisations within ACEA. ACEA has reported the most important findings in September 2000. Subsequently, WG 12 has further investigated the issues raised in this report. On the basis of this work, the working group has concluded the following with regards to the ES- 2 specifications and performance: The ES- 2 prototype as tested is superior to current test device EUROSID- 1 and, hence, a more appropriate test device for regulatory testing. The important shortcomings of the EUROSID- 1 have been satisfactorily addressed with ES- 2, whilst biofidelity is maintained, in some areas even somewhat improved. It should be noted, however, that the assessment of thorax biofidelity was based on deflection and force-time data only, and does not incorporate an assessment of V*C. It is recommended to adopt the hardware design without further modification and to use the new proposed certification procedures, {{with the exception of the}} high velocity pelvis test. Overall test results in full-scale tests have shown that some critical dummy measurement values for ES- 2 have increased compared to EUROSID- 1, in particular rib deflection, 17 %, and V*C, 23 % 1 on average. Other values on the other hand have brought down such as the pubic force (10 %) due to improved leg interaction. Contrary to the full-scale results, the ES- 2 gave equal or lower values for all critical measurements in the biofidelity tests. For the large majority of vehicles tested, the different results would not affect pass or fail with respect to current regulatory limits. It should be noted, however, that, maintaining the rating levels in consumer testing, ES- 2 results would lead motoring consumers to believe the protection offered in side impact has decreased while in fact the safety performance of these vehicles has not changed. A force transducer has been developed to measure the force applied to the back plate. It is recommended to use the force transducer in full vehicle assessment. Finally, the working group believes the ES- 2 dummy forms a solid basis for interim harmonisation and will further support activities to help realise this objective...|$|E

Firstly, a vehicle FE model was developed, a two-layer-material EA (Energy Absorber) and a lower stiffener were also developed to attach in the front bumper system. Then some structure parameters of the EA and the lower stiffener were selected and the design of experiment with orthogonal arrays was used to generate the test sample points. Finally, the multi-objective optimization of the structure parameters was conducted based on the NSGA-II (Non-dominated Sorting Algorithm). The maximum tibia acceleration, the maximum knee bending angle and the maximum shear displacement were chosen as the objective functions. The optimized results were used to redevelop the EA and the lower stiffener FE modals. The {{results of the study}} show that the performance of the vehicle for lower leg protection could be dramatically improved by the optimization of EA and lower stiffener and the second phase EEVC requirements for pedestrian lower leg protection can be satisfied...|$|R
