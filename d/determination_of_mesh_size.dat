40|$|In this study, {{polyacrylamide}} (PAAm) and poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAAm) hydrogels were synthesized via ultraviolet {{light-emitting diode}} (UV LED) (? ~ 365 nm) photopolymerization system. UV LED technology has offered better alternative than UV mercury (Hg) system for curing technology especially for temperature-sensitive polymeric hydrogels {{as it can}} be operated without heat generation and with fast curing response. The control experiment using commercial photoinitiators has shown that UV LED system was suitable to polymerize hydrogels provided that; photoinitiator has the overlap emission with UV LED spectra. However, most commercial photoinitiators have limited solubility in water. Thus, suitable water soluble photoinitiator (WSPI) for UV LED system (i. e. ? ? 330 - 365 nm) was prepared in order to synthesize UV LED curable hydrogel in purely water formulation. The water soluble photoinitiator was obtained from complexation of 2, 2 -dimethoxy- 2 -phenylacetophenone (DMPA) and methylated-ß-cyclodextrin (MßCD). According to the results presented in this work, high monomer conversion (> 90 %) was achieved with WSPI-initiated hydrogels. The non-responsive and responsive behavior of PAAm and PNIPAAm hydrogels towards temperature were demonstrated by swelling and rheological measurements. In addition, swelling and rheological methods gave good correlation for <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>sizes.</b> From rheological measurements, the elastic modulus (G') was higher than the loss modulus (G?) and both parameters were independent to the measured frequency window. It has shown that UV LED cured hydrogels possessed ideal rubber characteristic. Tensile properties of the hydrogels showed similar trend curve as commercial contact lenses reported in the previous study. Clearly, this study has revealed that UV LED system is a good tool to synthesize hydrogels by using the excellent choice of photoiniator...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of Interpenetrating Polymer Networks (IPNs) in biomedical and pharmaceutical fields is continuously growing {{because of their}} mechanical and drug carrier tailoring opportunities. This paper deals with the physico-chemical characterization of an IPN hydrogel based on calcium-alginate and a dextran methacrylate derivative. The {{attention is focused on}} the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> IPN <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> distribution. For this purpose, two different approaches were applied, namely using a combination of rheological and low field NMR characterization, and cryoporosimetry. Appropriate mathematical models were developed for the interpretation of the experimental data. Both approaches led to a monomodal <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> distribution spanning the same size range but characterized by different mean values (25 nm, Rheo-NMR; 44 nm, cryoporosimetry). This is probably due to mesh widening upon water freezing. Moreover, release experiments of a model protein – myoglobin – from the IPN were performed and the obtained data were combined with the results of the two above mentioned approaches. Release tests yielded an estimation <b>of</b> the mean <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> that is closer to that obtained according to the rheology–NMR approach than that resulting from cryoporosimetry measurements...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{crosslinking}} of poly(N-vinylcarbazole) PVK {{resulting from}} UV irradiation (λ > 300 nm) was studied by combining various techniques including infrared spectroscopy, {{size exclusion chromatography}} (SEC), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), swelling ratio, positron annihilation spectroscopy (PAS) and thermoporosimetry.

The <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> (ξ) <b>of</b> the prepared hydrogels {{was determined by}} swelling studies, rheology, and low field NMR spectroscopy. The in vitro release of fluorescein isothiocyanate labeled dextrans (FDs) and bevacizumab was investigated. The average <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> (ξavg) increased from 5. 8 ± 0. 1 nm to 56 ± 13 nm during degradation, as determined by swelling studies. The result of the heological measurements (8. 0 nm) matched theinitial value of ξavg. Low field NMR spectroscopy enabled the <b>determination</b> <b>of</b> the <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> distribution; the most abundant <b>mesh</b> <b>size</b> {{was found to be}} 9. 2 nm. In combination with the hydrodynamic radius of the molecule (Rh), the time-dependent increase of ξavg was used to predict the release profiles of incorporated FDs applying an obstruction-scaling model. The predicted release profiles matched the experimentally determined release profiles when Rh < ξavg. However, significant deviations from the theoretical predictions were observed when Rh ≥ ξavg, most likely due to the statistical distribution of ξ in real polymer networks. The release profile of bevacizumab differed from those of equivalently sized FDs. The delayed release of bevacizumab was most likely a result of the globular structure and rigidity of the protein. The observed correlation between ξ and the release rate could facilitate the design of controlled release systems for antibodies...|$|R
