[...] as the room was described in 1638. As a suite, the rooms were intended to be accessed by a now-blocked door in the Great Chamber. In this way, if an extremely high ranking guest was being entertained, they would then take over the entire suite including the Great Chamber.

2500|$|Zander Hollander, {{who wrote}} The Complete Handbook of Pro Football, said about Gradishar, [...] "Not as nasty as Butkus, doesn't snarl like Lambert, but Gradishar {{makes all the}} plays. Hey, he can hit, too. Just ask Saints' Henry Childs, after Gradishar knocked his helmet off, [...] "It {{was the first in}} my career like that, in the open field". Gradishar's hitting ability was a {{sentiment}} echoed in Rick Korch's book, The Truly Great. In it, Tony Dorsett recalled the hit Gradishar gave him in a 1980 game, [...] "I ran a pass pattern and was wide open but Danny White did not see me. I go back to the huddle and tell Danny that I am wide open. I ran the same route again but this time I was almost decapitated. My eyes were only partially open when I hit the ground. Trainers and doctors came running onto the field. They thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead.</b> Hey, I thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead,</b> too." [...] Hall of Fame defensive lineman Dan Hampton remembers asking Walter Payton, [...] "Walter, who gave you the hardest hit you ever took in the NFL?". According to Hampton, Payton replied, [...] "Randy Gradishar, 1978". In 1981 SPORT magazine named Gradishar one of the Top 5 hardest hitters in the NFL, quoting the modest Gradishar, [...] "The chance for a real good shot comes very seldom, but when it's there I take full advantage of it".|$|E

2500|$|Lionsgate's {{president}} of theatrical marketing Tim Palen {{thought of the}} idea to make 1,000 posters {{with a small amount}} of Bell's blood, which was mixed with the printing ink. He said, [...] "We decided to do a poster and he's wearing a red cloak. I was talking to the printer and asked what we could do to get the deepest blood red. I asked if it would be possible to use actual blood. There was silence. He said, 'We could try, but are you serious?' I said <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead</b> serious." [...] The posters were sold for $20, with the first being auctioned off; all the proceeds from the auctioned poster were donated to the Red Cross. [...] Lionsgate also held the third annual [...] "Give Til It Hurts" [...] blood drive for the Red Cross and collected 23,493 pints of blood.|$|E
2500|$|After {{composing}} two songs, Jorgensen {{considered it}} [...] "easier" [...] writing {{from the perspective}} of being dead. He thought it would be [...] "cool" [...] to expand it into a story where he kept [...] "pretending <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead.</b> I kinda creeped myself out sometimes." [...] Around this time, Jorgensen was going through a break-up [...] "of my first real relationship, which was heartbreaking," [...] combined with [...] "the fact that I had been touring {{for a couple of years}} with Armor for Sleep ... It was a very transitional period, and all those emotions converged." [...] He initially composed the songs before showing them to the rest of the band. Jorgensen wrote the lyrics in isolation. He later pondered [...] "maybe I should have asked for help but it was something I wanted to be from me completely". According to Decicco, every song on the album is in Drop D tuning, often incorporating a ninth chord, which gave a [...] "super rich" [...] sound.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2014, {{during a}} Q session for the album, at SONOS Studios in Los Angeles, California, Schoolboy Q {{described}} the song [...] "Prescription/Oxymoron", {{as the most}} personal: [...] "I came up selling OxyContin," [...] he said. [...] "The karma behind it was that I never took an OxyContin before but I did get addicted to Percocets, Xanax, Codeine—shit like that. When my daughter was one and two , I used to get into sleep comas, like 'Xan comas'—just dead {{to the world and}} I put it into the music." [...] Schoolboy Q said he arranged the song to juxtapose the process of selling prescription pills and addiction: [...] "I put the OxyContin and selling it {{at the end of the}} relapse or the addiction," [...] he said. [...] "I sold OxyContin and then I got addicted [...] This way, I showed that I got addicted then I sold it. That was a crazy record. That's true shit—the first part of it when my daughter tried to wake me up and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead</b> to the world. That was my little secret. I always had the cup with me. They just never knew I had a gang of pills in the other bottle. That was a little story about me and how I was addicted, too." ...|$|E
