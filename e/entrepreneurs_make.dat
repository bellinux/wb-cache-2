50|$|According to Kirzner (1973) and Lavoie (1985) {{entrepreneurs}} reap {{profits by}} supplying unfulfilled needs in all markets. Entrepreneurship therefore brings prices closer to marginal costs. The adjustment of prices in markets towards ‘equilibrium’ (where {{supply and demand}} equal) gives them greater utilitarian significance. The activities of <b>entrepreneurs</b> <b>make</b> prices more accurate {{in terms of how}} they represent the marginal utility of consumers. Prices act as guides to the planning of production.

This internal social capital developed within the platform, which is not available to “normal” serial <b>entrepreneurs,</b> <b>makes</b> serial crowdfunders' campaigns more successful than those launched by novice crowdfunders. However, this type of social capital is a substitute for the internal social capital built by backing other campaigns, and has a limited lifespan.

40|$|This paper derives {{the firm}} value and the {{investment}} strategy (investment timing, debt financing, leverage, and endogenous default) when an <b>entrepreneur</b> <b>makes</b> a real investment with debt financing both in monopoly and in duopoly. In particular, we clar-ify {{the effects of}} the entrepreneur’s financing constraint where a part of the investment cost must be financed by debt. The leverage and the credit spread of the constrained entrepreneur are higher than those of the unconstrained one. The investment timing of the constrained entrepreneur is later, which is consistent with the standard underinvest-ment theory. The financial restriction binds more tightly in duopoly than in monopoly. Surprisingly, however, in duopoly the financing constraint plays a role in moderating the preemptive competition and improving the firm value in equilibrium...|$|R
30|$|In the {{literature}} attempting to explain business creation and entrepreneurial intention and success, a link {{has been established}} with the entrepreneur’s personality traits (De Pillis & Reardon, 2007; Rauch & Frese, 2007; Schmitt-Rodermund, 2004). Indeed, in taking actions and decisions, entrepreneurs use their basic personality make-up, and given that personality and behaviour {{are closely related to}} the national culture, it is likely that entrepreneurs in different cultures might behave differently and have distinct preferences in creating new ventures (Hayton et al., 2002). Goel and Karri (2006) have suggested that the effectuation logic might be altered by personality factors, such as over-trust or the tendency to trust more than what is warranted. In the same way that in applying an effectual logic to an entrepreneurial process, the personality traits of the <b>entrepreneur</b> <b>make</b> him or her more susceptible to over-trust, characteristics of national culture will <b>make</b> <b>entrepreneur</b> more prone to some attributes of the effectual logic than others. Taking up this line of enquiry, several authors have argued that culture is a factor that influences certain aspects of effectuation and causation (Kistler & Gillig, 2015; Kraaijeveld, 2015; Krijgsman, 2012; Stienstra et al., 2012).|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe use {{data from}} {{approximately}} 50, 000 crowdfunding projects {{to assess the}} relative funding performance of for-profit and non-profit campaigns.

Our analysis shows that these results are driven by a small number of very successful for-profit projects.
