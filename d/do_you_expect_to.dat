2500|$|In a major opening chorus, the courtiers {{learn from}} Beatrice's maids {{of the terrible}} torture that {{has been applied to}} Orombello and, [...] "no longer able to {{withstand}} the atrocious suffering, he declared his guilt", thus implicating Beatrice. The Court is summoned and Anichino, Orombello's friend, pleads for Beatrice. Agnese declares that the [...] "longed-for hour of my revenge has come" [...] but, {{at the same time she}} is troubled. Filippo addresses the judges. Beatrice is brought in, and protests: [...] "who gave you the right to judge me?" [...] Orombello then appears and Beatrice is told that she has been denounced. [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> gain from lying?" [...] she demands of him. He desperately seeks forgiveness from Beatrice: under torture [...] "my mind became delirious, it was pain, not I that spoke" [...] and he proclaims her innocence to the amazement of all.|$|E
2500|$|On September 5, a scout {{attached}} to the Jeff Davis Legion, Sgt. George D. Shadburne, gave a report to Wade Hampton on his reconnaissance behind the Union lines. At about 5 miles east of Grant's headquarters at City Point, a supply depot at Coggins Point on the James River, he found [...] "3,000 beeves , attended by 120 men and 30 citizens, without arms." [...] Just two days earlier, Robert E. Lee had suggested to Hampton that Grant's rear area was [...] "open to attack." [...] On September 14, while Grant was in the Shenandoah Valley conferring with Sheridan, Hampton led about 4,000 men in four brigades southwest from Petersburg along the Boydton Plank Road and followed a looping course through Dinwiddie Court House, Stony Creek Station, and by early morning on September 15 had crossed Blackwater Swamp at Cook's Bridge. At 12 a.m. on September 16, Hampton launched an attack in three columns: Rooney Lee's division on the left against the Union troops camped at Prince George Court House, the brigade of Brig. Gen. James Dearing on the right against Cocke's Mill, and the brigade of Brig. Gen. Thomas L. Rosser and a detachment under Lt. Col. Lovick P. Miller in the center to seize the cattle herd. The surprise attacks met only minimal resistance and by 8 a.m., Hampton's men were driving 2,486 cattle south toward Cook's Bridge. A Union attempt by 2,100 cavalrymen under Brig. Gen. Henry Davies, Jr., to intercept the Confederates and their prize was unsuccessful and Hampton retraced his steps back to Petersburg, turning the cattle over to the Confederate commissary department. For days, the Confederate troops feasted on beef and taunted their Union counterparts across the lines. A visitor to Grant's headquarters asked the general, [...] "When <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>expect</b> <b>to</b> starve out Lee and capture Richmond?" [...] Grant replied, [...] "Never, if our armies continue to supply him with beef cattle." ...|$|E
