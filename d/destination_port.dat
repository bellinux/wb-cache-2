5|$|Not long afterwards, the Kriegsmarine {{launched}} Operation Rheinübung. The Bismarck {{and heavy}} cruiser Prinz Eugen set {{out into the}} Atlantic from Norway. Their target was the Atlantic Convoys. During the later stage of the Bismarck operation, a Catalina of No. 209 Squadron RAF spotted the vessel, just 650 miles short of his <b>destination</b> <b>port</b> of Brest, France. It relayed {{the message to the}} British Fleet, enabling Fairey Swordfish aircraft to intercept. An 818 Naval Air Squadron FAA aircraft piloted by Sub-Lieutenant John Moffat hit the Bismarck with a torpedo on its stern, jamming its rudder gears, which eventually led to its sinking. Prinz Eugen had been detached prior to Bismarck last battle. Despite her discovery by Coastal Command's aircraft further south, she escaped to Brest on 1 June. Rheinübung was the last attempt by a Kriegsmarine surface ship to breakout into the Atlantic.|$|E

Reporting to the United States Atlantic Fleet, she was assigned as a convoy escort between New York City and ports in Europe, escorting ships carrying troops and supplies supporting World War I from 30 June and 14 September 1918. On 18 November 1918, she reported to New London, Connecticut to assist in tests of sound equipment which was under development at the time. On 1 January 1919, she was rushed to assist the troop transport [...] which had run aground off Fire Island, New York.

A pressure gradient between Bavi and {{an area of}} high pressure, generated strong to gale force winds of between [...] on various atolls. As a result, various tropical storm watches and warnings were issued for parts of the Marshall Islands, including the coral atolls of Ujae and Ailinglaplap. On the 15 islands {{that make up the}} atoll of Ujae, a significant period of strong winds were reported, which lead to breadfruit trees being destroyed and several houses blown over. Across the Kwajalein Atoll, total damages amounted to over US$1million, with considerable damage reported on the islet of Ebeye. On the main island of Kwajalein, a small amount of tree damage was reported, while several old steel structures were made too dangerous to use. At the missile defense test range on the island, a 3 day rainfall total of [...] was reported between March 9–11. On the islet of Ebeye located about [...] to the north of Kwajalein, high surf caused some coastal flooding while gale force winds damaged structures with tin roofs and plywood walls. Bavis's large waves combined with the high tide caused flooding on various islets of the atoll of Majuro. Within the atoll a yacht struck a reef during March 10, while the fishing vessel Clearwater 2 and its crew of nine were reported missing during March 12, after they became overdue at their <b>destination</b> <b>port.</b> A search and rescue mission was subsequently launched with various good samaritan vessels and two aircraft from the United States Coast Guard and Navy helping to look for the vessel. The search effort subsequently found debris from the ship in various locations along the track taken by Bavi, including to the east of Majuro and southeast of Kwajalein. Total damages to property within the Marshall Islands were estimated at US$2.1million, while the total crop damage was estimated at US$100thousand.|$|E

And we remove these ports with small traffic and have little influence on the network. In order to determine a port is an active port or not, we compute every port’s activity metric D.

30|$|IP {{networks}} are constantly targeted by new techniques of {{denial of service}} attacks (SYN flooding, port scan, UDP flooding, etc), causing service disruption and considerable financial damage. The on-line detection of DoS attacks in the current high-bit rate IP traffic is a big challenge. We propose in this paper an on-line algorithm for port scan detection. It is composed of two complementary parts: First, a probabilistic counting part, where the number of distinct <b>destination</b> <b>ports</b> is estimated by adapting a method called ‘sliding HyperLogLog’ to the context of port scan in IP traffic. Second, a decisional mechanism is performed on the estimated number of <b>destination</b> <b>ports</b> in order to detect in real time any behavior that {{could be related to}} a malicious traffic. This latter part is mainly based on the exponentially weighted moving average algorithm (EWMA) that we adapted to the context of on-line analysis by adding a learning step (supposed without attacks) and improving its update mechanism. The obtained port scan detecting method is tested against real IP traffic containing some attacks. It detects all the port scan attacks within a very short time response (of about 30 s) and without any false positive. The algorithm uses a very small total memory of less than 22 kb and has a very good accuracy on the estimation of the number of <b>destination</b> <b>ports</b> (a relative error of about 3.25 %), which is in agreement with the theoretical bounds provided by the sliding HyperLogLog algorithm.|$|R
2500|$|In early 1945, {{the then}} German city of Swinemünde (Świnoujście in {{contemporary}} Poland) was the <b>destination</b> <b>port</b> for refugees from East Prussia. On the 12th of March 1945, the US Eighth Air Force raided the city. Due to uncertainty concerning {{the number of}} refugees within the city {{the exact number of}} casualties is unknown. As the capacity of air raid shelters was limited to the regular populace, many refugees were killed at the spa gardens. The motor vessel Andros, carrying about 2,000 refugees, had just arrived at the harbour and was sunk with the loss of about 570 people. About 500 victims of the raid were identified and buried close to the entrance of the cemetery and the remaining dead were buried in mass graves. The estimated number of victims, including residents of Swinemünde who were also encompassed by the expulsions, varies from about 5,000 to 23,000. 1958 the West German Government demographic study of expellee deaths estimated the total civilian dead in the East Pommerian [...] region due to Anglo-American air raids after 1/31/45 at 8,000. The German War Graves Commission estimates that 20,000 victims are buried at the Golm War Cemetery with further burials within the town limits.|$|E
2500|$|Lines International Holding (S) Pte. Ltd. v. Singapore Tourist Promotion Board (1997) {{is another}} local {{case in which}} the {{principle}} of irrelevant considerations was raised. The Port of Singapore Authority (PSA), which was responsible for promoting the use, improvement and development of Singapore's ports, had introduced a policy of not allocating berths at the Singapore Cruise Centre to cruise ships unless over a three-month period 30% or fewer of the cruises in a cruise operator's schedule consisted of [...] "cruises-to-nowhere". Such cruises, which left Singapore's territorial waters and returned to Singapore without calling at any other <b>destination</b> <b>port,</b> tended to be mainly for gambling purposes. The plaintiffs argued that in developing this policy, the PSA had assumed that gambling by Singaporeans in international waters was an unlawful activity. As there was no proper legal basis for this assumption, it was an irrelevant consideration which had seriously tainted the formulation of the policy. The High Court denied that this was the case, and found that the main consideration had been whether the development of the cruise industry would be impeded if Singapore gained an undesirable reputation as a hub for gambling cruises. The alleged irrelevant consideration had not been the substantial reason for the ultimate decision.|$|E

30|$|To {{augment the}} live data, we {{simulate}} 3 scans by introducing appropriate flow records into the live data. We simulate an ICMP “ping” scan, a TCP SYN scan (with fixed source and <b>destination</b> <b>ports),</b> and a UDP scan (with fixed <b>destination</b> <b>ports).</b> Each simulated scan probes all 255 {{members of a}} class C subnet within the network perimeter from a spurious source IP address. Partial and rate-limited scans are simulated by subsampling some proportion of the full scans and distributing their event times uniformly over {{the duration of the}} flow being analyzed. Responses from active hosts to the simulated scanning packets were created as follows: ICMP packets generated no response; UDP packets generated either an ICMP Port Unreachable message, a mock UDP response packet, or no response (all with equal probability); TCP packets received an ACK for active hosts (followed by a final RST packet from the scanner). Inactive hosts created no response.|$|R
50|$|The {{southeast}} AMHS route {{system is}} divided into two subsystems: the mainline routes which typically take more than one day for the ship to travel; and shorter routes where the vessels depart their home port in the morning, travel to <b>destination</b> <b>ports</b> and then return to their home port on the same day.

30|$|There {{is clearly}} a {{tradeoff}} {{in the choice of}} the size of the sliding time window W. With a larger time window, one can answer requests concerning larger durations, for example, the number of <b>destination</b> <b>ports</b> in the last 30 min. But to deal with a larger time window, more information has to be stored. More precisely, the upper bound of the used memory (5 m l n(n/m) bytes) depends on n, the number of distinct <b>destination</b> <b>ports,</b> which is closely related to the size of the time window. Moreover, the standard duration of the attack must be considered in the choice {{of the size of the}} time window: W has to be large enough to notice the impact of the attack on the traffic. The port scan attacks last about 20 min and should be detected from the first minute. Thus, W= 60 s is a good choice for the size of the time window. So, the total used memory will be less than 22 kB, which is very reasonable for a router.|$|R
