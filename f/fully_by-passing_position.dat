25|$|The men of 42 Commando {{as much as}} {{possible}} chose to <b>by-pass</b> Egyptian <b>positions</b> and focused on trying to break through inland. The Royal Marines of 40 Commando had the advantage of being supported by Centurion tanks as they landed on Sierra Red beach. Upon entering downtown Port Said, the Marines became engaged in fierce urban combat as the Egyptians used the Casino Palace Hotel and other strongpoints as fortresses.|$|R
2500|$|Gough had {{received}} an intelligence report on 24 August describing the [...] "chequerboard" [...] {{layout of the}} German defensive positions and the tactic of holding back counter-attacking Eingreifdivisionen beyond artillery range. Gough ordered that more troops be used, to ensure that enough would survive to defeat counter-attacks and that the ratio of troops reserved for mopping up behind the foremost infantry should be increased, {{to make sure that}} <b>by-passed</b> <b>positions</b> were occupied. In 1931, Gough wrote that the attack had been made with reduced objectives because {{of the state of the}} ground, to limit the ordeal of the infantry, while conforming to his instructions to continue the battle. An advance of about [...] had been achieved on about a [...] front up to the II Corps boundary. The attack by II Corps on the Gheluvelt Plateau was a success but by 24 August, German counter-attacks had re-taken most of the captured ground. In 1948, James Edmonds, the British official historian wrote that the XIX and XVIII Corps were still overlooked by the German defenders in the [...] from the Ypres–Zonnebeke road northwards to the east end of Langemarck. In 1996, Prior and Wilson wrote that the success of XVIII Corps on 19 August had not been repeated in the wide-front attack on 22 August. The German strongpoints were further from the roads fit to drive on and when the tanks tried to get closer, they had sunk in the mud.|$|R
2500|$|The main Japanese {{position}} was centred on Sanananda and Giruwa. Defensive positions were {{located on the}} coastal flanks at Gona, to the west, and Buna to the east. [...] A further {{position was}} located forward, astride the Sanananda–Soputa track, about [...] from the coast. These were a series of posts which, apart from covering the approach to Sanananda, also denied the use of two branch tracks to Cape Killerton. The three outer defensive positions {{can be considered as}} being located at the corners of a triangle, while the main position was located at the centre of the base. [...] These positions were each separate but, initially at least, they could be readily resupplied and reinforced from the main position. The outer positions covered the likely approaches to Sanananda–Giruwa while the swamp effectively barred any attempt to <b>by-pass</b> these <b>positions.</b>|$|R
2500|$|By 29 November the German 2nd Army had {{eighteen}} divisions around Cambrai. After {{the defensive}} fighting of [...] the divisions had to prepare hurriedly for the counter-offensive of 30 November, {{which was the}} first offensive against the British since the Second Battle of Ypres in April 1915. Similar methods to those used by the British to obtain surprise were used, artillery ranging was minimal, a one-hour bombardment before the attack was planned, with a rolling bombardment moving at a rate of [...] in five minutes to precede the infantry, while the British in Bourlon Wood were to be neutralised by a gas and high-explosive bombardment. Built-up areas were to be bombarded by howitzers and by-passed by the foremost infantry and then attacked from all sides by following troops. Troops moving beyond <b>by-passed</b> British <b>positions</b> in the , were to overcome centres of resistance by infiltration and envelopment, with , light and field artillery accompanying the infantry for the first time, each battery having a platoon of pioneers and a light machine-gun crew; communication was to be assisted by the use of colour-coded light signals.|$|R
5000|$|Marine Scout Bomber Squadron 331 (VMSB-331) {{was formed}} on January 1, 1943 at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point, North Carolina. The {{squadron}} flew SBD Dauntless dive bombers. On June 1, 1943, the squadron's personnel and aircraft were divided to form VMSB-332. Also in June {{of that year}} they were moved {{and became the first}} squadron to arrive at Bogue Field, North Carolina. This was followed by a move to San Diego in September to prepare for movement to the South Pacific. [...] The squadron deployed overseas, finally arriving at Nukufetau Airfield on November 15, 1943. They operated from that island during the invasion of the Gilbert Islands. On November 30, 1943 they sent a detachment to Tarawa to aid in patrol operations until December 26, 1943. In October 1944, the squadron was redesignated Marine Fighter Bomber Squadron 331 (VMBF-331), but they reverted to VMSB-331 on December 30, 1944. [...] The squadron remained the Pacific and carried out air strikes against <b>by-passed</b> Japanese <b>positions</b> in the Marshall Islands {{for the remainder of the}} war.|$|R
2500|$|The Second Army had [...] and howitzers, that fired [...] of ammunition, [...] {{times more}} than that {{available}} for the First Day on the Somme (1 July 1916), to counter the deep German defence zones and Eingreif divisions. Strongpoints were destroyed, wire was cut and German artillery suppressed. Three layers of creeping barrage [...] deep preceded the infantry, who had been trained in the pillbox fighting methods used at Vimy Ridge. The infantry were followed by mopping-up parties, who captured <b>by-passed</b> German <b>positions.</b> Use of such techniques had been possible, because the artillery had become more accurate. The gunners also had more ammunition to use and {{had been able to}} suppress German defences as the British advanced; objectives had been limited to the range of the artillery and had led to a great victory. Prior and Wilson wrote that these methods were not used on 31 July, because Haig had over-ruled Rawlinson, Plumer and Davidson; Gough over-reached and left the British infantry vulnerable to German counter-attacks. Edmonds had written that on 31 July, excessive demands had been placed on the artillery, that had spread its fire too thin.|$|R

5000|$|By 1888, {{the line}} of the cliffs formed by the great {{geological}} fault and the works which had been constructed along its length from Fort Bingemma on the left to Fort Madalena on the right constituted, in the words of Nicholson and Goodenough, [...] "a military position of great strength". The main defects inherent in the defensive position were the extremities where the high ground descended towards the shore, leaving wide gaps through which enemy forces could <b>by-pass</b> the whole <b>position.</b> Particularly weak in this respect was the western extremity. There, a considerable interval existed between Fort Bingemma and the sea. Military manoeuvres held in the area revealed that it was possible for troops to land in Fomm ir-Riħ Bay and gain the rear of the fortified line undetected from the existing works. To counter this threat, recommendations were made for the construction of two epaulements for a movable armament of quick-firing or field guns, the construction of blockhouses, the improvement of the wall which closed the head of the deep valley to the south of Fort Bingemma and the strengthening of {{the line of}} cliffs by scarping in places. It was also suggested that the existing farmhouses in the area be made defensible.|$|R
