The species does occur in the threatened Cool Temperate Rainforest Community in Victoria that is protected under the Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act, {{and it is a}} component of the threatened Southern Escarpment Wet Sclerophyll Forests of far southern New South Wales. Furthermore, planted specimens are frequently stolen from bush regeneration sites as they are desirable garden plants. Conversely in New Zealand, there is a report of T. oreades escaping into kanuka scrub from the trout hatchery gardens on the Tongariro River south of Lake Taupo.|$|E
5|$|Ecology surged {{in popular}} and {{scientific}} interest during the 1960–1970s environmental movement. There are strong historical and scientific ties between ecology, environmental management, and protection. The historical emphasis and poetic naturalistic writings advocating {{the protection of}} wild places by notable ecologists {{in the history of}} conservation biology, such as Aldo Leopold and Arthur Tansley, have been seen as far removed from urban centres where, it is claimed, the concentration of pollution and environmental degradation is located. Palamar (2008) notes an overshadowing by mainstream environmentalism of pioneering women in the early 1900s who fought for urban health ecology (then called euthenics) and brought about changes in <b>environmental</b> <b>legislation.</b> Women such as Ellen Swallow Richards and Julia Lathrop, among others, were precursors to the more popularized environmental movements after the 1950s.|$|E

40|$|This study {{seeks to}} explore {{the impact of the}} Environment Management Act (EMA) (2005) on the {{accountability}} of three companies in Fiji. The study uses a multi-case study approach based on three subsidiaries of a conglomerate.

The findings suggest that the EMA (2005) had some effects in terms of engendering accountability on the companies studied. Further evidence suggests that while this increased accountability has led to disclosures in annual reports and websites, these disclosures are minimal at best; furthermore, they primarily address that the stakeholder group comprised government regulatory authorities.

25|$|The 'Ndrangheta, a {{criminal}} organization from Calabria (Italy) {{has been involved}} in radioactive waste dumping since the 1980s.

In addition, vessels were allegedly sent to Somalia and other developing countries with toxic waste, including radioactive waste cargoes, which were either sunk with the ship or buried on land. The introduction of more rigorous <b>environmental</b> <b>legislation</b> in the 1980s made illegal waste dumping a lucrative business for organized crime groups in Italy.|$|E

These critics believe {{that some of the}} breast cancer organizations, particularly the highly visible Susan G.

25|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>legislation</b> is very strict, {{and every}} tourism project must undergo an {{environmental}} review and a lengthy process of consultations {{with the public}} and conservationists. Seychelles is a world leader in sustainable tourism. The end result of this sustainable development is an intact and stable natural environment, which attracts financially strong visitors (150,000 in 2007) rather than short-term mass tourism. Since 1993 a law guarantees the citizens {{the right to a}} clean environment {{and at the same time}} obliges them to protect this environment.

25|$|<b>Environmental</b> <b>legislation</b> since 1952, {{such as the}} City of London (Various Powers) Act 1954 and the Clean Air Acts of 1956 and 1968, led to a {{reduction}} in air pollution. Financial incentives were offered to householders to replace open coal fires with alternatives (such as installing gas fires), or for those who preferred, to burn coke instead which produces minimal smoke. Central heating (using gas, electricity, oil or permitted solid fuel) was rare in most dwellings at that time, not finding favour until the late 1960s onwards. Despite improvements, insufficient progress had been made to prevent one further smog event approximately ten years later, in early December 1962.|$|E

25|$|Mineral {{admixtures}} {{are becoming}} more popular in recent decades. The use of recycled materials as concrete ingredients has been gaining popularity because of increasingly stringent <b>environmental</b> <b>legislation,</b> and the discovery that such materials often have complementary and valuable properties. The most conspicuous of these are fly ash, a by-product of coal-fired power plants, ground granulated blast furnace slag, a byproduct of steelmaking, and silica fume, a byproduct of industrial electric arc furnaces. The use of these materials in concrete reduces the amount of resources required, as the mineral admixtures act as a partial cement replacement. This displaces some cement production, an energetically expensive and environmentally problematic process, while {{reducing the amount of}} industrial waste that must be disposed of. Mineral admixtures can be pre-blended with the cement during its production for sale and use as a blended cement, or mixed directly with other components when the concrete is produced.|$|E
25|$|Although {{consumer}} electronics {{such as the}} television have been popular since the 1920s, recycling of them was almost unheard of until early 1991. The first electronic waste recycling scheme was implemented in Switzerland, beginning with collection of old refrigerators but gradually expanding to cover all devices. After these schemes were set up, many countries {{did not have the}} capacity to deal with the sheer quantity of e-waste they generated or its hazardous nature. They began to export the problem to developing countries without enforced <b>environmental</b> <b>legislation.</b> This is cheaper, as recycling computer monitors in the United States costs 10 times more than in China. Demand in Asia for electronic waste began to grow when scrap yards found that they could extract valuable substances such as copper, silver, iron, silicon, nickel, and gold, during the recycling process. The 2000s saw a large increase in both the sale of electronic devices and their growth as a waste stream: in 2002, e-waste grew faster than any other type of waste in the EU. This caused investment in modern, automated facilities to cope with the influx of redundant appliances, especially after strict laws were implemented in 2003.|$|E

During the past years the number of <b>environmental</b> <b>legislations</b> increased dramatically while law enforcement agencies expanded their active analysis of companies and their products. The number of companies being accused to sell non-compliant products by both enforcement authorities and competitors increases ever since. The compliance of companies and products is greatly dependent on their internal processes and their ability to adjust to changes. In this paper we introduce a highly applicable process aiming to ensure compliance with various hazardous substances regulations that has been tested successfully in over 70 companies of different industries in Germany. Thereby, we define essential steps, present a standardized approach for material, substance and risk assessment for articles based on existing standards (ISO 31000, 14040, 14044 and EN 50581) and discuss its applicability to different business types related to size, number of employees, suppliers and materials. While the process is found to be appropriate for all business types, the time span required for realization varies significantly. Especially large companies tend to suffer from bureaucratic structures, while small and micro sized companies rather lack of knowledge and availability of resources...|$|R
