5000|$|The first {{crossing}} {{along the}} US 23/441 multiplex is the interchange with US BUS 441, {{which is also}} known as [...] "Old Historic US 441," [...] running south into Baldwin and north through Demorest and Clarkesville. Most intersections from that point on are strictly local street built at grade, however a single connecting ramp from both directions of US 23/441 runs down to the southwest corner of the bridge over the southern terminus of GA 197. Crossing three more local intersections, the routes enter Mount Airy, where GA 365 leaves at a <b>flyover</b> <b>interchange</b> with US 123 and shortly afterwards US 23/441/SR 15 has an intersection with GA 17. Winding north through Mount Airy, the routes have an intersection with Antioch Church Road, cutting off Cobb Road before, and Rockford Cove Road from Rockford Creek Road afterwards. The road climbs a hill approaching Hollywood Hills Road, then descends before making another right curve where the north end of BUS 441 is encountered again, across from GA 17A, although historic US 441 still runs along the west side as an unmarked route. Later the road passes through Turnerville, but encounters no routed intersections. Unmarked Historic US 441 ends just before the routes passes through Tallulah Falls, where they intersect another former section that's marked as Georgia State Route 15 Loop on the east side which is a scenic overlook for the falls. Halfway between the two ends of this loop, it intersects School Road and Gilbert Gate Road then immediately enters Tallulah Gorge State Park. The road curves to the right before approaching {{the other end of the}} scenic loop then curves back to the left under some power lines, passing by the Valley Springs Lodge before finally entering Rabun County.|$|E

This interchange is currently being replaced by a more conventional <b>flyover</b> ramp <b>interchange,</b> as part of the I-95 expansion project under construction since 2007, eliminating the left-turn ramps and I-95's double crossovers. So far, several ramps have been completed, with the ramp from northbound I-95 to eastbound I-695 completed in September 2008, the ramp from westbound I-695 to northbound I-95 completed in October 2008, the ramp from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 completed in November 2008 (eliminating the left-hand exit), and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to southbound I-95 was completed in May 2009. The ramps from southbound I-95 to both westbound and eastbound I-695 were completed in June 2009 and the ramp from westbound I-695 to southbound I-695 was completed in July 2009 and the ramp from eastbound I-695 to northbound I-95 opened in August 2009. In addition to rebuilding these ramps, the project will also add four ramps to service the high-occupancy toll lanes being added to I-95.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the city}} of Dubai, Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Road {{used to be known}} as the most {{dangerous}} road in the UAE, with 19 fatalities recorded on it within the first six months of 2006. But with improved road designs and replacement of several roundabouts with <b>interchanges,</b> <b>flyovers,</b> speed cameras and increase in lanes, it has become much safer to drive. This road is also used to commute from Jebel Ali area in Dubai to the old town of Dubai such as Bur Dubai and Deira. Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Road is located in the east of Dubai, parallel to Sheikh Zayed Road (E11). People also use the Sheikh Mohammad Bin Zayed Road as an alternative to the Sheik Zayed Road which has toll gates (SALIK) that deduct AED 4 every time a vehicle passes beneath them.|$|R
5|$|I-695 turns south past MD 43 and {{interchanges}} with US 1 (Belair Road) {{south of}} White Marsh. The road continues southeast to an interchange with I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway) {{a short distance}} after US 1 in Rossville. This interchange with I-95 (to east of Baltimore city) is a fully directional interchange where the carriageways of both routes crossed over each other onto the opposite side, then crossed over each other again; {{at the site of}} each crossover, left-hand entrance and exit ramps were provided to eliminate the need for directional <b>flyovers.</b> In 2008, <b>interchange</b> reconstruction at the I-95 interchange removed the left-hand entrance from northbound I-95 to westbound I-695 with the remaining left-hand entrances to be removed by August 2009 as part of the construction of the I-95 Express Toll Lane Project; all exits and entrances were now on the right, and I-95's opposing roadways no longer crossed each other (but I-695's still did).|$|R
50|$|The John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway {{portion of}} I-95, a toll {{facility}} {{operated by the}} Maryland Transportation Authority (MTA), begins {{at the end of}} the Harbor Tunnel Thruway (I-895) (also operated by MTA) at the Baltimore city line. Starting out eight lanes wide at the junction with I-895, after three miles (3 km), I-95 once again intersects with Interstate 695 at what was a unique double-crossover interchange. Within this interchange, the carriageways of I-95 narrowed to six lanes and crossed over each over, thereby putting through traffic on the left within the interchange nexus, allowing left exit ramps and left entrance ramps to accommodate four of the eight movements in lieu of <b>flyovers.</b> Beyond the <b>interchange,</b> both sets of carriageways crossed over each other again and resumed right-hand running. As part of the upgrades to Interstate 95 to accommodate express toll lanes in this area, this interchange was replaced with a more conventional four-level stack; all exits are now on the right, and I-95's carriageways no longer cross over one another.|$|R
30|$|The generic {{solution}} to compute shortest-path distances between two objects (i.e., a fast-food outlet and another outlet or school) is typically the Bellman–Ford algorithm those time complexity is O(mn). In networks exhibiting desirable properties, more specific solutions can be identified. In our network, edges have a strictly positive weight, representing {{the length of}} the corresponding road segment. In this situation, Dijkstra’s algorithm is faster due to a time complexity of O(m+n n). While there exists an optimal O(n) algorithm for planar networks [45] (i.e. which can be drawn without two overlapping edges), the British road network does not satisfy this constraint due to the presence of overpasses (called <b>flyover)</b> including stack <b>interchanges</b> (when roads are above each other on multiple levels). We note that this problem does not affect all LADs: as of 2017, [URL] estimated that there were less than 30 stack interchanges in the UK. Computations may thus be optimized by processing planar LADs differently than non-planar ones. However, to run distributed computations on the HPC facility, we ensured that the same version of the code was used for all inputs. Consequently, we implemented Dijkstra’s algorithm, and results were computed within approximately 42  hours.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{economic}} growth in Thailand has spread from the metropolitan area to other region of the country. This {{has led to the}} development of regional highway to serve as the connection link between the main port city, Bangkok and other part of the country. However, the project did not foresee the population growth situated along the highway. New dwellings on roadside are common throughout the highway. This increase demand for accessibility to the highway results in disruption of the main traffic flow by the local traffic. Thus these communities have contributed to the traffic problem on the highway. One of the most severe situations occurs on regional highway route no. 4. The link acts as a feeder from the metropolitan area to the southern region. The traffic composition on route 4 comprises of private vehicles such as cars and motorcycles and commercial vehicles such as buses and trucks. This study chosen a critical segment on route 4 where congestion problem has been escalating and potential crisis seems certain. The road section for investigation comprises of 3 lanes highway and 2 lanes frontage road (one way). This section has 2 traffic lights locate less than 2 kilometers apart and 2 hyper markets situated along the roadside. The congestion is mainly the result from the traffic light pile-up, mix traffic (local traffic) and at grade U-turns. Two design alternatives are proposed; <b>flyover</b> and compact <b>interchange</b> scenario. New design alternatives are simulated in the micro traffic simulation software, S-Paramics. The future demand of the year 2014 and 2019 are simulated in the new scenarios as well as the existing one (do nothing scenario). The highway efficiency improvement is evaluated by comparing the following measure of performances: speed, travel time and queue length with the do nothing scenario. Both alternatives solve the traffic situation by removing the traffic light from the main road. This result in an improvement in all MOPs considered. The compact scenario proves superior to the flyover scenario. This became more apparent in the simulation for 2019 where the speed efficiency increases by 59 %, travel time decreases by 70 % and the queue length lessen by 79 %. ...|$|R
