40|$|Gradualism {{is common}} in <b>international</b> <b>{{cooperation}},</b> as states begin with limited cooperation and choose more ambitious targets slowly over time. However, most models of <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> are static and thus cannot explain gradualism. I show that when states can implement domestic reforms {{to reduce the cost}} of <b>international</b> <b>cooperation,</b> enforcement concerns prompt gradualism. First, to achieve ambitious <b>international</b> <b>cooperation,</b> states must internationally enforce costly domestic reform. Second, defection at the reform stage is particularly pernicious. When other states reform, their ability to punish the defector by suspending cooperation is reduced. States choose the extent of reform to maximize the benefits of expected <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> in the future. As collective enforcement power increases or the number of states decreases, the extent and pace of reform increase. Gradualism is also most probable in international public good provision because excludable benefits mitigate enforcement problems. enforcement, game theory, gradualism, <b>international</b> <b>cooperation...</b>|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT] Since the 1990 s, many Japanese {{universities}} have newly introduced <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> {{and the related}} subjects into the curriculum. This involves proactive values {{and a variety of}} possibilities for studying <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> at university, allowing students to acquire modern wisdom in the age of globalism. By studying <b>international</b> <b>cooperation,</b> students can also acquire contemporary skills that will be useful in the globalized world. On the other hand, teaching <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> is another issue. We still lack a stable and common methodology for teaching the subject at university. We also lack valuable information on the best practices. The purpose of this study, therefore, is to change such a chaotic situation by showing three things. First, the study clarifies how <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> is taught in high schools in Japan. Second, the study shows how the subject is taught at universities in Japan. It then categorizes the actual practices into three different approaches. Finally, the study gives an example of one of the three approaches, and reports how the author himself taught <b>international</b> <b>cooperation</b> for several years in Japan...|$|R
