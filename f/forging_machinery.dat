[...] In his early life Field worked at <b>forging</b> <b>machinery.</b> He served in the U.S. military during the War of 1812 in a New London, Connecticut company.|$|E
5000|$|Henry Wehrhahn, {{employee}} of Nellie Bly’s Iron Clad Manufacturing Company of New York, received two patents in December 1905 {{that would lead}} to the modern 55-gallon steel barrel. Use of 200-litre drums became widespread in World War II, the first war in which trucks, cold rolled steel, stamp or pattern <b>forging</b> <b>machinery</b> and welding were widely available. They were first developed by the Axis powers (Germany and Italy), but were quickly adopted by Allies. [...] The drums helped win the Guadalcanal Campaign in the first U.S. offensive in the South Pacific Theater. The U.S. Navy could not maintain command of the sea long enough to offload aviation gasoline for aircraft ashore, so the drums were often transported to the island on fast ships, such as destroyers, and shoved over the sides (or, time permitting, lowered in cargo nets). Because gasoline's density is much less than that of water, the drums floated. Navy Seabees in small craft corralled the drums.|$|E

50|$|The {{sister of}} the second Queen Bee, Beatriz was {{introduced}} in JLA: Incarnations #6 (December 2001, but set around 1996) as the new ruler of Bialya. She is using humans <b>forged</b> with <b>machinery</b> and passed off as the robot Extremists to police her country. Her fate since Captain Atom's Extreme Justice team brought an end to these activities is unknown, but she was presumably toppled from power as she no longer rules Bialya.|$|R
60|$|It {{was simply}} a roof upheld by rude {{uprights}} and crossbeams, {{and open to the}} breeze that swept through it. At one end was a small blacksmith's <b>forge,</b> some <b>machinery,</b> and what appeared {{to be part of a}} small steam-engine. Midway of the shed was a closet or cupboard fastened with a large padlock. Occupying its whole length on the other side was a work-bench, and at the further end stood the workman she had heard.|$|R

50|$|Kolzam {{was part}} of the Zakłady Naprawcze Taboru Kolejowego, which was a network of railway {{factories}} in Poland, which was based close by to the Racibórz railway station in 1858. From 1895 the factory was taken over by the Directory of Railway in Katowice. After the Second World War, the company introduced sheet metal, <b>forging,</b> welding and <b>machinery</b> repair to their products. In 1973 the company introduced machinery for railways and rolling stock, and in 1984 the company had produced mini buses and railcars. The products have been exported across Europe and Asia.|$|R
50|$|The {{production}} of swords {{came to an}} end when the company's sword factory at Acton closed in September 2005. Wilkinson Sword then held an auction of the tools, equipment, sword drawings, and <b>forging</b> and milling <b>machinery.</b> Robert Pooley, who had commissioned the company to produce swords, bought many of these items and began supplying the Army in place of Wikinson Sword. Other sword manufacturers, and in particular WKC in Germany, also bought items, including the roll forge. Many of the tools and machines are still in use today and classic knives such as the Fairbairn-Sykes produced by the company.|$|R

40|$|Plants display {{an amazing}} {{developmental}} plasticity which compensates for a sessile lifestyle and inability {{to move away}} from unfavorable conditions {{as in the case of}} animals. Many aspects of this adaptability inflict changing of cell fate, de novo organ formation, and rearrangement of the plant body plan. Coordination of those processes is facilitated by the hormone auxin, which through its directional flow and local accumulation patterns provides the spatial information linking cellular and developmental modifications. This tight control of auxin distribution is in a major extent facilitated by the activity of PIN-FORMED (PIN) auxin transporters mediating export of auxin from cells. Members of the PIN protein family can display polar localization at the plasma membrane which enables the directional auxin transit through cells. The local levels of PINs in the membrane are dynamically, controlled by subcellular vesicular trafficking events encompassing secretion, recycling, degradation, and most prominently endocytosis. This well-characterized process also provides entry points for different signals that engage the endocytic <b>machinery</b> <b>forging</b> PINs into different downstream trafficking pathways, in accordance with ontogenetic programs and environmental stimuli, thus facilitating plant development...|$|R
40|$|How {{important}} {{will the}} information economy—the sectors and industries that have extremely rapid productivity growth {{driven by the}} enormous and ongoing technological revolutions in data processing and data communications—turn out to be? Will this wave of innovation and technological development have consequences similar to the trio of steam power, metal <b>forging,</b> and automatic <b>machinery</b> that powered the original British Industrial Revolution and transformed economies and societies beyond recognition? Or will it {{turn out to have}} a much smaller impact on long-run economic growth, as did previous leading sectors like civil aviation, illumination, and chemical engineering—leading sectors that produced astonishing leaps in productivity in their relatively narrow sectors, but that had little long-run influence on the structure {{of the rest of the}} economy or the rate of overall productivity growth? The analytics of the effect of a leading sector on overall productivity growth are simple and straightforward. If total factor productivity growth in the rest of the economy is growing at a rate piR, and if total factor productivity in the leading industries and sectors is growing at a faster rate piL, then total factor productivity growth in the economy as...|$|R
