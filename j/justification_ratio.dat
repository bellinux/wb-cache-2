40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{an important}} issue of the meaning ascribed to the state’s neutrality principle. The author aims at defining the adequate formula of state’s neutrality principle, starting with the most significant objection that is raised against the principle (named by the author as “skeptic’s charge”). The purpose of the paper is elaborating a formula of state’s neutrality that is resistant to skeptical charge. The author analyzes possible elements of the conception of neutrality by indicating three different questions concerning: (1) {{the character of the}} principle, (2) its <b>justification</b> (<b>ratio)</b> and (3) its object. In the concluding part he elaborates the formula of soft state’s neutrality which is, according to him, theoretically well-grounded as well as functional and useful in practical discourses (especially in legal discourse) ...|$|E

40|$|Subcompositional {{coherence}} is {{a fundamental}} property of Aitchison’s approach to compositional data analysis, and is the principal <b>justification</b> for using <b>ratios</b> of components. For dimension reduction of a matrix of compositional data, either an unweighted (Aitchison & Greenacre 2002) or weighted (Greenacre & Lewi 2009; Greenacre 2010 a: chapter 7) form of log-ratio analysis can be used, and these are both subcompositionally coherent. Many alternative methods that might be applied to compositional data are subcompositionally incoherent, but some can be judged to be less incoherent than others. In other words, either for a particular data set, or in general, a method might actually be quite subcompositionally “robust” in that its results for a subcomposition are quite close to its results for the same components {{as part of a}} full composition. So we propose that lack of subcompositional coherence, that is subcompositional incoherence, can be measured in an attempt to evaluate whether any given technique is close enough, for all practical purposes, to being subcompositionally coherent. This opens up the field to alternative methods, which might be better suited to cope with problems such as data zeros and outliers, while being only slightly incoheren...|$|R

The closeness of these two matrices can be quantified using a stress measure that is common in multidimensional scaling, providing a measure of subcompositional incoherence.
