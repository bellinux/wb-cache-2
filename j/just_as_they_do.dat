5|$|The energy {{provided}} by tidal flexing drives active geological processes within Europa's interior, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> {{to a far}} more obvious degree on its sister moon Io. Although Europa, like the Earth, may possess an internal energy source from radioactive decay, the energy generated by tidal flexing would be several orders of magnitude greater than any radiological source. Life on Europa could exist clustered around hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor, or below the ocean floor, where endoliths are known to inhabit on Earth. Alternatively, it could exist clinging to the lower surface of Europa's ice layer, much like algae and bacteria in Earth's polar regions, or float freely in Europa's ocean. If Europa's ocean is too cold, biological processes similar to those known on Earth could not take place. If it is too salty, only extreme halophiles could survive in that environment. In 2010, a model proposed by Richard Greenberg of the University of Arizona proposed that irradiation of ice on Europa's surface could saturate its crust with oxygen and peroxide, which could then be transported via tectonic processes into the interior ocean. Such a process could render Europa's ocean as oxygenated as our own within just 12 million years, allowing {{for the existence of}} complex, multicellular lifeforms.|$|E

25|$|Descriptive {{notation}} was {{usual in}} the Middle Ages in Europe. However, {{a form of}} algebraic chess notation, {{that seems to have}} been borrowed from Muslim chess, appeared in Europe in a 12th Century manuscript, referred to as MS. Paris Fr. 1173 (PP.). The files run from a to h, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> in the current standard algebraic notation. The ranks however are also designated by letters, {{with the exception of the}} 8th rank which is distinct because it has no letter. The ranks are lettered in reverse - from the 7th to the 1st: k, l, m, n, o, p, q.|$|E

2500|$|Daily {{cleaning}} of dentures is recommended. Plaque and tartar can build up on false teeth, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> on natural teeth. [...] Cleaning {{can be done}} using chemical or mechanical denture cleaners. Dentures should not be worn continuously, but rather {{left out of the}} mouth during sleep. This is to give the tissues a chance to recover, and wearing dentures at night is likened to sleeping in shoes. The main risk is development of fungal infection, especially denture-related stomatitis.|$|E

2500|$|US equities, {{corporate}} and municipal bonds can be issued in certificated form, though this practice {{has been largely}} replaced due to the costs and inefficiencies of keeping them. Rather holdings are kept as [...] "immobilized" [...] or [...] "street name", with the beneficial owners keeping them in accounts at broker-dealers and banks, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> for currencies. DTCC uses a nominee firm, Cede & Co., in whose name a share certificate is held in the DTCC vaults. Each day DTCC reconciles with the relevant transfer agent the number of shares held in its accounts for its member banks and broker-dealers. In turn, other banks and broker-dealers hold accounts with DTCC member firms, creating a chain of ownership down to the beneficial owner.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{personal}} computing era, {{one source of}} consumer confusion is {{the difference in the}} way many operating systems display hard drive sizes, compared to the way hard drive manufacturers describe them. Hard drives are specified and sold using [...] "GB" [...] and [...] "TB" [...] in their decimal meaning: one billion and one trillion bytes. Many operating systems and other software, however, display hard drive and file sizes using [...] "MB", [...] "GB" [...] or other SI-looking prefixes in their binary sense, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>they</b> <b>do</b> for displays of RAM capacity. For example, many such systems display a hard drive marketed as [...] "160GB" [...] as [...] "149.05GB". The earliest known presentation of hard disk drive capacity by an operating system using [...] "KB" [...] or [...] "MB" [...] in a binary sense is 1984; earlier operating systems generally presented the hard disk drive capacity as an exact number of bytes, with no prefix of any sort, for example, in the output of the MS-DOS or PCDOS CHKDSK command.|$|E
