40|$|The <b>internal</b> <b>photoeffect</b> in polythiopentacene (PTP) films is investigated. It is {{discovered}} that, in capacitor cells, the spectral {{dependence of the}} frontal photo-emf Vf correlates with the PTP absorption spectrum, while that of the back photo-emf Vb anticorrelates with it. The polarities of Vf and Vb coincide. In this case, the charge of the free PTP surface is negative, whereas that of the frontal SnO 2 electrode is positive. Back low- and strong-absorption illuminations photogenerate holes that diffuse to the free PTP surface and decrease Vdf. These illuminations change the polarity of Vb. The spectra of the density of short-circuit current Jsc of the sandwich cells SnO 2 PTPAg and Vb correlate. Under the modulated illumination of these cells through the SnO 2 and Ag electrodes, the drift flow of nonequilibrium holes in the electric field, conditioned by the antiblocking bending of the PTP bands near these electrodes, prevails.

The creation of photodetectors for the visible and UV radiations on the base of the materials investigated is also the aim of the paper. The model consideration of the shock ionization in amorphous semiconductors, consideration describing the variation of the quantum output spectral dependence, has been suggested. The photoconductivity growth in the materials investigated in the spectrum UV-part, growth conditioned by the shock ionization, has been detected. Thresholds of the increase of the quantum output and energies of the electron-hole pair formation have been determined experimentally. The shift of quantum output parameters from the degree of the amorphous net structure disordering, from a temperature has been detected. Effective photoreceivers for the visible and UV radiations have been created on the base of structures with Shottki's barrier. The paper results may find their field of application in sensors of UV-radiation, in physics of semiconductorsAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|This work {{reports on}} the {{fabrication}} and characterization of ultrafast vertical metal-silicon-metal (MSM) Schottky-barrier-photodiodes {{for the detection of}} visible and infrared light. The devices are manufactured on an epitaxial buried CoSi_ 2 ground plate on silicon consisting of a high quality single crystalline silicon layer sandwiched between the buried CoSi_ 2 layer and a top semitransparent metal layer. For wavelengths shorter than 1. 1 #mu#m, electron-hole pairs are generated in the Si. They are separated by an internal electrical field and accelerated towards the metal electrodes. For shorter wavelengths, Si becomes transparent and carriers are emitted from the internal semiconductor-metal interface. A photocurrent is produced. This so-called <b>internal</b> <b>photoeffect</b> is governed by different carrier dynamics: hot electrons or holes are injected from the metal layers into the silicon. Their large excess energy leads to extremely fast electrical pulses. A new theoretical model for the hot carrier dynamics inside the detector is proposed and examined by detailed simulations. The resulting temporal response of the detectors was measured with a new setup, using a modelocked Ti:sapphire laser and an optical parametric oscillator, which generates ultrafast optical pulses (170 fs) at IR wavelengths. At 820 nm the MSM photodiodes show an impulse response as short as 3. 5 ps FWHM for Si(100) and 6. 7 ps FWHM for Si(111). For the first time, the temporal response of MSM photodiodes was investigated at 1250 and 1560 nm wavelengths with femtosecond resolution. MSM photodiodes with different top metallization (Cr,Ti and Pt) were analyzed. (orig.) 71 refs.
