500|$|Hamlin, who led {{the most}} laps, {{described}} his frustration: [...] "The strategy and what-not at the end just didn't work our way. That's all I can ask for, {{is to have the}} better car than those two guys – and we did. But, unfortunately, the strategy bit us. We're <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to go there and do it the old-fashioned way next week and try to beat them on the race track." [...] Afterward, Newman, who finished second, commented, [...] "We were saving fuel the whole time. Made more sense to save fuel. We were two laps short. We just did what I thought we needed to do. If Carl made it, Carl made it." [...] Fifth place finisher Johnson described his happiness by saying: [...] "We're going to go home and we're going to make sure we have the best engines, go through our simulation stuff, make sure our car is as fast as it can be and then race. We were in a good situation and could take the risk, take the chance. It worked out for us.|$|E
500|$|Cosmopolitan {{journalist}} Alex Rees noted how it {{was normal}} for the singer to sound [...] "breathy" [...] and [...] "breathless" [...] following four songs in a row on the album discussing sex. Nicole James of Fuse called the song a [...] "sexed-up midtempo banger". Jem Aswad of the same publication noted {{the presence of a}} [...] "wild, jazzy, Joni-ish melody that flies all over the scale". Jordan Runtagh from the website VH1 called [...] "No Angel" [...] a [...] "classic fake-out love song" [...] and connected to the singer's real-life relationship with husband Jay-Z. A more mixed review came from Ryan E.C. Hamm from Under the Radar who noted that the experimentalistic songs on Beyoncé which do not work well, managed to look better only because of the record itself; he examplified this with [...] "No Angel", criticizing it as [...] "a little boring". Both Christopher R. Weingarten of Spin and Tom Breihan of Stereogum called the song [...] "boring"; the latter added it would be that way for listeners [...] "until that subtle digital bassline finds its way into your head". Breihan, however, praised the singer's falsetto vocals as [...] "a thing to behold". Melissa Locker of Time magazine stated that the singer sang [...] "slightly obnoxiously" [...] in [...] "No Angel". Una Mullally from The Irish Times questioned how [...] "No Angel" [...] was included in the track listing of Beyoncé, before adding [...] "but it did and we're <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to deal with it". However, she concluded that the song should be listened several more times to be understood.|$|E

2500|$|Mattis {{believes}} that Iran {{is the principal}} threat to {{the stability of the}} Middle East, ahead of Al-Qaeda and ISIS. Mattis says: [...] "I consider ISIS nothing more than an excuse for Iran to continue its mischief. Iran is not an enemy of ISIS. They have a lot to gain from the turmoil in the region that ISIS creates." [...] On the Iran nuclear deal, although he sees it as a poor agreement, he believes there is now no way to tear it up, saying: [...] "We are <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> to recognize that we have an imperfect arms control agreement. Second, that what we achieved is a nuclear pause, not a nuclear halt". Mattis argues that the nuclear inspections may fail to prevent Iran from seeking to develop nuclear weapons, but that [...] "f nothing else at least we will have better targeting data if it comes to a fight in the future." ...|$|E

5000|$|The menu at Moto changes frequently. [...] A typical ten- to twenty-course tasting menu at Moto {{begins with}} an edible menu. Often, guests will be {{encouraged}} to crunch the menu itself up and add it to a bowl of gazpacho to create [...] "alphabet soup." [...] One of the restaurant's hallmarks {{is the use of}} edible paper. The soy- and cornstarch-based parchment with vegetable juice as ink is typically used in two to three courses each night. Often an edible photograph accompanies a dish, such as a photo of a cow flavored to taste like filet mignon.
