2500|$|The term [...] "waiver" [...] {{is used to}} {{describe}} these programs as they waive traditional Medicaid statutory requirements regarding the setting in which long-term care services are provided. [...] The enactment of these waiver programs ushered in a major paradigm shift for the long-term care industry and the individuals served by these programs. The goal of waivers {{is to improve the}} quality of life of those receiving long-term care. The mission of such waivers is [...] "to live in the most integrated community setting appropriate to <b>individual</b> <b>support</b> requirements and preferences." [...] Since enactment, many individuals living in institutional settings have transitioned back into the community. Today, HCBS programs represent the preferred method of services delivery rather than institutionalization.|$|E

2500|$|Wireless proved {{essential}} to German {{success in the}} battle. German tanks had radio receivers {{that allowed them to}} be directed by platoon command tanks, which had voice communication with other units. Wireless allowed tactical control and far quicker improvisation than the opponent. Some commanders regarded the ability to communicate to be the primary method of combat and radio drills were considered to be more important than gunnery. Radio allowed German commanders to co-ordinate their formations, bringing them together for a mass firepower effect in attack or defence. The French advantage in numbers and equipment, which was often deployed in [...] "penny-packets" [...] (dispersed as <b>individual</b> <b>support</b> weapons) was offset. Most French tanks also lacked radio, orders between infantry units were typically passed by telephone or verbally.|$|E

Hagan, {{who is a member of}} the Presbyterian Church and a former Sunday school teacher, condemned the ad as [...] "fabricated and pathetic," [...] and, according to Hagan's campaign website, a cease-and-desist letter was [...] "hand-delivered to Dole's Raleigh office and to her home at the Watergate in Washington, DC." [...] Hagan also filed a lawsuit in Wake County Superior Court accusing Dole of defamation and libel. The ad met significant criticism from some members of the public as well national media outlets. After the first ad Hagan received over 3,600 contributions, including major donors as well as <b>individual</b> <b>support</b> from a range of persons who believed in the right to participate in civil government free of religious orthodoxy requirements.
