Various initiatives are <b>in</b> <b>train</b> towards achieving this aim including the development of activities that benefit the wider community, challenge prejudice and encourage tolerance of diversity.

Out of sensitivity towards the sensibilities of the Americans, Herring left the command arrangements between Major General Stanley Savige's 3rd Division and units of the American 41st Infantry Division ambiguous. This backfired, producing acrimony between the Australian and American commanders. Herring prepared to fire Savige, but an investigation by Major General Frank Berryman determined that the dispute was not Savige's fault.|$|E
5|$|Herbals {{contributed to}} botany by setting <b>in</b> <b>train</b> {{the science of}} plant description, classification, and botanical illustration. Up to the 17th century botany and {{medicine}} were {{one and the same}} but those books emphasising medicinal aspects eventually omitted the plant lore to become modern pharmacopoeias; those that omitted the medicine became more botanical and evolved into the modern compilations of plant descriptions we call Floras. These were often backed by specimens deposited in a herbarium which was a collection of dried plants that verified the plant descriptions given in the Floras. The transition from herbal to Flora marked the final separation of botany from medicine.|$|E

40|$|Under the Direction of Takoi Hamrita) To {{understand}} {{the relationships among}} ambient temperature (AT), relative humidity (RH) and broiler deep body temperature (DBT), controlled experiments were conducted for different RH (50 and 80 %) and AT (31, 34 and 37 o C) combinations. The DBT measurements were collected by a radio biotelemetry system. Three types of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) models {{have been developed to}} predict broiler’s DBT. Type I models predict DBT responses of birds not used <b>in</b> <b>training</b> to AT×RH combinations used <b>in</b> <b>training.</b> Type II models predict DBT responses of birds used <b>in</b> <b>training</b> to AT×RH combinations not used <b>in</b> <b>training.</b> Type III models predict DBT response of birds not used <b>in</b> <b>training</b> to AT×RH combinations not used <b>in</b> <b>training.</b> These models capture the complex relationship among DBT, AT and RH very well. They could be applied in the future in the development of environmental control system for poultry housing. INDEX WORDS...|$|R

Multiple plates could be stacked for greater performance. This design was easier to mass-produce.|$|E

50|$|Originally, {{training}} on the George Stage was restricted to the sailors <b>in</b> <b>training</b> aboard program {{so they could be}} <b>trained</b> <b>in</b> basic sailor and seamanship skills then muster with commercial vessels. The last year that there were 80 sailors aboard <b>in</b> <b>training</b> was <b>in</b> 1973. Since 1974 the ship serves 63 total program members each tour that also includes a chefs <b>in</b> <b>training</b> program, and a 10-person regular crew. The sailors and chefs <b>in</b> <b>training</b> participants must be between 17.5 and 22 years of age. Since 1981, females may also apply for the program. Since 2004 the Royal Danish Naval Academy aspirants have been <b>trained</b> aboard <b>in</b> basic seamanship; following the program completion the aspirants become cadets.|$|R

40|$|Several studies {{document}} {{the fact that}} low-educated workers participate less often <b>in</b> further <b>training</b> than high-educated workers. The economic literature {{suggests that there is}} no significant difference in employer willingness to train low-educated workers, which leaves the question of why the low educated invest less <b>in</b> <b>training</b> unanswered. This paper investigates two possible explanations: Low-educated workers invest less <b>in</b> <b>training</b> because of 1) the lower economic returns to these investments or 2) their lower willingness to participate <b>in</b> <b>training.</b> Controlling for unobserved heterogeneity that can affect the probability of enrolling into training, we find that the economic returns to training for low-educated workers are positive and not significantly different from those for high-educated workers. However, loweducated workers are significantly less willing to participate <b>in</b> <b>training.</b> This lesser willingness to participate <b>in</b> <b>training</b> is driven by economic preferences (future orientation, preference for leisure), as well as personality traits (locus of control, exam anxiety, and openness to experience) ...|$|R
25|$|Education held special {{significance}} for a socialist of Wilson's generation, {{in view of}} its role in both opening up opportunities for children from working-class backgrounds and enabling Britain to seize {{the potential benefits of}} scientific advances.

Wilson continued the rapid creation of new universities, in line with the recommendations of the Robbins Report, a bipartisan policy already <b>in</b> <b>train</b> when Labour took power.|$|E

25|$|The {{earliest}} type of toilet, {{the valve}} closet is now rarely used for water-flush toilet systems.

This design is also used <b>in</b> <b>train</b> carriages for use in areas where the waste is allowed to be simply dumped between the tracks (the flushing of such toilets is generally prohibited when the train is in a station).|$|E
