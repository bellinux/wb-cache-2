The development of the earliest computers incorporated electric typewriter keyboards: the development of the ENIAC computer incorporated a keypunch device as both the input and paper-based output device, while the BINAC computer also made use of an electromechanically controlled typewriter for both <b>data</b> <b>entry</b> onto magnetic tape (instead of paper) and data output.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{problem of}} resolving genotypes into haplotypes, under the perfect {{phylogeny}} model, {{has been under}} intensive study recently.

We define a biologically motivated probabilistic model for genotype generation and for the way missing data occur. Under this model, we provide an algorithm, which takes an expected polynomial time.

25|$|Shorthand {{was used}} more widely in the past, before the {{invention}} of recording and dictation machines. Shorthand was considered {{an essential part of}} secretarial training and police work, as well as useful for journalists. Although the primary use of shorthand has been to record oral dictation or discourse, some systems are used for compact expression. For example, healthcare professionals may use shorthand notes in medical charts and correspondence. Shorthand notes are typically temporary, intended either for immediate use or for later typing, <b>data</b> <b>entry,</b> or (mainly historically) transcription to longhand, although longer term uses do exist, such as encipherment: diaries (like that of the famous Samuel Pepys) being a common example.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Gene {{expression}} microarray {{technology has}} en-abled advanced biological and medical research, but {{the data are}} well-recognized noisy and must be used with caution, since they are greatly affected by many experimental factors such as RNA concentration, spot typing, hybridization condition, and image analysis. It is highly desirable that the inaccurate <b>data</b> <b>entries</b> (“stains”) can be identified and subsequently curated. In this paper, we propose a novel computational method, based on feature gene selection and sample classification, to efficiently discover the stains and apply imputation methods to estimate their values. Extensive experimental results on three Affymetrix platforms for human cancer diagnosis showed that by picking only 1 – 4 % <b>data</b> <b>entries</b> as the most likely stains, the smoothed datasets {{could be used for}} better downstream data analyses such as robust biomarker identification and disease diagnosis.

25|$|Even before 1 January 2000 arrived, {{there were}} also some worries about 9 September 1999 (albeit less than those {{generated}} by Y2K). Because this date could also be written in the numeric format 9/9/99, it could have conflicted with the date value 9999, frequently used to specify an unknown date. It was thus possible that database programs might act on the records containing unknown dates on that day. <b>Data</b> <b>entry</b> operators commonly entered 9999 into required fields for an unknown future date, (e.g., a termination date for cable television or telephone service), in order to process computer forms using CICS software. Somewhat similar to this is the end-of-file code 9999, used in older programming languages. While fears arose that some programs might unexpectedly terminate on that date, the bug {{was more likely to}} confuse computer operators than machines.|$|E

40|$|The {{variability}} of toxicity data contained within databases was investigated using the widely used US EPA ECOTOX database as an example. Fish acute lethality (LC 50) values for 44 compounds (for {{which at least}} 10 <b>data</b> <b>entries</b> existed) were extracted from the ECOTOX database yielding a total of 4654 test records. Significant {{variability of}} LC 50 test results was observed, exceeding several orders of magnitude. In an attempt to systematically explore potential causes of the data variability, the influence of biological factors (such as test species or life stages) and physical factors (such as water temperature, pH or water hardness) were examined. Even after eliminating the influence of these inherent factors, considerable data variability remained, suggesting an important role of factors relating to technical and measurement procedures. The analysis, however, was limited by pronounced gaps in the test documentation. Of the 4654 extracted test reports, 66. 5 % provided no information on the fish life stage used for testing. Likewise, water temperature, hardness or pH were not recorded in 19. 6 %, 48. 2 % and 41. 2 % of the <b>data</b> <b>entries,</b> respectively. From these findings, we recommend the rigorous control of <b>data</b> <b>entries</b> ensuring complete recording of testing conditions. A more consistent database will help to better discriminate between technical and natural variability of the test data, which is of importance in ecological risk assessment for extrapolation from laboratory tests to the field, and also might help to develop correction factors that account for systematic differences in test results caused by species, life stage or test conditions...|$|R
