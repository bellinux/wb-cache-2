ShoryginNanosecond {{transient}} resonance Raman {{spectra of}} the T 1 states and Raman spectra of the So states of nine <b>halogenated</b> <b>biphenyl</b> compounds were obtained and ab initio computations {{were performed to}} determine the optimized geometry and vibrational wavenumbers of the T 1 and S 0 states of 10 <b>halogenated</b> <b>biphenyl</b> compounds. Substitution of halogen atoms at meta or para positions relative to the interring C - C bond leads to little change {{in the structure of}} the <b>halogenated</b> <b>biphenyl</b> compounds relative to the corresponding So and T 1 states of biphenyl. Substitution of halogen atoms at ortho positions results in significant increases in the twisting between the two phenyl rings of the So and T 1 states of the <b>halogenated</b> <b>biphenyl</b> compounds relative to the So and T 1 states of biphenyl. The degree of twisting between the two phenyl rings in ortho-substituted halogenated biphenyls appears to depend on the steric, electronegativity and/or polarizability properties of the halogen atom. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|We report density {{functional}} theory calculations {{to obtain}} the optimized structures for the ground state neutral molecule and radical cations for twelve substituted biphenyl compounds. We have also obtained experimental Raman spectra of the ground state neutral molecule and radical cations for several substituted biphenyl compounds. We investigate how the type of halogen atom (fluoro, chloro, or bromo) and its substitution position influences the structure and properties of the radical cations of <b>halogenated</b> <b>biphenyl</b> compounds. All of the <b>halogenated</b> <b>biphenyl</b> compounds have non-planar radical cations with the degree of planarity increasing for ortho substituted halobiphenyls compared to meta and para substitution due mainly to steric interactions. Multiple ortho substitution increases the degree of non-planarity of the radical cation. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Because <b>halogenated</b> <b>biphenyl</b> {{exposure}} is suspected to disrupt endocrine function, we assessed time to menopause in women aged 24 {{years and older}} who were exposed orally to polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) (n = 874). We also examined smoking in relation to menopause. Methods: To define menopausal status, women were interviewed in 1997 and asked whether they had had any menstrual periods in the previous year, why their menstrual periods had stopped (e. g. surgery), and age at their last menstrual period. Serum PBB and PCB taken at enrollment (1976 – 1978) into the Michigan PBB registry {{was used as the}} measure of <b>halogenated</b> <b>biphenyl</b> exposure. Women whose menopause occurred before their PBB exposure were excluded. Proportional hazard modeling was used to analyze the “risk ” for menopause in relation to exposure. Premenopausal women contributed person-time until their interview date, at which time they were censored. Results: We did not find an association between either PBB or PCB exposure and time to menopause. Women who were current smokers had a shorter time to menopause than never smokers (menopause ratio 2. 02, 95 % C. I. 1. 21 – 3. 37). Time to menopause was shortest among women who reported started smoking when they were < 18 years of age, smoked at least 20 cigarettes per day...|$|E
40|$|Similar {{qualitative}} toxic {{effects have}} been observed in animals for a class of halogenated aromatic compounds, which include the <b>halogenated</b> <b>biphenyls,</b> naphthalenes, dibenzodioxins, and dibenzofurans. All of these compounds are lipid soluble and persist in the environment and in mammals. The polybrominated biphenyls (PBBs) are the most persistent. They are predominantly stored in fatty tissue; they pass the placenta and are excreted in milk. Some isomers of the <b>halogenated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> are more toxic than others. With some exceptions, the more toxic isomers are retained longer in tissues and are also the carcinogenic components of the mixture. Most of these chemicals seem to be promoters of carcinogenesis in animals rather than initiators. An array of toxic effects in laboratory animals has been ascribed to these compounds and numerous reviews summarizing this information are available. Less information {{is available on the}} human health effects of environmental and occupational exposure. Results of recent studies in animals to further elucidate the effects of these chemicals are presented, and results from some human studies conducted in the United States are reviewed...|$|R
40|$|From studies {{described}} in literature, {{it has become}} clear that many industrial aromatic halogenated hydrocarbons (AHHs) may pose a threat to the health of humans, particularly of those in the occupational environment. These compounds have found a broad environmental distribution and are contaminating food at low levels. The AHHs share the property of a high fat and low water solubility, a high persistancy to biodegradation and a low turnover rate. Hence, they are deposited in the body in adipose (fatty) tissue, and accumulate in the food chain (plants, fish, mammalian species). The group of AHHs (Table 1), consist of the <b>halogenated</b> benzenes, <b>halogenated</b> <b>biphenyls,</b> <b>halogenated</b> dibenzo-p-dioxins and halogenated dibenzofurans (Fig. 1) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarIn {{the frame}} of the project 'Setting {{environmental}} quality objectives', organic carbon normalized partition coefficients (KocS) describing the partitioning of organic chemicals in soils and sediments were derived for, among others, <b>halogenated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> and benzyltoluenes, chlorinated anilines and nitrobenzenes, various pesticides, phthalate esters and organotin compounds. For that purpose a literature review with respect to adsorption experiments with soils and sediments was carried out. According to the equilibrium partitioning method the KocS can be used to derive quality objectives for soils and sediments from ecotoxicologically based quality objectives for water when toxicity data for soil or sediment organisms are not available. Furthermore, the KocS can be used to harmonize quality objectives for different compartments (soil, sediment, interstitial water and surface water) ...|$|R
40|$|Unspecific peroxygenases (UPOs) are {{secreted}} fungal enzymes with promiscuity for {{oxygen transfer}} and oxidation reactions. Functionally, they represent hybrids of P 450 monooxygenases and heme peroxidases; phylogenetically {{they belong to}} the family of heme-thiolate peroxidases. Two UPOs from the basidiomycetous fungi Agrocybe aegerita (AaeUPO) and Marasmius rotula (MroUPO) converted 35 out of 40 compounds listed as EPA priority pollutants, including chlorinated benzenes and their derivatives, <b>halogenated</b> <b>biphenyl</b> ethers, nitroaromatic compounds, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and phthalic acid derivatives. These oxygenations and oxidations resulted in diverse products and—if at all—were limited for three reasons: (i) steric hindrance caused by multiple substitutions or bulkiness of the compound as such (e. g., hexachlorobenzene or large PAHs), (ii) strong inactivation of aromatic rings (e. g., nitrobenzene), and (iii) low water solubility (e. g., complex arenes). The general outcome of our study is that UPOs can be considered as extracellular counterparts of intracellular monooxygenases, both with respect to catalyzed reactions and catalytic versatility. Therefore, they should be taken into consideration as a relevant biocatalytic detoxification and biodegradation tool used by fungi when confronted with toxins, xenobiotics and pollutants in their natural environments...|$|E

Microsomes from rats treated with phenobarbital (PB) or halogenated biphenyls that exhibit PB-type activity preferentially enhanced the conversion of aflatoxin B 1 to aflatoxin Q 1. In contrast, microsomes from rats treated with 3 -methylcholanthrene (MC) or halogenated biphenyls that exhibit MC-type induction activity increased the metabolism of aflatoxin B 1 to aflatoxin M 1. The coadministration of PB and MC produced microsomes that exhibited both types of induction activity (mixed type) in catalyzing the oxidative metabolism of diverse xenobiotic agents. However, PB-plus-MC-induced hepatic microsomes from immature male Wistar rats preferentially increased the metabolism of aflatoxin B 1 to aflatoxin M 1 but did not enhance the conversion of aflatoxin B 1 to aflatoxin Q 1. Comparable results were observed with microsomes from rats pretreated with halogenated biphenyls classified as mixed-type inducers; moreover, in some cases there was a significant decrease in the conversion of aflatoxin B 1 to aflatoxin Q 1 (compared with that of controls treated with corn oil) ...|$|E

One week later, the activities of catalase, peroxisomal fatty acyl-CoA oxidase, and peroxisomal beta-oxidation as well as cytochrome P 450 4 A (CYP 4 A) protein content were determined in subcellular liver fractions. None of the peroxisomal enzyme activities were significantly increased by any of the <b>halogenated</b> <b>biphenyl</b> congeners tested.

40|$|The {{pathways}} of biotransformation of 4 -fluorobiphenyl (4 FBP) by the ectomycorrhizal fungus Tylospora fibrilosa {{and several}} other mycorrhizal fungi were investigated by using 19 F nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in combination with 14 C radioisotope-detected high-performance liquid chromatography (14 C-HPLC). Under the conditions {{used in this study}} T. fibrillosa and some other species degraded 4 FBP. 14 C-HPLC profiles indicated that there were four major biotransformation products, whereas 19 F NMR showed that there were six major fluorine-containing products. We confirmed that 4 -fluorobiphen- 4 ′-ol and 4 -fluorobiphen- 3 ′-ol were two of the major products formed, but no other products were conclusively identified. There was no evidence for the expected biotransformation pathway (namely, meta cleavage of the less halogenated ring), as none of the expected products of this route were found. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report describing intermediates formed during mycorrhizal degradation of <b>halogenated</b> <b>biphenyls...</b>|$|R
40|$|Exposure {{of humans}} and {{wildlife}} to xenobiotics, such as <b>halogenated</b> <b>biphenyls,</b> that interfere with the endogenous estrogen balance may lead to endocrine disruption. Such compounds may either mimic or block estradiol's action by agonistic or antagonistic action, respectively. They may also affect endogenous estradiol concentrations by induction or inhibition of enzymes that metabolize estradiol. In the present study, we demonstrate that estrogenic metabolites of two brominated biphenyls, 2, 2 ′-dibromobiphenyl (2, 2 ′-DBB) and 4, 4 ′-dibromobiphenyl (4, 4 ′-DBB), are formed by rat liver microsomal cytochrome P 450 (CYP) activity. Bioactivation of 2, 2 ′-DBB and 4, 4 ′-DBB yielded various mono- and dihydroxylated bromobiphenyl metabolites, which were collected by preparative HPLC and analyzed by LC/MS. Several of the metabolites bound to the estrogen receptor (ER) activated the ER and inhibited human estrogen sulfotransferase (hEST). Seven monohydroxylated metabolites were positively identified using synthetic monohydroxylated reference compounds. These synthetic monohydroxylated bromobiphenyls also bound to and activated the ER and inhibited hEST. The highest ER affinity was observed for 4 -OH- 2, 2 ′-DBB, with an E...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} Methylosinus trichosporium OB 3 b, expressing soluble methane monooxygenase, to oxidize {{a range of}} ortho- {{substituted}} biphenyls was examined to better understand how substituents affect both the rate and products of oxidation in comparison to biphenyl. Inhibition of oxidation was observed over the tested substrate range for both <b>biphenyl</b> and ortho- <b>halogenated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> (2 -chloro-, 2 -bromo-, and 2 -iodobiphenyl). No inhibition was observed during the oxidation of 2 -hydroxybiphenyl and 2 -methylbiphenyl. Analysis of the products of oxidation showed that, depending on the substituent, ring hydroxylation, substituent oxidation, and elimination pathways could occur. The type and abundance of products formed along with the relatively high kinetic isotope effect observed for deuterated vs. nondeuterated biphenyl (k h / k d = 3. 4 ± 0. 02) are consistent with mechanisms that include both hydrogen abstraction and NIH-shift pathways. Knowledge of these substituent-dependent reaction rates and mechanisms enhances {{our understanding of the}} methanotrophic aryl transformation potential and allows for better prediction of the formation of oxidized intermediates by methanotrophic bacteria...|$|R

Since a range of congeners with different biologic and toxicologic activities were selected for this study, it may be concluded that the polyhalogenated biphenyls do not induce peroxisome proliferation in the male rat, but rather certain members of this class of compounds down regulate peroxisome-associated enzymes. Since PCBs and PBBs do not increase enzyme activities and expression of proteins associated with PPARÃŽÂ±, these agents are therefore exerting their carcinogenic and promoting activities by some other mechanism...|$|E
40|$|A {{workshop}} on the Human Health Impacts of <b>Halogenated</b> <b>Biphenyls</b> and Related Compounds {{was held to}} assess the state of current research on these chemicals and to make recommendations for future studies. Participants discussed results from laboratory animal experiments on PCBs, PBBs, dioxins, and dibenzofurans which demonstrate a common mode of toxicological action while also revealing large variations in toxicological potency both within and between these chemical families. These variations demonstrate the importance of congener-specific analyses in future studies of effects of exposure to these compounds. Results from epidemiological studies of environmentally exposed adult and pediatric populations from the U. S., Japan, and Taiwan and occupationally exposed cohorts {{from around the world}} were considered. It was concluded that available evidence did not demonstrate serious adverse effects such as cancer, in exposed adult cohorts but did provide indications of possible neurobehavioral effects in children exposed in utero. In addition, workshop participants described newly developed markers of exposure and techniques for assessing endocrinological, immunological, and neurological effects and suggested these be applied to epidemiological studies of the effects of polyhalogenated compounds. Other recommendations included identification of other cohorts and development of a large registry of exposed individuals; performance of detailed studies of reproductive function and outcomes in exposed populations; and follow up of neurobehavioral effects in offspring of exposed women...|$|R

They are also used in staining and biological applications such as large intestine staining, skin staining, to color fibers, printed circuit boards, inks and also used in antiseptic preparation which is active against Gram-positive bacteria. BG will cause some degree of hypersensitivity reactions, carcinogenicity, microbial and fish toxicity [12]. TiO 2 nanoparticles has been proven to be a tremendous photocatalyst by which many organic substrates {{have been shown to be}} oxidatively degraded and undergoes complete mineralization to give much safer byproduct Carbon dioxide (CO 2) under UV exposure [13]. Typically TiO 2 nanoparticles are used and studied in the treatment of water such as textile waste water, ground water etc [14]. Numerous studies have been conducted on performance of TiO 2 nanoparticles, as they showed that relatively high surface area of catalyst per unit of reactor volume [15]. In aqueous environment, TiO 2 generates hydroxyl radicals, which endorse the oxidation of organics under UV irradiation [16]. This has been successfully engaged in the mineralization of several hazardous chemicals such as dyes, phenols, haloaromatics, <b>halogenated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> and more. In this research for the first time TiO 2 microparticles alone and TiO 2 along with dopants such as Zn and Cu microparticles are used to check the photocatalytic activity for degradation of BG under UV radiation.

Comparison with dissociative ionization mass spectra shows that {{the ratio of the}} efficiency of electron impact ionization induced fragmentation of 2 -I-BP, 2 -Br-BP, and 2 -Cl-BP amounts to approximately 1 : 0. 7 : 0. 6. Inspired by these results, self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) of the respective biphenyl- 4 -thiols, 2 -Cl-BPT, 2 -Br-BPT, 2 -I-BPT as well as BPT, were grown on a Au(111) substrate and exposed to 50 eV electrons. The effect of electron irradiation was investigated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), to determine whether the high relative DEA cross section for iodide loss from 2 -I-BPT as compared to 2 -Br-BP and 2 -Cl-BP is reflected in the cross-linking efficiency of SAMs made from these materials. Such sensitization could reduce the electron dose needed for the cross-linking process and may thus lead to a significantly faster conversion of the respective SAMs into carbon nanomembranes (CNMs) without the need for an increased current density. XPS data support the notation that DEA sensitization may be used to achieve more efficient electron-induced cross-linking of SAMs, revealing more than ten times faster cross-linking of 2 -I-BPT SAMs compared to those made from the other <b>halogenated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> or from native BPT at the same current density. Furthermore, the transfer of a freestanding membrane onto a TEM grid and the subsequent investigation by helium ion microscopy (HIM) verified the existence of a mechanically stable CNM created from 2 -I-BPT after exposure to an electron dose as low as 1. 8 mC/cm 2.
