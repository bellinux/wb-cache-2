In 2016, the Pentagon ended the policy that also barred transgender people <b>from</b> <b>serving</b> openly in the military.|$|E
5|$|Nuyts was {{released}} from captivity in 1636, most likely due {{to the efforts of}} François Caron, who knew Nuyts <b>from</b> <b>serving</b> as his interpreter during the unsuccessful Japanese embassy of 1627. On returning from Japan, Nuyts was fined by the VOC, before being dishonorably dismissed from the company and sent back to the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|The Shia {{majority}} {{ruled by}} the Sunni Al khalifa family since the eighteenth century have long complained {{of what they call}} systemic discrimination. They are blocked <b>from</b> <b>serving</b> in important political and military posts and the government has reportedly naturalized Sunnis originally from Pakistan and Syria in what Shia say is an attempt to increase the percentage of Sunnis in the population.|$|E

5|$|Although the Kentucky Constitution {{prohibited}} governors <b>from</b> <b>serving</b> consecutive terms, Beckham {{announced he}} would seek a full term as governor in 1903. His candidacy was challenged in court, but the court ruled Beckham had not served a full first term and was eligible to run. Due to his record of reconciliation and supporting non-controversial reforms, he had no significant opposition in winning his party's nomination. His record also deprived his Republican opponent, Morris B. Belknap, of any significant campaign issue in the general election. Beckham defeated Belknap and three minor candidates.|$|E
5|$|Emma Jane Catherine Cobden (28 April 1851– 7 July 1947), {{known as}} Jane Cobden, was a British Liberal {{politician}} who {{was active in}} many radical causes. A daughter of the Victorian reformer and statesman Richard Cobden, she was an early proponent of women's rights, and in 1889 {{was one of two}} women elected to the inaugural London County Council. Her election was controversial; legal challenges to her eligibility hampered and eventually prevented her <b>from</b> <b>serving</b> as a councillor.|$|E
5|$|Having {{successfully}} {{dealt with}} the major challenges and issues involved in forming a new state government, Shelby left the state safe and financially sound. Kentucky's constitution prevented a governor <b>from</b> <b>serving</b> consecutive terms, so Shelby retired to Traveler's Rest, his Lincoln County estate, {{at the conclusion of}} his term in 1796. For the next 15 years he tended to affairs on his farm. He was selected as a presidential elector in six consecutive elections, but these were his only appearances in public life during this period.|$|E

5|$|Jennings's salary as governor, {{which was}} the highest for an elected {{official}} in the state, was $1,000. Under the constitution, the governor served a three-year term and was prohibited <b>from</b> <b>serving</b> more that six years in a nine-year period. Jennings's agenda called for establishing court proceedings to secure justice, organizing a state-funded educational systems, creating a state banking system, preventing unlawful seizure and enslavement of free blacks, organizing a state library, and planning internal improvements. His efforts had limited success, due, in part, to the state's limited financial resources and Jennings's limited powers as governor.|$|E
5|$|Norway {{prohibited}} {{nuclear warheads}} {{to be stored}} on its soil, preventing Banak <b>from</b> <b>serving</b> in a role {{as a base for}} US nuclear-armed bombers. NATO's military interest for Banak peaked during the late 1960s. Increased range of Soviet aircraft during the 1970s diminished the need for troops in Finnmark; combined with Norwegian tension and nuclear policies, this caused the United States to favor Vestfjorden and Troms over Banak as the primary areas of defense.|$|E
5|$|Students {{from the}} Imperial University {{organized}} a widespread student {{protest against the}} eunuchs of Emperor Huan's court. Huan further alienated the bureaucracy when he initiated grandiose construction projects and hosted thousands of concubines in his harem {{at a time of}} economic crisis. Palace eunuchs imprisoned the official Li Ying (李膺) and his associates from the Imperial University on a dubious charge of treason. In 167 AD, the Grand Commandant Dou Wu (d.168 AD) convinced his son-in-law, Emperor Huan, to release them. However the emperor permanently barred Li Ying and his associates <b>from</b> <b>serving</b> in office, marking the beginning of the Partisan Prohibitions.|$|E

5|$|The Papuan {{campaign}} led to {{a significant}} reform {{in the composition of}} the Australian Army. During the campaign, the restriction banning CMF personnel <b>from</b> <b>serving</b> outside of Australian territory hampered military planning and caused tensions between the AIF and CMF. In late 1942 and early 1943 Curtin overcame opposition within the Labor Party to extending the geographic boundaries in which conscripts could serve to include most of the South West Pacific and the necessary legislation was passed in January 1943. The 11th Brigade was the only CMF formation to serve outside of Australian territory, however, when it formed part of Merauke Force in the NEI during 1943 and 1944.|$|E
5|$|The Swiss Armed Forces, {{including}} the Land Forces and the Air Force, are composed mostly of conscripts, male citizens aged from 20 to 34 (in special cases up to 50) years. Being a landlocked country, Switzerland has no navy; however, on lakes bordering neighbouring countries, armed military patrol boats are used. Swiss citizens are prohibited <b>from</b> <b>serving</b> in foreign armies, {{except for the}} Swiss Guards of the Vatican, or if they are dual citizens of a foreign country and reside there.|$|E
5|$|The Virginia General Assembly is {{the oldest}} {{continuous}} law-making body in the New World. The state government was ranked most effective by the Pew Center on the States in both 2005 and 2008. It is unique in how it treats cities and counties equally, manages local roads, and prohibits its governors <b>from</b> <b>serving</b> consecutive terms. Virginia's economy has many sectors: agriculture in the Shenandoah Valley; federal agencies in Northern Virginia, including {{the headquarters of the}} U.S. Department of Defense and Central Intelligence Agency (CIA); and military facilities in Hampton Roads, the site of the region's main seaport.|$|E

5|$|The first Governor of Indiana, Jonathan Jennings, {{was elected}} in August 1816 and assumed office in December of that year. The first capital was in Corydon, and the first three {{governors}} maintained homes and offices there. The capital was moved to Indianapolis in December 1824. Governors originally served three-years terms until the constitution was replaced in 1851. The 1851 constitution extended terms to four years but banned governors <b>from</b> <b>serving</b> consecutive terms. The constitution was amended again in 1972 to allow governors to serve consecutive terms but limited them to two consecutive terms at a time.|$|E

5|$|Anne is visibly upset upon {{learning}} {{that the new}} tenant of Kellynch Hall will be Admiral Croft, who is the brother-in-law of Frederick Wentworth (Ciarán Hinds)—a naval captain she was persuaded to reject in marriage nine years previously because of his lack of prospects and connections. Wentworth is now wealthy <b>from</b> <b>serving</b> in the Wars, and has returned to England, presumably to find a wife. Later, Anne expresses to Lady Russell her unhappiness at her family's current financial predicament, and her past decision to reject the captain's proposal of marriage. Anne visits her other sister Mary (Sophie Thompson), a hypochondriac who has married into a local farming family. Anne patiently listens to the various complaints confided in her by each of the Musgrove family; this includes Mary's husband Charles, sisters-in-law Louisa (Emma Roberts) and Henrietta (Victoria Hamilton), and parents-in-law Mr and Mrs Musgrove (Roger Hammond and Judy Cornwell).|$|E

5|$|During the English Civil War, {{the members}} of the Long Parliament {{realised}} that the use of county militia organised into regional associations (such as the Eastern Association), often commanded by local members of parliament (both from the House of Commons and the House of Lords), while more than able to hold their own in the regions which Parliamentarians controlled, were unlikely to win the war. So Parliament initiated two actions. The Self-denying Ordinance, with the notable exception of Oliver Cromwell, forbade members of parliament <b>from</b> <b>serving</b> as officers in the Parliamentary armies. This created a distinction between the civilians in Parliament, who tended to be Presbyterian and conciliatory to the Royalists in nature, and a corps of professional officers, who tended to Independent politics, to whom they reported. The second action was legislation {{for the creation of a}} Parliamentary-funded army, commanded by Lord General Thomas Fairfax, which became known as the New Model Army (originally new-modelled Army).|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the war, the government's immediate response was to announce on 5 September 1939 that it would begin calling up 10,000 militiamen at a time to provide sixteen days continuous service manning guard posts at selected points around the country. This was later expanded on 15 September to include all of the Militia, in two drafts of 40,000 men, for one month's continuous training, however, the suspension on compulsory training introduced in 1929 was not amended until January 1940. On 5 September 1939 it was also announced that a division would be raised for overseas service, but there was still large-scale opposition to the concept of conscription and the provisions of the Defence Act still precluded conscripts <b>from</b> <b>serving</b> outside of Australian territory, so it was announced that this force would be raised from volunteers only and would not be raised directly from the Militia. Conscripts, however, were required to serve in the Militia, with the result being that the Militia's ranks were filled with both volunteers and conscripts during this time.|$|E
5|$|From 1911 to 1941 {{women were}} {{forbidden}} <b>from</b> <b>serving</b> in the RAN; the demands World War II placed on personnel and resources {{led to a}} change of policy. On 21 April 1941, the Australian Naval Board sent a letter authorising the entry of women into the RAN to the Commodore-in-Charge, Sydney. The letter {{led to the formation}} of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service (WRANS) and the Royal Australian Naval Nursing Service (RANNS). The two separate women's services existed until 1984, when they were incorporated into the permanent force. Today, female members of the RAN have a wide variety of roles open to them; women serve on submarines, command ships and shore postings and are expected to play an increasingly important role in the future of the RAN.|$|E
