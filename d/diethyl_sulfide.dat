40|$|Odor {{problems}} in drinking water, particularly swampy/septic odors, are normally {{triggered by a}} set of organic compounds with odor threshold concentrations (OTC) ranging from ng L- 1 to mu g L- 1. With such a low level of OTC, it has long been a challenge to effectively determine the odor-causing compounds in highly complex samples. The Huangpu and Huai rivers, as source waters in south China, have exhibited continuous swampy/septic odor over the entire year, yet the corresponding odor-causing compounds remain unclear. In order to screen the odor-causing compounds in these two rivers, a method to simultaneously determine fifty-four frequently encountered compounds with categories of thioethers, aldehydes, pyrazines, benzenes and phenols, has been developed using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOFMS) based on liquid-liquid extraction. The results indicated that this method could allow the analysis of different categories of compounds without derivatization at considerably higher sensitivities. Four thioether compounds, including dimethyl disulfide, <b>diethyl</b> disulfide, propyl <b>sulfide,</b> and amyl sulfide, and one ether compound (bis(2 -chloroisopropyl) ether) were at least detected in one of the source waters with a concentration higher than their OTC value, suggesting that these compounds might be the main compounds causing the swampy/septic odor. At the same time, other compounds, including pyrazine, pyridine, 2 -methyl-phenol, 2 -nitro-phenol, and 2, 6 -dimethyl-phenol, were detected with a concentration lower than their respective OTC value. The contribution of these compounds to the swampy/septic odor requires further evaluation...|$|R

Since I2 has little tendency to undergo electrostatic bonding, the EA parameter {{was assigned a}} small value, 0.5, while the value of CA for the covalent property was set at 2.0. For the two base parameters, EB for CH3C(O)N(CH3)2 ( [...] DMA) was set at 2.35 and CB for (C2H5)2S, <b>diethyl</b> <b>sulfide,</b> was set at 3.92. Fixing the parameters in this way imposed the covalent- electrostatic model on the data set by fixing the EAEB and CACB products of the DMA and (C2H5)2S adducts with iodine, and these four values ensured {{that none of the}} parameters had negative values. Due to increasing enthalpy data that became available since the EC equation was first proposed the parameters have been improved.

Thiols are better known than selenols or tellurols. Thiols are the most stable chalcogenols and tellurols are the least stable, being unstable in heat or light. Other organic chalcogen compounds include thioethers, selenoethers and telluroethers. Some of these, such as dimethyl sulfide, <b>diethyl</b> <b>sulfide,</b> and dipropyl sulfide are commercially available. Selenoethers are {{in the form of}} R2Se or RSeR.

This {{work has been}} undertaken with the goals to understand the destruction of sulfur mustard simulants at early stages and explore routes relevant to emissions under off -design incineration modes, such as fuel rich conditions due to inhomogeneous mixing. The studies were conducted in an atmospheric pressure, turbulent flow reactor with a Reynolds number of approximately 5000, at four different operating temperatures between 630 [MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR] and 740 [MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR] These experiments, with an initial loading of the C C. simulants of 150 / 100 ppm, involved either a nitrogen carrier gas for pyrolysis experiments or a nitrogen- oxygen carrier gas (including approximately stoichiometric conditions and fuel -lean conditions with an equivalence ratio of approximately 0. 1) for oxidation experiments. On -line, extractive sampling in conjunction with analysis by fourier transform infra -red (FT -IR) spectrometry and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) was performed to quantify species composition at four specific locations along the centerline of the turbulent flow reactor. Species concentrations were represented {{as a function of}} residence time in the reactor. For the pyrolysis of <b>diethyl</b> <b>sulfide,</b> a destruction efficiency of 70 % was observed for the 740 [MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR] operating condition at a residence time of 0. 06 second. Ethyl ene, C ethane, and methane were detected at significant levels. In the oxidation experiments, the destruction of <b>diethyl</b> <b>sulfide</b> was significantly enhanced. Complete destruction was observed in the 740 [MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR] operating condition at a residence time of 0. 06 secon d C with low O 2 loading and in the 740 [MASCULINE ORDINAL INDICATOR] operating condition at a residence time of 0. 03 C second with high O 2 loading. Carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, formaldehyde as well as the pyrolysis product species, were detected in the oxidation experiments. The experimental investigations of <b>diethyl</b> <b>sulfide</b> were complemented by mechanism development along with thermochemical properties. The present model of H-C-S-O system consists of approximately 1000 elementary reactions among 300 species. Mechanism predictions reproduced the experimental results satisfactorily. Rate of production analysis under several conditions in the present work showed that the initiation of <b>diethyl</b> <b>sulfide</b> destruction is through unimolecular dissociation via C S bond cleavage. Once the radical pool is established, hydrogen abstraction becomes primary destruction routes. [beta] -scission of the derived radicals forms thioaldehydes and subsequent multi -hydrogen abstractions and [beta] -scissions convert thioaldehydes to sulfur dioxide. Sensitivity analysis indicated that the reactions, having important effects on radical pools, to which mechanism predictions are the most sensitive.

The reaction of singlet oxygen with thioanisole and <b>diethyl</b> <b>sulfide,</b> in the absence and {{in the presence of}} 1 -butyl- 3 -methylimidazolium cation, was followed along the reaction coordinate up to the formation of the persulfoxide intermediate that is widely recognized as the key intermediate in this process. In line with previous experimental observations, the results obtained show that the imidazolium cation strongly stabilizes the persulfoxide intermediate by hydrogen bonding thus depressing the unproductive intersystem crossing and favoring product formation. Evidence for a significant role played by exciplex intermediates in this reaction was also found. Surprisingly, the results for the singlet oxygen-sulfide system in the absence of imidazolium show that whereas <b>diethyl</b> <b>sulfide</b> can readily form the persulfoxide intermediate, from which S-oxidation products ensue, for thioanisole the persulfoxide formation is characterized by a high activation energy. A detailed investigation on the role played by the aromatic ring in this dramatic activation energy increase is presented suggesting, for the first time, a rationale for the well known low reactivity exhibited by aromatic sulfides in reactions with singlet oxygen.

Cells grown on an alkyl sulfide or disulfide also oxidized the corresponding thiols, namely, methanethiol, ethanethiol, propanethiol, or butanethiol.

40|$|International audienceThe {{destruction}} of stockpiles or unexploded ammunitions of bis(2 -chloroethyl) sulfide, also called mustard gas or yperite, by thermal treatments requires {{the development of}} highly safe processes. The high-level of toxicity of this compound induces {{a high level of}} complexity for any experiments. Consequently, there is a considerable lack of knowledge on the behavior of this chemical under high-temperature conditions (with or without oxygen). In this work a detailed chemical kinetic model for the combustion and pyrolysis of mustard gas is proposed for the first time. A large number of thermo-kinetic parameters were calculated using quantum chemistry and reaction rate theory. The model was validated against experimental pyrolysis data of the literature. It was shown that the degradation of mustard gas is ruled by a chain reaction mechanism where the chlorine atom is the principal chain carrier. HS radical, formed in the primary mechanism by an original pathway found using quantum calculations, was also proved to be an important chain carrier. Comparison with the kinetics of the usual simulant of mustard gas, <b>diethyl</b> <b>sulfide,</b> showed that the lack of chlorine atom in the former chemical leads to an inappropriate simulation of the mustard gas behavior.

Wide bandgap (3. 4 – 3. 9 eV) and ultrathin (3 – 5 nm) layers of CuSCN are formed when the aqueous CuSCN–ammine complex solution is spin-cast in air and annealed at 100 °C. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirms the high compositional purity of the formed CuSCN layers, while the high-resolution valence band spectra agree with first-principles calculations. Study of the hole-transport properties using field-effect transistor measurements reveals that the aqueous-processed CuSCN layers exhibit a fivefold higher hole mobility than films processed from <b>diethyl</b> <b>sulfide</b> solutions with the maximum values approaching 0. 1 cm 2 V− 1 s− 1.

The results of the research, the first Italian data-bank per variety on such volatiles, allow us to make a comparison with the data of other winegrowing areas, to investigate the aging effect on the considered volatiles, and, finally, to try a variety discrimination using statistical procedures.

Several common wine sulfur volatiles, including hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S), methanethiol (MeSH), dimethyl sulfide (DMS), dimethyl disulfide (DMDS), dimethyl trisulfide (DMTS), diethyl disulfide (DEDS), methyl thioacetate (MeSOAc), and ethyl thioacetate (EtSOAc), have been analyzed with multiple internal standards using SPME-GC equipped with pulsed-flame photometric detection (PFPD) at various concentrations of ethanol, volatile-, and non-volatile-matrix components in synthetic wine samples. All compounds exhibit a stark decrease in detectability {{with the addition of}} ethanol, especially between 0. 0 and 0. 5 %v/v, but the ratio of standard to internal standard was more stable when alcohol concentration was greater than 1 %. Addition of volatile matrix components yields a similar decrease but the standard-to-internal-standard ratio was consistent, suggesting the volatile matrix did not affect the quantification of volatile sulfur compounds in wine. Non-volatile wine matrix appears to have negligible effect on sensitivity. Based on analyte:internal standard ratios, DMS can be accurately measured against ethyl methyl sulfide (EMS), the thioacetates and DMDS with <b>diethyl</b> <b>sulfide</b> (DES), and H₂S, MeSH, DEDS, and DMTS with diisopropyl disulfide (DIDS) in wine with proper dilution.

40|$|In this paper, we give a full {{account of}} our {{studies of the}} {{dynamics}} of electron-transfer reactions. We examine bimolecular reactions of various donors and acceptors and focus on the reversible and dissociative elementary steps probed directly using femtosecond time, speed, and angular resolutions. In particular, we report studies of the bimolecular systems of the following electron donors:[*] <b>diethyl</b> <b>sulfide,</b> p-dioxane, acetone, and benzene. The electron acceptors are iodine and iodine monochloride. The general phenomena of reversible and dissociative electron transfer are found for all systems studied. The dynamics of the dative bonding, from the transition state (TS) to final products, involve two elementary processes with different reaction times, speed and angular distributions. For example, for the diethyl sulfide·iodine system, it is shown that after charge separation, the entire complex is trapped in the TS region and the reversible electron transfer occurs in less than 500 femtosecond (lifetime), followed by the rupture of the I−I bond with the release of the first exterior I-atom. However, the second process of the remaining and trapped (caged) interior I-atom takes 1. 15 ps with its speed (500 m/s) being much smaller than the first one (1030 m/s). The initial structure is determined to be a nearly linear configuration of S−I−I (165 °), consistent with the ab inito calculations and predictions of the HOMO−LUMO frontier orbitals. The observed time scales and bifurcation of the wave packet, with different speeds, are illustrated on the global potential energy surface with the help of molecular dynamics simulations. The findings on this and the other systems reported here elucidate the mechanism and address the concepts of nonconcertedness, caging, and restricted energy dissipation, which are important to the description of reaction mechanisms in the condensed phase, on surfaces, and in electrochemical studies...|$|E
40|$|Sulfur mustard (SM; 2, 2 ’-dichloro <b>diethyl</b> <b>sulfide)</b> is an alkylating {{chemical}} warfare agent and inflicts serious blisters upon contact with human skin. Monofunctional sulfur mustard, 2 -chloroethyl ethyl sulfide (CEES) {{has been used}} as a simulant for detection, mechanism of action and protection studies of SM. The objective of this study is to compare the toxicity of SM and CEES using oxidative stress markers with reference to the route specific toxicity, through percutaneous (p. c.), subcutaneous (s. c.), oral (p. o.) and intraperitoneal (i. p.) routes in mice. The LD 50 of SM was determined to be 9. 7, 13. 5, 19. 3 and 4. 8 mg/kg through p. c., s. c., p. o. and i. p. routes, respectively. Notably, SM through i. p. route was found to be the most toxic, the p. c. route was more toxic than s. c. and p. o. routes. The LD 50 of CEES was determined to be 1425, 100, 566 and 17. 7 mg/kg through p. c., s. c., p. o. and i. p. routes, respectively. In the case of CEES the s. c. route was more toxic than p. c. route, which is more typical of toxic chemicals. At 1 and 2 LD 50, death after CEES administration was within 1 to 2 days, while death following SM administration was much delayed (> 6 days). Equitoxic doses (0. 5 LD 50) of SM and CEES were administered through all the routes: and it was observed that the p. c. route showed a significant decrease in body weight in SM. Depletions in reduced and oxidized glutathione, compared to CEES, were also observed 7 days after administration. However, increases in malondialdehyde and reactive oxygen species levels were observed in both SM and CEES through all routes, 7 days after administration. DNA fragmentation was observed in SM through the i. p. route and in CEES through the p. o., i. p. and s. c. routes (also at 0. 5 LD 50 dose) ...|$|E

In each case, the first observed process was the fast substitution of <b>diethyl</b> <b>sulfide</b> by the phosphanyl group leading to the monosubstituted ring-open cis-[PtPh 2 (CO) eta(1) -P-X) ] (X = N or S) complexes, which were characterised in solution by H- 1 and P- 31 {H- 1 } NMR spectroscopy. These initially formed species undergo a slow ring closure process with extrusion of carbon monoxide and formation of the chelate [PtPh 2 (P-X) 1 products, except {{in the case of}} the short-bite Ph 2 PPy and P-CH 2 SPh ligands and of ppNMe(2), where ring closure was not observed. The chelate complexes were isolated as solids from the reaction of the ligands with cis-[PtPh 2 (Me 2 SO) (2) ], A single-crystal X-ray diffractometric study of cis-[PtPh 2 (P-SEt) J (18) was performed, The crystal packing showed linear chains originated by weak intermolecular Pt [...] . H-C hydrogen bonding interactions. The chelation kinetics of P-X in the cis-[PtPh 2 (CO) (eta(1) -P-X) ] complexes have been monitored in [D]chloroform by H- 1 and P- 31 {H- 1 } NMR, The rates of ring closure were found to be strongly dependent on the nature (S or N) and steric hindrance of the chelating end of the monocoordinated bidentate P-X ligand, and on the size of the ring formed. In contrast, ring size plays a negligible role, if any, in the dechelation reactions of cis-[PtPh 2 (S-S) ] [S-S = 1, 2 -bis(phenylthio) ethane, dpte and 1, 3 -bis (phenylthio) propane, dptp] using diphosphanes (dppm and dppp) as reagents. These kinetic data, together with those of previous work, give useful insight into the factors controlling cyclisation reactions and the stability of the rings in square planar platinum(II) complexe...|$|E
