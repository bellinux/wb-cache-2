40|$|Recently out-breaks of {{the green}} <b>oak</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> Tortrix viridana L. (Lepidoptera, Tortricidae) were {{recorded}} in Natural Reserve in Sicily (Italy) where treatments are generally forbidden. The commercial, social and environmental value of the wood in the forest needs to be preserved and biological control could be applied in particular case. To optimise the permitted biological treatment, {{not only in terms}} of product amount but also for the time of application baseline susceptibility of T. viridiana from the Natural Reserve of Ficuzza (Palermo, Italy) to a commercial formulation of Bacillus thuringiensis was determined for neonates and 2, 5, 10 and 15 day old larvae. The differences in susceptibility of the different larval development were recorded. For neonates the calculated DL 50 was 0. 63 μg/ml, while after five days it was 10. 01 μg/ml. The same doses had little effect on the older larvae, showing a clear decrease in susceptibility with age and larval growth. A relationship was also found between susceptibility and body length. The implications of these data in controlling this pest in the natural reserve are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In Western Europe {{pedunculate oak}} (Quercus robur L.) is the forest tree {{with the highest}} number of {{phytophagous}} insect species (Yela & Lawton 1997). One of these, the green <b>oak</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> Tortrix viridana L. is an oligophagous herbivorous moth with a host range limited to the genus Quercus (Hunter 1990, Du Merle 1999). During outbreaks, T. viridana often leads to defoliation of oaks in spring. The abundance of T. viridana is subject to the population size fluctuations typical for herbivorous insects, where periods of small population sizes (latent periods) alternate with periods of high population sizes (outbreak) (e. g. Schütte 1957, Horstmann 1984). Apart from many experimental studies on population dynamics of the moth (e. g. Hunter 1990, Du Merle 1999, Ivashov & al. 2002) so far little {{attention has been paid to}} the genetic variation within the species as an important aspect of the genetics of this host-parasite interaction. Simchuk & al. (1999) found changes in the heterozygosity level of different isozyme loci during outbreaks in T. viridana and molecular markers for T. viridana have been developed for analyses of genetic variation within and among populations (Schroeder & Scholz 2005). But, investigations of genetic variation within and among populations of forest pest species are important to predict future pest outbreaks. So far the processes outbreaks based on are not entirely clarified, however it is known that migration plays a major role. Using molecular markers investigations of the genetic variation are possible and offer the opportunity to analyse distribution events. In this paper first results are presented concerning the genetic variation of the green <b>oak</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> at three geographic scales: (1) among trees within a population, (2) among populations at a small spatial scale of about 150 km and (3) among populations at a broader geographic scale up to 3000 km. Furthermore results of the genetic variation of oaks at the small spatial scale are represented. Populationen des grünen Eichenwicklers (Tortrix viridana L., Lepidoptera: Tortricidae) und der Stieleiche (Quercus robur L., Fagaceae) wurden auf genetische Differenzierungen mit Hilfe von Kern-DNA-Markern untersucht. Insgesamt wurden 14 Eichenbestände in Nordrhein-Westfalen (NRW) und 7 weitere in verschiedenen Regionen Europas in die Untersuchung einbezogen. Weder für die Eiche noch für den Eichenwickler sind genetische Differenzierungen der Populationen auf einer kleinen geographischen Skala (etwa 150 km) nachweisbar, jedoch zeigen die Eichenpopulationen eine zunehmende genetische Distanz mit zunehmender geographischer Distanz. Für den Eichenwickler konnten innerhalb von Populationen in einem Radius von etwa 40 m Familienstrukturen ermittelt werden und auf einer kontinentalen Skala lassen sich die Ergebnisse für den Eichenwickler mit einer „isolation by distance“ erklären...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} pest in the Oak forest of Kurdistan province is <b>Oak</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> moth, Tortrix viridana L. (Lep. : Tortricidae). Use of pheromone trap is one of the suitable methods for monitoring and controlling of the pest. In this work, three main factors which affect the efficiency of traps including trap type, pheromone dose and installation height trap were studied. Four types of trap including cylindrical, rectangular, delta and wing trap were tested. Capture efficiency of the traps, were installed in the middle, and top heights of the trees were compared. Three doses of pheromone 0. 5, 1, and 1. 5 mgr per trap were also compared. Results showed that there were significant differences among four types of traps. Cylindrical, rectangular and delta traps caught more number of moths than wing trap (P&lt; 0. 05). There {{were no significant differences between}} two installation heights (P&gt; 0. 05). However, a significant differences was observed among three doses (P&lt; 0. 05), and the dose of 0. 5 mg caught more moths than the other three doses. Therefore cylindrical traps containing 0. 5 mg of synthetic sex pheromone installed in the middle of the trees canopy may be recommended in the management program of the pest...|$|R
40|$|The green <b>oak</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>roller,</b> Tortrix viridana L., {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} pests, causing damages to various species of oak, feeding on different host plants including Quercus infectoria Oliv, Q. branti Lindl, and Q. libani Oliv. Nutritional indices, activity of enzymatic and non-enzymatic compounds of T. viridana were studied under laboratory conditions. In addition, chemical components were analysed in the leaves of the three host plants. Fourth instar larvae reared on Q. branti showed the highest values of relative consumption rate (RCR), approximate digestibility, and consumption index (48. 73 ± 6. 22; 90. 45 ± 1. 06 and 97. 45 ± 12. 44 respectively), while the lowest values were observed on Q. libani. Efficiency of conversion of ingested food in the fourth instar larvae was the highest (3. 17 ± 0. 661) on Q. libani and the lowest (1. 53 ± 0. 164) on Q. branti. The fifth instar larvae fed on Q. libani had the highest RCR (15. 64 ± 2. 51). The highest amounts of triglycerides, uric acid, glucose, protein and the lowest activity of alkaline phosphatase were observed in the fifth instar larvae reared on Q. libani. The leaves of Q. libani highlighted the highest amounts of total nitrogen, total protein, water, potassium, magnesium and total carbohydrate. The present research suggested that the nutritional quality of the host plants have crucial effects on T. viridana larvae...|$|R
40|$|The Green <b>oak</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> Tortrix viridana {{is one of}} {{the most}} harmful pest of the Palearctic oaks. The young larvae of T. viridana develop inside the {{flushing}} buds and their egg hatch is synchronized with the bud burst of the oaks. The aim of the study was to investigate the genetic structure and variation of mitochondrial and nuclear loci in Sardinian populations associated with deciduous (Quercus pubescens) and evergreen (Q. suber and Q. ilex) oaks. We performed multilocus analyses (COI, COII mitochondrial genes and eight microsatellites) in about two hundreds individuals collected on all the three oak species coming from the most important forest districts in Sardinia Island, Italy. The populations were also characterized by egg hatching, after comparison in semi-field tests for egg development. Eighty-five mitochondrial haplotypes were found, with three ones shared among all populations, except the most southern one. A high haplotype diversity (H = 0. 90) and a low nucleotide diversity (? = 0. 003) have been observed. Microsatellites were highly variable with alleles ranging from 4 to 56 for locus and polymorfic information content values varying from 0. 510 to 0. 945. AMOVA tests were performed by structuring samples in different groups (geographic districts/oak species/egg development). The highest values of Fixation indexes resulted grouping populations according to early or late egg hatching. Furthermore, we tested for sex-biased dispersal, estimating pairwise FST, FIS, and relatedness r at nuclear loci separately for the sexes. We produced evidence for non random patterns of gene flow probably mediated by male biased dispersal, with values significantly higher in females than in males and females the phylopatric sex. In support of a male biased dispersal, nuclear and mitochondrial markers provided different results in the matter of genetic structure, with mitochondrial loci, unlike microsatellites, highlighting significant differentiation levels among populations...|$|R
