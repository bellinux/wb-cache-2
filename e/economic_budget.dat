30|$|Risk {{problems}} that are characterized by high uncertainty but low ambiguity require precaution-based management. Since sufficient scientific certainty is currently either not available or unattainable, expanded knowledge acquisition may help to reduce uncertainty and move the risk problem {{back to the first}} stage of handling complexity. If, however, uncertainty cannot be reduced by additional knowledge, risk management should foster and enhance precautionary and resilience-building strategies and decrease vulnerabilities in order to avoid irreversible effects. Appropriate instruments include containment, diversification, monitoring, and substitution. Because the focal point here is to find the adequate and fair balance between being overcautious versus being not cautious enough, a reflective processing involving stakeholders is necessary to ponder concerns, <b>economic</b> <b>budgeting,</b> and social evaluations.|$|R

40|$|Osteoporotic {{fractures}} represent one of {{the most}} common cause of disability and {{one of the}} major voice in the health <b>economic</b> <b>budget</b> in many countries of the world. Fragility fractures are especially meta-epiphyseal fractures, in skeletal sites with particular biomechanic characteristic (hip, vertebrae), complex and with more fragments, with slow healing process (mineralization and remodeling) and co-morbidity. The healing of a fracture in osteoporotic bone passes through the normal stages and concludes with union of the fracture although the healing process is prolonged. Fractures in the elderly osteoporotic patients represent a challenge to the orthopaedic surgeons. Osteoporosis does not only increase the risk of fracture but also represents a problem in osteofixation of fractures in fracture treatment. The major technical problem that surgeons face, is the difficulty to obtain a stable fixation of an implant due to osteoporotic bone. The load transmitted at the bone-implant interface can often exceed the reduced strain tolerance of osteoporotic bone. In the treatment of osteoporotic fractures it is important to consider different aspects: general conditions of elderly patient and comorbidity, the reduced muscular and bone mass and the increased bone fragility, structural modifications as medullary expansion. The aim of surgical treatment is to obtain a stable fixation that reduces pain and permits an early mobilizatio...|$|E

30|$|In {{the recent}} years, remote sensing {{techniques}} for landslide analysis {{have been interested}} by several technical and scientific improvements. These techniques {{can play an important}} role in landslide risk management, as they allow the representation of large surfaces with dense spatial sampling, offering clear advantages with respect to traditional topographical systems (such as GPSs and robotized total stations), which on the contrary provide data that are accurate but necessarily limited to a small number of control points (Teza et al., 2008). Currently landslide analysis operators can select the most proper methodology with respect to their specific needs, which can be related to the different civil protection phases, technical issues, financial budget, environmental factors and specific features of the studied instability phenomena. The selection of the proper methodology to be adopted can be related to technical issues, <b>economic</b> <b>budget,</b> environmental factors and specific feature of the landslides to be monitored. Because of a growing demand for effective Civil Protection procedures in pre- and post-disaster initiatives in landslide-prone areas, the purpose of researchers in the near future is to improve the investigative capacity of the such instruments and consequently to extend their fields of application. In fact, landslides managing in order to reduce vulnerability is currently considered more feasible (in terms of faster and extensive results) than governing all the natural conditions leading to instability, such as the spatial distribution of geology and geomorphology and the climatic influence.|$|E
