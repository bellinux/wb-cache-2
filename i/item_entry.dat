50|$|Additionally, {{most studies}} {{investigating}} gratitude journals {{have found that}} including 3-10 items in each gratitude journal entry yields the most beneficial results. While the majority of research has participants only write 3 things in their journal per entry, some {{studies have found that}} even writing 10 <b>items</b> per <b>entry</b> yields positive results for the author. However, researchers suggest that writing too many <b>items</b> per <b>entry</b> (above 10) will actually not yield the typical psychological benefits of a gratitude journal. With a higher number of items to record, the task of writing in a gratitude journal can become too tedious for individuals to comply with. Psychologist Robert A. Emmons believes that humans adapt to positive changes quickly, and that too many and too frequent gratitude journal entries will not have the same beneficial effects as shorter, less frequent entries. Including more than 10 items may even take away the salience of recognizing what there is to be grateful for in daily life.|$|R
5000|$|Clothing {{swapping}} {{can further}} promote the reduction, reuse, and recycling of clothing. By reusing clothing that's {{already been made}} and recycling clothing from one owner to another, source reduction can be achieved.

Through the method of clothing swapping,an alternative resource for consumers to ultimately save in regards to money and time is provided.

40|$|Background: Medication {{communication}} from physicians to patients often is poor, by this among others enhancing {{the risk of}} non-adherence. In this context, a neglect regarding the prescription talk has been complained. Aim of the project: In a newly developed elective medical students work on physician-patient conversations dealing with drug prescription. Essential aspects related to an effective and safe drug treatment are combined with steps of shared decision-making. Together with a tutor, students develop a (model) conversation guide that might be tailored according to individual needs and views. Description/Methods: In a one-week course 3 rd- 5 th year medical students treat a paper case according to problem-based learning.

During a workshop, aspects of drug treatment and patient participation are integrated into a guide for a prescription talk.
