40|$|Abstract. Compiling a solver-independent {{constraint}} {{model to}} solver input usually involves <b>flattening,</b> the decomposition of complex constraints into simpler expressions {{to suit the}} solver, introducing additional variables and constraints. In previous work [8], we have proposed extending <b>flattening</b> with common subexpression elimination (CSE) which can reduce the overhead introduced during <b>flattening.</b> In this work, we formally analyse the cost of standard <b>flattening</b> and CSEbased flattening: we compare time and space complexity and investigate the potential variable and constraint reduction from CSE-based <b>flattening,</b> its scope and limitations. Furthermore, we discuss <b>flattening</b> whole problem classes and show how to integrate CSE into class-wise <b>flattening.</b> We highlight the differences to instance-wise <b>flattening</b> and discuss open questions. Finally, our empirical analysis confirms our theoretical findings and demonstrates the benefits of CSE-based <b>flattening.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|In Cuba, {{the storm}} caused {{hundreds}} of deaths, capsized dozens of ships, obliterated buildings, uprooted trees, and ruined crops. Many towns were wholly destroyed or <b>flattened</b> and never recovered, while others disappeared entirely. Damage in the United States was considerably better-chronicled despite being less severe. In Key West, widespread destruction was noted, with 40deaths, many vessels rendered unfit, and widespread structural damage, with several buildings swept off of their foundations {{and hundreds of}} others <b>flattened.</b> Few supplies arrived in the following days and relief efforts were gradual, with few resources within the town's vicinity. Along other sections of the Southeastern U.S. coast, copious rainfall and moderate winds impacted agriculture, shipping, and residences. As the storm tracked along the Middle-Atlantic coast, similar effects were reported: there, the gale inundated many areas, impeded communications, destroyed railroads and canals, and <b>flattened</b> structures. Despite extensive damage, only two deaths were recorded outside Cuba and Florida. Along its entire track, the hurricane caused $338,000 in losses and at least 164deaths.|$|E

30|$|Roll <b>flattening</b> is an {{important}} component in the roll stack elastic deformation, which has important influence on controlling of the strip crown and flatness. Foppl formula and semi-infinite body model are the most popular analytical models in the roll <b>flattening</b> calculation. However, the roll <b>flattening</b> calculated by traditional <b>flattening</b> models has a great deviation from actual situation, especially near the barrel edges. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy of roll <b>flattening,</b> a new model is proposed based on the elastic half plane theory. The calculation formulas of roll <b>flattening</b> are deduced respectively under the assumptions of plane strain and plane stress. Then, the two assumptions are combined through the method of introducing an transition coefficient, and the distribution rules of roll <b>flattening</b> for different rolling force, <b>flattening</b> width, roll length and roll diameter are analyzed by using the FEM analysis software Marc. Regarding the ratio of the length to roll end and the roll diameter as variable to fit the transition coefficient, the new model of roll <b>flattening</b> is established based on the elastic half plane theory. Finally, the transition coefficient is fitted to establish the model. Compared with the traditional models, the new model can effectively improve the calculation deviation in the roll end, which has important significance for accurate simulation of plate shape, especially for the distribution of rolling force between rolls.|$|R

A segmented clothing range map is B-Spline smoothed prior to being parsed by means of shape and topology into ‘wrinkle’ structures. The wrinkle length, width and height are used to quantify the topology of wrinkles and thereby rank the size of wrinkles such that a greedy algorithm can identify the largest wrinkle present. A <b>flattening</b> plan optimised for this specific wrinkle is formulated based on dual-arm manipulation. Validation of the reported autonomous <b>flattening</b> behaviour has been undertaken and has demonstrated that dual-arm <b>flattening</b> requires significantly fewer manipulation iterations than single-arm <b>flattening.</b> The experimental results also revel that the <b>flattening</b> process is heavily influenced by the quality of the RGB-D sensor, use of a custom off-the-shelf high-resolution stereo-based sensor system outperforming a commercial low-resolution kinect-like camera in terms of required <b>flattening</b> iterations...|$|R

Compiling solver-independent {{constraint}} {{models to}} solver input typically involves <b>flattening,</b> the decomposition of complex expressions into simpler expressions, introducing additional variables and constraints. In previous work [8], we have informally proposed extending <b>flattening</b> problem instances with common subexpression elimination(CSE), a widespread optimisation technique {{that has not}} yet been established in Constraint Programming (CP). This paper extends our previous work with three main contributions. First, we formally analyse the cost of <b>flattening</b> instances with CSE, comparing instance reduction and time/space complexity with standard <b>flattening,</b> which outlines its scope. Second, we present how {{to increase the number of}} common subexpressions in a constraint model by reformulation and include a formal cost analysis. Third, we show how to lift the approach of <b>flattening</b> instances to whole problem classes, an alternative, novel approach to instance-wise compilation. We formally integrate CSE into class-wise flattening,and show when class-wise compilation is preferable to instance-wise compilation. Finally, experiments confirm our theoretical findings and demonstrate the benefits of CSE-based <b>flattening.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Iterative <b>Flattening</b> Search (IFS) is a meta-heuristic {{strategy}} for solving multi-capacity optimization scheduling problems. Given an initial solution, IFS iteratively applies two-steps: (1) {{a subset of}} solving decisions are randomly retracted from a current solution (relaxation-step); (2) a new solution is incrementally recomputed (flattening-step). In this paper we present {{the results of an}} experimental investigation on IFS, which considers algorithmic variants of the <b>flattening</b> step endowed with different computational complexity and effectiveness. In particular, this paper considers <b>flattening</b> procedures using constraint propagation and studies its effect within the meta-heuristic framework. The current analysis is centered around the idea that given a time bound to the optimization process, the IFS optimization is composed by two different and contrasting mechanism: the random sampling performed by the application of the relaxation-flattening steps and the inner <b>flattening</b> search procedure. The more complex (and effective) is the <b>flattening</b> procedure, the lower is the number of iterative sampling cycles. The study is performed on four different <b>flattening</b> procedures of various complexity. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} and evaluates enhanced loop <b>flattening,</b> a compiler {{framework for}} transforming an arbitrary set of nested and sequenced loops {{into a single}} loop with additional logic to implement the control flow of the original code. Loop <b>flattening</b> allows conventional software pipelining algorithms to effectively pipeline nested loops. Conventional software pipelining approaches are only applicable to inner loops, which can result in poor resource utilization. Existing approaches to loop <b>flattening</b> tend to create long latency inter-iteration feedback paths, which limit the performance of pipelined loops. Enhanced loop <b>flattening</b> gives the compiler the ability to precisely control iteration distances along each control flow path, reducing the initiation interval (the “clock period ” of a pipelined loop) by inserting “pipeline bubbles ” under specific dynamic conditions. On a benchmark set of compute-intensive kernels, we found that conventional loop <b>flattening</b> performed somewhat worse than inner-loop only pipelining, but enhanced loop <b>flattening</b> with a simple heuristic for iteration distance selection performed substantially better (geometric mean of 30 % less run time). Because of the fairly large number of single-bit operations and registers that are required for predicate logic, enhanced loop <b>flattening</b> is most directly applicable to FPGA-like parallel accelerators. 1...|$|R
