5|$|A study {{published}} in the Neuropsychopharmacology journal in 2013 revealed the finding that the flavour of beer alone could provoke dopamine activity in the brain of the male participants, who wanted to drink more as a result. The 49 men in the study were subject to positron <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> scans, while a computer-controlled device sprayed minute amounts of beer, water and a sports drink onto their tongues. Compared with the taste of the sports drink, the taste of beer significantly increased the participants desire to drink. Test results indicated that the flavour of the beer triggered a dopamine release, even though alcohol content in the spray was insufficient for the purpose of becoming intoxicated.|$|E

5|$|If {{investigations}} confirm NSCLC, {{the stage}} is assessed {{to determine whether the}} disease is localized and amenable to surgery or if it has spread {{to the point where it}} cannot be cured surgically. CT scan and positron <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> are used for this determination. If mediastinal lymph node involvement is suspected, the nodes may be sampled to assist staging. Techniques used for this include transthoracic needle aspiration, transbronchial needle aspiration (with or without endobronchial ultrasound), endoscopic ultrasound with needle aspiration, mediastinoscopy, and thoracoscopy. Blood tests and pulmonary function testing are used to assess whether a person is well enough for surgery. If pulmonary function tests reveal poor respiratory reserve, surgery may not be possible.|$|E
5|$|Of the ten other {{isotopes}} produced synthetically, {{ranging from}} 12N to 23N, 13N has a half-life of ten minutes {{and the remaining}} isotopes have half-lives {{on the order of}} seconds (16N and 17N) or even milliseconds. No other nitrogen isotopes are possible as they would fall outside the nuclear drip lines, leaking out a proton or neutron. Given the half-life difference, 13N is the most important nitrogen radioisotope, being relatively long-lived enough to use in positron <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> (PET), although its half-life is still short and thus it must be produced at the venue of the PET, for example in a cyclotron via proton bombardment of 16O producing 13N and an alpha particle.|$|E
5|$|Blood tests may be {{performed}} to exclude other causes of muscle disease (elevated creatine kinase may indicate a myositis, and abnormal thyroid function tests may indicate thyrotoxic myopathy). Antibodies against voltage-gated calcium channels {{can be identified}} in 85% of people with EMG-confirmed LEMS. Once LEMS is diagnosed, investigations such as a CT scan of the chest are usually performed to identify any possible underlying lung tumors. Around 50–60% of these are discovered immediately after the diagnosis of LEMS. The remainder is diagnosed later, but usually within two years and typically within four years. As a result, scans are typically repeated every six months {{for the first two}} years after diagnosis. While CT of the lungs is usually adequate, a positron <b>emission</b> <b>tomography</b> scan of the body may also {{be performed}} to search for an occult tumour, particularly of the lung.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Introduction Rosai-Dorfman disease, {{also known}} as sinus {{histiocytosis}} with massive lymphadenopathy, is a rare benign disorder characterized histologically by lymphatic sinus dilatation due to histiocyte proliferation. Rosai-Dorfman disease accompanied by IgG 4 + plasma cell infiltration is an even rarer situation. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, no imaging report of fluoro-deoxyglucose positron <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> findings of Rosai-Dorfman disease with IgG 4 + plasma cell infiltration has been published, although a series of pathological research has focused on this phenomenon. Case presentation We reviewed the 18 F-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> scan of a 78 -year-old Chinese woman with a solid mass that was found in her right breast during a health checkup. 18 F-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> showed a hypermetabolic nodule in her right breast and slightly heterogeneous increased fluoro-deoxyglucose uptake of the pulmonary nodules, which were histologically proven to be mammary Rosai-Dorfman disease with IgG 4 + plasma cell infiltration and pulmonary amyloidosis, respectively. A literature review was performed to gather information on this rare disease process. Conclusions Although distinguishing benign lymphoplasmacytic proliferation from malignancy may be difficult with 18 F-fluoro-deoxyglucose positron <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> in light of the pattern and intensity of fluoro-deoxyglucose uptake, our case highlights that whole-body positron <b>emission</b> tomography/computed <b>tomography</b> imaging not only can display the extent of the disease to help complete staging but also can provide functional information about disease activity to guide biopsy. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Left {{ventricular}} {{ejection fraction}} {{can be measured}} {{by a variety of}} invasive and non-invasive cardiac techniques. This study assesses the relation of three diagnostic modalities {{to each other in the}} measurement of left ventricular ejection fraction: invasive contrast left ventriculography, two-dimensional echocardiography, and quantitative gated single-photon <b>emission</b> computed <b>tomography.</b> Methods: Retrospective chart review was conducted on 58 patients hospitalized with chest pain, who underwent left ventricular ejection fraction evaluation using each of the aforementioned modalities within a 3 -month period not interrupted by myocardial infarction or revascularization. Results: The mean left ventricular ejection fraction values were as follows: invasive contrast left ventriculography (0. 44 ± 0. 15), two-dimensional echocardiography (0. 46 ± 0. 13), and gated single-photon <b>emission</b> computed <b>tomography</b> (0. 37 ± 0. 10). Correlations coefficients and associated p values were as follows: invasive contrast left ventriculography versus two-dimensional echocardiography (r= 0. 69, p< 0. 001), invasive contrast left ventriculography versus gated single-photon <b>emission</b> computed <b>tomography</b> (r= 0. 80, p< 0. 0001), and gated single-photon <b>emission</b> computed <b>tomography</b> versus two-dimensional echocardiography (r= 0. 69, p< 0. 001). Conclusion: Our results indicate that strong positive correlations exist among the three techniques studied...|$|R
