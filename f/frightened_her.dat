25|$|After {{the death}} of her mother early in her life, Sophia Magdalena was given a very strict and {{religious}} upbringing by her grandmother and her stepmother, who considered her father and brother to be morally degenerate. She is noted to have had good relationships with her siblings, her grandmother and her stepmother; her father, however, often <b>frightened</b> <b>her</b> when he came before her drunk, and was reportedly known to set his dogs upon her, causing in her a lifelong phobia.|$|E
25|$|After {{her father}} retired from service, she {{continued}} playing with broken sabers and <b>frightened</b> <b>her</b> family by secretly taming a stallion that they considered unbreakable. In 1801, {{she married a}} Sarapul judge V.S. Chernov and {{gave birth to a}} son in 1803. Some accounts claim that she ran away from her home with a Cossack officer in 1805. In 1807, at the age of twenty-four she disguised herself as a boy, deserted her son and husband, and bringing her horse Alkid, enlisted in the Polish Horse Regiment (later classified as Uhlans) under the alias Alexander Sokolov.|$|E

25|$|As an avid reader, in the Netherlands {{she found}} new books {{and ways of}} thought that both {{stretched}} her imagination and <b>frightened</b> <b>her.</b> Sigmund Freud's work introduced her to an alternative moral system that was not based on religion. During this time she took courses in Dutch and a one-year introductory course in social work at the De Horst Institute for Social Work in Driebergen. She has {{said that she was}} impressed with how well Dutch society seemed to function. To better understand its development, she studied at Leiden University, obtaining an MSc degree in political science in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Without any obvious cause Genie's {{incontinence}} immediately resurfaced, and {{was especially}} severe {{for the first}} few weeks after she moved in but persisted at a lower level for several months. In contrast to Butler's writings, the Riglers observed Genie still acted out her anger on herself and noted that certain situations in particular, such as spilling containers of liquid, sent her into tantrum behavior, which doctors attributed to her having been beaten for these actions as a child. The research team recorded her speech being much more halting and hesitant than Butler described, writing that Genie very rarely spoke and that, for {{the first three months of}} her stay, almost always used one-word utterances. Unless she saw something which <b>frightened</b> <b>her</b> both her speech and behavior exhibited a great deal of latency, often several minutes delayed, for no clear reason, and she still had no reaction to temperature. She continued to have a very difficult time controlling her impulses, frequently engaging in highly anti-social and destructive behavior.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to her linguistic abilities, Genie's nonverbal communication continued to excel. She invented her own system of gestures and pantomimed certain words {{as she said}} them, and also acted out events which she could not express in language. Initially she would only draw pictures if someone asked her to, but during her stay with the Riglers she began to use drawings to communicate if she could not explain something in words. In addition to her own drawings she often used pictures from magazines to relate to daily experiences, and for reasons the scientists never determined especially did so after encountering things that <b>frightened</b> <b>her.</b> Some time during mid-1972 Marilyn observed that a magazine picture of a wolf sent Genie into a terror, after which the Riglers asked Genie's mother if she knew a possible cause for this reaction; she then informed them {{that her husband had}} acted like a dog to intimidate Genie, making the underlying reason for her fear apparent to the scientists for the first time.|$|E

She had originally intended to write a story about zombies, but was discouraged by her editor T-shi and decided to abandon the idea during the third chapter. Asked about her inspiration for writing about the supernatural, Hoshino said that she feared it after seeing the 1973 film, The Exorcist. Although the horror film <b>frightened</b> <b>her,</b> it inspired the author to design the manga's Akumas.|$|E
500|$|On 13 June 1903 Goddard {{married her}} friend John Ellingham Brooks, an {{unsuccessful}} pianist and translator {{who was in}} deep financial difficulty. He was homosexual and Goddard never revealed exactly why she married him. Her first biographer Meryle Secrest suggests that she was motivated by concern for him and a desire for companionship, rather than {{the need for a}} marriage of convenience. They quarreled almost immediately when she cut her hair and ordered men's clothes for a planned walking tour of England; he refused to be seen in public with her dressed that way. Chafing at his desire for outward propriety, she left him after only a year and moved to London. He <b>frightened</b> <b>her</b> because he kept making references to [...] "our" [...] money. Brooks spent {{the rest of his life}} on Capri (where he died in 1929) and, for a while, lived there with E. F. Benson, author of the Mapp and Lucia novels.|$|E
