Primitive stencils of human <b>hands,</b> the white <b>prints</b> were executed by [...] "placing the hand up against the wall and then blowing a mixture of red ochre and water around them, leaving a negative image on the rock". The red <b>hand</b> <b>prints</b> could have been produced by immersing the hand in a solution tinted red from [...] "chewed-up foliage". The <b>hand</b> <b>prints</b> face both left and right. Some are missing a thumb; it was common practice to cut off a finger when an elder died. According to an official with the Makassar Center for Cultural and Heritage Preservation, the palm of the hand was believed to have power to ward off [...] "evil forces and wild animals", thus protecting the people who lived inside the cave. In addition to the <b>hand</b> <b>prints,</b> a roughly half-meter (two-foot) long painting of a red hog deer is in the middle.|$|R

Thus, for an automated system to process writer identification or verification, it is desirable {{to determine whether a}} sample of handwritten text is of a <b>hand</b> <b>printed</b> or cursive nature. We identify a feature based upon the number of segmented words and number of connected components which are identified as single characters. We evaluate the performance of this feature by using all 4, 701 documents present CEDAR letter dataset and find that using this feature identifies documents as <b>hand</b> <b>printed</b> correctly 95 % of the time and identifies them as cursive 91 % of the time. 1...|$|R

40|$|Problem statement: The use of {{computers}} in information processing technology nowadays&# 13; {{is one of the}} main trends of office automation. For more than four decades, information from the&# 13; outside world is transferred into computers in a traditional way by keying in these raw data with the&# 13; help of keyboard. Most of these data are in <b>hand</b> <b>printed</b> form and very large; therefore the use of&# 13; automatic recognition technique of <b>hand</b> <b>printed</b> character by machine is essential to achieve an&# 13; efficient way of high speed man-machine communication. Approach: Handwriting recognition had&# 13; always been tough problem because of the handwriting variability, ambiguity and illegibility. This&# 13; study described a simple approach involved in offline <b>hand</b> <b>printed</b> recognition. Results: The cost of&# 13; computing had been reduced a lot by introducing a simple mechanism yet effective to extract the&# 13; minimal number of geometric features for recognitions purpose. Conclusion: The experiment had&# 13; shown that when <b>hand</b> <b>printed</b> characters are drawn clearly according to specified rules and models; it&# 13; is then possible to perform recognition perfectly...|$|R
