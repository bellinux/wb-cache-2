25|$|Dried <b>fennel</b> <b>seed</b> is an aromatic, anise-flavored spice, {{brown or}} green in color when fresh, slowly turning a dull grey as the seed ages. For cooking, green seeds are optimal. The leaves are delicately flavored and similar in shape {{to those of}} dill. The bulb is a crisp {{vegetable}} that can be sautéed, stewed, braised, grilled, or eaten raw. Young tender leaves are used for garnishes, as a salad, to add flavor to salads, to flavor sauces to be served with puddings, and also in soups and fish sauce.|$|E
25|$|The broth for beef pho is {{generally}} made by simmering beef bones, oxtails, flank steak, charred onion, charred ginger and spices. For a more intense flavor, the bones {{may still have}} beef on them. Chicken bones also work and produce a similar broth. Seasonings can include Saigon cinnamon or other kinds of cinnamon as alternatives (may use usually in stick form, sometimes in powder form in pho restaurant franchises overseas), star anise, roasted ginger, roasted onion, black cardamom, coriander seed, <b>fennel</b> <b>seed,</b> and clove. The broth takes several hours to make. For chicken pho, only the meat and bones of the chicken are used in place of beef and beef bone. The remaining spices remain the same, but the charred ginger can be omitted, since its function in beef pho is to subdue the quite strong smell of beef.|$|E

The aim {{was to assess the}} health and physiological quality of <b>fennel</b> <b>seeds</b> (Foeniculum vulgare Mill.), both freshly harvested and stored for three years, and submitted to thermotherapy. Two experiments were conducted. In the first, thermotherapy was carried out on freshly-harvested <b>fennel</b> <b>seeds</b> obtained under different cropping systems: T 1 - Monocrop fennel treated with the insecticide, thiamethoxam; T 2 - Monocrop fennel without the application of insecticide; T 3 - Fennel intercropped with cotton and treated with insecticide; T 4 - Intercropped fennel without the application of insecticide. In the second experiment, seeds were used which had been stored for three years and obtained from plants, both treated and untreated with insecticide. The seeds were exposed to dry heat for different periods (0, 3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 days) at 70 °C. The tests performed included: health, germination, first count, speed germination index, seedling length and dry weight. The cropping systems had no influence on the incidence of the fungus Alternaria sp. Stored <b>fennel</b> <b>seeds</b> coming from plants treated with insecticide, display better health and physiological quality. A period of 12 days of thermotherapy is effective in controlling the fungus Alternaria sp. without causing losses in the viability of the <b>fennel</b> <b>seeds...</b>|$|R
