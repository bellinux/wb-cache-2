2500|$|Disc brakes {{require a}} hub built {{to accept the}} disc, and a fork (for front brakes) or frame (for rear brakes) built to accept the caliper. [...] Front hubs {{designed}} for discs often move the left hub's flange inward {{to make room for}} the disc, which causes the wheel to be dished. [...] A dished wheel is laterally weaker when forced to the non-disc side. [...] Other hubs use conventional <b>flange</b> <b>spacing</b> and provide a wheel without dish, but require a less common wide-spaced fork.|$|E
5000|$|Several factors affect these {{stiffnesses}} {{to varying}} degrees. These include wheel radius, rim bending and torsional stiffness, number of spokes, spoke gauge, lacing pattern, hub stiffness, hub <b>flange</b> <b>spacing,</b> hub radius. In general lateral and radial stiffness decreases {{with the number}} of spoke crossings and torsional stiffness increases {{with the number of}} spoke crossings. One factor that has little influence on these stiffnesses is spoke tension.|$|E
50|$|On {{traditionally}} spoked wheels, <b>flange</b> <b>spacing</b> {{affects the}} lateral stiffness {{of the wheel}}, with wider being stiffer, and flange diameter affects the torsional stiffness of the wheel {{and the number of}} spoke holes that the hub can accept, with larger diameter being stiffer and accepting more holes. Asymmetrical flange diameters, tried to mitigate the adverse effects of asymmetrical spacing and dish necessary on rear wheels with many sprockets, have also been used with modest benefits.|$|E
50|$|Over time, {{the number}} of {{sprockets}} in a cogset has increased, from three or four before World War II, to five used from the 1950s to the 1970s, up to the eight, nine, ten, eleven, or twelve now found on modern bikes. As more rear sprockets were added, the combination became wider, and the sprocket spacing narrower. One {{of the ways to}} make space for this was the axle length (measured as the Over Locknut Distance — O.L.D.) was increased, necessitating more dish on the rear wheel drive side with a threaded hub to centre the wheel in the frame. The hub <b>flanges</b> <b>spacing</b> was not shortened on threaded hubs, rather the axle length increased from 120 mm O.L.D. (five-speed/compact six) to 126 mm O.L.D. (six-speed/compact seven) through to 130 mm O.L.D. (threaded seven-speed) for a road bike. MTB rear spacing is normally 135 mm O.L.D. Another advantage of the Shimano cassette hubs introduced from 1978 was that the rear hub flanges were wider apart than those of a threaded hub, so built a stronger wheel with less dish and without the problem of increased bearing stress or axle failure.|$|R
40|$|Local {{buckling}} {{of steel}} H－shape {{encased in concrete}} may be well prevented by surrounding reinforced concrete portion. Therefore, the limit value of width-thickness ratio for steel plate elements of encased columns could be much larger than that for bare steel elements, but such a relieving provision is not yet found in structural specifications. Concrete encased steel H-shape columns are tested under combined vertical and horizontal loads, with varyjng values of axial load ratio, width－thickness ratio of a <b>flange</b> and <b>spacing</b> of hoops. The paper presents test results and discusses load－deflection behavior of encased columns with large width-thickness ratio, by comparing the test results {{with the results of}} elasto-plastic analysis and rigid-plastic post-buckling analysis...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a preliminary study {{into the design}} and behaviour of steel plywood composite beams. These beams comprise a web using conventional readily available plywood with flanges made from cold-formed steel sections. The most highly stressed parts are the steel flanges and the plywood webs, typically 10 - 12 mm thick provide shear resistance and are not susceptible to web buckling or crippling. The flanges {{are attached to the}} webs using self-tapping screws. The paper describes the manufacture and assembly of steel-plywood beams and presents the results of a series of structural loading tests on the beams. The variables considered in the tests are: the thickness and geometry of the <b>flange,</b> the <b>spacing</b> of fasteners, the thickness of plywood and the use of orientated strand board. The results show that steel-plywood beams are an easily assembled alternative to other lightweight fabricated joist systems for the medium span range 5 - 12 metres. © 2006 Taylor & Francis Group...|$|R
5000|$|The single {{external}} sprocket {{means that}} the wheel can have a hub with more distance between its flanges and be built with no or much less dish, making it laterally stronger than a similar wheel with narrower <b>flange</b> <b>spacing</b> and more dish to accommodate multiple sprockets. The hub shell of gear hubs is also often of a larger diameter than that of derailleur hubs, meaning the spokes on such wheels may be shorter.|$|E

5000|$|Rolling {{stock on}} the network must have running gear (wheelsets) that are {{compatible}} with the gauge, and therefore the gauge is a key parameter in determining interoperability, {{but there are many}} others—see below. In some cases in the earliest days of railways, the railway company saw itself as an infrastructure provider only, and independent hauliers provided wagons suited to the gauge. Colloquially the wagons might be referred to as [...] "four-foot gauge wagons", say, if the track had a gauge of four feet. This nominal value does not equate to the <b>flange</b> <b>spacing,</b> as some freedom is allowed for.|$|E
50|$|The powered {{rotary hoe}} {{was invented by}} Arthur Clifford Howard who, in 1912, began experimenting with rotary tillage on his father's farm at Gilgandra, New South Wales, Australia. Initially using his father's steam tractor engine as a power source, he found that ground could be {{mechanically}} tilled without soil-packing occurring, {{as was the case}} with normal ploughing. His earliest designs threw the tilled soil sideways, until he improved his invention by designing an L-shaped blade mounted on widely <b>spaced</b> <b>flanges</b> fixed to a small-diameter rotor. With fellow apprentice Everard McCleary, he established a company to make his machine, but plans were interrupted by World War I. In 1919 Howard returned to Australia and resumed his design work, patenting a design with 5 rotary hoe cultivator blades and an internal combustion engine in 1920.|$|R
40|$|Due to heamline space constrictions and the {{modular design}} of the vacuum system. a {{conventional}} bellows {{can not be used}} everywhere in the PEP-II High-Energy Ring (HER) arcs. A zero-length “Flex Flange ” was developed which actually performs better than a more standard bellows. The Flex <b>Flange</b> fits the <b>space</b> available while still preserving the modularity of the system. Furthermore, the-design provides for an accurate match-up between adjoining octagonal copper chambers despite the large fabrication and assembly tolerances and high operational loads. Beam chamber continuity is ensured by an integral RF seal ring which is easy to install and fault-tolerant. Heating from synchrotron radiation and higher-order mode trapping is managed to ensure a robust connection despite the 3000 mA beam current of the PEP-II HER. The Flex Flange concept is versatile and adaptable to many applications. yet economical both in space needed and cost...|$|R
40|$|An {{efficient}} multi-objective design tailoring procedure {{seeking to}} improve the vibroacoustic performance of a fuselage panel while maintaining or reducing weight is presented. The structure considered is the pultruded rod stitched efficient unitized structure, a highly integrated composite structure concept designed for a noncylindrical, next-generation flight vehicle fuselage. Modifications to a baseline design are evaluated within a six-parameter design <b>space</b> including <b>spacing,</b> <b>flange</b> width, and web height for both frame and stringer substructure components. The change in sound power radiation attributed to a design change is predicted using finite-element models sized and meshed for analyses in the 500 Hz, 1 kHz, and 2 kHz octave bands. Three design studies are carried out in parallel while considering a diffuse acoustic field excitation and two types of turbulent boundary-layer excitation. Kriging surrogate models are used to reduce the computational costs of resolving the vibroacoustic and weight objective Pareto fronts. The resulting Pareto optimal designs are then evaluated under a static pressurization ultimate load to assess structural strength and stability. Results suggest that choosing alternative configurations within the considered design space can reduce weight and improve vibroacoustic performance without compromising strength and stability of the structure under the static load condition considered, but the tradeoffs are significantly influenced by the spatial characteristics of the assumed excitation field...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{an effort}} to {{encourage}} the development of value-added engineered applications for small-diameter round timber, research is being conducted at the US Forest Products Laboratory to develop and verify design guidelines for connections with specific application to round timbers. The objective {{of this study is}} to provide potential users with a number of viable connection options applicable to the fabrica tion of engineered, round-timber structural components and systems. Target uses include trusses, built-up <b>flange</b> beams, and <b>space</b> frames. This article presents information on a mortised steel-plate connection fabricated using power-driven nails in 150 -mm-dia ponderosa pine. The article discusses methods used to determine per nail load capacity and to develop design procedures that incorporate that value in the determination of a multinail connection design value. These connections offer the advantage of low labor and material cost, ductile failure modes, and strengths in the range of 4. 7 kN/nail. The failure of the connections was mode III nail failure and wood block shear failure. Joints that failed in block shear appeared to have roughly the same strength as those that failed from nail yield. The National Design Specification yield model for nails provides accurate predictions of joint capacity for nail yield-type failures and overestimates strength of joints that exhibit wood failure. Block shear capacity can be estimated on the basis of clear-wood strength and effective tensile and shear area of the connection...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of vinyl nail-on {{windows in the}} North American new home construction market has prompted ASTM International to write ASTM E 2112 - 01 "Standard Practice for Installation of Exterior Windows, Doors and Skylights". This thesis focuses on the window jamb flashing recommendation in ASTM E 2112 - 01 for vinyl nail-on windows by asking {{the question of whether}} a vinyl window's integral nail-on flange is by itself an adequate jamb flashing. To answer this question, the Jamb Drip Test was designed and completed on fourteen (14) window/wall details. The answer to the question depends on the window/wall construction sequence. When the weather resistant barrier (WRB) is installed prior to the window, it isn't. When the WRB is installed after the window, the nail-on fin is by itself an adequate jamb flashing. Based on this Jamb Drip Test study, a recommended window/wall construction sequence of sheathing- flashing (sill, jamb and head) - vinyl nail-on window - WRB - siding option is proposed. This sequence recognizes that while the nail-on fin may be an adequate jamb flashing, without flashing, the designer cannot take full advantage of the symbiotic relationship between the nail-on <b>flange</b> and the <b>space</b> it creates between the adjoining building elements (e. g. sheathing and the WRB). In this capacity, jamb flashing is added to the construction sequence to protect the sheathing from wetting and aid in directing incidental water to the exterior. Based on this proposed construction sequence, effort was focused on improving the present state of the art window/wall weatherproofing detail. An alternative to the use of high performance sealant to create the seal between the flashing and the window's nail-on flange is proposed. The present recommendation uses a(cont.) one-piece folded sheet that envelops the window flange, WRB {{and at the same time}} incorporates the window flashing function. This novel, dual function (window seal + window flashing system) product is called w-Flashing. The thesis ends with a description of w-Flashing's performance attributes, prototype design and recommended installation sequence around a vinyl nail-on window. by Austin Parsons. Thesis (S. M.)
