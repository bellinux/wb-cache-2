25|$|Today both {{countries}} have extensive economic ties {{and engage in}} a high volume of trade, {{with an emphasis on}} technology and research and development in the spheres of bio-technology and defense. Israel's national airline El Al does not fly to Singapore as Singapore is located in the region of Indonesia and Malaysia, both of which do not recognise Israel as a state which makes attaining flight rights impossible. Israel has had diplomatic representation in Singapore since its earliest days, with representation formalised in 1968. Singapore is a regional hub for Israeli businesses, while a growing number of members of both business communities seek opportunities for joint ventures in biotechnology, IT and the software industries. Several bilateral agreements provide a solid <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> <b>cooperation</b> in areas such as healthcare, defence, and technological research & development. Most recently, in 1997, a bi-national fund for financing new technological products was set up, an indicator of deepening bilateral relations between both states. Cultural exchanges have been accentuated by encouraging the participation of Israeli artists in international events in Singapore, cultivating a broad interest in Israeli performing arts. The yearly Film Festival has grown to become a cornerstone in the structured framework of activities.|$|E

2500|$|The German {{constitution}} guarantees {{freedom of}} religion, {{but there is}} not a complete {{separation of church and state}} in Germany. Officially recognized religious bodies operate as Körperschaften des öffentlichen Rechts (corporations of public law, as opposed to private). For recognized religious communities, some taxes are collected by the state; this is at the request of the religious community and a fee is charged for the service. Religious instruction is an optional school subject in Germany. The German State understands itself as neutral in matters of religious beliefs, so no teacher can be forced to teach religion. But on the other hand, all who do teach religious instruction need an official permission by their religious community. The treaties with the Holy See are referred to as concordats whereas the treaties with Protestant Churches and umbrellas of Jewish congregations are called [...] "state treaties". Both are the legal <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> <b>cooperation</b> between the religious bodies and the German State at the federal as well as at the state level.|$|E

40|$|Evolutionary {{game theory}} {{is one of}} the key {{paradigms}} behind many scientific disciplines from science to engineering. Previous studies proposed a strategy updating mechanism, which successfully demonstrated that the scale-free network can provide a <b>framework</b> <b>for</b> the emergence of cooperation. Instead, individuals in random graphs and small-world networks do not favor cooperation under this updating rule. However, a recent empirical result shows the heterogeneous networks do not promote cooperation when humans play a Prisoner's Dilemma. In this paper, we propose a strategy updating rule with payoff memory. We observe that the random graphs and small-world networks can provide even better <b>frameworks</b> <b>for</b> <b>cooperation</b> than the scale-free networks in this scenario. Our observations suggest that the degree heterogeneity may be neither a sufficient condition nor a necessary condition <b>for</b> the widespread <b>cooperation</b> in complex networks. Also, the topological structures are not sufficed to determine the level of cooperation in complex networks. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
