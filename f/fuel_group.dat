40|$|There {{are more}} than 250 forms of U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) -owned spent nuclear fuel (SNF). Due to the variety of the spent nuclear fuel, the National Spent Nuclear Fuel Program has {{designated}} nine representative fuel groups for disposal criticality analyses based on fuel matrix, primary fissile isotope, and enrichment (DOE 2000 b, Section 6. 6. 8). The Melt and Dilute (MD) SNF has been designated as the representative fuel for the high-enriched U-Al <b>fuel</b> <b>group.</b> The MD SNF consists of homogeneous cylindrical ingots with 16. 5 in. (419. 1 mm) maximum diameter. Two general ingot compositions are considered in the criticality and geochemistry analyses. The first composition consists of 8. 2 to 18. 2 wt% uranium, enriched at less than 20 wt% U- 235 and 0. 5 wt% gadolinium, with {{the balance of the}} ingot being aluminum. The second composition is identical to the first for uranium and gadolinium, but in this case 2. 5 wt% of the ingot is hafnium, with the balance of the ingot being aluminum. The results of the analyses performed will be used to develop waste acceptance criteria. The items that are important to criticality control are identified based on the analysis needs and result sensitivities. Prior to acceptance of fuel from the high-enriched U-Al <b>fuel</b> <b>group</b> for disposal, the important items for the fuel types that are being considered for disposal under the high-enriched U-Al <b>fuel</b> <b>group</b> must be demonstrated to satisfy the conditions determined in this report. The analyses have been performed by following the disposal criticality analysis methodology, which was documented in the ''Disposal Criticality Analysis Methodology Topical Report'' (YMP 2000) submitted to the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The methodology includes analyzing the geochemical and physical processes that can breach the waste package and degrade the waste forms and other internal components, as well as the structural, thermal, and shielding analyses, and intact and degraded component criticality analyses. One or more addenda (validation reports) to the topical report will be required to establish the critical limit for DOE SNF form once sufficient critical benchmarks are identified and verified. The waste package design for MD ingots holds one 18 -in. -outer diameter DOE standardized SNF canister containing the MD ingots, and five defense high-level radioactive waste (DHLW) glass canisters. The 5 -DHLW/DOE SNF-short waste package is based on the Site Recommendation design of waste packages (Appendix A). The waste package design consists of two concentric cylindrical shells in which the waste forms will be placed. The outer shell is made of a corrosion resistant nickel-based alloy (Alloy 22). The inner shell is composed of stainless steel 316 NG (nuclear grade). The waste package design incorporates three lids at the one end of the waste package (one for the inner shell and two for the outer shell) and two lids {{at the other end of}} the waste package (one for each shell). The DOE SNF canister containing three to six MD ingots is placed in a carbon steel support tube that becomes the center of the waste package. The DOE SNF canister is surrounded by five 3 -meter-long Savannah River Site DHLW glass canisters. The five DHLW glass canisters are evenly spaced around the DOE SNF canister. This report presents the results of analyzing the 5 -DHLWDOE SNF-short waste package against various design criteria.

40|$|AbstractExisting wire-wrapped {{fuel bundle}} {{friction}} factor correlations were evaluated {{to identify their}} comparative fit to the available pressure drop experimental data. Five published correlations, those of Rehme (REH), Baxi and Dalle Donne (BDD, which used the correlations of Novendstern in the turbulent regime and Engel et al. in the laminar and transition regimes), detailed Cheng and Todreas (CTD), simplified Cheng and Todreas (CTS), and Kirillov (KIR, developed by Russian scientists) were studied. Other correlations applicable to a specific case were also evaluated but only for that case. Among all 132 available bundle data, an 80 bundle data set was judged to be appropriate for this evaluation. Three methodologies, i. e., the Prediction Error Distribution, Agreement Index and Credit Score were principally used for investigating the goodness of each correlation in fitting the data. Evaluations have been performed in two categories: 4 cases of general user interest and 3 cases of designer specific interest. The four general user interest cases analyzed bundle data sets in four flow regimes – i. e., all regimes, the transition and/or turbulent regimes, the turbulent regime, and the laminar regime. The three designer interest cases analyzed bundles in the <b>fuel</b> <b>group,</b> the blanket and control group and those with P/D> 1. 06, for the transition/turbulent regimes. For all these cases, the detailed Cheng and Todreas correlation is identified as yielding the best fit. Specifically for the all flow regimes evaluation, the best fit correlation in descending order is CTD, BDD/CTS (tie), REH and KIR. For the combined transition/turbulent regime, the order is CTD, BDD, REH, CTS and KIR. In the turbulent regime alone, the order is CTD, BDD/REH, CTS and KIR. In the laminar regime, the order is CTD, CTS, KIR and BDD/REH. For fuel assemblies, the order is CTD, BDD, REH, CTS and KIR. For blanket and control assemblies, the order is CTD, CTS, KIR, REH and BDD. For bundles with P/D> 1. 06, the order {{is the same as}} that for the <b>fuel</b> <b>group.</b> Three supplemental evaluations have been performed, one being the 80 bundle set in the transition and/or turbulent regimes with 8 added CFD simulation results. The other two are based on the appropriate set of 109 bundles covering all flow regimes and 108 bundles covering the transition/turbulent regimes, respectively. In these supplemental evaluations the correlation order is CTD, CTS/BDD, REH and KIR for the CFD results added case; CTD, REH, BDD, CTS and KIR for the 109 bundle case and REH, CTD, BDD, CTS and KIR for the 108 bundle case. Several shortcomings were found in the most recently published evaluation for the best fit correlation by Bubelis and Schikorr. The twenty-two bundle set evaluated by Bubelis and Schikorr is reexamined by the methodologies in this study, resulting in the correlation order of REH, CTD, CTS, BDD and KIR...|$|E

40|$|The primary {{objective}} of this research project is to experimentally investigate the laminar flame structure of syngas and biogas mixtures through Raman laser spectroscopy. The gaseous fuel mixtures have been predetermined by an industrial partner and are composed of varying concentrations of H 2, CO and CH 4 with CO 2 dilution. The laminar flame structure was characterized through measurements of flame temperature as well as major species concentration (H 2, CO, H 2 O, CO 2, O 2, N 2 and CH 4 where applicable) at standard temperature and pressure conditions. The target operating conditions were set at an equivalence ratio of 3 and a Reynolds number of 1400. In total, four different groups of fuel mixtures are represented in this study: 1) one biogas fuel with 40 % CO 2 dilution; 2) four syngas fuels with CO 2 dilution; 3) three syngas fuels with 5 % CH 4 and 20 % CO 2 dilution; 4) two syngasmethane mixtures with CO 2 dilution. The analysis of the experimental results is divided into four sections, each one corresponding to a <b>fuel</b> <b>group.</b> Concerning the biogas with 40 % CO 2 dilution, it was seen that CH 4 depletion occured at a radial distance which corresponds to the the maximum concentration of H 2 O and the minimum concentration of O 2. The maximum temperature was located at the flame’s reaction boundary whereas much of the central axis of the flame was occupied by unburned reactants. The syngas mixtures with 25 % CO 2 dilution demonstrated that a decrease in H 2 /CO ratio causes a decrease in flame temperature due {{to an increase in}} radiative heat loss stemming from the additional CO 2 production. An increase in flame cone length, or a decrease in laminar burning velocity, was noted in conjunction with decreasing H 2 /CO ratio. Conversely, increasing H 2 /CO ratios coincide with higher levels of H 2 O production and shorter flame cones. CO 2 addition causes a decrease in flame size as well as a decrease in flame temperature. Regarding syngas mixtures with 5 % CH 4 and 20 % CO 2 dilution, the experimental results suggest that the CH 4 reacts and/or dissociates early, within the first 10 % of the flame’s visible height. It was shown that the height of flame cones decreased in conjunction with increasing H 2 /CO ratio, suggesting an increase in laminar burning velocity. The flames of methane-syngas mixtures with CO 2 dilution provided evidence of CH 4 dissociation early in the flame’s development since measured H 2 and CO concentrations increased slightly. It was noted that the maximum concentration of H 2 O occurred at the same radial location as the maximum temperature. In general, reaction boundaries of laminar, partially premixed flames of all syngas and biogas mixtures could be identified by a decrease in the concentrations of the unburned reactants and an increase in the concentrations of H 2 O and CO 2. The reaction boundary is also characterized by an increase in O 2 and N 2 concentrations. The flame temperature reduces to room temperature beyond this reaction boundary...|$|E
