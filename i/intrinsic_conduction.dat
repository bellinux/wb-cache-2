40|$|ObjectivesTo compare right {{ventricular}} (RV) activation during <b>intrinsic</b> <b>conduction</b> or pacing {{in heart}} failure (HF) patients. BackgroundRV activation during <b>intrinsic</b> <b>conduction</b> or pacing {{in patients with}} left ventricular (LV) dysfunction is unclear but may affect the prognosis. In cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT), timed LV pacing (CRT-LV) may be superior to biventricular pacing (CRT-BiV), and is hypothesized {{to be due to}} the merging of LV-paced and right bundle branch&#x 2013;mediated wavefronts, thus avoiding perturbation of RV electrical activation. MethodsEpicardial RV activation duration (RVAD) (onset to end of free wall activation) was evaluated noninvasively by electrocardiographic imaging in healthy control subjects (n = 7) and compared with that of HF patients (LV ejection fraction 23 &#x 00 B 1; 10 %, n = 14). RVAD in HF was contrasted during RV pacing, CRT-BiV, and CRT-LV at optimized AV intervals. ResultsDuring <b>intrinsic</b> <b>conduction</b> in HF (n = 12), the durations of QRS and precordial lead rS complexes were 158 &#x 00 B 1; 24 and 77 &#x 00 B 1; 17 ms, respectively, indicating delayed total ventricular depolarization but rapid initial myocardial activation. Echocardiography demonstrated no significant RV disease. RV epicardial voltage, activation patterns, and RVAD in HF did not differ from normal (RVAD 32 &#x 00 B 1; 15 vs. 28 &#x 00 B 1; 3 ms, respectively, p = 0. 42). In HF, RV pacing generated variable areas of slow conduction and prolonged RVAD (78 &#x 00 B 1; 33 ms, p &#x 003 C; 0. 001). RVAD remained delayed during CRT-BiV at optimized atrioventricular intervals (76 &#x 00 B 1; 32 ms, p = 0. 87). In contrast, CRT-LV reduced RVAD to 40 &#x 00 B 1; 26 ms (p &#x 003 C; 0. 016), comparable to <b>intrinsic</b> <b>conduction</b> (p = 0. 39) but not when atrioventricular conduction was poor or absent. ConclusionsIn HF patients without RV dysfunction treated with CRT, normal RV free wall activation in intrinsic rhythm indicated normal right bundle branch&#x 2013;mediated depolarization. However, the RV was vulnerable to the development of activation delays during RV pacing, whether alone or with CRT-BiV. These were avoided by CRT-LV in patients with normal atrioventricular conduction...|$|E

Previous studies have not shown reductions in mortality or stroke with rate-modulated dual-chamber (DDDR) pacing as compared to ventricular-based (VVI) pacing.

We investigated the role of fusing pacing-induced activation and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>conduction</b> in cardiac resynchronization therapy by evaluating the acute hemodynamic effects of simultaneous His-bundle (HIS) and left ventricular (LV) pacing. Methods and Results—We studied 11 patients with systolic heart failure and left bundle-branch block scheduled for cardiac resynchronization therapy implantation. On implantation, LV pressure–volume data were determined via conductance catheter. Standard leads {{were placed in the}} right atrium, at the right ventricular apex, and in a coronary vein. An additional electrode was temporarily positioned in the HIS. The following pacing configurations were systematically assessed: standard biventricular (right ventricular apex+LV), LV-only, HIS, simultaneous HIS and LV (HIS+LV). Each configuration was compared with the AAI mode at multiple atrioventricular delays (AVD). In comparison with the AAI, right ventricular apex+LV and LV-only pacing resulted in improved stroke volume (85 ± 32 mL and 86 ± 33 mL versus 58 ± 23 mL; P 76 mL at all fixed intervals and 88 ± 31 mL at optimal interval; all P< 0. 001).

The AV interval was varied in four steps starting (AV 1) with an AV interval 40 ms shorter than the intrinsic PQ time and decreased with 25 % for each step. ResultsAt AV 1, LVdP/dtmaxwas 996 ± 194 mm Hg/s for LV pacing and 960 ± 200 mm Hg/s for BiV pacing (p = 0. 0009), with all patients showing ventricular fusion during LV pacing. At AV 2, 21 patients had ventricular fusion with a LVdP/dtmaxof 983 ± 213 mm Hg/s and 957 ± 202 mm Hg/s for LV and BiV pacing, respectively.

A low biventricular pacing rate, for example, in cases with atrial fibrillation or rapid <b>intrinsic</b> atrioventricular (AV) <b>conduction,</b> decreases the benefits of CRT. The LUMAX HF-T 540 device series (BIOTRONIK, Berlin, Germany) has a LV-triggered pace algorithm, which allows biventicular pacing rates to be maintained even during rapid intrinsic rhythms caused by shortened AV conduction and/or premature ventricular contraction (PVC) occurring in the right ventricle. We encountered a case of CRT device implantation with a defibrillator wherein this triggered pace algorithm caused a spike on T-wave due to T-wave oversensing. By remote monitoring, we were also able to determine that the T-wave oversensing was due to a PVC. The LUMAX 540 series allows for changes in the sensing threshold and filter settings of the device, which facilitated the elimination of T-wave oversensing in this case...|$|R
40|$|Background Several {{studies have}} shown that {{unnecessary}} right ventricular pacing has detrimental effects. Objective To evaluate whether minimization of ventricular pacing as compared with standard dual-chamber pacing (DDD) improves clinical outcomes in patients referred for pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) replacement. Methods In an international single-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled trial, we compared DDD with managed ventricular pacing (MVP), a pacing mode developed to minimize ventricular pacing by promoting <b>intrinsic</b> atrioventricular <b>conduction.</b> We included patients referred for device replacement with > 40 % ventricular pacing, no cardiac resynchronization therapy upgrade indication, no permanent atrial fibrillation (AF), and no permanent complete atrioventricular block. Follow-up was for 2 years. The primary end point was cardiovascular hospitalization. The intention-to-treat analysis was performed by using Kaplan-Meier method and the log-rank test. Results We randomized 605 patients (556 referred for pacemaker and 49 referred for ICD replacement; mean age 75 ± 11 years; 365 [60 %] men, at 7. 7 ± 3. 3 years from first device implantation) to MVP (n = 299) or DDD (n = 306). We found no significant differences in the primary end point cardiovascular hospitalization (MVP: 16. 3 % vs DDD: 14. 5 %; P =. 72) and the secondary end point persistent AF (MVP: 15. 4 % vs DDD: 11. 2 %; P =. 08), permanent AF (MVP: 4. 1 % vs DDD: 3. 1 %; P =. 44), and composite of death and cardiovascular hospitalization (MVP: 23. 9 % vs DDD: 20. 2 %; P =. 48). MVP reduced right ventricular pacing (median 5 % vs 86 %; Wilcoxon, P 40 % ventricular pacing in the ventricle, a strategy to minimize ventricular pacing is not superior to standard DDD in reducing incidence of cardiovascular hospitalization...|$|R
40|$|Background:  Chronic right {{ventricular}} apical (RVA) pacing {{has been}} associated with increased risk of heart failure and adverse outcome. The acute effects of RVA pacing on three-dimensional (3 D) ventricular function and mechanical dyssynchrony are not well known. We performed a real-time 3 D echocardiographic (RT 3 DE) study to assess global and regional left ventricular function during RVA pacing. Methods:  Twenty-six patients with implanted cardiac devices and normal <b>intrinsic</b> atrioventricular <b>conduction</b> were included in the study. RT 3 DE was performed during intrinsic sinus rhythm and during RVA pacing. Quantification of global and regional left ventricular function was performed offline by time-volume analysis of 16 myocardial segments. Time to reach minimum regional volume was calculated for each segment {{as a percentage of the}} cardiac cycle. The systolic dyssynchrony index (SDI) was defined as the standard deviation of these time periods. Longitudinal function was assessed by time-volume analysis of apical, midventricular, and basal segments. Results:  During RVA pacing, a reversed apical-to-basal longitudinal contraction sequence was observed in 58 % of all patients. RVA pacing was associated with increased left ventricular (LV) dyssynchrony (SDI increase from 4. 4 ± 2. 2 % to 6. 3 ± 2. 4 %, P = 0. 001) and reduced LV ejection fraction (decrease from 53 ± 13 % to 47 ± 14 %, P = 0. 05). Conclusion:  RT 3 DE assessment of LV function provides evidence that pacing from the RVA results in acute alterations in LV contraction sequence and increased LV dyssynchrony. Further studies are warranted to assess the potential of RT 3 DE to identify patients who might be at increased risk of pacing-induced heart failure or who might benefit from alternate-site or multisite pacing.
