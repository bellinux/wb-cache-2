40|$|INTRODUCTION: One of the {{advantages}} of cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) is the possibility of obtaining images of conventional lateral cephalograms derived from partial or complete reconstruction of facial images. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed at comparing <b>full</b> <b>face,</b> right and left hemifacial CBCT cephalograms of orthodontic patients without clinical facial asymmetry. METHODS: The sample comprised nine clinically symmetrical patients who had pretreament <b>full</b> <b>face</b> CBCT. The CBCTs were reconstructed so as to obtain <b>full</b> <b>face,</b> right and left hemifacial cephalograms. Two observers, at two different times, obtained linear and angular measurements for the images using Dolphin 3 D software. Dependent and independent t-tests were used to assess the reproducibility of measurements. Analysis of Variance and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to compare the variables obtained in the CBCT derived cephalometric views. RESULTS: There was good reproducibility for CBCT scans and no statistically significant differences between measurements of <b>full</b> <b>face,</b> right and left hemifacial CBCT scans. CONCLUSIONS: Cephalometric measurements in <b>full</b> <b>face,</b> right and left hemifacial CBCT scans in clinically symmetrical patients are similar...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the identication and on the {{perception}} of facial action units displayed alone {{as well as the}} meaning decoding and the perception of <b>full</b> <b>face</b> synthesized expressions of laughter. We argue that the adequate representation of single action units is important in the decoding and the perception of the <b>full</b> <b>face</b> expressions. In particular we focus on three factors that may in uence the identication and the perception of single actions and <b>full</b> <b>face</b> expressions: their presentation mode (static vs. dynamic), their intensity, and the presence of wrinkles. For {{the purpose of this study}} we used a hybrid approach for animation synthesis that combines data-driven and procedural animations with synthesized wrinkles generated using a bump mapping method. Using such animation technique, we created animations of single action units and <b>full</b> <b>face</b> movements of two virtual characters. Next, we conducted two studies to evaluate the role of presentation mode, intensity and wrinkles in single actions and <b>full</b> <b>face</b> context-free expressions. Our evaluation results show that intensity and presentation mode in uence 1) the identication of single action units, 2) the perceived quality of the animation. At the same time, wrinkles 3) are useful in the identication of a single action unit and 4) in uence the perceived meaning attached to the animation of <b>full</b> <b>face</b> expressions. Thus, all factors are important for successful communication o...|$|R

A specific type of Zanni, Brighella, wore accents of green to indicate his tricky and devious nature.

The Zanni at first wore a <b>full</b> <b>faced</b> carnival mask, but because of the need for dialogue between Pantalone and the Zanni, the bottom of the mask was hinged and eventually cut away altogether.

50|$|Flat honing {{requires}} an exclusive wheel {{suitable for the}} type of material being processed. Flat honing wheels are available with <b>full</b> <b>faced</b> layers of abrasive although grooves of different geometry can be introduced to enhance a better removal of material. These abrasives are fixed onto a steel plate. For vitrified bonded flat honing wheels, round or hexagonal pellets are used and are fixed to the steel plate with a special adhesive. The spaces between the pellets or segments are used to reduce the contact between the workpiece and the abrasive wheel. They also cool and lubricate the process. All types of flat honing wheels can vary in grain concentration and grain size along the area of the wheel which results in an even wear over the complete wheel.|$|E

25|$|A <b>full</b> <b>face</b> mask {{is lighter}} and more {{comfortable}} for swimming than a helmet or band mask, and usually provides an improved field of vision, {{but it is not}} as secure, and does not provide the same level of protection as the heavier and more sturdily constructed equipment. The two types of equipment have different ranges of application. Most <b>full</b> <b>face</b> masks are adaptable for use with scuba or surface supply. The <b>full</b> <b>face</b> mask does not usually have a bailout block fitted, and this is usually attached to the diver's harness, with a single hose to supply the mask from main or bailout gas which is selected at the block. The strap arrangement for <b>full</b> <b>face</b> masks is usually quite secure, but not as secure as a bandmask or helmet, and it is possible for it to be dislodged in the water. However it is also quite practicable for a trained diver to replace and clear a <b>full</b> <b>face</b> mask under water without assistance, so this is more an inconvenience than a disaster unless the diver is rendered unconscious at the same time.|$|R
5000|$|Along with Alan Foster and Brian Lopes John Purse is {{credited}} with bringing back the full face helmet back into BMX in the Summer of 1996. The Full Face Helmet (Figure 1) has a rigid chin bar structure to protect the lower front half of the head. It {{had fallen out of}} fashion since the mid-1980s for BMX racing due in part with claims that it hindered the racer's vision. The fact that it also obscured the racer's face in magazine photos also may have had a role in its decline in popularity. By the mid-1980s the three quarter or [...] "open faced" [...] helmet were standard (Figure 2). For lower face protection a racer used a combination chin and mouthguard that strapped onto the bottom of the helmet called generically a [...] "Joffa". During this ten-year interim the only serious BMX riders who regularly used <b>full</b> <b>faced</b> helmets where ramp style freestyle riders and later dirt jumpers. Both of whom perform complicated trick maneuvers from significantly high altitudes off the ground, as much as 30 to 40 feet at times. Ironically, as full face helmets gained in popularity among racers, it declined among dirt jumpers (although ramp freestylers still used them). Dirt Jumpers and even some freestylers stopped wearing BMX helmets of any kind and started using skateboarding helmets that only protected the crown of the head; again for visibility reasons when doing stunts.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Nickel Chloride doped Glycine {{crystals}} {{were grown}} from aqueous solution by natural evaporation method. The grown crystals {{were subjected to}} thermal (TG-DTA), Di-electric studies and Microhardness analysis. The grown Nickel Chloride doped Glycine crystals {{were found to be}} highly transparent and <b>full</b> <b>faced.</b> From TGA/DTA curve, the crystals were thermally stable and there is an improvement in stability due to dopants added with Glycine. The dielectric properties are correlated with electro-optical properties of the crystals. Nickel Chloride doped Glycine has higher dielectric constant and low dielectric loss than pure Glycine. Glycine Nickel Chloride crystals have low micro hardness value than that of pure Glycine crystal. The crystals are soft substances. Thus, the grown crystals are useful in fabrication of optoelectronic devices.
