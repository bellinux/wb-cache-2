By the time the last boats had been recovered night had fallen, when a sudden <b>fogbank</b> descended, hiding the iceberg from view. Riou {{found himself in a}} dangerous situation. Somewhere to leeward lay a large mass of ice, concealed in the darkness and fog. He posted lookouts in the bows and rigging, and began to edge slowly forward. After sometime the danger seemed to be past, and the iceberg left behind, when at 9 o'clock a strange pale glow was reported by the lookout in the bows. Riou ordered the helm to turn hard a starboard, turning into the wind as a wall of ice higher than the ship's masts slid by along the side. It briefly appeared that the danger had been avoided, but as she passed by the Guardian struck an underwater projection with a sudden crash. Caught in a sudden gust of wind the ship reared up and swung about, driving the stern into the ice, smashing away the rudder, shattering her stern frame and tearing a large gash in the hull. Despite the seriousness of the situation Riou remained calm, using the sails to pull clear of the ice, and then taking stock of the damage.|$|E

Fearless soon disabled Mainzs rudder and she began slowly circling. The British ships ceased fire after her last gun ceased firing at 12:25, just as Cöln and Strassburg came into sight from the north.

50|$|The affair {{began with}} a mistake made by the German aviator Major Erich Hoenmanns, the fifty-two-year-old base {{commander}} of Loddenheide airfield, near Münster. On the morning of 10 January, he had been flying a Messerschmitt Bf 108 Taifun, an aircraft used for reconnaissance, liaison, and other miscellaneous roles, from Loddenheide to Cologne when he lost his way; extensive low <b>fogbanks</b> obscured {{his view of the}} landscape. In response he changed course to the west, hoping to regain his bearings by reaching the River Rhine. However, having already crossed over the frozen and indistinguishable Rhine at the moment he changed direction, he left German territory flying {{all the way to the}} River Meuse, the border in this area between Belgium and The Netherlands, and ended up circling Vucht.|$|R

60|$|The Capataz seized hold of {{the stern}} and blew with force. A queer, faint feeling had come over him while he swam. He had got rid of his boots and coat in the water. He hung on for a time, regaining his breath. In the {{distance}} the transports, more in a bunch now, held on straight for Sulaco, with their air of friendly contest, of nautical sport, of a regatta; and the united smoke of their funnels drove like a thin, sulphurous <b>fogbank</b> right over his head. It was his daring, his courage, his act that had set these ships in motion upon the sea, hurrying on to save the lives and fortunes of the Blancos, the taskmasters of the people; to save the San Tome mine; to save the children.|$|E
50|$|With Facility 9404-11 {{long since}} decommissioned, {{a brand new}} {{production}} facility was required. Delays arose during its construction, and in addition, engineers repeatedly encountered failure {{in their efforts to}} produce <b>FOGBANK.</b> As one deadline after the other expired, and the schedule was pushed back again and again, the NNSA eventually decided to invest $23 million to attempt to find an alternative to <b>FOGBANK.</b>|$|E
5000|$|It {{was soon}} {{realized}} that the <b>FOGBANK</b> material was a potential source of problems for the program, as few records of its manufacturing process had been retained when it was originally manufactured in the 1980s, and nearly all staff members who had expertise in its production had either retired or left the agency. The NNSA briefly investigated sourcing a substitute for <b>FOGBANK,</b> but eventually decided that since <b>FOGBANK</b> had been produced previously, {{they would be able}} to repeat it. Additionally, [...] "Los Alamos computer simulations at that time were not sophisticated enough to determine conclusively that an alternate material would function as effectively as Fogbank," [...] according to a Los Alamos publication.|$|E

50|$|<b>FOGBANK</b> is a {{code name}} {{given to a}} {{material}} used in nuclear weapons such as the W76, W78 and W80.|$|E
50|$|It {{has been}} {{revealed}} by unclassified official sources that <b>FOGBANK</b> was originally manufactured in Facility 9404-11 of the Y-12 National Security Complex in Oak Ridge, Tennessee from 1975 until 1989, {{when the final}} batch of W76 warheads were completed. After that the facility was mothballed, and finally slated for decommissioning by 1993. Only a small pilot plant was left, which {{had been used to}} produce small batches of <b>FOGBANK</b> for testing purposes.|$|E
5000|$|However National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) Administrator Tom D’Agostino {{disclosed}} {{the role}} of <b>FOGBANK</b> in the weapon: [...] "There's another material in the—it's called interstage material, also known as fog bank", and arms experts believe that <b>FOGBANK</b> is an aerogel material which acts as an interstage material in a nuclear warhead; i.e., a material designed to become a superheated plasma following the detonation of the weapon's fission stage, the plasma then triggering the fusion-stage detonation.|$|E
5000|$|In March 2007, {{engineers}} finally {{devised a}} manufacturing process for <b>FOGBANK.</b> Unfortunately, the material {{turned out to}} have problems when tested, and in September 2007 the <b>FOGBANK</b> project was upgraded to [...] "Code Blue" [...] status by the NNSA, making it a major priority. In 2008, following the expenditure of a further $69 million, the NNSA finally managed to manufacture <b>FOGBANK,</b> and 7 months later, the first refurbished warhead was handed over to the US Navy, nearly a decade after the commencement of the refurbishment program. However, in May 2009 a US Navy spokesman said that they had not received any refurbished weapons to date. The Energy Department stated that the current plan was to begin shipping refurbished weapons in the fall of 2009, two years behind schedule.|$|E

50|$|As {{a result}} of {{exposure}} to the mutagenic effects of a <b>fogbank</b> of unknown nature, Stanley Stewart possesses superhuman speed, stamina, and reflexes. When moving at subsonic speed, the Stewart Whizzer can create cyclones (by running in circles); run up walls and across water. The character has limited immunity to the effects of friction (Stewart wears goggles to protect his eyes), although still generates normal fatigue poisons. As a result, Stewart must consume large amounts of calories and rest after using his superhuman speed powers extensively.|$|E

5000|$|Evidence {{supporting}} {{the idea that}} warheads could be [...] "hardened" [...] against the effects of ablation generated shock waves, exists in the two lethal ranges stated for the W71, which had a lethal exo-atmospheric radius of 12 miles km against warheads without countermeasures, but as little as 4 miles km against warheads that did. Although the systems used to counter these attacks remain secret, some details have become public over time. US warheads are known to use aerogel in their structure, a system known as <b>FOGBANK,</b> {{but it is not}} clear if this is used to deaden the shockwave or for other purposes.|$|E
50|$|The {{experience}} of reverse engineering <b>FOGBANK</b> produced some improvements in scientific {{knowledge of the}} process. The new production scientists noticed that certain problems in production resembled those noted by the original team. These problems were traced to a particular impurity in the final product that was required to meet quality standards. A root cause investigation showed that input materials were subject to cleaning processes that had not existed during the original production run. This cleaning removed a substance that generated the required impurity. With the implicit role of this substance finally understood, the production scientists can control output quality better than during the original run.|$|E

The fog was so dense that the intense glow of the burning plane could not be seen by attendants on the field. Lt. N. M. Ostergren, U. S. Navy, was found dead at his crashed plane near McDavid the next morning. Officers said the wreckage of the eight planes - they declined to estimate their worth, but aviation circles here said the fast combat ships would cost from $18,000 to $20,000 each - was the air station's second heaviest loss.

Despite the seriousness of the situation, Riou remained calm, using the sails to pull clear of the ice, and then taking stock of the damage.Now clear of the immediate danger of the ice, Riou found himself in a desperate situation. There was two feet of water in the hold and more was rushing in, while the sea was rising and a gale had sprung up. The pumps were manned, but could not keep up with the influx of water, and by midnight there was 6 feet of water in the hold. At dawn on Christmas Day, an attempt was made to fother the hull, which involved lowering an oakum-packed studding sail over the side to cover the gash in the hull and slow the flooding. This was temporarily successful and by 11 o'clock the pumps had been able to reduce the water to a level of 19 inches. The respite was short-lived, as the sail split under the pressure of the water and the water level began to rise again. A number of seaman requested permission to take to the ship's boats. Riou convinced them to stay, but another attempt to fother the hull with another sail failed when the sail immediately ripped. By nightfall on 25 December, the water in the hold had risen to 7 feet, and the ship was rolling violently, allowing water to pour over the ship's side. Riou ordered the stores, guns and livestock to be thrown overboard in an attempt to lighten the ship, but was injured when his hand was crushed by a falling cask while trying to clear the bread-room. By morning the next day, the ship was settling by the stern, while the sails had been torn away in the gale. Again the seamen, this time joined by the convicts, requested to be allowed to take to the boats. Riou at last agreed to this, well aware that there were not enough boats for everyone, and announced 'As for me, I have determined to remain in the ship, and shall endeavour to make my presence useful {{as long as there is}} any occasion for it.' ...|$|E
