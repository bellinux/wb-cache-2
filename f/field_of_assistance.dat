Following {{in the footsteps of}} Queen Olga, she led various initiatives in the field of education, soup kitchens and development of hospitals and orphanages. In 1896, the Crown Princess also founded the Union of Greek Women, a particularly active organization in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> to refugees from the Ottoman Empire. Fascinated by arboriculture and concerned by the fires that regularly ravaged the country, Sophia was also interested in the reforestation. In addition, {{she was one of the}} founders of the Greek Animal Protection Society.However, it was during the wars that Greece suffered during late 19th early 20th century that Sophie showed the most social activity. In 1897 and at the outbreak of the Thirty Days' War against the Ottomans about the possession of Crete which ended with a humiliating Greek defeat, Sophia and other female members of the royal family actively worked with the Greek Red Cross in order to help wounded soldiers. In the thessalian front, the Crown Princess founded field hospitals, visited the wounded and even directly administered care for victims of the fighting. Sophia also facilitated the arrival of English nurses in Greece and even participated in the training of young women volunteers to provide assistance to wounded soldiers.|$|E

Then, we analyse the shortcomings of these systems, and thus explain what additional features new devices could offer. To study the feasibility of such systems, we tackle the different issues raised in the process: localizing users, modeling their environment and adding semantic annotations.

40|$|Under the {{impression}} of an increasing demand for sustainability thinking in the building and construction sector, the method of Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is constantly gaining relevance. LCA is a method to quantify and assess {{the environmental impacts of}} technical systems - in the building and construction sector, these could be both, building products or complete buildings - over their entire life cycle. In the construction sector, LCAs of building products have been well established, while LCAs of entire buildings are just now becoming more common. The German certificate for sustainable buildings strongly promotes this development by including Life Cycle Thinking into the rating of the sustainability of buildings. Due to this development, planners and other stakeholders in the construction industry have to face the necessity of life cycle based environmental optimization of a building already during the planning phase of the building. With the cooperation of LCA experts and experts in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> in the planning and construction process, dedicated and feasible solutions for this task can be developed.

40|$|The chosen {{topic for}} this MastersThesis is "Assistance to Victims of Crime" - {{primarily}} due to its growing social significance. Society as a whole should not {{turn a blind eye}} to the serious impact of crime, focusing only on the punishment of convicted criminals; it should also focus on assistance to those harmed and affected by crime. Criminals usually commit crimes with a strong conscious awareness of their misbehaviour, while victims have no similar expectation; for them, a criminal event is like something "out of the blue". The shocking and traumatic impact following the crime, is something unbelievable for one who never had such an experience; hence, the return back to normal life is often very difficult for victims of crime. A society which aspires to be modern and developed should make this return as easy as possible, implementing a series of measures in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance.</b> My goal was to describe the possibilities which exist in this area but also to concentrate on the current legislation, especially on new rights being brought into practice by the new Victims of Crime Assistance Act No 45 / 2013 Coll.

40|$|Given {{the changes}} that have {{occurred}} within the demographic structure of the population and the framework of the labour market, there is a both a global and national concern towards the continuous reconceptualization of the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance.</b> Although during the last decades our country's political and economic maps have innately influenced social practices, the social assistance system in Romania is still in transition. The aim of the present study is to progressively undertake a critical review of the circumstances that have {{led to the development of}} the national social assistance system so that the specific advantages and disadvantages of current practices and characteristics be identified. Such aspects are to serve as basis for the opposite forecast of the opportunities and challenges that the Romanian social assistance system is to face, with a direct and subsequent impact upon the choice of tools for an optimal social intervention that is to generate social welfare. Thus, while Romania's concern for social issues has seen no intermission, as it continuously sought the satisfaction of the more and more diverse social needs and expectations, its accession to the European Union and the later requirements imposed by the need to align to the standards imposed by European superstructures have lead the way to new accumulations in terms of social policy, with a resolute impact upon its major objectives and expected aims. In this context, the transition from passive to active social practices seeks to ensure the overall transformation of the system, a basis for a sound investment in human capital...|$|E

40|$|AbstractFor over 40 years {{science in}} a variety of domains has {{conducted}} an impressive amount of research in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> and automation concepts, which apply human factors and needs in the design stage of cooperative and cognitive technical systems. Cooperative automation is an approach that tries to keep the user in the control loop by means of a continuous interaction during task execution. Cooperative automation aims to support the harmonization of the actor's activities (user and automation) in a human-machine-system. To enable this, both the internal (processing and computation) and external (communications and interfaces) design of the automation has to be compatible with human competence. This contribution addresses the key features of cooperative automation. These features have been used for creating a design space, which can be used as method repository in order to develop assistance systems based on the cognitive capabilities of the human. The key elements are represented as dimensions of the design space. Corresponding theories and methods are discussed. The design process for a cognitive and cooperative assistance system based on the dimensions of the design space are described. The developed Cognitive and Cooperative Assistance System (COGAS), has been implemented in the domain of air target identification on German naval ships. An evaluation of COGAS has been conducted with naval operators in order to verify its operability and to optimize and extend the COGAS functionality. The results show that COGAS improves the operator's performance in terms of increasing the amount of correct decisions and accelerating the identification process without increasing the operator's stress level. In addition it was found that COGAS helps to enhance the situational awareness due to the workload optimization...|$|E
40|$|Domestic {{violence}} in Czech Republic {{has been for}} a long time and unnamed taboo. In the 1990 's it came to legislative changes, none-profit organizations interested in this phenomenon were established and they started to promote this issue among the general public. Nowadays there is growing an intensive need that forces us to explore domestic {{violence in}} our country. The aim of the study was to ascertain the availability of social services for victims of domestic violence according to the opinion of social workers. There was used a qualitative research strategy. Data collection was conducted through semi-structured interviews with six social workers, who were selected by an intentional (purposeful) choice, and who all work in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> to victims of domestic violence. The theoretical part introduces the basic concepts related to domestic violence, its character, forms, reasons, the course of domestic violence, the typical profile of the offender and the victim. In the next section I focused on the legal framework, which is valid for the Czech Republic. One chapter is devoted to social services providing their assistance to victims of domestic violence. In the last chapter there are social services concretized to those, operating in České Budějovice. The practical part describes the results of qualitative research, based on individual case studies located in the appendix of work. Thanks to compiled research results there was an opportunity to look into the issue of assistance provided to victims of domestic violence in the regional capital city of České Budějovice, and find out whether this service offer meets the demand of the clients who use them. The results show what kind of various services organizations offer to its clients, in which catchment area, in what form and how many clients are they able to take. Research also showed that the offer of social services for the city of České Budějovice is sufficient, but according to respondents, there are still things to be improved. There is an option to contact a number of organizations providing assistance to victims of domestic violence. However, this situation is not as positive in the smaller towns of the South Bohemian Region. The work could, in my opinion, contribute to greater public awareness about service provided for victims of domestic violence...|$|E

The place and time of formation, titles, the field of work of the teachers and the classification of the periodicals were also analyzed. Criteria from QUALIS/CAPES – the national program for the qualification of higher education professionals, were used for the classification of the publications. The data was collected from Curricula Lattes where there was a data base of 183 publications edited in 51 periodicals, out of those, 56, 9 % were in the theme of organization, 31, 14 % in the <b>field</b> <b>of</b> <b>assistance</b> and 12, 02 % with the profession theme. As far as classification of the QUALIS/CAPES is concerned, out of 51 means of publication, 33 of them fit into categories A to C, most of them published at the national level only. The analysis revealed that the predominance of teachers in the nursing department at UEL have an investigative profile in the organizational field and also suggested future researches in less explored fields in order to strengthen this professional group. O objetivo desse estudo foi analisar e classificar a direcionalidade temática e as linhas de pesquisa das publicações feitas pelos docentes do curso de enfermagem da Universidade Estadual de Londrina-PR (UEL) no período de 1995 a 2006.
