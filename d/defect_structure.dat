However, zinc selenide and zinc telluride are both coloured due to charge-transfer processes. Zinc oxide turns yellow when heated due {{to the loss of}} some oxygen atoms and formation of a <b>defect</b> <b>structure.</b> Compounds containing zinc are typically diamagnetic, except in cases where the ligand is a radical.|$|E

The three-dimensional photonic crystal template was fabricated through prism-based holographic lithography. <b>Defect</b> <b>structures</b> are fabricated through the two-photon polymerization excited by a femtosecond laser. The strengths of two optical lithographic techniques are combined with holographic lithography providing a rapid and large area microfabrication and two-photon lithography providing flexibility in fabrication of <b>defect</b> <b>structures.</b> The optical fabrication process is simplified in the negative tone DPHPA without prebake and postexposure bake as is required of SU- 8 while maintaining a capability for constructing photonic structures with small features. © 2010 American Institute of Physics...|$|R

The crystal has a full photonic band gap from 89. 6 to 99. 8 GHz. By removing material from the crystals, millimeter wave <b>defect</b> <b>structures</b> have been created and localized defect modes observed.

Rock magnetism provides non-destructive methods for analyzing these minerals such as magnetic hysteresis measurements, temperature-dependent remanence measurements, Mössbauer spectroscopy, ferromagnetic resonance and so on. With such methods, rock magnetists can measure the effects of past climate change and human impacts on the mineralogy (see environmental magnetism). In sediments, {{a lot of the}} magnetic remanence is carried by minerals that were created by magnetotactic bacteria, so rock magnetists have made significant contributions to biomagnetism.|$|E

The findings became known as [...] "The Zeigarnik Effect". Shortly after her finding of the Zeigarnik Effect, she began work at the Institute of Higher Nervous Activity, where she was also influenced by the psychologist Vygotsky, becoming a part of his science research activities. Zeigarnik work provided great service to her country and as a pathophysiology, she established the use of her work in medical care, specifically in clinical work. Zeigarnik's copious experience helped her present the stages of development of Russian Psychology. Her work had a clinical focus which helped psychiatric health professionals focus their attention on mental health issues. In addition, she continued to teach and concentrated on the importance of mental health and clinical practice. Later, Zeigarnik concluded that the importance of taking personality assessment of the patient's psychological state and general understanding of their <b>defect</b> <b>structure</b> was key. Zeigarnik stated that, [...] "Any problem suggested by psychiatric practice, whether it concerns the examination of disability, or the study of the structure of remission, or the effectiveness of treatment - the data of psychological study comes useful only at once, when and where they suggest a qualification of the whole personality rather than a certain mental process".|$|E

40|$|The {{combination}} of Synchrotron White Beam X-ray Topography (SWBXT) and High Resolution Triple Crystal X-ray Diffractometry (HRTXD) {{has been used}} to non-destructively diagnose <b>defect</b> <b>structures</b> in single crystals grown in both microgravity and ground-based environments. Due to the fact that SWBXT is the superior technique for the characterization of defects in highly perfect regions and HRTXD is superior for highly imperfect regions, the {{combination of}} these two complementary techniques can provide a sensitive and useful tool to quantitatively analyze <b>defect</b> <b>structures.</b> Microgravity grown CdZnTe and ground-based grown ZnSe and ZnTe have been studied using this combination of techniques. The analysis from CdZnTe crystals revealed that the <b>defect</b> <b>structures</b> were dependent on the local cooling rates, the lower defect density regions being obtained at the slower cooling rates. SWBXT studies on ZnTe revealed a cellular structure of dislocations while HRTXD analysis revealed multiple surface streaks, which indicated mosaic blocks separated by small misorientations. Studies on the surface quality of ZnSe crystals revealed similar results from both SWBXT and HRTXD. This study indicates that SWBXT and HRTXD analytical results can not only be correlated but can also provide a complementary view of <b>defect</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

40|$|A B S TRACT: Until recently, the {{determination}} f the defect structures (previously referred to incorrectly as "crystallinity') ofkaolinites has been obtained {{in one of}} two ways: (l) measurement of the Hinckley index, or (2) by comparing calculated X-ray diffraction patterns based on a model of the <b>defect</b> <b>structure</b> (including types of defects and abundances) with experimental diffraction profiles. The Hinckley method is simple and easy to perform but contains no real information about he <b>defect</b> <b>structure.</b> Calculated XRD patterns are based on real defects but these calculations are time consuming and require some skill in application. Another approach isproposed: an expert system which will accurately describe the <b>defect</b> <b>structure</b> of kaolinites based on a few measurements taken from a normal powder diffraction profile. This system has been verified for nine kaolinite samples for which the <b>defect</b> <b>structure</b> was previously determined by comparison of calculated and observed diffraction profiles. The expert system reproduced the correct <b>defect</b> <b>structure</b> for each of the samples. The crystal structures of kaolinite samples have been studied for the last forty years in an attempt to determine, first qualitatively, and later more quantitatively, the types of defects and the abundances of these defects.

40|$|We {{systematically}} {{investigated the}} electronic structure of Ru nanoparticles supported on various local structures on reduced graphene oxide (rGO) by first-principles-based calculations. We showed that Ru nanoparticles prefer to nucleate at these localized <b>defect</b> <b>structures</b> on rGO, which act as strong trapping sites for Ru nanoparticles and inhibit their aggregation. The binding of Ru nanoparticles to rGO, which {{is dependent on}} these local <b>defect</b> <b>structures</b> and correlates with the interfacial charge transfer, determines the electronic structure of the composites. Further study reveals that the performance of these composites against oxygen adsorption changes proportionally with the shift of the d-band center of the nanoparticles. The correlation between the <b>defect</b> <b>structures</b> on rGO and the reactivity of the composites suggests that controlled modification of the graphenic support by defect engineering would be {{an efficient way to}} fabricate new transition metal/rGO composites with high stability and desired reactivity.

However, transport measurements reveal the crucial role of defect-induced electronic states, pointing out the fundamental importance of characterizing their intrinsic <b>defect</b> <b>structure.</b> Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) is able to image atomic scale defects in MoS 2 single layers, but the imaged <b>defect</b> <b>structure</b> {{is far from the}} one probed in the electronic devices, as the defect density and distribution are substantially altered during the TEM imaging.
