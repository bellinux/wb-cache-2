40|$|The modular {{drive system}} has an electromechanical/hydromechanical drive (5) for {{generating}} a rotary input motion, and a brake unit (6) for braking the generated rotary input motion. A gearbox is arranged in housing (1) for {{conversion of the}} rotary input motion into translational output movement. The housing is equipped with <b>input</b> <b>flange</b> surface (2 - 1) attached to electromechanical/hydromechanical drive, and output flange surface (3 - 1) attached to shaping machine. An independent claim is included for a shaping machine...|$|E
40|$|A novel maser {{concept is}} {{outlined}} and a unique design described which permits wide bandwidth and waveguide tuning range by employing four stages cascaded via cryogenically cooled circulators. Theoretical considerations for gain, bandwidth, gain ripple, and noise temperature are included. Operated on a closed-cycle helium refrigerator with a superconducting persistence-mode magnet, the four-stage amplifier is tunable from 18. 3 to 26. 6 GHz with 30 dB of net gain and achieves 240 MHz of 3 -dB bandwidth {{near the center}} of this band. The measured noise temperature is 13 + or - 2 K referred to the room-temperature <b>input</b> <b>flange.</b> Applications are foreseen utilizing cooled parametric downconverters and upconverters with this amplifier at IF to extend the low-noise performance up to millimeter frequencies and down to L-band for radio astronomy and planetary spacecraft communications...|$|E
40|$|A {{cryogenic}} cooled, low-noise Field Effect Transistor (FET) amplifier assembly for use at 2. 2 to 2. 3 GHz {{was developed}} for the DSN {{to meet the requirements}} of a Very Long Baseline Interferometry (VLBI) upgrade. An amplifier assembly was developed at JPL that uses a commercial closed-cycle helium refrigerator (CCR) to cool a FET amplifier to an operating temperature of 15 K. A cooled probe waveguide-to-coaxial transition similar to that used in the research and development Ultra-Low-Noise S-band Traveling Wave Maser (TWM) is used to minimize input line losses. Typical performance includes an <b>input</b> <b>flange</b> equivalent noise contribution of 14. 5 K, a gain slope of less than 0. 05 dB/MHz across a bandwidth of 2. 2 to 2. 3 GHz, an input VSWR of 1. 5 : 1 at 2. 25 GHz, and an insertion gain of 45 + or - 1 dB across the bandwidth of 2. 2 to 2. 3 GHz. Three 2. 3 GHz FET/CCR assemblies were delivered to the DSN in the spring of 1987...|$|E
40|$|In the APS {{storage ring}} cavities, {{magnetic}} loop type input couplers are used. The loaded Q of a cavity varies as the beam loading changes. The beam loading changes the cavity input impedance. Therefore, the input coupler must {{be adjusted to}} maintain a good impedance match. Measurements {{have been made to}} determine the coupler loop position (depth of penetration) with respect to various loading conditions in a storage ring single-cell cavity. An input coupler was inserted into the storage ring single-cell cavity at various loaded Q points, then matched. The relationship between the coupling coefficient, {Beta}, and the gap width, where gap width is the separation between the <b>input</b> coupler <b>flange</b> and the cavity port flange, was studied. A coupling coefficient is defined where Q{sub O} is the unloaded Q and Q{sub L} is the loaded Q, repectively. Depending on the extent of deQing of the fundamental mode in the single-cell cavity, the input coupler was positioned further in or out of the cavity accordingly to achieve matching at 50 {Omega}. Damping the cavity simulates the beam loading when the beam passes through the single-cell cavities...|$|R
50|$|The TACR2 {{was built}} on the Carmichael Commando chassis. This is a 775mm (30.5inch) six-wheeled rear {{extension}} of the classic Range Rover. It uses the Range Rover drivetrain, with the two leading axles (front axle and original rear axle) powered through the Range Rover permanent four wheel drive transfer case. The new rear axle is an unpowered trailer, using similar coil spring suspension. The chassis was converted by Carmichael from a standard Range Rover chassis supplied by Land Rover {{in the form of a}} drivable chassis cab, therefore most components were standard Range Rover. Some TACR2s have been converted to six wheel drive. This is usually achieved by welding an <b>input</b> cone mounting <b>flange</b> to the rear of the middle axle in place of the diff pan, attaching a second, rearward facing 'input' cone (as an output cone), linked by a short prop to the input cone of the rear axle, this and the diff and diff pan need to be turned over (so the crown wheel is on the opposite side to the middle axle's crown wheel) to maintain correct rotation. This should be used in conjunction with free wheeling hubs to prevent diff wind-up when driving on-road or tarmac.|$|R
