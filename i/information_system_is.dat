40|$|AbstractIn {{this paper}} we generalise {{the notion of}} (algebraic) <b>information</b> <b>system</b> to {{continuous}} <b>information</b> <b>system.</b> Just as algebraic <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> concrete representations of Scott domains, continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> <b>are</b> concrete representations of continuous Scott domains. The class of continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> can <b>be</b> generated from the subclass of qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems,</b> {{in the sense that}} the category of continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> <b>is</b> equivalent to the Karoubi envelope of the category of qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> Because qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> correspond to the qualitative domains of Girard (Theoret. Comput. Sci. 45, 159 - 192 (1986)) this implies that the category of continuous Scott domains is equivalent to the Karoubi envelope of the category of qualitative domains. We show how constructions on qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> (such as product and function space) can be "translated" to constructions on continuous <b>information</b> <b>systems.</b> Among other things, we prove that the category of qualitative <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> <b>is</b> weak Cartesian closed.

40|$|In this essay, {{a general}} case of <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> {{contains}} quantum <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> <b>is</b> considered.
