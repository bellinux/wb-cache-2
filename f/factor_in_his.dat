5|$|At the time, {{immunology}} {{was becoming}} more sophisticated, with the increasing role of molecular biology and biochemistry. Burnet was suspicious of {{the direction in which}} immunology was headed, and the increasing emphasis on technology and more intricate experiments, and colleagues felt that Burnet's conservative attitude was a <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> decision to turn the institute's focus to immunology.|$|E
5|$|Benn and {{his wife}} Caroline became {{vegetarian}} in 1970, for ethical reasons, and remained so {{for the rest of}} their lives. Benn cited the decision of his son Hilary to become vegetarian as an important <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own decision to adopt a vegetarian diet.|$|E

5|$|In May 2003, The New York Times {{reporter}} Jayson Blair {{was forced}} to resign from the newspaper after he was caught plagiarizing and fabricating elements of his stories.

5|$|Diệm deposed head {{of state}} Bảo Đại in a {{fraudulent}} referendum in 1955 and proclaimed himself president of the newly created Republic of Vietnam (commonly known as South Vietnam). The VNA thus became the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). Born into a nominally Buddhist family, Đính had converted to Catholicism {{in the hope of}} advancing his career. The change of religion was widely perceived to be a <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> rapid promotion above more capable officers. A devout member of the Catholic minority, Diệm dedicated the country to the Virgin Mary and heavily disenfranchised and disadvantaged the Buddhist majority.|$|E
5|$|He is {{predominantly}} a left footed player. During a match he will often drift {{to the left}} wing, with his teammate, {{in the case of}} Bayern Munich, Franck Ribéry, switching over to the right. Another <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> playing style is his relationship with the right-fullback. At Bayern, this partnership with Philipp Lahm has had benefits for the team's efficiency and chemistry. Robben's defensive work improved when he went to Bayern where he often tracks back and covers for his partner when he pushes forward and becomes a temporary right back.|$|E

5|$|Irwin owned {{athletic}} {{facilities in}} Atlantic City, New Jersey, and negotiated with baseball officials about bringing organized baseball there in 1900. Irwin opened a motor-paced bicycle racing {{track in the}} city in July 1902.

He also became involved with the Hartford Avenue Colosseum Company and oversaw its Philadelphia bicycle track.|$|E
5|$|Stewart {{returned}} to New Zealand in late 1941 {{to take up}} an appointment as deputy chief of staff, firstly under Major General John Duigan and then Lieutenant General Edward Puttick.

5|$|The governor's {{relationship}} with the General Assembly has typically been the determining <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> success at enacting his agenda, although other factors also play an important role. In most of Indiana's history, the governor has come to power {{at a time in}} which his party controlled the assembly. Since the political parties first became dominant in 1831 and until 2010, thirty-three sessions of the legislature have been divided with different parties controlling the House and Senate. Only five sessions have occurred where the legislature was entirely controlled by the opposition party, while in ninety-eight sessions the governor's party controlled the entire assembly.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityThe {{problem of}} this {{dissertation}} {{is to determine}} the place of teleology in the thought of Charles Augustus Strong: his use and recognition of teleological factors. The method chosen to implement the investigation is a critical examination of the development of Strong's epistemology and metaphysi cs in terms of their respective priority, agreement, relative critical depth, and of Strong's use of teleological <b>factors</b> <b>in</b> the development of his metaphysics and epistemology. 	Special consideration is given to Strong's emphasis on animal faith and related purposive <b>factors</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> epistemology [...] an emphasis which stands side by side with Strong's denial of teleological <b>factors</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> metaphysics. Particular attention is also given to the mind-body problem, since Strong focused much of his labor on the mind-body problem and the origin and function of consciousness as a natural product of evolution...|$|R
5|$|After the Council of Westminster, Hilary {{supported}} the king throughout the Becket dispute, and one <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> royalist position {{may have been}} that Hilary remembered who had opposed his case against Battle Abbey, and thus refused to support the archbishop. Towards the end of 1163, Henry sent Hilary on an embassy to Becket, to persuade the archbishop to modify his position, but Becket was unmoved. Hilary also {{took part in the}} king's embassy in 1164 to Pope Alexander III and King Louis VII of France, which attempted to persuade the pope and the king of France to favour King Henry instead of Becket, and to keep Becket from finding a haven in France during his exile.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2007 season, Alston {{competed with}} Ron Warner and Jabari Issa for a {{starting}} {{role on the}} Eskimos. He made the active roster and originally split time with Warner and Robert Brown as a defensive lineman. In August, Alston replaced Adam Braidwood as the starting defensive end, but he was injured with a hip pointer {{in his first game}} in that role. He experienced nagging injury concerns {{for the remainder of the}} season. He finished the season with 11 tackles, a sack, and a forced fumble over six games. The Eskimos released Alston shortly after the end of the 2007. Head coach Danny Maciocia cited Alston's history of injuries as a <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> release from the team.|$|E
5|$|Between 1974 and 1977, Boycott {{elected to}} make himself {{unavailable}} for England. He claimed in 2006 that he had simply lost his appetite for Test cricket and the stress became too much for him. Boycott's biographer, McKinstry, speculates that the self-imposed exile {{may also have been}} linked to the appointments of Mike Denness and then Tony Greig to the England captaincy, in preference to Boycott. Boycott was very critical of Denness's captaincy and his standard of batting in his autobiography in 1987, citing it as a <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> decision, along with the pressures at Yorkshire. His weak immune system was a recurring motivation for not touring the Indian subcontinent. This period of exile coincided with the peaks of several fast bowlers' careers, including Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson, Andy Roberts, and Michael Holding. However, he later came back to face the West Indies pace battery at its most fearsome in the late 70s and early 80s.|$|E
25|$|In 1928, Al Smith {{became the}} first Roman Catholic to gain a major party's {{nomination}} for President.

50|$|While Attorney General, Kelley ran for {{election}} to the U.S. Senate in 1972, but lost to incumbent Robert P. Griffin.

5|$|Brashear was {{not given}} an {{extension}} during the season, and {{prior to the start}} of the free agency he indicated that he would like to return to Washington, citing the prospect of winning a Stanley Cup. Brashear noted that at his age and place in his career, taking care of his family was his top priority and that money would be the deciding <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> destination. The Capitals, however, opted not re-sign him. After initial talks with the Kontinental Hockey League (KHL)'s Vityaz Chekhov, he eventually agreed to a two-year, $2.8 million contract with the New York Rangers. At an event for season-ticket holders, Brashear was booed due to the altercation with the Rangers in the previous post-season. He set a personal milestone during the 2009–10 season by playing in his 1,000th NHL game on November 12 against the Atlanta Thrashers.|$|E
5|$|However, Hornsby {{was often}} {{hard to get}} along with, a major reason he changed teams so {{frequently}} {{in the last decade}} of his career. He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won. His gambling was often a <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> dismissal from a team. By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. He never went to movies or read books, convinced that it would harm a batter's eyesight, and he never smoked or drank.|$|E
5|$|In January 2010, Gill was {{appointed}} manager of Weymouth, then {{bottom of the}} Conference South. With the club already in financial difficulty, many first-team players left. Budgetary constraints meant Gill was unable to bring in replacements, and after 44 days in post, he resigned, feeling the job had become untenable. Weymouth's chairman claimed the cost of travelling from his Midlands home was a <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> departure, a suggestion that Gill refuted. In mid-2010, he joined Bristol Rovers as youth team coach. He led the team to {{the third round of}} the FA Youth Cup, in which they lost narrowly to Aston Villa's youth team, before a management restructure at the club resulted in his departure.|$|E
50|$|Dawit {{claimed that}} he had {{reasonable}} grounds to flee but, in hindsight, they were not insurmountable and he should have stayed at home.

50|$|Even as a teenager, the Italian born {{photographer}} {{who spent his}} 20s and 30s primarily based in Sweden, noted that he preferred fantasy to the trials of real life.

5|$|In July 2008, {{speculation}} {{began on}} what Hunt would do past the expiration {{of his contract}} {{at the end of}} the 2009 season. With some high-profile defections of star league players to cashed-up rugby union clubs from France, Hunt is expected to be the target of offers from overseas and within Australia. Australian rugby union club Queensland Reds stated their intentions to attempt to lure Hunt to the rugby union code, with the reasoning being his successful young career in rugby union. From within the NRL competition, Sydney based clubs Sydney Roosters and St. George Illawarra Dragons stated their intentions to make a bid for Hunt for his services in the 2010 season, claiming they could double Hunt's three-year deal from 2006, reported to be around $200,000. The Broncos however, were still expected to be a <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> decision with the possibility of the captaincy a possible lure to remain with the Broncos.|$|E
5|$|In October 1946 David Lilienthal asked Bacher {{to become}} one of the inaugural commissioners of the United States Atomic Energy Commission, the {{civilian}} agency that was being formed to replace the wartime Manhattan Project. As a Republican, Bacher was easily confirmed by the Senate members of the United States Congress Joint Committee on Atomic Energy by an 8–0 vote. As he was the only one of the five commissioners who was a scientist—an important <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> decision to accept the post—he played a leading role in the selection of the Atomic Energy Commission's influential General Advisory Committee to which nine scientists were appointed: James Conant, Lee DuBridge, Enrico Fermi, Robert Oppenheimer, Isidor Isaac Rabi, Hartley Rowe, Glenn Seaborg, Cyril Smith and Hood Worthington.|$|E
5|$|Incest and {{intersex}} {{is another}} theme in Middlesex. Eugenides examines the passionate feelings that siblings living in seclusion experience for each other. Milton and Tessie, second cousins, are conceived {{during the same}} night, hinting to the incest of Desdemona and Lefty. Desdemona and Lefty's incestuous relationship is a transgression of a powerful taboo, indicating that someone will suffer for their wrongs; in a way, Cal's intersex condition symbolizes this Greek hubris. In another incestuous relationship, Milton makes love to Tessie using a clarinet which he lovingly rubs against her; their incestuous relationship enables them to contribute mutated genes to their child Cal. Cal's mother interferes with fate by attempting to make her second child a daughter. Cal believes this interference was a <b>factor</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> being a hermaphrodite. Conversely, Cal's relationship with his brother, ChapterEleven, {{is indicative of the}} possible dissimilarities that are products of the biosocial.|$|E
50|$|In an {{interview}} following his release, Lerach offered {{his thoughts and}} opinions that possible political motivation and the timing of his indictment could have been likely <b>factors</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> prosecution.
