5|$|Virgin America {{announced}} in January 2011 a firm order for sixty new Airbus A320 aircraft, including thirty new Airbus A320neos, {{that would be}} delivered starting in 2016, as a formal expansion of an initial commitment made by Richard Branson at the Farnborough Airshow in July 2010. In April 2011, Virgin America's hub at San Francisco International Airport relocated to the newly remodeled Terminal 2, sharing the gates with American Airlines. In late October 2011, the airline migrated to Sabre's <b>global</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> (GDS) that handles reservations, frequent-flier accounts, flight operations data and crew scheduling. Difficulties with the changeover sparked widespread customer complaints, due to early technical malfunctions surrounding the program. On December 12, 2012, Virgin America opened their first airport lounge, the Virgin America Loft, at Los Angeles International Airport. Virgin America had its first public offering at the NASDAQ stock exchange on November 14, 2014, selling 13.3M shares to raise $307 million for the company.|$|E

2500|$|On September 1, 2015, Lufthansa {{implemented}} its controversial 16 euro surcharge on <b>Global</b> <b>Distribution</b> <b>System</b> bookings. The surcharge is payable unless {{tickets are}} purchased {{directly from the}} airline's website, or at its service centers and ticket counters at the airport. In a statement responding to Lufthansa’s strategy, Amadeus said the new model would make “comparison and transparency more difficult because travelers will now be forced to go to multiple channels {{to search for the}} best fares. For the period between September 1–14, the airline experienced a 16.1% drop in revenue, indicating to some that the new fee backfired, although the airline maintains the statement that the decrease was due to the pilot strike, and [...] "other seasonal effects".|$|E
