30|$|The {{stress levels}} {{resulting}} due to mismatch in CTE {{can also lead}} to <b>hillock</b> <b>formation,</b> a stress-induced diffusional relaxation process, during the IC fabrication process (Timma et al. 2010; Lin et al. 2001). After depositing capping nitride material at above 380  °C two <b>hillock</b> <b>formation</b> modes were observed: (i) grain boundary sliding mode leading to single grain extrusion hillock and (ii) diffusion dominated <b>hillock</b> <b>formation</b> mode leading to smaller hillocks (Timma et al. 2010). Post nitride hillocks preferentially nucleate at the triple junction of the grain boundary. It is believed that interface Cu/TaN diffusion dominates diffusion mechanism at smaller line dimensions compared to grain boundary diffusion (Timma et al. 2010). The hillocks can be potential area for localized peaks in electric field which can result in early failure by dielectric breakdown. Even though copper has same CTE in all the directions, the anisotropy in elastic moduli of copper leads to development of different stress levels in adjacent grains in turn promoting grain boundary sliding potentially leading to <b>hillock</b> <b>formation.</b>|$|E

At the same normal load, the silicon crystal plane with low elastic modulus or high density of dangling bonds can facilitate the formation of friction-induced hillock. Because of the configuration of Si-Si bonds, crystal silicon reveals different mechanical properties on various crystal planes, which eventually result in the variation of <b>hillock</b> <b>formation</b> in the present study.

40|$|Thin {{films are}} {{fabricated}} in conditions {{far from the}} equilibrium, and they bear a high surface to volume ratio. Therefore, when thermally activated, they gain the required atomic mobility to reduce their free energy associated with surfaces, by transforming to a stable morphology of isolated islands. This phenomenon is called “solid-state dewetting”. Solid-state dewetting of thin films {{is a source of}} failure in microelectronic applications. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, we present an in-situ investigation on the integrity of a polycrystalline Pt thin film which was enhanced by applying ZnO as an adhesion layer between the film and the Si substrate. Besides the typical morphological evolution during dewetting of a continuous thin film e. g. <b>hillocking,</b> hole <b>formation,</b> hole growth and formation of isolated islands, we report on two distinct events that were captured in real-time. Sublimation of ZnO and secondary hole formation via break up of blisters of Pt thin film, in this case at ~ 1053 K, and formation of an amorphous platinum silicide phase and Pt 3 Si intermetallic phase in later stages of dewetting. We do however highlight that these observations are for films exposed to high temperatures under high vacuum conditions and caution must be exercised when applying these observations to other systems. Moreover, solid-state dewetting can lead to the formation of complex submicron or nanostructures, depending on the original geometry of the film. In single crystal thin films, due to the structural symmetry and anisotropic surface properties, the ordered assembly of the islands occurs spontaneously during dewetting. There is an increasing interest in controlling the morphology of dewetting structures due to higher demand for the scaled-down devices. The morphological characteristics of these structures are manifested by instabilities that happen simultaneously during dewetting. Precise identification of these instabilities leads to an enhanced inference of the underpinning kinetic mechanisms that govern the formation of complex dewetting morphologies. In the second part of the thesis, we use pre-patterned single crystal Ni film on single crystal MgO substrate as a model system to study the effect of various parameters on final morphology of dewetted structures. More specifically, we investigate the effect of film's edge roughness, the in-plane crystallographic orientation of film patches, annealing temperature and annealing ambient on fingering instability. We also demonstrate that solid-state dewetting can be exploited as a self-assembly method to achieve the desired morphology via introducing a template to the edges of patches of single crystal Ni film. The template is systematically designed to facilitate the fingering instability and control the spacing of void fingers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Annealing {{behavior}} of dilute Cu-X alloys (adding element X = transition metal and rare-earth metal {{with less than}} 3 at %) was investigated in terms of resistivity, internal stress, grain growth and <b>hillock</b> <b>formation.</b> The resistivity increases with addition of impurities regardless of kinds of adding elements. Generally, resistivity starts to decrease on annealing above 200 ºC. Among present Cu dilute alloys, Sn addition shows the lowest resistivity 2. 5 μΩcm on annealing at 400 ºC. However, compared with a pure Cu film, salient grain growth of present dilute alloys does not takes place even at temperatures above 300 ºC, where the grain size is nearly {{the same as that}} of as-deposited films. In-situ surface observation using an atomic force microscope (AFM) revealed that hillocks did not grow on cooling stage (under tension), but started to form on heating stage (under compression). The scanning electron microscopy (SEM) observation of hillocks thus formed in present dilute alloy films shows that the external appearance of these defects was quite different from those observed in Al and Al alloy films. They most likely grow with a preferential crystal plane, not irregular growth like Al and Al alloy films. The internal stresses in most of the present as-deposited dilute Cu alloy films were nearly zero or compression of – 25 to – 100 MPa, and upon annealing, they started to increase in tensile manner due to thermal stresses induced by the mismatch of the thermal expansion between substrates and deposited films.

Although the silicon wafers with various crystal planes present different elastic modulus, all these wafers consist of Si-I phase (diamond-like structure) regardless of crystallographic orientations. During the sliding process, the transformation of Si-I to amorphous structure may occur on three silicon crystal planes, which will further induce the formation of hillock on these silicon surfaces. However, under the same loading conditions, the height of hillock on various silicon crystal planes was different as shown in Figures  2, 3 and 4.
