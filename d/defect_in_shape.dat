This approach {{is based on a}} reverse method which imply to first perform a set of numerical indentations. Contrary to inverse methods, the generated analytical reduced model can then be used to instantaneously evaluate the desired local properties from experimental instrumented indentation curves. In order to improve the estimation accuracy, it is able {{to take into account the}} elastic deformations of the indenter occurring during the test. It is also able to take into account the <b>defect</b> <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> of the actual indenter. This proposed general approach has been applied in the particular case of linear hardening behaviour. This approach were then successfully validated by comparison with experimental tensile test results. Finally it has been used to estimate the local tensile curves in various projects, such as the local characterisation of welded joints to be treated by high frequency hammer peening...|$|E

Skeleton castings are low weight cellular material mainly used for energy absorption in for example automotive industry.

40|$|Raf kinases relay signals {{inducing}} proliferation, differentiation, and survival. The Raf- 1 isoform {{has been}} extensively studied as the upstream kinase linking Ras activation to the MEK/ERK module. Recently, however, genetic experiments have shown that Raf- 1 plays {{an essential role in}} counteracting apoptosis, and that it does so independently of its ability to activate MEK. By conditional gene ablation, we now show that Raf- 1 is required for normal wound healing in vivo and for the migration of keratinocytes and fibroblasts in vitro. Raf- 1 –deficient cells show a symmetric, contracted appearance, characterized by cortical actin bundles and by a disordered vimentin cytoskeleton. These defects are due to the hyperactivity and incorrect localization of the Rho-effector Rok-α to the plasma membrane. Raf- 1 physically associates with Rok-α in wild-type (WT) cells, and reintroduction of either WT or kinase-dead Raf- 1 in knockout fibroblasts rescues their <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> <b>shape</b> and migration. Thus, Raf- 1 plays an essential, kinase-independent function as a spatial regulator of Rho downstream signaling during migration...|$|R

Inactivation of the ylm genes resulted in some morphological and/or division abnormalities, depending on the inactivated gene. Transcriptional analysis revealed a relationship between these genes and the ftsA and ftsZ cell division genes, also indicating that {{the connection between the}} dcw cluster and the divIVA region is more extensive than just chromosomal position and gene organization...|$|R

40|$|NPM (nucleophosmin; {{also known}} as B 23) is an abundantly and ubiquitously {{expressed}} multifunctional nucleolar phosphoprotein, which is involved in numerous cellular processes, including ribosome biogenesis, protein chaperoning and centrosome duplication; however, the role of NPM in the cell cycle still remains unknown. In the present study, we show dynamic localization of NPM throughout the cell cycle of HeLa cells. Using a combination of RNAi (RNA interference) and three-dimensional microscopy we show that NPM is localized at the chromosome periphery during mitosis. We also demonstrate that depletion of NPM causes distortion of nucleolar structure as expected and leads to unexpected dramatic changes in nuclear morphology with multiple micronuclei formation. The <b>defect</b> <b>in</b> nuclear <b>shape</b> of NPM-depleted cells, which is clearly observed by live-cell imaging, {{is due to the}} distortion of cytoskeletal (α-tubulin and β-actin) structure, resulting from the <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> centrosomal microtubule nucleation. These results indicate that NPM is an essential protein not only for the formation of normal nucleolar structure, but also for the maintenance of regular nuclear <b>shape</b> <b>in</b> HeLa cells...|$|R
40|$|BnAP 2, an APETALA 2 (AP 2) -like gene, {{has been}} {{isolated}} from Brassica napus cultivar Zhongshuang 9. The cDNA of BnAP 2, with 1, 299 bp in length, encoded a transcription factor comprising of 432 amino acid residues. Results from complementary experiment indicated that BnAP 2 was completely capable of restoring the phenotype of Arabidopsis ap 2 - 11 mutant. Together with the sequence and expression data, the complementation data suggested that BnAP 2 encodes the ortholog of AtAP 2. To address the transcriptional activation of BnAP 2, we performed transactivation assays in yeast. Fusion protein of BnAP 2 with GAL 4 DNA binding domain strongly activated transcription in yeast, and the transactivating activity of BnAP 2 was localized to the N-terminal 100 amino acids. To further study {{the function of}} BnAP 2 involved in the phenotype of B. napus, we used a transgenic approach that involved targeted RNA interference (RNAi) repression induced by ihp-RNA. Floral various phenotype defectives and reduced female fertility were observed in B. napus BnAP 2 -RNAi lines. Loss of the function of BnAP 2 gene also resulted in delayed sepal abscission and senescence with the ethylene-independent pathway. In the strong BnAP 2 -RNAi lines, seeds showed <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> <b>shape,</b> structure and development and larger size. Strong BnAP 2 -RNAi and wild-type seeds initially did not display {{a significant difference in}} morphology at 10 DAF, but the development of BnAP 2 -RNAi seeds was slower than that of wild type at 20 DAF, and further at 30 DAF, wild-type seeds were essentially a...|$|R
40|$|The pharynx of Caenorhabditis elegans is {{a nearly}} {{self-contained}} neuromuscular organ responsible for feeding. To identify genes {{involved in the}} development or function of the excitable cells of the pharynx, I screened for worms with visible <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> pharyngeal feeding behavior. Fifty-two mutations identified 35 genes, at least 22 previously unknown. The genes broke down into three broad classes: 2 pha genes, mutations <b>in</b> which caused <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> the <b>shape</b> of the pharynx, 7 phm genes, mutations <b>in</b> which caused <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> the contractile structures of the pharyngeal muscle, and 26 eat genes, mutants in which had abnormal pharyngeal muscle motions, but had normally shaped and normally birefringent pharynxes capable of vigorous contraction. Although the Eat phenotypes were diverse, most resembled those caused by <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> the pharyngeal nervous system. For some of the eat genes there is direct evidence from previous genetic mosaic and pharmacological studies that they do in fact affect nervous system. In eat- 5 mutants the motions of the {{different parts of the}} pharynx were poorly synchronized. eat- 6 and eat- 12 mutants failed to relax their pharyngeal muscles properly. These pharyngeal motion defects are most easily explained as resulting from abnormal electrical excitability of the pharyngeal muscle membrane...|$|R
40|$|AbstractActin-like {{proteins}} MreB and Mbl {{are required}} for proper cell shape and for viability in B. subtilis[1, 2] and form dynamic helical filaments underneath the cell membrane [1, 3]. We have found that depletion of MreB and Mbl proteins leads to a rapid <b>defect</b> <b>in</b> chromosome segregation before a <b>defect</b> <b>in</b> cell <b>shape</b> becomes detectable. Under these conditions, the SMC chromosome segregation complex that is essential for proper chromosome arrangement and segregation [4 – 6] loses its specific subcellular localization, and replication origins fail to localize in a regular bipolar manner as in wild type cells [7 – 10]. Time-lapse microscopy showed that during depletion of MreB, origin regions can move towards the same cell pole, showing that bipolar orientation of origin separation is lost. Contrarily, depletion of three other cell shape determinants, MreC, MreD, or MreBH (the third B. subtilis actin homolog) {{had no effect on}} chromosome segregation but varying effects on cell morphology. Depletion of MreC and MreD resulted in formation of round cells, while depletion of MreBH led to formation of vibrio-shaped cells. The data show that actin proteins Mbl and MreB {{are required for}} proper chromosome segregation and that Mre proteins affect different aspects <b>in</b> cell <b>shape...</b>|$|R

Here {{we examined}} the effects of two lethal α spectrin alleles (α-specrg 41 and α-specrg 35) on development and function of the larval midgut. Homozygous null α-specrg 41 -mutant larvae exhibited a striking <b>defect</b> <b>in</b> middle midgut acidification. In contrast, many homozygous α-specrg 35 mutants were capable of acidification, indicating partial function of the truncated α-specrg 35 product. Acidification was also blocked by a mutation in thelabialgene, which is required for differentiation of cuprophilic cells in the midgut, suggesting that these cells secrete acid. We found that two isoforms of spectrin (αβ and αβH) are segregated within the basolateral and apical domains of cuprophilic cells, respectively. The most conspicuous <b>defect</b> <b>in</b> cuprophilic cells fromlabialand α spectrin mutants was in morphogenesis of the invaginated apical domain, although basolateral defects may also contribute to the acidification phenotype. Acid secretion in vertebrate systems is thought to involve the polarized activities of apical proton pumps and basolateral anion exchangers, both of which interact with spectrin. We propose that the α-specrg 41 mutation inDrosophilainterferes with the polarized activities of homologous molecules that drive acid secretion in cuprophilic cells...|$|R

Furthermore, de-regulation of their functions is deleterious to tissue architecture and {{can result in}} the sorting of somatic rounded clones minimizing their contact with surrounding wild-type (wt) cells. <b>Defects</b> <b>in</b> the <b>shape</b> of somatic clones correlate with <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> proliferation, cell affinity, cell-cell adhesion, oriented cell division and cortical contractility. Combining genetics, live-imaging, laser ablation and computer simulations, we aim to analyze whether distinct or similar mechanisms can account for the common role of tumor suppressors and proto-oncogenes in cell-cell contact regulation. In Drosophila epithelia, the tumor suppressors Fat (Ft) and Dachsous (Ds) regulate cell proliferation, tissue morphogenesis, planar cell polarity and junction tension. By analyzing the evolution over time of ft mutant cells and clones, we show that ft clones reduce their cell-cell contacts with the surrounding wt tissue {{in the absence of}} concomitant cell divisions and over-proliferation. This contact reduction depends on opposed changes of junction tensions in the clone bulk and its boundary with neighboring wt tissue. More generally, either clone bulk or boundary junction tension is modulated by the activation of Yorkie, Myc and Ras, yielding similar contact reductions with wt cells. Together, our data highlight mechanical roles for proto-oncogene and tumor suppressor pathways in cell-cell interactions...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe proper {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} coordination of mitosis and cytokinesis is essential for maintaining genomic integrity. We describe the identification and characterization of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae IBD 1 gene, which encodes a novel protein that regulates the proper nuclear division and bud separation. IBD 1 was identified by the limited homology to byr 4, a dosage-dependent regulator of cytokinesis in Schizosaccharomyces pombe. IBD 1 is not an essential gene, and the knock-out cells show no growth defects except for the reduced mating efficiency [1]. However, upon ectopic expression from an inducible promoter, IBD 1 is lethal to the cell and leads to abnormal nuclear division and bud separation. In detail, approximately 90 % of the IBD 1 overexpressing cells arrest at large bud stages with dividing or divided nuclei. In some IBD 1 overexpressing cells, spindle elongation and chromosome separation occur within the mother cell, leading to anucleated and binucleate daughter cells. The anucleated cell can not bud, but the binucleate cell proceeds through another cell cycle(s) to produce a cell with multiple nuclei and multiple buds. Observations of the F-actin and chitin rings in the IBD 1 overexpressing cells reveal that these cells lose the polarity for bud site selection and growth or attain the hyper-polarity for growth. Consistent with the phenotypes, the IBD 1 overexpressing cells contain {{a broad range of}} DNA content, from 2 to 4 N or more. A functional Ibd 1 p-GFP fusion protein localizes to a single dot at the nuclear DNA boundary in the divided nuclei or to double dots in dividing nuclei, suggesting its localization on the spindle pole body (SPB). The cross-species expressions of IBD 1 in S. pombe and byr 4 in S. cerevisiae cause <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> <b>shape,</b> implicating the presence of a conserved mechanism for the control of cytokinesis in eukaryotes. We propose that Ibd 1 p is an SPB associated protein that links proper nuclear division to cytokinesis and bud separation...|$|R

The occluder is a simple way to focus light, as in a pinhole camera, temporarily removing the effects of refractive errors such as myopia. Because light passes only {{through the center of the}} eye's lens, <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> the <b>shape</b> of the lens (errors of refraction) have no effect while the occluder is used. In this way the ophthalmologist, orthoptist or optometrist can estimate the maximum improvement in a patient's vision that can be attained by lenses to correct errors of refraction. [...] This can be used to distinguish visual defects caused by refractive error, which improve when the occluder is used, from other problems, which do not. The pinhole occluder can also be used in testing visual acuity in mydriatic patients. In this case the pinhole occluder compensates for the inability to contract the iris assisting the eye in obtaining a retinal projection similar to that of a non-cycloplegic eye.|$|R

40|$|Hedgehog {{signaling}} {{is required}} for many aspects of development in vertebrates and invertebrates. Misregulation of the Hedgehog pathway causes developmental abnormalities and has been implicated in certain types of cancer. Large-scale genetic screens in zebrafish have identified a group of mutations, termed you- class mutations, that share common <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> somite <b>shape</b> and <b>in</b> most cases disrupt Hedgehog signaling. These mutant embryos exhibit U-shaped somites characteristic of <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> slow muscle development. In addition, Hedgehog pathway mutations disrupt spinal cord patterning. We report the positional cloning of you, {{one of the original}} you -class mutations, and show that it {{is required for}} Hedgehog signaling in the development of slow muscle and in the specification of ventral fates in the spinal cord. The you gene encodes a novel protein with conserved EGF and CUB domains and a secretory pathway signal sequence. Epistasis experiments support an extracellular role for You upstream of the Hedgehog response mechanism. Analysis of chimeras indicates that you mutant cells can appropriately respond to Hedgehog signaling in a wild-type environment. Additional chimera analysis indicates that wild-type you gene function is not required in axial Hedgehog-producing cells, suggesting that You is essential for transport or stability of Hedgehog signals in the extracellular environment. Our positional cloning and functional studies demonstrate that You is a novel extracellular component of the Hedgehog pathway in vertebrates. </p...|$|R

The Sb-sbd gene encodes a type II transmembrane serine protease (TTSP).

Molecular characterization of Sb-sbd mutations and rescue experiments with wild-type and modified Sb-sbd transgenic constructs show that the protease domain {{is required}} for both leg and bristle functions. Truncated proteins that express the noncatalytic domains without the protease have dominant effects in bristles but not in legs. Leg morphogenesis, but not bristle growth, is sensitive to Sb-sbd overexpression. Antibody localization of the Sb-sbd protein shows apical expression in elongating legs.

To identify new morphology proteins, we isolated mutations incompatible with the mmm 1 - 1 mutant. One of these mutants, mmm 2 - 1, is defective in a novel outer membrane protein. Lack of Mmm 2 p causes a <b>defect</b> <b>in</b> mitochondrial <b>shape</b> and loss of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) nucleoids. Like the Mmm 1 protein (Aiken Hobbs, A. E., M. Srinivasan, J. M.

While some of the Mmm 2 p-containing spots colocalize with those containing Mmm 1 p, at least some of Mmm 2 p is separate from Mmm 1 p. Moreover, while Mmm 2 p and Mmm 1 p both appear to be part of large complexes, we find that Mmm 2 p and Mmm 1 p do not stably interact and appear to be members of two different structures.

Currently, we have a limited understanding of the regulatory mechanisms that have evolved to specify the gametophytic developmental programs. To unravel such mechanisms, {{it is necessary to}} identify transcription factors (TF) that are part of such haploid regulatory networks. Here we focus on bZIP TFs that have critical roles in plants, animals and other kingdoms. We report the functional characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana AtbZIP 34 that is expressed in both gametophytic and surrounding sporophytic tissues during flower development. T-DNA insertion mutants in AtbZIP 34 show pollen morphological <b>defects</b> that result <b>in</b> reduced pollen germination efficiency and slower pollen tube growth both in vitro and in vivo.

The Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y- 27632 inhibits senescence induced but not activation induced phosphatidylserine exposure. To investigate further the specific mechanisms, we now utilized mice with genetic deletion of the ROCK 1 isoform. Methods and Results: ROCK 1 -deficient mouse platelets expose significantly more phosphatidylserine and generate more thrombin upon activation with collagen compared to wild-type platelets. There {{were no significant}} <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> platelet <b>shape</b> change, aggregation, or calcium response compared to wild-type platelets. Collagen-stimulated ROCK 1 -deficient platelets also displayed decreased phosphorylation levels of Lim Kinase- 1 and cofilin- 1.

Precisely regulated signaling molecules such as vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) direct some of these endothelial behaviors. Newly forming blood vessels also become subjected to novel biomechanical forces upon initiation of cardiac contractions.

Titin {{was found to be}} required for the initiation of proper heart contractions as well as for maintaining the correct overall shape and orientation of individual cardiomyocytes. Cardiac dysfunction in shrunken-head mutant embryos provided an opportunity to study the effects of lack of blood circulation on the morphogenesis of endothelial cells. Without blood flow, differentiating endothelial cells display <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> their <b>shapes</b> and patterns of cell–cell contact. These endothelial cells, without exposure to blood circulation, have an abnormal distribution within vasculogenic vessels.

Here we report that mice lacking the Na+/H+ Exchanger Regulatory Factor 1 (NHERF 1 /Slc 9 a 3 r 1, also known as EBP 50) develop profound communicating hydrocephalus associated with fewer and disorganized ependymal cilia. Knockdown of NHERF 1 /slc 9 a 3 r 1 in zebrafish embryos also causes severe hydrocephalus of the hindbrain and impaired ciliogenesis in the otic vesicle. Ultrastructural analysis did not reveal <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> the <b>shape</b> or organization of individual cilia. Similar phenotypes have been described in animals with deficiencies in Wnt signaling and the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) pathway. We show that NHERF 1 binds the PCP core genes Frizzled (Fzd) and Vangl. We further show that NHERF 1 assembles a ternary complex with Fzd 4 and Vangl 2 and promotes translocation of Vangl 2 to the plasma membrane, in particular to the apical surface of ependymal cells.

In addition, we characterized deletion mutations in nonessential genes of unknown function in the WalRKSpn two-component system regulon, which also contains the essential pcsB cell division gene. Several mutants did not show overt phenotypes, which is perhaps indicative of redundancy. In contrast, two new mutants showed distinct <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> PG biosynthesis.

Epistasis analysis indicated that DacA functions before DacB in d-Ala removal, and immunofluorescence microscopy showed that DacA and DacB are located over the entire surface of pneumococcal cells.

Corneal ectasia {{is a case of}} severe deformation, which is characterized by a progressive bulging. It can occur naturally or after LASIK surgery, leading to damaged vision and ultimately blindness. Corneal cross-linking (CXL) has recently been proposed as a minimally invasive treatment to stop the disease progression. It consists in photo-reticulating the collagen fibrils to stiffen the cornea. However, this treatment is currently not monitored in real-time. Here, we propose Supersonic Shear Wave Imaging (SSI) to measure the stiffening effect of CXL. SSI elastography consists in generating and tracking a shear wave in tissues using ultrafast (30000 frames/sec) ultrasonic scanners (Aixplorer, SuperSonic Imagine). The tissue elasticity is deduced from the shear wave speed. For corneal applications, we implemented SSI on high-frequency ultrasonic arrays (15 MHz). We performed in vivo CXL on anesthetized pigs combined with SSI monitoring. We obtained elastic maps after CXL that exhibited significant stiffening in the treated area (56 ± 15 % of the shear wave speed) compared to the untreated area. These results demonstrated the feasibility of SSI for the in vivo and real-time monitoring of CXL...|$|R
40|$|International audienceDuring {{its life}} cycle, the {{protozoan}} pathogen Leishmania donovani {{is exposed to}} contrasting environments inside insect vector and vertebrate host, to which the parasite must adapt for extra- and intracellular survival. Combining null mutant analysis with phosphorylation site-specific mutagenesis and functional complementation we genetically tested the requirement of the L. donovani chaperone cyclophilin 40 (LdCyP 40) for infection. Targeted replacement of LdCyP 40 {{had no effect on}} parasite viability, axenic amastigote differentiation, and resistance to various forms of environmental stress in culture, suggesting important functional redundancy to other parasite chaperones. However, ultrastructural analyses and video microscopy of cyp 40 -/- promastigotes uncovered important <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> cell <b>shape,</b> organization of the subpellicular tubulin network and motility at stationary growth phase. More importantly, cyp 40 -/- parasites were unable to establish intracellular infection in murine macrophages and were eliminated during the first 24 h post infection. Surprisingly, cyp 40 -/- infectivity was restored in complemented parasites expressing a CyP 40 mutant of the unique S 274 phosphorylation site. Together our data reveal non-redundant CyP 40 functions in parasite cytoskeletal remodelling relevant for the development of infectious parasites in vitro independent of its phosphorylation status, and provide a framework for the genetic analysis of Leishmania-specific phosphorylation sites and their role in regulating parasite protein function...|$|R
40|$|The transbilayer {{movement}} of phosphatidylserine mediates the platelet procoagulant activity during collagen stimulation. The Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) inhibitor Y- 27632 inhibits senescence induced but not activation induced phosphatidylserine exposure. To investigate further the specific mechanisms, we now utilized mice with genetic deletion of the ROCK 1 isoform. ROCK 1 -deficient mouse platelets expose significantly more phosphatidylserine and generate more thrombin upon activation with collagen compared to wild-type platelets. There {{were no significant}} <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> platelet <b>shape</b> change, aggregation, or calcium response compared to wild-type platelets. Collagen-stimulated ROCK 1 -deficient platelets also displayed decreased phosphorylation levels of Lim Kinase- 1 and cofilin- 1. However, there was no reduction in phosphorylation levels of myosin phosphatase subunit- 1 (MYPT 1) or myosin light chain (MLC). In an in vivo light/dye-induced endothelial injury/thrombosis model, ROCK 1 -deficient mice presented a shorter occlusion time in cremasteric venules when compared to wild-type littermates (3. 16 ± 1. 33 min versus 6. 6 ± 2. 6 min; p = 0. 01). These studies define ROCK 1 as a new regulator for collagen-induced phosphatidylserine exposure in platelets with functional consequences on thrombosis. This effect was downstream of calcium signaling and was mediated by Lim Kinase- 1 / cofilin- 1 -induced cytoskeletal changes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In {{eukaryotic}} cells, dynamin and flotillin {{are involved}} in processes such as endocytosis and lipid raft formation, respectively. Dynamin is a GTPase that exerts motor-like activity during the pinching off of vesicles, while flotillins are coiled coil rich membrane proteins with no known enzymatic activity. Bacteria also possess orthologs of both classes of proteins, but their function has been unclear. Results We show that deletion of the single dynA or floT genes lead to no phenotype or a mild <b>defect</b> <b>in</b> septum formation {{in the case of}} the dynA gene, while dynA floT double mutant cells were highly elongated and irregularly shaped, although the MreB cytoskeleton appeared to be normal. DynA colocalizes with FtsZ, and the dynA deletion strain shows aberrant FtsZ rings in a subpopulation of cells. The mild division defect of the dynA deletion is exacerbated by an additional deletion in ezrA, which affects FtsZ ring formation, and also by the deletion of a late division gene (divIB), indicating that DynA affects several steps in cell division. DynA and mreB deletions generated a synthetic <b>defect</b> <b>in</b> cell <b>shape</b> maintenance, showing that MreB and DynA play non-epistatic functions <b>in</b> cell <b>shape</b> maintenance. TIRF microscopy revealed that FloT forms many dynamic membrane assemblies that frequently colocalize with the division septum. The deletion of dynA did not change the pattern of localization of FloT, and vice versa, showing that the two proteins play non redundant roles in a variety of cellular processes. Expression of dynamin or flotillin T in eukaryotic S 2 cells revealed that both proteins assemble at the cell membrane. While FloT formed patch structures, DynA built up tubulated structures extending away from the cells. Conclusions Bacillus subtilis dynamin ortholog DynA plays a role during cell division and <b>in</b> cell <b>shape</b> maintenance. It shows a genetic link with flotillin T, with both proteins playing non-redundant functions at the cell membrane, where they assemble even in the absence of any bacterial cofactor. </p...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method to {{calculate}} the splitting of natural frequency of the shell of hemispherical resonator gyro. (HRG). The paper considers splitting that arises from the small defect of the middle surface, which makes the resonator different from the rotary shell. The presented method {{is a combination of}} the perturbation method and the finite element method. The method allows us to find the frequency splitting caused by <b>defects</b> <b>in</b> <b>shape,</b> arbitrary distributed <b>in</b> the circumferential direction. This is achieved by calculating the perturbations of multiple natural frequencies of the second and higher orders. The proposed method allows us to calculate the splitting of multiple frequencies for the shell with the meridian of arbitrary shape. A developed finite element is an annular element of the shell and has two nodes. Projections of movements are used on the axis of the global cylindrical system of coordinates, as the unknown. To approximate the movements are used polynomials of the second degree. Within the finite element the geometric characteristics are arranged in a series according to the small parameter of perturbations of the middle surface geometry. Movements on the final element are arranged in series according to the small parameter, and in a series according to circumferential angle. With computer used to implement the method, three-dimensional arrays are used to store the perturbed quantities. This allows the use of regular expressions for the mass and stiffness matrices, when building the finite element, instead of analytic dependencies for each perturbation of these matrices of the required order with desirable mathematical operations redefined in accordance with the perturbation method. As a test task, is calculated frequency splitting of non-circular cylindrical resonator with Navier boundary conditions. The discrepancy between the results and semi-analytic solution to this problem is less than 1 %. For a cylindrical shell is made a comparison of results with solution in ANSYS commercial complex - a difference is less than 1 %. For a hemispherical shell was found the frequency splitting. The comparison has shown that a discrepancy between the results and ANSYS solution is less than 1 %. The solution of this problem allows us to estimate further a mutual influence of defects of different nature (shape, thickness, density, modulus of elasticity, etc.) on splitting the frequency of the HRG. This is an urgent problem in terms of balancing the HRG resonators. </p...|$|R
