5|$|At this point, {{still early}} in his {{surgical}} career, Negus took {{a different approach to}} that which was common at the time. Rather than be apprenticed to a leading surgeon in his ENT (ear, nose and throat) speciality, he undertook basic research on the structure of the larynx that would lead to a higher degree in 1924 and the publication of books and papers on the topic in later years. While engaged in this research, Negus continued his work at King's College Hospital, being appointed junior surgeon in 1924. It was during this period, following his return from the USA, that Negus both promoted the methods and tools he had seen used in Philadelphia by Jackson, and worked to improve the designs of the endoscopes and other equipment used in <b>ENT</b> <b>surgery.</b> These instruments, developed in collaboration with the Genito-Urinary Company of London, included laryngoscopes, bronchoscopes (such as the Negus bronchoscope) and oesophagoscopes. Other surgical innovations developed by Negus included an operating table (known as the King's College table), and a speaking valve for use in tracheotomy tubes. He also helped develop strategies for treatments of throat cancer to aid the choice between surgery and radiotherapy.|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: In recent years, {{attention}} {{of the health care}} managers is attracted to three factors including promotion of services quality, accessibility and procurement of financial resources of relevant organizations. The aim {{of this study is to}} consider the executive status of guideline of managed health care for preoperative assessments of ENT patients at Bazarganan Hospital in 2005. Materials and Methods: The present research is conducted on 140 cases in descriptive form. The research information is collected by using a check list. Indexes and method of descriptive statistics are used for the data analysis and statistical study. Results: Of one hundred and forty ENT patient records, in 136 (97 %) of the cases American Society of Anesthesia criteria had been registered. Vital signs, patient histories and CBC were recorded in 137 (98 %), 138 (99. 5 %) and 139 (98. 3 %) patients recordes, respectively. Eight (69. 7 %) over 60 years old cases had been X-rayed. EKG has been performed on all fifteen cases over 40 years old. Thirty nine (28 %) recordes contained internist and cardiologist counselling. Conclusions: Assessment of guidline indicates very good status. Application of managed care guidelines of preoperative assessment in <b>ENT</b> <b>surgeries</b> could play a crucial role in reducing complication of <b>ENT</b> <b>surgeries</b> and the improvement of the implication of the guidelines...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Monitored {{anaesthesia}} care involves administering {{a combination}} of drugs for anxiolytic, hypnotic, amnestic and analgesic effect. Ideally it should result in less physiological disturbance and allow for more rapid recovery than general anaesthesia. It typically involves administration of local anaesthesia in combination with IV sedatives, anxiolytic and analgesic drugs which is a common practice during various ENT surgical procedures. AIM OF STUDY Is to “Compare Dexmedetomidine with Fentanyl for sedation in tympanoplasty (<b>ENT</b> <b>Surgeries)</b> ”. The objective {{of the study is}} to evaluate the efficacy of dexmedetomidine and fentanyl as an appropriate sedative drug for Monitored Anaesthesia Care in Tympanoplasty (<b>ENT</b> <b>surgeries)</b> METHODS & MATERIALS A total of 60 patients are being recruited into this study with regards to assess, Pain, Discomfort, Sedation, Peripheral Oxygen Saturation (SPO 2) & Systolic Blood Pressure (SBP), Diastolic blood pressure (DBP), Mean arterial blood pressure(MAP) & Heart rate This study was undertaken at Govt. ENT Hospital Hyderabad. Sixty (60) patients undergoing Tympanoplasty surgery were taken for study. Thus the study contains 30 patients in Dexmedetomidine group-(Group D) and 30 patients in Fentanyl group (Group F) RESULT Dexmedetomidine provides less discomfort, better sedation, and analgesia when compared with fentanyl under monitored anaesthesia care (Conscious sedation). However, the risk of adverse effects requires monitoring for ready intervention. It provides a unique type of sedation, “conscious sedation” in which patients appear to be sleepy but are easily arousable, cooperative and communicative when stimulated. It is sedative and analgesic agent, with opioid-sparing properties and minimal respiratory depression. ...|$|R
