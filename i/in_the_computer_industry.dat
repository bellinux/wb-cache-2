Originally handled by Federated Media Publishing, selling advertising space on the website is now managed by Condé Nast. In addition to online advertising, Ars Technica has sold subscriptions to the website since 2001, now named Ars Premier subscriptions. Subscribers are not shown advertisements, and receive benefits including {{the ability to see}} exclusive articles, post in certain areas of the Ars Technica forum, and participate in live chat rooms with notable people <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>industry.</b> To a lesser extent, revenue is also collected from content sponsorship. A series of articles about the future of collaboration was sponsored by IBM, and the site's Exploring Datacenters section is sponsored by data-management company NetApp. In the past, Ars Technica collected shared revenue from affiliate marketing by advertising deals and discounts from online retailers, and from the sale of Ars Technica-branded merchandise.|$|E

25|$|Many early computers, {{including}} the CDC 6600, the LINC, the PDP-1, and the UNIVAC 1107, use ones' complement notation; {{the descendants of}} the UNIVAC 1107, the UNIVAC 1100/2200 series, continue to do so. The IBM 700/7000 series scientific machines use sign/magnitude notation, except for the index registers which are two's complement. Early commercial two's complement computers include the Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-5 and the 1963 PDP-6.

25|$|Pure monocrystalline silicon is used {{to produce}} silicon wafers used in the {{semiconductor}} industry, in electronics, and in some high-cost and high-efficiency photovoltaic applications. Pure silicon is an intrinsic semiconductor, which means that unlike metals, it conducts electron holes and electrons released from atoms by heat; silicon's electrical conductivity increases with higher temperatures. Pure silicon has too low a conductivity (i.e., too high a resistivity) {{to be used as}} a circuit element in electronics. In practice, pure silicon is doped with small concentrations of certain other elements, which greatly increase its conductivity and adjust its electrical response by controlling the number and charge (positive or negative) of activated carriers. Such control is necessary for transistors, solar cells, semiconductor detectors, and other semiconductor devices used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>industry</b> and other technical applications. In silicon photonics, silicon can be used as a continuous wave Raman laser medium to produce coherent light, though it is ineffective as an everyday light source.|$|E
25|$|The Computer Science Masters program offers {{instruction}} in the fundamental principles, design and applications of computer systems and computer technologies. Students who obtain an MS degree in computer science are qualified to do significant development work <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>industry</b> or important application areas. Those who receive a doctoral degree {{are in a position}} to hold faculty appointments and do research and development work at the forefront of this rapidly changing and expanding field. The emphasis for the MS in Information Systems program is on the use of computer systems in business. For the Master of Science in Scientific Computing, it is designed to provide broad training in areas related to scientific computing using modern computing technology and mathematical modeling arising in various applications. The core of the curriculum for all computer science graduate students consists of courses in algorithms, programming languages, compilers, artificial intelligence, database systems, and operating systems. Advanced courses are offered in many areas such as natural language processing, the theory of computation, computer vision, software engineering, compiler optimization techniques, computer graphics, distributed computing, multimedia, networks, cryptography and security, groupware and computational finance. Adjunct faculty, drawn from outside academia, teach special topics courses in their areas of expertise.|$|E
500|$|More {{than any}} other Midwestern state, Minnesota {{attracted}} engineers, especially <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>industry,</b> and became a center of technology after the war. [...] Engineering Research Associates was formed in 1946 to develop computers for the intelligence community. [...] It soon merged with Remington Rand, and later became Sperry Rand. [...] William Norris left Sperry in 1957 to form Control Data Corporation (CDC). [...] Cray Research was formed when Seymour Cray left CDC to form his own company. [...] Medical device maker Medtronic also was founded in the Twin Cities in 1949. Honeywell was a national player as well, until 1999 when it was bought out and its headquarters moved to New Jersey. [...] National firms, such as International Business Machines, operated large branch offices. IBM also operated a substantial manufacturing and development site in Rochester starting in 1956. [...] State government and powerful politicians such as Hubert Humphrey maintained a favorable climate. The University of Minnesota trained many computer specialists who decided {{to stay in the}} Minnesota rather than move to sunny California. [...] By the 1960s Minnesota thus became a successful precursor to Route 128 around Boston and Silicon Valley.|$|E

2500|$|On April 12, 1991, Apple CEO John Sculley {{performed}} a secret demonstration of Pink running on an PS/2 Model 70 to a delegation from IBM.

IBM was extremely interested, {{and over the next}} few months, the two companies formed an alliance to further development of the system. These efforts became public in early 1992, under the new name [...] "Taligent". At the time, Sculley summed up his concerns with Apple's own ability to ship Pink when he stated [...] "We want to be a major player <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>industry,</b> not a niche player.

2500|$|It is usual <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>computer</b> <b>industry</b> {{to specify}} {{password}} strength {{in terms of}} information entropy, measured in bits, a concept from information theory. Instead {{of the number of}} guesses needed to find the password with certainty, the base-2 logarithm of that number is given, which is the number of [...] "entropy bits" [...] in a password. A password with, say, 42 bits of strength calculated in this way would be as strong as a string of 42 bits chosen randomly, say by a fair coin toss. Put another way, a password with 42 bits of strength would require 242 attempts to exhaust all possibilities during a brute force search. Thus, adding one bit of entropy to a password doubles the number of guesses required, which makes an attacker's task twice as difficult. On average, an attacker will have to try half of the possible passwords before finding the correct one.|$|E
