5|$|The {{bodywork}} for {{the concept}} car displayed in 1988 was hand built from aluminium by Park Sheet Metal, a specialist automotive engineering company that manufactures concept cars and low-volume, niche models for various manufacturers, including Bentley. QCR Coatings undertook final {{painting of the}} bodyshell in silver. The concept also featured <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> scissor doors and a transparent engine cover {{to show off the}} V12 engine.|$|E
5|$|The B.1 {{had four}} {{elevators}} (inboard) and four ailerons (outboard). In the B.2, these {{were replaced by}} eight elevons. The Vulcan was also fitted with six <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> three-position (in, medium drag, high drag) airbrakes, four in the upper centre section and two in the lower. There were originally four lower airbrakes but the outboard two were deleted before the aircraft entered service. A brake parachute was installed inside the tail cone.|$|E
5|$|The main {{hydraulic}} system provided pressure for undercarriage raising and lowering and bogie trim; nosewheel centring and steering; wheelbrakes (fitted with Maxarets); bomb doors opening and closing; and (B.2 only) AAPP air scoop lowering. Hydraulic pressure {{was provided by}} three hydraulic pumps fitted to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines. An <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> hydraulic power pack (EHPP) {{could be used to}} operate the bomb doors and recharge the brake accumulators. A compressed air (later nitrogen) system was provided for emergency undercarriage lowering.|$|E
50|$|The {{windscreen}} {{was made}} from heat reflecting glass. All windows were <b>electrically</b> <b>operates</b> with additional controls for the driver. The roof had a transparent panel with an internal shutter.|$|R
5000|$|In 1898 British Electric Traction {{gained control}} of the company. Plans {{were put in place}} for {{modernisation}} and electrification of the system. The Worcester Tramways Act of 1901 and the Worcester (Extension) Light Railway Order of 1902 gave the British Electric Traction subsidiary company, Worcester Electric Traction Company, authority to upgrade, extend and <b>electrically</b> <b>operate</b> a [...] narrow gauge tramway.|$|R
30|$|Under partial shading, the PV cell <b>{{electrical}}ly</b> <b>operates</b> as load, and {{the electrical}} power {{is transformed into}} heat causing the increase of temperature. The high temperature can damage the PV cell or can melt the welding, a phenomenon known as hot spot. The hot spot phenomena {{can lead to the}} irreversible damage of the cell and an important reduction of module power performances. The in-depth analysis of the most common defects of PV modules was carried out in [1].|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the opening}} of the Bloor–Danforth line and the {{additional}} services that were required, a new set of trains were purchased from the Hawker Siddeley group. These trains, which were a part of the H-series, were similar to the M-1 series trains with newer features such as <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> doors. With the introduction of the T-1 series subway trains, the H-1 and H-2 subway trains were retired from service, while the remaining H-4 trains (along with some earlier T-1 series trains) were shifted to the Bloor–Danforth line.|$|E

25|$|Operating in {{the area}} until the 1950s was a network of <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> trolley buses which {{received}} their power from overhead power lines.|$|E
40|$|A {{method is}} {{disclosed}} {{that provides a}} self-aligned nitrogen-implant particularly suited for a Junction Field Effect Transistor (JFET) semiconductor device preferably comprised of a silicon carbide (SiC). This self-aligned nitrogen-implant allows for the realization of durable and stable electrical functionality of high temperature transistors such as JFETs. The method implements the self-aligned nitrogen-implant having predetermined dimensions, at a particular step in the fabrication process, so that the SiC junction field effect transistors are capable of being <b>electrically</b> <b>operating</b> continuously at 500. degree. C. for over 10, 000 hours in an air ambient {{with less than a}} 10 % change in operational transistor parameters...|$|R

25|$|The {{variant of}} Abruzzo and Molise, also called bilancia, often insists on {{shallower}} coasts and therefore {{is characterized by}} the presence of a platform, transversal to the coast, which is connected by a tight bridge made of wooden boards. A bilancia has just one winch, often <b>electrically</b> <b>operating,</b> even when the sea is perfectly calm. Abruzzo bilancia has also a net much smaller than that of Gargano trabucco, another feature that differentiates the two types is the length and number of antennae, more extensive Gargano (also double that of Abruzzo and Molise) in Termoli balances were more than two antennae, Gargano always two or more.|$|R

50|$|The {{morphology}} of the Gargano {{coast and}} of Abruzzo determined {{the presence of}} {{two different types of}} trabucco: the Garganic trabucco is usually anchored to a rocky platform, longitudinally extended to the coastline, from which the antennae depart.The variant of Abruzzo and Molise, also called bilancia, often insists on shallower coasts and therefore is characterized by the presence of a platform, transversal to the coast, which is connected by a tight bridge made of wooden boards. A bilancia has just one winch, often <b>electrically</b> <b>operating,</b> even when the sea is perfectly calm. Abruzzo bilancia has also a net much smaller than that of Gargano trabucco, another feature that differentiates the two types is the length and number of antennae, more extensive Gargano (also double that of Abruzzo and Molise) in Termoli balances were more than two antennae, Gargano always two or more.|$|R

25|$|Following {{experiments}} with Forest City type <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> {{points on the}} tram track at Woodborough Road and a set made by the Equipment and Engineering Company at the Queen Victoria Statue, a further eight of Forest City manufacture were purchased, enabling the release of 20 point boys.|$|E
25|$|The ring is 74 {{miles and}} {{includes}} 105 locks including 3 <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> river locks, 2 pairs of staircase locks and 2 broad locks. The route includes flights of locks at Tardebigge (x30), Stourbridge (x16) and the Black Delph at Brierley Hill (x8). The route also includes {{two of the}} longest navigable tunnels on the UK network, these being the Netherton and Wast Hills Tunnels.|$|E
40|$|Photocurable monomer-doped {{liquid crystal}} (LC) cells were {{processed}} via holographic exposure using a low-power He–Ne laser to generate holographic polymer networks. The polymer network LC (PNLC) cells {{are used to}} fabricate infrared phase modulators at 1550 nm wavelength possessing favorable electro-optical performance. Compared with our previous work, the percentages of ingredients in the LC mixture filled in PNLC cells underwent a slight change. The 2 wt% concentration of anisotropic monomer RM 257 were in place of isotropic monomer N–vinyl– 2 –pyrrolidinone (NVP). As a result, the fabricated phase modulators also maintained well homogeneous LC alignments and optical-scattering-free characteristics. Furthermore, NVP dopant successfully reduced the operating voltages from 95 Vrms to 79 Vrms to prevent polymer network deformation when <b>electrically</b> <b>operating</b> with higher voltages. The fabricated infrared phase modulators had a good average response time (i. e., rising time of 0. 88 ms and falling time of 0. 40 ms) ...|$|R

25|$|The Glasgow {{south side}} {{suburban}} service had been electrified by British Railways from 27 May 1962, when the Cathcart Circle, and Newton - Uddingston - Motherwell were <b>operated</b> <b>electrically.</b>|$|R
25|$|Because {{the station}} was built on a {{confined}} site, it was equipped with two <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> traversers at the buffer end of the platforms as a space saving measure, {{in order to allow}} locomotives to move sideways between tracks, instead of having to reverse through crossovers. The traversers were removed from service in 1967, when all services to the station switched to diesel multiple unit operation.|$|E
25|$|The Paisley and Barrhead District Railway was {{incorporated}} in 1897 {{and transferred to}} the Caledonian in 1902; it was to link Paisley and Barrhead and enable a circular service from Glasgow. The line was substantially ready in 1902 but by now street tramways were <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> and eminently successful. It was plain that a passenger service would not be viable against tram competition and the intended passenger service was never started.|$|E
25|$|The RMC was a coach {{version for}} Green Line routes. RMCs had {{modified}} suspension and interiors {{to allow a}} longer range and more comfortable running, an <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> door instead of an open platform, and a semi-automatic gearbox with higher gear ratios. The RCL was a long version of the RMC with a larger engine and similar coach-style features. Seating was provided for 57 on RMCs and 65 on RCLs.|$|E
50|$|The section between Türkismühle (line-kilometre 89.0) and Saarbrücken Hauptbahnhof {{has been}} {{electrified}} since 1969 and the Saarbrücken-Neunkirchen line via Fischbach-Camphausen (Fischbach Valley Railway) has been <b>operated</b> <b>electrically</b> since 1965.|$|R

50|$|The {{floating}} piston type includes <b>electrically</b> and manually <b>operated</b> subtypes. Both include {{a check valve}} {{at either end of}} the device to ensure the flow of fluids in only one direction.|$|R
25|$|The RMF and RMA {{class were}} {{production}} {{versions of the}} front entrance Routemaster, primarily for non-London and airline use. Like the RMC/RCL they had an <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> door, but {{at the front of}} the bus, along with the staircase. After being exhibited and demonstrated to other operators, the RMF attracted little interest, apart from an order from Northern General Transport Company (RMF) and, in a short version, from British European Airways (RMA).|$|E
25|$|The Huddersfield Broad Canal, {{originally}} the Sir John Ramsden Canal, and the Huddersfield Narrow Canal which are both navigable by narrowboat, and the broad canal by wider craft, wind around {{the south side}} of town. To the rear of the YMCA in the Turnbridge section is an <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> road bridge, which is still in use, to raise the road and allow boat traffic to pass. This bridge originally used a windlass.|$|E
25|$|While {{of similar}} {{size and weight}} to the {{aircraft}} discussed in the press, the Model T had unequal span wings, with the upper wing having a span of 134feet, while it was planned to be powered by four tractor 250hp (187kW) Curtiss V-4 engines installed, unusually for the time, individually on the middle wing. The two pilots and flight engineer were provided with an enclosed cabin, similar to the America, while to reduce control loads, small windmills could {{be connected to the}} aileron cables by <b>electrically</b> <b>operated</b> clutches to act as a form of power assisted controls.|$|E
50|$|A leap {{in thought}} {{occurred}} in the 1873 patent of the Schmoele brothers. They described a 'double valve' system that acted as a pneumatic amplifier, reading the roll <b>electrically</b> and <b>operating</b> the pneumatic with an electromagnet. They also exhibited at Philadelphia. With some modification, and pneumatic reading of the roll, this would become the final player piano some 20 years later, although the Schmoele brothers never benefited from it.|$|R
40|$|The {{orientation}} of the emissive dipole moments in organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) has {{a major impact on}} the optical outcoupling efficiency and, consequently, on the device performance as well as on possible optimization strategies. In this study we propose and demonstrate a general method to quantify the amounts of parallel and perpendicular emissive sites in OLEDs. The presented in situ-method is based on measurements of the far-field emission of an <b>electrically</b> <b>operating</b> device and corresponding optical reverse simulations. A well adapted OLED stack is utilized, where the contribution of perpendicularly oriented dipoles to the radiation pattern in air is optically enhanced. Additionally, for the reverse simulation we take advantage of the fact that perpendicular dipoles do contribute to transverse-magnetic polarized light emission only. We apply the method to a polymeric OLED and show that the radiation pattern is generated by 93. 5 % parallel and 6. 5 % perpendicular dipoles. Assuming a Gaussian distribution of dipole orientations, the dipoles stagger around the preferred parallel direction with an 1 /e-angle of +/- 22 degrees...|$|R
