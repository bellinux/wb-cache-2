5|$|As I {{look back}} on it today, I see the whole picture very differently. It's true that I hated missing out on Sexton. And the first few months, I was miserable at Everett. But being bused to Everett {{turned out to be one}} of the best things that ever {{happened}} to me. It <b>got</b> <b>me</b> out of my own little world and taught me how to understand white people, how to communicate and deal with them.|$|E
5|$|Shout-out to Mariah Carey and {{her whole}} squad and my boy Chris Lighty. He <b>got</b> <b>me</b> and Mariah together. I {{appreciate}} it. He {{put me on}} there as well as her. Both of them are smart for doing that. The song came out hard. Mariah knew I {{wanted to do a}} song with her. It finally happened, and it turned out hard. I just flew up there to New York, went in the studio with her. I flew right out and went back on the road. When I do a song with people, I like to really get in the studio with them so I could feel they swag and they could feel mine. The music comes out better.|$|E

25|$|Maroulis {{has been}} a regular {{contributor}} to the Loukoumi series of children's books by author Nick Katsoris, providing the voice of Gus the Bear. In July 2011, he joined forces with Disney/Fisher-Price to become spokesman for their latest interactive plush toy, Rock Star Mickey. In conjunction with this project, Maroulis released a new single, an updated version of the Kinks' classic You Really <b>Got</b> <b>Me.</b>|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Poker Face" [...] is {{all about}} sexual {{innuendo}} and teasing. According to Daily Star, the chorus repeats two alternating lyrics. After the hook [...] "Can't read my Poker Face" [...] the backup singer says [...] "He's <b>got</b> <b>me</b> like nobody" [...] {{and then in the}} next line says [...] "She's <b>got</b> <b>me</b> like nobody". Gaga explained in an interview with them that the line carries a bit of an undertone of confusion about love and sex. However, the liner notes from the album booklet indicate both these lines only repeat [...] "she's <b>got</b> <b>me</b> like nobody". According to BBC, the [...] "Mum-mum-mum-mah" [...] hook used in the song references Boney M.'s 1977 hit [...] "Ma Baker".|$|E

500|$|On April 11, 1992, Apollo 18 {{peaked at}} number 99 on the Billboard 200. It spent six weeks on that chart. [...] "The Statue <b>Got</b> <b>Me</b> High", {{the first single}} from the album, peaked at number 24 on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks chart on March 21, 1992, and spent eight weeks on the chart. The album's other singles failed to chart.|$|E
500|$|In the verses, Spears is {{flirting with}} a guy, in lyrics such as [...] "Look at you/Look at you/Be my sweetie/Be my honey tonight/Look at you/Look at you/Be my sweetie/Be my honey tonight/'Cause you're beautiful/Drop dead". Sabi rap's also {{alludes to the}} theme of the song, with lines such as [...] "I think I like you/Boy, boy, look at you/I want to get next to you/Got me kind of hot but I ain't {{sweating}} you/Steaming like a pot full of vegetables". Spears references The Notorious B.I.G.'s hit [...] "Hypnotize" [...] in [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] in the line [...] "You must be B.I.G. because you <b>got</b> <b>me</b> Hypnotized". Spears' vocals on [...] "(Drop Dead) Beautiful" [...] were deemed as [...] "robotic", but similar to the ones of [...] "Oops!... I Did It Again" [...] (2000). Jocelyn Vena of MTV noted the singer uses her deep vocals in lines such as [...] "And, yeah, your body looks so sick, I think I caught the flu" [...] and [...] "You must be B.I.G. 'cause you <b>got</b> <b>me</b> hypnotized".|$|E

500|$|After quitting his {{previous}} job, Tsamere {{took part in}} the Déclic Théâtre improvisation group under its co-founder Alain [...] "Papy" [...] Degois, who he said [...] "pushed me, gave me confidence, coddled me [...] <b>got</b> <b>me</b> to act in plays and improvisation matches". Between 2003 and 2005, he played the baron Christian de Neuvillette in an adaptation of Cyrano de Bergerac at the Château de Gizeux with the theatre group La Pastière, to which he was introduced by Degois.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from his}} fondness for meat, Adkins {{claimed to have}} but three loves in life, [...] "girls, guitars, and cars. All three of [...] <b>got</b> <b>me</b> into trouble over the years." [...] One such {{incident}} occurred in 1957 when he and three friends drove a car off a mountain. A local newspaper reported the car tumbled 70 feet into nearby Pond Fork. While the driver died at the scene, Adkins survived, although he sustained a permanent back injury.|$|E
500|$|The band {{appeared}} as a musical guest on numerous talk shows to promote Apollo 18. [...] "The Guitar (The Lion Sleeps Tonight)" [...] and [...] "The Statue <b>Got</b> <b>Me</b> High" [...] were performed on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno and [...] "I Palindrome I" [...] on Late Night with David Letterman.

500|$|The {{theme of}} [...] "failed or betrayed friendship", in Leng's words, is most evident {{midway through the}} third verse, with the lines [...] "You've <b>got</b> <b>me</b> {{wondering}} how I lost your friendship / But I see it in your eyes". Doggett interprets this statement as reflecting Harrison's [...] "decaying relationship" [...] with McCartney at the time. Lennon too had been a friend of Harrison's since school days, and Leng includes him {{as a source of}} Harrison's [...] "minibereavement" [...] at the Beatles' impending demise.|$|E
500|$|Planer {{suggests}} that the [...] "searing" [...] verse-two lines [...] "You thought you had <b>got</b> <b>me</b> in your grip / Baby, looks like you was not so smart" [...] are a further example of this interpretation. Like Planer, Inglis recognises a third possible target of Harrison's scorn – former bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney. Inglis observes that in the song's final verse, Harrison is making it clear {{to those who have}} underestimated him in the past that his abilities are not [...] "recent acquisitions": ...|$|E
500|$|Weird Al also <b>got</b> <b>me.</b> He made a video, did a fake {{interview}} with me, spliced it with clips from my old interviews, {{and put it}} up on the Internet. He's a very funny motherfucker. When something like that happens, you have to sit back and say, [...] "Oh, he got me." [...] It's something you pick up from battles: you learn to be a good sport about a lot of stuff. If you want to dish it out, you've {{got to be able to}} take it.|$|E

500|$|Kimberly Roots, {{writing for}} TV Line, {{responded to the}} kiss scene by stating, [...] "What <b>got</b> <b>me</b> – and still gets me – about this kiss is how much fire it has. This isn’t a drunken, {{convenient}} hook-up. This isn’t a let’s-see-how-this-goes peck. This is two people acting on years of something unacknowledged between them. We get a long moment of LoVe in action before they break apart and realize what just happened." [...] Entertainment Weekly called [...] "Weapons of Class Destruction" [...] one of the [...] "10 essential episodes of Veronica Mars".|$|E
500|$|Texans {{knew of the}} {{oil that}} lay beneath {{the ground in the}} state for decades, but this was often seen more as a problem than a benefit because it {{hindered}} the digging of water wells. Rancher William Thomas Waggoner (1852–1934), who later became an influential oil businessman in Fort Worth, struck oil while drilling for water in 1902. He was quoted as having said, [...] "I wanted water, and they <b>got</b> <b>me</b> oil. I tell you I was mad, mad clean through. We needed water for ourselves and for our cattle to drink." ...|$|E
500|$|After three romantic comedies, Siddharth Anand {{wanted his}} next film to be a romance, yet {{different}} from the usual films which were being made at the time. Anand felt he {{had run out of}} plot ideas, believing he was writing just [...] "another story". His wife Mamta then came up with the core narrative concept about [...] "two suicidal strangers meeting and falling in the love". Anand revealed that this changed his viewpoint, saying: [...] "It was a scene that <b>got</b> <b>me</b> completely excited and we started writing immediately. It's a scene that dictates the story." ...|$|E
