The definitive version is available at: [URL] paper investigates automotive transmission gear rattle. Specifically, <b>idle</b> <b>gear</b> <b>rattle,</b> where the repetitive impacts of teeth are subject to light loads is investigated. Hydrodynamic regime of lubrication prevails in lightly loaded impact of teeth pairs. Formation of a lubricant film is due to the combined entraining motion of the lubricant and squeeze film effect. A lumped parameter inertial dynamic model, comprising hydrodynamic impact and flank friction for pairs of simultaneous teeth pairs of loose gears is developed. The overall dynamic model includes seven loose gear pairs and rigid body lateral motions of input and output transmission shafts. Therefore, the influence of fluid film behaviour on <b>idle</b> <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> is determined, which has hitherto not attracted sufficient research studies. Gear rattle is manifested by a vibration signature, which corresponds to the bands of frequencies due to torsional engine oscillations, meshing frequencies, and impact characteristics of lubricated conjunctions. The spectral contributions are affected by lubricant rheology, specifically its bulk viscosity variation with temperature. It has been found that spectral disposition tends towards lower frequency contributions with reducing lubricant viscosity because of rising temperatures and lowering lubricant stiffness. The findings conform with the experimental results, also reported in the paper. It has also been shown that squeeze film motion plays {{a significant role in the}} propensity of transmission system to rattle...|$|E
40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Gear rattle is caused by engine torsional vibration (engine order response) imparted to the transmission components, further causing the gears to oscillate within their functional backlashes. These oscillations lead to the repetitive impact of gear teeth, which lead to noisy responses, referred to as gear rattle. The lack of in-depth research into the effect of lubricant on gear rattle {{has been identified as}} a deficiency in the previous research in rattle. The aim ofthe current work is to address this shortcoming. The thesis outlines a new approach in investigating the problem of <b>idle</b> <b>gear</b> <b>rattle.</b> The approach {{is based on the assumption}} that under idling condition the teeth-pair impact loads are sufficiently low and the gear speeds are sufficiently high to permit the formation of a hydrodynamic lubricant film between the mating gear teeth. This film acts as a non-linear spring-damper that couples the driver and the driven gears. A torsional single-degree of freedom model is used in the development of the theory. The model is then expanded into a seven-degree of freedom torsional model and finally into an Il-degree of freedom model that also includes the lateral vibrations of the supporting shafts. The Il-degree of freedom model is based on a real life transmission that is also used in experimental studies to validate the model. It is found that lubricant viscosity and bearing clearance (lubricant resistance in squeeze) play important roles in determining the dynamics of the system and its propensity to rattle. At low temperatures, the lateral vibrations of the shafts, carrying the gears interfere with the gear teeth impact action. The severity of rattle is determined by the relationship between the entraining and squeeze film actions of the hydrodynamic film. When the latter dominates, the system can rattle more severely. The numerical results are found to correlate well with the experimental findings obtained from vehicle tests in a semi-anechoic chamber and also with those from a transmission test rig in the powertrain laboratory...|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} work, {{experimental data}} {{have demonstrated the}} severity of <b>idling</b> <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> depends {{not only on the}} amplitude, but also the phase of an external sinusoidal forcing. One possible explanation for this is in small tooth profile errors. In this paper, we investigate this hypothesis, by deriving an equation of motion incorporating an error function and losses at the mesh interface, values of which are obtained from experimental data. By solving the equations of motion, theoretical <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> trajectories are obtained. Theoretical and experimental trajectories are then compared, by way of time domain plots as well as via contour plots linking the amplitude of backlash oscillation to the amplitude and phase of input forcing. For most profile error functions, good agreement is achieved between the model and experimental data. In the case where the profile errors are dominated by misalignment between the gear and shaft centres agreement is less good and suggestions of areas of further study required for model refinement are proposed. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Component {{sound quality}} is an {{important}} factor in the design of competitive diesel engines. One component noise that causes complaints is the <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> that originates in the front-of-engine gear train which drives the fuel pump and other accessories. The rattle is caused by repeated tooth impacts resulting from fluctuations in differential torsional acceleration of the driving gears. These impacts generate a broadband, impulsive noise that is often perceived as annoying. In most previous work, the overall sound quality of diesel engines has been considered without specifically focusing on predicting the perception of <b>gear</b> <b>rattle.</b> <b>Gear</b> <b>rattle</b> level has been quantified based on angular acceleration measurements, but those measurements can be difficult to perform. Here, the emphasis was on developing a metric based on subjective testing of the perception of <b>gear</b> <b>rattle.</b> In the first part of the present work, a method to simulate <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> noise and incorporate it into a no-gear-rattle (baseline) recording was developed.

40|$|Sound {{quality is}} an {{important}} factor in the design of competitive diesel engines. The noise produced by specific components and mechanisms in the engine can play a significant role in determining the perceived quality of the overall noise and in turn the perceived quality of the engine. The goal of the present research is to characterize the sounds produced by the phenomenon known as <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> and to develop a model that can be used to assess <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> levels in a way that connects directly with human perception of rattle. Most previous work in this area has been focused on rating the overall sound quality of diesel engines, but little has been done to develop models of perception of rattle noise in particular. Various engine recordings in which <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> was present were first compiled. These signals were analyzed to identify how sounds changed with increased levels of rattle. A method to simulate <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> noise and incorporate it into a no-gear-rattle (baseline) recording was developed.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a research work on driveline modeling, torsional vibration analysis, and clutch damper parameters optimization for reducing transmission <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> on the vehicle creeping condition. Firstly, major driveline components, including quasi-transient engine, multistage stiffness clutch damper, detailed manual transmission and differential mechanism, and LuGre tire, are modeled, respectively. Secondly, powertrain system modeling adopting a two-stage stiffness clutch damper is constructed and analyzed. Transient responses {{predicted by the}} model show that the driveline undergoes severe torsional vibration and transmission <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> phenomenon. By analysis, it is concluded that the clutch damper works jumping between the first- and second-stage stiffness, which results in this problem for the creeping condition. Then, a three-stage stiffness clutch damper is proposed innovatively to solve this problem.

Several details of the mechanism of gear lubrication are still in doubt in spite of many decades of study of this subject. The focus of our work is {{the investigation of the}} mechanism by which oil temperature variations affect <b>gear</b> <b>idle</b> <b>rattle,</b> which requires an understanding of the distributions of lubricant and heat within a gearbox. This paper presents the findings of a study of lubricant flow in a simple model gearbox by means of CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) and its validation by a series of tests on a spur gear rig. The commercial CFD code Fluent is used to simulate the splash flow of lubricant, using the techniques of dynamic meshing and VOF (Volume of Fluid). Our model takes into account the effects on the distribution of gear lubricant of lubricant level and physical properties as well as rotational speed. The results demonstrate that the flow patterns are strongly influenced by all these variables. The predictions are validated by high-speed flow visualisations using high-resolution imaging in conjunction with a pulsed Cu-vapour laser light source and powerful white light source. The simulated fluid flows are in good qualitative agreement with the experimental visualisation...|$|R
40|$|LTDS and VIBRATEC {{founded the}} Labcom LADAGE (gears {{dynamics}} joint laboratory). One of its {{goals is to}} develop numerical methods and simulation tools for predicting gears dynamics, {{in order to take}} account of multiphysics couplings between internal and external excitations and to follow the evolution of industrial demand towards more and more complex systems. The operation of a combustion engine is such that it generates a cyclic disturbance of the circular motion of the gearbox primary shaft. Coupled with internal excitations, this disturbance can generate losses of contact at the loaded gear pair. Corresponding vibroimpacts regimes are responsible of the gearbox hammering noise. The irregular rotation of the motor is also sufficient for generating loss of contact of unloaded gears, such as idler gears of an automotive gearbox. Corresponding vibroimpacts regimes are responsible of the gearbox rattle noise. Two different approaches can be retained to describe the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of mechanisms with contact and backlash nonlinearities, depending on the intensity of the vibroimpact pulses and contact duration. Hammering noise For high level pulses, the contact duration of successive vibroimpacts is long. A nonlinear dynamic model is introduced, taking into account both the gear backlash and the contact stiffness nonlinearities. Solving the equations of motion requires the implementation of specific methods dedicated to nonlinear problems. For example, the finite difference method is used in order to obtain the periodic solutions. They are followed up according to a parameter control, thanks to a pseudoarc length continuation method. Indeed, this approach has proven very efficient for studying multifrequency excitations. A direct integration time method is also used in order to compare obtained results. Eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix inform us about their loss of local stability and {{about the nature of the}} bifurcations that occur. This first approach is well suited to characterize the hammering noise of a truck timing multistage gear. A large variety of dynamic behaviours have been identified. In addition to periodic responses, pseudoperiodic and chaotic ones are highlighted. Multiple impacts per period of excitation are observed. These nonlinear responses occur at resonances and instability regions. Then, the adding effect of the engine torque fluctuation is considered. The dynamic behaviour of the two-stage gear train becomes more complex. Vibroimpact regimes are observed over a wide range of operating conditions. Rattle noise A second approach is retained for low level pulses. The contact duration of successive vibroimpacts is very short. They are described in a more simple way, using a coefficient of restitution. The dynamic response of the system is built piecewisely by solving the equations of motion for the free flight periods. New initial conditions are introduced after each impact, derived from the dynamic response just before impact. This second approach is particularly well suited to characterize the rattle noise due to nonlinear dynamic behaviour of <b>idle</b> <b>gears</b> of an automotive gearbox. In addition to the gearbox design parameters and the engine operating conditions, the dynamic response of <b>idle</b> <b>gears</b> depends on the drag torque applied to the <b>idle</b> <b>gear</b> and the coefficient of restitution. They are identified experimentally through implementation of optical encoders in an actual automotive gearbox and the operation of a specific test bench which replicates the automotive power train. Models of the different drag torque sources are validated from analysis of the free damped response of the drivelines. The coefficient of restitution and its probability density function are measured from further experiments under stationary operating conditions. A nonlinear model of the dynamic response of <b>idle</b> <b>gears</b> is built. The key parameters are the dimensionless backlash, the coefficient of restitution and a dimensionless parameter proposed to describe the rattle excitation level. Periodic, pseudoperiodic and chaotic responses including impacts between active flanks and reverse flanks are observed. Experiments under controlled excitation are performed to validate the assumptions, to confirm the ability of the proposed parameter to describe the rattle noise threshold, and to characterize the dynamic behaviour of the <b>idle</b> <b>gear.</b> Predictions are fitted with the drag torque and coefficient of restitution previously identified. Comparisons with measurements demonstrate the ability of the model to predict <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> for any <b>idle</b> <b>gear,</b> any gearbox and any operating condition...|$|R

The excitation of <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> is of periodic type with two harmonic components, which is similar to the excitation of an actual automotive I. C. engine. The dynamic behavior of the gear pair has been analyzed by varying the second order harmonic amplitude of the excitation, for two mean speed values.

40|$|We {{consider}} the automotive gearbox rattle noise resulting from vibro-impacts {{that can occur}} between the <b>idle</b> <b>gears</b> under excessive velocity fluctuations of the shaft-driving gears imposed by engine torque fluctuation. Even if the rattling phenomenon has no consequence on reliability, it may be particularly annoying for vehicle interior sound quality and acoustic comfort. The main parameters governing such kind of vibrations are the excitation source associated with engine torque fluctuation which can be modeled by an imposed displacement of the driveline, the inertia of the <b>idle</b> <b>gear,</b> the drag torque acting during the free flight motion, and the impact laws. In the case of rattle, {{it is reasonable to}} assume that duration of impacts between teeth is very short compared to the excitation period. Then, these impacts are modeled by a coefficient of restitution law. The excitation source is not composed only with fundamental component but also with other harmonic components.

For the sake of illustration, a particular problem for a light duty truck is studied in this paper and dynamic interactions are investigated. Some experimental measurements are first presented to define the unloaded <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> problem. Linear and non-linear mathematical models of the driveline are developed to understand, quantify and control the rattle problem.

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> induced by multi-harmonic excitation. The analysis is conducted by an experimental point of view. The excitation of <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> in the automotive gear box derives from the law of speed of the I. C. engine and is generally of periodic type. Many analyses consider a sinusoidal law of speed, but a multiharmonic excitation, as a sum of two harmonic components how that adopted in the paper, could be more realistic for the study. An interesting behavior has been observed in the gears when varying the second order harmonic amplitude of the excitation.

40|$|Noise and {{vibration}} {{properties of}} products have become important {{functions in the}} competition between different manufacturers and are seen today as indicators {{for the quality of}} the product. In this work, a new approach is presented for the localisation of impulse sources in complex structures, e. g. engines, driving units or complete vehicles. The approach is based on a correlation technique similar to methods used in radar techniques. The method is developed for an engineering application aiming on the detection of <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> in gearboxes. <b>Gear</b> <b>rattle</b> occurs in gearboxes and is caused by relative motion between acting gearwheels. <b>Gear</b> <b>rattle</b> depends on the play between the gearwheels, the loading and the overall dynamics of the system. <b>Gear</b> <b>rattle</b> can, under certain speed and loading conditions, dominate the total emitted noise from a truck. The proposed analysis method is based on the idea to measure impulse response functions (so called characteristic signals) from possible source locations to a receiving point {{on the surface of the}} structure, e. g. the casing of a gearbox. These characteristic signals are compared with vibration measurements when the analysis object is running and impulse sources are active (e. g. rattle impacts between cogwheels). The comparison is done by calculating the correlation coefficient between the characteristic signals and the measured vibrations in the receiving point. It is shown that this correlation coefficient corresponds to the maximum likelihood function and can, from defined perspectives, be seen as the best estimator to decide which of all possible sources is responsible for the vibrations in the receiving point. A substantial part of the work is devoted to the discussion of the quality of the decision based on the correlation coefficient. The problem is extended to the case of unknown arrival time and the presence of noise in the measured signals. From the theoretical background of the suggested methods, engineering solutions are suggested to handle the complex task to detect rattle source in gearbox under different driving conditions. The function of the method is demonstrated for both a modified gearbox under well-controlled conditions in a test rig and for a gearbox in a complete truck. It is shown that the method is a good tool for locating rattle sources in complex structures. It provides information concerning the location as well as the intensity of the impulse sources...|$|R

The spring element of the damper is constituted by a Magneto-Rheological elastomer, at which a suitable magnetic field can be applied in order to change its modulus and so the dynamical characteristics of the damper. The magnetic field can be varied by controlling the current in a coil surrounding the elastomeric element.

The effects of higher harmonics of driving torque are studied by numerical analysis. As a result, the followings were made clear. (1) In the resonance region of lower mode, when the frequency of driving torque is nearly equal to the one which is the natural frequency of higher mode divided by some integer, the response contains the higher mode and its amplitude of acceleration becomes large. However this phenomenon is not so affected by the higher harmonics of driving torque. (2) First harmonic of driving torque generates higher harmonic resonance and higher harmonic of driving torque generates the main resonance, hence the interaction of these two resonances makes the amplitude of the resonance large. (3) Because of interaction of higher harmonics of driving torque and mesh stiffness variation, resonances like gear noise occur with many side-bands in low frequency region, and {{the region of the}} rattles becomes wide.

50|$|Unlike {{any other}} type of transmission, {{non-synchronous}} transmissions often have a mechanism for slowing down, or stopping an <b>idle</b> <b>gear.</b> In commercial motor vehicles, this mechanism is called the clutch brake, and is used by depressing the clutch {{all the way to the}} floor, or pressing a button on the top of the gear lever. This is useful in 18-wheelers that have just started their diesel engines, and are releasing parking locks, and engaging the transmission from a stop. The clutch brake not only slows or stops the <b>idle</b> <b>gear</b> axis, but can also prevent shifting into gear until the clutch pedal is released a few inches off the floor. In order to shift into gear, the clutch must be half way off the floor, otherwise the clutch brake will prevent the transmission from being shifted into or out of gear. Mechanics must often repair or replace the clutch brake in a non-synchronous transmission when an inexperienced operator wears it out, it becomes inoperable, or has lost its function.|$|R

The technique adopts the discrete wavelet transform (DWT), following the Multi-resolution analysis, to decompose an experimental signal of the relative angular motion of gears into an approximation and in some detail vectors. The described procedure, previously developed by the authors, permits the qualitative evaluation of the impacts occurring between the teeth by examining in particular the detail vectors coming out from the wavelet decomposition.

Analysis is performed by comparing three different lubrication conditions, and some of the classical wavelet functions adopted in literature are tested as "mother" wavelet. Moreover, comparisons with a metric based on the harmonic analysis by means of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), often adopted in this field, are conducted to put in evidence the advantages of the Wavelet technique with reference to the influence of some fundamental operative parameters.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the modelling of <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> in Roots blower vacuum pumps. Analysis of experimental data reveals that the source of the noise and vibration problem is the backlash nonlinearity due to gear teeth losing and re-establishing contact. We derive simple non-smooth models for the lightly damped, lightly loaded dynamics of the pump. The models include a time-dependent forcing term which arises from the eccentric mounting of the gears acting at the gross rotation rate. We use a combination of explicit construction, asymptotic methods and numerical techniques to classify complicated dynamic behaviour in realistic parametric regimes. We first present a linear analysis of permanent-contact motions, and derive upper bounds on eccentricity for silent operation. We then develop a nonlinear analysis of ‘backlash oscillations’, where the gears lose and re-establish contact, corresponding to noisy pump operation. We show that noisy solutions can coexist with silent ones, explaining why <b>geared</b> systems can <b>rattle</b> intermittently. Finally, we consider possible design solutions, and show implications for pump design in terms of existence and stability of solutions. <br/...|$|R

40|$|The “gear rattle” {{phenomenon}} {{is a research}} topic of great interest for the NVH (Noise, Vibration and Harshness) automotive sector, concerning driveline noise and vibrations coming from the manual gear boxes. It {{is due to the}} internal combustion engine variable torque producing impacts and rebounds, and consequently noise, between the teeth of the unloaded gear pairs of the gear box because of the unavoidable presence of backlashes. Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) is used to decompose the angular relative motion signal and the wavelet decomposition details are adopted to analyze the dynamic behaviour of <b>gears</b> under <b>rattle</b> conditions. The DWT has been chosen because it is a particularly suitable instrument to recognize discontinuities, such as jumps or instantaneous changes in the slope of the signals, due to their localization in the time domain. Wavelet analysis allows to characterize an event by the localization, the kind, and the amplitude of the event. This technique enables, moreover, to define new indices for metrics of <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> especially useful in order to conduct comparisons among different operative conditions. Some examples of application of the proposed technique are reported in the paper. The theoretical investigations regard comparative analysis with respect to the amplitude and to the frequency of speed fluctuations and to the gears lubrication regime...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} an efficient transient elastohydrodynamic simulation method for gear contacts. The model uses oil films and elastic deformations {{directly in the}} multibody simulation, {{and is based on}} the Reynolds equation including squeeze and wedge terms as well as an elastic half-space. Two transient solutions to this problem, an analytical and a numerical one, were developed. The analytical solution is accomplished using assump-tions for the gap shape and the pressure {{in the middle of the}} gap. The numerical problem is solved using multilevel multi-integration algorithms. With this approach, tooth impacts during <b>gear</b> <b>rattling</b> as well as highly loaded power-transmitting gear contacts can be investigated and lubrication conditions like gap heights or type of friction may be deter-mined. The method was implemented in the multibody simulation environment SIMPACK. Therefore it is easy to transfer the developed element to other models and use it for a multitude of different engineering problems. A detailed three-dimensional elastic multi-body model of an experimental transmission is used to validate the developed method. Important values of the gear contact like normal and tangential forces, proportion of dry friction, and minimum gap heights are calculated and studied for different conditions. In addition, pressure distributions on tooth flanks as well as gap forms are determined based on the numerical solution method. Finally, the simulation approach is validated with measurements and shows good consistency. The simulation model is therefore capable of predicting transient gear contact under different operating conditions such as load vibra-tions or <b>gear</b> <b>rattling.</b> Simulations of complete transmissions are possible and therefore a direct determination of transmission vibration behavior and structure-borne noise as well as of forces and lubrication conditions can be done.

60|$|Most of {{the iron}} storm passed close {{by the head of}} the pirate. However, only one ball took effect; it touched the end of the bowsprit, and sent the {{jib-boom}} into the air in splinters. Manton applied the match to the brass gun almost at the same moment, and the heavy ringing roar of her explosion seemed like a prolonged echo of the broadside. The gun was well aimed; but the schooner had already passed so far behind the point, that the ball struck a projecting part of the cliff; dashed it into atoms, and, glancing upwards, passed through the cap of the Talisman's mizzen-mast, and brought the lower yard, with all its <b>gear,</b> <b>rattling</b> down on the quarter-deck. When the smoke cleared away, the Avenger had vanished from the scene.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the modelling of <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> in Roots blower vacuum pumps. Analysis of experimental data reveals that the source of the noise and vibration problem is the backlash nonlinearity due to gear teeth losing and re-establishing contact. We develop nonsmooth ordinary differential equation models for the dynamics of the pump. The models include a time-dependent forcing term which arises from the imperfect, eccentric mounting of the gears. We use a combination of explicit construction, asymptotic methods and numerical techniques to classify complicated dynamic behaviour in realistic parametric regimes. We first present a linear analysis of motions where the gears do not lose contact, and develop upper bounds on eccentricity for quiet operation. We then develop a nonlinear analysis of ‘backlash oscillations’, where the gears lose and re-establish contact, corresponding to noisy pump operation. It is found that noisy solutions can coexist with silent ones, explaining why <b>geared</b> systems can <b>rattle</b> intermittently. We then consider several possible design solutions, and show their implications for pump design in terms of the existence and stability of silent and noisy solutions. Finally, we present conclusions and possibilities for future work...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Torque {{fluctuation}} {{of engine}} generate <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> noise of transmission and many researches {{have been studied}} to decrease rattle noise by adjusting clutch damper system. So design optimization of clutch system {{is very important to}} decrease rattle noise and need knowing clutch dynamic torque at real vehicle driving condition. This makes it possible to measure clutch dynamic torque by using a small-size magnetic sensor. We install a small-size magnetic sensor on the input shaft of the transmission and measure the relative angular displacement between clutch hub and disc plate. We can obtain the clutch torque correspond to the angular displacement in the clutch torsional characteristics test. The object of this research is to measure clutch dynamic torque on real vehicle condition. Therefore, Clutch dynamic torque is very useful for investigating operating range of clutch according to engine torque an...|$|R
40|$|To design new {{and high}} tech {{products}} the engineers rely {{more and more}} on computer based simulations to investigate the properties and behavior for a component or system. To verify these computer based simulations the dynamic properties for the components of the drivetrain needs to be verified. Therefore measurements of the stiffness and vibrations for the rear axle has been performed. This report show how the measurements has been implemented and evaluated, along with some interesting results for the rear axles properties. The static stiffness for the drive shaft along with the axle-gear has been determined. It is found that the stiffness for the whole rear axle is near the stiffness for the drive shaft, which means that the drive shaft becomes the dominant component of the system and affects the rear axle stiffness the most. The measured stiffness of the driveshaft is close to its theoretical stiffness. The stiffness for solely the hypoid-gear have been calculated using the stiffness for the rear axle and driveshaft, and thus has a range for the stiffness of the hypoid gear been determined. The backlash for the whole rear axle and for some individual components has been determined, where the backlash between pinion and crown-wheel has negligible impact on the total backlash. Measurements of the crown-wheel and pinion movements have been conducted, where the direction of movement is consistent with the theoretical direction of the forces. The vibration measurements show that the vibrations are more severe at certain rotational speeds. These vibrations can be due to the resonant frequency of the rear axle. An attempt to measure the <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> for the current rear axle has been conducted and the results for the measurements show a hint that <b>gear</b> <b>rattle</b> has occurred at certain speeds. The FFT-analysis shows that {{a large part of the}} vibrations is caused by the mesh-frequency and its orders. Validerat; 20140610 (global_studentproject_submitter...|$|R
