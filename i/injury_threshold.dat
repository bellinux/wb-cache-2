40|$|Pedestrian {{safety is}} a serious global problem {{that needs to be}} {{addressed}} by drivers, vehicle manufacturers and researchers. Since the first European Committee directive for pedestrian safety was published, vehicle suppliers have implemented pedestrian protection requirements to automobile structures at the design level. As to the development of current automobile front-end structures, a question arises about pedestrian safety: are there existing injury criteria for the new generation of cars? Most previous <b>injury</b> <b>thresholds</b> for knee ligaments were principally based on isolated sub-segment tests with contrived loading conditions, and rarely took the entire front-end shape of the car model into account to simulate realistic pedestrian loading conditions. Hence, the current study aims to investigate <b>injury</b> <b>thresholds</b> of primary knee ligament injuries in car–pedestrian impact environments as well as to evaluate the previous criteria proposed by isolated sub-segment tests. The entire front-end shape of a car model was employed. A parametric study of various pedestrian loading conditions was implemented by finite element simulations regarding three influencing factors: impact heights, locations of impact and impact velocities. Finally, the <b>injury</b> <b>thresholds</b> associated with primary knee ligament injuries of pedestrians were defined with the dominant injury mechanisms: combined lateral bending and shearing effects. These thresholds are also well correlated with the previous criteria defined by isolated lower limb tests...|$|R

Oftentimes this distinction is straightforward, but many times probabilities of injuries from accidental scenarios are unknown making the differential diagnosis difficult. For example, it is unknown whether intracranial hemorrhage (IH) can occur at a location other than a focal contact site following a low height fall. To create a foundation for predicting regional IH in infants, we sought to identify the biomechanical response and <b>injury</b> <b>threshold</b> best able to predict IH in 3 – 5 day old piglets. First, finite element (FE) model simulations of in situ animal studies were performed to ascertain the optimal representation of the pia-arachnoid complex, cerebrospinal fluid and cortical vasculature (PCC) for predicting brain strain and brain/skull displacement. Second, rapid head rotations resulting in various degrees of IH were simulated (n = 24) to determine the biomechanical predictor and <b>injury</b> <b>threshold</b> most closely correlated with IH. FE models representing the PCC with either spring connectors or solid elements between the brain and skull resulted in peak brain strain and brain/skull displacement similar to measured values in situ. However, when predicting IH, the spring connector representation of the PCC had the best predictive capability for IH with a sensitivity of 80 % and a specificity of 85 % when ≥ 1 % of all spring connectors had at least a peak strain of 0. 31 mm/mm.

"Operators {{of mobile}} {{construction}} equipment (e. g., bulldozers, scrapers, etc.) often opt to descend {{out of the}} cabin in an irregular fashion without using proper egress methods, despite being trained on proper egress methods. The main objective {{of this research was}} to quantify and compare the effect of arm posture, landing style, and descent height on ground reaction forces, and acceleration at the ankle and knee by performing a laboratory study. Fifteen male subjects descended from three different descent heights (38. 1, 50. 8, and 63. 5 cm) using three different arm postures (arms to the side, arms front, and arms crossed) and landing on both legs at the same time, right leg first, and left leg first. The results demonstrated that with the increase in descent heights, the ground reaction forces, and accelerations at the ankle and knee increased. Landing with the arms out stretched horizontally in front of the body (arms front) resulted in higher ground reaction forces, peak resultant acceleration at the knee, and higher transmissibility between the ankle and the knee compared to the arms hanging {{to the side of the}} body. Although having the arms out front when landing may slightly reduce impact forces, this posture may help in maintaining balance upon landing. Landing with “both legs at same time” increased the GRF, whereas landing on one leg first followed by the other leg seemed to distribute the landing force over a longer period of time. Landing on one or two legs at the heights tested in this study resulted in ground reaction forces lower than <b>injury</b> <b>threshold</b> values for the ankle from previous research. However, descending from higher heights may result in impact forces approaching or exceeding <b>injury</b> <b>threshold</b> levels.

40|$|Impact induced {{traumatic}} brain injury (ITBI) describes brain injury from head impact not necessarily accompanied by skull fracture. For sufficiently abrupt head impact decelerations, ITBI results from brain tissue stress incurred as the brain crashes into {{the inside of the}} skull wall, displacing the surrounding cerebral spinal fluid (CSF). Proper helmet cushioning can damp the impact force and reduce ITBI. But force is mass times acceleration and commonly used helmet blunt impact standards are based only on acceleration thresholds. Here I show how this implies that present standards overestimate the minimum acceleration onset for ITBI by implicitly assuming that the brain is mechanically decoupled from the body. I quantify how an arbitrary orientation of the body with respect to impact direction increases the effective mass that should be used in calculating the required damping force and <b>injury</b> <b>threshold</b> accelerations.

A unique database was built from autopsy reports and accident investigations combining injury data with the vehicle impact data. Computer models were created and used to assess injury potential. Common design limits and actual crash data from full scale research experiments were used as inputs. The results were analyzed according to published <b>injury</b> <b>thresholds</b> and compared with real accident autopsies to determine the validity of the hypothesis. Heart and Aortic Injury (HAI) has been considered a critical survivability factor through out the history of mechanized transportation. The mechanisms of HAI in the aircraft environment were never well characterized. Automotive research identified important HAI injury mechanisms related to the forward and lateral impact vectors. This research investigated the vertical impact vector. A model was developed to evaluate the biomechanical response of a simplified visco-elastic system, and incorporated into a system model which included the occupant and aircraft seat. This approach was similar to the development of spine injury criteria and provided the advantage of a macro level evaluation of the <b>injury</b> <b>thresholds</b> and assessment of the criticality in survivable accidents. Evaluations of real accidents sustaining HAI characterized a range of impact severity and approximate boundaries for survivability with HAI and internal organ injury. Viscous injury potential from vertical impact was found to be less critical than potential spine injury. Detailed analysis of HAI documented in autopsy reports and the corresponding accident investigations found that HAI was associated with cockpit environmental factors rather than inertial displacement mechanisms. Vertical displacement of the heart due to inertial loads is not a critical factor in survivable accidents given current aircraft technology. Inertial loading to the heart and aorta is a contributory factor for viscous injuries in aircraft accidents. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

Secondly, when the density of pest population x(t) is at the economic threshold h_ 2 (0 < h_ 1 < h_ 2), only releasing the natural enemy cannot reduce the damage. Therefore, certain pesticide has to be sprayed and the natural enemy released at the same time.

40|$|Blast induced {{neurotrauma}} (BINT) {{has been}} designated as the “signature injury” to warfighters in the recent military conflicts. The occurrence of traumatic brain injury (TBI) in blasts is controversial in the medical and scientific communities because the manifesting symptoms occur without visible injuries. Whether the primary blast waves alone can cause mechanical insult that is comparable to existing traumatic brain <b>injury</b> <b>thresholds</b> is still an open question, and this work is aimed to address this issue. In {{the first part of}} this dissertation, mechanics of primary blast loading on Realistic Explosive Dummy (RED) head with and without helmets is studied using experiments and a validated numerical model. It is shown that geometry of the head and helmet, their configurations and orientations with respect to the direction of the blast govern the flow dynamics around the head; these factors in turn determine the surface pressures. The blast wave can focus under the helmet if there is a gap between the head and the helmet leading to an increase in surface pressures beneath the focused regions. In the second part of this dissertation, the response of post-mortem human specimen (PMHS) heads is studied. Three PMHS heads are subjected to primary blast of varying peak incident intensities or overpressures (70 kPa, 140 kPa and 200 kPa). When the incident blast intensity is increased, there is a statistically significant increase in the peak intracranial pressure (ICP) and total impulse (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Further, for blast overpressures of 140 kPa and 200 kPa, ICP values exceed brain <b>injury</b> <b>thresholds</b> available in the literature based on blunt impacts. From the parametric studies on the validated human head model, it is seen that the wave propagation through skin-skull-brain parenchyma plays prominent role in governing ICP-time histories. The effect of helmets on PMHS head is also analyzed. The results suggest that based only on ICP blast mitigation offered by the current helmets may be marginal, if at all.

The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the risk of skin abrasions from the airbag fabric seam design by using a new shear testing methodology. High-rate shear loading was performed with a pneumatic impactor that propelled a section of airbag fabric across porcine skin at 85 m/s. Twenty-seven tests (three control and 24 with fabric) were performed using eight different seam designs. A 40 cm 3 10 cm section of airbag fabric with each seam was forced across a 5 cm 3 5 cm section of fresh porcine skin that was acquired within 2 h post-mortem. No abrasions were observed in the three control tests, but abrasions were observed in all 24 of the tests conducted using airbag fabric. The unturned, sewn seam orientation resulted in significantly more severe abrasions than the woven, unturned seam orientation (P = 0. 01).

Instruction with respect to lifting technique is commonly employed to prevent low back pain. The squat technique is the most widely advised lifting technique. Intervention studies failed to show health eects of this approach and consequently the rationale behind the advised lifting techniques has been questioned. Methods. Biomechanical studies comparing the stoop and squat technique were systematically reviewed. The dependent variables used in these studies and the methods by which these were measured or estimated were ranked for validity as indicators of low back load. Results. Spinal compression as indicated by intra-discal pressure and spinal shrinkage appeared not significantly dierent be-tween both lifting techniques. Net moments and compression forces based on model estimates were found to be equal or somewhat higher in squat than in stoop lifting. Only when the load could be lifted from a position in between the feet did squat lifting cause lower net moments, although the studies reporting this finding had a marginal validity. Shear force and bending moments acting on the spine appeared lower in squat lifting.

The objective of this dissertation was to quantify the age-dependent material properties {{of the human brain}} and skull and to determine their effect on the biomechanical response of the head to traumatic loading. Mechanical testing was performed on infant and adult porcine brain tissue and infant and adult porcine and infant human skull to define the age-related mechanical properties of these tissues. Brain tissue was tested in dynamic oscillatory simple shear from 20 - 200 Hz to determine its complex shear modulus. Skull tissue was tested in three-point bending and tension to failure at a quasi-static rate (2. 54 mm/min) and a dynamic rate (2540 mm/min) to determine the age-dependent and loading rate-dependent properties of cranial bone and suture. Finite element models of the infant and adult brain and braincase were developed to investigate the age-dependent nature of intracranial strain distribution during impact loading. ^ The elastic and viscous components of the complex shear modulus of the brain changed significantly with the development of the cerebrum. These changes in material properties correlated with increases in brain mass, total cell number, and myelin, and a decrease in water content. The elastic modulus, ultimate stress, and energy absorbed to failure of cranial bone increased, and the ultimate strain decreased with age. Likewise, the elastic modulus, ultimate stress, and energy absorbed to failure increased with age for sutures. These factors predispose the head of the newborn to large, potentially injurious shape changes during traumatic loading as demonstrated in a parametric study of impact loading performed with the finite element models. In the finite element simulations of impact loading of the head, the intracranial strains within the infant brain were diffusely distributed throughout the brain while the intracranial strains within the brain of the adult model were focused under the impact site. These investigations are essential for predicting the unique mechanical response of the pediatric skull to traumatic loads associated with head injury and, thus, for defining head <b>injury</b> <b>thresholds</b> for children. ...|$|R
