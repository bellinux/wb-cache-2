500|$|To move <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> unified design, Valve {{sought a}} game designer, but found no one {{suitable}} for the job. Instead, Valve decided to create the [...] "cabal", initially a group of six individuals from across all departments that worked primarily for six months straight in six-hour meetings four days a week. The cabal was responsible for all elements of design, including level layouts, key events, enemy designs, narrative, {{and the introduction of}} new gameplay elements relative to the story. The collaboration proved successful, and once the cabal had come to decisions on types of gameplay elements that would be needed, mini-cabals formed from other departments most affected by the choice were formed to implement these elements. Membership in the main cabal rotated, since commitment required created burnout. The cabal produced a 200-page design document detailing nearly every aspect of the game. They also produced a 30-page document for the game's narrative, and hired a writer, novelist Marc Laidlaw, to help manage that script for the game to assure in-game consistency. The soundtrack was composed by Kelly Bailey.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} 2009 reboot's {{theatrical}} release, producers Brad Fuller and Andrew Form {{expressed an interest}} in producing another Friday the 13th film, citing the enjoyment they had working on the reboot. On October 1, 2009, Warner Bros. Pictures announced that it planned to release the Friday the 13th sequel on August 13, 2010. Subsequently, on December 10, 2009, Warner Bros. announced that it had pulled the sequel from the August 13, 2010 release slot and listed its release as [...] "TBD" [...] (to be determined). Warner Bros. also announced that Damian Shannon and Mark Swift were penning the sequel. On April 21, 2010, Fuller announced on his Twitter page that a sequel to the 2009 remake was no longer in the works, declaring it, [...] "dead — not happening". [...] In a later interview, Fuller explained that the 2009 reboot {{was the result of a}} joint effort between Paramount and New Line Cinema, as both owned portions of the Friday the 13th franchise. With a down economy, both studios were limiting the films they produced each year, opting to produce films carrying lower risks and higher rewards. Accordingly, the companies put Friday the 13th Part 2 on hold in hopes that they would move <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> next installment when the economy bounced back. Form explained that neither studio would walk away from the sequel's production to allow the other to move forward as the primary producing house, each studio concerned that its players would look like [...] "idiots" [...] should the sequel perform well without its involvement. Form and Fuller also mentioned that the Friday the 13th sequel may be a 3‑D film, should it ever again be green-lit for production by the studios.|$|E

6000|$|At a Thing {{of all the}} Fylkes of Trondhjem, Thing held at Froste in that region, King Hakon, {{with all}} the eloquence he had, {{signified}} that it was imperatively necessary that all Bonders and sub-Bonders should become Christians, and believe in one God, Christ the Son of Mary; renouncing entirely blood sacrifices and heathen idols; should keep every seventh day holy, abstain from labor that day, and even from food, devoting the day to fasting and sacred meditation. Whereupon, by way of universal answer, arose a confused universal murmur of entire dissent. [...] "Take away from us our old belief, and also our time for labor!" [...] murmured they in angry astonishment; [...] "how can even the land be got tilled in that way?" [...] "We cannot work if we don't get food," [...] said the hand laborers and slaves. [...] "It lies in King Hakon's blood," [...] remarked others; [...] "his father and all his kindred were apt to be stingy about food, though liberal enough with money." [...] At length, one Osbjorn (or Bear of the Asen or Gods, {{what we now call}} Osborne), one Osbjorn of Medalhusin Gulathal, stept forward, and said, in a distinct manner, [...] "We Bonders (peasant proprietors) thought, King Hakon, when thou heldest thy first Thing-day here in Trondhjem, and we took thee for our king, and received our hereditary lands from thee again that we had got heaven itself. But now we know not how it is, whether we have won freedom, or whether thou intendest anew to make us slaves, with this wonderful proposal that we should renounce our faith, which our fathers before us have held, and all our ancestors as well, first in the age of burial by burning, and now in that of earth burial; and yet these departed ones were much our superiors, and their faith, too, has brought prosperity to us. Thee, at the same time, we have loved so much that we raised thee to manage all the laws of the land, and speak as their voice to us all. And even now it is our will and the vote of all Bonders to keep that paction which thou gavest us here on the Thing at Froste, and to maintain thee as king so long as any of us Bonders who are here upon the Thing has life left, provided thou, king, wilt go fairly to work, and demand of us only such things as are not impossible. But if thou wilt fix upon this thing with so great obstinacy, and employ force and power, in that case, we Bonders have taken the resolution, all of us, to fall away from thee, and to take for ourselves another head, who will so behave that we may enjoy in freedom the belief which is agreeable to us. Now shalt thou, king, choose one of these two courses before the Thing disperse." [...] "Whereupon," [...] adds the Chronicle, [...] "all the Bonders raised a mighty shout, 'Yes, we will have it so, as has been said.'" [...] So that Jarl Sigurd had to intervene, and King Hakon to choose for the moment the milder branch of the alternative. [4] At other Things Hakon was more or less successful. All his days, by such methods as there were, he kept pressing <b>forward</b> <b>with</b> <b>this</b> great enterprise; and on the whole did thoroughly shake asunder the old edifice of heathendom, and fairly introduce some foundation for the new and better rule of faith and life among his people.

40|$|The goal of Opportunistic Networks (OppNets) is {{to enable}} message {{transmission}} in an infrastructure less environment where a reliable end-to-end {{connection between the}} hosts in not possible at all times. The role of OppNets is very crucial in today’s communication as {{it is still not}} possible to build a communication infrastructure in some geographical areas including mountains, oceans and other remote areas. Nodes participating in the message forwarding process in OppNets experience frequent disconnections. The employment of an appropriate routing protocol to achieve successful message delivery is one of the desirable requirements of OppNets. Routing challenges are very complex and evident in OppNets due to the dynamic nature and the topology of the intermittent networks. This adds more complexity in the choice of the suitable protocol to be employed in opportunistic scenarios, to enable message <b>forwarding.</b> <b>With</b> <b>this</b> in mind, the aim {{of this paper is to}} analyze a number of algorithms under each class of routing techniques that support message forwarding in OppNets and to compare those studied algorithms in terms of their performances, forwarding techniques, outcomes and success rates.

However, traditional 2 D compositing implementations are not capable of 3 D models compositing tasks. In order to composite 3 D graphics on embedded platform, the 3 D compositing implementation is necessary.
