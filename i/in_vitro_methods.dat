25|$|Most {{techniques}} {{used to study}} protein–protein interactions rely on <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>methods.</b> Unfortunately, studying proteins in an artificial system, outside of their cellular environment, poses a number of difficulties. For example, this may require the removal of proteins from their normal cellular environment. The processing required to isolate the protein may affect its interactions with other proteins. In addition, isolating the protein from the intracellular signaling and mechanisms {{that occur in the}} normal cell may provide a misleading picture of intracellular and physiological occurrences. Furthermore, proteins studied in vitro may be studied at concentrations vastly different from their normal abundance levels, may not necessarily be transported efficiently into the cells, or may not be selective enough to function in the host genome. Finally, by studying proteins in vitro, one is unable to determine the influence of specific protein–protein interactions in the cell on the functional or physiological consequences.|$|E
40|$|In the sublingual (SL) cavity, {{compared}} with the gastrointestinal tract, tablets are subjected to minimal physiological agitation, and a limited volume of saliva is available to facilitate disintegration and dissolution. None of the official compendial dissolution apparatuses and methods simulate these SL conditions. In this study, a custom-made dissolution apparatus was constructed, and a novel <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>method</b> that simulates SL conditions was evaluated. Several epinephrine 40  mg SL tablet formulations under development and two commercial SL tablets, isosorbide dinitrate 5  mg and nitroglycerin 0. 6  mg, were studied. The dissolution medium was 2  mL of distilled water at 25 °C. Dissolution was measured at 60 and 120  s.

40|$|Attempts {{to devise}} an {{antimicrobial}} approach to combating dentomicrobial infections such as periodontal diseases {{continue to be}} hampered {{by the lack of}} a relevant <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>method</b> for determining the susceptibility of suspected periodontopathogens to topically applied antimicrobial agents. Proposed here is a novel <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>method</b> called the membrane transfer technique, which acknowledges those aspects unique to localized pathogenic infections, particularly those associated with anaerobic bacteria. Bacterial lawns representing six suspected periodontopathic bacteria were prepared on membranes and then placed in contact with different concentrations of antimicrobial agents for 5 min. After incubation for 12 to 24 h, MBCs were determined {{with the aid of a}} tetrazolium chloride indicator. Four antimicrobial agents (chlorhexidine, iodine, stannous fluoride, and sodium fluoride) were used to test the applicability of the proposed <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>method.</b> MBCs were derived for each agent except sodium fluoride against all or most of the six bacterial strains tested.

25|$|Doubled haploids can be {{produced}} in vivo or in vitro. Haploid embryos are produced in vivo by parthenogenesis, pseudogamy, or chromosome elimination after wide crossing. The haploid embryo is rescued, cultured, and chromosome-doubling produces doubled haploids. The <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>methods</b> include gynogenesis (ovary and flower culture) and androgenesis (anther and microspore culture). Androgenesis is the preferred method. Another method of producing the haploids is wide crossing. In barley, haploids can {{be produced}} by wide crossing with the related species Hordeum bulbosum; fertilization is affected, but {{during the early stages}} of seed development the H. bulbosum chromosomes are eliminated leaving a haploid embryo. In tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), wide crossing with Nicotiana africana is widely used. When N. africana is used to pollinate N. tabacum, 0.25 to 1.42 percent of the progeny survive and can readily be identified as either F1 hybrids or maternal haploids. Although these percentages appear small, the vast yield of tiny seeds and the early death of most seedlings provide significant numbers of viable hybrids and haploids in relatively small soil containers. This method of interspecific pollination serves as a practical way of producing seed-derived haploids of N. tabacum, either as an alternative method or complementary method to anther culture.|$|E

40|$|An <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>method</b> for the {{estimation}} of iron bioavailability was subjected to an interlaboratory trial. The method involved a simulated gastrointestinal digestion using pepsin for the gastric stage followed by pancreatin and bile salts for the intestinal stage. The proportion of iron diffused through a semipermeable membrane (molecular mass cut-off 10 kDa) {{was used to measure}} the iron dialysability. An interlaboratory trial between nine laboratories was conducted to evaluate the repeatability and reproducibility of the agreed method. The reproducibility of the method among the participating laboratories was 20 - 30 % and depended on the content of dialysable iron. Several factors contributing to the variation <b>in</b> the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> dialysability among laboratories are discussed. The pH adjustment in the intestinal digestion was identified as one of the critical parameters. The present <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>method</b> was used to evaluate the iron dialysability from three meals. The dialysability data were in reasonable agreement with human absorption data.

40|$|After giving blood depletion, phenylhydrazine, {{hydrochloric}} acid hydroxylamine, carbon tetrachloride, and carbon black to rabbits the author estimated {{the number of}} Heinz bodies in the circulating blood of each animal {{and the number of}} Heinz bodies appearing <b>in</b> the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> accelerating test, and studied {{the relationship between the two}} appearances. 1. In the circulating blood of normal rabbits no Heinz body can be recognized. By the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> accelerating <b>method</b> erythrocytes containing Heinz bodies amount ot 66. 7 per cent. 2. In the circulating blood of the rabbits depleted of blood once in a small or a large amount, or successively depleted of blood in an intermediate amount no Heinz body can be found. the circulating blood of the rabbits depleted of its blood once in a large amount a few Heinz bodies can be detected. By the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>method</b> Heinz bodies appear in an inverse proportion to the number of erythrocytes, but there seems to be no relation with the number of Heinz bodies in the circulating blood. 3. When phenylhydrazine is injected, Heinz bodies appear in the circulating blood in various forms according to the dose of the injection. However, by the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>method</b> the greater majority of Heinz bodies appeared in the circulating blood are destroyed, and many Heinz bodies observable in this instance are the ones produced anew <b>in</b> <b>vitro.</b> 4. <b>In</b> the case injected with {{hydrochloric acid}} hydrocylamine, Heinz bodies appearing in the circulating blood are more distinct and erythrocytes themselves are more brilliant than those in the case injected with phenylhydrazine. Even by the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> accelerating <b>method</b> Heinz bodies appeared in the circulating biood are destroyed in a lesser number than in the case of the phenylhydrazine injection. 5. In the rabbits administered with carbon tetrachloride Heinz bodies can be recognized in the circualting blood soon after the injection but they are a few in number and small in size. By the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>method</b> the blood taken from 10 to 12 days after the injection an intermediate number of Heinz bodies are formed. 6. In the case injected repeatedly with carbon black Heinz bodies appear in the circulating blood 2 to 4 days after the initiation of the injection, and by the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> accelerating <b>method</b> Heinz bodies increase as long as the injection is kept up, but they decrease in number at the cessation of the injection. It seems that the function of the reticuloendothelial system is responsible for the formation of Heinz bodies in the circulating blood while the carbon black injection itself is greatly responsible for the appearance of Heinz bodies by the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> <b>method.</b> From these, the Heinz body in the circulating blood has the characteristic traits that are different from those of the Heinz body appearing <b>in</b> the <b>in</b> <b>vitro</b> accelerating <b>method.</b> Therefore even the latter is present in vivo in a preparatory state, it is believed that the latter will not immediately be transformed into the in vivo Heinz body...|$|R
