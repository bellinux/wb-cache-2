500|$|GameSpy {{reviewer}} Phil Theobald, who {{awarded the}} games {{four out of}} five stars, stated, [...] "Before I knew it, I was hooked all over again. The engrossingly simple gameplay combined with the more-strategic-than-they-first-appear battles was just too much to resist. And yeah, the 'gotta catch 'em all' gimmick is still effective, not to mention necessary to build a well balanced party. There's <b>just</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> tracking down, capturing, and training all those Pokémon that really draw you into the game's world." [...] He justified the games' graphics by comparing them to the [...] "ugly" [...] original Red and Blue versions. Additional praise was given to the new features such as the contextual tutorial, and flashbacks when loading a saved game, as well as the games' multiplayer capabilities via the Wireless adapter.|$|E

Tony Iommi is the king of the heavy riff." [...] former Guns N' Roses guitarist Slash said of the Paranoid album: [...] "There's <b>just</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> that whole record that, when you're a kid and you're turned onto it, it's like a whole different world. It just opens up your mind to another dimension...Paranoid is the whole Sabbath experience; very indicative of what Sabbath meant at the time. Tony's playing style—doesn't matter whether it's off Paranoid or if it's off Heaven and Hell—it's very distinctive." [...] Anthrax guitarist Scott Ian said [...] "I always get the question in every interview I do, 'What are your top five metal albums?' I make it easy for myself and always say the first five Sabbath albums." ...|$|E

He found that [...] "there is <b>just</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the cold and numb Itachi," [...] that makes the viewer [...] "want to breakout in chills".

NTT customers voted him as their tenth favorite black haired male anime character. CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama referred to Itachi as one of his favorite characters from Naruto.|$|E

Mane stated that {{it was very difficult to}} act only with his eyes. Scout Taylor-Compton endured a long audition process, but as director Zombie explains, [...] "Scout was my first choice. There was <b>just</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> her; she had a genuine quality. She didn't seem actor-y." [...] She was one of the final people to be cast for a lead role after Faerch, Mane, McDowell, Forsythe, and Harris. A contest was held for a walk-on role in the film, at the time called Halloween 9; it was won by Heather Bowen. She played a news reporter who covered Michael's arrest, but her scene was cut from the film and does not appear in the deleted scenes.|$|E

[...] The studio in the Frederick Douglass Academy is where most of Charles Hamilton's music is made.

60|$|On his {{way back}} along the Broom Road, under the lighted lamps that marked the {{entrance}} to the palace grounds, Grief encountered a short, rotund gentleman, in unstarched ducks, smooth-shaven and of florid complexion, who was <b>just</b> emerging. <b>Something</b> <b>about</b> his tentative, saturated gait was familiar. Grief knew it on the instant. On the beaches of a dozen South Sea ports had he seen it before.|$|R
2500|$|Along this theme, PBS {{commentator}} Bill Moyers {{noted that}} MSNBC commentator Tucker Carlson had said of Clinton, [...] "There's <b>just</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> her that feels castrating, overbearing, and scary," [...] and that top-rated {{radio talk show}} host Rush Limbaugh continued to refer to her as [...] "the woman with the testicle lockbox."

[...] Further discussion ensued when the Drudge Report and a few other media outlets ran an unflattering Associated Press photograph of Clinton looking old and tired on the wintry Iowa campaign trail; Limbaugh sympathized with the plight of American women in an appearance-obsessed culture, then asked, [...] "Will this country want to actually watch a woman get older before their eyes on a daily basis?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Eurogamer's Tom Bramwell {{scored the}} PlayStation 2 version 7 out of 10, writing [...] "although {{comparisons}} with GTA III and its multi-million-selling sequel are inevitable, True Crime actually {{does a good}} job of setting out its own stall." [...] He was critical of the graphics, citing [...] "low-resolution textures, some clipping issues, a rather horrible depth of field effect and a lack of screen-filling vistas." [...] He called Nicholas Kang [...] "one of the most unlikeable folks I've ever had the displeasure of thumbing around a third-person action game". However, he also wrote [...] "The fact is that there's just something compelling about the game - and it's not any particular element over another - it's <b>just</b> <b>something</b> <b>about</b> the cohesiveness of the whole thing." [...] He concluded [...] "True Crime is this year's The Getaway - it's not GTA and it will frustrate for some on that basis, but it's a respectable enough game in its own right." ...|$|E
2500|$|Basil {{was first}} modeled on Bing Crosby, but the animators {{eventually}} took inspiration from Leslie Howard. Initially, Ratigan {{had been designed}} as thin, weasely, and ratlike. Following the screening of Champagne for Caesar, Glen Keane noted that following the casting of Price, [...] "is expressive voice and attitude inspired us to further redesign the character." [...] Additionally, during one story meeting, Glen Keane decided to base the stature of Ratigan on then-Disney CEO Ron Miller, who was a 6'6" [...] former football player for the Los Angeles Rams.

5000|$|Come Morning {{was shot}} over 12 days in mid October 2011. Filming took place {{just outside the}} small town of Kingsland, Arkansas, the boyhood home of director, Derrick Sims. Sims chose 1970s Kingsland, because he said “It captures the {{atmosphere}} and the hunting culture of southern Arkansas.” When asked why he set the film in 1973, Sims said hunting was different back then. [...] "I didn't want the characters to bait the deer or have motion cameras to photograph them. I also didn't want them to have cellphones.

5000|$|Disney {{has done}} some new {{projects}} with Oswald since recovering him. He's co-starred with Mickey in a video game series vaguely, Lord of the Rings crossed with Who Framed Roger Rabbit, called Epic Mickey. Kids who have discovered those games have discovered the Oswald films, and it's fascinating to see that Oswald is a genuinely popular character with kids today. If you ask a high schooler if they know Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, a surprising number will say yes. And so essentially there is <b>just</b> <b>something</b> vital <b>about</b> these characters that, when presented the right way, would absolutely connect with all ages.|$|R

5000|$|Following {{a widely}} publicized premiere party at Flipper's roller disco in West Hollywood on October 1, 1979 and {{billed as the}} Rock and Roller Disco Movie of the Year, {{by the time of}} its release roller disco was a fast-waning fad and the {{popularity}} of disco music had peaked (Disco Demolition Night had already happened {{two and a half months}} earlier). Aside from some praise for Swayze's skating and screen presence the movie was neither a critical nor a box office success. However, by the early 21st century a writer for oddculture.com called the film [...] "a true cult item and one of the best 70s time capsules around. ...
