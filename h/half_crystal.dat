40|$|Proceeding of: 1998 IEEE Nuclear Science Symposium and Medical Imaging Conference, Toronto, Ont., 08 - 14 Nov. 1998 Detector modules {{in small}} ring {{diameter}} PET scanners must possess depth-of-interaction (DOI) encoding, increased spatial sampling, high sensitivity {{and the ability}} to handle high photon input rates without excessive pulse pileup or random coincidences. We created such a module by optically coupling an entrance array of individual LGSO crystals to an exit array of individual GSO (and other) crystals that was, in turn, optically and directly coupled to a miniature PSPMT. DO 1 was determined for each event by delayed charge integration (DCI), a technique that exploits differences in light decay time between GSO and LGSO. Spatial sampling in 3 D was increased by introducing a <b>half</b> <b>crystal</b> pitch spatial offset between the entrance and exit arrays in both the X and Y directions. Position detection accuracy in both the LGSO and GSO layers, and the accuracy of DO 1 assignment of events to either layer was high.

40|$|Adaptation to any {{undesirable}} {{change in}} the environment dictates the survivability of many microorganisms. Such changes generate a quick and suitable response, which guides the physiology of bacteria. Stringent response {{is one of the}} mechanisms that can be called a survival strategy under nutritional starvation in bacteria and was first observed in E. coli upon amino acid starvation, when bacteria demonstrated an immediate downshift in the rRNA and tRNA levels (Stent and Brenner 1961). Mutations that rendered bacteria insensitive to amino acid levels were mapped to an ‘RC gene locus’, later termed relA because of the relAxed behavior of the bacteria (Alfoldi et al. 1962). Later on, Cashel and Gallant, showed that two “magic spots” (MSI and MSII) were specifically observed in starved cells when a labeled nucleotide extract of these cells was separated by thin layer chromatography (Cashel and Gallant 1969). These molecules were found to be polyphosphate derivatives of guanosine, ppGpp and pppGpp (Cashel and Kalbacher 1970; Sy and Lipmann 1973), and were shown to be involved in regulating the gene expression in the bacterial cell, demonstrating a global response, thus fine-tuning the physiology of the bacterium. Two proteins in E. coli, RelA and SpoT, carry out the synthesis and hydrolysis of these molecules, respectively, and maintain their levels in the cell (Cashel et al. 1996; Chatterji and Ojha 2001). On the other hand, Gram-positive organisms have only one protein Rel carrying out the functions of both RelA and SpoT (Mechold et al. 1996; Martinez-Costa et al. 1998; Avarbock et al. 1999). Although Rel or RelA/SpoT has been studied from several systems in detail pertaining to the physiological adaptation, less information is available on the egulation of the protein activity under different conditions. Our studies show that the RelMsm is composed of several domains (HD, RSD, TGS and ACT) with distinct function. HD and RSD domains, present in the N-terminal half of the protein, harbor catalytic sites for the hydrolysis and the synthesis of (p) ppGpp, respectively. TGS and ACT domains, on the other hand, are present at the C-erminal half of the protein and have regulatory function. It, therefore, appears that a communication exists between these domains, to regulate protein activity. It was shown earlier, while studying Rel from S. equisimilis, that there exists an interaction between the C-terminal and the N- terminal of the protein which determines the kind of activity (synthesis/hydrolysis), the protein should demonstrate (Mechold et al. 2002). Later, the N-terminal <b>half</b> <b>crystal</b> structure of the same protein suggested an inter-domain “cross-talk” between the HD and the RSD domain that controls the synthesis/hydrolysis switch depending on cellular conditions (Hogg et al. 2004). In the present work, studies have been carried out to understand a Gram- positive Rel in greater detail and to find out how the opposing activities of Rel are regulated so that a futile cycle of synthesis and hydrolysis of (p) ppGpp, at the expense of ATP, can be avoided. The work has been divided into several chapters describing studies on various aspects of the protein. Chapter 1 outlines the history of the stringent response and summarizes the information available about the stringent response in various systems including plants. Several roles that (p) ppGpp plays in different bacteria have been examined. A special mention on the crystal structure of RelSeq has been made with respect to the regulation of activity. Also, the information available regarding the effects of (p) ppGpp on RNA polymerase has been documented. Role of ppGpp in plants has been discussed in great detail with special emphasis on abiotic stresses. Since different functional domains have been identified in RelMsm, the protein has been divided into two halves and they have been discussed separately in the form of two chapters. Chapter 2 describes the N-terminal half of the Rel protein of M. smegmatis in greater detail. Out of the several domains identified, the role of the two domains present in the N-terminal half of the protein has been studied. The N-terminal half shows both synthesis and hydrolysis activities. Importantly, we find that the protein is active {{even in the absence of}} accessory factors such as ribosome and uncharged tRNA, unlike RelA of E. coli. Moreover, deletion of the C-terminal half of the protein leads to a much higher synthetic activity, clearly indicating that the C-terminus is involved in regulating the activity of the protein. Both TGS and ACT domains (the two domains found in the C-terminal half of the protein) have been found to play a regulatory role. The results also indicate that all the deleted constructs are active both in vitro and in vivo. Chapter 3 	discusses the C-terminal half of the protein and its role in the multimerization observed in RelMsm. We show that multimerization of Rel protein is due to the inter-molecular disulfide cross-linking. Furthermore, we find that the monomer is the active species in vivo. One of the fascinating points about the C- terminal half is that it is largely unstructured. Additionally, the C-terminal half cannot complement the N-terminal part of the protein when provided in trans, demonstrating further, the requirement of an intact protein for bringing about regulation of Rel activity. This requirement in	cis suggests the presence of an intra-molecular communication between the N- and the C-termini, as a mediator of protein regulation. Further, presence of uncharged tRNA increases pppGpp synthesis and down-regulates its hydrolysis in the wildtype protein. However, the uncharged tRNA-mediated regulation is absent in the deleted construct with only the N-terminus half, indicating that uncharged tRNA binds to the C-terminal half of the protein. Several cysteine mutants have been constructed to understand their role in the regulation of Rel activity. The results suggest that one cysteine, present at the C-terminus, is required for intra-molecular cross-talk and the uncharged tRNA-mediated regulation. A detailed characterization of the communication between the two halves of the protein has been attempted in Chapter 4. Surface plasmon resonance experiments carried out on the different cysteine mutants discussed in Chapter 3, for uncharged tRNA binding indicate that all the mutants bind to uncharged tRNA with near-equal affinities as the wildtype protein. This study suggests that the non-responsiveness for tRNA seen in one of the cysteine mutants is due to the loss of inter-domain interaction, while the binding of protein to accessory factors is unaffected. Fluorescence resonance energy transfer has been carried out to observe domain movement in the presence of accessory factors. Distances between the different domains scattered in this ~ 90 kDa protein, measured by FRET technique, are suggestive of an inter-domain cross-talk, specifically between C 338 and C 692, thereby regulating the activity of this enzyme. We show, for the first time, that the product of this protein, (p) ppGpp can bind to the C-terminal half making it unstructured, and can, therefore, regulate the protein activity. Chapter 5 is an effort to characterize the promoter of rel from M. tuberculosis. This study was undertaken in order to develop an expression system in mycobacteria. The + 1 transcription and the translation start sites have been identified. The – 10 hexamer for the RNA polymerase binding has also been mapped using site-directed mutagenesis and is found to be TATCCT. This promoter is also unusually close to the + 1 transcription start site. The promoter is specific for mycobacteria and does not function in	E. coli. Additionally, the promoter is found to be constitutive in	M. smegmatis; however, the possibility of it being regulated in M. tuberculosis cannot be ruled out. Appendix	section discusses, in short, the phylogenetic analysis of the mycobacterial Rel sequences. Diagrams of the plasmids used in this study have been provided.

Both local electronic structures and optical properties revealed gradients within the grain boundary cores of both investigated interfaces. The {{results show that}} even in the presence of atomically structured grain boundary cores with widths of less than 1 nm, optical properties have to be represented with gradual changes across the grain boundary structures to quantitatively reproduce accurate van der Waals–London dispersion interactions.

When one bond is broken, the rearrangement of the electronic charge for these metals does not practically lead to a change of the remaining bonds. Thus the energy needed to break a bond is independent of the surface orientation, so that the surface energy is in good approximation proportional to the number of broken nearest-neighbour bonds. The surface energy represents a fundamental material property. It is given by half the energy needed to cut a given <b>crystal</b> into two <b>half</b> <b>crystals.</b> As such the surface energy naturally depends on the strength of the bonding and on the orientation of the surface plane.

40|$|In {{taking a}} {{different}} view of crystallization dynamics, this thesis reveals a new framework for addressing a prevalent process engineering challenge: control over the size of crystals produced by batch cooling crystallization. The thesis divides roughly into halves. In the first <b>half,</b> the <b>crystal</b> size control problem is introduced and the proposed framework for addressing this problem—termed the mass-count (MC) framework—is developed. This new framework is laid out along side the population balance (PB) framework, which is the prevailing framework for modeling crystallization dynamics and addressing the crystal size control problem. In putting the proposed and established frameworks side by side, the intent {{is not to say that}} one or the other is correct. Rather, the point is to show that they are different perspectives that facilitate different control approaches. The PB framework is built up from first principles; it is intellectually stimulating and mathematically complete, but it has a drawback for application: it does not directly enable feedback control. The MC framework, on the other hand, takes a less detailed view of crystallization dynamics and does not connect to crystallization theory as directly; it is also more conducive to application.

The framework is first applied to understand and model the crystallization dynamics for two widely different systems: darapskite salt crystallization from water and paracetamol crystallization from ethanol. Once the dynamics have been modeled, the framework is then used to develop feedback control schemes. These schemes are applied to both experimental systems and, in both cases, crystal size control is demonstrated. Ph. D...|$|R

His final game for the club {{turned out to be a}} 2-0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers on 3 November 1998, when he was stretchered off in the last few minutes.|$|R
40|$|The crystallographic {{quality of}} protein {{crystals}} that were grown in microgravity {{has been compared}} to that of crystals that were grown in parallel on earth gravity under otherwise identical conditions. A goal of this comparison was to assess if a more accurate 3 D-structure can be derived from crystallographic analysis of the former crystals. Therefore, the properties of crystals prepared with the Advanced Protein Crystallisation Facility (APCF) on earth and in orbit during the last decade were evaluated. A statistical analysis reveals that about <b>half</b> of the <b>crystals</b> produced under microgravity had a superior X-ray diffraction limit with respect of terrestrial controls. Eleven protein structures could be determined at previously unachieved resolutions using crystals obtained in the APCF. Microgravity induced features of the most relevant structures are reported. A second goal {{of this study was to}} identify the cause of the crystal quality enhancement useful for structure determination. No correlations between the effect of microgravity and other system-dependent parameters, such as isoelectric point or crystal solvent content, were found except the reduced convection during the crystallisation process. Thus, crystal growth under diffusive regime appears to be the key parameter explaining the beneficial effect of microgravity on crystal quality. The mimicry of these effects on earth in gels or in capillary tubes is discussed and the practical consequences for structural biology highlighted...|$|R
40|$|Microscopists {{have done}} {{combined}} space and frequency decompositions optically since long before coining {{of the word}} “wavelet ” [1], under the name “darkfield imaging ” [2]. Now integrative views of lattice information in digital images yield new challenges for mathematical harmonic analysis [3]. Such challenges are illustrated {{by a series of}} notes [4 - 7] on the uses and shortcomings of “weakly convergent ” Fourier transform window techniques. Here, we show how robust (if pedestrian) digital darkfield techniques help to characterize: (i) an Antimony-doped Tin Oxide nanoparticle screw dislocation, and (ii) twinning and strain in a gold decahedral twin. Each row in the figures at right contains a power spectrum used to select a reference “g-vector ” of interest, followed by a complex-color map of darkfield amplitude (intensity) and phase (hue) with respect to that g-vector. The remaining two columns use coordinate-color to show isotropic strain (red is compressed, cyan is expanded) and shear strain (chartreuse is clockwise and indigo is counter clockwise) with respect to that reference. Each pixel in these is a fractional strain measurement. The (110) planes in the ATO grain of Fig. 1 (top row) show a 180 degree phase-lag between the top and bottom <b>half</b> of the <b>crystal</b> in the darkfield, in spite of the spacing uniformity (seen in both the phase beats of the complex darkfield image, and comparable top/bottom intensities in the strai...|$|R
