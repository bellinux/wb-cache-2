She stood before us, seemingly slight, graceful of carriage, and exquisitely beautiful even to critical eyes. Then, still standing, she faced her class {{as one who}} knew herself {{to be a teacher}} by divine right. She turned to the student {{at the end of the}} first row of seats and took direct mental cognizance of this one, plainly knocked at the door of this individual consciousness.... This continued until each member of the class had received the same mental cognizance. No audible word voiced the purely mental contact.|$|E
5|$|During this period, Monroe {{gained a}} {{reputation}} for being difficult on film sets; the difficulties worsened as her career progressed. She was often late or did not show up at all, did not remember her lines, and would demand several re-takes before she was satisfied with her performance. Monroe's dependence on her acting coaches—first Natasha Lytess and later Paula Strasberg—also irritated directors. Monroe's problems have been attributed to a combination of perfectionism, low self-esteem, and stage fright; she disliked the lack of control she <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> work on film sets, and never experienced similar problems during photo shoots, in which she had more say over her performance and could be more spontaneous instead of following a script. To alleviate her anxiety and chronic insomnia, she began to use barbiturates, amphetamines and alcohol, which also exacerbated her problems, although she did not become severely addicted until 1956. According to Sarah Churchwell, some of Monroe's behavior especially later in her career was also in response to the condescension and sexism of her male co-stars and directors. Similarly, Lois Banner has stated that she was bullied by many of her directors.|$|E

25|$|The {{illustrations}} for {{the opening}} verse about Appley Dapply, for example, date from 1891 and reveal an artist with an original vision, technical mastery, and a near obsession with almost photographic realism, but the looser, more fluid illustration for the sixth rhyme about gravy and potatoes (recycled from The Tale of Pigling Bland of 1913) is less concerned with straight lines, microscopic detail, and photographic realism. The latter illustration displays Potter's development and maturity {{as an artist and}} the effect her failing eyesight <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> style.|$|E

Her stalker, Alex Gray, who had sent an email to his mother stating he was planning on murdering a celebrity, spent nights in her back garden, broke into her bedroom whilst she was sleeping and ultimately forced Allen to move. She has strongly criticised the Metropolitan Police for their inaction in the case, which included refusals to show Allen {{a picture of her}} stalker, lending her a panic alarm before demanding it back and refusal to believe stalking incidents were linked.|$|E

500|$|Madonna's Italian-Catholic {{background}} and {{her relationship with}} her parents are reflected in the album Like a Prayer. It was an evocation of the impact religion <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> career. Her video for the title track contains Catholic symbolism, such as the stigmata. During The Virgin Tour, she wore a rosary and prayed with it in the music video for [...] "La Isla Bonita". The [...] "Open Your Heart" [...] video sees her boss scolding her in the Italian language. On the Who's That Girl World Tour, she dedicated the song [...] "Papa Don't Preach" [...] to Pope John Paul II. Her album MDNA (2012) has also drawn many influences from her Catholic upbringing, and since 2011 she has been attending meetings and services at an Opus Dei center, a Catholic institution that encourages spirituality through every day life.|$|E

500|$|The two poets had met {{three years}} earlier in either late August or September 1795 in Bristol. The meeting laid the {{foundation}} for an intense and profoundly creative friendship, based in part on their shared disdain for the artificial diction of the poetry of the era. Beginning in 1797, the two lived within walking distance of each other in Somerset, which solidified their friendship. Wordsworth believed that his life before meeting Coleridge was sedentary and dull, and that his poetry amounted to little. Coleridge influenced Wordsworth, and his praise and encouragement inspired Wordsworth to write prolifically. Dorothy, Wordsworth's sister, related the effect Coleridge <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> brother in a March 1798 letter: [...] "His faculties seem to expand every day, he composes with much more facility than he did, as to the mechanism [...] of poetry, and his ideas flow faster than he can express them." [...] With his new inspiration, Wordsworth came to believe he could write poetry rivalling that of John Milton. He and Coleridge planned to collaborate, but never moved beyond suggestions and notes for each other.|$|E
500|$|By December 2011, Romney assumed an {{even more}} {{prominent}} role in the campaign, {{as she tried to}} offer a more rounded and compelling portrait of her husband while he fell behind Newt Gingrich for a stretch in polls. [...] Her emphasis on their 42years of marriage and his steadfastness following the onset of her disease offered an implicit but clear contrast with Gingrich's own personal history. [...] She had long been known within the family as the [...] "Mitt-stabilizer", due to the calming effect she <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> husband, and continued to perform that role during the up-and-down campaign. [...] In particular, she began appearing with him more often during February 2012 as he dueled with Rick Santorum during the Republican presidential primaries. [...] Regarding the couple's net worth, she alluded to her health problems and said, [...] "Look, I don't even consider myself wealthy, which is an interesting thing, it can be here today and gone tomorrow. And how I measure riches is by the friends I have and the loved ones that I have and the people that I care about in my life." ...|$|E

[...] Maybrick spent her first nine months in solitary confinement before being moved to a different cell but remaining under the strictures of the silent system whereby silence was enforced at all times. [...] Her memoirs reveal the physical and mental toll that solitary confinement <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>her.</b> [...] She dubbed the practice 'by far the most cruel feature of English penal servitude' and emphasised the 'desolation and despair' that the 'hopeless monotony' of confinement led her to feel.|$|E
2500|$|Lake's {{daughter}} Agnes Kirsopp Lake Michels was a noted classical scholar. [...] In {{later years}} she {{reflected on the}} impact he <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> life: [...] "my general interests should be attributed mainly {{to the influence of}} my father who was a New testament scholar with a classical education and a passionate love of beauty. [...] He told me the stories of the classics and, long before I could understand them, read to me a strange assortment of Browning and the Bible; Swinburne, Tennyson, and Josephus. [...] His attitude to his own work made me think of scholarship as the opening to a world of adventure, not as a retirement from reality." [...] His grandson Anthony Lake is a diplomat.|$|E

2500|$|The seventh {{track on}} Odd Blood, [...] "Rome", {{features}} beats taken from Moroccan and Syrian dance music that Keating's wife <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> iPod, while for [...] "Strange Reunions", Yeasayer created a short song under three minutes by exploring unconventional time signatures {{in different parts}} {{in the style of}} fellow New York City band Dirty Projectors. [...] "Mondegreen" [...] follows and is an old song created by Keating using samplers plugged into a television set. Using four channels which showed programs like infomercials and soap operas, he recorded four banks of sound and structured a song by singing on top of the material. The last track, [...] "Grizelda", is, according to Tuton, [...] "a nice way to close an album. It lulls you into sitting back in your chair, puts you in a trance a bit, although the subject matter might be a bit dark." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{her stay}} in the United States, Kenny faced many sceptical doctors and {{needed to get the}} American Medical Association's support for her method. The AMA {{director}} at that time saw her as an [...] "ignorant quack seeking money for her own gain". Some doctors found their initial professional scepticism groundless when they saw the effects Kenny's method <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> patients (both children and adults). Kenny was the subject of American magazine articles; however, Victor Cohn (who wrote the first detailed biography of her life and work) noted that her pursuit of publicity led journalists to tire of her campaign. During her first year in Minneapolis, the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis (NFIP) paid her personal expenses, and was financing and arranging trials of her work; that support ceased, however, after a series of disagreements. [...] Kenny was a determined and outspoken woman, which irritated the NFIP director (and many doctors). Her method of treatment continued to be used to treat hundreds of children suffering from polio.|$|E

The singer took more of a [...] "hands-on role", co-writing more material than she <b>had</b> <b>on</b> <b>her</b> previous albums. The album was titled This Is Me... Then, as it was something she wanted to look back on in retrospection. Lopez explained, [...] "Who you are at that time, what kind of music you like, what kind of beats you're into, what kind of state of mind you're in, what you're attracted to ... it's all very telling of where you are in your life at that point. ... Twenty years from now, if I give this [...] to one of my kids, I'll be like, 'This was me then, at that moment.'" [...] Lopez dedicated the album to Affleck, with the words [...] "You are my life ... my sole inspiration for every lyric, every emotion, every bit of feeling on this record" [...] written on the disc jacket.|$|E
