5|$|For Upper Bonnington, {{the first}} dam {{built on the}} river, the {{original}} goal was to improve navigation between Kootenay Lake and the Kootenay's mouth on the Columbia by drowning the dangerous Bonnigton Falls rapids that also blocked fish migration, and hopefully introducing fish to the upper river by constructing a <b>fish</b> <b>ladder.</b> None of these amenities for steamboats or salmon were ever constructed—in fact, the dam ended up being built above the falls instead of below them—and Upper Bonnington Dam, when completed in 1906, only generated hydroelectric power, and has served that purpose ever since.|$|E
5|$|Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River {{are both}} open for fishing. The North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission (NCWRC) has {{established}} fishing regulations, such as catch and length limits, that {{are meant to}} enhance sport fisheries in public waters such as Lake Phelps and the Scuppernong River. The NCWRC has had regulations in place at Pettigrew State Park since 2002. The regulations specify that anglers may keep largemouth bass that are greater than 20inches (50.8cm) or between 14 and 16inches (35.6-40.6cm). This rule {{was put in place}} {{to increase the number of}} tropy fish, fish over 20inches (50.8cm). Additionally the NCWRC stocks Lake Phelps with bluegill and they have begun a program to reintroduce alewife and blueback herring via <b>fish</b> <b>ladder</b> on Bee Tree Canal from the Scuppernong River.|$|E
5|$|Irrigation {{with water}} from the Merced River {{continued}} to grow substantially until most of the arable land around the river, some , was under cultivation. By the late 1950s and early 1960s, irrigation in the San Joaquin Valley was {{to such an extent}} that many of the rivers ran dry in sections. Upriver of the Merced River confluence with the San Joaquin, the latter river was usually dry, only regaining flow where the Merced River enters. In the mid-20th century, the flow in the Merced River diminished to such a degree that very few salmon returned to spawn in the lower section of the Merced River. In 1991, a fish hatchery, the Merced River Hatchery, was built beside the Merced River just downstream of the Crocker-Huffman Diversion Dam, the lowermost Merced River dam. Fall chinook salmon travel up a <b>fish</b> <b>ladder</b> into the hatchery's pools, which are supplied with water diverted from the Merced River.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In 2000 and 2005, <b>fish</b> <b>ladders</b> {{were built}} in Vilnia and Siesartis rivers {{providing}} fish access to another 10 and 25 km of the rivers respectively. The analysis of redd distribution and abundance in both rivers revealed that the construction of <b>fish</b> <b>ladders</b> significantly increased the number and share of redds above dams, however, {{a significant increase in}} redds above the dam occurred 2 - 4 years after <b>fish</b> <b>ladders</b> construction supporting homing behaviour {{as one of the most}} important factors for the recolonization of the newly accessible habitats. The tracking of radio tagged salmon and sea trout revealed that statis-tically, significantly more time, fishes spent in the middle part of <b>fish</b> <b>ladders.</b> Assessed <b>fish</b> <b>ladders</b> efficiency for migrating salmonids made 66 %. Minor construction defects and lack of protection were the main factors reducing fishway efficiency. Based on radio tracking data, recommendations are given for minor changes in <b>fish</b> <b>ladders</b> construction and operating sched-ule to increase the efficiency of <b>fish</b> <b>ladders...</b>|$|R
40|$|In Queensland the {{construction}} of a number ofweirs and tidal barrages has created barriers to the passage of <b>fish.</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>ladders</b> have been incorporated in a number of structures with varying degrees of success. Conventional <b>fish</b> <b>ladders</b> are clearly constrained in the height they can achieve, both {{from the point of view}} of cost, and from the stamina of the fish. The Queensland Water Resources Commission has therefore engaged the Zoology Dept of the Univ of Queensland to investigate the suitability of Denil <b>fish</b> <b>ladders.</b> The purpose of this paper is to provide a very brief commentary on some experience with conventional <b>fish</b> <b>ladders</b> and to outline the progress on the Denil research...|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} design had <b>fish</b> <b>ladders</b> which were twice destroyed by floods {{shortly after the}} dam's completion. The Washington State Fisheries Department then required Northwestern Electric {{to participate in a}} fish hatchery instead of rebuilding the <b>fish</b> <b>ladders.</b> This ended natural salmonid migration on the river.|$|R

25|$|In June 2003, the Scouts {{agreed to}} install a <b>fish</b> <b>ladder,</b> modify the dam's spillway, educate Scouts at camp about {{threatened}} species, and enhance the stream bed habitat for fish. Instead of paying a fine, the San Francisco Chronicle reported in 2006 that the council paid more than $1 million, including legal fees, to construct a custom <b>fish</b> <b>ladder</b> for use when the dam is full and a juvenile vertical-slot fish passage ladder in the spillway. The <b>fish</b> <b>ladder</b> is a unique design that allows the fish to swim upstream or downstream when the flashboards are installed. The design had not {{been used in the}} United States beforehand. It was designed by Swanson Hydrology + Geomorphology and built by Don Chapin Company. The fish ladders significantly improved fish passage.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on revitalization of aquatic environments by using a <b>fish</b> <b>ladders.</b> Rivers have been adjusted and built by use of transverse structures and obstacles that cause insurmountable barrier for migration of aquatic organisms. In this work are described particular <b>fish</b> <b>ladders,</b> transverse obstacles found in watercourses and description of interested watershed. There is also {{an evaluation of the}} two selected parts of the revitalized watercourse in the city of Bulhary and Břeclav. We evaluated the <b>fish</b> <b>ladders,</b> its functionality and we also suggested the recommended actions for its optimization...|$|R

25|$|Older dams {{often lack}} a <b>fish</b> <b>ladder,</b> which keeps many fish from moving {{upstream}} to their natural breeding grounds, causing failure of breeding cycles or blocking of migration paths. Even {{the presence of}} a <b>fish</b> <b>ladder</b> does not always prevent a reduction in fish reaching the spawning grounds upstream. In some areas, young fish ("smolt") are transported downstream by barge during parts of the year. Turbine and power-plant designs that have a lower impact upon aquatic life are an active area of research.|$|E
25|$|If {{excessive}} {{salt water}} {{were allowed to}} migrate into Salmon Bay, the salt could eventually damage the freshwater ecosystem. To prevent this, a basin was dredged just above (east of) the large lock. The heavier salt water settles into the basin and drains through a pipe discharging downstream of the locks area. In 1975, the saltwater drain was modified to divert some salt water from the basin to the <b>fish</b> <b>ladder,</b> where it is added via a diffuser to the <b>fish</b> <b>ladder</b> attraction water; see below.|$|E
25|$|On September 8, 1949, {{the water}} behind {{the lock and}} dam was {{scheduled}} to be lowered to to allow repairs to be made to the dam and <b>fish</b> <b>ladder.</b>|$|E
25|$|There are 190 dams in the St. Joseph River watershed, and 17 on {{the river}} mainstem. Most of these dams block fish passage, {{although}} <b>fish</b> <b>ladders</b> constructed on the lower dams allow salmonine passage {{as far as the}} Twin Branch Dam in Mishawaka, Indiana. But, the <b>fish</b> <b>ladders</b> are not adequate for many native species, such as sturgeon, and the dams tend to be built on the higher gradient portions of the river, which are the most critical river habitats for fish spawning.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>ladders</b> have a mixed {{record of}} {{effectiveness}}. They vary in effectiveness for {{different types of}} species, with one study showing that only three percent of American Shad make it through all the <b>fish</b> <b>ladders</b> {{on the way to}} their spawning ground. Effectiveness depends on the fish species' swimming ability, and how the fish moves up and downstream. A fish passage that is designed to allow fish to pass upstream may not allow passage downstream, for instance. Fish passages do not always work.|$|R

25|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{irrigation}} projects on the Tongue River is the T Ditch, which dates from 1886. The diversion dam from the T ditch was recently altered to include a <b>fish</b> <b>ladder,</b> which now allows fish from the Tongue and Yellowstone Rivers below the dam to migrate upriver, {{for the first time}} in 125 years.|$|E
25|$|In December 2012, the Santa Clara Council and the Monterey Bay Area Council were reunited {{after being}} {{separate}} councils since 1933.

25|$|Fish Ladders. The {{construction}} of locks (or weirs and dams) on rivers obstructs {{the passage of}} fish. Some fish such as lampreys, trout and salmon go upstream to spawn. Measures such as a <b>fish</b> <b>ladder</b> are often taken to counteract this. Navigation locks have also potential to be operated as fishways to provide increased access {{for a range of}} biota.|$|E

25|$|The ladder was {{designed}} to use attraction water: fresh water flowing swiftly out {{the bottom of the}} <b>fish</b> <b>ladder,</b> in the direction opposite which anadromous fish migrate {{at the end of their}} lives. However, the attraction water from this first ladder was not effective. Instead, most salmon used the locks. This made them an easy target for predators; also, many were injured by hitting the walls and gates of the locks, or by hitting boat propellers.|$|E
25|$|The {{offspring}} {{remain in}} the fresh water until {{they are ready to}} migrate to the ocean as smolts. In a few years, the surviving adults return, climb the <b>fish</b> <b>ladder,</b> and reach their spawning ground to continue the life cycle. Of the millions of young fish born, only a relative few survive to adulthood. Causes of death include natural predators, commercial and sport fishing, disease, low stream flows, poor water quality, flooding, and concentrated developments along streams and lakes.|$|E
25|$|Written {{reports of}} rough fish ladders date to 17th-century France, where bundles of {{branches}} {{were used to}} create steps in steep channels to bypass obstructions. A version was patented in 1837 by Richard McFarlan of Bathurst, New Brunswick, Canada, who designed a fishway to bypass a dam at his water-powered lumber mill. In 1880, the first <b>fish</b> <b>ladder</b> was built in Rhode Island, United States, on the Pawtuxet Falls Dam. As the Industrial Age advanced, dams and other river obstructions became larger and more common, leading {{to the need for}} effective fish by-passes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fish</b> <b>ladders,</b> or fishways, are {{specially}} {{designed to help}} salmon and other fish to bypass dams and other man made obstructions, and continue on to their spawning grounds further upriver.|$|R
50|$|The key {{disadvantage}} of optical counters {{is the small}} penetration of the beams through the water, restricting their use to narrow river features or in-river structures, such as <b>fish</b> <b>ladders.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{installation}} of dams dramatically altered {{the landscape and}} ecosystem of the river. At one time, the Columbia {{was one of the}} top salmon-producing river systems in the world. Previously active fishing sites, such as Celilo Falls in the eastern Columbia River Gorge, have exhibited a sharp decline in fishing along the Columbia in the last century, and salmon populations have been dramatically reduced. <b>Fish</b> <b>ladders</b> have been installed at some dam sites to help the fish journey to spawning waters. Chief Joseph Dam has no <b>fish</b> <b>ladders</b> and completely blocks fish migration to the upper half of the Columbia River system.|$|R
25|$|Pacific salmon are anadromous; they hatch in lakes, rivers, and streams—or, {{nowadays}} fish hatcheries—migrate to sea, {{and only}} {{at the end of their}} life return to fresh water to spawn. When the Corps of Engineers first built the locks and dam, they changed the natural drainage route of Lake Washington. The locks and dam blocked all salmon runs out of the Cedar River watershed. To correct this problem, the Corps built a <b>fish</b> <b>ladder</b> as the locks were constructed to allow salmon to pass around the locks and dam.|$|E
25|$|The Ballard Locks {{carry more}} boat traffic {{than any other}} lock in the US, and the Locks, along with the <b>fish</b> <b>ladder</b> and the {{surrounding}} Carl S. English Jr. Botanical Gardens attract {{more than one million}} visitors annually, making it one of Seattle's top tourist attractions. The construction of the locks profoundly reshaped the topography of Seattle and the surrounding area, lowering the water level of Lake Washington and Lake Union by , adding miles of new waterfront land, reversing the flow of rivers, and leaving piers in the eastern half of Salmon Bay high and dry. The Locks are listed on the National Register of Historic Places and the American Society of Civil Engineers Historic Civil Engineering Landmarks.|$|E
25|$|Further {{improvements}} to the Lundwood sewage treatment works began in 2007 to enable it {{to comply with the}} Freshwater Fish Directive, and although the site was inundated during the floods of 2007, the scheme, which cost £8 million, was completed in 2008. To celebrate the opening of the new works, the poet Ian McMillan was asked to run a poetry workship at Littleworth Grange Primary Learning Centre, where children completed a poem about water treatment for which he supplied the first two lines. In June 2015, the Environment Agency announced that salmon had returned to the Dearne {{for the first time in}} 150 years. This follows the opening of a <b>fish</b> <b>ladder</b> at Sprotborough weir in 2014.|$|E

40|$|During the 1960 s, as more dams {{went into}} full {{operation}} on the Columbia River, {{it was discovered}} that the passage of American shad Alosa sapidissima was restricted or completely blocked through the regulating sections of some of the <b>fish</b> <b>ladders.</b> To study the problem, a full-scale laboratory model of six pools of the regulating section of the <b>fish</b> <b>ladders</b> at John Day Dam was built. American shad, chinook salmon Oncorhynchus tshawytscha, sockeye salmon O. nerka, and steelhead O. mykiss (formerly Salmo gairdneri) were counted and timed through various weir designs at different heads. American shad oriented toward surface flows, tending to reject submerged orifices as shallow as 2 m. The amount of time spent in the ladder by American shad depended on the head between pools. The species of salmonids tested were not significantly impeded by any of the weir designs or head differentials. The results of these studies were used to develop new design criteria for the regulating sections of <b>fish</b> <b>ladders.</b> These criteria have been used in modifications of existing structures and in the design of new facilities...|$|R
