The Japanese company Showa <b>High</b> <b>Polymer,</b> built in 1993 a semi-commercial plant able to produce 3,000 tons of polymer per year. Sold under the tradename Bionolle, these polyesters are synthesized via melt condensation polymerization followed by a chain-extension with a diisocyanate.Much later, in April 2003, Mitsubishi Chemicals built a 3,000 tons/year capacity and launched to the market a PBS named GS Pla (Green and Sustainable Plastic). This polymer has high molar masses without the use of a chain extender. Since then, several PBS producers such as Hexing Chemical (Anhui, China), Xinfu Pharmaceutical (Hangzhou, China) or IRe Chemical (South Korea) appeared on the market.In 2010 Hexing Chemical became China's first large-scale PBS enterprise, with the annual capacity of 10,000 tons. The same year Xinfu Pharmaceutical announced the building up of the world's largest continuous PBS production line with an annual capacity of 20,000 tons.At the moment most of these poly(alkylene succinate)s are synthesized from petrochemical precursors. Nevertheless most of the producers are evaluating or developing bio-based succinic acid for the synthesis of these polyesters.

5000|$|The formal {{thermodynamic}} {{criterion of}} a given monomer polymerizability is related to {{a sign of the}} free enthalpy (Gibbs free energy) of polymerization:where x and y indicate monomer and polymer states, respectively (x and/or y = l (liquid), g (gaseous), c (amorphous solid), c’ (crystalline solid), s (solution)), ΔHp(xy) and ΔSp(xy) are the corresponding enthalpy (SI unit: joule per kelvin) and entropy (SI unit: joule) of polymerization, and T is the absolute temperature (SI unit: kelvin).The free enthalpy of polymerization (ΔGp) may be expressed as a sum of standard enthalpy of polymerization (ΔGp°) and a term related to instantaneous monomer molecules and growing macromolecules concentrations: where R is the gas constant, M is the monomer, (m)i is the monomer in an initial state, and m* is the active monomer.Following Flory-Huggins solution theory that the reactivity of an active center, located at a macromolecule of a sufficiently long macromolecular chain, does not depend on its degree of polymerization (DPi), and taking in to account that ΔGp° = ΔHp° - TΔSp° (where ΔHp° and ΔSp° indicate a standard polymerization enthalpy and entropy, respectively), we obtain: At equilibrium (ΔGp = 0), when polymerization is complete the monomer concentration (Meq) assumes a value determined by standard polymerization parameters (ΔHp° and ΔSp°) and polymerization temperature:Polymerzation is possible only when M0 > Meq. Eventually, at or above the so-called ceiling temperature (Tc), at which Meq = M0, formation of the <b>high</b> <b>polymer</b> does not occur. For example, tetrahydrofuran (THF) cannot be polymerized above Tc = 84 °C, nor cyclo-octasulfur (S8) below Tf = 159 °C. [...] However, for many monomers, Tc and Tf, for polymerization in the bulk, are well above or below the operable polymerization temperatures, respectively.The polymerization of a majority of monomers is accompanied by an entropy decrease, due mostly to the loss in the translational degrees of freedom. In this situation, polymerization is thermodynamically allowed only when the enthalpic contribution into ΔGp prevails (thus, when ΔHp° < 0 and ΔSp° < 0, the inequality |ΔHp| > -TΔSp is required). Therefore, the higher the ring strain, the lower the resulting monomer concentration at equilibrium.|$|E
