500|$|Milian met actor Nick Cannon {{on the set}} {{of their}} film, Love Don't Cost a Thing, in 2003, and they began dating. After being {{together}} {{for two and a half}} years, Milian ended her relationship with Cannon in 2005 because of his cheating. Cannon revealed that he refused to stay faithful to Milian because their relationship was becoming too much like a [...] "Christian romance". When Cannon married Mariah Carey on April 30, 2008, Milian said, [...] "regardless of what <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> the past at the time, I actually forgive him and I'm very much over that." ...|$|E
500|$|Carte's children's {{production}} earned enthusiastic {{reviews from}} the critic Clement Scott {{and the other}} London critics, {{as well as the}} audiences, including children. However, Captain Corcoran's curse [...] "Damme!" [...] was uncensored, shocking such prominent audience members as Lewis Carroll, who later wrote: [...] "a bevy of sweet innocent-looking girls sing, with bright and happy looks, the chorus 'He said, Damn me! He said, Damn me!' I cannot find words to convey to the reader the pain <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> seeing those dear children taught to utter such words to amuse ears grown callous to their ghastly meaning... How Mr. Gilbert could have stooped to write, or Sir Arthur Sullivan could have prostituted his noble art to set to music, such vile trash, it passes my skill to understand".|$|E
500|$|Swift {{began writing}} [...] "Fifteen" [...] with the lyric [...] "And Abigail gave {{everything}} she had to a boy/ Who changed his mind/ We both cried", which eventually became the song's bridge, and continued writing everything else in a backwards manner. The song was written about Swift's freshman {{year of high school}} at Hendersonville High School, where she met her best friend Abigail Anderson. [...] "I just decided I really wanted to tell that story about our first year of high school because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> my freshman year, I grew up more than any year in my life so far", Swift stated. The events it focused on were how both Swift and Anderson fell in love for the first time, but both suffered of heartbreaks. Aside from reminiscing on the events she and Anderson experienced, Swift wrote cautionary lyrics, intended to target teenage girls entering or already in their freshman year of high school. She described it as incorporating things she wished someone would have told her in a song when she was younger. [...] "The thing about high school, you don't know anything. You don't know anything, but you think you know everything", Swift said.|$|E

500|$|The Green Goblin {{debuted in}} The Amazing Spider-Man #14. At this time his {{identity}} was unknown, but he proved popular and reappeared in later issues, which {{made a point}} of his secret identity. According to both Stan Lee and John Romita, Sr., who replaced Ditko as the title's artist, Lee always wanted the Green Goblin to be someone Peter Parker knew, while Ditko wanted his civilian identity to be someone who hadn't yet been introduced. Lee elaborated: [...] "Steve wanted him to turn out to be just some character that we had never seen before. Because, he said, in real life, very often a villain turns out to be somebody that you never knew. And I felt that that would be wrong. <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> <b>in</b> a sense, it would be like cheating the reader. ... if it's somebody you didn't know and had never seen, then {{what was the point of}} following all the clues? I think that frustrates the reader." [...] However, Lee prefaced this statement by admitting that, due to his self-professed poor memory, he may have been confusing the Green Goblin with a different character, and in an earlier essay he had said that he could not remember whether Norman Osborn being the Green Goblin was his idea or Ditko's. Ditko has maintained that it was his idea, even claiming that he had decided on it before the first Green Goblin story was finished, and that a character he drew in the background of a single panel of Amazing Spider-Man #23 was meant to be Norman Osborn (who is not introduced until issue #37).|$|E
2500|$|Our Norma {{is decidedly}} a great success. If you heard how it's {{performed}} in Bergamo, you'd almost {{think that it}} was a new work... even moves me. [...] In fact, I wept [...] the emotions <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> my soul. [...] I wanted you near me so that I could have these emotions with you, my good advisor and collaborator, because you along understand me. [...] My glory is intrinsic to yours.|$|E
2500|$|Amos had {{initially}} planned {{to record the}} entire album in the American South because [...] "there's a hiddenness about the South, and I {{wanted to go back}} there because it was similar to how <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> my relationships with men," [...] but the bulk of the record was recorded in a church in County Wicklow, Ireland, as well as in New Orleans, Louisiana. Given her religious upbringing, Amos was drawn to record in a church, not in anger, but [...] "with the intention of wholeness and of bringing a fragmented woman back to freedom." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{struggled}} to my knees, and if ever <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> terrified <b>in</b> my life it was then, and I am not {{ashamed to say}} that I hesitated and hung back.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> every nerve <b>in</b> my body shudder at {{the sight}} of the child.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>I</b> was <b>in</b> England again, {{and really}} was quite cast down on Traddles's account. There {{seemed to be}} no hope for him. I meekly ordered a bit of fish and a steak, and stood before the fire musing on his obscurity.|$|R
2500|$|Through her {{friendship}} with, {{and eventual}} engagement to Edward, at age 15 in June 1856, {{she was able}} to visit the studio where he worked with Rossetti and Morris. She was also introduced to John Ruskin. She said, [...] "I wish it were possible to explain the impression made upon me as a young girl whose experience so far had been quite remote from art, by sudden and close intercourse with those to whom it was the breath of life... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> the presence of a new religion." ...|$|E
2500|$|At seventeen, Emily {{attended}} the Roe Head Girls' School, where Charlotte {{was a teacher}} but managed to stay {{only a few months}} before being overcome by extreme homesickness. Charlotte later stated that: [...] "Liberty was the breath of Emily's nostrils; without it she perished. The change from her own home to a school and from her own very noiseless, very secluded but unrestricted and unartificial mode of life, to one of disciplined routine (though under the kindest auspices), was what she failed in enduring... <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> my heart she would die, if she did not go home, and with this conviction obtained her recall." [...] She returned home and Anne took her place. At this time, the girls' objective was to obtain sufficient education to open a small school of their own.|$|E
2500|$|... "I {{found it}} {{difficult}} to believe in the way my parents lived. They seemed so utterly taken up with engagements, obligations, ceremonies," [...] Merrill would tell an interviewer in 1982. [...] "The excitement, the emotional quickening <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> those years came usually through animals or nature, or through the servants in the house [...] [...] [...] whose lives seemed by contrast to make such perfect sense. The gardeners had their hands in the earth. The cook was dredging things with flour, making pies. My father was merely making money, while my mother wrote names on place-cards, planned menus, and did her needlepoint." [...] Merrill's parents separated when he was eleven, then divorced when he was thirteen. [...] As a teenager, Merrill boarded at the Lawrenceville School, where he befriended future novelist Frederick Buechner, began writing poetry, and undertook early literary collaborations. [...] When Merrill was 16 years old, his father collected his short stories and poems and published them as a surprise under the name Jim's Book. [...] Initially pleased, Merrill would later regard the precocious book as an embarrassment. Today, it is considered a literary treasure worth thousands of dollars.|$|E
6000|$|... "D'ye {{remember}} {{that time we}} parted at the Hot Springs?" [...] the other was saying. [...] "I said then we'd meet again. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it <b>in</b> my bones. An' here we are." ...|$|R

60|$|I shuddered as he spoke: <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> his {{influence}} <b>in</b> my marrow--his hold on my limbs.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> (<b>in</b> these moments) that I was {{not worthy}} to be descended.|$|E
60|$|Yet it was unaccountable to myself, the {{interest}} that <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> him.|$|E
60|$|As I spoke <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> {{my pocket}} {{to make sure}} that the amount was still safe.|$|E
60|$|These {{were days}} of {{security}} and tranquillity, and good friends thickened. Each week <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> myself <b>in</b> less danger of being obliged to shingle, though I still had difficulty in clothing myself properly.|$|R
60|$|I {{runs around}} to {{the light of the}} big blaze, and pulls the Handbook out of my inside pocket. I kind of laughed when <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it <b>in</b> my hands --I reckon I was some daffy with the {{sensation}} of excitement.|$|R
60|$|If I {{only had}} been one of the {{characters}} in my story instead of myself I could easily have offered $10 or $25 or even $100. But $2 was all <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> justified <b>in</b> expending, with fiction at its present rates.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} him but did not answer, for {{to tell the truth}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> no mood for argument.|$|E
60|$|I had {{answered}} {{in a kind of}} breathless whisper, but <b>I</b> <b>felt,</b> <b>in</b> my silence, that my breath was shorter now.|$|E
6000|$|... "I have no {{favorite}} restaurant," [...] she answered; [...] "only to-night <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> {{the humor}} for French cooking--and French service." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "He was an amazing, generous, caring guy but {{he would}} never cross boundaries. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{comfortable}} <b>in</b> his company. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> safe <b>in</b> his home and under his guardianship. The more time I spent at Crewe, I notice the caution he exercised within his role. ... For example, he wouldn’t come into the bedroom to wake you up {{but he would}} always shout through the door. ... I hate {{the fact that he}} might be doubted in any way or even remotely linked to such negativity and bad things. My experience is totally the opposite. ... I believe that if he had known what Barry Bennell had been doing, he would have put a stop to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{makes me}} know. <b>I</b> have <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> myself {{a long time}} that he was suffering; I have had the feeling of him in me. I knew, yes, I did know he wanted me, and you, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> it. <b>I</b> have had the feeling of him upon me this last three months {{especially}} [...] . I have been cruel to him." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>felt</b> some {{difficulty}} <b>in</b> opening my business to him. It {{was necessary to}} speak, however, at once--I began with an apology.|$|R
6000|$|... "I came from-- up a tree," [...] I {{returned}} lightly, and I may {{add that}} {{never before had}} <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> such particularly good humor.|$|E
60|$|I did so, without hesitation, looking him full in {{the face}} with {{heightened}} colour, but speaking with all the determination which <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> my heart.|$|E
60|$|Happily, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> myself {{complete}} power to manage my pupils without aid; the enchantment, the golden haze which had dazzled my perspicuity at first, {{had been a}} good deal dissipated. I cannot say I was chagrined or downcast by the contrast which the reality of a pensionnat de demoiselles presented to my vague ideal of the same community; I was only enlightened and amused; consequently, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>in</b> no disposition to complain to Mdlle. Reuter, and I received her considerate invitation to confidence with a smile.|$|E
60|$|As Mr. Hitchcock {{had assured}} {{me there was}} money <b>in</b> his offer, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> {{justified}} <b>in</b> speculating. <b>I</b> expended another three marks on the hire of a bicycle, though I ran the risk thereby of going perhaps without Monday's dinner. That showed my vocation. The Blighted Fraus, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> sure, would have clung to their dinner at all hazards.|$|R
60|$|The {{confession}} of love which the girl's fright had wrung from her touched me deeply; but it humiliated me as well, since <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>in</b> some thoughtless word or act I {{had given her}} {{reason to believe that}} I reciprocated her affection.|$|R
60|$|Without considering, perhaps, {{whether there}} were any {{consequences}} to be taken, <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> quite <b>in</b> a glow at this gallant speech. It made an impression on the boys too, for there was a low stir among them, though no one spoke a word.|$|R
