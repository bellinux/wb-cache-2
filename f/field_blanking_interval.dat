50|$|Vertical {{synchronization}} eliminates this by timing {{frame buffer}} fills {{to coincide with}} the vertical <b>blanking</b> <b>interval,</b> thus ensuring that only whole frames are seen on-screen. Software such as video games and computer aided design (CAD) packages often allow vertical synchronization as an option, because it delays the image update until the vertical <b>blanking</b> <b>interval.</b> This produces a small penalty in latency, because the program has to wait until the video controller has finished transmitting the image to the display before continuing. Triple buffering reduces this latency significantly.|$|R
50|$|Image {{data on the}} bus is {{interleaved}} with signals for {{horizontal and}} vertical <b>blanking</b> <b>intervals</b> (porches). The data is drawn to the display in real time and not stored by the device. This allows the manufacture of simpler display devices without frame buffer memory. However, {{it also means that}} the device must be continuously refreshed (at a rate such as 30 or 60 frames per second) or it will lose the image. Image data is only sent in HS mode. When in HS mode, commands are transmitted during the vertical <b>blanking</b> <b>interval.</b>|$|R

40|$|In the Netherlands <b>field</b> <b>blanks</b> are {{mandatory}} when sampling odour emission. <b>Field</b> <b>blanks</b> are matrices {{that have}} negligible or unmeasurable {{amounts of the}} substance of interest. They are used to document possible contamination during sampling, transport and storage of samples. Although <b>field</b> <b>blanks</b> are well established in odour emission research, interpreting the results needs further attention. This {{can be attributed to}} the fact that published information on the topic is rare if not absent. In the present study, general statistical measures of <b>field</b> <b>blanks</b> used in odour measurement research, are reported. The objective of the study was to provide insight in the distribution of <b>field</b> <b>blank</b> values. During 2013 and 2014, <b>field</b> <b>blanks</b> were analysed as part of regular investigations into odour emissions. Point sources were most frequently observed (87 %), as well as the use of diluting stack samplers (72 %). It was found that average odour concentration and standard deviation of the dataset were 1. 39 and 0. 379 log(ouE/m 3) respectively, both expressed on a logarithmic scale (base 10). Median values of odour concentration of <b>field</b> <b>blanks</b> taken with stack sampler methods, differed significantly from lung sample methods, being a factor two higher. Since the implementation of stack sampler methods requires more processing aids than the lung method, the chances are that that traces of odour are carried over from one sampling sessions to another. This stresses the need for effective cleaning of sampling equipment between sampling sessions. </p...|$|R

The insertion of 96 bits of digital data into two lines of the vertical <b>blanking</b> <b>interval</b> is reviewed. The automatic retrieval and reformatting of the digital data for use by a Main-Frame Computer is explored. A unique video editing and data merging facility coupled to the computer is described.

50|$|V-chip {{technology}} works {{much like}} closed captioning {{and uses the}} vertical <b>blanking</b> <b>interval</b> in the television signal. The system receives a special code in the broadcast signal which indicates the show's score according to a simple numerical rating system for violence, sex, and language. The programs' signals are encoded according to their rating, on line 21 of the broadcast signal's vertical <b>blanking</b> <b>interval</b> using the XDS protocol, and this is detected by the television set's V-chip. If the program rating is outside the level configured as acceptable on that particular television the program is blocked. The V-chip does not block infomercial, news or sportcasts as this sort of programming does not have ratings.|$|R

Transmitting data from experiments on the Space Shuttle Orbiter over a video channel is attractive since extra channel capacity is needed. Broadcast television telecommunications schemes and other techniques described in the literature were reviewed and compared. PSK (Phase Shift Keying), MPSK (m-ary PSK), or PAM (Pulse Amplitude Modulation) can be transmitted on visible lines of a frame, unassigned lines of the VBI (Vertical <b>Blanking</b> <b>Interval),</b> or during the HBI (Horizontal <b>Blanking</b> <b>Interval).</b> All three modulation techniques can be attractive under the proper conditions. However, PAM on visible lines or during the VBI should be relatively easy to implement, provide adequate average data rates, and give acceptable BERs (Bit Error Rates) ...|$|R
50|$|In video games, the {{horizontal}} <b>blanking</b> <b>interval</b> {{was used to}} create some notable effects. Some methods of parallax scrolling use a raster effect to simulate depth in consoles that do not natively support multiple background layers or do not support enough background layers to achieve the desired effect. One {{example of this is}} in the game Castlevania: Rondo of Blood, which was written for the PC Engine CD-ROM which does not support multiple background layers. The Super NES's Mode 7 used {{the horizontal}} <b>blanking</b> <b>interval</b> to vary the scaling and rotation of one background layer on a scanline by scanline basis to create many different effects. The most famous and hyped effect of Mode 7 was to turn the background layer into a planar texture map.|$|R
