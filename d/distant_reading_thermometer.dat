This article considers the use of "distant reading" as theorized by Franco Moretti in his book by the same title and suggests that the method of literary analysis that uses such a metaphor should be aware and critical of that tradition. Moreover, this article suggests that we look to examples in literature, such as ekphrastic poetry by women for possible alternative approaches to reading at a distance as an approach to large corpora of text. Essentially, a feminist approach to <b>distant</b> <b>reading</b> is possible and necessary, and this paper calls for making such work more central to our discussions of <b>distant</b> <b>reading</b> by literary scholars...|$|R

40|$|The {{on-going}} {{process of}} the mass digitisation of Dutch literature {{during the past two}} decades implies an increase in the digital analysis of such resources. This situation is not particular for the Netherlands: given the growing amount of the electronic book stack worldwide, one of the core questions in the field of digital humanities revolves around how to read a million books. As ‘opposed’ to the close reading practice we are used to in literary theory, Franco Moretti’s ‘distant reading’ focusses on a large group of texts, and the zooming out of that corpus by means of visualisations is bound to bring into view patterns that were not observable from close by. <b>Distant</b> <b>reading</b> is therefore rereading and rewriting literary history, an explaining of patterns rather than an interpreting of individual texts. This thesis serves as a test of these close and <b>distant</b> <b>reading</b> techniques, to see if we can indeed affirm, refute or nuance some assumptions in Dutch Literary Studies using digital reading methods. Generic assumptions can function as a good set of hypotheses for this purpose, as these make out a small portion of literary history, and as their definitions are often based on a few exemplary cases rather than all specimens attributed to the genre. The case study in this thesis involves the genre of Dutch mendacious songs, a relatively small genre of which only a handful of assumptions on its definition exist. Mendacious songs contain impossibilities and a lying narrative instance, and are set in a wonderland, such as ‘Luilekkerland’: ‘’k Zag twee beren broodjes smeren’ is an example of such songs. How can we (re) define this genre by close and <b>distant</b> <b>reading</b> a small and large corpus of these songs respectively...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of Social Network Analysis (SNA) for {{individual}} historians, {{by focusing on the}} correspondence archives of Rosey E. Pool (1905 - 1971). Pool’s position in her international network of writers and scholars will be examined through her contacts with Hoyt W. Fuller and Robert Hayden over the period 1966 to 1971. The different positions these three actors held towards The First World Festival of Negro Arts (Dakar, April 1966) will be examined. The Dakar Festival was an important and symbolic event in the transnational Négritude movement. Using the theories of ‘intersectionality’ and ‘collective identity,’ Pool’s network will be analysed by focusing on specific religious and personal features that have influenced the dynamics of her network. A deeper insight of this specific period will be provided by performing a close reading of key letters and by placing the correspondence in its historical context. At the same time, {{the use of}} <b>distant</b> <b>reading</b> will be discussed, by dissecting and inspecting a visualisation (made with Gephi) of a database based on Pool’s ego-centred network. I will argue that the two approaches of close and <b>distant</b> <b>reading</b> are inseparable in historical research that makes use of Social Network Analysis...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{develops}} a hermeneutic {{commensurate with the}} aesthetic and ontological challenges of what Steven Shaviro describes as a post-cinematic media ecology, and Shane Denson describes as an emergent post-perceptual media ecology. I consider canonicity and cinephilia as frustrated efforts to contain and comprehend this new cinematic media object, offering a third unit of interpretation in their place, which I describe as the cinetopic anecdote. I associate the cinetopic anecdote with a particular way of moving between cinema and cinematic infrastructure, which I label cinetopic passage, and with a subject position that I label the cinepheur. Drawing on Walter Benjamin’s theory of the flâneur, I argue that the cinetopic anecdote precludes the extraction of a privileged cinematic moment in the manner characteristic of Christian Keathley’s cinephilic anecdote, but instead compels the cinepheur to instantiate, embody or physically recreate the infrastructural conditions that produced it, dovetailing production and consumption into what Axel Bruns has described as the emergent category of produsage; “unfinished artifacts, continuing process. ” Having elaborated the cinetopic anecdote, I apply it to postmodern, post-cinematic and post-perceptual media ecologies, in order to evoke the peculiar forms of attachment and obsession {{bound up with the}} Criterion and Netflix platforms. In the process, I draw on Franco Moretti’s conception of <b>distant</b> <b>reading</b> to frame the cinetopic anecdote as a unit of distant viewing, offering distant viewings of Angela Christlieb and Stephen Kijak’s Cinemania, Sidney Lumet’s Garbo Talks and Pier Paolo Pasolini’s Salò, or The 120 Days of Sodom.

40|$|Hypothermia in newborn babies is {{a problem}} in {{tropical}} countries despite warm environmental conditions and it contributes to neonatal morbidity and mortality. This cohort study was done in the Neonatal Care unit, Muhimbili Medical Centre to determine the prevalence of hypothermia on admission, associated factors and neonatal outcome in terms of morbidity, weight loss, duration of stay in the neonatal unit and mortality. The study was conducted from July to October 1996 and the study population included all neonates admitted to the Neonatal Care Unit during the said period. The prevalence of hypothermia on admission was found to be 22. 4 % and hypothermia was not recorded or reported to be a reason for admission in any of the neonates in this study, despite that 13. 1 % of the hypothermic neonates had severe hypothermia on admission. There was no low <b>reading</b> <b>thermometer</b> in the unit. Hypothermia on admission was significantly associated with maternal intrapartum medications (P = 0. 04), delivery by doctor (P = 0. 000), delivery at Muhimbili Medical Centre Obstetrics Theatre (P = 0. 000) or delivery in other hospitals(p = 0. 00), delivery by lower segment Caesarian section (P = 0. 000) or by low cavity vaccum extraction (P = 0. 01), low birth weight (P = 0. 002), prematurity (P = 0. 001), longer duration of transfer from place of delivery to the Neonatal Care Unit (P = 0. 000) and inadequate clothing ofthe baby after delivery (P = 0. 000).
