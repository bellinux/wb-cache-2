5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan were {{suddenly}} in demand to write more operas together. Over the next two years, Richard D'Oyly Carte and Carl Rosa were two of several theatrical managers who negotiated with the team but were unable to come to terms. Carte proposed a revival of Thespis for the 1875 Christmas season, which <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan would have revised, but {{he was unable to}} obtain financing for the project. In early 1876, Carte requested that <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan create another one-act opera on the theme of burglars, but this was never completed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan scored {{their first}} {{international}} hit with H.M.S. Pinafore (1878), satirising {{the rise of}} unqualified people to positions of authority and poking good-natured fun at the Royal Navy and the English obsession with social status (building on a theme introduced in The Sorcerer, love between members of different social classes). As {{with many of the}} <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan operas, a surprise twist changes everything dramatically {{near the end of the}} story.|$|E

5|$|Recordings of {{excerpts}} from the <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan operas began {{to be released in}} 1906. In 1917, the Gramophone Company (also known as HMV) produced the first album of a complete musical score of a <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan opera, The Mikado, followed by recordings of eight more of the operas. Electrical recordings of the complete musical scores of most of the operas were then issued by the Gramophone Company and Victor Talking Machine Company beginning in the late 1920s. These recordings were supervised by Rupert D'Oyly Carte. The original D'Oyly Carte Opera Company continued to produce well-regarded recordings until 1979, helping to keep the operas popular through the decades. Many of these recordings have been reissued on CD. After the copyrights on the operas expired, other professional companies were free to perform and record the operas. Many performing companies arose to produce the works, such as <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan for All in Britain and the Light Opera of Manhattan and Light Opera Works in the U.S., and existing companies, such as English National Opera and Australian Opera added <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan to their repertories. These companies also released popular audio and video recordings of the operas. In 1966 and again in the 1980s, BBC Radio presented complete cycles of the thirteen extant <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan operas, with dialogue. In 1980, a Broadway and West End production of Pirates produced by Joseph Papp brought new audiences to <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan, and between 1988 and 2003, the revived D'Oyly Carte Opera Company revived the operas on tour and on the West End, also recording seven of the operas. A set of eleven of the operas (omitting the last two) was produced in 1982 for television, ten of which are available on VHS and DVD.|$|E
5|$|Star Trek {{has been}} blended with <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan at least twice. The North Toronto Players {{presented}} a Star Trek adaptation of Gilbert & Sullivan entitled H.M.S. Starship Pinafore: The Next Generation in 1991 and an adaptation by Jon Mullich of Gilbert & Sullivan's H.M.S. Pinafore {{that sets the}} operetta {{in the world of}} Star Trek has played in Los Angeles and was attended by series luminaries Nichelle Nichols, D.C. Fontana and David Gerrold. A similar blend of <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan and Star Trek was presented as a benefit concert in San Francisco by the Lamplighters in 2009. The show was entitled Star Drek: The Generation After That. It presented an original story with <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan melodies.|$|E

5|$|After {{the success}} of Trial by Jury, there were discussions towards {{reviving}} Thespis, but <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan {{were not able to}} agree on terms with Carte and his backers. The score to Thespis was never published, and most of the music is now lost. It took some time for Carte to gather funds for another <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan opera, and in this gap Gilbert produced several works including Tom Cobb (1875), Eyes and No Eyes (1875, his last German Reed Entertainment), and Princess Toto (1876), his last and most ambitious work with Clay, a three-act comic opera with full orchestra, as opposed to the shorter works for much reduced accompaniment that came before. Gilbert also wrote two serious works during this time, Broken Hearts (1875) and Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith (1876).|$|E
5|$|Barry Took, who had {{produced}} {{a series of}} ultimately unsuccessful documentaries for the BBC about working men's clubs, was partially responsible for the choice of location for the exterior shots. The programme which drew the highest ratings of the series focused on Burnlee Working Men's Club, a club in the small West Yorkshire town of Holmfirth and Took saw Holmfirth's potential as the backdrop of a television show. Took's idea was passed to James <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Roy Clarke via Duncan Wood, who {{was at that time}} filming Comedy Playhouse. <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Clarke then travelled to Holmfirth and decided to use it as the setting for the pilot of Last of the Summer Wine.|$|E

5|$|Carte {{started his}} career working for his father, Richard Carte, in the music {{publishing}} and musical instrument manufacturing business. As a young man, he conducted and composed music, but he soon turned to promoting the entertainment careers of others through his management agency. Carte believed that a school of wholesome, well-crafted, family-friendly, English comic opera could be as popular as the risqué French works dominating the London musical stage in the 1870s. To that end, he brought together the dramatist W. S. <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> composer Arthur Sullivan and, together with his wife Helen Carte, he nurtured their collaboration {{on a series of}} thirteen Savoy operas. He founded the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company and built the state-of-the-art Savoy Theatre to host the <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan operas.|$|E
5|$|During the company's 1975 centennial {{performances}} of all thirteen <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan Operas at the Savoy Theatre, Trial was given four times, as a curtain raiser to The Sorcerer, Pinafore and Pirates {{and as an}} afterpiece following The Grand Duke. Before {{the first of the}} four {{performances of}} Trial, a specially written curtain raiser by William Douglas-Home, called Dramatic Licence, was played by Peter Pratt as Carte, Kenneth Sandford as <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> John Ayldon as Sullivan, in which Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte plan the birth of Trial in 1875. Trial by Jury was eliminated from the D'Oyly Carte repertory in 1976 as a cost-saving measure.|$|E
5|$|During {{the years}} when the <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan operas were being written, Richard D'Oyly Carte also {{produced}} operas and plays by other writing teams, {{as well as other}} works to fill the Savoy Theatre in between new operas. Many of these were companion pieces to the <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan operas, as the Victorian audiences preferred long evenings in the theatre. Some, however, were new full-length pieces either for the Savoy or for Carte's touring companies, which toured the <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan operas, and these new works, extensively. Carte and Lenoir also continued to run his management agency. As an example of their level of activity, an 1881 souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of Patience in London and its 100th performance in New York states that, in addition to these two productions of Patience, Carte was simultaneously producing many other projects. These included two companies touring with Patience, two touring with other <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan operas, one touring with the operetta Olivette (co-produced with Charles Wyndham), one with Claude Duval in America, a production of Youth running at a New York theatre, a lecture tour by Archibald Forbes (a war correspondent) and productions of Patience, Pirates, Claude Duval and Billee Taylor in association with J. C. Williamson in Australia, among other things.|$|E

5|$|Gilbert next wrote The Mountebanks with Alfred Cellier and the flop Haste to the Wedding with George Grossmith, and Sullivan wrote Haddon Hall with Sydney Grundy. Gilbert {{eventually}} won the lawsuit, but {{his actions}} and statements had been hurtful to his partners. Nevertheless, the partnership {{had been so}} profitable that, after the financial failure of the Royal English Opera House, Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer. In late 1891, after many failed attempts at reconciliation, <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan's music publisher, Tom Chappell, stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks he had succeeded, eventually leading to two further collaborations between <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan.|$|E

5|$|In 1875, Richard D'Oyly Carte, who {{was then}} {{managing}} the Royalty Theatre for Selina Dolaro, brought <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan together to write their second show, a one-act opera entitled Trial by Jury. This proved a success, and in 1876 D'Oyly Carte assembled a group of financial backers to establish the Comedy Opera Company, which was devoted to the production and promotion of family-friendly English comic opera. With this theatre company, Carte finally had the financial resources, after many failed attempts, to produce a new full-length <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan opera. This next opera was The Sorcerer, which opened in November 1877. It too was successful, running for 178performances. Sheet music from the show sold well, and street musicians played the melodies.|$|E
5|$|On 31 July 1879, {{the last}} day of their {{agreement}} with Carte, the directors of the Comedy Opera Company attempted to repossess the Pinafore set by force during a performance, causing a celebrated fracas. Carte's stagehands managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery and props. The Comedy Opera Company opened a rival production of H.M.S. Pinafore in London, but it was not as popular as the D'Oyly Carte production and soon closed. Legal action over the ownership of the rights ended in victory for Carte, <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan. From 1 August 1879, the new company, later called the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, became the sole authorised producer of the works of <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan.|$|E
5|$|Other {{recordings}} {{have been}} made by opera companies such as <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan for All, and Australian Opera, among many others. Ad hoc companies of operatic singers conducted by Sir Malcolm Sargent in the 1950s and 60s and Sir Charles Mackerras in the 1990s have made audio sets of several Savoy operas, and in the 1980s Alexander Faris conducted video recordings of most of the operas with casts including show-business stars as well as professional singers. The long-running Broadway production of The Pirates of Penzance presented by Joseph Papp, re-orchestrated with synthesisers replacing the strings, was put on record in 1981. Since 1994, the International <b>Gilbert</b> <b>and</b> Sullivan Festival has released numerous professional and amateur CDs and videos of its productions and other Sullivan recordings.|$|E
