5|$|In 1855, Tchaikovsky's father funded {{private lessons}} with Rudolph Kündinger and {{questioned}} {{him about a}} musical career for his son. While impressed with the boy's talent, Kündinger said <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>nothing</b> to suggest a future composer or performer. He later admitted that his assessment was also based on his own negative experiences as a musician in Russia and his unwillingness for Tchaikovsky to be treated likewise. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.|$|E

After leaving the AEC in August 1951, he became Special Assistant to the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force for Development. In January 1952 he was appointed Director of Nuclear Applications at the Air Research and Development Center in Baltimore, Maryland. He was subsequently promoted to major general, and became Deputy Commander of the Air Research and Development Command. He was called to testify at the Oppenheimer security hearing.

500|$|Fatboy makes cameo {{appearances}} in series 2 of E20, where his argument with Naz continues in episode 1, and she steals back her money. Fatboy attends a dance audition, and witnesses Asher Levi (Heshima Thompson) bribing [...] (Tony Adigun) to let Asher's brother Sol (Tosin Cole) through {{even though he}} failed his audition. Asher threatens Fatboy with a knife, telling him that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>nothing.</b> In episode 5 Fatboy attends callbacks for the dance group, and in episode 7, he dances with the group again and helps break up a fight between Asher and Sol. In episode 10, Fatboy attends the dance-off between Skolla's crew and Flawless. He also appears in series 3. In episode 1, when Faith Olubunmi is homeless, she asks Fatboy if she can stay with him but he refuses.|$|E

"However, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>nothing</b> {{could be}} done on the instant, and adjourned the meeting for three weeks, {{at the end of which}} time the prelates, nobles, and {{community}} of Scotland were invited to bring forward whatever they could in opposition to his claim to supremacy.|$|R
60|$|After {{that there}} was hardly a letter that did not mention Kendall in some {{innocent}} fashion among the other boys and girls {{who took part in}} the sleigh-rides, parties, and sociables. But the morbidly acute Bert, if <b>he</b> <b>saw,</b> said <b>nothing,</b> and Anson did not see.|$|R
60|$|In the meanwhile, {{in answer}} to his uncle's {{repeated}} interrogations, he gave him an exact account of the accident which had that morning brought him into so much danger.

Phineas and Ferb made a cameo on [...] "The Straight-A Team" [...] episode of MAD when they decided to beat the Straight A-Team.

500|$|The {{following}} year, in 1909, Hogan {{relocated to}} Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he replaced local ball club manager Clarence [...] "Pop" [...] Foster, who had managed the Red Roses since 1907. [...] Once Hogan signed a contract, Foster {{moved on to}} lead another club in Trenton, New Jersey. [...] The Lancaster team's momentum escalated during the 1909 season, and in July of that year, Sporting Life reported that the Red Roses club was drawing positive attention. [...] "The fast pace at which the Lancaster bunch has been going lately has been {{the talk of the}} league", the paper stated. [...] "Marty Hogan was not given much consideration as a pennant aspirant when the season opened, but the plucky Red Roses manager has been 'sawing wood' and not talking". [...] Indeed, by the close of the 1909 season, the Lancaster Red Roses had worked up a 7539 record, seizing the championship of the Tri-State League. [...] As Spalding's Baseball Guide (1910) reported: [...] "Lancaster, under manager Marty Hogan, won its first pennant in the league, and the top rung of the ladder was only gained by the hardest kind of fighting". [...] Sporting Life indicated that Hogan was confident of the outcome early in the season. [...] "After his return from the first trip around the circuit", wrote reporter G. H. Hartley, [...] "Marty said to your correspondent that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>nothing</b> in the league that was better than his team". [...] Hartley noted that, on the closing day of the season, Hogan accepted the Farnsworth Cup, [...] "the Tri-State trophy", on behalf of his team. [...] "Between the first and second innings the [...] players presented Manager Marty Hogan with a beautiful silver set and a silver loving cup", he added. [...] The inscribed silver cup reportedly left Hogan [...] "so surprised that he was unable to respond". [...] On September 7, 1909, one day after the contest, the Reading Eagle stated, [...] "A great crowd witnessed the final game, in which Hogan's gallant band trimmed the Trenton wanderers". [...] The newspaper added, [...] "The real enthusiasm was awakened, however, by the floating of the championship pennant, awarded by a Phila. [...] paper". [...] A key participant in the team's successful performance was a young pitcher named Stan Coveleski, who went on to post a record of 53 wins and 38 losses during his three seasons with Lancaster. He made his professional debut with the Philadelphia Athletics three seasons later. [...] Indeed, the Ogden Standard had praised Hogan as a [...] "live wire" [...] back in February 1909, when he [...] "grabbed up the three brothers of Harry Coveleski of the Phillies, and had them all sign contracts". [...] Highlights of the season may have included an exhibition game with the Philadelphia Phillies, which was scheduled to be held in Lancaster on April 2, 1909.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the next}} two days, the Russians lulled their {{bombardment}} to collect the dead and wounded in the streets. Russian President Boris Yeltsin prematurely declared that the [...] "military stage of the operation" [...] was over. Gen.

6000|$|... "Oh! a most honourable, kind man." [...] But only by {{pressing}} her hand against her lips had she smothered {{a burst of}} bitter laughter. <b>He,</b> who <b>saw</b> <b>nothing,</b> could yet notice Fort's eyes {{when he looked at}} Noel, and be positive that {{he was in love with}} her! How plainly those eyes must speak! Her control gave way.|$|R
60|$|General Moore {{was indeed}} in a {{position}} of imminent danger; but the lying reports as to the strength of the Spanish army induced him for a moment to make preparations for such a movement. When, however, he learned the utter overthrow and dispersal of the whole of the Spanish armies, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>nothing</b> remained but to fall back, if possible, upon Portugal.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{saw that}} and not his face?" [...] once more insisted the coroner, making a final effort to draw some more {{definite}} statement out of the man. It would help justice so much if only this witness were less obstinate! No one would believe that <b>he</b> really <b>saw</b> <b>nothing</b> of {{the face of the}} man who had twice spoken to him. He may not have seen it clearly, not {{the upper part of the}} face perhaps, but surely <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> the mouth that had actually framed the words! ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1942, the Slovak chargé d'affaires told Pius that Slovak Jews {{were being}} sent to {{concentration}} camps. On 11 March 1942, several days before the first transport was due to leave, the chargé d'affaires in Bratislava reported to the Vatican: [...] "I have been assured that this atrocious plan is the handwork of ... Prime Minister (Tuka), who confirmed the plan ... he dared to tell me—he who makes such a show of his Catholicism—that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>nothing</b> inhuman or un-Christian in it ... the deportation of 80,000 persons to Poland, is equivalent to condemning {{a great number of}} them to certain death." [...] The Vatican protested to the Slovak government that it [...] "deplore(s) these... measures which gravely hurt the natural human rights of persons, merely because of their race." ...|$|E
2500|$|G. Christopher Williams also {{discussed}} {{the relationship between}} Wheatley and GLaDOS. His initial impression was that Wheatley, being an [...] "utter moron" [...] and attached to GLaDOS, was a political critique of the Presidency of George W. Bush. Namely, he {{thought that it would}} [...] "be a way of paralleling the mythos surrounding the origins of the Bush-Cheney White House as an opportunity for the Republicans to regain control of the White House through a less intellectually apt figurehead and to thus control their domain through this weaker authority figure"; however, as he progressed, <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>nothing</b> more to suggest that this was the intent. He added that the thought of this concept helped make him realize how Portal 2 [...] "presents a fundamental conundrum that does exist surrounding competency and power". In contrast to this, he wrote that [...] "an extremely smart leader can be about the most oppressive force in an organization has already been provided in abundance for anyone who has played the first Portal" [...] and that [...] "GLaDOS's [...] "leadership" [...] is the very definition of sadistic fascism". He {{also discussed}} the [...] "lack of choice" [...] for Chell, who is required to reinstate GLaDOS into her position to escape. He wrote that this lack of choice [...] "manages to effectively maintain its position on the relationship between the everyman and systems of power".|$|E
2500|$|A month passes; while Jack's writing goes nowhere, Danny and Wendy {{explore the}} hotel's hedge maze, and Hallorann goes to Florida. Wendy learns that {{the phone lines}} are out due to the heavy snowfall, and Danny has {{frightening}} visions. Jack, increasingly frustrated, starts behaving strangely and becomes prone to violent outbursts. Danny's curiosity about room 237 overcomes him {{when he sees the}} room's door open. Later, Wendy finds Jack screaming during a nightmare while asleep at his typewriter. After she awakens him, Jack says he dreamed that he killed her and Danny. Danny arrives and is visibly traumatized with a bruise on his neck, causing Wendy to accuse Jack of abusing him. Jack wanders into the hotel's Gold Room and meets a ghostly bartender named Lloyd. Lloyd serves him bourbon whiskey while Jack complains about his marriage. Wendy later tells Jack that Danny told her a [...] "crazy woman in one of the rooms" [...] attempted to strangle him. Jack investigates room 237, encountering the ghost of a dead woman, but tells Wendy that <b>he</b> <b>saw</b> <b>nothing.</b> Wendy and Jack argue over whether Danny should be removed from the hotel and a furious Jack returns to the Gold Room, now filled with ghosts attending a ball. He meets the ghost of Grady who tells Jack that he must [...] "correct" [...] his wife and child and that Danny has reached out to Hallorann using his [...] "talent". Meanwhile, Hallorann grows concerned about what's going on at the hotel and flies back to Colorado. Danny starts calling out [...] "redrum" [...] and goes into a trance, referring to himself as [...] "Tony".|$|E

60|$|Noah Claypole {{ran along}} the streets at his swiftest pace, and paused not once for breath, {{until he reached the}} workhouse-gate.

60|$|Barney {{could not}} but {{smile at the}} old fellow's {{remarkable}} logic. <b>He</b> <b>saw</b> that <b>nothing</b> short of a miracle would ever convince Joseph {{that he was not}} the real monarch, and so, as matters of greater importance were to the fore, he would have allowed the subject to drop had not the man attempted to recall to the impoverished memory of his king a recollection of the historic and venerated relic of the dead monarchs of Lutha.|$|R
60|$|We {{looked at}} the picture which <b>he</b> presented. I <b>saw</b> <b>nothing</b> in it of an {{extraordinary}} character, but its effect upon Bedloe was prodigious.

At least this was my thought as I regarded it.|$|R
