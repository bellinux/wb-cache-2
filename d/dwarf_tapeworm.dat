He continued to make great impacts on the study of Anguillula intestinalis, filarial worms, Trichocephalus dispar, and Bilharzia. He was the first to show that the human <b>dwarf</b> <b>tapeworm</b> Taenia nana is able to go through its entire life cycle in one animal, without the need of an intermediate host, a notion that had long been rejected. He was also the first to show that the flea Pulex serraticeps is the intermediate host of feline tapeworm Taenia elliptica. Thus he proposed that swallowing of infected fleas (for example, with milk) might be the reason for taeniasis in children. In 1879 he published a work on the life cycle of Strongyloides stercoralis, and erected the genus Strongyloides. In 1890 he, with Salvatore Calandruccio, described Dipetalonema reconditum, a non-pathogenic filarial worm of dogs, and showed that the parasite completed its development in human fleas, Pulex irritans.|$|E

50|$|The <b>dwarf</b> <b>tapeworm,</b> {{like all}} other tapeworms, lacks a {{digestive}} system and feeds by absorption on nutrients in the intestinal lumen.

When it becomes an adult, it attaches to the intestinal walls with its suckers and toothed rostellum and has its segments reaching out into the intestinal space to absorb food.|$|E

50|$|While {{the latter}} four species may be {{considered}} to be mutualists - providing benefit to their host without causing longterm harm - there are other helminth species that have demonstrated therapeutic effects but which also have a potential to cause less desirable or even harmful effects and therefore do not share the ideal characteristics for a therapeutic helminth. These include Ascaris lumbricoides, commonly known as human giant roundworm; Strongyloides stercoralis, commonly known as human roundworm; Enterobius vermicularis, commonly known as pinworm or threadworm; and Hymenolepis nana, also known as <b>dwarf</b> <b>tapeworm.</b>|$|E
50|$|H. nana, {{like all}} tapeworms, {{contains}} {{both male and}} female reproductive structures in each proglottid. This means that the <b>dwarf</b> <b>tapeworm,</b> like other tapeworms is hermaphroditic. Each segment contains three testes and a single ovary. When a proglottid becomes old and unable to absorb any more nutrition, it is released and is passed through the host's digestive tract. This gravid proglottid contains the fertilized eggs, which are sometimes expelled with the feces. However, most of the time, the egg may also settle in the microvilli of the small intestine, hatch, and the larvae can develop to sexual maturity without ever leaving the host.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the most}} common {{tapeworms}} in humans are the pork tapeworm (T. solium), the beef tapeworm (T. saginata), the fish tapeworm (Diphyllobothrium spp.), and the <b>dwarf</b> <b>tapeworm</b> (Hymenolepis spp.). Infections involving the pork and beef tapeworms are also called taeniasis. Tapeworms of the genus Echinococcus infect and cause the most harm to intermediate hosts such as sheep and cattle. Infection {{with this type of}} tapeworm is referred to as Echinococcosis or hydatid disease. Symptoms vary widely, as do treatment options, and these issues are discussed in detail in the individual articles on each worm. With a few notable exceptions like the fish tapeworm, most cestodes that infect humans and livestock are cyclophyllids, and can be identified as such by the presence of four suckers on their scolex or head.|$|E
50|$|Tapeworm {{infection}} {{can also}} be caused by eating raw or undercooked meat from an animal that has the larvae of the tapeworm, grouped in cysts (coenuri) in its muscle tissue. Once ingested, the larvae then develop into adult tapeworms in the intestines. Adult tapeworms can measure up to 55 ft long and can survive as long as 25 years. Some tapeworms attach themselves to {{the walls of the}} intestine, where they cause irritation or mild inflammation, while others may pass through to the stool and exit the body. Unlike other tapeworms, the <b>dwarf</b> <b>tapeworm</b> can complete its entire life cycle — egg to larva to adult tapeworm — in one host. This is the most common tapeworm infection in the world and can be transmitted between humans. Even while being treated for certain tapeworm infections, reinfection can result from ingesting tapeworm eggs shed by the adult worm into the stool, as a result of insufficient personal hygiene.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND:Intestinal worm (helminth) infections {{occur in}} a large {{proportion}} of the world 2 ̆ 7 s population, often constituting public health problems, and are occasionally encountered by practitioners in urban Australia. Prevalence levels in some remote Australian Aboriginal communities compare with those in developing countries. OBJECTIVE: To provide general practitioners with a brief outline of the most common human intestinal helminthiases, their usual clinical presentations and how they are diagnosed and managed. DISCUSSION: The pinworm, Enteroblus vermicularis, occurs in all populations, and is the most common species of nematode encountered in suburbia. Eradication is impossible, but its numbers can be kept low in those children who seem predisposed to heavy, symptomatic infections. The other nematodes are prevalent in some remote Australian Aboriginal communities, and are encountered occasionally in travellers from overseas. These infections are often asymptomatic, they cannot spread directly to other people and so do not pose any public health threat to the general community under suburban living conditions. The tapeworms are encountered even less frequently, except for Hymenolepis, the <b>dwarf</b> <b>tapeworm,</b> which is prevalent in some Aboriginal communities...|$|E
40|$|Amongst the {{intestinal}} infestations prevalent in Mauritius, cases of Hymenolepis nana, {{commonly known as}} the <b>dwarf</b> <b>tapeworm,</b> have been reported to occur in children. In an effort to understand the host-parasite interaction to acquired immunity to H. nana infection, studies were conducted to investigate the types of immune responses elicited by 5 - 10 week-old male mice repeatedly infected with low-dose level of H. nana eggs. The results revealed that the immunized host is capable of mounting a measurable immune response attributable to the cumulative antigenic stimulation which sensitized the immunocompetent cells. It is noteworthy that the elimination of challenge infection occurred to an equal extent in all the immunized groups, regardless of the size of immunisation. The failure of the challenge oncospheres to penetrate {{the intestinal}} mucosa of immunized hosts might be a result of the local hypersensitivity reaction occurring in situ due to {{the increase in the number}} of eosinophils. Moreover, the role of lymphocytes may be related to some immune-complex reactions and necessitates further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Hymenolepis nana, the <b>dwarf</b> <b>tapeworm,</b> is {{a common}} {{intestinal}} infection of children worldwide. We evaluated infection and risk factor data that were previously collected from 14, 761 children aged 2 - 15 years during a large-scale program in northern Peru. We found that 1, 124 of 14, 761 children (7. 61 %) had H. nana infection, a likely underestimate given that only a single stool sample was examined by microscopy for diagnosis. The strongest association with infection was lack of adequate water (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR] 2. 22, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 82 - 2. 48) and sanitation infrastructure in the house (aPR 1. 94, 95 % CI 1. 64 - 2. 29). One quarter of those tested {{did not have a}} bathroom or latrine at home, which doubled their likelihood of infection. Similarly, one quarter did not have piped public water to the house, which also increased the likelihood of infection. Continued efforts to improve access to basic water and sanitation services will likely reduce the burden of infection in children for this and other intestinal infections...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{present study}} was {{undertaken}} {{for the detection of}} Echinococcus granulosus specific antibodies in dogs by indirect-ezyme linked immunosorbent assay. Two different antigens viz., somatic and excretory secretory (E/S) antigens were prepared from E. granulosus adult worm. Totally 250 field dog serum samples were examined for the detection of anti-E. granulosus antibodies using somatic and excretory secretory antigens of E. granulosus. The specific antibodies of E. granulosus to somatic and excretory secretory antigen were detected in 62 (24. 8 per cent) and 81 (32. 4 per cent) dog serum samples by indirect ELISA. The sensitivity and specificity of indirect ELISA with somatic antigen was found to be 100 and 71. 60 per cent respectively. However the sensitivity and specificity of indirect ELISA with excretory secretory antigen was found to be 100 and 79. 20 per cent. It was concluded that the indirect-ELISA can be effectively used for specific detection of Echinococcus granulosus infection in dogs and can be used to ascertain the actual status of the E. granulosus infection in dogs in an endemic area.

40|$|Anti-parasite {{antibody}} {{responses were}} compared among several strains of mice experimentally {{infected with the}} <b>dwarf</b> <b>tapeworm,</b> Hymenolepis nana. The antibody titres were highly variable among the mouse strains in addition to variation in worm fecundity and longevity. The influence of the thymus on both infection and anti-parasite antibody production (especially of IgE isotype) was studied {{by the use of}} congenitally athymic (nu/nu) nude and their phenotypically normal (nu/+) CD- 1 (ICR) mice infected with H. nana. All nude (nu/nu) mice harboured fully mature 70 day old adult tapeworms of the first generation derived from eggs initially given on day 0. In addition, they contained (a) younger second generation adults derived from autoinfection and present in the intestinal lumen, (b) a number of abnormally large (about 1 - 2 mm in diameter) balloon like, fluid filled cysticercoids in not only the intestinal tissue but also parenteral tissues such as the mesenteric lymph nodes, liver and lung, and (c) normal cysticercoids derived from challenging eggs in the intestinal tissue. Infected nude mice produced no antibodies detectable by PCA (IgE) and double diffusion (IgG) tests. In contrast, normal (nu/+) mice and nude mice reconstituted with thymocytes expelled almost all luminal adults of the primary infection by day 70 and produced antibodies to extracts of adult H. nana. Neither autoinfection nor reinfection following egg challenge occurred in any of these normal (nu/+) and reconstituted nude mice. Therefore, acquired immune responses against H. nana (as assessed by resistance not only to the tissue phase measured by the failure of tissue cysticercoid recovery from egg challenge, but also to the lumen phase assessed by the failure of autoinfection adult recovery and 'worm expulsion' of the initially established adults) are all thymus-dependent in mice. The antibody responses examined are also thymus-dependent...|$|E
