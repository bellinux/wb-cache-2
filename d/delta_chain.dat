40|$|A {{patient with}} {{multiple}} myeloma (MM), who initially {{presented with a}} predominant IgG lambda and a minor IgD lambda paraprotein pattern, is described. After chemotherapy, levels of the IgD lambda protein increased and the IgG lambda levels decreased. The following results were obtained when serum IgD was predominant. In the bone marrow, there were three plasma cell populations: a major one containing only <b>delta</b> <b>chains,</b> a minor one containing only gamma chains, and another minor one containing both <b>delta</b> and gamma <b>chains.</b> All these plasma cell populations contained lambda chains. Stimulation of circulating mononuclear cells with pokeweed mitogen (PWM) achieved differentiation of circulating B lymphocytes into plasma cells: 30 % with only cytoplasmic <b>delta</b> lambda <b>chains</b> and 10 % with only cytoplasmic gamma lambda chains. These IgG-containing plasma cells showed cytoplasmic reactivity with rabbit antiserum raised against monoclonal IgD which was shown to contain specificities recognizing both <b>delta</b> <b>chains</b> and idiotypic determinants present in both serum IgD lambda and IgG lambda. Circulating B lymphocytes were 'monoclonal': almost all expressed surface <b>delta</b> lambda <b>chains,</b> and {{a small proportion of}} them expressed both delta gamma and lambda chains. High levels of IgD were detected in the supernatants of all cultures, but high concentrations of IgG were only detected in those from PWM-stimulated cultures with very low levels of IgM and IgA. These findings suggest that plasma cells producing either IgD or IgG were derived from a common B-cell clone.

50|$|TCRs {{have two}} parts, usually an alpha and a beta chain. (Some TCRs have a gamma and a <b>delta</b> <b>chain.)</b> Hematopoietic stem {{cells in the}} bone marrow migrate into the thymus, where they undergo VDJ {{recombination}} of their beta-chain TCR DNA to form a developmental form of the TCR protein, known as pre-TCR. If that rearrangement is successful, the cells then rearrange their alpha-chain TCR DNA to create a functional alpha-beta TCR complex. This highly-variable genetic rearrangement product in the TCR genes helps create millions of different T cells with different TCRs, helping the body's immune system respond to virtually any protein of an invader. The vast majority of T cells express alpha-beta TCRs (αβ T cells), but some T cells in epithelial tissues (like the gut) express gamma-delta TCRs (γδ T cells), which recognize non-protein antigens.|$|E

The alpha chain has an extremely long N-terminal extension of 20 residues that may form a 'pre-A helix', and this makes the alpha chain the longest known globin. B. lima alpha and beta chains show about 50 % sequence identity with the alpha and beta chains, respectively, of tetrameric haemoglobin from a related clam, Anadara trapezia. The B. lima homodimeric <b>delta</b> <b>chain</b> shows 71 - 74 % identity with each of the two domains of the 2 D chain, but only 39 % identity with the homodimeric gamma chain of Anadara. In addition, the alignment of amino acid sequences of the <b>delta</b> <b>chain</b> and the two domains of the 2 D chain revealed that the <b>delta</b> <b>chain</b> lacks one amino acid (Lys) at the C-terminus, suggesting that the C-terminal Lys (codon AAA or AAG) of the two domains of 2 D chain could result from the stop codon TAA in the <b>delta</b> <b>chain</b> by nucleotide substitutions. These results, together with the fact that the delta and 2 D chains form a polymeric haemoglobin, indicates that the <b>delta</b> <b>chain</b> is the ancestral single-domain globin for the 2 D globin.

In all cases studied the translocation splits the TCR <b>delta</b> <b>chain</b> locus. Somatic cell hybrids containing the human 10 q+ chromosome resulting from the translocation retain the human terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase gene mapped at 10 q 23 -q 24 and the diversity and joining, D delta 2 -J delta 1, regions of the TCR <b>delta</b> <b>chain,</b> but not the V alpha region (variable region of the TCR alpha chain), demonstrating that the split occurred within the V alpha-D delta 2 region.

40|$|Structural {{differences}} between the heavy chain of membrane IgD (delta m) and the heavy chain of secreted IgD (delta s) were investigated by using a human lymphoblastoid cell line that expresses idiotypically identical IgM and IgD. In a wheat germ cell-free system, mRNA from this cell line was shown to encode two distinct <b>delta</b> <b>chains</b> that differed in molecular weight. When translated in vitro {{in the presence of}} dog pancreatic microsomal membranes or when synthesized in vivo, these two <b>delta</b> <b>chains</b> were processed to four discrete glycosylated forms, all of which shared idiotypic determinants, C region determinants, and light chain linkage. As shown by digestion with endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H, these four delta forms represent two <b>delta</b> polypeptide <b>chains</b> that are differentially N-glycosylated. Pulse-chase experiments demonstrated that, after endo-beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase H treatment, delta m has a higher molecular weight than delta s. After integration into dog pancreatic microsomal membranes in vitro, delta m was found not to have a large cytoplasmic domain exposed to proteolytic digestion. The finding that delta m and delta s differ in primary structure is analogous to previous work with the corresponding heavy chains of IgM (mu m and mu s) from the same cell line. Thus, this cell line produces four Ig heavy chains (mu m, mu s, delta m, and delta s), with the same idiotype.

40|$|T {{cells can}} be divided into two groups {{on the basis of the}} {{expression}} of either alpha beta or gamma delta T-cell receptors (TCRs). Because the TCR <b>delta</b> <b>chain</b> locus lies within the larger TCR alpha chain locus, control of the utilization of these two receptors is important in T-cell development, specifically for determination of T-cell type: rearrangement of the alpha locus results in deletion of the delta coding segments and commitment to the alpha beta lineage. In the developing thymus, a relative site-specific recombination occurs by which the TCR <b>delta</b> <b>chain</b> gene segments are deleted. This deletion removes all D delta, J delta, and C delta genes and occurs on both alleles. This delta deletional mechanism is evolutionarily conserved between mice and humans. Transgenic mice which contain the human delta deleting elements and as much internal TCR <b>delta</b> <b>chain</b> coding sequence as possible without allowing the formation of a complete <b>delta</b> <b>chain</b> gene were developed. Several transgenic lines showing recombinations between deleting elements within the transgene were developed. These lines demonstrate that utilization of the delta deleting elements occurs in alpha beta T cells of the spleen and thymus. These recombinations are rare in the gamma delta population, indicating that the machinery for utilization of delta deleting elements is functional in alpha beta T cells but absent in gamma delta T cells. Furthermore, a discrete population of early thymocytes containing delta deleting element recombinations but not V alpha-to-J alpha rearrangements has been identified. These data are consistent with a model in which delta deletion contributes to the implementation of a signal by which the TCR alpha chain locus is rearranged and expressed and thus becomes an alpha beta T cell...|$|E

One of these equilibrated at 38. 5 % (wt/wt) sucrose, as did AcChoR-rich membranes from adult fish; the other equilibrated at 36. 8 % sucrose. AcChoR purified from these light membrane fractions gave the same subunit profile as adult AcChoR (after {{polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis}} {{in the presence of}} sodium dodecyl sulfate) but was more susceptible to heat inactivation and focused at an isoelectric point more alkaline by 0. 1 pH unit. Treatment of adult AcChoR with Escherichia coli alkaline phosphatase decreased its thermal stability and shifted its isoelectric point towards alkaline pH. However, identical treatment did not affect AcChoR purified from neonatal light membrane fractions. The gamma and <b>delta</b> <b>chains</b> of AcChoR can be phosphorylated in vitro by endogenous protein kinases, which copurify with AcChoR-rich membranes. Treatment of AcChoR from neonatal light membranes by E. coli alkaline phosphatase enhanced the phosphorylation of the gamma and <b>delta</b> <b>chains</b> but did so to a smaller extent than in the case of adult AcChoR.

40|$|We have {{determined}} the {{amino acid sequence}} of the variable (V) region of the delta heavy (H) chain of human IgD isolated from the plasma of myeloma patient WAH. This V region is unusual in its amino end group (arginine) and in its length (129 residues). The length is due to 10 insertions in the third complementarity-determining region (CDR 3). A computer search showed that no reported CDR 3 -joining region (-JH) sequences are identical and that {{they appear to be}} unrelated to the constant (C) region sequences of immunoglobulins. The V region sequence together with our previous results for the C region give the complete sequence of the human <b>delta</b> <b>chain</b> WAH, which has 512 amino acid residues and a Mr congruent to 65, 000.

Similar results were obtained from adult CBA/N mice whose spleens contain a large fraction of cells expressing low levels of IgD. On the other hand, the relative steady state level of mRNA in neonatal lymphocytes is approximately half of that in adults, suggesting that there may be differences in the processing or stability of the nascent transcript.
