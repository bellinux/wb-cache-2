40|$|Purpose of the Study: Trauma {{patients}} can exhibit the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) without evidence of infection. SIRS from infection {{has been associated}} with <b>hypoadrenalism.</b> We hypothesized that <b>hypoadrenalism</b> can accompany SIRS from trauma without infection. To investigate this further, we performed a retrospective study of trauma patients admitted to the ICU at our rural academic level 1 trauma center from October 2003 - June 2005, with measurement of blood cortisol in the first 7 days after injury (N= 33). We determined the incidence of <b>hypoadrenalism</b> based on serum cortisol levels and performed a univariate analysis to delineate factors associated with <b>hypoadrenalism.</b> Significant Findings: Twelve of 33 (36. 6 %) were diagnosed with <b>hypoadrenalism</b> on mean ICU day 2. 8. SIRS was documented in 92 % of hypoadrenal patients vs. 52 % of patients without <b>hypoadrenalism</b> (p= 0. 021). No patient had evidence of invasive infection. Younger age and higher ISS were also associated with <b>hypoadrenalism.</b> There were no gender differences identified, although most patients in the study were male. There was a trend toward higher etomidate use in the hypoadrenal group, although this was not statistically significant. Conclusions: Trauma patients who demonstrate SIRS early in their ICU course may exhibit <b>hypoadrenalism</b> without infection. Younger age and higher ISS also appear to be associated with this alteration. Further study is needed to determine the true incidence of this condition, and to better delineate which trauma patients are most susceptible...|$|E
40|$|SETTING: In the {{developing}} world, early mortality within 1 month of commencing tuberculosis (TB) treatment is high, particularly with {{human immunodeficiency virus}} (HIV) co-infection. In Malawi, 40 % of those who die {{do so in the}} first month of treatment. Reasons remain unclear and may include delayed diagnosis, opportunistic infections, immune restoration inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) or malnutrition. One possible contributing factor is underlying <b>hypoadrenalism</b> associated with TB-HIV, exacerbated by rifampicin (RMP) induction of P 450 and glucocorticoid metabolism. OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of <b>hypoadrenalism</b> in TB patients before and after commencement of TB treatment, and relationship with early mortality. DESIGN: Prospective descriptive study assessing <b>hypoadrenalism</b> before and after anti-tuberculosis treatment, HIV status and outcome up to 3 months post-treatment. RESULTS: Of 51 patients enrolled, 29 (56. 9 %) were female (median age 32 years, range 18 - 62). Of 43 patients HIV-tested, 38 (88. 3 %) were HIV-positive and 15. 7 % died within the first month. At 3 months, 11 (21. 6 %) were known to have died. Adequate cortisol levels were found in 49 / 51 (95. 9 %) before commencing RMP. Neither of the two with reduced response died. All 34 patients revealed adequate cortisol responses at 2 weeks. CONCLUSION: No evidence of <b>hypoadrenalism</b> was found in this first study to assess adrenal function and outcome of anti-tuberculosis treatment...|$|E

The possibility of true <b>hypoadrenalism</b> is only occasionally considered, and little data exists on the frequency with which it coexists with rheumatic disease. Random serum cortisol may be requested by clinicians to help exclude <b>hypoadrenalism</b> as a factor in fatigue. We undertook a survey to assess how frequently this test was of clinical relevance, what was done in {{patients with}} low results, and which patients were most likely to have true adrenal failure. All random cortisol assays requested by the members of a rheumatological team over one year were identified and the notes examined retrospectively. The indication for the request, the result, the ultimate clinical diagnosis and all prior diagnoses were recorded. Where further investigations were undertaken, these too were noted. The results were compared to those in an age and gender matched population of patients with general medical conditions (excluding endocrine disorders) for whom cortisol assays had also been requested. Random cortisol was requested by a team of four consultants in 74 patients with a variety of rheumatic disorders over 12 months, usually because of unexplained fatigue. Among the control group of 75 medical patients, the commonest reasons for requesting cortisol assay were fatigue, low sodium and unexplained anaemia. Mean cortisol levels were significantly higher in medical patients (512 nmol/L) than those with rheumatic disease (351 nmol/L) [P= 0. 04]. The results were low (< 200 nmol/L) in 14 rheumatic patients and 7 medical patients. Among these 21 individuals, synacthen tests were performed in 16 and were indicative of <b>hypoadrenalism</b> in 6 cases. Further investigations revealed primary <b>hypoadrenalism</b> in 3 patients, with tertiary adrenal suppression from oral steroids in three others. All six of these patients had underlying rheumatic disorders, usually RA (3) or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (2). None of the medical patients had an abnormal synacthen test. Fatigue in patients with rheumatic disease may be a presenting feature of <b>hypoadrenalism.</b> Although adrenal failure is rare in medical patients with anaemia, hyponatraemia or fatigue, patients with rheumatic disease and unexplained fatigue merit a random cortisol. If this is low, synacthen testing may be appropriate. Steroids should not be commenced empirically in such patients until <b>hypoadrenalism</b> has been excluded, as a significant minority will have genuine primary adrenal failure, usually due to autoimmune disease...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} the assay-dependence of cortisol measurement and the potential impact this could have on {{the interpretation of the}} Synacthen test. Prompted by clinical concern that <b>hypoadrenalism</b> was being over-diagnosed, this work set out to determine assay-specific serum cortisol and salivary cortisol responses to Synacthen stimulation in healthy volunteers. It begins with an overview of cortisol assays in serum and saliva from their inception 50 years ago to the present day; highlighting the limitations of serum total cortisol as an analyte and immunoassays for its measurement and exploring salivary free cortisol, calculated free cortisol and mass spectrometry as alternatives. The study itself recruited a total of 206 healthy volunteers and patients to undergo serum and salivary Synacthen tests. Serum cortisol was measured by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and by 5 contemporary immunoassays, salivary cortisol was measured by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and serum free cortisol was calculated using the Coolens’ equation and the free cortisol index. The results in serum confirmed the assay-dependence of immunoassay cortisol measurement, established valid reference ranges for each of the assays studied, proposed diagnostic cut-off concentrations and evaluated their performance in patients with suspected <b>hypoadrenalism.</b> The salivary results were used to establish adult reference ranges specific to the in-house LC-MS/MS assay used and subsequently demonstrated comparable performance in patients with suspected <b>hypoadrenalism</b> to the serum Synacthen test. Calculated serum free cortisol performed poorly compared to serum total and salivary cortisol and was subject to error because of difficulty measuring cortisol binding globulin (CBG). Comparisons between the three measures in patients with altered serum protein concentrations showed that, of the three, only salivary cortisol had the potential to accurately diagnose <b>hypoadrenalism</b> using a single cut-off; although confirmation of this finding is needed in a larger patient group...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Lung {{cancer is}} the leading cause of cancer {{mortality}} in most countries. The adrenal glands are common sites of metastatic lung cancer as approximately 40 % of subjects with stage 4 bronchogenic carcinoma have adrenal metastases. The prevalence of biochemical <b>hypoadrenalism</b> is, however, remarkably poorly documented. Objectives. Our study aimed to determine the prevalence of primary <b>hypoadrenalism,</b> as defined by a subnormal cortisol response to the 250 µg adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test, in patients with stage 3 and 4 lung cancer. Methods. Thirty patients with stage 3 and 4 bronchogenic carcinoma were prospectively recruited from the bronchus clinic. Demographic data and electrolytes were recorded and each patient had a 250 µg ACTH stimulation test to determine the prevalence of overt adrenal insufficiency, defined as a + 30 minute cortisol of less than 550 nmol/l. Results. The median age and quartile deviation was 62 (10) years and the median basal cortisol was 429. 5 (321) nmol/l. The median peak cortisol was 828. 5 (342) nmol/l (range 536 - 1 675 nmol/l). Twenty-eight patients (93. 3 %) had an appropriate rise of cortisol to greater than 550 nmol/l following 250 µg ACTH stimulation. Two patients (6. 7 %) had mild primary adrenal failure with a peak cortisol between 500 and 550 nmol/l associated with a raised plasma ACTH concentration (131. 4 and 10. 5 pmol/l, normal 2. 2 - 10 pmol/l). Twenty-eight patients (92. 9 %) were normonatraemic, while the two hyponatraemic patients had biochemical evidence of the syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion. Conclusion. In conclusion, despite evidence that the adrenal glands of patients with disseminated bronchogenic carcinoma are frequently affected by metastatic disease, biochemical evidence of clinically significant <b>hypoadrenalism</b> is relatively uncommon and is not accurately predicted by electrolyte abnormalities...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Traditional neurosurgical {{practice}} {{calls for}} administration of peri-operative stress-dose steroids for sellar-suprasellar masses undergoing operative treatment. This practice is considered critical to prevent peri-operative complications associated with <b>hypoadrenalism,</b> such as hypotension and circulatory collapse. However, stress-dose steroids complicate {{the management of}} these patients. It has been our routine practice to use stress steroids during surgery only if the patient has clinical or biochemical evidence of hypocortisolism pre-operatively. We wanted {{to be certain that}} this practice was safe. Methods: We present our retrospective analysis from a consecutive series of 114 operations in 109 patients with sellar and/or suprasellar tumors, the majority of whom were managed without empirical stress-dose steroid coverage. Only patients who were hypoadrenal pre-operatively or who had suffered apoplexy were given stress dose coverage during surgery. We screened for biochemical evidence of <b>hypoadrenalism</b> as a result of surgery by measuring immediate post-operative AM serum cortisol levels. Results: There were no adverse events related to the selective use of cortisol replacement in this patient population. Conclusions: Our experience demonstrates that selective use of corticosteroid replacement is safe; it simplifies the management of the patients, and has advantages over empiric dogmatic steroid coverage...|$|E

40|$|Congenital {{deficiency}} of proopiomelanocortin (POMC) {{results in a}} syndrome of <b>hypoadrenalism,</b> severe obesity, and altered skin and hair pigmentation. The concept that subtle variation in POMC expression and/or function might contribute to common obesity is suggested by studies reporting linkage of obesity-related traits to a locus on chromosome 2 p 22 encompassing the POMC gene. We identified a novel homozygous frameshift (C 6906 del) mutation in POMC in a child of Turkish origin with severe obesity and <b>hypoadrenalism.</b> This mutation would be predicted {{to lead to the}} loss of all POMC-derived peptides. The availability of a large extended pedigree provided the opportunity to address whether loss of one copy of the POMC gene was sufficient to alter obesity risk. Twelve relatives were heterozygous for the mutation and 7 were wild type. Of the heterozygotes, 11 of 12 heterozygotes were obese or overweight compared with only 1 of 7 of the wild-type relatives. The mean BMI SD score was 1. 7 1 0. 5 in heterozygotes and 0. 4 1 0. 4 in the wild-type relatives. Parametric linkage analysis of the trait "overweight" provided statistically significant evidence of linkage with this locus, with a maximum "location score" (comparable with multipoint logarithm of odds scores) of 3. 191. We conclude that loss of one copy of the POMC gene predisposes to obesity in humans. Thus, genetic variants having relatively subtle effects on POMC expression and function could influence susceptibility to obesity...|$|E

40|$|We have {{previously}} described the only reported case of human proprotein convertase 1 (PC 1) deficiency, in a female (Subject A) with obesity, hypogonadism, <b>hypoadrenalism,</b> and reactive hypoglycemia. We now report {{the second case}} of human PC 1 deficiency (Subject B), also due to compound heterozygosity for novel missense and nonsense mutations. While both subjects shared the phenotypes of obesity <b>hypoadrenalism,</b> reactive hypoglycemia, and elevated circulating levels of certain prohormones, the clinical presentation of Subject B was dominated by severe refractory neonatal diarrhea, malabsorptive in type. Subsequent investigation of Subject A revealed marked small-intestinal absorptive dysfunction, which was not previously clinically suspected. We postulate that PC 1, presumably in the enteroendocrine cells, {{is essential for the}} normal absorptive function of the human small intestine. The differences in the nature and severity of presentation between the two cases cannot readily be explained on the basis of allelic heterogeneity, as the nonsense and missense mutations from both subjects had comparably severe effects on the catalytic activity of PC 1. Despite Subject A's negligible PC 1 activity, some mature ACTH and glucagon-like peptide 1 (7 - 36 amide) were detectable in her plasma, suggesting that the production of these hormones, at least in humans, does not have an absolute dependence on PC 1. The presence of severe obesity and the absence of growth retardation in both subjects contrast markedly with the phenotype of mice lacking PC 1 and suggest that the precise physiological repertoire of this enzyme may vary between mammalian species. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Hypopituitarism {{represents}} {{the consequence of}} many conditions, in both the adult and child population.

The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate pituitary function in particular GH deficiency (GHD) in patients submitted to neurosurgery for benign tumors of the central nervous system (CNS) not involving hypothalamic-pituitary region. We observed 37 patients with benign brain tumors [13 males, 24 females, age: 54. 6 +/- 13. 9 yr; body mass index (BMI) : 25. 1 +/- 4. 0 kg/m 2] performing a basic evaluation of the pituitary function and a dynamic test of the GH/IGF-I axis [GHRH (1 microg/kg iv) +arginine (0. 5 g/kg iv) test] for 3 and 12 months after the neurosurgical treatment. Some degree of hypopituitarism was shown in 16 patients (43. 2 %) at the 3 -months follow-up. Hypogonadism was present in 4 patients, <b>hypoadrenalism</b> in another 4 and hypothyroidism in 2. Two patients showed mild hyperprolactinemia and no patients had diabetes insipidus. Seven patients (18. 9 %) were GH deficient (peak GH < 16. 5 microg/dl). At 12 months retesting, some degree of hypopituitarism was confirmed in 8 patients, hypogonadism in 2 and hypothyroidism in one; no patients showed <b>hypoadrenalism</b> and GHD was present in 5. This data suggests that hypopituitarism of various degree may develop in patients who are submitted to neurosurgery for primary brain tumors, even far from hypothalamic-pituitary region...|$|E

The authors' {{objective was to}} prospectively study adrenal function in a case series of hemodynamically unstable (high-risk) patients from a large, urban ED over a 12 -month period. Methods: In a prospective manner, critically ill adult patients presenting to the ED were enrolled when presenting with a mean arterial blood pressure # 60 mm Hg requiring vasopressor therapy {{for more than one}} hour after receiving ¯uid resusci-tation (central venous pressure of 12 ± 15 mm Hg or a minimum of 40 mL/kg of crystalloid). Patients were excluded if presenting with hemorrhage, trauma, or AIDS, or if steroids were used within the previous six months. An adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation test was performed and serum cortisol was measured. Treatment for adrenal insuf®ciency was not instituted. Results: A total of 57 consecutive patients were studied. Of these, eight (14 %) had base-line serum cortisol concentrations of < 20 mg/dL (< 552 nmol/L), which was considered adrenal insuf®ciency (AI). Three additional patients (5 %) had subnormal 60 -minute post-ACTH-stimulation cortisol responses (< 30 mg/dL) and a delta cortisol # 9 mg/dL, which is the difference between the baseline and 60 -minute levels. This is functional <b>hypoadrenalism</b> (FH). There were no laboratory abnormalities that distinguished patients with AI or FH from those with preserved ad-renal function (PAF). Rates of survival to discharge did not differ between the AI group (7 of 8) and PAF patients (21 of 46; p = 0. 052). Conclusions: Adrenal dysfunction is common in high-risk ED patients. Overall, it has a frequency of 19 % among a homoge-neous population of hemodynamically unstable va-sopressor-dependent patients. The effect of physio-logic glucocorticoid replacement in this setting remains to be determined.

40|$|Mean plasma {{cortisol}} 4 to 6 {{hours after}} 1 mg Synacthen Depot in normal subjects, simple goiter and hypothyroidism {{were not significantly}} different. On the contrary after stimulation cortisol levels in untreated hyperthyroidism were significantly below than those of normals and significantly {{higher than those of}} primary and secondary <b>hypoadrenalism.</b> After several injections of Synacthen Depot 6 cases of hyperthyroidism showed reduced adrenal reserve. The study of adrenal reserve in hyperthyroidism after 1 to 14 months of methimazole shows a tendency of the adrenal reserve to improve with time. These observations led the author to the belief that the reduced adrenal reserve in this situation must be due mainly to a direct effect of thyroid hormones upon the adrenal cortex. There has been much discussion about the action of thyroid hormones upon the adrenal cortex...|$|E
