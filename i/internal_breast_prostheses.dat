50|$|<b>Breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> are <b>breast</b> forms {{intended}} to simulate breasts. There {{are a number}} of materials and designs; although, the most common construction is silicone gel in a plastic skin. Off-the shelf <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> come in a range of shapes and sizes, while customised <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> are moulded to fit an individual's chest by taking an impression of both breasts and sculpting a mirror image. Pals Breast Forms consist of a non silicone gel which can be trimmed to fit with scissors, then sent back for customization. Fabrication of customised prostheses is typically done by an anaplastologist who makes somato prostheses. The areola and nipple may be replicated by being moulded into the breast form or a separate nipple prosthesis may be attached to the <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Both custom made and off-the shelf <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> come in varieties that are designed to either be held in a pocket in a specially designed mastectomy bra or attached to the skin and worn with a standard bra.|$|R

40|$|Introduction. Recent papers {{indicate}} that one-side mastectomy can produce deleterious {{effects on the}} posture and musculoskeletal system. This {{study was conducted to}} better understand the underlying mechanisms involved in trunk motion in external prosthesis users. Objective. The aim was to evaluate the changes in surface electromyographic (SEMG) activity of the erector spinae muscles (ES) in postmastectomy women with and without <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> during functional body movement tests. Methods. In 51 one-side postmastectomy women the SEMG muscle activity of bilateral ES was measured during symmetrical and asymmetrical dynamic activities in a counterbalanced manner with different weights of the <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Range-of-motion measurements were taken for forward bending, backward bending, lateral bending, and rotation. Results. The mean level of the ES activity in the lumbar region was not affected by the weight of the external <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis</b> during most of the functional body tests (P> 0. 05). The activity of ES during functional body tests with and without different external <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> did not differ between {{the two sides of the}} trunk (mastectomy and nonmastectomy) for most of the movement tests (P> 0. 05). Conclusion. The lumbar ES activity during functional tests is not associated with the weight of the external <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis</b> in postmastectomy women...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{experiences}} of the use of external <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> among <b>breast</b> cancer survivors in Korea. Methods: A qualitative descriptive study was conducted, using focus groups. Data were collected from breast cancer survivors who were patients of C women's hospital in Seoul, Korea. Data were analyzed using content analysis in order to identify significant themes. Results: Participants included forty breast cancer survivors who had mastectomy as a surgical treatment. Four themes emerged from the collected data were: 1) concern over the high price of external <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> 2) irregular use of external <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis,</b> 3) unsatisfied with mastectomy bra, and 4) wanting to hide or not to talk about using <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis</b> openly. Conclusion: Since most participants reported irregular use and negative experiences related to external <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis</b> or mastectomy bra use, healthcare workers should allow more time for proper fitting and counseling and consulting with breast cancer survivors. In addition, health care providers as well as family and friends should keep in mind that cancer survivors need support that can help them cope by using positive reframing. Furthermore, improvements in the coverage of costs and services are needed for these women. This would be helpful for breas...|$|R

40|$|Breast {{cancer is}} one of the most common cancers {{affecting}} women in Ireland with approximately 1, 726 women being registered with breast cancer each year (National Cancer Registry Ireland (NCRI), 2005). The majority of women with breast cancer have surgery as a form of treatment either on its own or in combination with radiotherapy, chemotherapy and/or hormone therapy (NCRI, 2005). An integral part of the recovery post surgery involves considering restorative options. For many women in Ireland this means being fitted with an external <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> Currently, there are an estimated 16, 000 women in Ireland who have undergone a mastectomy and require an external <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis.</b> The overall purpose of this research is to gain an insight into women’s experience of the provision, fitting, supply and use of external <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> in Ireland...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{determine}} whether women with silicone <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> have more rheumatic complaints than controls. METHODS [...] The study included 287 {{women who had}} silicone <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> implanted between 1978 - 90. For every patient a female control {{of the same age}} was selected who had had an aesthetic operation in the same year. A questionnaire was sent to this retrospective cohort of women with silicone <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> and controls. RESULTS [...] Questionnaires were returned by 235 cases (82 %) and 210 controls (73 %). Patients reported more symptoms arising after surgery than controls (0. 6 v 0. 3 complaints per subject, p < 0. 001). The average interval between surgery and onset of complaints was 5. 1 years for patients and 5. 9 for controls. Complaints presented by patients were: painful joints (p < 0. 005), burning eyes (p < 0. 01), and skin abnormalities (p < 0. 005). Differences in the use of antirheumatic drugs or medical consultations related to rheumatic symptoms did not reach statistical significance. Further information obtained from the patients and controls reporting rheumatic symptoms did not reveal the presence of a specific syndrome in connection with silicone materials. CONCLUSION [...] Women with silicone <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> report more rheumatic complaints after silicone implantation than controls, but {{there is no evidence of}} increased prevalence of common rheumatic diseases...|$|R

25|$|The sole {{application}} of breast augmentation mammoplasty to correct minimal breast ptosis (Grade I) usually is effected with a <b>breast</b> implant <b>prosthesis.</b> The dual {{application of}} mastopexy and of breast augmentation surgeries — as one surgical procedure — requires thorough planning, {{because of the}} required resections of the parenchymal tissues. The periareolar incision lends itself to <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis</b> implantation and to nipple-areola complex transposition, whilst maintaining the tissue viability of the nipple-areola complex.|$|R
50|$|A trans-umbilical breast {{augmentation}} is a <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis</b> insertion technique {{wherein the}} incision {{is at the}} umbilicus (navel), which dissection then tunnels superiorly, to facilitate emplacing the <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis</b> to the implant pocket without producing visible surgical scars upon the breast hemisphere; but it makes appropriate dissection and device-emplacement more technically difficult. A TUBA procedure is performed bluntly (without endoscopic assistance), and is inapplicable to emplacing (pre-filled) silicone-gel implants, because of the great potential for damaging the elastomer silicone shell of the breast-implant device during its manual insertion through the short, two-centimetre (~2.0 cm), incision at the navel, and because pre-filled silicone-gel implants are incompressible, and cannot be inserted through so small an incision.|$|R

50|$|In {{the third}} chapter, 'Breast Cancer: Power vs. Prosthesis', Lorde dwells on her {{coming to terms}} with the outcome of her mastectomy.

She explains that although it is fine for women to resort to a <b>breast</b> <b>prosthesis</b> if they wanted to, the options seems like a cover-up in a society where women are solely judged by and reduced to their looks. Lorde understands the “cosmetic” focus of the Reach for Recovery program as part of a general problem of sexism and racism.

40|$|Concerns {{have been}} raised {{recently}} regarding {{the increasing number of}} reports of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) that developed in close proximity to silicone or saline breast implants. In particular, an increased risk of anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) in patients with <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> has been proposed. We reviewed clinical and pathologic findings in 40 women who received a diagnosis of breast NHL arising in association with breast implants and of 27 patients who had a diagnosis of ALCL with breast involvement reported in the published literature. Among the 40 reported cases of prosthesis- associated breast lymphomas, 28 were anaplastic lymphoma kinase- 1 -negative (ALK- 1 -) ALCLs, whereas of 27 ALCLs in patients without implants found in the literature, only 10 were ALK- 1 -. The finding of 28 cases of breast ALK- 1 -ALCL occurring in patients with implants compared with 10 cases in women without implants is in favor of an association between silicone <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> and ALK- 1 -ALCL. Although the incidence of this type of lymphoma remains remarkably low given that <b>breast</b> <b>prostheses</b> have been widely used for decades, clinical and pathologic evidence for a causative role is becoming dramatically strong. The histologic, phenomenologic, and clinical similarities of the majority of implant-related ALK- 1 -ALCLs suggest a common mechanism, especially when compared with the counterpart of patients without implants in which very few and highly dishomogeneous cases of the same malignancy were detected. There is convincing evidence that primary implant-related ALK- 1 -ALCL represents a distinct clinicopathologic entity that has been inappropriately fitted into the category of systemic ALK- 1 -ALCL. Thus it should be recognized as a separate category and classified on its own...|$|R
