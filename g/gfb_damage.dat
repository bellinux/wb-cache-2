50|$|Diabetes {{causes a}} number of changes to the body's {{metabolism}} and blood circulation, which likely combine to produce excess reactive oxygen species (chemically reactive molecules containing oxygen). These changes damage the kidney's glomeruli (networks of tiny blood vessels), {{which leads to the}} hallmark feature of albumin in the urine (called albuminuria). As diabetic nephropathy progresses, a structure in the glomeruli known as the glomerular filtration barrier (GFB) is increasingly damaged. This barrier is composed of three layers including the fenestrated endothelium, the glomerular basement membrane, and the epithelial podocytes. The GFB is responsible for the highly selective filtration of blood entering the kidney's glomeruli and normally only allows the passage of water, small molecules, and very small proteins (albumin does not pass through the intact <b>GFB).</b> <b>Damage</b> to the glomerular basement membrane allows proteins in the blood to leak through, leading to accumulation in Bowman's space as distinct periodic-acid schiff positive nodules called Kimmelstiel-Wilson nodules.|$|E
