50|$|In theory {{the larger}} the fan {{diameter}} (the line {{from the tip of}} one <b>fanblade</b> to its opposite member) the greater the thrust. In practical applications, fan size is limited by the weight, the space available around the aircraft and by the increased drag (resistance) generated by the larger frontal area.|$|E
5000|$|The {{use of a}} DC {{license in}} Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe imposed some {{restrictions}} on the characteristic violence in Mortal Kombat games. Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe was thus restricted to a [...] "Teen" [...] rating. Therefore, various Fatalities such as Sub-Zero's [...] "Spine Rip" [...] were replaced due to their violent nature. In order to keep that rating, two of the Fatalities in Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe were censored in North America. In the United Kingdom version of Mortal Kombat vs. DC Universe, both the Joker and Deathstroke's first Fatality depict them each finishing their opponent with a gunshot to the head, both shown uncut from a distance. The North American version has the camera quickly pan toward the victor before the shot is fired, thereby cutting the victim out of the shot completely. Additionally, one of Kitana's Fatalities which involved impaling the opponent {{in the head and}} the torso with her <b>fanblades</b> was modified so that both <b>fanblades</b> impaled her opponent's chest instead.|$|R
5000|$|A wide chord engine {{addresses}} this {{by having}} fewer, wider, blades meaning a wide chord fan engine will have fewer, but more effective, <b>fanblades</b> {{compared to a}} regular jet engine. To address the weight issue, blades are often hollow and made from titanium. Finally, blades are often given a scimitar shape to achieve higher flying speeds. The Wide-Chord Swept fan blade was designed and developed at Rolls-Royce Barnoldswick in Lancashire, and is still manufactured there to this day. The process uses Superplastically formed, diffusion bonded technology to acheive the light weight, strong design.|$|R
