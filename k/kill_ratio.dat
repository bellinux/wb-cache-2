5|$|Which {{of these}} two {{policies}} was more effective was immediately clear: during Rolling Thunder the US maintained a 3.7:1 <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> over the VPAF as a whole, but the Air Force's portion of that was closer to 2:1., By 1970 the Navy's ratio had climbed to 13:1. The Air Force, however, saw its ratio stagnate and actually decrease, {{for a short time}} being less than one. More critically, in 1970 the VPAF inflicted a kill on the USAF every three times they tried, while it took six missions to do the same against the Navy, and inversely, the VPAF lost a MiG every two engagements with the Air Force, but every time they engaged the Navy.|$|E
5|$|Then, as they {{approached}} their target, the MiG-21 pilots would make a supersonic diving pass against trailing or isolated flights, so they could position themselves for a missile kill. The action of 23 August demonstrated that the North Vietnamese Air Force had successfully executed their new procedure, which was helped by more skilful ground controllers who directed the MiG fighter towards their targets. Indeed, the new procedure gave North Vietnamese MiG pilots the ingredient they needed to achieve a kill over their U.S. opponents; between August 1967 and February 1968, the North Vietnamese Air Force achieved a <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> of 1.1:1 against the USAF, {{with the loss of}} 20 aircraft for 22 victories. In the same period of time, Operation Rolling Thunder had cost the United States approximately $900million ($5,640million at 2010 prices) with the loss of more than 700 aircraft. The bombing campaign continued until 31 October 1968, when it was abandoned by the U.S. Government.|$|E
25|$|During the {{remainder}} of the Vietnam War, the Navy <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> climbed to 8.33 to 1. In contrast, the Air Force rate improved only slightly to 2.83 to 1. The reason for this difference was Top Gun. The Navy had revitalized its air combat training, while the Air Force had stayed stagnant. Most of the Navy MiG kills were by Top Gun graduates.|$|E

25|$|ROCAF General HQ was {{established}} in June 1946. From 1946 to 1948, during the Chinese Civil War, the ROCAF participated in combat against the People's Liberation Army engaging in air-to-air combat on at least eleven occasions in the areas surrounding the Taiwan Strait. The ROCAF reportedly enjoyed a 31:1 <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> against the PLA. GHQ was evacuated to Taiwan {{along with the rest}} of the ROC Government in April 1949 following the Communist victory in the Chinese Civil War. The ROCAF assisted in halting the PLA advance at the Battle of Kuningtou on Kinmen the same year.|$|E
25|$|Overall, the few Gladiators and CR.42s {{clashed with}} a {{substantial}} parity: considering all theaters, the <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> was 1.2-to-1 {{in favour of}} the former, a ratio {{similar to that of}} the BF.109 and the Spitfire in the Battle of Britain, a duel considered evenly balanced by most historians. However, the Gladiator (optimised for dogfighting) met with only little success against the relatively fast Italian bombers, shooting down only a handful of them and suffering almost as many losses in the process, which could be one of the reasons for its quick retirement from first-line duty; the CR.42 on the other hand was successful against early British bombers, shooting down a hundred of them with minimal losses.|$|E
25|$|In early June 1940, the French {{aviation}} industry {{had reached a}} considerable output, with an estimated reserve of nearly 2,000 aircraft. A chronic lack of spare parts crippled this fleet. Only 29 percent (599) of the aircraft were serviceable, of which 170 were bombers. Low serviceability meant the Germans had a clear numerical superiority in medium bomber aircraft, with six {{times as many as}} the French. Despite its disadvantages the Armée de l'Air performed far better than expected, destroying 916 enemy aircraft in air-to-air combat during the Battle of France, for a <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> of 2.35:1, with almost a third of those kills accomplished by French pilots flying the US built Curtiss Hawk 75, which accounted for 12.6 percent of the French single-seat fighter force.|$|E

The VPAF lost 54 MiGs (including 36 MiG-21s and one MiG-21US) and they claimed 90 U.S. aircraft were shot down (including 73 F-4 fighters and two spy RF-4C) ...|$|R
25|$|After the war, and to {{the present}} day, the USAF reports an F-86 Sabre <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> in excess of 10:1, with 792 MiG-15s and 108 other {{aircraft}} shot down by Sabres, and 78 Sabres lost to enemy fire. The Soviet Air Force reported some 1,100 air-to-air victories and 335 MiG combat losses, while China's People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) reported 231 combat losses, mostly MiG-15s, and 168 other aircraft lost. The KPAF reported no data, but the UN Command estimates some 200 KPAF aircraft lost in the war's first stage, and 70 additional aircraft after the Chinese intervention. The USAF disputes Soviet and Chinese claims of 650 and 211 downed F-86s, respectively. However, one source claims that the U.S. Air Force has more recently cited 224 losses (c.100 to air combat) out of 674 F-86s deployed to Korea.|$|E
25|$|U.S. Navy and Marine F6F pilots flew 66,530 combat sorties {{and claimed}} 5,163 kills (56% of all U.S. Navy/Marine air {{victories}} of the war) at a recorded cost of 270 Hellcats in aerial combat (an overall kill-to-loss ratio of 19:1 based on claimed but not confirmed kills). Claimed victories were often highly exaggerated during the war. Even so, the aircraft performed well {{against the best}} Japanese opponents with a claimed 13:1 <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> against the A6M Zero, 9.5:1 against the Nakajima Ki-84, and 3.7:1 against the Mitsubishi J2M {{during the last year}} of the war. The F6F became the prime ace-maker aircraft in the American inventory, with 305 Hellcat aces. The U.S. successes were not only attributed to superior aircraft, but also from 1942 onwards, they faced increasingly inexperienced Japanese aviators as well as having the advantage of increasing numerical superiority. In the ground attack role, Hellcats dropped 6,503tons (5,899tonnes) of bombs.|$|E
25|$|In early combat operations, the Zero {{gained a}} legendary {{reputation}} as a dogfighter, achieving an outstanding <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> of 12 to 1, but by mid-1942 a combination of new tactics {{and the introduction of}} better equipment enabled Allied pilots to engage the Zero on generally equal terms. By 1943, the Zero became less effective against newer Allied fighters because of inherent design weaknesses and the failure to develop more powerful aircraft engines. The Allied fighters gained greater firepower, armor, and speed, and approached the Zero's maneuverability, and the Mitsubishi A6M was outdated by 1944. The Zero continued to serve in a front line role {{until the end of the}} war, however, due to design delays and production difficulties of newer Japanese aircraft types. The Zero was also adapted for use in kamikaze operations during the final year of the war in the Pacific. Japan produced more Zeros than any other model of combat aircraft during the course of the war.|$|E
50|$|Soviet sources report <b>kill</b> <b>ratios</b> of 75-85% {{during the}} Soviet {{invasion}} of Afghanistan. Also a Mil demonstration in Sweden in late 1995 using a Mi-28A firing Shturm and Ataka missiles also showed good results: from a hovering helicopter, a Shturm was fired at a target 900 m away; and from level flight at 200 km/h an Ataka was fired at a target 4,700 m away. Both missiles passed within 1 m of their aiming point.|$|R

Nevertheless, Tet demonstrates how Communist strategy was focused on the key element in a People's War- the population – whether to control it or demoralize it, while American strategy focused on <b>kill</b> <b>ratios</b> and attrition.|$|R
50|$|Experts were {{surprised}} when advanced F-105s {{were shot down}} in its first encounter against the elderly but nimble MiG-17. Dogfights {{were thought to be}} obsolete in the age of missiles, but pilots now needed maneuverability. The McDonnell Douglas F-4 Phantom II was quickly tasked with protecting against MiGs, but lacked a built-in gun when missiles were still very unreliable. Air combat training schools such as TOPGUN would improve <b>kill</b> <b>ratios,</b> but combat experience started programs that would produce agile air superiority fighters with guns such as the McDonnell Douglas F-15 Eagle by the 1970s.|$|R
25|$|The Corsair was {{designed}} as a carrier-based aircraft but its difficult carrier landing performance rendered it unsuitable for Navy use until the carrier landing issues were overcome by the Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm. The Corsair thus came to and retained prominence in its area of greatest deployment: land based use by the U.S. Marines. The role of the dominant U.S. carrier based fighter {{in the second part of}} the war was thus filled by the Grumman F6F Hellcat, powered by the same Double Wasp engine first flown on the Corsair's first prototype in 1940. The Corsair served to a lesser degree in the U.S. Navy. In addition to its use by the U.S. and British, the Corsair was also used by the Royal New Zealand Air Force, the French Naval Aviation and other, smaller, air forces until the 1960s. Some Japanese pilots regarded it as the most formidable American fighter of World War II, and the U.S. Navy counted an 11:1 <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> with the F4U Corsair.|$|E
25|$|The Luftwaffe {{was now in}} an {{impossible}} position. The oil industry had to be defended, but doing so was costly. I. Jagdkorps was losing fighters {{at a rate of}} 10% per mission, while the American bomber losses were only at two percent. It was not until July 28, 1944, during an attack by the USAAF's 92nd Bomb Group on the Leipzig/Leuna synthetic fuel complex that the first direct point-defense fighter action meant specifically to defend the synthetic oil facilities of Nazi Germany began, as the Messerschmitt Me 163B Komet rocket fighters of I./JG 400 made their first operational strike against the USAAF's bomber combat boxes from JG 400's nearby base at Brandis, to little effect. By September 1944, the loss to <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> was against the Luftwaffe. With some exceptions, the loss rate for Allied formations remained under one percent, the German losses were lying between 10 and 20%. The Allied formations were 18 times larger than the Germans by this stage, which meant the respective loss ratios would indicate a higher loss for the German defenders. However, during September the actual kill count of the RLV during September 1944 was 307 shot down for 371 losses. By October 1944, serviceable aircraft amounted to just 347, excluding units on conversion training.|$|E
25|$|No. 453 Squadron {{strove to}} support Allied ground troops in Malaya by {{providing}} air cover and attacking Japanese troops and transport, but the outnumbered Allied squadrons suffered high {{losses in the}} air and on the ground. The heaviest losses came on 22 December when five Buffalos were destroyed and another four damaged, with three pilots being killed. On 24 December, with only three working aircraft remaining, No. 453 Squadron withdrew to Singapore and merged with 21 Squadron, which was brought up to strength with an allocation of replacement aircraft. The amalgamated unit continued to fight on, until late January when they were separated again. No. 21 Squadron was then sent to the Netherlands East Indies, while No. 453 continued to operate the remaining six Buffaloes. In early February, only four aircraft remained operational and they were flown to Java while the squadron's ground crew were evacuated by ship. When No. 453 Squadron arrived in Java it could not be brought up to operational readiness again due to lack of serviceable aircraft. It was ordered back to Australia, and was officially disbanded at Adelaide on 15 March 1942. In spite of many technical problems, and being outmatched by the Japanese Zero, the Buffalo squadrons claimed a 2:1 <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> against Japanese aircraft in 1941–42.|$|E

50|$|The wars {{began with}} both sides using {{propeller}} planes, such as Spitfires, Avia S-199s, and P-51s, then progressed to older jets like MiG-15s, Dassault Mysteres and Dassault Mirages. In the latter wars dogfighting ensued between modern aircraft, like F-15s and F-16s against MiG-21s and MiG-25s. Although usually outnumbered, the Israelis managed to defeat the air forces of Egypt, Jordan and Syria in dogfights, often achieving <b>kill</b> <b>ratios</b> ranging from 10:1 to over 20:1, which is usually attributed to better training of the Israeli pilots and a technological advantage.|$|R
5000|$|The MiG-23 was the Soviet Air Force's [...] "Top Gun"-equivalent aggressor {{aircraft}} {{from the}} late 1970s to the late 1980s.

Exercises showed when well-flown, a MiG-23MLD could achieve favorable <b>kill</b> <b>ratios</b> against the MiG-29 in mock combat by using hit-and-run tactics and not engaging the MiG-29s in dogfights. Usually the aggressor MiG-23MLDs had a shark mouth painted on the nose just aft of the radome, and many were piloted by Soviet-Afghan War veterans. In the late 1980s, these aggressor MiG-23s were replaced by MiG-29s, also featuring shark mouths.|$|R
25|$|From an Australian perspective, one of {{the most}} famous engagements in the war was the Battle of Long Tan which took place on 18 and 19 August 1966. During the battle a company from 6 RAR, despite being heavily outnumbered, fought off a large enemy assault of regimental strength. 18 Australians were killed and 24 wounded, while at least 245 Viet Cong were killed. It was a decisive Australian victory and is often cited as an example of the {{importance}} of combining and coordinating infantry, artillery, armour and military aviation. The battle had considerable tactical implications as well, being significant in allowing the Australians to gain dominance over Phuoc Tuy Province, and although there were other large-scale encounters in later years, 1 ATF was not fundamentally challenged again. Regardless, during February 1967 1 ATF sustained its heaviest casualties in the war to that point, losing 16 men killed and 55 wounded in a single week, the bulk of them during Operation Bribie. 1 ATF appeared to have lost the initiative and for the first time in nine months of operations the number of Australians killed in battle, or from friendly fire, mines or booby traps, had reversed the task force's <b>kill</b> <b>ratio.</b>|$|E
500|$|In January 2007, the F-22 {{reportedly}} maintained 97% sortie rate, flying 102 out of 105 tasked sorties while amassing a 144-to-zero <b>kill</b> <b>ratio</b> during [...] "Northern Edge" [...] air-to-air {{exercises in}} Alaska. According to Lieutenant Colonel Wade Tolliver, squadron {{commander of the}} 27th Fighter Squadron, the stealth coatings of the F-22 are more robust than those used in earlier stealth aircraft, being less sensitive to weather and wear and tear.

Regardless, it would be nearly a year before additional Australian forces would finally arrive in Vietnam. Although Graham had quickly established himself since taking over as Commander 1 ATF in January, and had developed a sound operational concept, the Viet Cong had succeeded in preventing him from implementing it as he had intended. Operation Bribie confirmed in his mind the need to establish a physical barrier to deny the Viet Cong freedom of movement and thereby regain the initiative, and the subsequent decision to establish an [...] barrier minefield from Dat Do to the coast increasingly came to dominate task force planning. Yet ultimately this would prove both controversial and costly for the Australians, and despite initial success, the minefield would become a source of munitions for the Viet Cong to use against 1 ATF and later the decision would be made to remove it in 1969.|$|E
5000|$|Ratcliffe further {{wrote in}} his own book, Eye of the Storm, [...] "I was {{somewhat}} taken aback by many of McNab's anecdotes. He {{made no mention of}} the meetings he had with the CO and myself in which we tried to persuade him to take a vehicle or cut down on the amount of kit the patrol would be carrying". As with Asher, Ratcliffe also cited McNab's estimate of 250 enemy casualties as counter to any proven theory of military <b>kill</b> <b>ratios,</b> but most importantly, the figure was never mentioned in any of the Regimental debriefs given by McNab at the time.|$|R

Especially notable were several T-54 kills credited to an AML-90 platoon in the Sinai Peninsula: as late as the 1980s, military scholars continued to maintain that the 90mm DEFA cannon lacked the muzzle velocity to penetrate the thick steel hull of a T-54/55. More well-documented cases have since verified this was possible, though only with multiple shots or a direct hit on the turret rim near the driver's hatch. Israeli AML crews also sustained losses of their own during this engagement, and some AML-90s may have been captured intact by the Egyptian defenders.|$|R
