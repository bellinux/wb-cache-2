40|$|Actovegin® is a <b>deproteinized</b> <b>serum</b> extract of bovine origin, and {{in recent}} years it has been used widely in {{treating}} sport injuries with many anecdotal reports of success. However, the use of Actovegin® in sport medicine has caused a substantial amount of controversy, especially concerning its supposed oxygen-enhancing capacity and an anecdotal belief that its use can increase an athlete's performance. In 2009, a sports physician was arrested with this 'performance-enhancing drug,' while an editorial in a sports medicine journal strongly questioned the evidence base for using this drug for acute muscle injury. There is also a report that suggested that Actovegin® might have induced anaphylactic shock in a cyclist. In this review, we have systematically examined the current evidence on Actovegin®. Its mechanism of action, clinical evidence, legal status with sports governing bodies, and its potential role in sport injuries will be discussed.

40|$|Cyclaradine {{is a novel}} carbocyclic {{nucleoside}} {{with good}} activity against the viruses of the herpes group. To facilitate pharmacokinetic studies on cyclaradine, an automated column-switching high-performance liquid chromatographic (HPLC) method was developed for the determination of cyclaradine in serum. <b>Deproteinized</b> <b>serum</b> containing cyclaradine was directed to an on-line extraction column which retained cyclaradine while many potentially interfering components were eluted to waste. Fourteen minutes later, the switching valve was automatically rotated, permitting an appropriate mobile phase to elute cyclaradine from the extraction column onto an analytical C 18 column for further separation and UV detection. The method showed excellent linearity (r = 0. 9995) for cyclaradine concentrations ranging from 0. 05 to 5 micrograms/ml. It also provided good sensitivity (0. 05 micrograms/ml). The assay was precise, with within-run and between-run coefficients of variation of less than 1. 90 %. The accuracy, expressed as differences between observed values and theoretical values, ranged from - 4. 12 to 4. 80 %. The assay involves a simple deproteinization of serum followed by a fully automated sample cleanup, eliminating long and tedious manual extraction prior to HPLC. The column-switching HPLC method has been successfully used for the determination of cyclaradine serum levels in squirrel monkeys following a single oral dose of 20 mg/kg...|$|E
40|$|HERE ARE MANY TECHNICS and {{procedures}} {{used for the}} determina-tion of calcium and magnesium in blood serum but more rapid and accurate methods would be of great value. Complexometric titrations using disodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA) as titrant and metal indicators were proposed {{for the analysis of}} Ca or Mg, or both. Elliot (1) described the direct titration of calcium with EDTA using murexide as indicator; however, this indicator is unstable and has a poor visual end point. Andersch (2) used calcein for the determina-tion of Ca. Gobby, Hildebrand, and Reffley (3) used a recently re-ported indicator, Calcon (4), for the direct titration of Ca. However, they report some difficulty in the exact location of the end point. These methods are less time consuming than the widely used method of Clark and Coup (5). However, they have the disadvantage of the rather difficult and/or indistinct end-point detection. It was recently shown by Malmstadt and Hadjiioannou (6) that Ca and Mg in dolomites and limestones can be determined rapidly and accurately by an automatic derivative spectrophotometric titra-tion procedure using EDTA as titrant. The same general automatic procedure is well suited for the determination of Ca and Mg in blood serum, as shown by the results presented here. The method is accurate and satisfies the clinician’s demand for speed of determination. The Ca is determined in an aliquot of the diluted <b>deproteinized</b> <b>serum</b> sample by adjusting the pH to about 13 with NaOH to precipitate the Mg, adding Calcon indicator, inserting the beaker into the titrator, pressing the start button, and reading the buret after the titration is automatically terminated at the en...|$|E
40|$|Fast and {{sensitive}} devices for monitoring of glucose are crucial in today’s medicine. Most {{of the commercial}} glucometers are currently based on enzymatic catalysis which provides reasonable sensitivity but has a drawback in limited enzyme stability. With the development of novel surfaces, new generation of non-enzymatic sensors characterized by high sensitivity and stability is emerging. In this work, gelatin-templated nanostructured gold electrodes were developed and applied for non-enzymatic glucose determination. The analysis was done by direct electrochemical oxidation during cyclic voltammetry and amperometry with the limit of detection at 1. 3 μM. The ability to detect physiological levels glucose in presence of interferents was demonstrated on <b>deproteinized</b> human blood <b>serum...</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{simple but}} {{powerful}} method for the sensing of peptides {{in aqueous solution}} has been developed. The transition-metal complexes [PdCl 2 (en) ], [{RhCl 2 Cp*} 2], and [{RuCl 2 (p-cymene) } 2] were combined with six different fluorescent dyes to build a cross-reactive sensor array. The fluorescence response of the individual sensor units was based on competitive complexation reactions between the peptide analytes and the fluorescent dyes. The collective response of the sensor array in a time-resolved fashion {{was used as an}} input for multivariate analyses. A sensor array comprised of only six metal-dye combinations was able to differentiate ten different dipeptides in buffered aqueous solution at a concentration of 50 μM. Further more, the cross-reactive sensor could be used to obtain information about the identity and the quantity of the pharmacologically interesting dipeptides carnosine and homocarnosine in a complex biological matrix, such as <b>deproteinized</b> human blood <b>serum.</b> The sensor array was also able to sense longer peptides, which was demonstrated by differentiating mixtures of the nonapeptide bradykinin and the decapeptide kallidin...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{analytical}} procedure {{has been developed}} for the determination of indican and tryptophan in biological fluids by reversed-phase liquid chromatography using a new electrochemical detector consisting of a tubular anode obtained by moulding graphitized carbon black and polyethylene. The hydrodynamic voltammetry of these compounds {{has been carried out}} and it has been found that, by operating in isocratic conditions with phosphate buffer (pH 4. 0) —methanol (93 : 7), the reported compounds can he determined directly. The procedure can be applied for the determination of the free compounds on ultrafiltered serum as well as of their total content on <b>serum</b> <b>deproteinized</b> with methanol. Levels of both compounds in normal and uraemic patients have been measured and the relative ratios between free and total content yield a useful marker for patients with renal disease. The limits of quantitation of indican and tryptophan in serum were 5 and 10 ng/ml, respectively. The within-day assay coefficient of variation for total indican and tryptophan ranged from 3. 0 to 3. 6 % and from 3. 8 to 4. 1 %, respectively. The day-to-day assay coefficient of variation for total indican and tryptophan ranged from 3. 4 to 3. 7 % and from 4. 6 to 5. 0 %, respectively...|$|R
40|$|An {{accurate}} {{method for}} determination of proline in serum has been adapted to a micro scale, with good results. Acidic ethanol {{is used as}} a <b>serum</b> <b>deproteinizing</b> agent prior to development of color with ninhydrin and its extraction into benzene. The range of ac-curacy is ± 3. 0 % with as little as 0. 2 ml. serum. The microdetermination of this amino acid facilitates study of the intermediary metabolism of proline in pediatric patients as well as in small laboratory animals. The method is also useful in the study of amino acid and collagen biosynthesis in a number of experimental systems. IN THE STUDY OF THE intermediary metabolism of prolille, a highly spe-cific and accurate method is required for its determination in serum. The method proposed by Chinard (1) for use in the quantitative assay of this amino acid utilizes the characteristic red color produced when proline interacts with ninhydriii in acidic solution. The compound is a diketo-hydrindylidine pyrrole and has an absorption maximum at 315 m in benzene (2, 3). Earlier studies in our laboratory (4) indicated that com-mon protein-precipitating agents such as trichloroacetic acid and tung-stic acid were unsatisfactory. This report describes the use of an acidic ethanol solution for precipitation of protein from micro quantities of se-rum prior to determination of proline...|$|R
40|$|Monitoring {{the hormones}} in equine matrix {{is crucial to}} {{understanding}} the health status of horses, and also to monitoring the abuse of these substances before a race or a horse transaction. Few analytical procedures exist {{and those that do}} are “self made methods”, generally based on immunoassay analysis, often impossible to replicate in other laboratories or too complex for the staff. On that, it is necessary to develop new sensitive analytical methods, that can be diffused to external vets and giving correct and comparable results. Furthermore, the few analytical procedures involving an HPLC-MS-MS system reported in literature allow for simultaneous quantification of no more than three or four hormones [1][2]. The proposed method makes it possible to detect and quantify seventeen hormones and metabolites in a single assay, in just eleven minutes. Quantifiable hormones with the proposed method are: Pregnenolon, 17 -OH-Pregnenolon, Progesteron, 17 -OH-Progesteron, Androsteron, Androstenedion, DHEA, DHEAS, Testosteron, Cortisol, Corticosteron, Aldosteron, 11 -Deossicortisol, 11 -Deossicorticosteron, Diidrotestosteron, Estron, Estradiol. Three deuterated hormones (Cortisol-D 4, Aldosteron-D 7, Testosteron-D 3) have been used as internal standards in order to set a more accurate and precise procedure. The method was developed using the Agilent UHPLC chromatographic system (1290) using a Zorbax RRHD C 18 – 1, 8 μm column and a 6420 Agilent Mass Spectrometer. The procedure is fast and intuitive; the sample preparation is very easy, with the <b>serum</b> <b>deproteinized</b> in vials using a deproteinizing solution, centifuged and injected into the system. The mobile phases are made of water and acetonitrile, both containing formic acid. Overall, the method is very simple and robust and it brings about a remarkable saving of time and money with respect to previously reported methods; in fact, using the UHPLC–Tandem Mass spectrometer enables simultaneous quantification of seventeen Steroidal Hormones...|$|R
