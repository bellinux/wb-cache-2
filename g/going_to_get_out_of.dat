25|$|Until {{the end of}} the 2000–01 season, Bristol Rovers {{had been}} the only team in the Football League never to have played in the first or the fourth levels of the league. This record ended when the team were relegated to Division 3 for the 2001–02 season. Holloway {{resigned}} at the halfway point of the season, and Garry Thompson took over {{for the rest of the}} campaign, but was unable to prevent relegation. Gerry Francis returned to the club and oversaw a good start that saw them top the division at the end of August; results soon faded however, and it became clear that Rovers were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the division at the first attempt. Francis resigned due to personal issues in December with the side in 20th place, leading to Garry Thompson being reinstated as manager. Despite masterminding a cup upset against Premier League opponents Derby County, Rovers' League form remained poor, and the club hit its lowest ebb, finishing second bottom of the whole League and only surviving due to a truly awful season by bottom-placed Halifax Town.|$|E
500|$|Kate Mulgrew {{suggested}} that the show incorporate a new and stronger antagonist, saying: [...] "We need [...] to encounter enemies of such ferocity, enemies who in fact are quite lethal and frightening. Enemies that you would watch and say, 'Oh, boy, how are they <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this one?' I don't think the Kazon hit the bill." [...] Mulgrew felt the crew's mission to get home was a more compelling storyline than those related to the Kazon, whom she criticized as [...] "great big stupid giants".|$|E
500|$|Hambleton's and Clark's spirits sank {{when they}} {{realized}} that six men died while attempting to rescue them. After a stern sermon from the new on scene commander Nail 32 Capt. John Van Etten, Hambleton decided, [...] "Hell, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this, regardless." [...] He camouflaged his hole, hiding there for seven nights and six days. He left the hole twice to scavenge for food and was almost caught the second {{time when he was}} spotted by a boy and his dog. NVA soldiers searching for him passed within [...] of his hole twice.|$|E

500|$|As {{with the}} ISKCON-inspired [...] "Awaiting on You All", Allison views the {{conditions}} that Harrison imposes in the song's choruses as a rare exception within the singer's work. Elsewhere, Allison continues, Harrison's songwriting reveals [...] "a strong belief in the efficacy of unmerited divine grace". In a 1982 interview, Harrison described his statement on God rewarding those who first look to God as a [...] "flexible" [...] one, adding: [...] "In one way, I'm never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> here [...] unless it's by His grace, but then again … he amount of grace I would expect from God should be equal {{to the amount of}} grace I can gather or earn." ...|$|E
500|$|Late that night, on {{the night}} of 16 July, the family was awakened and told to come down to the lower level of the house because there was unrest in the town at large and they would have to be moved for their own safety. The family emerged from their rooms {{carrying}} pillows, bags, and other items to make Alexandra and Alexei comfortable. The family paused and crossed themselves when they saw the stuffed mother bear and cubs that stood on the landing, perhaps as a sign of respect for the dead. Nicholas told the servants and family [...] "Well, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this place." [...] They asked questions of the guards but did not appear to suspect {{they were going to be}} killed. Yurovsky, who had been a professional photographer, directed the family to take different positions as a photographer might. Alexandra, who had requested chairs for herself and Alexei, sat to her son's left. The Tsar stood behind Alexei, Dr. Botkin stood to the Tsar's right, Tatiana and her sisters stood behind Alexandra along with the servants. They were left for approximately half an hour while further preparations were made. The group said little during this time, but Alexandra whispered to the girls in English, violating the guard's rules that they must speak in Russian. Yurovsky came in, ordered them to stand, and read the sentence of execution. Tatiana and her family had time only to utter a few incoherent sounds of shock or protest before the death squad under Yurovsky's command began shooting. It was the early hours of 17 July 1918.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the start}} of the Yom Kippur War on October 6, 1973, Sharon was called back to active duty along with his {{assigned}} reserve armored division. On his farm, before he left for the front line, the Reserve Commander, Zeev Amit, said to him, [...] "How are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this?" [...] Sharon replied, [...] "You don't know? We will cross the Suez Canal and the war will end over there." [...] Sharon arrived at the front, to participate in his fourth war, in a civilian car. His forces did not engage the Egyptian Army immediately, despite his requests. Under cover of darkness, Sharon's forces moved to a point on the Suez Canal that had been prepared before the war. In a move that again thwarted the commands of his superiors, Sharon's division crossed the Suez, effectively winning the war for Israel. He then headed north towards Ismailia, intent on cutting the Egyptian second army's supply lines, but his division was halted south of the Fresh Water Canal.|$|E
2500|$|Broken Steel {{has had a}} {{generally}} positive reception, averaging an 81 for the PC and an 82 for the Xbox 360. The Sacramento Bee wrote [...] "The previous two downloadable expansions are good, but this one's pretty much essential for a Fallout 3 fan". IGN mirrored this view by stating [...] "Lifting the level cap breathes new life into a great game, but shouldn't totally overshadow {{a new series of}} quests that is a lot of fun." [...] Edge on the other hand, while commenting that [...] "it's the most you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Fallouts current batch of DLC", it felt [...] "it lacks the scope or density of s [...]" [...] The A.V. Club commented that [...] "After deflating the finality of the original ending, Broken Steel is unsure what to do next, beyond sending you on a few entertaining but hollow missions to snuff out the remnants of the para-military Enclave. Thankfully, the expansion's B-story is more thoughtful, as it plunges into the chaos and profiteering that result when a limited supply of clean water starts flowing into the Wasteland." ...|$|E

But then, ever so slowly, the walls start closing in and it's like you're never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this fucking place. It's an ugly nightmare and there's no escape." [...] To convey {{the effects of the}} various drugs, Gilliam and Pecorini assembled a list of [...] "phases" [...] that detailed the [...] "cinematic qualities" [...] of each drug consumed. For ether, Pecorini said they used a [...] "loose depth of field; everything becomes non-defined"; for adrenochrome, [...] "everything gets narrow and claustrophobic, move closer with lens"; mescaline was simulated by having [...] "colors melt into each other, flares with no sources, play with color temperatures"; for amyl nitrite, the [...] "perception of light gets very uneven, light levels increase and decrease during the shots"; and for LSD, [...] "everything extremely wide, hallucinations via morphs, shapes, colors, and sound." ...|$|E
