5|$|Louis Stanislas lived a {{quiet and}} {{sedentary}} lifestyle at this point, {{not having a}} great deal to do since his self-proclaimed political exclusion in 1774. He kept himself occupied with <b>his</b> <b>vast</b> library of over 11,000 books at Balbi's pavilion, reading for several hours each morning. In the early 1780s, he also incurred huge debts totalling 10million livres, which his brother Louis XVI paid.|$|E
5|$|Sejanus was {{so great}} a person by reason both of his {{excessive}} haughtiness and of <b>his</b> <b>vast</b> power, that, to put it briefly, he himself {{seemed to be the}} emperor and Tiberius a kind of island potentate, inasmuch as the latter spent his time on the island of Capreae.|$|E

5|$|In his retirement, Browne {{continued}} {{his involvement in}} the sport, using <b>his</b> <b>vast</b> experience to serve the sport as an administrator. Browne served as the Vice President of the Victorian Amateur Cycling Association and he strongly advocated the use of a handicap system in racing, believing that it would improve the standard of racing and improve Australia's success rate. At the age of 39, he married Rhonda, a primary school teacher. They had three children, a girl and two boys.|$|E
5|$|Rothenberg's {{legacy is}} not only the generations of {{scholars}} he prepared, but also <b>his</b> <b>vast</b> historiographical contribution to understanding the Revolutionary era. For many years, his Army of Francis Joseph (1976) was the standard and the only English language analysis of the Habsburg Army in the French Revolutionary and the Napoleonic wars. He changed the widespread perception of Archduke Charles' military acumen. A masterful historian, Rothenberg was known furthermore as an eminently fair scholar. After publishing a critique of a publication, the author contacted him, and proved the critique unjust; Rothenberg immediately wrote to a review retracting the criticism, and the two scholars remained friends for the remainder of his life.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Gardiner was refused {{access to}} Henry {{during his last}} months. Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, found himself accused of treason; {{the day before the}} king's death <b>his</b> <b>vast</b> estates were seized, making them {{available}} for redistribution, and he spent the whole of Edward's reign in the Tower of London. Other historians have argued that Gardiner's exclusion was based on non-religious matters, that Norfolk was not noticeably conservative in religion, that conservatives remained on the Council, and that the radicalism of such men as Sir Anthony Denny, who controlled the dry stamp that replicated the king's signature, is debatable.|$|E

5|$|Browne was {{regarded}} as an intelligent and meticulous athlete, who was known for a logical and somewhat introspective style in his approach to the sport. He felt {{that he did not}} have the raw speed to match the likes of Lionel Cox and Dick Ploog in vying for selection in Australia's sprint team, and that he was not suited to long road races, instead focusing on medium length track racing. Browne typically was the front rider in tandem races, liking to be in control. He {{was regarded}} to be a cyclist who behaved in a careful and scholarly manner, and was known for coaxing higher levels of performance out of his younger partners. Browne was respected for his technical knowledge of the tandem and his success was often attributed to <b>his</b> <b>vast</b> experience.|$|E
5|$|East Germany was {{particularly}} {{successful in the}} 1970s and 1980s, when they dominated the women's events, aided by systematic state-sponsored doping. Their women swept the award for the first ten years of its existence from 1980 to 1989, with Kristin Otto winning three times, before the Berlin Wall and communism fell. With {{the end of the}} state-sponsored doping program, the (East) German stranglehold on women's swimming was broken. In the two decades since reunification, the female award was won by Germans four times, three by Franziska van Almsick. During the 1980s, Michael Gross of West Germany, nicknamed The Albatross in reference to <b>his</b> <b>vast</b> wingspan, dominated European swimming, winning five consecutive awards from 1982 to 1986. Swimming World has vacated all awards previously awarded to East German swimmers because of the government-sanctioned systematic doping.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{other great}} {{scholars}} {{of the age}} he travelled little and his knowledge of geography came from his library of over one thousand books and maps, from his visitors and from <b>his</b> <b>vast</b> correspondence (in six languages) with other scholars, statesmen, travellers, merchants and seamen. Mercator's early maps were in large formats suitable for wall mounting but {{in the second half}} of his life he produced over 100 new regional maps in a smaller format suitable for binding into his Atlas of 1595. This was the first appearance of the word Atlas in a geographical context but Mercator used it as a neologism for a treatise (Cosmologia) on the creation, history and description of the universe, not simply a collection of maps. He chose the word as a commemoration of a King Atlas of Mauretania whom he considered to be the first great geographer. This King Atlas was a son of the Titan Atlas but the two myths very quickly coalesced.|$|E
