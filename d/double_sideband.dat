25|$|Another {{improvement}} over standard AM is obtained through reduction or {{suppression of the}} carrier component of the modulated spectrum. In Figure 2 this is the spike in between the sidebands; even with full (100%) sine wave modulation, the power in the carrier component is twice that in the sidebands, yet it carries no unique information. Thus {{there is a great}} advantage in efficiency in reducing or totally suppressing the carrier, either in conjunction with elimination of one sideband (single-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission) or with both sidebands remaining (<b>double</b> <b>sideband</b> suppressed carrier). While these suppressed carrier transmissions are efficient in terms of transmitter power, they require more sophisticated receivers employing synchronous detection and regeneration of the carrier frequency. For that reason, standard AM continues to be widely used, especially in broadcast transmission, to allow for the use of inexpensive receivers using envelope detection. Even (analog) television, with a (largely) suppressed lower sideband, includes sufficient carrier power for use of envelope detection. But for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized, suppression of both one sideband and the carrier represent a net advantage and are frequently employed.|$|E

50|$|In the Armstrong method, {{the audio}} signal {{and the radio}} {{frequency}} carrier signal are applied to the balanced modulator to generate a <b>double</b> <b>sideband</b> suppressed carrier signal. The phase of this output signal is then shifted 90 degrees {{with respect to the}} original carrier. The balanced modulator output can either lead or lag the carrier's phase. The <b>double</b> <b>sideband</b> signal and the original carrier signal are then applied to the mixer, and the original carrier—90 degrees out of phase—is reinserted. The output from the mixer is a frequency modulated signal.|$|E
50|$|Phase noise (ℒ(f)) is {{typically}} expressed in units of dBc/Hz, and {{it represents the}} noise power relative to the carrier contained in a 1 Hz bandwidth centered at a certain offsets from the carrier. For example, a certain signal may have a phase noise of -80 dBc/Hz at an offset of 10 kHz and -95 dBc/Hz at an offset of 100 kHz. Phase noise can be measured and expressed as single sideband or <b>double</b> <b>sideband</b> values, but as noted earlier, the IEEE has adopted the definition as one-half of the <b>double</b> <b>sideband</b> PSD.|$|E

5000|$|In 1933, Edwin H. Armstrong {{patented}} {{a method}} for generating frequency modulation of radio signals. [...] The Armstrong method generates a <b>double</b> <b>sideband</b> suppressed carrier signal, phase shifts this signal, and then reinserts the carrier to produce a frequency modulated signal.|$|E

50|$|SSB, or SSB-AM single-sideband {{full carrier}} modulation, {{is very similar}} to single-sideband {{suppressed}} carrier modulation (SSB-SC). It is used where it is necessary to receive the audio on an AM receiver, while using less bandwidth than with <b>double</b> <b>sideband</b> AM. Due to high distortion, it is seldom used.Either SSB-AM or SSB-SC are produced by the following methods.|$|E
5000|$|ISB is a {{compromise}} between <b>double</b> <b>sideband</b> (DSB) and single sideband (SSB) [...] - [...] the other is vestigial sideband (VSB). If the sidebands are out of phase with each other, then phase modulation (PM) of the carrier occurs. AM and PM together then create quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM). ISB {{may or may not}} have the carrier suppressed.|$|E
50|$|A {{balanced}} modulator mixes the audio signal {{and the radio}} frequency carrier, but suppresses the carrier, leaving only the sidebands. The output from the {{balanced modulator}} is a <b>double</b> <b>sideband</b> suppressed carrier signal and it contains {{all the information that}} the AM signal has, but without the carrier. It is possible to generate an AM signal by taking the output from the balanced modulator and reinserting the carrier.|$|E
50|$|If no 19 kHz {{pilot tone}} is present, then any signals in the 23-53 kHz range are ignored by a stereo receiver. A guard band of ±4 kHz (15-23 kHz) protects the pilot tone from {{interference}} from the baseband audio signal (50 Hz-15 kHz) {{and from the}} lower sideband of the <b>double</b> <b>sideband</b> stereo information (23-53 kHz). The third harmonic of the pilot (19&times;3, or 57 kHz) is used for Radio Data System.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} equalise the low {{frequency}} and high frequency {{components of the}} VF signal, a filter named a Nyquist filter is used in receivers. This filter, which is used before demodulation, is actually a low-pass filter with 6 dB suppression at the intermediate frequency (IF) carrier. Thus the level of <b>double</b> <b>sideband</b> portion of the VF signal is suppressed and the original band characteristic is reconstructed at {{the output of the}} demodulator.|$|E
50|$|FM stereo {{broadcasts}} {{contain a}} pilot tone at 19 kHz when stereo {{information is available}} at higher frequencies. This system was developed jointly by Zenith and General Electric. The normal monaural audio, the pilot tone (which serves as a phase reference when decoding the stereophonic information) and the <b>double</b> <b>sideband</b> stereophonic difference information are all mixed and broadcast together. The process of encoding the difference signal into the 23-53kHz band via double-sideband carrier-suppressed amplitude modulation is an instance of multiplexing.|$|E
50|$|For shorter distances, cheaper {{balanced}} {{pair cables}} {{were used for}} various systems including Bell System K- and N-Carrier. Those cables didn't allow such large bandwidths, so only 12 voice channels (<b>double</b> <b>sideband)</b> and later 24 (single sideband) were multiplexed into four wires, one pair for each direction with repeaters every several miles, approximately 10 km. See 12-channel carrier system. By {{the end of the}} 20th Century, FDM voice circuits had become rare. Modern telephone systems employ digital transmission, in which time-division multiplexing (TDM) is used instead of FDM.|$|E
5000|$|When VSB filter {{is used in}} broadcasting, {{a problem}} arises during demodulation. While 0 - 0.75 MHz region has two side bands, the region beyond 1.25 MHz has only one side band. ( [...] i.e., 0 - 0.75 MHz region is <b>double</b> <b>{{sideband}}</b> and the region beyond 1.25 MHz is single sideband [...] ) Thus, {{the level of the}} demodulated signal in 0 - 0.75 MHz region is 6 dB higher than the level in the region beyond 1.25 MHz. Since high frequency components of the VF signal correspond to fine details and color subcarrier, the demodulation results in fading the detailed portions and color saturation of the picture with respect to less detailed portions of the picture.|$|E
5000|$|Aircraft {{communications}} {{radio operations}} worldwide use amplitude modulation, predominantly A3E <b>double</b> <b>sideband</b> with full carrier on VHF and UHF, and J3E single sideband with suppressed carrier on HF.

Even if both transmissions are received with identical signal strength, a heterodyne will be heard where no such indication of blockage would be evident in an FM system.|$|E
50|$|The PM {{modulation}} index is small, {{on the order}} of 1 radian, so the modulated signal more closely resembled <b>double</b> <b>sideband</b> amplitude modulation (AM) except for the carrier phase. A PM signal can be approximated for analysis purposes as an AM signal with the carrier (and only the carrier) rotated 90 degrees from its original phase. One important difference is that in AM, the carrier component has a constant amplitude as the sidebands vary with modulation while in PM the total signal (the envelope) is constant amplitude. This means that PM shifts power from the carrier to the information-carrying sidebands with modulation, and at some modulation indices the carrier can disappear completely. This is why Apollo uses a low {{modulation index}}: to leave a strong carrier {{that can be used for}} highly accurate velocity tracking by measurement of its Doppler shift.|$|E
5000|$|Amplitude {{modulation}} of {{a carrier}} signal normally results in two mirror-image sidebands. The signal components above the carrier frequency constitute the upper sideband (USB), and those below the carrier frequency constitute the lower sideband (LSB). For example, if a 900 kHz carrier is amplitude modulated by a 1 kHz audio signal, {{there will be}} components at 899 kHz and 901 kHz as well as 900 kHz in the generated Radio Frequency spectrum; so an audio bandwidth of (say) 7 kHz will require a radio spectrum bandwidth of 14 kHz. In conventional AM transmission, as used by [...] "Broadcast Band" [...] AM stations, the original audio signal can be recovered ("detected") by either synchronous detector circuits or by simple envelope detectors because the carrier and both sidebands are present. This is sometimes called <b>double</b> <b>sideband</b> amplitude modulation (DSB-AM), but not all variants of DSB are compatible with envelope detectors.|$|E
50|$|Another {{improvement}} over standard AM is obtained through reduction or {{suppression of the}} carrier component of the modulated spectrum. In Figure 2 this is the spike in between the sidebands; even with full (100%) sine wave modulation, the power in the carrier component is twice that in the sidebands, yet it carries no unique information.

But for communications systems where both transmitters and receivers can be optimized, suppression of both one sideband and the carrier represent a net advantage and are frequently employed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{some forms}} of AM, the carrier may be reduced, to save power. The term DSB - Reduced Carrier {{normally}} implies enough carrier remains in the transmission to enable a receiver circuit to regenerate a strong carrier or at least synchronise a phase-locked loop but there are forms where the carrier is removed completely, producing <b>double</b> <b>sideband</b> with suppressed carrier (DSB-SC). Suppressed carrier systems require more sophisticated circuits in the receiver and some other method of deducing the original carrier frequency. An example is the stereophonic difference (L-R) information transmitted in stereo FM broadcasting on a 38 kHz subcarrier where a low-power signal at half the 38-kHz carrier frequency is inserted between the monaural signal frequencies (up to 15 kHz) and {{the bottom of the}} stereo information sub-carrier (down to 38-15 kHz, i.e. 23kHz). The receiver locally regenerates the subcarrier by doubling a special 19 kHz pilot tone. In another example, the quadrature modulation used historically for chroma information in PAL television broadcasts, the synchronising signal is a short burst of a few cycles of carrier during the [...] "back porch" [...] part of each scan line when no image is transmitted. But in other DSB-SC systems, the carrier may be regenerated directly from the sidebands by a Costas loop or squaring loop. This is common in digital transmission systems such as BPSK where the signal is continually present.|$|E
