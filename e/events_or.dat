50|$|There {{are several}} {{levels in the}} {{covariation}} model: high and low. Each of these levels influences the three covariation model criteria. High consensus is when many people can agree on an <b>event</b> <b>or</b> area of interest. Low consensus is when very few people can agree. High distinctiveness is when the <b>event</b> <b>or</b> area of interest is very unusual, whereas low distinctness is when the <b>event</b> <b>or</b> area of interest is fairly common. High consistency is when the <b>event</b> <b>or</b> area of interest continues for a length of time and low consistency is when the <b>event</b> <b>or</b> area of interest goes away quickly.|$|R

5|$|Aspirin {{appears to}} offer little benefit to those at {{lower risk of}} heart attack or stroke—for instance, those without a history of these <b>events</b> <b>or</b> with {{pre-existing}} disease. Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis, while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely. Aspirin has also been suggested as a component of a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|Goya {{worked on}} The Disasters of War {{during a period}} when he was {{producing}} images more for his own satisfaction than for any contemporary audience. His work came to rely less on historical incidents than his own imagination. Many of the later plates contain fantastical motifs which {{can be seen as}} a return to the imagery of the Caprichos. In this, he is relying on visual clues derived from his inner life, rather than anything that could be recognised from real <b>events</b> <b>or</b> settings.|$|E
5|$|In {{years in}} which the Nobel Prize is not awarded due to {{external}} <b>events</b> <b>or</b> a lack of nominations, the prize money is returned to the funds delegated to the relevant prize. The Nobel Prize was not awarded between 1940 and 1942 due to the outbreak of World WarII.|$|E

50|$|A {{happening}} is a performance, <b>event,</b> <b>or</b> situation {{meant to be}} considered art, usually as performance art. The term was first used by Allan Kaprow during the 1950s to describe a range of art-related <b>event</b> <b>or</b> multiple <b>events.</b>|$|R
40|$|The author {{argues that}} {{experiences}} are complex events that befall their subjects. Each experience {{has a single}} subject and depends on what it is of, either a state <b>or</b> <b>event.</b> An experience depends on its subject, its grounding <b>event</b> <b>or</b> state, and everything that the subject is aware of during that time that’s relevant to the telling {{of the story of}} how it was to participate in that <b>event</b> <b>or</b> be put in that state. The experience occurs where the person having the experience is. An experience of an <b>event</b> <b>or</b> state occurs when that <b>event</b> <b>or</b> state makes a difference to its possessor’s conscious life, where this difference is either a matter of really knowing what’s happening or merely a matter of being affected.

5|$|Many Final Fantasy {{games have}} been adapted as novels and manga series. With {{the advent of}} the Internet, web novels and digital {{publishing}} have also become common.

Most {{of those involved}} in competitive sports select, organise and manage individuals or teams to represent their country at international <b>events</b> <b>or</b> fixtures against other countries. Wales is represented at major world sporting events such as the FIFA World Cup, Rugby World Cup, Rugby League World Cup and the Commonwealth Games. At the Olympics Games, Welsh athletes compete alongside those of Scotland, England and Northern Ireland as part of a Great Britain team.|$|E
5|$|Occasionalism is {{the view}} espoused by Nicholas Malebranche that asserts that all {{supposedly}} causal relations between physical <b>events,</b> <b>or</b> between physical and mental events, are not really causal at all. While body and mind are different substances, causes (whether mental or physical) are related to their effects {{by an act of}} God's intervention on each specific occasion.|$|E

Structurally, it consists of nine books that, because of the immense time span, often do not share common characters or settings; the third-person narrative voice, which has been likened to that of an anonymous chronicler, does not pass judgment on the <b>events</b> <b>or</b> provide commentary that would help tie events together.|$|E

Alternately, it may be adapted into a storage and transport vehicle for crime scene identification equipment, a command post at community <b>events,</b> <b>or</b> support vehicle, such as a logistics unit. Others are refurbished and resold, or may just have their emergency equipment removed {{to be sold to}} private businesses or individuals, who then can use them as small recreational vehicles.|$|E
5000|$|A present sense impression, {{in the law}} of evidence, is a {{statement}} made by a person (the declarant) that conveys his or her sense {{of the state of}} an <b>event</b> <b>or</b> the condition of something. The statement must be spontaneously made while the person was perceiving (i.e. contemporaneous with) the <b>event</b> <b>or</b> condition, or [...] "immediately thereafter." [...] The permissible time lapse between event and statement may range from seconds to minutes, but probably not hours. The subject matter and content of the statement are limited to descriptions or explanations of the <b>event</b> <b>or</b> condition, therefore opinions, inferences, or conclusions about the <b>event</b> <b>or</b> condition are not present sense impressions. An example of present sense impression is of a person saying, [...] "it's cold" [...] or [...] "we're going really fast".|$|R

5|$|According to polls {{conducted}} by mainstream media, most Japanese people had perceived {{the flag of}} Japan as the national flag even before {{the passage of the}} Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem in 1999. Despite this, controversies surrounding the use of the flag in school <b>events</b> <b>or</b> media still remain. For example, liberal newspapers such as Asahi Shimbun and Mainichi Shimbun often feature articles critical of the flag of Japan, reflecting their readerships' political spectrum. To other Japanese, the flag represents the time where democracy was suppressed when Japan was an empire.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} his Bond books, Fleming used <b>events</b> <b>or</b> names from his life in his writing. In the 1930s, Fleming often visited Kitzbühel in Austria to ski; he once {{deliberately}} set off down a slope that had been closed because {{of the danger of}} an avalanche. The snow cracked behind him and an avalanche came down, catching him at its end: Fleming remembered the incident and it was used for Bond's escape from Piz Gloria. Fleming would occasionally stay at the sports club of Schloss Mittersill in the Austrian Alps; in 1940 the Nazis closed down the club {{and turned it into a}} research establishment examining the Asiatic races. It was this pseudo-scientific research centre that inspired Blofeld's own centre of Piz Gloria.|$|E
5|$|For {{activities}} {{open to the}} public, such {{as community}} gatherings, school <b>events,</b> <b>or</b> trade shows, a police- or media-issued press pass may offer little advantage. Free or reduced-price admission, or guaranteed entry, can sometimes be arranged. The benefits may be more extensive, granting access to front-row seats or to press-only rooms. For sporting events, a press pass issued by a stadium grants access to the press box. Because open events are usually funded by paying attendees, the number of press passes may depend {{on the number of}} tickets sold.|$|E
3000|$|Temporality Deaths {{attributable}} to a disaster can occur during a slow-onset and protracted <b>event</b> <b>or</b> months, sometimes {{years after the}} initial impact of a sudden-onset event, and may differ according to the hazard.

25|$|If <b>event</b> <b>or</b> <b>event</b> chain {{occurs during}} the course of a project, it may require some {{mitigation}} effort. In some cases, mitigation plans can be generated. Mitigation plans are an activity or group of activities (small schedule) that augment the project schedule if a certain event occurs. The solution is to assign the mitigation plan to an <b>event</b> <b>or</b> <b>event</b> chain. These small schedules will be triggered when an event chain occurs. The same mitigation plan can be used for different events.|$|R
2500|$|... "A {{secondary}} {{source is}} a record or statement of an <b>event</b> <b>or</b> circumstance made by a non-eyewitness or by someone not closely connected with the <b>event</b> <b>or</b> circumstances, recorded or stated verbally either at or sometime after the <b>event,</b> <b>or</b> by an eye-witness at a time after the event when the fallibility of memory is an important factor." [...] Consequently, according to this definition, a first-hand account written long after the event [...] "when the fallibility of memory is an important factor" [...] is a secondary source, {{even though it may}} be the first published description of that event.|$|R
5|$|Martial {{reports a}} contest between an {{elephant}} and a bull, and the elephant, having won, knelt before Titus. This may have formed {{part of its}} training, but Martial attributed it to a spontaneous recognition of the Emperor's power. He also mentions a bull enraged by fires in the amphitheatre being tossed around the arena before being killed by an elephant, {{but there is nothing}} to indicate that these two epigrams are about the same <b>events</b> <b>or</b> repeated many times during the span of one hundred days of celebration.|$|E
5|$|Regarding the {{taxability}} {{of income}} {{in connection with}} <b>events</b> <b>or</b> activities not involving a government privilege or franchise, the United States Supreme Court stated in United States v. Sullivan that gains from illegal traffic in liquor {{are subject to the}} Federal income tax. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in Rutkin v. United States that the receipt of money obtained by extortion is taxable as income to the wrongdoer. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in James v. United States that the receipt of money obtained through embezzlement is taxable as income to the wrongdoer, even though the wrongdoer is required to return the money to its owner.|$|E

The year's team included two athletes engaged {{in track and field}} events (Kineke Alexander and Jared Lewis), and was accompanied by the team coach, manager, and chaperone. Saint Vincent and the Grenadines' appearance in Beijing marked its sixth consecutive Olympic appearance since its 1988 debut in Seoul, South Korea, and its smallest delegation to date. Alexander bore the flag of Saint Vincent and the Grenadines in the opening ceremony and neither athlete medaled in their <b>events</b> <b>or</b> advanced to later rounds.|$|E
