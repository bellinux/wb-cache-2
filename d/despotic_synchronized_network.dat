40|$|AbstractSlow-wave {{sleep as}} well as {{generalized}} absence seizures are characterized by the occurrence of synchronized oscillations in thalamocortical systems that spontaneously appear and disappear. The spontaneous appearance of synchronized oscillations results from the initiation by one or {{a small number of}} cells followed by the progressive recruitment of large numbers of neighboring neurons into the <b>synchronized</b> <b>network</b> activity. <b>Synchronized</b> <b>network</b> oscillations representative of slow-wave sleep, {{as well as}} absence seizures, were demonstrated to cease spontaneously at least in part through the persistent activation of a hyperpolarization-activated cation conductance.

40|$|A <b>synchronized</b> <b>network</b> time is {{essential}} for energy efficient scheduling, data fusion, localization and many other wireless sensor networks (WSN) applications. This paper studies the special issue of time synchronization in tiny sensor networking devices and presents a Delay Measurement Time Synchronization (DMTS) technique applicable for both single hop and multi-hop wireless sensor networks. DMTS is flexible and lightweight. For a single hop WSN of n nodes, it takes only one time broadcast to <b>synchronize</b> the <b>network</b> regardless the value of n. As aresult it adds minimum network traffic and is energy efficient, because radio communication is {{a significant source of}} energy-consumption in a WSN. For a multi-hop WSN of n nodes, DMTS requires n time message exchanges in total in order to <b>synchronize</b> the whole <b>network.</b> DMTS is implemented in Berkeley motes within Tiny OS framework. It is a service available to TinyOS applications. Our test results show that DMTS achieves a time synchronization accuracy of 1 clock tick in single-hop WSNs. For a 2 hop WSN, the average time synchronization error is approximately 1. 5 clock ticks. DMTS scheme is currently used in several applications running on Berkeley motes to provide network timestamps and global scheduling. 1...|$|R

We consider two situations: in the first, {{we assume that}} the effect of uncertainties vanishes as synchronization is achieved. In the second, disturbances are assume nonvanishing but bounded. To achieve robust synchronization on these situations, we design local feedback controllers, which are smooth in the first case, and discontinuous in the latter. These designs allow us to establish synchronization criteria for this class of uncertain dynamical networks. We use numerical experiments to illustrate our results...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, a {{prototype}} to <b>synchronize</b> the Peer-to-Peer <b>network</b> Kad is presented. The approach bases on a deterministic algorithm, which {{is required for}} hard real-time applications, to <b>synchronize</b> the <b>network</b> in a decentralized manner. Existing industrial Ethernet solutions include and support real-time capable machine-to-machine communication in automation sce-narios. However, the coordination of the communication and the synchronization to achieve hard real-time are managed by a central instance, leading to deficient resilience and scalability. Additionally, a centralized or hierarchical synchronization is required to enable the communication per se. The presented decentralized synchronization instead benefits from nodes helping to <b>synchronize</b> the <b>network</b> and bases on the decentralized structured Peer-to-Peer network Kad. However, the higher the number of helping nodes the higher is the time deviation on the nodes of the network, which contrary results in a higher time error. Therefore, a trade-off between synchronization performance and time error has to be determined to meet predefined constraints depending on the application scenario. Moreover, the individual clock drift of every device needs to be considered to define necessary re-synchronization intervals of the network. Theoretical values are compared to the measured values determined in experiments with 15 nodes. As {{a result of these}} experiments, the measured synchronization performance, which is the time needed to <b>synchronize</b> the complete <b>network,</b> confirms the theoretical worst case values. The result is a running prototype system, which is able to <b>synchronize</b> the <b>network</b> with a high performance in a decentralized manner. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Traditionally, the {{topography}} of somatosensory evoked potentials (SEPs) is generated based on amplitude and latency. However, this operation {{focuses on the}} physical morphology and field potential-power, so it suffers from difficulties in performing identification in an objective manner. In this study, measurement of the synchronization of SEPs is proposed as a method to explore brain functional networks {{as well as the}} plasticity after peripheral nerve injury. Method: SEPs elicited by unilateral sciatic nerve stimulation in twelve adult male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats in the normal group were compared with SEPs evoked after unilateral sciatic nerve hemisection in four peripheral nerve injured SD rats. The characterization of <b>synchronized</b> <b>networks</b> from SEPs was conducted using equal-time correlation, correlation matrix analysis, and comparison to randomized surrogate data. Eigenvalues of the correlation matrix were used to identify the clusters of functionally synchronized neuronal activity, and the participation index (PI) was calculated to indicate the involvement of each channel in the cluster. The PI value at the knee point of the PI histogram was used as a threshold to demarcate the cortical boundary. Results: Ten out of the twelve normal rats showed only one <b>synchronized</b> brain <b>network.</b> The remaining two normal rats showed one strong and one weak network. In the peripheral nerve injured group, only one <b>synchronized</b> brain <b>network</b> was found in each rat. In the normal group, all network shapes appear regular and the network is largely contained in the posterior cortex. In the injured group, the network shapes appear irregular, the network extends anteriorly and posteriorly, and the network area is significantly larger. There are considerable individual variations in the shape and location of the network after peripheral nerve injury. Conclusion: The proposed method can detect functional brain networks. Compared to the results of the traditional SEP-morphology-based analysis method, the <b>synchronized</b> functional <b>network</b> area is much larger. Furthermore, the proposed method can also characterize the rapid cortical plasticity after a peripheral nerve is acutely injured...|$|R
