50|$|Roy consigns burgled {{electronic}} equipment to Paul Reeves (Whit Bissell), {{and on his}} fifth sale is nearly caught when he shows up to collect on his property. Reeves tells police that the suspect is a mystery man named Roy Martin. The case crosses the paths of Brennan and Jones, who stake out Reeves' office to arrest and question Roy. He suspects a trap, however, and in a brief shootout shoots and paralyzes Jones. Jones wounds Roy, who performs surgery on himself to remove the bullet and avoid going to a hospital, where his gunshot wound would be reported to the police. With his knowledge of police procedures, Roy changes his modus operandi and becomes an armed robber. During one robbery he fires his semi-automatic pistol, and the police recover the ejected casing. Lee (Jack Webb), a forensics specialist, matches the <b>ejector</b> <b>marks</b> on the casing to those recovered {{in the killing of}} Officer Rawlins and the wounding of Sgt. Jones, connecting all three shootings to one suspect.|$|R
500|$|A parting line, sprue, gate <b>marks,</b> and <b>ejector</b> pin <b>marks</b> {{are usually}} {{present on the}} final part. [...] None of these {{features}} are typically desired, but are unavoidable {{due to the nature}} of the process. Gate marks occur at the gate which joins the melt-delivery channels (sprue and runner) to the part forming cavity. Parting line and <b>ejector</b> pin <b>marks</b> result from minute misalignments, wear, gaseous vents, clearances for adjacent parts in relative motion, and/or dimensional differences of the mating surfaces contacting the injected polymer. Dimensional differences can be attributed to non-uniform, pressure-induced deformation during injection, machining tolerances, and non-uniform thermal expansion and contraction of mould components, which experience rapid cycling during the injection, packing, cooling, and ejection phases of the process. Mould components are often designed with materials of various coefficients of thermal expansion. These factors cannot be simultaneously accounted for without astronomical increases in the cost of design, fabrication, processing, and quality monitoring. The skillful mould and part designer will position these aesthetic detriments in hidden areas if feasible.|$|R
40|$|Die casting is a {{versatile}} manufacturing technique in which molten metal is poured into die. The die consists of core and cavity, an impression is formed when these core and cavity are closed together. This impression forms {{the shape and}} size of the component. The main challenge in die casting is design and manufacturing of die. Integration of design and analysis yields to better results. Die casting is often encountered with many problems, few of such problems are blowholes, improper filling, scratch marks, weld lines, cracks, cold shut, porosity, blisters, <b>ejector</b> pin <b>marks,</b> etc. usually these defects are caused due to improper design of dies, or due to incorrect parameters such as injection pressure, cycle time, cooling circuits and other such parameters. In order to eliminate such defects a set of analysis has to be carried to ensure that design and other parameters are safe and efficient. Through analysis is carried to understand how the molten metal behaves inside the dies once it is injected, a clear picture about how the molten metal gets solidified is obtained during analysis. Any defects if present can be studied by analyzing the results of analysis. In this paper pro cast analysis software is used for analysis purpose, the flow of molten metal inside the impression was studied and changes to be made to the design were analyzed.

5000|$|Trumpeter plastic {{models of}} ships are {{produced}} in 1:200, 1:350, 1:500 and 1:700 scale, although 1:350 and 1:700 are dominating. Trumpeter has a cooperation with Japanese ship model manufacturer Pit-Road for kits in 1:700 scale. These kits are usually available under the Pit-Road label in Japan {{and under the}} Trumpeter label {{in the rest of}} the world.Trumpeter's ship models have included a rising number of parts, but quality is still disputed due to insufficient research and some recent releases have been over-engineered. For example, the 1:350 scale kit of the American aircraft carrier USS Hornet (CV-8) (an early release) has been found to compromise in detail ("disappointment"), while the hull form shows major mistakes and the island is also not perfect. Fit, however, is said to be excellent, and surface detail [...] "very credible". Also modern US carriers (for example the 1/700 Nimitz-class aircraft carriers) suffer from a wrong hull form. Hull form problems are also found in the Baltimore-class cruiser kits. Mistakes in the correct outfit (catapults, armament) have been pointed out regarding the details of some Essex-class carrier kits and the Bismarck-class battleships (wrong AA fit). Especially regarding the Essex class, the well known modeller Scott van Aken on the Modeling Madness website praises the kits of a competitor as preferable over Trumpeter: [...] "The moldings on the kit (of the competitor) are top rate and without the myriad of <b>ejector</b> pin <b>marks</b> that have plagued Trumpeter ship kits since day one." ...|$|R

5000|$|Forensic {{innovator}} Calvin Goddard offered ballistic identification {{evidence in}} 1921 to help secure convictions of accused murderers and anarchists Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti. On April 8, 1927, Sacco and Vanzetti were finally {{sentenced to death}} in the electric chair. A worldwide outcry arose and Governor Alvin T. Fuller finally agreed to postpone the executions and set up a committee to reconsider the case. By this time, firearms examination had improved considerably, and it was now known that a semi-automatic pistol could be traced by several different methods if both bullet and casing were recovered from the scene. Automatic pistols could now be traced by unique markings of the rifling on the bullet, by firing pin indentations on the fired primer, or by unique <b>ejector</b> and extractor <b>marks</b> on the casing. The committee appointed to review the case used the services of Calvin Goddard in 1927.Goddard used Philip Gravelle's newly invented comparison microscope and helixometer, a hollow, lighted magnifier probe used to inspect gun barrels, to make an examination of Sacco's [...]32 Colt, the bullet that killed Berardelli, and the spent casings recovered from the scene of the crime. In the presence of one of the defense experts, he fired a bullet from Sacco's gun into a wad of cotton and then put the ejected casing on the comparison microscope next to casings found at the scene. Then he looked at them carefully. The first two casings from the robbery did not match Sacco's gun, but the third one did. Even the defense expert agreed that the two cartridges had been fired from the same gun. The second original defense expert also concurred. The committee upheld the convictions.In October 1961, ballistics tests were run with improved technology using Sacco's Colt automatic. The results confirmed that the bullet that killed the victim, Berardelli in 1920 came from the same [...]32 Colt Auto taken from the pistol in Sacco's possession. Subsequent investigations in 1983 also supported Goddard's findings.|$|R
