5|$|A {{study in}} 2009 of seven {{mitochondrial}} genes (mtDNA) and three nuclear genes grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs (family Lepilemuridae), offering {{a host of}} explanations, such as a possible hybridization (introgression) following the initial split between the families. A study published in 2013 also grouped fork-marked lemurs with sportive lemurs when it used 43morphological traits and mtDNA. If correct, this would make the family Cheirogaleidae paraphyletic. Broad agreement between two lemur phylogeny studies—one in 2004 using SINE analysis and another in 2012 using multilocus phylogenetic tests—gave strong support for a sister <b>group</b> <b>relationship</b> between fork-marked lemurs {{and the rest of}} the cheirogaleids and a more distant relationship with sportive lemurs. The split between Phaner {{and the rest of the}} cheirogaleids is thought to have occurred approximately 38mya (million years ago), not long after the radiation of most of the major lemur groups on Madagascar, roughly 43mya.|$|E
25|$|In these circumstances, {{reciprocal}} exchange can {{be divided}} in two types: dyadic back-and-forth exchange (reciprocity), and pooling (redistribution). Pooling is a system of reciprocities. It is a within <b>group</b> <b>relationship,</b> whereas reciprocity is a between relationship. Pooling establishes a centre, whereas reciprocity inevitably establishes two distinct parties with their own interests. While the most basic form of pooling is that of food within the family, {{it is also the}} basis for sustained community efforts under a political leader.|$|E
500|$|According to {{analysis}} of amino acid sequences, the branching {{of the family}} Lemuridae has been dated to 26.1±3.3mya while rRNA sequences of mtDNA place the split at 24.9±3.6mya. [...] The ruffed lemurs are the first genus to split away (most basal) in the family, a view that is further supported by analysis of DNA sequences and karyotypes. [...] Additionally, Molecular data suggests a deep genetic divergence and sister <b>group</b> <b>relationship</b> between the true lemurs (Eulemur) and the remaining three genera: Lemur, Hapalemur, and Prolemur.|$|E

Three hundred twenty-five Italian graduate students {{were randomly assigned to}} 1 of 16 interpersonal growth groups that met for 9 weeks with experienced psychologists. Attachment anxiety {{and avoidance}} was assessed with the Attachment Style Questionnaire (ASQ) and the third and eighth session ratings of <b>group</b> <b>relationships</b> were assessed with the Group Questionnaire (GQ). For <b>group</b> members, the <b>relationships</b> between attachment and <b>group</b> <b>relationships</b> were stable across time; for OGMs the relation- ship between attachment and <b>group</b> <b>relationships</b> only emerged late in the group. Group member’s and OGMs attachment anxiety was positively related to positive bonding or working relationships and attachment avoidance was negatively related to positive bonding or working <b>relationships</b> for both <b>group</b> member’s and OGMs’ perceptions of <b>group</b> <b>relationships.</b> The implication of these findings for group composition is discussed...|$|R

500|$|Pachylemur is an extinct, giant lemur {{most closely}} related to the ruffed lemurs of genus Varecia. [...] Two species are known, Pachylemur insignis and Pachylemur jullyi, {{although}} there is some doubt {{as to whether or not}} they may actually be the same species. [...] Pachylemur is sometimes referred to as the giant ruffed lemur, because although it and the living ruffed lemurs had similar teeth and skeletons, Pachylemur was more robust and as much as three to four times larger. [...] DNA studies have confirmed a sister <b>group</b> <b>relationship</b> between these two types of lemur. [...] Like living ruffed lemurs, Pachylemur specialized in eating fruit, and was therefore an important seed disperser, possibly for tree species with seeds too large for even ruffed lemurs to swallow. [...] In the spiny thickets of southwestern Madagascar, they were also likely to have dispersed seeds evolved to attach to fur and be carried away. [...] Unlike ruffed lemurs, the fore- and hindlimbs of Pachylemur were nearly the same length, and therefore it was likely to be a slow, deliberate climber. [...] However, both used hindlimb suspension to reach fruit on small branches below them.|$|E
2500|$|Another form of extradyadic sex is polyamory, a [...] "non-possessive, honest, {{responsible}} and ethical philosophy {{and practice of}} loving multiple people simultaneously" [...] (Hyde, DeLamater, & Byers, 2009). There are various types of relationships in polyamory such as intentional family, <b>group</b> <b>relationship,</b> and group marriage. One type of <b>group</b> <b>relationship</b> can be a triad involving a married couple and an additional person who all share sexual intimacy, however it is usually an addition of a female (Hyde, DeLamater, & Byers, 2009). Unlike polygyny or polyandry, {{both men and women}} may have multiple partners within the confines of polyamory. Polyamorous relationships are distinguished from extramarital affairs by the full disclosure and consent of all involved. (Hyde, DeLamater, & Byers, 2009). Polyamorous relationships may specify unique boundaries outside monogomous expectations of fidelity, that if violated are still considered cheating. [...] In particular because both men and women can have multiple partners, these individuals do not consider themselves to be either uncommitted or unfaithful (Ritchie and Barker, 2006).|$|E

Three genera with full or partial radial floral symmetry are found within tribes Gesnerieae and Gloxinieae of Gesneriaceae where the remaining taxa have bilaterally symmetrical flowers.
