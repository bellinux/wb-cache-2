25|$|The US Ambassador Cameron Munter {{found it}} {{difficult}} to counter the Anti-American sentiment in the country, especially after the Raymond Davis incident. The Anti-Americanism sentiment in Pakistan is one of the strongest in the world. The Anti-Americanism has risen as a result of U.S. military drone strikes introduced by President George W. Bush and continued by President Barack Obama as his counter-terrorism policy. As of present, almost 60%–80% of Pakistanis consider the United States as an enemy combatant state. The Anti-Americanism has been provoked mainly as a reaction <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> critical of American CIA activities in Pakistan, such as the infamous break-out of the Raymond Allen Davis incident and American intrusions from Afghanistan border such as the 2011 NATO attack in Pakistan. The credibility of Obama administration was undermined in the country and, furthermore, approximately 4 in 10 Pakistanis believe that U.S. military and economic aid is having a negative impact on their country; only 1 in 10 believes the impact has been positive. In 2010, Pakistan purchased 1,000 laser-guided bomb kits and 18 F-16 fighter jets from the US.|$|E
500|$|The New Yorker Anthony Lane {{criticized the}} plot, saying [...] "toss {{everything}} you can find, starting with roughly diced plots, into the blender: such {{appears to be the}} method behind Tower Heist." [...] Lane called the characters [...] "unlikable people" [...] but offered praise to Broderick, saying he [...] "underplays [...] so well." [...] Lane lamented that [...] "the notion of a theft from the thieves <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> lapped in lofty, screw-you wealth is a tempting one right now, but Tower Heist passes the buck." [...] Varietys Peter Debruge was also critical, saying the film [...] "goes wonky {{on the way to the}} bank, due to its lackluster pacing and shortage of the qualities that typically earn stars Ben Stiller and Eddie Murphy their paychecks – namely, laughs." [...] Debruge felt that the opening 40 minutes were [...] "a dull blue-collar drama populated entirely by stereotypes," [...] and while the film [...] "picks up some much-needed momentum" [...] with the actual heist, the [...] "resolution feels rushed." [...] However, Debruge echoed praise for Murphy, calling his performance [...] "a welcome return to the comic's irreverent, '80s-era persona," [...] and lamenting his limited screen-time.|$|E

2500|$|In contrast, {{the authors}} {{describe}} [...] "extractive" [...] institutions as ones that permit the elite to rule over and exploit others, extracting wealth <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{not in the}} elite. Nations {{with a history of}} extractive institutions have not prospered, they argue, because entrepreneurs and citizens have less incentive to invest and innovate. One reason is that ruling elites are afraid of creative destruction—a term coined by Austrian economist Joseph Schumpeter—the ongoing process of annihilating old and bad institutions while generating new and good ones. Creative destruction would fabricate new groups which competing for power against ruling elites, who would lose their exclusive access to a country's economic and financial resources.|$|E

2500|$|A simple example: Someone wants a big yacht {{but does}} not have the means to buy one. [...] If the person cannot exert {{self-control}}, (s)he might try to get the yacht (or the means for it) in an illegal way, whereas someone with high self-control will (more likely) either wait or deny themselves of what want or seek an intelligent intermediate solution, such as joining a yacht club to use a yacht by group consolidation of resources without violating social norms. Social bonds, through peers, parents, and others can have a countering effect on one's low self-control. [...] For families of low socio-economic status, a factor that distinguishes families with delinquent children <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not delinquent is the control exerted by parents or chaperonage. In addition, theorists such as David Matza and Gresham Sykes argued that criminals are able to temporarily neutralize internal moral and social behavioral constraints through techniques of neutralization.|$|E
2500|$|In 1884, Japan had {{encouraged}} a coup in Korea by a pro-Japanese reformist faction, {{which led to}} the conservative government calling upon China for help, leading to a clash between Chinese and Japanese soldiers in Seoul. At the time, Tokyo did not feel ready to risk a war with China, and the crisis was ended by the Treaty of Tintsin, which left Korea more strongly in the Chinese sphere of influence, though it did give the Japanese the right to intervene in Korea. All through the 1880s and early 1890s, the government in Tokyo was regularly criticized for not being aggressive enough in Korea, leading a Japanese historian Masao Maruyama to write: [...] "Just as Japan was subject to pressure from the Great Powers, so she would apply pressure to still weaker countries-a clear case of the transfer psychology. In this regard it is significant that ever since the Meiji period demands for a tough foreign policy have come from the common people, that is, <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> at the receiving end of oppression at home".|$|E

[...] On the other hand, [...] "When any have sins remaining upon the books of record, unrepented of and unforgiven, their names will be blotted out of the book of life, and the record of their good deeds will be erased from the book of God's remembrance."

2500|$|Other VTTI {{research}} {{based on}} naturalistic driving data {{has demonstrated that}} not all commercial vehicle drivers have an equal likelihood of experiencing “safety-critical events,” i.e., crashes, near-crashes, or high-risk events such as lane deviations. [...] One example is that drivers classified as obese {{were significantly more likely}} to be rated as fatigued, to be involved in a safety-critical event, and to be involved in safety-critical events related to fatigue. Another naturalistic driving study of local and short-haul truck drivers found that 8 of the 42 drivers in the study accounted for 60% of the 77 safety-critical events documented. In progress at VTTI is a case-control study that seeks to differentiate commercial drivers who are involved in a crash <b>from</b> <b>those</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> not according to individual and organizational characteristics. This line of research has implications to improve trucking safety by identifying attributes of higher-risk individuals and implementing controls to monitor and improve their safety performance. It can also identify high-risk organizational attributes amenable to changes in safety management practices.|$|E

2500|$|The casual {{format of}} Gacaca {{has led to}} many legal criticisms of the format which include the following: no right to a lawyer, no right to be presumed {{innocent}} until proven otherwise, no right to be informed of charges being brought against you, no right to case/defense preparation time, no {{right to be present}} at one's own trial, no right to confront witnesses, no right against self incrimination, no right against double jeopardy, no right against arbitrary arrest and detention, and furthermore, there is vast evidence of corruption among officials.
