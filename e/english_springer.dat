Numbers remain {{closer to the}} American Cocker Spaniel which registered 610 in 2000, and 599 in 2004. The breed remains more popular than some other breeds of Spaniel, including the Clumber Spaniel, Field Spaniel, Sussex Spaniel and Irish Water Spaniel. Total registrations in the UK during 2016 fell to 299 qualifying it to be included on The Kennel Club's list of Vulnerable Native Breeds.|$|E

5|$|Ectropion is {{the outward}} rolling of the eyelid, which {{abnormally}} exposes the eye, resulting in irritation. Because {{of the increased}} exposure, the dog can develop allergic or bacterial conjunctivitis or keratoconjunctivitis sicca also known as dry-eye syndrome. It is most commonly found in breeds with exaggerated facial features such as the Boxer, Bloodhound, Gordon Setter {{as well as the}} English and American Cocker Spaniels, and the <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|Entropion is the inward rolling {{of the eye}}lid, {{commonly}} {{the lower}} lid. This in turn irritates the cornea of the eye and can cause visual impairment.

5|$|The Welsh Springer Spaniel is a {{breed of}} dog {{and a member}} of the spaniel family. Thought to be {{comparable}} to the old Land Spaniel, they are similar to the <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel and historically have been referred to as both the Welsh Spaniel and the Welsh Cocker Spaniel. They were relatively unknown until a succession of victories in dog trials by the breed increased its popularity. Following recognition by The Kennel Club in 1902, the breed gained the modern name of Welsh Springer Spaniel. The breed's coat only comes in a single colour combination of white with red markings, usually in a piebald pattern. Loyal and affectionate, they can become very attached to family members and are wary of strangers. Health conditions are limited to those common among many breeds of dog, although they are affected more than average by hip dysplasia and some eye conditions. They are a working dog, bred for hunting, and while not as rare as some varieties of spaniel, they are rarer than the more widely known <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel with which they are sometimes confused.|$|E
5|$|Welsh Springers were {{recognised}} by The Kennel Club, {{after the}} breed had gained popularity, in 1902 {{under the new}} name of Welsh Springer Spaniel. Until then the breed was shown alongside the <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel. The Welsh Springer Spaniel was transported to America in the late 19th century and gained recognition by the American Kennel Club in 1906.|$|E
5|$|In the field, the AWS is less exuberant {{than the}} <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel, {{but it is}} as skilled in {{retrieval}} as Labrador or Golden Retriever. It is versatile regardless {{of the type of}} terrain, and in the water it is not the fastest swimmer but has a high level of endurance. The breed is also good at agility and flyball, with the first of the breed receiving a flyball championship title in 1993.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to examine whether Chinese {{dyslexic}} children had difficulties learning English as a second language given the distinctive characteristics of the two scripts. Twenty-five Chinese primary school children with developmental dyslexia and 25 normally achieving children were tested on a number of English vocabulary, reading, and phonological processing tasks. It was found that the Dyslexia group performed significantly worse than the Control group in nearly all the English measures. The findings suggest that Chinese dyslexic children also encounter difficulties in learning English as a second language, and they are generally weak in phonological processing both in Chinese and English. However, phonological skills were found to correlate significantly with English reading but not with Chinese reading in the dyslexic children. It is evident that there are both common and specific causes to reading difficulties in Chinese and <b>English.</b> © 2005 <b>Springer</b> Science+Business Media, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|The Norfolk Spaniel or Shropshire Spaniel is an extinct {{breed of}} dog {{since the early}} 20th century. It was {{originally}} thought to have originated {{from the work of}} one of the Dukes of Norfolk, but this theory was disproven after being in doubt during the later part of the 19th century. The term was used to designate springer type spaniels that were neither Sussex nor Clumber Spaniels, and attempts were made to use it to specify a breed that would later become known as the <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel.|$|E
5|$|With a liver-and-white or {{black-and-white}} coat, the Norfolk Spaniel {{was described}} as being a large cocker spaniel. The Spaniel Club set out a breed standard for Norfolk Spaniels, but specimens of the breed varied greatly across England. Members of the breed were difficult to train, but formed a strong attachment with their owners and were useful for hunting both on land and in water. The breed ceased to exist after 1903, when it was rolled into the new <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel breed created by The Kennel Club to contain all spaniels of this type.|$|E
5|$|In {{conformation}} showing, eyes {{should be}} brown in colour; yellow eyes do sometimes occur but are penalised {{in the show}} ring. Ears are small, pendulous (suspended and hanging), vine-shaped and with a light setter-like feathering. Nostrils are well developed and are black or any shade of brown; a pink nose is penalised in the AKC standard for the show ring, in Britain the colour is not specified in The Kennel Club's breed standard. In showing, a scissors bite is preferred with an undershot jaw severely penalised. Unlike the <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel and English Cocker Spaniel, there is no divergence into show and field styles of the breed.|$|E
5|$|The English Cocker Spaniel is {{the most}} {{successful}} breed at the most popular dog show in the UK, Crufts, with seven best-in-show wins since the prize was first awarded in 1928. This was mostly due {{to the success of}} dog breeder H.S. Lloyd's Ware Kennel, dogs of which won best-in-show on six occasions between 19301950. They are the second most popular dog breed in the UK according to statistics released by the KC with 22,211 registrations in 2009, beaten only by the Labrador Retriever with 40,943. In third place was the <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel with 12,700. The English Cocker's popularity has increased steadily since 1999 in the United States when they were ranked 76th in registrations by the AKC, to 2009 when they were ranked 66th.|$|E
5|$|The Field Spaniel {{remains a}} rare breed, {{even in the}} UK. In 2009, a total of 51 dogs were {{registered}} with The Kennel Club {{and has been in}} steady decline since 2000. Out of all the Spaniel breeds registered with The Kennel Club, the Field Spaniel has the lowest numbered registered year on year, with only the Sussex Spaniel coming a close second with 60 registrations in 2009. This is compared to the <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel with 12,700 and the English Cocker Spaniel with 22,211 registrations in 2009 alone. In order to promote the breed, they have been registered as a Vulnerable Native Breed by The Kennel Club.|$|E
5|$|The Russian Spaniel {{is a type}} of spaniel first {{standardised}} in 1951 in the Soviet Union after World War II by cross breeding English Cocker Spaniels, <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniels {{and other}} spaniel breeds. Physically it is similar to a Cocker Spaniel, but has a shorter, tighter coat and a longer body. Developed and used as hunting dogs, this breed does not suffer from any major health complaints other than those normally associated with spaniels. Popular in its native Russia, the breed was only introduced overseas in the 1990s, and is not yet recognised by any major kennel clubs.|$|E
5|$|The breed is robustly healthy {{with few}} issues and adapts well to wet weather conditions. A {{dermatological}} condition known as acral mutilation and analgesia may affect French Spaniels. It is a newly recognised disorder, with symptoms becoming apparent {{between three and}} a half months and a year of age. It was first reported in thirteen dogs in Canada and shares symptoms with the acral mutilation syndromes of the German Shorthaired Pointer, English Pointer and <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniels. Dogs who are affected will lick, bite and mutilate their extremities resulting in ulcers with secondary bacterial infections. Self amputation of claws, digits and footpads can happen in extreme cases. The majority of the initial dogs identified were euthanised within days to months of being diagnosed.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the 1870s, {{the only}} {{requirement}} {{for a dog}} to be classed as a Cocker Spaniel was that it needed to weigh less than , although breeders separated the cocker from the King Charles Spaniel which remains a smaller breed of spaniel. This maximum weight limit remained on the Cocker Spaniel until 1900, with larger dogs being classed as Springer Spaniels. The colors of the Devonshire and Welsh Cockers were described by John Henry Walsh under the pseudonym Stonehenge in his book The Dog in Health and Disease as being a deeper shade of liver {{than that of the}} Sussex Spaniel. Following the formation of The Kennel Club in the UK in 1873, efforts were made by breeders to record the pedigrees of cockers and springers. In 1892, English Cocker Spaniels and <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniels were recognized as separate breeds by The Kennel Club.|$|E
5|$|Welsh Springers can be {{prone to}} entropion, which is a {{disorder}} that affects the eyelids. The condition causes them to curl inwards, pressing the eyelashes against {{the surface of the}} eye itself and causing them to scratch it. This can lead to irritation and damage to the cornea. In most cases it only affects the lower eyelid on one or both eyes, but in some cases the upper eyelid can be affected as well. Symptoms can include tearing, squinting, the rubbing of the eyes, thick discharge from the eyes and rolling of the eyelid along with wetness on the hairs next to the eyelids. There is no medical treatment for entropion, and surgical correction may be necessary depending on the severity of the case. This condition may be present soon after birth, or later in life as a secondary condition to other eye related diseases or infections. Other breeds also affected by the condition include the Chow Chow, Great Dane, Golden Retriever and the <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel.|$|E
25|$|<b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniels tend to {{gain weight}} easily, and owners {{need to be careful}} about their food consumption.|$|E
25|$|The <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel has {{a typical}} {{lifespan}} of 10.5 to 15 years. As in most breeds, {{there are some}} health problems that {{are more likely to}} occur. Hip dysplasia and progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) (a degeneration of the retina causing vision loss leading to blindness) are two such diseases for which veterinarians are working on genetic markers to determine carriers. Another problem can be elbow dysplasia. Retinal dysplasia (RD), which can cause blindness and Phosphofructokinase deficiency (PFK), which is genetic deficiency which impairs the ability of cells using carbohydrates for energy are two other hereditary conditions for which both lines of the <b>English</b> <b>springer</b> spaniel should be screened prior to breeding. Health issues are usually similar in both types of <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> however phosphofructokinase deficiency in particular can appear more in field lines, however carriers in show lines have been identified.|$|E
25|$|An <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel is {{foremost}} an upland flushing dog. There are {{a number}} of skills that breeders train the dog to perform for their occupation.|$|E
25|$|The <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel {{is similar}} to the English Cocker Spaniel and at first glance the only major {{difference}} is the latter's smaller size. However English Springers also tend to have shorter, and higher-set ears than English Cockers. In addition Springers also tend to have a longer muzzle; their eyes are not as prominent, and the coat is less abundant. The major differences between the Welsh Springer and the <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> are that the Welsh have more limited colours and tend to be slightly smaller.|$|E
25|$|Bush {{was known}} for her affection for her pet <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel Millie and wrote a children's book about Millie's new litter of puppies. She even {{included}} Millie in her official white house portrait, painted by Candace Whittemore Lovely. Barbara Bush became the first U.S. First Lady to become a recipient of the Henry G. Freeman Jr. Pin Money Fund, receiving $36,000, most of which she gave to favorite charities.|$|E
25|$|In January 1899, the Spaniel Club of England and the Sporting Spaniel Society {{held their}} trials {{together}} for the first time. Three years later, in 1902, a combination of the physical standard from the Spaniel Club of England and the ability standard from the Sporting Spaniel Society led to the <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel breed being officially recognised by the English Kennel Club. The American Kennel Club followed in 1910. In 1914, the first English Field Champion was crowned, FTC Rivington Sam, whose dam was a registered cocker spaniel, Rivington Riband. Sam {{is considered one of the}} foundation sires for modern field lines.|$|E
25|$|The <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel is a {{medium-sized}} compact dog. Its coat is moderately long with feathering on {{the legs and}} tail. It is a well proportioned, balanced dog with a gentle expression and a friendly wagging tail. This breed represents perhaps the greatest divergence between working and show lines of any breed of dog. A field-bred dog and a show-bred dog appear to be different breeds, but are registered together. In fact, the gene pools are almost completely segregated and have been for at least 70 years. A field-bred dog would not be competitive in a modern dog show, while a show dog {{would not have the}} speed or stamina to succeed in a field trial.|$|E
500|$|The French Spaniel {{is one of}} the two tallest spaniel breeds, being {{taller than}} the <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel. Males can range in height from , and females are about an inch shorter. Dogs can range in weight from [...]|$|E
500|$|The Kennel Club (UK) {{designated}} all medium legged spaniels {{which were}} not Clumber nor Sussex Spaniels as <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniels in 1902. The Norfolk Spaniel was included under this designation, with the term [...] "Norfolk Spaniel" [...] considered for use to cover these types of spaniels, but ultimately rejected as the Club believed that the breed was always liver and white in colour. The change in terminology was not smooth or immediate, with James Watson in his 1905 work, The Dog Book, still referring to the Norfolk Spaniel as a breed name. In the modern era, the Norfolk Spaniel {{is thought to be}} the previous name for the <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel, prior to recognition by The Kennel Club (UK).|$|E
500|$|Welsh Springers {{are often}} {{confused}} with the <b>English</b> <b>Springer</b> Spaniel, but there are marked differences. The Welsh Springer is slightly smaller, and its reddish markings on a white background {{as opposed to the}} English Springers black or liver-coloured markings. Both breeds are admired for their hunting abilities and their trademark trait of [...] "springing" [...] at game. This can be seen during play also, as a dog may [...] "spring" [...] on his toy. [...] Some experts believe that the Welsh Springer Spaniel and the Brittany share the same ancestry as {{there is a great deal}} of resemblance between the two breeds.
