5|$|In 1966, {{criticism}} {{over the}} Johnson Administration's {{handling of the}} Vietnam War began to grow, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the 1966 midterm elections saw a 47-seat swing {{in favor of the}} Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further Great Society programs.|$|E
5|$|The {{improvement}} {{was only a}} temporary remission, and by late 1947, Ruth was unable {{to help with the}} writing of his autobiography, The Babe Ruth Story, which was almost entirely ghostwritten. In and out of the hospital in Manhattan, he left for Florida in February 1948, <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> activities he could. After six weeks he returned to New York to appear at a book-signing party. He also traveled to California to witness the filming of the book.|$|E
5|$|The {{sequences}} set in 2029 and the stop-motion {{scenes were}} developed by Fantasy II, a special effects company headed by Gene Warren Junior. A stop-motion model is used in several scenes in the film involving the Terminator's skeletal frame. Cameron wanted to convince the audience that {{the model of the}} structure was capable of <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> they saw Schwarzenegger doing. To allow this, a scene was filmed of Schwarzenegger injured and limping away; this limp made it easier for the model to imitate Schwarzenegger.|$|E

5|$|Herodotus {{tells us}} that, on seeing {{the outcome of}} the battle hung in the balance, the {{disarmed}} Samians had joined in {{on the side of the}} allies, <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> they could. This inspired the other Ionian contingents to turn on the Persians as well. At which stage in the battle this happened is not clear; the Samians were presumably not in the main battle line (being disarmed), so it may have been after the Persians retreated to the camp. Meanwhile, the Milesians who were guarding the passes of Mycale also turned on the Persians. At first they misdirected the fleeing Persian contingents so that they ended up back amongst the Allied troops; then, perhaps seeing {{the outcome of the}} battle was certain, they began killing the fleeing Persians.|$|E
5|$|A {{glassblower}} is {{attacked and}} hospitalized. Nemhauser (Greg Thirloway), another agent on the case, tells Scully that Patterson {{was responsible for}} getting Mulder assigned to the case and may admire him after all. Patterson finds Mulder in the library studying gargoyles; he tells Mulder that he's wasting his time and is a disappointment to him. Scully goes to Mulder's apartment and finds it covered with gargoyle drawings. Mulder, having sculpted a gargoyle himself in Mostow's studio before falling asleep, awakens to find a figure with a gargoyle-like face standing over him; he gives chase but is attacked, his face slashed with a utility knife. Mulder refuses to explain to Scully why he was in Mostow's studio. Scully confronts Patterson, who tells her not to try and stop Mulder from <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> he's doing, because she won't be able to. Mulder goes to see Mostow again, but Mostow will not tell him {{how to find the}} creature that attacked him.|$|E
5|$|During mid-1997, Jackson and Walsh {{began writing}} with Stephen Sinclair. Sinclair's partner, Philippa Boyens, {{was a major}} fan {{of the book and}} joined the writing team after reading their treatment. It took 13–14 months to write the two film scripts, which were 147 and 144 pages respectively. Sinclair left the project due to {{theatrical}} obligations. Amongst their revisions, Sam is caught eavesdropping and forced to go along with Frodo, instead of Sam, Merry, and Pippin figuring out about the One Ring themselves and voluntarily going along after confronting Frodo about it, as occurs in the original novel. Gandalf's account of his time at Orthanc was pulled out of flashback and Lothlórien was cut, with Galadriel <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> she does in the story at Rivendell. Denethor attends the Council with his son. Other changes included having Arwen rescue Frodo, and the action sequence involving the cave troll. The writers also considered having Arwen absorb Éowyn's role entirely by having her kill the Witch-king.|$|E

5|$|This {{behaviour}} {{appears at}} first to be an evolutionary paradox, since helping others costs precious resources and decreases one's own fitness. Previously, many had interpreted this as an aspect of group selection: individuals are <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> {{is best for the}} survival of the population or species as a whole. British evolutionary biologist W. D. Hamilton used gene-frequency analysis in his inclusive fitness theory to show how hereditary altruistic traits can evolve if there is sufficient genetic similarity between actors and recipients of such altruism (including close relatives). Hamilton's inclusive fitness has since been successfully applied {{to a wide range of}} organisms, including humans. Similarly, Robert Trivers, thinking in terms of the gene-centred model, developed the theory of reciprocal altruism, whereby one organism provides a benefit to another in the expectation of future reciprocation. Dawkins popularised these ideas in The Selfish Gene, and developed them in his own work. In June 2012 Dawkins was highly critical of fellow biologist E.O. Wilson's 2012 book The Social Conquest of Earth as misunderstanding Hamilton's theory of kin selection. Dawkins has also been strongly critical of the Gaia hypothesis of the independent scientist James Lovelock.|$|E
5|$|He also {{missed the}} {{opportunity}} to lead the original Sinister Six because he felt that joining the group would mean admitting he needed the help of others to rid himself of Spider-Man. Although he later formed the 'Sinister Twelve' when Spider-Man sent him to prison, he expressed anger at Mac Gargan for acquiring the Venom symbiote rather than using the new Scorpion suit provided for him simply because Gargan was not <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> he wanted, despite Venom being {{more powerful than the}} Scorpion. When he participated in the mystical ritual known as the Gathering of Five, he appeared convinced that he would automatically receive the gift of power from the ritual– which would bestow upon the participants power, immortality, knowledge, madness and death, respectively– only to receive the gift of madness instead, subsequently requiring an elaborate cocktail of drugs to restore himself to a semblance of sanity. During his time in charge of H.A.M.M.E.R. he was provoked into attacking Asgard by his Goblin side because his ego couldn't allow himself to consider the possibility that the Asgardians wouldn't threaten his power. Later events revealed that Loki at least slightly influenced Osborn's decision to further Loki's own goals. During his attempted takeover of Earth's superhuman security defenses, he was shown reflecting that humans are all barbarians who require the strong like him to control them, dismissing the Avengers as no better than him despite the obvious distinction between Osborn's demands for power and the straightforward respect that the general public have for the Avengers.|$|E
5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how to do these things. Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} to do these things when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for <b>doing</b> <b>what</b> is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E
