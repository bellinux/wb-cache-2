40|$|In {{order to}} improve the <b>electric</b> {{conductivity}} and <b>tap</b> density of lithium iron phosphate, CaB 6 {{was used as a}} new additive for the first time. LiFePO 4 was synthesized by solid sate reaction and LiFePO 4 /CaB 6 composite with different contents of CaB 6 was prepared by two different methods. The samples were characterized by granularity, morphology, <b>electric</b> conductivity, <b>tap</b> density, X-ray diffraction and charge-discharge performance. The results show that although the specific capacity of these materials doped with CaB 6 was not improved significantly, the tap density and electronic conductivity of these composites increased. The samples synthesized by the second method exhibit much better performance, and the electronic conductivity of the materials is enhanced by five orders of magnitude and the tap density by 65 %...|$|R

50|$|Some of the {{techniques}} used by the inmates were ingenious and not too dissimilar {{to those in the}} war film The Great Escape about Allied POWs. Excavating the tunnels was not easy because of the heavy clay soil upon which the camp was built. Cans, meat tins, and even knives from the canteen were used as digging implements. The soil was hauled out of the tunnel on a makeshift skip and put into kit bags. At first, prisoners carried the soil in their pockets to the long-jump pit or garden plots. Others kneaded clay into balls and dropped them through a hole in a false wall they had constructed in an unused room in one of the huts. To support the tunnel roof, oak benches were stolen from the canteen and bed legs were cut down when supplies of wood were depleted. A ventilation pipeline was made from condensed milk tins; air was forced through by a hand-operated fan. The tunnel even had its own <b>electric</b> lights, <b>tapped</b> off the mains supply. Noise was concealed by chorus singing.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Capacitive divider {{systems for}} <b>tapping</b> <b>electric</b> power from high voltage {{transmission}} lines {{are known to}} exhibit certain detrimental problems of stability, sub-resonance harmonic oscillations, and ferroresonance when coupled with non-linear loads. On the other hand, they can improve reactive power flow, power factor and contribute to improved harmonic filtration of the larger power system. This paper, therefore, proposes a controlled power flow conditioner as an essential integral component of a capacitive divider system to control power transfer between the high voltage transmission line, capacitive divider system, and the load. The ultimate objective of this conditioner is to mitigate or minimize the attendant problems associated with coupling the system to the load, and optimize the derivable benefits to the larger network...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{developments}} in our laboratory related to polymer-based light sensors are reviewed. The inherent processibility {{of the active}} polymer medium is utilized {{in the implementation of}} different designs for the opto-electronic applications. The utility of these devices as sensitive photodetectors, image sensors and position sensitive detectors is demonstrated. The schottky-type layer formation at interfaces of polymers such as polyalkylthiophenes and aluminum accompanied by the enhanced photo-induced charge separation due to high local <b>electric</b> field is <b>tapped</b> for some of these device structures. The sensitivity of polymer-based field effect transistors to light also provides a convenient lateral geometry for efficient optical-coupling and control of the transistor state. ne range of these polymer-detectors available with the option of operating in the diode and transistor modes should be an attractive feature for many potential applications...|$|R

50|$|The EP {{is notable}} for only using sounds {{made by an}} <b>electric</b> guitar, from <b>tapping</b> on the pickups for drums, to {{detuning}} the guitar for bass. The album was recorded in Jeff Holt's basement studio while Satriani was a guitar teacher in Berkeley, California {{and a member of}} a band called The Squares. The EP was reviewed by Guitar Player magazine which had no knowledge that Satriani was ever in a typical band. The review, which treated Satriani as a purely instrumental guitarist, inspired him to pursue instrumental guitar playing as a career. However, the EP was not sufficient to secure a recording contract. Satriani used a credit card to finance his first full album, Not of This Earth, and used that finished album to secure a distribution contract with Relativity Records.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Electric {{power may}} be tapped {{straight}} from the high voltage transmission lines either for consumption {{to meet the needs}} of rural and remote areas, and telecommunication establishments located in remote sites; or as a scheme to enhance the capacity of another utility or grid along a trans-national or trans-continental transmission corridor. The importance and interests the technologies to accomplish this has generated necessitate the need for a review of the state of the art of this subject so as to delimit research actions and allow research interests to be appropriately promulgated. This paper therefore reviews, in two parts, the state of the art of <b>tapping</b> <b>electric</b> power from HV and EHV ac and dc transmission lines. Part one focuses on the general conditions for tapping, presents the principles on which tapping methods are based, reviews methods for tapping from HVAC transmission systems, and concludes with a general discussion on tapping from HVAC. The companion paper completes the study, by presenting the part two of the work...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn {{adherent}} and motile neutrophils NAD(P) H concentration, flavoprotein redox potential, {{and production}} of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide, are all periodic and exhibit defined phase relationships to an underlying metabolic oscillation of ∼ 20 s. Utilizing fluorescence microscopy, we have shown in real-time, on the single cell level, {{that the system is}} sensitive to externally applied periodically pulsed weak magnetic fields matched in frequency to the metabolic oscillation. Depending upon the phase relationship of the magnetic pulses to the metabolic oscillation, the magnetic pulses serve to either increase the amplitude of the NAD(P) H and flavoprotein oscillations, and the rate of production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide or, alternatively, collapse the metabolic oscillations and curtail production of reactive oxygen species and nitric oxide. Significantly, we demonstrate that the cells do not directly respond to the magnetic fields, but instead are sensitive to the electric fields which the pulsed magnetic fields induce. These weak <b>electric</b> fields likely <b>tap</b> into an endogenous signaling pathway involving calcium channels in the plasma membrane. We estimate that the threshold which induced electric fields must attain to influence cell metabolism is of the order of 10 − 4 V/m...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} and evaluate a methodology {{to assess and}} ensure Indoor Environment Qualities (IEQ) in buildings, during program, design and management phases. Different tools are proposed to collect input for assessment and to structure decision making in planning process. The methodology to assess IEQ is developed {{as part of the}} development of a broader environmental assessment method for real estates, EcoEffect. In 1998 - 1999 methodology to assess IEQ was developed and tested in three groups of existing multi-family houses and in 2000 - 2001 during the program and design of three multi-family building projects, planned for the exhibition Bo 01 in Malmö, Sweden. The methodology is designed to sum up assessment as two different aspects of IEQ. One reflecting an estimated risk of getting health problems from the building, the other giving an assessment value of the following IE Factors: Indoor Air Quality, Thermal comfort, Sound- and Lighting conditions, <b>Electric</b> environment, <b>Tap</b> water quality and Surface layer quality. Ten main groups of health problems are taken into account; Comfort problems, Intensified joint annoyance due to draught, Sleeping problems due to noise, Eye problems due to poor lighting, SBS (Sick Building Syndrome), Intensified allergy, Cancer, Infections, Enhanced sensitivity to the environment and Other uncommon health problems, like poisoning or reproduction injuries. A systematic and standardised questionnaire to evaluate tenants perception of health impacts is used when assessing existing buildings. Technical measurements are used when necessary, e. g. when estimating the risk for lung cancer due to radon in indoor air. The assessment methodology is based on multi-criteria analyse, development of different hierarchies for different assessment situations and simple additive weighting of criteria. The detailed questions about perceived environment, designed and used in the questionnaire, are appointed to have a central position (as standardised indoor problems, like "Smells mould", "Draught from windows") also when formulating and structuring criteria for assessing planned buildings. They are used as a common category when arranging connections between the hierarchies of the different assessment situations. During the program phase they are used as a base for organising indoor environment parameters and in the design phase the performance of building parts and products. When going from the assessment of health problems to the assessment of indoor environment factors the indoor problems are reorganised in a different pattern. This is the method used to incorporate experiences from the management phase to the planning phase. The thesis is written in Swedish, with a 6 pages summary in English...|$|R
5000|$|The {{application}} called [...] "Moon" [...] {{works as}} a music sequencer, using a string of little pearls linked to a central spine topped by a moon, the user can decide whether to play the original version of the song or to modify it by rotating the pearls to adjust the notes. Rotating the moon would instead modify the number of notes that are played in the sequence. The user can then decide to save the composition, to load one already saved beforehand, to reset the song or to play the original version. Similarly to the [...] "Moon" [...] app, the [...] "Solstice" [...] application {{works as a}}n instrument, in which the user can pull strings out of a central sun, create orbits around the sun and rotating planets by touching the screen and using the planets to pluck the strings {{like it was a}} harp. The user can also change the direction and speed of the planets and create multiple layers of orbits. The instrument can also be played in [...] "tree" [...] mode, where the system would stretch to become a tree. The [...] "Sacrifice" [...] app features a keyboard that allows the user to type letters linked to different snippets of the song. Both these two latter applications allow players to save or load their composition. In the [...] "Thunderbolt" [...] app, the user can create <b>electric</b> sparks by <b>tapping</b> their fingers on a black screen, or create an arpeggio, depicted by an electrical line, by using two or more fingers at the same time, to compose arpeggios while Björk sings the song or independently. The player can also adjust the fade time and the drawing length of the lightnings.|$|R
60|$|But I {{must not}} {{get away from}} my {{personal}} experiences in these international statistics. Sometimes, when night overtakes us, we stop and camp beside the road, and set about getting our supper of eggs and bread and butter and cheese, or the fruits that are ripening all round us. Since my experience with that pullet I go meekly mushrooming {{in the fields and}} pastures; and when I have set the mushrooms stewing over an open fire, Aristides makes the coffee, and in a little while we have a banquet fit for kings--or for the poor things in every grade below them that serve kings, political or financial or industrial. There is always water, for it is brought down from the snow-fields of the mountains--there is not much rainfall--and carried in little concrete channels along the road--side from village to village, something like those conduits the Italian peasants use to bring down the water from the Maritime Alps to their fields and orchards; and you hear the soft gurgle of it the whole night long, and day long, too, whenever you stop. After supper we can read awhile by our <b>electric</b> lamp (we <b>tap</b> the current in the telephone wires anywhere), or Aristides sacrifices himself to me in a lesson of Altrurian grammar. Then we creep back into our van and fall asleep with the Southern Cross glittering over our heads. It is perfectly safe, though {{it was a long time}} before I could imagine the perfect safety of it. In a country where there are no thieves, because a thief here would not know what to do with his booty, we are secure from human molestation, and the land has long been cleared of all sorts of wild beasts, without being unpleasantly tamed. It is like England in that, and yet it has a touch of the sylvan, which you feel nowhere as you do in our dear New England hill country. There was one night, however, when we were lured on and on, and did not stop to camp till fairly in the dusk. Then we went to sleep without supper, for we had had rather a late lunch and were not hungry, and about one o'clock in the morning I was awakened by voices speaking Altrurian together. I recognized my husband's voice, which is always so kind, but which seemed to have a peculiarly tender and compassionate note in it now. The other was lower and of a sadness which wrung my heart, though I did not know in the least what the person was saying. The talk went on a long time, at first about some matter of immediate interest, as I fancied, and then apparently it branched off on some topic which seemed to concern the stranger, whoever he was. Then it seemed to get more indistinct, as if the stranger were leaving us and Aristides were going a little way with him. Presently I heard him coming back, and he put his head in at the van curtains, as if to see whether I was asleep.|$|R
