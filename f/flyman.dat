6000|$|He next {{wrote me}} {{the address of}} the person from whom he had hired the fly, and handed me Sir Percival's letter. It was dated from Hampshire on the 25th of July, and it {{announced}} the journey of [...] "Lady Glyde" [...] to London on the 26th. Thus, on the very day (the 25th) when the doctor's certificate declared that she had died in St. John's Wood, she was alive, by Sir Percival's own showing, at Blackwater--and, on the day after, she was to take a journey! When the proof of that journey was obtained from the <b>flyman,</b> the evidence would be complete.|$|E
60|$|He {{was showing}} the Club to his family. He had 'brought them thither in the light-blue fly, {{waiting at the}} Club door; with Mrs. Chuff's hobbadehoy footboy on the box, {{by the side of}} the <b>flyman,</b> in a sham livery. Nelson Collingwood; pretty Mrs. Sackville; Mrs. Captain Chuff (Mrs. Commodore Chuff we call her), were all there; the latter, of course, in the {{vermilion}} tabinet, which, splendid as it is, is nothing in comparison to the splendour of the 'Sarcophagus.' The delighted Sackville Maine was pointing out the beauties of the place to them. It seemed as beautiful as Paradise to that little party.|$|E
60|$|The <b>flyman</b> {{touched his}} hat, turned the horse, and drove back as directed. When {{he was out}} of sight, the gentleman walked on, but he had not gone far before the rain again came down pitilessly, though of this the {{pedestrian}} took little heed, going leisurely onward till he reached Laura's park gate, which he passed through. The clouds were thick and the days were short, so that by the time he {{stood in front of the}} mansion it was dark. In addition to this his appearance, which on alighting from the carriage had been untarnished, partook now of the character of a drenched wayfarer not too well blessed with this world's goods. He halted for no more than a moment at the front entrance, and going round to the servants' quarter, as if he had a preconceived purpose in so doing, there rang the bell. When a page came to him he inquired if they would kindly allow him to dry himself by the kitchen fire.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{comparative study of}} regulating policies for interruption of supply in Sweden and UK. The two regulating regimes have been applied for a case study with a real rural electrical distribution system in Sweden, <b>Flymen.</b> The Swedish and UK regulations state that the distribution system operators (DSO) should restore power delivery to customers within 12 and 18 hours respectively for normal weather conditions. If this could not be fulfilled the DSOs are opposed to different predetermined penalty payments to the customers. In a comparative case study of <b>Flymen</b> the Swedish model (GL) gives a 68 % higher compensation to customers than the UK model (GS) for a 30 hours interruption of supply during normal weather conditions. Historical interruption data for the same system gives a 75 % higher compensation with the Swedish model (GL) than the UK model (GS). The main conclusion from the comparative study is that the Swedish GL model provides a higher compensation for interruptions of supply to customers than the UK GS model. QC 2010112...|$|R
5000|$|Whistling {{has long}} {{been used as a}} {{specialized}} communication between laborers. For example, whistling in theatre, particularly on-stage, is used by <b>flymen</b> (i.e. members of a fly crew) to cue the lowering or raising of a batten pipe or flat. This method of communication became popular before the invention of electronic means of communication, and is still in use, primarily in older [...] "hemp" [...] houses during the set and strike of a show.|$|R

60|$|Instead {{of having}} any quiet after the retreat of the ladies, {{the house was}} kept in a rattle, and the glasses jingled on the table as the <b>flymen</b> and coachmen plied the knocker, and the soiree came in. From my place I could see everything: the guests as they arrived (I remarked very few carriages, mostly cabs and flies), and a little crowd of blackguard boys and children, who were formed round the door, and gave ironical cheers to the folks as they stepped out of their vehicles.|$|R
60|$|The party {{entered the}} carriage, {{and the crowd}} of little boys and girls, <b>flymen</b> and porters, got up another 'hurrah!' as the four horses went thundering off, with Mrs. Frost apologizing--'Poor Oliver's notions were on such a grand scale!--He {{had been so long}} absent, {{that he did not know}} how much these things had been disused.' But no one could look at her bright tearful eyes, and quivering mouth, without seeing that she exulted in her son's affection and his victory; and after all it was natural to her, and a {{resumption}} of old habits.|$|R
5000|$|Scenically the production, {{designed}} by Harry Horner, was extremely involved with velour covered hard wall sets instead of typical muslin flats. The raised stage platform floor concealed tracks {{for the various}} platform wagon sets to be winched on and off stage. The village set, included left and right store facades with false perspective awnings, were stored, hanging in the off stage loft areas, allowing wing storage for the hard wall throne room (painted deep maroon color); a pink boudoir set; a garden set; and a Cathedral Rose stained glass window-wall with a central enlarged double Gothic arched doorway mounted on a six foot deep by thirty foot wide wagon platform. Staging the wedding scene, the couple began their walk {{at the rear of}} the stage on the Cathedral steps into the set. As the couple proceeded walking forward down to the foot-light apron, this massive Cathedral wall followed, moving with the couple to the middle of the stage. Interesting is fact the audience never realized that the set was moving downstage with the performers. When the couple turned around, returning upstage, the cathedral wall slowly returned to the back wall position ending the wedding scene. This set wagon wall flew out and was stored against the Curran's stage back wall; a spectacular visual transition, which was never seen by the audience! In Los Angeles, this set piece was replaced with a painted velour framed backing. Harry Horner matched Miles White's costume color, for Princess Flavia's dressing gown robe, spraying the velour boudoir walls the identical costume's pink color. During rehearsals, Miles was jump'n mad with Harry because all you could see was the actress' head bobbing in the identical pink background! The production required a large staff of stage technicians, <b>flymen,</b> and property crew for the major set changes. During the construction of the stage sets, the shop's minimum construction floor space limited and hindered by space for constructing all the wagon sets. The Light Opera rented film stages at the nearby (closed) Allied Artist Studios, located off Sunset Boulevard (KCET TV purchased the property afterwards). Only six blocks travel, carpenters and scenic artists assembled the scenery in two stages at the old film lot. Preparing the dry tint powder base paint for the throne room set, the Scenic charge man did not calculate the correct amount of [...] "horse glue" [...] binder for the dark maroon paint. Spraying the cream velour covered flats, after drying, the paint did not properly adhere to the velour flats. The result, the paint flaked and stained the stage technicians' hands. Each piece of scenery had to have a muslin case for shipping, keeping the finish from marking and affecting the other pieces of scenery. When this set was handled, each stage technician had to wear gloves when the set was moved into place, or shifted off stage for storage. This set remained a problem throughout the tour. Another folding deminsional scenic arch unit, which had been intended to fold open, and collapse when flown into grid storage position returning into the loft storage areas, became an engineering nightmare. The scenic element, abandoned after two weeks, was replaced by a flat profile garden arch. Harry Horner's scenery and Miles White's costumes provided an intricate, beautiful, handsome detailed production. Film sets and costumes as a stage musical! ...|$|R
