Transformation is a complex developmental process requiring energy and is dependent on expression of numerous genes. In S. pneumoniae at least 23 genes are required for transformation. In order for a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA</b> into its chromosome it must enter a special physiological state called competence.|$|E

500|$|Some {{bacteria}} also transfer {{genetic material}} between cells. This {{can occur in}} three main ways. First, bacteria can take up <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA</b> from their environment, in a process called transformation. [...] Genes can also be transferred {{by the process of}} transduction, when the integration of a bacteriophage introduces foreign DNA into the chromosome. [...] The third method of gene transfer is conjugation, whereby DNA is transferred through direct cell contact.|$|E
2500|$|Naturally {{competent}} bacteria carry sets {{of genes}} {{that provide the}} protein machinery to bring DNA across the cell membrane(s). [...] The transport of the <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA</b> into the cells may require proteins {{that are involved in}} the assembly of type IV pili and type II secretion system, as well as DNA translocase complex at the cytoplasmic membrane.|$|E
2500|$|The {{efficiency}} {{with which}} a competent culture {{can take up}} <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA</b> and express its genes is known as transformation efficiency and is measured in colony forming unit (cfu) per μg DNA used.

30|$|In {{the design}} of new gene {{regulatory}} materials, the following characteristics must be considered. First, either high target selectivity or universal availability is required. One {{of the reasons that}} RNA-based gene regulation methods such as siRNA or antisense RNA are attracting attention is because targeted mRNAs specifically react through complementary base hybridization. This not only improves the whole system efficiency by reducing possible off-target gene regulation, but also helps to reduce any side effects such as damage of <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNAs.</b> In addition, it is necessary to regulate many genes at the same time through only one single system. This will be an important characteristic for commercialization of the system by increasing the application in whole-system gene regulation while reducing the total price.|$|R

2500|$|Natural {{transformation}} is a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer {{that depends on}} the expression of numerous bacterial genes whose products appear to be responsible for this process. [...] In general, {{transformation is}} a complex, energy-requiring developmental process. [...] In order for a bacterium to bind, take up and recombine <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA</b> into its chromosome, it must become competent, that is, enter a special physiological state. [...] Competence development in Bacillus subtilis requires expression of about 40 genes. The DNA integrated into the host chromosome is usually (but with rare exceptions) derived from another bacterium of the same species, and is thus homologous to the resident chromosome.|$|E
2500|$|Conditions in {{the oral}} cavity are diverse and complex, {{frequently}} changing from one extreme to another. [...] Thus, to survive {{in the oral}} cavity, S. mutans must tolerate rapidly harsh environmental fluctuations and exposure to various antimicrobial agents to survive. Transformation is a bacterial adaptation involving the transfer of DNA from one bacterium to another through the surrounding medium. [...] Transformation is a primitive form of sexual reproduction. [...] For a bacterium to bind, take up, and recombine <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA</b> into its chromosome, it must enter a special physiological state termed “competence”. [...] In S. mutans, a peptide pheromone quorum-sensing signaling system controls genetic competence. This system functions optimally when the S. mutans cells are in crowded biofilms. S. mutans cells growing in a biofilm are transformed at a rate 10- to 600-fold higher than single cells growing under uncrowded conditions (planktonic cells). Induction of competence appears to be an adaptation for repairing DNA damage caused by crowded, stressful conditions.|$|E

The fractionated chromatin was assayed for DNA-dependent DNA polymerase (DNA mucleotidyl transferase EC 2. 7. 7. 7) activity {{with and without}} <b>exogenous</b> activated <b>DNA</b> serving as template. With endogenous chromatin as template, {{it was found that}} 90 % of the endogenous chromatin bound DNA polymerase activity was located in the transcriptionally active fraction of chromatin, while the distribution of DNA polymerase assayed with <b>exogenous</b> activated <b>DNA</b> was found to be 65 % in the transcriptionally active and 35 % in the inactive fractions. However, when DNA polymerase was solubilized from these fractions by salt extraction, enzyme activity was found to be equally distributed, suggesting that the difference in endogenous DNA polymerase activity observed between eu- and heterochromatin is due to the restricted template found in repressed fractions...|$|R
40|$|Artificial nonviral gene vectors {{have the}} {{potential}} to improve the safety of gene therapy; however, such artificial vectors are less efficient for gene expression due to the existence of various barriers to delivery of <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNAs</b> to the nucleus in the living cell. Here we describe the degradation activities of cytoplasmic nucleases, which are involved as a barrier to efficient exogenous gene expression. The size and structure of degraded DNA were monitored by fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) and fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (FCCS) in solution and in the cytoplasm of living cells. Differences in degradation by endo- and exonucleases were confirmed by differences in the size and structure of DNA. Moreover, we confirmed the influence of the exonuclease degradation in cytoplasm on the expression rate of DNA transfection with a cationic lipid. Based on a comparison of in vitro and cell measurements, we conclude that cytoplasmic degradation by exonucleases can be a considerable barrier against efficient gene delivery...|$|R

2500|$|It is {{impossible}} to determine the initial cause for most specific cancers. [...] In a few cases, only one cause exists; for example, the virus HHV-8 causes all Kaposi's sarcomas. [...] However, {{with the help of}} cancer epidemiology techniques and information, it is possible to produce an estimate of a likely cause in many more situations. [...] For example, lung cancer has several causes, including tobacco use and radon gas. [...] Men who currently smoke tobacco develop lung cancer at a rate 14 times that of men who have never smoked tobacco, so the chance of lung cancer in a current smoker being caused by smoking is about 93%; there is a 7% chance that the smoker's lung cancer was caused by radon gas or some other, non-tobacco cause. [...] These statistical correlations have made it possible for researchers to infer that certain substances or behaviors are carcinogenic. Tobacco smoke causes increased <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA</b> damage, and these DNA damages are the likely cause of lung cancer due to smoking. Among the more than 5,000 compounds in tobacco smoke, the genotoxic DNA damaging agents that occur both at the highest concentrations and which have the strongest mutagenic effects are acrolein, formaldehyde, acrylonitrile, 1,3-butadiene, acetaldehyde, ethylene oxide and isoprene.|$|E
2500|$|DNA {{damage is}} {{considered}} to be the primary underlying cause of malignant neoplasms known as cancers. [...] Its central role in progression to cancer is illustrated in the figure in this section, in the box near the top. (The central features of DNA damage, epigenetic alterations and deficient DNA repair in progression to cancer are shown in red.) [...] DNA damage is very common. [...] Naturally occurring DNA damages (mostly due to cellular metabolism and the properties of DNA in water at body temperatures) occur at a rate of more than 60,000 new damages, on average, per human cell, per day [...] [...] Additional DNA damages can arise from exposure to exogenous agents. [...] Tobacco smoke causes increased <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA</b> damage, and these DNA damages are the likely cause of lung cancer due to smoking. UV light from solar radiation causes DNA damage that is important in melanoma. Helicobacter pylori infection produces high levels of reactive oxygen species that damage DNA and contributes to gastric cancer. Bile acids, at high levels in the colons of humans eating a high fat diet, also cause DNA damage and contribute to colon cancer. Katsurano et al. indicated that macrophages and neutrophils in an inflamed colonic epithelium are the source of reactive oxygen species causing the DNA damages that initiate colonic tumorigenesis. [...] Some sources of DNA damage are indicated in the boxes {{at the top of the}} figure in this section.|$|E
5000|$|The {{method for}} SMGT uses the sperm cell, a natural vector of genetic material, to {{transport}} <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA.</b> The <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules bind {{to the cell}} membrane {{of the head of}} the sperm cell. This binding and internalization of the DNA is not a random event. The <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA</b> interacts with the DNA-binding proteins (DBPs) that are present {{on the surface of the}} sperm cell.3 Spermatozoa are naturally protected against the intrusion of <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA</b> molecules by an inhibitory factor present in mammals’ seminal fluid. This factor blocks the binding of sperm cells and <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA</b> because in the presence of the inhibitory factor, DBPs lose their ability to bind to <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA.</b> In the absence of this inhibitory factor, DBPs on sperm cells are able to interact with DNA and can then translocate the DNA into the cell. Therefore, the seminal fluid must be removed from the sperm samples by extensive washing immediately after ejaculation.3 After the DNA is internalized, the <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA</b> must be integrated into the genome. There are various mechanisms suggested for DNA integration, including integrating DNA at oocyte activation, at nucleus decondensation, or at the formation of the pronulcei, but all of these suggested mechanisms imply that the integration of DNA happens after the penetration of the sperm cell into the oocyte.3 ...|$|E

In one study, CPPs TP and TP10 were coupled to NFкB decoy DNA, which blocked the effect of interleukin-1-induced NFкB activation and IL-6 gene expression. In another study, TP10 coupled Myc decoy DNA decreased proliferative capacity of N2a cells.|$|R
40|$|Herpes simplex virus {{thymidine}} kinase gene and pBR 322 DNA (in large excess to the {{thymidine kinase}} gene) were introduced into mouse L cells by calcium phosphate DNA-mediated gene transfer. DNA fragments encompassing six junctions between the <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNAs</b> have been cloned and their nucleotide sequences determined. Analysis of these sequences {{has shown that}} stretches of partial homology involving from 20 - 50 base pairs are present near the points at which joining occurs between the donor molecules. The structure of the junction sequences suggests that the recombination event involves the alignment of the two donor DNA molecules at partially homologous regions followed by staggered cutting and joining. One donor molecule is always cut {{in the region of}} partial homology, while the second is cut at some distance that is a small multiple of 13. 5 +/- 0. 5 base pairs away (at 0, 14, 27, 39, 41, and 54 base pairs). In the three junctions where the second cut is far from the region of homology, a 17 - to 19 -base-pair segment of DNA separates the donor sequences. In all cases the origin of this "filler" DNA appears to be oligonucleotides derived from pBR 322...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} that the presence of double-strand breaks or double-strand gaps increases the frequency of homologous recombination between two cotransferred DNAs when they are introduced into cultured mammalian cells. Here we demonstrate that the repair of these double-strand gaps is a major mechanism for homologous recombination between <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNAs.</b> In particular, when a plasmid DNA containing a 104 -base-pair (bp) gap in its tk gene (herpes simplex virus gene for thymidine kinase) undergoes recombination in mouse L cells to generate an intact gene, the majority of events result from direct repair of the double-strand gap using a cotransferred DNA as the template. We analyzed the recombination events by comparing the frequency of tk+ colonies, Southern blotting of cloned tk+ cell lines, and cloning recombined functional tk genes by plasmid rescue. In addition, by creating double-strand breaks within or adjacent to heterologous insertions in a mutant tk gene, we estimate that the L cell can generate a double-strand gap of between 152 and 248 bp and then can repair the gap to create a functional tk gene. We conclude that double-strand breaks and double-strand gaps are recombinogenic in transferred plasmid DNAs because they serve as intermediates in homologous recombination by double-strand gap repair, a nonreciprocal exchange of DNA or gene conversion event...|$|R
50|$|Sperm-mediated gene {{transfer}} (SMGT) is a transgenic technique that transfers genes {{based on the}} ability of sperm cells to spontaneously bind to and internalize <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA</b> and transport it into an oocyte during fertilization to produce genetically modified animals.1 <b>Exogenous</b> <b>DNA</b> refers to DNA that originates outside of the organism.

50|$|Coprinopsis cinerea can be {{transformed}} with <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA</b> by transformation when the fungus is a protoplast. It was found that disrupting (knockout or RNAi silencing) ku70 homologue can increase gene targeting via increased homologous recombination. Either protoplasts derived from oidia or vegetative mycelium can be used, however, gene targeting {{was found to be}} higher by 2% (based on phenotyping) when using vegetative mycelium. Otherwise, insertion of integrative vectors ectopically and with small homologous regions can be used, likely with low transformation efficiency. Earlier, REMI (restriction enzyme-mediated integration) could be used to insert <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA</b> into the chromosome to produce mutant strains. This relies on inserting <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA</b> and restriction enzymes into the protoplast cell, allowing for the enzymes to cut the chromosome at specific sites which match those sites used to produce linearized plasmid DNA with the gene of interest; subsequently, host enzymes ligate the cut sites and thus produce integrated heterologous, <b>exogenous</b> <b>DNA.</b> Although successful, undesirable mutations are likely. Chemical mutagenesis (also random) can also be done. Phenotype selection of the inability to fruit can indict that insertion led to disruption of vital genes. All in all, homologous recombination provides more specificity when creating a mutant strain. Depending on the mutant, auxotrophy markers (requires lost gene to be inserted) or prototrophy (when causing essential gene deletion) be used for selection.|$|E
