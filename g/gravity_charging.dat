Specifically, in contrast to an initial singularity, an initial energy continuum in {{an infinite number of}} dimensions is assumed. In response to a dimensional catastrophe, a subset of the energy continuum was confined to three spatial dimensions thereby initiating dimensional boundary conditions leading to the gradual quantization of phase space. It is then proposed that this initial quantization of phase space led to the Second Law of Thermodynamics and the statistical flow of time. In addition, the appearance of fundamental quantities such as mass (and, hence, <b>gravity),</b> <b>charge</b> and spin can then be explained as a natural consequence of the Second Law of Thermodynamics.

First, we construct perturbative black hole solutions in a recently proposed model of Einsteinian cubic gravity in five dimensions, and compute the Rényi entropy as well as the scaling dimension of the twist operators in the dual field theory. Consistency of these results are verified from the AdS/CFT correspondence, via a corresponding computation of the Weyl anomaly on the gravity side. Similar analyses are then carried out for three other examples of modified gravity in five dimensions that include a chemical potential, namely Born-Infeld <b>gravity,</b> <b>charged</b> quasi-topological <b>gravity</b> and a class of Weyl corrected gravity theories with a gauge field, with the last example being treated perturbatively.

50|$|Massless {{particles}} {{are known to}} experience the same gravitational acceleration as other particles (which provides empirical evidence for the equivalence principle) because they do have relativistic mass, which is what acts as the <b>gravity</b> <b>charge.</b> Thus, perpendicular components of forces acting on massless particles simply change their direction of motion, the angle change in radians being GM/rc2 with gravitational lensing, a result predicted by general relativity. The component of force parallel to the motion still affects the particle, but by changing the frequency rather than the speed. This is because the momentum of a massless particle depends only on frequency and direction, while the momentum of low speed massive objects depends on mass, speed, and direction. Massless particles move in straight lines in spacetime, called geodesics, and gravitational lensing relies on spacetime curvature. Gluon-gluon interaction is a little different: gluons exert forces on each other but, because the acceleration {{is parallel to the}} line connecting them (albeit not at simultaneous moments), the acceleration will be zero unless the gluons move in a direction perpendicular to the line connecting them, so that velocity is perpendicular to acceleration.|$|R

40|$|This work investigates an upper-limit {{of charge}} {{for a black}} hole in a {{nonlinear}} Newtonian theory of <b>gravity.</b> The <b>charge</b> is accumulated via protons fired isotropically at the black hole. This theoretical study of gravity (known as `pseudo-Newtonian') is a forced merger of special relativity and Newtonian gravity. Whereas the source of Newton's gravity is purely mass, pseudo-Newtonian gravity includes effects of fields around the mass, giving a more complete picture of how gravity behaves. Interestingly, pseudo-Newtonian gravity predicts such relativistic phenomena as black holes and deviations from Kepler's laws, but of course, provides a less accurate picture than general relativity. Though less accurate, it offers an easier approach to understanding some results of general relativity, and merits interest due to its simplicity. The method of study applied here examines the predictions of pseudo-Newtonian gravity for a particle interacting with a highly charged black hole. A black hole with a suitable charge will reach an upper limit (expressed by pseudo-Newtonian <b>gravity)</b> in <b>charge</b> capacity before Coulomb's law repels like-charge particles away from the hole. In particular, this work attempts to push pseudo-Newtonian gravity to its extreme and discover how its results differ from general relativistic predictions involving the same proton bombardment. It is found that the results for an upper limit of charge in general relativity and this nonlinear theory of Newtonian gravity differ {{by a factor of}} four. This may give insight into the importance of space-time curvature effects on the description of particle dynamics around a black hole. Comment: 13 page...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the coupled system of non-abelian gauge fields with higher-derivative <b>gravity.</b> <b>Charge</b> {{renormalization}} is investigated in this coupled system. It is {{found that the}} leading term in the gauge coupling beta function comes due to interaction of gauge fields with gravitons. This is {{shown to be a}} universal quantity {{in the sense that it}} doesn't depend on the gauge coupling and the gauge group, but may depend on the other couplings of the action (gravitational and matter). The coupled system is studied at one-loop. It is found that the leading term of gauge beta function is zero at one-loop in four dimensions. The effect of gauge fields on the running of gravitational couplings is investigated. The coupled system of gauge field with higher-derivative gravity is shown to satisfy unitarity when quantum corrections are taken in to account. Moreover, it is found that Newton constant goes to zero at short distances. In this renormalizable and unitary theory of gauge field coupled with higher-derivative gravity, the leading term of the gauge beta function, found to be universal for all gauge groups, is further studied in more detail by isolating it in the context of abelian gauge theories coupled with gravity in four dimensions. Using self-duality of abelian gauge theories in four dimensions, this term of the gauge beta function is shown to be zero to all loops. This is found to be independent of the gravity action, regularization scheme and gauge fixing condition. An explicit one-loop computation for arbitrary gravity action further demonstrates the vanishing of this term in the gauge beta function in four dimensions, independent of the regularization scheme and gauge fixing condition. Consequences of this are discussed. Comment: 1 + 42 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
