40|$|The role of land {{surface in}} earth-atmosphere system {{is crucial to}} predict weather and future climate at meso (~ 10 km) and micro (~ 1 km) scales. Systematic {{measurements}} of Land Surface Processes (LSP) within boundary layer are extremely {{important to understand the}} vegetation-atmosphere feedback, to develop new parameterization schemes for Land Surface Models (LSM) and validation of satellite based estimates. Till now, India had no such network of regular micrometeorological observation system for recording, archiving and converting data into scientific usable format. A prototype model of 10 m tall micrometeorological tower known as Agro-Met Station (AMS) has been defined and designed for short canopies (maximum average height 3 m) such as agriculture, grasslands, natural bush etc. This has sensors capable of measuring radiation, energy and soil water balance components continuously with a total of 26 quantities at half-an-hour interval. The data can be archived in and retrieved back from 16 -channel datalogger alongwith station location and time stamping from in-built Global Positioning System (GPS). INSAT-uplinked AMS transmitter operates at a frequency of 402. 75 MHz ± 200 KHz. This dessiminates in situ measured data every hour from any remote station installed in the footprint of INSAT / KALPANA- 1 Satellite.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} functions of a radar antenna is to provide spatial filtering that maximizes the radar's sensitivity in the desired sUIveillance direction while suppressing interference signals that enter the radar from other directions. This article describes a UHFradar antennasystemwith exceptional interference-rejectioncapabilities that are achieved through a combination of precision passive beamforming in the azimuth plane, and active, digital adaptive nulling in elevation. The antenna is composed of 14 stacked rows; each row contains a stripline, low-sidelobe, passive corporate-feed network. For signal reception, a separate receiver and analog-to-digital converter are used at each row output. The system adaptively combines the digitized rowsignals to form an elevationpatternwithnulls at the elevation angles ofinterference sources. The antenna systemis part ofan advanced air surveillance radar that Lincoln Laboratory is developing for the Navy. This article describes the design of the antenna system and presents performance analyses and measured results. Modern radars use a variety of electronic counter-countermeasures to suppress both inadvertent interference and intentional jamming. When the desired target and the interferencesource are notatthesamelocation, a radar {{can take advantage of the}} separation to suppress the interference without suppressing the target return. This selective suppression canbe achieved by a radar antenna with a radiation pattern that provides maximum gain in the direction ofthe targetand a verylowresponse in the interference direction. There are several techniques for controlling the shape of an antenna radiation pattern. Passive, fIxed tapering ofthe aperture illumination can produce a pattern with uniformly low sidelobes outside the direction of the main beam. A pattern of this type is useful for suppressing both interference and clutter. A key parameter in low-sidelobe design is the radiation-pattern sidelobe level expressed in relation to <b>isotropic</b> <b>gain,</b> which is the gain of a lossless antenna that radiates uniformly in all directions. Without undue difficulty, electrically large, high-gain antennas can achieve radiation patterns exhibiting sidelobes that are low with respect to the peak gain, butnot with respect t...|$|E

2500|$|Antenna gain is {{sometimes}} measured as decibels {{relative to a}} half-wave dipole, {{which means that the}} antenna in question is being compared to a dipole, and has a certain amount of gain relative to a dipole antenna tuned to the same operating frequency. In this case, one says the antenna has a gain of [...] "x dBd" [...] (see decibel). More often, gains are expressed relative to an isotropic radiator, which is an imaginary antenna that radiates equally in all directions. In this case one uses dBi instead of dBd (see decibel).

40|$|Multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) {{techniques}} {{may increase}} the capacity of wireless local area networks (WLAN) since they profit from rich scattering of radio waves in indoor environments. On the other hand, much signal processing must be performed {{in a very short}} time to reach practical data rates. This paper reports on elementary steps towards MIMO transmission when the channel is known to the transmitter. In most cases, channel information can be obtained at the transmitter by means of reciprocity. Linear channel inversion (LCI) may then be employed allowing simple processing suitable for real-time applications. In contrast to signal processing at the receiver, LCI offers <b>isotropic</b> noise <b>gain</b> which simplifies coding. On the other hand, power distribution at the transmitter depends on the statistical properties of the MIMO channel. Results in the case of Rayleigh fading indicate that at least one additional antenna is needed at the transmitter for reliable operation.

Performance can now be expressed in terms of transmitter power and a fair comparison with transmission based on signal processing at the receiver is possible...|$|R
40|$|Their unique {{geometrical}} structure first {{suggested by}} Prof. Kenichi Iga in 1977, makes vertical-cavity surface-emitting lasers (VCSELs) compact, versatile, robust and reliable optoelectronic devices, which have already outperformed edge-emitting lasers (EELs) {{in terms of}} low threshold current and high wall-plug efficiency. Most relevantly, regarding application field entering and mass production, is their low cost manufacturing due to their property of enabling wafer-level testing. In addition to these benefits provided by their vertical design, VCSELs exhibit complex polarization behavior resulting from the circular symmetry of their resonator and from the <b>isotropic</b> <b>gain</b> of their active medium, mostly based on quantum well (QW) or quantum dots (QD). In principle, the polarization of the light emitted by these optoelectronic devices should reflect the selection rules of the quantum well (QW) optical transition symmetry and thus should exhibit a circularly polarized state of light. However, various symmetry breaking mechanisms, such as strain, thermal effects, electro-optically induced birefringence, dichroism or an applied magnetic field convert this circular polarization to an elliptically polarized emission, often with {{a large amount of}} linearly polarized light. Therefore, at a first glance, polarization resolved investigations, using a linear polarizer only, on intensity noise, wave chaos, transverse mode behavior and time-resolved measurements are legitimized, although being restricted to a projection on two orthogonal linear polarization components. But clearly these kinds of measurements do not reveal the entire knowledge of the polarization state, due to the conversion of an eventual circular component into a linear component. In contrast to this rather simple, straightforward projection method the full information about the state of polarization is accessible only by determining the four Stokes polarization parameters (SPPs) S 0, S 1, S 2 and S 3. The remarkable fact about these four parameters is that they are directly measurable quantities, thus enabling the complete description of any state of polarization in mathematical terms, including unpolarized light as well as partially polarized light. Noteworthy about the Stokes formalism is the fact, that it has been invented already in 1852 by Sir George Gabriel Stokes. During this time, a crisis in optics appeared due to fundamental different approaches namely the wave- as well as the corpuscular-ansatz. The formulation of the SPPs supports the wave theory essentially, providing explanation of the famous Fresnel-Arago interference laws {{on the basis of the}} wave approach for the first time. These SPPs formulated in 1852, are even nowadays the appropriate formalism to describe the complex polarization behavior of VCSELs. The aim of this work is to conduct comprehensive experimental investigations on spatially, spectrally and time-resolved SPPs of transverse single-mode and transverse multi-mode VCSELs. Furthermore, combined measurements such as spatio-spectrally as well as spectro-temporally resolved measurements will be also performed and compared among each other, demonstrating the consistency and reliability of these quantitative results. Moreover, a detailed analysis of each particular transverse mode will be performed, uncovering the physical mechanisms responsible for the state of polarization of the total emission of transverse single-mode as well as multi-mode VCSELs. In addition the time dependence of polarization states of the total emission on a microsecond timescale will be investigated. These overall results in combination with investigations on time-resolved SPPs measurements for each particular transverse mode will be a point of origin for future numerical simulations...|$|E
5000|$|Antenna gain {{is often}} quoted {{with respect to}} a {{hypothetical}} antenna that radiates equally in all directions, an <b>isotropic</b> radiator. This <b>gain,</b> when measured in decibels, is called dBi. Conservation of energy dictates that high gain antennas must have narrow beams. For example, if a high gain antenna makes a 1 watt transmitter look like a 100 watt transmitter, then the beam can cover at most [...] of the sky (otherwise the total amount of energy radiated in all directions would sum to more than the transmitter power, which is not possible). In turn this implies that high-gain antennas must be physically large, since according to the diffraction limit, the narrower the beam desired, the larger the antenna must be (measured in wavelengths).|$|R
40|$|An optimization-based {{method is}} {{proposed}} {{for the design of}} high-performance separable wavelet filter banks for image coding. This method yields linear-phase perfect-reconstruction systems with high coding gain, good frequency selectivity, and certain prescribed vanishing-moment properties. Several filter banks designed with the proposed method are presented and shown to work extremely well for image coding, outperforming the well-known 9 / 7 filter bank from JPEG 2000 in most cases. With the proposed design method, the coding gain can be maximized with respect to the separable or isotropic image model, or jointly with respect to both models. The joint case, which is shown to be equivalent to the isotropic case, is experimentally demonstrated to lead to filter banks with better average coding performance than the separable case. During the development of the proposed design method, filter banks from a certain popular separable 2 D wavelet class (to which our optimal designs belong) were observed to always have a higher coding gain with respect to the separable image model than with respect to the isotropic one. This behavior is examined in detail, leading to the conclusion that, for filter banks belonging to the above class, it is highly improbable (if not impossible) for the <b>isotropic</b> coding <b>gain</b> to exceed the separable coding gain.

In the first case (Fig. 3) t. he average spacing for X = 16 elements is 3 L/ 4 (N- 1) = 3 L/ 60. For example, if the apert. ure L = 15 X, then the average spacing is 3 X/ 4. The set of elements does not span the complete aperture for this arrangement. For comparison we have also included in this figure curves of gain versus spacing for uniformly spaced arrays of isot. ropic sources and for uniformly spaced arrays of collinear dipoles [3]. We note the remarkable similarity in form between the gain curves for the nonuniform array and the uniform array of collinear dipoles (for which the element factor suppresses grat,ing lobes). Indeed, if the former were increased by a factor of 3 / 2 (the gain of a dipole), it would very nearly coincide Rith the latter. In the second case (Fig. 4) the average spacing for hr + 1 = 17 elements is L/hr = L/ 16. For example, if L = 10, t,hen the average spacing is X. The set of elements does span the entire aperture for this arrangement, but, it must be kept, in mind, the two outermost elements have half the amplitude of the others. In this case maximum gain occurs for an average spacing somewhat greater than one wavelength.

40|$|To {{maintain}} visual {{fixation on}} a distant target during head rotation, the angular vestibulo-ocular reflex (aVOR) should rotate the {{eyes at the}} same speed as the head and in exactly the opposite direction. However, in primates for which the 3 -dimensional (3 D) aVOR has been extensively characterised (humans and squirrel monkeys (Saimiri sciureus)), the aVOR response to roll head rotation about the naso-occipital axis is lower than that elicited by yaw and pitch, causing errors in aVOR magnitude and direction that vary with the axis of head rotation. In other words, primates keep {{the central part of the}} retinal image on the fovea (where photoreceptor density and visual acuity are greatest) but fail to keep that image from twisting about the eyes' resting optic axes. We tested the hypothesis that aVOR direction dependence is an adaptation related to primates' frontal-eyed, foveate status through comparison with the aVOR of a lateral-eyed, afoveate mammal (Chinchilla lanigera). As chinchillas' eyes are afoveate and never align with each other, we predicted that the chinchilla aVOR would be relatively low in <b>gain</b> and <b>isotropic</b> (equal in <b>gain</b> for every head rotation axis). In 11 normal chinchillas, we recorded binocular 3 D eye movements in darkness during static tilts, 20 – 100 deg s− 1 whole-body sinusoidal rotations (0. 5 – 15 Hz), and 3000 deg s− 2 acceleration steps. Although the chinchilla 3 D aVOR gain changed with both frequency and peak velocity over the range we examined, we consistently found that it was more nearly isotropic than the primate aVOR. Our results suggest that primates' anisotropic aVOR represents an adaptation to their forward-eyed, foveate status. In primates, yaw and pitch aVOR must be compensatory to stabilise images on both foveae, whereas roll aVOR can be under-compensatory because the brain tolerates torsion of binocular images that remain on the foveae. In contrast, the lateral-eyed chinchilla faces different adaptive demands and thus enlists a different aVOR strategy...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ing. (Nuclear Engineering)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2010 The {{development}} of high temperature heat exchangers {{will play a}} vital part {{in the success of}} High Temperature Nuclear Reactors (HTRs). Manufacturing such heat exchangers from metals is becoming increasingly difficult as the operating temperatures keep rising. Above 1000 'C most metals loose their strength and have high creep rates, while certain ceramic materials (including graphite, in the absence of oxygen) are able to operate at these temperatures. A literature study was done in order to identify the major problems regarding the use of graphite for heat exchanger construction as well as to investigate to what extent graphite has been used for heat exchanger construction in the past. Following from the literature survey, it was decided to design and manufacture a Printed Circuit Heat Exchanger (PCHE) from <b>isotropic</b> graphite to <b>gain</b> experience regarding the use of graphite as a heat exchanger material. This heat exchanger was then tested in order to learn about the operation of a graphite heat exchanger and to determine its effectiveness. A model ofthe heat exchanger was also constructed in order to determine what the performance of such a heat exchanger should theoretically be. It was found that the single greatest hurdle standing in the way ofgraphite being used as a heat exchanger material is its high gas permeability. This causes mixing between the two fluid streams as well as leakages to the environment, which {{have a negative effect on}} the heat exchanger's heat transfer capability. The methods used to establish a seal between the consecutive plates of the PCHE are also affected by the permeability of the graphite. Coatings on the surface of the graphite might be able to reduce its permeability and can also inhibit the high temperature degradation of graphite in the presence of oxygen. Manufacturing very small flow channels for the PCHE is limited by the availability of small enough end mills. Alternative manufucturing techniques is needed to economically construct a graphite PCHE. It was also found that the heat transfer effectiveness of the heat exchanger is influenced negatively by heat losses to the environment through the outer surface ofthe heat exchanger. Effective insulation around the heat exchanger or a graphite material :vith higher heat conductivity perpendicular to the flow direction might solve this problem. This study concluded that if diffusion bonding techniques, effective coatings and a graphite material with increased heat conductivity perpendicular to the flow direction are used, manufacturing a printed circuit heat exchanger from graphite is feasible.
