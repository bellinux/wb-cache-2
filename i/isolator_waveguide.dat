40|$|A method {{based on}} Yeh's {{rigorous}} 4 × 4 matrix algebra and a fast perturbation-theory-based method are proposed for modeling and optimization {{of an integrated}} magneto-optical (MO) waveguide isolator. The transverse MO Kerr effect in ferromagnetic Co 90 Fe 10 is used to design the integrated <b>isolator.</b> <b>Waveguide</b> losses introduced by absorption in the MO metallic film are compensated for by optical gain in an InP-based semiconductor optical amplifier with a tensile strained multiple-quantum-well (MQW) active region. The desired device isolation, which originates from the nonreciprocity of the transverse MO effect, is obtained by operation of the device under appropriate current injection, leading to zero modal net gain in the forward direction while the device remains lossy in the backward direction. In {{the approach based on}} Yeh's matrix formalism, phenomena such as the MO effects described by anisotropic permittivity tensors, waveguide losses in absorbing layers, and optical gain in the active layer are explicitly included. Numerical aspects of the resonant condition solution for waveguide modes are discussed. In the perturbation theory method, the MO nonreciprocal waveguide effects are calculated in a first-order scheme. The general models are applied in an example of a realistic InP-based MQW isolator with a Co 90 Fe 10 MO layer, indicating that practical isolation ratios are achievable within reasonable levels of necessary material gain. Rigorous and perturbation models are compared, and good agreement is obtained. This result indicates that first-order perturbation theory modeling of integrated magneto-optics is accurate enough, even for devices that employ MO materials with relatively strong Voigt parameters...|$|E

40|$|The {{optimization}} {{design of}} the layer structure for a novel type of a 1. 3 m monolithically integrated InP-based optical <b>waveguide</b> <b>isolator</b> is presented. The concept of this component is based on introducing a nonreciprocal loss–gain behavior in a standard semiconductor optical amplifier (SOA) structure by contacting the SOA with a transversely magnetized ferromagnetic metal contact, sufficiently close to the guiding and amplifying core of the SOA. The thus induced nonreciprocal complex transverse Kerr shift on the effective index of the guided TM modes, combined with a proper current injection, allows for forward transparency and backward optical ex-tinction. We introduce two different optimization criteria for finding the optimal SOA layer structure, using two different figure-of-merit functions (FoM) for the device performance. The device performance is also com-pared for three different compositions of the CoxFe 1 −x x= 0, 50, 90 ferromagnetic transition metal alloy sys-tem.

40|$|Simulations {{demonstrate}} that undoped yttrium iron garnet (YIG) seedlayers cause reduced Faraday rotation in silicon-on-insulator (SOI) waveguides with Ce-doped YIG claddings. Undoped seedlayers {{are required for}} the crystallization of the magneto-optical Ce:YIG claddings, but they diminish {{the interaction of the}} Ce:YIG with the guided modes. Therefore new magneto-optical garnets, terbium iron garnet (TIG) and bismuth-doped TIG (Bi:TIG), are introduced that can be integrated directly on Si and quartz substrates without seedlayers. The Faraday rotations of TIG and Bi:TIG films at 1550 nm were measured to be + 500 and - 500 °/cm, respectively.

40|$|In this work, a {{dielectric}} waveguide mode solver is presented considering a general nonreciprocal permittivity tensor. The proposed method {{allows us to}} investigate important cases of practical interest {{in the field of}} integrated optics, such as magneto-optical <b>isolators</b> and anisotropic <b>waveguides.</b> Unlike the earlier developed mode solver, our approach allows for the precise computation of both forward and backward propagating modes in the nonreciprocal case, ensuring high accuracy and computational efficiency. As a result, the nonreciprocal loss/phase shift can be directly computed, avoiding the use of the perturbation method. To compute the electromagnetic modes, the Rayleigh-Ritz functional is derived for the non-self adjoint case, it is discretized using the node-based finite element method and the penalty function is added to remove the spurious solutions. The resulting quadratic eigenvalue problem is linearized and solved in terms of the propagation constant for a given frequency (i. e., γ–formulation). The main benefits of this formulation are that it avoids the time-consuming iterations and preserves the matrix sparsity. Finally, the method is used to study two examples of integrated optical isolators based on nonreciprocal phase shift and nonreciprocal loss effect, respectively. The developed method is then compared with the perturbation approach and its simplified formulation based on semivectorial approximation...|$|R
40|$|We report two novel {{strategies}} to integrate magneto-optical oxides on oxidized silicon and SOI platforms based on strip-loaded waveguide structures. By using conventional waveguide fabrication and thin film deposition techniques, strip-loaded waveguides for magneto-optical non-reciprocal phase shift (NRPS) applications {{can be integrated}} on a silicon platform. As a demonstration, two structures, i. e. As[sub 2]S[sub 3]/Y[sub 3]Fe[sub 5]O[sub 12] (YIG) and YIG/SOI waveguides are fabricated. Using pulsed-laser deposition followed by rapid thermal annealing, yttrium iron oxide films {{in which more than}} 95 vol. % had crystallized into the YIG phase were achieved on both substrates. The optical loss of the As[sub 2]S[sub 3]/Y[sub 3]Fe[sub 5]O[sub 12] waveguide was characterized by a cut-back method to be ~ 10 dB/cm at 1550 nm, while the optical loss of a 450 nm wide YIG/SOI waveguide was determined to be 41 dB/cm at 1550 nm by measuring the quality factor Q of a pulley-type ring resonator consisting of such waveguides. The propagation loss of polycrystalline YIG on a SiO[subscript 2]/Si substrate was around 50 dB/cm at 1550 nm wavelength. The NRPS and figure of merit of both waveguides were simulated. It is suggested that a Bi:YIG or Ce:YIG layer may be integrated in these waveguide structures to achieve a higher NRPS and figure of merit for optical <b>isolator</b> applications.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the last}} few decades, {{researchers}} have {{given a lot of}} attention to new engineered materials with the purpose of developing new technologies and devices such as mechanical filters, low frequency sound and vibration <b>isolators,</b> and acoustic <b>waveguides.</b> For instance, elastic phononic crystals may come to mind. They are materials with elastic or fluid inclusions inside a matrix made of an elastic solid. The anomalous behavior in phononic crystals arises from interference of waves propagating within an inhomogeneous material. The inclusions inside the matrix cause strong modifications of scattering properties. However, the application of phononic crystals is still limited to sonic frequencies. In fact, band gaps can be generated only when the acoustic wavelength is comparable to the distance between the inclusion. In order to overcome this limitation, a new class of metamaterial has been proposed: meta composite. This new class of material can modify the dynamics of the underlying structure using a bidimensional array of electromechanical transducers, which are composed by piezo patches connected to a synthetic negative capacitance. In this study, an application of the Floquet-Bloch theorem for vibroacoustic power flow optimization will be presented. In the context of periodically distributed, damped 2 D mechanical systems, this numerical approach allows one to compute the multimodal waves dispersion curves into the entire first Brillouin zone. This approach also permits optimization of the piezoelectric shunting electrical impedance, which controls energy diffusion into the proposed semiactive distributed set of cells. Experiments performed on the examined structure illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed control method. The experiment requires a rectangular metallic plate equipped with seventyfive piezopatches, controlled independently by electronic circuits. More specifically, the out-of-plane displacements and the averaged kinetic energy of the controlled plate are compared in two different cases (control system on/off). The resulting data clearly show how this proposed technique is able to dampen and selectively reflect the incident waves...|$|R
40|$|This {{project is}} aimed at the {{integration}} of a polarisation-insensitive optical <b>waveguide</b> <b>isolator</b> on a Silicon-on-Insulator platform. The final device must provide comparable performance for both Transverse Electric and Transverse Magnetic modes at a wavelength of 1550 nm. This is achieved through two core components, a 45 ° Nonreciprocal Polarisation Mode Converter, and a 45 ° Reciprocal Polarisation Mode Converter. In order to realise the Nonreciprocal Polarisation Mode Converter, several materials were investigated, all consisting of Silicon-on-insulator substrates with various thicknesses of the core layer that were coated with films of Magneto-Optic garnet materials. A wide number of Magneto-Optic garnet materials were tested. Among them, the Cerium-Terbium Iron Garnet proved the most promising for two reasons: first, it has a considerable Faraday rotation coefficient; secondly, it can be grown in crystalline form {{without the need for}} a buffer/seed layer, necessary for growing most other garnets. Simulations were carried out for all grown materials in order to identify the most promising design. The simulated designs, however, could not always be translated into fabricated devices, as sometimes growth challenges would hinder the quality of the material. Since the growths on the 340 nm and 500 nm Silicon-on-Insulator platforms provided the best material quality, devices on these material systems were fabricated and optically characterised. Nonreciprocal isolation performance was observed in all fabricated devices, independently of the Magneto-Optic garnet used. On the 340 nm Silicon-on-Insulator platform, the best performance was obtained when Bismuth-Terbium Iron Garnet, either on its own or in combination with Terbium Iron Garnet, was used as Magneto-Optic periodic cladding, leading to more than 3 / 4 π Stokes vector angle. On the 500 nm Silicon-on-Insulator platform instead, Cerium-Yttrium Iron Garnet, either by Magnesium Oxide or on Yttrium Iron Garnet, provided a calculated isolation ratio of 11. 6 dB. The length of the fabricated devices ranged between 3 mm and 6 mm. A reproducible device fabrication process, optical characterisation method and dedicated data analysis process had to be developed for this project. Nonreciprocal Polarisation Mode Conversion was demonstrated for devices on both the 500 nm and 340 nm Silicon-on-Insulator platforms. Moreover, in order to achieve integration of Magneto-Optic garnet materials on Silicon-on-Insulator substrates, Radio-Frequency sputtering was preferred to wafer bonding as it improves the controllability and lends itself better to scaling up production. With regard to the Reciprocal Polarisation Mode Converter, an asymmetric structure consisting of an L-shaped waveguide was chosen. In such a structure, the rotation of the optical axis enables an injected linear polarisation mode to excite hybrid modes and reciprocal mode conversion. The research carried out in this project for the reciprocal polarisation mode converter helped identify major issues with fabrication and characterisation, and lead to the proposal of a new design for further research. This work successfully realised the first integrated polarisation-independent Faraday rotator showing comparable performance for both Transverse Electric and Transverse Magnetic modes. Device operation was based on nonreciprocal polarisation mode conversion, and it was demonstrated on both 500 nm and 340 nm Silicon-on-Insulator platforms. The results shown in this work in terms of performance and footprint prove the technology is suitable for optical integration...|$|R
