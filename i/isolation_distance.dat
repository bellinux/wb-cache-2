5000|$|<b>Isolation</b> by <b>distance</b> (IBD) (note: {{the acronym}} IBD {{is also used}} for another {{important}} concept in population genetics, Identity by descent) is a term {{used to refer to}} the accrual of local genetic variation under geographically limited dispersal [...] The IBD model is useful for determining the distribution of gene frequencies over a geographic region. Both dispersal variance and migration probabilities are variables in this model and both contribute to local genetic differentiation. <b>Isolation</b> by <b>distance</b> is usually the simplest model for the cause of genetic isolation between populations. Evolutionary biologists and population geneticists have been exploring varying theories and models for explaining population structure. Yoichi Ishida compares two important theories of <b>isolation</b> by <b>distance</b> and clarifies the relationship between the two. According to Ishida, Sewall Wright’s <b>isolation</b> by <b>distance</b> theory is termed ecological <b>isolation</b> by <b>distance</b> while Gustave Malécot’s theory is called genetic isolation by distance.Isolation by distance is distantly related to speciation. Multiple types of isolating barriers, namely prezygotic isolating barriers which includes <b>isolation</b> by <b>distance,</b> are considered to be the key factor in keeping populations apart limiting gene flow.|$|R

In the vicinity of the nature reserve Bt-maize species MON  810 as well as conventional maize was grown.

The Unrestricted operating grants are broken down into three components: the Weighted Enrolment Grant (WEG); the Research Grant and the Extra Formula Grants. The WEG accounts for approximately 91% of the total operating funding provided to universities. Extra Formula Grants take into consideration unique characteristics such as size; French-language instruction; part-time students; <b>isolation</b> (<b>distance</b> from Halifax).

5000|$|The term [...] "summit" [...] is {{generally}} {{used only for}} a mountain peak with some significant amount of topographic prominence (height above the lowest point {{en route to the}} nearest higher peak) or topographic <b>isolation</b> (<b>distance</b> from the nearest point of higher elevation); for example, a boulder next to the main summit of a mountain is not considered a summit. Summits near a higher peak, with some prominence or isolation, but not reaching a certain cutoff value for the quantities, are often considered subsummits (or subpeaks) of the higher peak, and are considered as part of the same mountain. The UIAA definition is that a summit is independent if it has a prominence of 30 m or more; it is a mountain if it has a prominence of at least 300 m. This can be summarised as follows:A pyramidal peak is an exaggerated form produced by ice erosion of a mountain top.Summit may also refer to the highest point along a line, trail, or route.|$|E

30|$|For precautionary reasons, Felke and Langenbruch (2005) {{recommended}} an <b>isolation</b> <b>distance</b> of 1, 000  m for Bt-maize cultivation in {{consideration of}} nature reserves where Lepidopterans are found that were not assessed by respective toxicity tests. This {{is the case for}} the Ruhlsdorfer Bruch. Considering a buffer zone of 1, 000  m the maize pollen deposition will not exceed 100, 000 maize pollen/m² (10 /cm²) with a probability of 90  % according to the results of the statistical analysis (see Fig. 4 and Table 4). There is no certainty that this exposure would not cause any definite adverse effects. However, this <b>isolation</b> <b>distance</b> reflects a feasible regulation measure that could be monitored under field conditions by technical means and be adjusted in case of new scientific findings. As described by Schmidt and Schröder (2009) an <b>isolation</b> <b>distance</b> of 1, 000  m would still allow GMO cultivation at 88  % of the total cropland in Germany. Considering land use management tools and the distribution of target organisms the restrictions for GMO cultivation would be negligible. Accordingly, the recommended buffer zones reflect a compromise between legal necessities and economically feasible regulations considering the promotion of GMO cultivation and nature conservation.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{purposes}} of this study were to determine the percentage of out-crossing, <b>isolation</b> <b>distance</b> and pollinator insect species for cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) seed production in the Aydin region in Turkey. The glandless and red-leaf traits in G. hirsutum were used as genetic markers. Two experiments were conducted over two years that monitored out-crossing in adjacent rows and adjacent plants and established that the percentage of out-crossing varied. The percentage of out-crossing varied between 0 % and 13. 3 % depending on the genetic marker. In the experiment to determine <b>isolation</b> <b>distance,</b> natural crossing percentage was not observed in 2002, while this percentage was 0. 8 % in the first rows in 2003.

40|$|The {{adoption}} {{of genetically modified}} (GM) crops in the European Union (EU) raises questions on the feasibility of coexistence between GM and non-GM crops. Regulations to ensure that different cropping systems can develop side-by-side without excluding any agricultural option are currently implemented or developed by member states. The aim of this review is to explore whether nationally or regionally proposed coexistence strategies comply with the general principles established by the European Commission that ask for science-based and proportionate coexistence measures. In the first part, existing legal requirements and potential sources of adventitious mixing are reviewed. It is discussed what type of coexistence measures might be necessary to keep GM inputs below the legal tolerance threshold of 0. 9 %. Concentrating on cross-fertilisation as the major biological source of adventitious mixing in maize, it is then assessed to which extent available scientific data on cross-fertilisation can explain the diversity of currently proposed <b>isolation</b> <b>distances</b> by several member states. In the second part, it is analysed whether currently proposed <b>isolation</b> <b>distances</b> reflect contending policy objectives towards GM crops that largely exceed the economic scope of coexistence. It is investigated how coexistence is intersecting with a wider debate {{about the role of}} GM crops in agriculture. Based on the analysis of existing cross-fertilisation data, it is concluded that some of the currently proposed <b>isolation</b> <b>distances</b> are not in line with the coexistence principles laid down by the European Commission: they are (i) excessive from a scientific point of view; (ii) difficult to implement in practice; (iii) rarely proportional to the regional heterogeneity in the agricultural landscape; and (iv) not proportional to the farmers' basic economic incentives for coexistence. Hence, the range of proposed <b>isolation</b> <b>distances</b> cannot simply be explained by different interpretations of available scientific data, possible error intervals and remaining uncertainties inherent in the scientific process. It is argued that other than scientific issues must be at play. One might thus claim that coexistence has become an arena of contending values and visions on the future of agriculture and on the role GM crops might play therein. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{future of}} {{tropical}} forest species depends {{in part on}} their ability to survive in human-modified landscapes. Forest strips present a priority area for biodiversity research because they are a common feature of many managed landscapes, are often afforded a high level of legal protection, and can provide a cost-effective and politically acceptable conservation strategy. Despite the potential conservation benefits that could be provided by forest strips, ecologists currently lack sufficient evidence to inform policy and guide their design and management. We used a quasi-experimental landscape in the Brazilian Amazon to test the importance of four management-relevant variables (forest type, <b>isolation</b> <b>distance,</b> forest structure, and large mammal activity) on the potential biodiversity conservation value of narrow forest strips for dung beetles. Information-theoretic model selection based on AICc revealed strong support for the influence of large mammal activity and forest type on dung beetle abundance; <b>isolation</b> <b>distance</b> on species richness; and forest structure on the relative abundance of matrix-tolerant species. Multi-dimensional scaling showed a strong influence of forest type and isolation on community composition and structure, with riparian and dry-land strips having complementary sets of species. 5.

To enhance the conservation value and ecological integrity of forest strips in human-modified landscapes we recommend that strip design considers both <b>isolation</b> <b>distance</b> and whether or not the strips encompass perennial streams.
