40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to examine the effect of non-audit services on audit fees, to investigate the relationship between non-audit fees and the issuance of qualified audit opinion, and to analyse the proportion of non-audit fees to total fees paid by a client to its auditor. The regression analysis reveals a significant positive relationship between audit fees and non-audit fees, which is contrary to the theory available in the literature. Further tests are done and alternative explanations are provided. The results obtained from the t-test suggest a significant relationship between non-audit <b>fees</b> and <b>qualified</b> audit opinions. The outcomes indicate that on average audit opinions are dependent on the amount of non-audit fees.

40|$|A {{television}} producer or distributor (the "barter " syndicator) licenses television programming {{to a local}} television station {{in return for a}} fee and a specified amount of local advertising time. If the sale were for only a <b>fee,</b> it would <b>qualify</b> for revenue recognition when all the criteria of paragraph 6 of Statement 53 are satisfied. In the part-fee, part-advertising-time scenario, the syndicator contracts to sell the advertising time on local stations to a third-party national advertiser. The issue is when the syndicator should recognize revenue for the advertising time. EITF DISCUSSION The Task Force reached a consensus that the "barter " revenue would be recognized when the criteria of Statement 53 are met and noncancelable contracts are signed with both the station and the advertiser. [Note: See STATUS section. ] If a noncancelable contract does not exist, revenue would be recognized when the criteria of Statement 53 are met and the advertising is aired. Task Force members acknowledged that alternative methods exist but rejected them due to their complexity and the desirability of having only one method in practice.

ASATIN, is one of ticketing organization in Lombok, Mataram, in which the members were verdicted by the assembly of the business competition supervisory commission, because they made an agreement about the amount of fee given the sub agent who sold the airlines tickets from the Agents, namely the ASATIN Members.

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the Government Accountability Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is responsible for approving medical devices [...] such as catheters and artificial hearts [...] to provide reasonable assurance of their safety and effectiveness. As part of this responsibility, FDA, an agency within the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), reviews applications submitted by medical device companies for devices they wish to market in the United States, including devices that are new or those that constitute modifications to already approved devices. Prior to 2002, members of Congress, representatives of the medical device industry, and others expressed concern that FDA lacked the resources necessary to complete such reviews {{in a timely manner}} to ensure that patients have access to useful, possibly life-saving, devices. In response, Congress enacted the Medical Device User Fee and Modernization Act of 2002 (MDUFMA), which authorizes FDA to charge user fees for some device applications and not others. Revenues from the user fees, together with additional appropriations that were also authorized by MDUFMA, were intended to provide additional resources to FDA for improving the timeliness of device review. To help ensure that user fees are not financially prohibitive for small medical device companies, MDUFMA provides that companies qualifying as small businesses in a given fiscal year can receive fee discounts and, in certain cases, <b>fee</b> waivers. To <b>qualify</b> as a small business under MDUFMA, a company must submit information to FDA demonstrating that its annual revenues [...] including the revenues of any affiliate, partner, or parent firm [...] are at or below a certain threshold. MDUFMA originally set the threshold for small business qualification at $ 30 million, and in 2005, the threshold was increased to $ 100 million by the Medical Device User Fee Stabilization Act of 2005 (MDUFSA). All companies qualifying as small businesses under the $ 100 million threshold pay reduced fees when submitting applications subject to user fees. Originally, MDUFMA also provided that companies qualifying as small businesses receive a fee waiver the first time ever they submit one of certain applications that generally have higher fees. While MDUFSA raised the small business threshold to $ 100 million, it provided that only companies with annual revenues of $ 30 million or less could continue to receive fee waivers. FDA's authority to collect user fees will sunset October 1, 2007. Congress asked us to provide annual revenue information for companies participating in the MDUFMA user fee program to assist Congress as it determines whether changes to the threshold for small business qualification are needed. Revenue information is available for companies that qualify as small businesses, which submit annual revenue information to FDA, and publicly traded companies, which register securities with, and submit annual revenue information to, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). In this report, we provide revenue information for (1) companies that qualified as small businesses under the MDUFMA user fee program in fiscal year 2006 and (2) companies publicly traded in the United States that submitted device applications subject to user fees and did not qualify as small businesses under MDUFMA in fiscal year 2006. ...|$|R
5000|$|Louisiana {{is one of}} {{the easiest}} states to get on the ballot. Anyone may obtain a spot on the ballot by either paying a <b>qualifying</b> <b>fee,</b> or {{submitting}} petition signatures. For independent candidates for President (or non-recognized parties) the fee is $500 or 5000 signatures, with at least 500 from each Congressional district. Recognized Parties simply file their slate of Electors - their access is automatic, no fee or signatures required. For statewide office, the signature requirement is the same as that for President, but the fees are $750 for Governor and $600 for all other statewide offices. District and local office fees range from $40 or 50 signatures for a small town office, to $600 or 1000 signatures for US House. All signatures for district offices must come from within that district. If the office is for a political party committee, the signatures must be from people affiliated with that party. For Presidential Preference Primaries, the fee is $750 or 1000 signatures affiliated with that party from each Congressional district.(pdf) Present Louisiana law only allows for Presidential Primaries if a party has more than 40,000 registered voters statewide. Currently, this only applies to the Democratic and Republican Parties. Louisiana law changed in 2004 under efforts from the Libertarian Party of Louisiana to relax rules in place at that time for recognizing political parties in the state. There are now two methods to gain official recognition. Method A allows a party to be recognized if it pays a $1000 fee AND has 1000 or more voters registered under its label. To retain recognition, it must field a candidate at least once in any four-year period in a statewide election - with no requirement on performance in the election. Statewide election slots include Presidential Elector, Governor, Senator, Lt. Governor, Secretary of State, Attorney General, Treasurer, Comm. of Insurance, and Commissioner of Agriculture. To date, the Libertarian Party and the Green Party have used this method to attain and retain official party recognition. Method B allows a party to be recognized if one of its candidates in a statewide race or for Presidential Elector achieves 5% of the vote. To retain recognition, it must repeat the 5% tally for statewide office or Presidential Elector at least once in any four-year period. To date, the Reform Party has used this method to gain and retain official party recognition. Due to their size, parties recognized by these methods are exempt from certain laws governing public elections of political committee offices and from certain financial reporting requirements until their membership reaches 5% of registered voters statewide. Recognized political parties in Louisiana are allowed to have their party name appear alongside their candidates on the ballot, and for their party to be offered as a specific choice on voter registration cards. Non-recognized parties appear as OTHER, and the party name must be written in on the registration card. Non-affiliated voters are listed as N for No Party. In the 2008 and 2010 Congressional elections, Louisiana experimented with closed primaries for House and Senate. Under this system, recognized parties participated in semi-closed primaries before the general election. Only one candidate from each party was allowed on the General Election ballot; there was no limit for OTHER or NONE. An attempt to pass a law differentiating [...] "minor" [...] parties similar to the rule for Presidential Primaries was defeated but made irrelevant by Louisiana reverting to its [...] "Jungle Primary" [...] system where all candidates, regardless of number from any party, all compete together on the same ballot. If no one achieves a majority, a general election is held as a run-off between the top two, also regardless of party affiliation.|$|R
