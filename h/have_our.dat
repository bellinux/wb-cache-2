25|$|We must refuse {{everything}} to the Jews as a nation and accord {{everything to}} Jews as individuals.

They must be citizens individually. But, some will say to me, they do not want to be citizens. Well then! If they do not want to be citizens, they should say so, and then, we should banish them.
