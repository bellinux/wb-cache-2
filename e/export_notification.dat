40|$|The Rotterdam Convention {{that was}} signed in Rotterdam on 10 September 1998 and entered into force on 24 February 2004 regroups {{currently}} 154 Parties. It introduced the Prior Informed Consent (PIC) procedure for certain hazardous chemicals and pesticides in International trade. The convention aims to promote shared responsibility and cooperative effort among Parties {{in order to protect}} {{human health and the environment}} from potential harm and to contribute to their environmentally sound use, by facilitating information exchange about their characteristics, by providing for a national decision-making process on their import and export and by disseminating these decisions to Parties. The European Union adopted the Rotterdam Convention by Council Decision 2006 / 730 /EC of 25 September 2006. Furthermore, Regulation (EC) No 689 / 2008 of the European Parliament and the Council of 17 June 2008 concerning the export and import of dangerous chemicals is the latest in a series of measures over the years that seek to address international trade with dangerous chemicals. This Regulation reaffirms the EU commitment towards ensuring proper control in the trade and use of dangerous chemicals at the global level, based on the principle that it should help to protect human health and the environment beyond its borders as well as within. Two linked processes were identified as characterising the PIC content management activities. They are analysed separately: the <b>export</b> <b>notifications</b> process and the explicit consents process. The <b>export</b> <b>notifications</b> process aims to identify uniquely the single administrative document clearing customs. The explicit consents process aims to explicitly exchange risk management information, between an exporting designated national authority and an importing one, prior to export of chemicals. Each process is first described. The functionalities supporting the process are listed and explained. The specific implication of the administrator in the process is then identified. Finally the liaison between both processes is analysed. Several working documents are annexed in order to transparently manage the hand over of the PIC content management activities to the European Chemicals Agency - ECHA. JRC.
