In the first story, an adolescent boy inserts a Vaseline-lubricated carrot into his rectum to stimulate his prostate, then, in haste, stashes it {{in a pile}} of laundry when he is called to dinner. Later, his mother takes the laundry away and presumably discovers the used carrot, but never mentions the incident. Next, the narrator tells the tale of a young boy who, having heard that it enhances masturbatory pleasure, inserts a thin stick of candle wax into his urethra. The wax unexpectedly slips back into the boy's bladder, thereby blocking his urine flow and causing blood to seep from his penis. Because he requires expensive surgery, his parents are forced to pay to repair his bladder with the boy's college savings. Finally, the narrator explains how he himself suffered a sexual injury, when sitting on the water-intake valve at the bottom of his home swimming pool while masturbating. While swimming {{down to the bottom of}} the pool to stimulate his prostate before coming up for air—a repetitive process he refers to as [...] "Pearl diving"—the suction from the valve causes his rectum and lower intestines to prolapse and become tangled in the filter. Ultimately, he finds himself stuck on the bottom of the pool and must gnaw through his own innards to free himself and avoid drowning. When Saint Gut-Free's sister later becomes pregnant, he falsely believes that he is the father of an <b>incestuous</b> <b>child,</b> since he thinks his sister has encountered the semen he leaves in their family swimming pool on that fateful day (she is actually pregnant by her boyfriend and decided to have an abortion).|$|E

500|$|As {{is typical}} of Shearsmith and Pemberton's work, [...] "Sardines" [...] {{addresses}} dark topics. Writing in The Daily Telegraph, Paul Kendall identified some of Shearsmith and Pemberton's [...] "regular tropes" [...] utilised in the episode; namely [...] "a bunch of misfits, uncomfortable silences and allusions to dark crimes in the distant past". Billen felt that the treatment of dark issues was reminiscent {{of the work of}} Alan Ayckbourn. Particular themes addressed in the episode include murder, <b>incestuous</b> relationships, <b>child</b> sexual abuse, vengeance and adultery. As the episode progresses, secrets related to these themes are revealed to be the explanation for apparently innocuous tendencies, such as Carl's dislike for the sardine song and John's aversion to soap.|$|R

Written by Steve Pemberton and Reece Shearsmith, it premiered on BBC Two and BBC Two HD on 5 February 2014. The episode features a stand-alone plot revolving around a group of adults, who are non-recurring characters, playing sardines at an engagement party. Rebecca, the bride-to-be, finds a boring man named Ian in a wardrobe; he introduces himself as a colleague of Jeremy, Rebecca's fiancé. The pair are subsequently joined by family, friends and colleagues of Rebecca and Jeremy. As more people enter the room and step into the wardrobe, secrets shared {{by some of the}} characters are revealed, with various allusions to <b>incestuous</b> relationships, <b>child</b> sexual abuse and adultery. The humour is both dark and British, with references to past unhappiness and polite but awkward interactions.|$|R

40|$|Research on <b>incestuous</b> <b>child</b> abuse (ICA) {{has focused}} {{primarily}} on father-daughter incest (FDI), {{and to a lesser}} extent, on stepfather-daughter incest (SFDI). The sparse research on brother-sister incest (BSI) indicates that it is not only at least as prevalent as FDI and SFDI, but that the seriousness of the abuse and the long-term impacts are greater. At the same time, research {{over the past few decades}} has increasingly noted the relationship between childhood sexual abuse as a risk factor for girls ‟ and women‟s offending. The current study uses two self-report survey samples, one of incarcerated women and the other of incarcerated girls, to compare the respondents ‟ FDI, SFDI, and BSI rates and whether these rates are related to outcome variables such as alcohol/drug use and problems, self-esteem, self-harming behaviors, and for the sample of girls, likelihood of a pregnancy. The findings in this study indicate not only exceptionally high sexual victimizations by fathers, stepfathers, and brothers, but that among the incarcerated women, brothers sexually abuse more often and at more serious levels than fathers and stepfathers.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 73 - 78) This {{study was}} designed to identify and then evaluate clinics in Los Angeles claiming to offer comprehensive treatment programs for incest cases. An extensive review of the literature discussing psychodynamics and treatment of incest cases indicated that incest is symptomatic of a family's dysfunctional dynamics and that comprehensive treatment requires therapy for the entire family, including siblings. Therapy should include work with each family member in individual, conjoint, family and/or group therapy. Further required are special training for staff, caseload research, coordination of services with other social agencies, public information programs and formation of self-help support groups. Methods used in conducting this study were informal interviews and a survey form listing treatment components sought. Only six centers were identified and subsequently surveyed for the specified services. Results indicated that no single facility provides all treatment components. The emphasis overall. is on treating the ???incested??? child and her mother and father at least individually. Few programs emphasize conjoint therapy for parents or family therapy. None place much emphasis on inclusion of siblings. Group therapy, while valued, occurs only as caseload's sizes permit. Funding problems, smallness of staff, and newness of program combine to block aspirations for home visits, in-depth research, special training for staff, and development of public education programs. Self-help groups, recognized as important, won't be formed until caseloads produce ???graduates???. It is concluded that the movement to treat <b>incestuous</b> <b>child</b> abuse in Los Angeles is disorganized though well intentioned. Each of the six identifiable programs offers valuable if not quite comprehensive services. More emphasis needs to be put on inclusion of siblings in therapy, family therapy, group counseling, development of self-help support groups, in-depth research, and public education...|$|E

[...] An important turning-point was the Black Death of 1348-1350, which killed a large percentage of the European population, and which many Christians believed had been caused by their enemies. The catalog of typical charges that would later be leveled at witches, of spreading diseases, committing orgies (sometimes <b>incestuous),</b> cannibalizing <b>children,</b> and following Satanism, emerged during the 14th century as crimes attributed to heretics and Jews.|$|R

25|$|Incest {{between a}} child or {{adolescent}} and a related adult is known as <b>child</b> <b>incestuous</b> abuse, and {{has been identified as}} the most widespread form of child sexual abuse with a huge capacity to damage the young person. One researcher stated that more than 70% of abusers are immediate family members or someone very close to the family. Another researcher stated that about 30% of all perpetrators of sexual abuse are related to their victim, 60% of the perpetrators are family acquaintances, like a neighbor, babysitter or friend and 10% of the perpetrators in child sexual abuse cases are strangers. A child sexual abuse offense where the perpetrator is related to the child, either by blood or marriage, is a form of incest described as intrafamilial child sexual abuse.|$|R
50|$|The plot {{focuses on}} the {{children}}'s ordeal as shut-ins and their clashes with the ultra-religious grandmother, who loathes the children due to their <b>incestuous</b> conception. The <b>children</b> struggle to survive, even as their mother's visits quickly taper off. In particular, Olivia becomes obsessed with Chris and Cathy, out of the warped belief that they have become lovers and are repeating the same incestuous acts like Corrine and her uncle did. Discovering them sleeping {{in the same bed}} one morning, the grandmother smashes Cathy's ballerina music box, given to her by her deceased father. After Olivia later discovers the two innocently talking while Cathy is bathing, she calls them sinners. Chris manages to chase her out, but Olivia later ambushes Cathy in the bedroom, locks Chris in the closet preceding the attic, and hacks off Cathy's hair with a pair of scissors. She then starves them for a week, and Chris is forced to feed Cory his own blood so he doesn't die of starvation.|$|R

To that end, the children are shut inside one bedroom of the mansion, only {{with access to the}} mansion's attic via a secret stairway. It is on their first day there that their grandmother reveals the shocking truth of what caused Corrine to be disowned and stricken from her father's will years ago: Corrine's husband was really her uncle, her father's brother, making their love <b>incestuous</b> and their <b>children</b> the product of incest. When Corrine finally returns to the children that night, she is forced to show the children that she had been savagely bullwhipped by her mother as punishment for her marrying her uncle and having children from the union. Corrine confesses to the children that she and their father were niece and uncle, and her parents were livid as they believed Corrine disgraced the family; the children do not say anything but seem to accept it. Corrine tells the children that her parents made it clear that if she had any children by her uncle she would be disinherited, but because her father doesn't know about them she still has a chance to get the money when he passes away. She says that their confinement will only be for a short time: her father is deathly ill, and once she is able to convince him to secure her inheritance, they will be free and they will leave.|$|R
