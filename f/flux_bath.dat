40|$|Ouabain and lithium {{decrease}} acidification in open-circuited bladders {{by eliminating}} the electrical gradient favoring acidification. The effect of ouabain and lithium on acidification in cortical and medullary collecting tubules derived from starved New Zealand white rabbits was studied by using the techniques of isolated nephron microperfusion and microcalorimetric determination of total CO 2 <b>flux.</b> <b>Bath</b> and perfusion solutions were symmetric throughout all studies, and solutions contained 25 meq of bicarbonate and were bubbled with 93. 3 % O 2 / 6. 7 % CO 2 gas mixtures. In cortical collecting tubules, ouabain (10 (- 8) M) addition to bath resulted in a decrease in both potential difference (PD), from - 16. 4 to - 2. 2 mV (P less than 0. 001), and total CO 2 flux (JTCO 2), from + 6. 0 to 1. 5 pmol/mm per min (P less than 0. 005). In medullary collecting tubules neither PD nor JTCO 2 changed {{with the addition of}} ouabain in either 10 (- 8) or 10 (- 4) M concentration. Replacement of 40 mM NaCl with 40 mM LiCl in both perfusate and bath in cortical collecting tubules resulted in decreases in both PD, from - 11. 6 to 0. 4 mV (P less than 0. 005), and JTCO 2, from + 10. 8 to + 4. 2 pmol/mm per min (P less than 0. 025). This substitution had no effect on medullary collecting tubules. When control flux rates were plotted against animal bladder urine pH, both medullary and cortical tubules showed good inverse correlation between these variables, with higher values of flux rate for the medullary tubules. The data support a role for transepithelial PD in acidification in the cortical collecting tubule and also suggest that both cortical and medullary segments of the collecting tubule participate when urinary acidification is increased during starvation in the rabbit...|$|E

40|$|We {{developed}} an experimental model {{to study the}} permeability of individual retinal vessels in vitro using microperfusion techniques adapted from kidney tubule studies. The retinal vessels were isolated by freehand dissection and mounted on a microperfusion apparatus. When inulin was perfused luminally, it was diluted to 80. 2 +/- 2. 3 % of its initial concentration. However, no radioactive leak into the bath side was observed, suggesting that the dilution was due to fluid <b>flux</b> from <b>bath</b> to lumen. The dilution of fluorescein (81. 9 +/- 3. 8 %) {{was in the same}} range as that of inulin, the reference marker. The extremely low lumen-to-bath fluorescein flux, 0. 5 +/- 0. 9 X 10 (- 12) mol/min/mm, increased by 68 % when probenecid was added to the perfusate and by 210 % when probenecid was placed in the bath. The effect was concentration- dependent. When placed in the bath, fluorescein moved rapidly across the retinal vessel walls, accumulating in the lumen to concentrations 40 times higher than in the bath. This movement from bath to lumen, which was much higher (13. 6 +/- 0. 3 X 10 (- 12) mol/min/mm) than the lumen-to-bath fluorescein flux for the same fluorescein concentration, decreased by adding probenecid to the bath. The kinetics of this unidirectional movement of fluorescein were consistent with a saturable active transport process. The fluid <b>flux</b> from <b>bath</b> to lumen across the retinal vessels, which was 6. 3 +/- 1. 0 nl/min/mm for perfusion rates of 6. 6 +/- 0. 2 nl/min, was temperature-dependent and was coupled to the fluorescein transport. Fluorescein stimulated the fluid flux by 17 % when added to the perfusate and by 60 % when added to the bath, and this effect could be reversed by probenecid. Our results showed an active transport of fluorescein in the rabbit retinal vessels coupled with net fluid flux from outside the vessels into the lume...|$|R
40|$|We {{show how}} the Gillespie algorithm, {{originally}} developed to describe coupled chemical reactions, {{can be used to}} perform numerical simulations of a granular intruder particle colliding with thermalized bath particles. The algorithm generates a sequence of collision ``events'' separated by variable time intervals.

We validate the method by applying it to a one-dimensional system for which the exact solution of the homogeneous Boltzmann equation is known and investigate the case where the bath particle velocity distribution has algebraic tails.

In particular, we consider a ring-shaped incommensurate charge density wave (ICDW ring) threaded by a fluctuating magnetic flux: the Caldeira-Leggett model is used to model the fluctuating <b>flux</b> as a <b>bath</b> of harmonic oscillators. We show that the charge density expectation value of a quantized ICDW ring coupled to its environment oscillates periodically.

The source also varied by about 30 per cent during the observation, confirming the presence of a type 1 nucleus in its centre.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the dynamics of}} a small long-range interacting system, in contact with a large long-range thermal bath. Our analysis reveals the existence of striking anomalies in the energy <b>flux</b> between the <b>bath</b> and the system. In particular, {{we find that the}} evolution of the system is not influenced by the kinetic temperature of the bath, as opposed to what happens for short-range collisional systems. As a consequence, the system may get hotter also when its initial temperature is larger than the bath temperature. This observation is explained quantitatively in the framework of the collisionless Vlasov description of toy models with long-range interactions and shown to be valid whenever the Vlasov picture applies, from cosmology to plasma physics. © 2013 American Physical Society.

40|$|In {{order to}} collect direct {{information}} {{on the nature of}} the countercurrent multiplier we isolated descending limbs of the loop of Henle in the rabbit inner medulla and perfused them in vitro. The transepithelial electrical resistance was high with a mean exceeding 700 Ω cm 2 a value typical of tight epithelia. The sodium permeability, calculated from the lumen to <b>bath</b> <b>fluxes</b> of 22 Na was very low: 1. 7 x 10 - 6 cm·sec- 1. Batches of dissected descending limbs were processed for freeze-fracture electron microscopy. The tight junctions in this segment were characteristic of tight epithelia. Thus functional and morphological evidence indicates that this region of the nephron does not permit free passage of NaCl.

The present in vitro studies on isolated perfused rabbit proximal convoluted tubules were designed to examine whether protein concentration gradient must act across the peritubular capillary membrane to influence reabsorption, or whether it can exert a direct effect across the tubular basement membrane 71 proximal tubules were perfused with ultrafiltrate made isosmolal to bathing fluids, the latter having identical electrolyte composition as the perfusing ultrafiltrate, but adjusted to three oncotic pressures: hypooncotic, protein 0. 0 g/ 100 ml; control isooncotic serum, protein 6. 4 g/ 100 ml; and hyperoncotic, protein 12. 5 g/ 100 ml.

When the bath was hypooncotic, there was (as compared with isooncotic serum) a significant decrease in net volume (38 %) and net sodium (40 %) flux, but no change in PNa, Purea, or transtubular potential; however, Psucrose increased significantly (78 %).

This in vitro preparation is polarized so that apical and basolateral secretions can be collected separately. The unstimulated amylase flux from cell to bath was substantial at the initial rate (approximately three times the concurrent apical <b>flux).</b> With time, <b>bath</b> amylase approached a steady-state concentration, suggesting an equilbrating process. During the same time interval, ductal amylase secretion remained constant. At the steady state, the amylase concentration in the bath was at least {{an order of magnitude}} less than its ductal concentration. Hourly replacement of bathing medium reproduced the initial rate of amylase release into the bath for five consecutive hours. Pancreozymin (cholecystokinin), a peptide hormone, did not alter the steady-state bath amylase content, although it greatly augmented ductal amylase secretion. In contrast, a cholinergic agonist greatly increased both the flux from the cell to bath and the ductal secretion of amylase. Taken together, these results indicate a natural bidirectional permeability of the basolateral membrane to digestive enzyme and support evidence previously obtained suggesting that such a permeability might exist...|$|R
40|$|These studies {{indicate}} that tetraethylammonium (TEA) is transported by saturable processes from bath to lumen and lumen to bath in isolated, perfused snake (Thamnophis spp.) proximal renal tubules and that the unidirectional <b>flux</b> from <b>bath</b> to lumen (Jᵇ¹(TEA)) exceeds the unidirectional flux from lumen to bath (J¹ᵇ (TEA)) at all TEA concentrations studied. In order to examine the transport process further, the effects of N¹-methylnicotinamide (NMN), temperature, sodium cyanide, {{and the removal of}} Na⁺ on TEA transport were studied. Steady-state Jᵇ¹(TEA) (103. 2 ± 1. 1 fmoles min⁻¹ mm⁻¹ at {TEA}(b) = 8. 1 μM) was inhibited by 50 % at {NMN}(b) = 4. 0 mM. When TEA and NMN were present in the lumen, J¹ᵇ (TEA) was depressed initially (T < 8 min). However, at steady-state, the presence of NMN in the lumen appeared to stimulate J¹ᵇ (TEA). This suggests a trans-stimulation effect of NMN on J¹ᵇ (TEA). During some flux experiments tubules were perfused at room temperature (24 °C) and then cooled to 2. 8 °C. Jᵇ¹(TEA) decreased approximately 25 % when compared to control values. This effect was reversible. Other tubules were perfused in the presence of 2. 5 mM sodium cyanide in the perfusate and bath. Cellular concentrations of TEA dropped from 67 to 27 times the bath concentration during Jᵇ¹(TEA) measurements and from 21 to 6 times the mean luminal concentration during J¹ᵇ (TEA) measurements. This indicates that little if any intracellular binding of TEA occurs, as passive accumulation should be 16. 1 times the bath or lumen TEA concentration (assuming a - 70 mV PD). To determine if TEA transport was dependent on the presence of Na⁺, Na⁺ in the bath and perfusate solutions was replaced isosmotically by sucrose. Jᵇ¹(TEA) was not significantly changed in the absence of Na⁺. J¹ᵇ (TEA) decreased to 56 % of control in the absence of Na⁺. This effect was reversible. Thus, J¹ᵇ (TEA) is Na⁺-dependent and Jᵇ¹(TEA) is not. These data suggest that the transport characteristics of the carrier for TEA at the luminal and peritubular membranes of the distal-proximal tubules of garter snakes are dissimilar...|$|R

40|$|Electronic {{packaging}} {{industries are}} now in great challenge to find a suitable lead-free solder as an interconnection material to replace the conventional SnPb solders. Many solders such as SnCu, SnAg, SnAgCu, SnZn, SnBi have already been proposed as the replacement {{but none of them}} has reached the physical and metallurgical properties similar to the SnPb solder. However, wetting is one of the basic problems that make the lead-free solder inferior as compared to the SnPb solder. Therefore, alloying with the help of third, fourth or fifth element is the researchers' interest to improve the wetting behavior of lead-free solders. This paper describes the comparative wetting behavior of Sn- 0. 7 Cu and Sn- 0. 7 Cu- 0. 3 Ni solders on Cu and Ni substrates. Wetting balance tests were performed to assess the wetting behaviors. Three different commercial fluxes namely no-clean (NC), non-activated (R) and water soluble organic acid (WS) fluxes were used to assess the wettability for three solder bath temperatures. It was found that Sn 0. 7 Cu- 03 Ni solder exhibits better wettability on Cu substrate for NC and WS fluxes whereas reverse results were found for R-type flux. In the case of Ni substrate, Sn- 0. 7 Cu- 0. 3 Ni solder showed better wetting behavior compared to the well-known Sn- 0. 7 Cu solder. Among the three fluxes, R-type flux showed the worst performance. Very large contact angles were documented for both solders with this <b>flux.</b> Higher solder <b>bath</b> temperature lowered the contact angles, increased the wetting forces and enhanced the wettability.

Both Jv, and Ve, {{were reduced to}} zero at 21 °C or with 10 - 4 M ouabain, but Jv, was not HCO 3 - dependent. Net Na+ reabsorption, measured as the difference between 22 Na+ <b>fluxes,</b> lumen to <b>bath</b> and bath to lumen, accounted quantitatively for volume reabsorption, assuming the latter to be an isotonic process, and was {{in agreement with the}} difference between lumen to <b>bath</b> 22 Na+ <b>fluxes</b> during volume reabsorption and at zero volume flow. The observed flux ratio for Na+ was 1. 46, and that predicted for a passive process was 0. 99; thus, Na+ reabsorption was rationalized in terms of an active transport process. The Cl- concentration of tubular fluid rose from 113. 6 to 132. 3 mM during volume reabsorption. Since Ve, rose to + 0. 82 mV when tubules were perfused with 138. 6 mM Cl- solutions, Ve may become positive when tubular fluid Cl- concentrations rise during volume reabsorption.

The magnitudes of the potentials were the same for a given NaCl gradient in either direction and PNa/PCl was constant in the range 32 – 139 mM NaCl.

40|$|Oxygen {{steelmaking}} {{is complex}} {{because of the}} presence of multiple phases, many components, and the non-steady state/non-homogenous conditions within the process. The severe operating conditions make it difficult to take measurements and directly observe the process. Although some mathematical models have been developed to describe the kinetics of oxygen steelmaking, improve understanding of the system and optimize process control, existing theories have not been successfully applied under dynamic process conditions. For example, there is evidence that the period when the bloated droplets are suspended in the emulsion phase enhances the reaction areas, and the decarburization rates. In this study a computer based model has been developed that incorporates bloated droplet theory under dynamic conditions to evaluate its influence on the overall kinetics of the process. The process variables influencing the decarburization reaction kinetics considered in the model were hot metal, scrap and flux charges, hot metal, scrap and slag compositions, oxygen blowing conditions, temperature of the <b>bath,</b> <b>flux</b> dissolution, scrap melting, the droplet generation rate, droplet size, residence time of droplets in the emulsion, and decarburization rates in the emulsion and impact zones. These process variables were modelled individually. The equations involved in this model were solved numerically on the basis of parameters encountered in the operation of oxygen steelmaking furnaces. All the developed models were translated into computational code and linked to one another in this study. The global model was tested with actual data for a 200 t top-blown furnace under the full scale operating conditions. The model predictions proved that the carbon content of liquid iron agreed with the actual process data. The model suggests that 45 % of total carbon was removed via emulsified metal droplets and the remainder was removed from the impact zone during the entire blow. It was found that the residence time of droplets and the decarburization reaction rate via emulsified droplets, was a strong function of the bloating behavior of the droplets. The estimated residence times of the metal droplets in the emulsion were between 0. 4 and 45 seconds throughout the blow. The global model enabled a comparison of the decarburization rates in different reaction zones and provided a better understanding of the process variables affecting in each reaction zone. On the basis of this model, the decarburization rates in the emulsion phase reached 60 % of the overall decarburization rate during the main blow. These findings will provide a further theoretical understanding of the oxygen steelmaking process and provide a predictive tool for industrial applications. This development represents an original contribution to our understanding of steelmaking...|$|R
