50|$|After leaving <b>Gypsi</b> in 1982, Champion {{returned}} {{to the private sector}} and was recruited for a band to back Jamaican singer/songwriter Carlean Davis for her North American tour. Her EP release featured two songs written by Champion, and was reviewed in the “College Musical Journal” (CMJ). Soon after college stations nationwide were requesting promo copies for programming.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to Mitzie, four other dolphins were filmed {{for the production}} of the movie. Two of the dolphins, Little Bit, a female, and Mr. Gipper, a male, reproduced at the Dolphin Research Center. The calf was named Tursi, and she still lives at Dolphin Research Center as of 2011. Tursi has four offspring also living at Dolphin Research Center: Talon, Pax, <b>Gypsi</b> and Gambit.|$|E
5000|$|She {{has been}} called [...] "the {{greatest}} Spanish <b>gypsi</b> dancer of her generation" [...] and [...] "the most extraordinary personality of all time in flamenco dance". [...] She was the first female flamenco dancer to master some of the fastest and most furious footwork {{that had previously been}} reserved for a few male dancers. Amaya was one of the female dancers to sometimes perform flamenco in high-waisted trousers as a symbol to the strong character.|$|E
50|$|Before {{graduating from}} Chicago’s Columbia College, Champion {{went to work}} at a couple of Michigan Ave ad {{agencies}} in the day and playing music at night. He was approached by a songwriter from the island of St Kitts to record at Bob Marley’s Tuff Gong Studio in Kingston, Jamaica.  With <b>Gypsi</b> in 1982, he recorded his first release titled “The Girls” for Obvio Records at Paul Serrano Studios in Chicago. Gypsi-Fari also won the first awards from the Chicago Music Awards in 1982.|$|E
50|$|The Concurso {{was held}} {{on the grounds of}} the Alhambra, at the Plaza de Aljibes on the palace's west end, {{overlooking}} the Torre Bermeja and the old city of Granada to the southwest; to the north lay the rising slopes of the Sacromonte (the <b>Gypsi</b> quarter). Perfumed by cypress trees, and with French lavender scattered on the ground for the event, the plaza lay across the crest of a ridge, to which one ascended, entering by way of the Torre de la Justicia. It was decorated for the occasion by the artist Ignacio Zuloaga, whose visual display employed brilliant embroidered textiles and mantones capes of Andalucia. After sundown the plaza setting would become a colorful region of lights beside the Arab palace.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} the song cycles <b>Gypsi</b> Melodies op. 55 (1880) and Biblical Songs op. 99 (1894) by Antonín Dvořák. The main {{question is how}} the composer musically reads the text and how he represents and further develops its sense. Two musical settings of Adolf Heydukʼs poems Cigánské melodie (1859) {{are discussed in the}} first part: At first <b>Gypsi</b> Melodies, a cycle of fourteen songs by Karel Bendl written in 1861 - 62 and 1875 that also provides context for Dvořákʼs <b>Gypsi</b> Melodies, and then the latter song cycle by A. Dvořák. Both works are analysed in detail and compositional principles of musical setting of the sense of the text are characterized. Some paralels as well as differences are to be found not only in the two ways of setting the same texts but also in more general terms. Another topic discussed are the certain ways of representing the idea of the exotic in Bendlʼs and Dvořákʼs <b>Gypsi</b> Melodies. In the second part Dvořák's musical setting of the sense of words in his Biblical Songs is described and explained. The certain principles used (concerning musical developing of the atmosphere and its changes and representing the sense of some particular words) are rather similar to the compositional approach to the text in his <b>Gypsi</b> melodies {{as well as in the}} other songs researched (Dvořákʼs [...] ...|$|E
