50|$|Annabergite is an arsenate mineral {{consisting}} of a hydrous nickelarsenate, Ni3(AsO4)2·8H2O, crystallizing in the monoclinic system and isomorphous with vivianite and <b>erythrite.</b> Crystals are minute and capillary and rarely met with, the mineral occurring usually as soft earthy masses and encrustations. A fine apple-green colour is its characteristic feature. It was long known (since 1758) under the name nickel bloom; the name annabergite was proposed by H. J. Brooke and W H. Miller in 1852, from Annaberg in Saxony, one of the localities of the mineral. It occurs with ores of nickel, {{of which it is}} a product of alteration. A variety, from Creetown in Kirkcudbrightshire, in which a portion of the nickel is replaced by calcium, has been called dudgeonite, after P. Dudgeon, who found it.|$|E
5000|$|Köttigite {{is a rare}} {{hydrated}} zinc arsenate {{which was}} discovered in 1849 and named by James Dwight Dana in 1850 in honour of Otto Friedrich Köttig (1824 - 1892), a German chemist from Schneeberg, Saxony, who made the first chemical analysis of the mineral. [...] It has the formula Zn3(AsO4)2·8H2O {{and it is a}} dimorph of metaköttigite, which means that the two minerals have the same formula, but a different structure: köttigite is monoclinic and metaköttigite is triclinic. There are several minerals with similar formulae but with other cations in place of the zinc. Iron forms parasymplesite Fe2+3(AsO4)2·8H2O; cobalt forms the distinctively coloured pinkish purple mineral <b>erythrite</b> Co3(AsO4)2·8H2O and nickel forms annabergite Ni3(AsO4)2·8H2O. Köttigite forms series with all three of these minerals and they are all members of the vivianite group.|$|E
50|$|Arsenate-reducing {{bacteria}} are bacteria which reduce arsenates. Arsenate-reducing {{bacteria are}} ubiquitous in arsenic-contaminated groundwater (aqueous environment).Arsenates are salts or esters of arsenic acid (H3AsO4), {{consisting of the}} ion AsO43−. They are moderate oxidizers that {{can be reduced to}} arsenites and to arsine. Arsenate can serve as a respiratory electron acceptor for oxidation of organic substrates and H2S or H2.Arsenates occur naturally in minerals such as adamite, alarsite, legrandite, and <b>erythrite,</b> and as hydrated or anhydrous arsenates. Arsenates are similar to phosphates since arsenic (As) and phosphorus (P) occur in group 15 (or VA) of the periodic table. Unlike phosphates, arsenates are not readily lost from minerals due to weathering. They are the predominant form of inorganic arsenic in aqueous aerobic environments. On the other hand, arsenite is more common in anaerobic environments, more mobile, and more toxic than arsenate. Arsenite is 25-60 times more toxic and more mobile than arsenate under most environmental conditions.Arsenate can lead to poisoning, since it can replace inorganic phosphate in the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate --> 1,3-biphosphoglycerate step of glycolysis, producing 1-arseno-3-phosphoglycerate instead. Although glycolysis continues, 1 ATP molecule is lost. Thus, arsenate is toxic due to its ability to uncouple glycolysis.Arsenate can also inhibit pyruvate conversion into acetyl-CoA, thereby blocking the TCA cycle, resulting in additional loss of ATP.|$|E
50|$|The Silver Glen lies {{approximately}} 1 km to {{the east}} of the town of Alva, Clackmannanshire, Scotland, and takes its name from the silver that was mined there in the early 18th century. The story of the silver mine is a remarkable one. The deposit, the richest deposit of native silver ever found in the British Isles, was discovered just as the Jacobite rising of 1715 was breaking out, and its owner, Sir John Erskine, left to join the rebels, leaving his wife in charge of the mine. Some 40 tons of ore were raised and buried in barrels in the grounds of Alva House, whilst the richest of the ore was smelted and the ingots concealed under floorboards inside the house. The mine was then filled in during the aftermath of the failed rising, but its existence was revealed to the government by an employee of the Erskines. Samples of the ore were analysed by Sir Isaac Newton and found to be very rich. Sir John was later able to secure a pardon {{for his role in the}} rising, on condition he revealed all he knew about the mine, and gave a tenth of the proceeds to the government. Mining resumed a few years later and the remainder of the deposit was extracted. Later, in 1759, a vein carrying <b>erythrite,</b> an ore of cobalt, was found and gave a new lease of life to the mines, but it was soon exhausted.|$|E

Trends in Raman band positions of the antisymmetric arsenate stretching vibrations are sensitive to the site occupancy of metal ions in the crystal structure. Changes in the crystal morphology, unit-cell parameters and vibrational spectra have been rationalized in terms of the site occupancy of Co and Ni in the crystal structure. Substitution of Ni is directed to metal site 1 (C 2 h site symmetry) whereas Co is directed to metal site 2 (C 2 site symmetry).

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the {{vibrational}} spectroscopy of the aragonite and vivianite arsenate minerals (<b>erythrite,</b> annabergite and hörnesite), specifically the assignment of the spectra. The infrared and Raman spectra of cerussite have been assigned according to the vibrational symmetry species. The assignment of satellite bands to 18 O isotopes has been discussed {{with respect to the}} use of these bands to the quantification of the isotopes. Overtone and combination bands have been assigned according to symmetry species and their corresponding fundamental vibrations. The vibrational spectra of cerussite have been compared with other aragonite group minerals and the differences explained on the basis of differing chemistry and crystal structures of these minerals. The single crystal spectra of natural <b>erythrite</b> has been reported and compared with the synthetic equivalent. The symmetry species of the vibrations have been assigned according to single crystal and factor group considerations. Deuteration experiments have allowed the assignment of water vibrational freque ncies to discrete water molecules in the crystal structure. Differences in the spectra of other vivianite arsenates, namely annabergite and hörnesite, have been explained by consideration of their differing chemistry and crystal structures. A novel approach to the assignment of site occupancy of ions in the <b>erythrite</b> - annabergite solid solution has been reported. This approach has utilised vibrational spectroscopy, in conjunction with careful consideration of the crystal structures of the minerals. It has been shown that in the <b>erythrite</b> - annabergite solid solution Coprefers metal site 2 contrasting nickel which prefers site 1. This study in conjunction with other studies has yielded the trend that the more electronegative metal prefers to occupy site 1, with the least electronegative metal preferring to occupy site 2. Fundamentally this thesis has increased the knowledge base of the spectroscopic properties of the aragonite and the vivianite minerals. The site occupancy of metal ion substitutions in solid solution series of the vivianite group of minerals has been further enhanced, with novel method of studying the site occupancy of ions in solid solutions has been developed.

These layers are connected by hydrogen bonds. The average [6] = 2. 122 (1) Å and average [6] = 2. 088 (1) Å.

In these As- and P-series, using data from this study and from the literature, we find that their structural parameters evolve linearly with V and in a nearly parallel manner despite of the large difference in size between P 5 + (0. 170 Å) and As 5 + (0. 355 Å) cations. Average [4], [6], and [6] distances increase linearly with V. The average distance is affected by M atoms, whereas the average distance is unaffected because it contains shorter and stronger P–O bonds.
