25|$|The amiable Rev.

500|$|Regarding her nationality, Watts has stated: [...] "I {{consider}} myself British and have very happy {{memories of the}} UK.

[...] She also has expressed her ties to Australia, declaring: [...] "I {{consider myself}} very connected to Australia, in fact when people say where is <b>home,</b> <b>I</b> say Australia, because those are my most powerful memories." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to learning law from Tuttle, Hobart {{fell in love}} with his daughter. [...] Jennie Tuttle Hobart remembered, [...] "When this attractive young law student appeared in our <b>home</b> <b>I,</b> then a young girl in my teens, unexpectedly played a rôle of importance by losing my heart to him". [...] The two were married on July 21, 1869. [...] The Hobarts had long been Democrats; Garret Hobart's marriage into the Republican Tuttle family converted him to that party. [...] The couple had four children, two of whom survived infancy. [...] One daughter, Fannie, died in 1895; Hobart's son, Garret Jr. survived him.|$|E
500|$|Of her {{research}} for Falls the Shadow, Penman explains: [...] "I {{did a great}} deal of on-site research, visiting the castles and battlefields that figured in Falls the Shadow, visiting the Reading Room at the British Library, the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth, and local reference libraries… Here at <b>home,</b> <b>I</b> made use of the University of Pennsylvania Library in Philadelphia, which has an excellent medieval selection. But it really helped to see the scenes for myself. At Lewes, we actually walked along the same path that Simon de Montfort and his men would have followed. It was breathtaking to stand on the Downs, gazing out upon the same view that he would have seen".|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics to}} the first verse of [...] "Born Again" [...] were written while Third Day's lead singer, Mac Powell, was folding laundry.

All of a sudden it just came out--a full first verse literally. It wasn’t like I said a line and worked out a few other lines, it literally just came out. I just spoke it and sang it and it scared me because that never happens". Powell said he then [...] "got up and I was running around the house, throwing stuff everywhere looking for a pen and a piece of paper".|$|E

500|$|Peter Thompson, {{the head}} of the U.K. Electoral Observation Mission in the country for the election, {{described}} the situation {{on the night of the}} coup as [...] "a very large presence of the military in the streets. It did seem quite coordinated last night in terms of how the roads were shut off...Today the streets are very calm, the city is much quieter than it normally would be. People are staying <b>home.</b> <b>I</b> do know that the army has taken control of the state media and state television, and they haven't released anything official." [...] There was speculation on Senegal's RFM radio by reporter Noah Mankali that Gomes Júnior had been assassinated by the army during the night by soldiers from the same Balanta ethnic group as Ialá Embaló.|$|E
500|$|Faced with a {{mortgage}} and a $2,000-per-month alimony obligation {{as a result}} of his 1969 divorce, he began to support himself largely by giving college lectures and appearances at science fiction conventions. [...] According to Arthur C. Clarke, [...] "After attending , Gene introduced himself and told me that his series was being cancelled because the television executives, in their inscrutable wisdom, had decided that there was no audience for it. Poor Gene was broke and about to mortgage his <b>home.</b> <b>I</b> introduced him to my lecture agent, who was skeptical but booked him into a small hall -- which couldn't hold the audience he attracted." [...] Although the geographical distance imposed by Clarke's residence in Sri Lanka resulted in only a handful of physical meetings, Roddenberry would later characterize their friendship as [...] "the most significant of my professional life.” ...|$|E
500|$|Davies {{would later}} comment in his autobiography, X-Ray, that Anning later [...] "told {{me that he}} ... knew it [...] had been partly {{inspired}} by him ... reminded him of <b>home</b> ... <b>I</b> told Arthur that I felt guilty for using him as a subject for a song, but he shrugged off my apology, {{saying that he was}} flattered." [...] With an underlying theme of nostalgia, the songs describe the England that Arthur once knew ("Victoria", [...] "Young and Innocent Days"), the promise of life in Australia for one of his sons ("Australia"), the emptiness of his superficially comfortable life in his home ("Shangri-La"), the resolve of the British people during the Second World War ("Mr. Churchill Says"), the privations that marked the austerity period after the war ("She's Bought a Hat Like Princess Marina"), and the death of his brother in World War I ("Yes Sir, No Sir", [...] "Some Mother's Son").|$|E

500|$|Gaga first {{performed}} [...] "Gypsy" [...] on a {{grand piano}} for guests at a listening party for Artpop in Berlin's Berghain nightclub. She said of the song: [...] "I wrote this song as I was travelling around the world... They say 'a Gypsy doesn't have a home.' But I do have a <b>home.</b> <b>I</b> have a home with you always." [...] Seated atop a piano wearing a bra and short blond hair, Gaga performed an acoustic version of the song, singing with a heavy German accent while sporting a moustache. Brenna Ehlrich of MTV noted that: [...] "Throughout the performance, fans looked on with tears in their eyes, watching as Gaga unfurled the simple love story with nothing but her voice and piano." [...] Malene Arpe, entertainment contributor to the Toronto Star, said her performance was goosebump-inducing and caused viewers {{to forget about the}} moustache [...] "right {{in the middle of her}} face." ...|$|E
500|$|Cliff White of NME {{called the}} album [...] "almost a voyeur's delight", {{and was not}} {{favorable}} of Gaye's sensual themes, stating [...] "Although getting down, getting mellow, and getting it on are paramount considerations {{in the privacy of}} my own <b>home,</b> <b>I</b> don't particularly want to be party to someone else's night life. Not on record anyway... Like peeking through the windows of the Gaye residence in the wee wee hours. Perhaps that's your kick, but personally I find it a mite frustrating." [...] White also criticized the album's sound, describing the songs as [...] "all expressions of the same mood. Sensual, satisfied, and spaced out", and calling I Want You [...] "simply the explorative aftermath of Let's Get It On. The sweet nuthin's of a drowsy, sweat-streaked lover." [...] Robert Christgau of The Village Voice wrote favorably of the album's sound quality. However, he criticized the lyrical content, as well as Ware's involvement in songwriting, stating [...] "was it Ware who instructed Marvin to eliminate all depth and power from his voice? I mean, if you're into insisting on sex it's in bad taste to whine about it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{party were}} further slowed {{down by the}} {{frostbite}} in Oates' left foot - daily marches were now down to less than five miles, which was insufficient {{given the lack of}} oil. Furthermore, by March 10 it became evident the dog teams were not coming: [...] "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [...] had a bad trip <b>home</b> <b>I</b> suppose." [...] In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated March 16, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support." [...] On the same day, Oates, who [...] "now with hands as well as feet pretty well useless", voluntarily left the tent and walked to his death. Scott wrote that Oates' last words were [...] "I am just going outside and may be some time".|$|E

500|$|U2's manager Paul McGuinness recounted that The Joshua Tree {{originated}} from the band's [...] "great romance" [...] with the United States, {{as the group}} had toured the country {{for up to five}} months per year {{in the first half of}} the 1980s. Leading up to the album sessions, lead vocalist Bono had been reading the works of American writers such as Norman Mailer, Flannery O'Connor, and Raymond Carver so as to understand, in the words of Hot Press editor Niall Stokes, [...] "those on the fringes of the promised land, cut off from the American dream". Following a September–October 1985 humanitarian visit to Egypt and Ethiopia with his wife Ali, Bono said, [...] "Spending time in Africa and seeing people in the pits of poverty, I still saw a very strong spirit in the people, a richness of spirit I didn't see when I came <b>home...</b> <b>I</b> saw the spoiled child of the Western world. I started thinking, 'They may have a physical desert, but we've got other kinds of deserts.' And that's what attracted me to the desert as a symbol of some sort." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} {{began to have}} doubts about the record's sound. [...] During this time, Cobain admitted, [...] "The first time I played it at <b>home,</b> <b>I</b> knew there was {{something}} wrong. [...] The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. [...] I got no emotion from it, I was just numb." [...] The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. [...] The producer declined; as he recalled, [...] " [...] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.' [...] And I don't think he felt he had that yet... My problem was that I feared a slippery slope." [...] The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine. [...] Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.|$|E
500|$|Chopra saw {{the deal}} as an {{opportunity}} to represent South Asia and challenge Indian stereotypes in Hollywood and the United States, saying: [...] "When I was in school , you never saw anyone who looked like us that was on TV. And that was really weird for me because there's so many people of South Asian descent in America – in the world. I didn't want to be this stereotype of what Indian people are usually seen as in global pop culture. We don't just have to be Apu from The Simpsons." [...] After being given all 26 pilot scripts which ABC was filming for the 2015–2016 television season, she chose Quantico. The actress, who had appeared in over fifty films at that time, was required to audition for the first time, which she found nerve-wracking. Safran was impressed by Chopra's audition, which helped him re-envision the character, adding [...] "She walked into the room, and it was like the molecules shifted in that way that superstars have. I was very confused because I didn't know who she was, but we all sat up straighter. We're like this is clearly a movie star; it's like every {{hair on the back of}} your neck stands up watching her act. When I went back <b>home</b> <b>I</b> couldn't think about anyone else." [...] Chopra became the first South Asian to headline an American network drama series.|$|E

500|$|Such was {{the quality}} of Henson's {{scholarship}} that his history tutor encouraged him to enter the annual competition for appointment as a Fellow of All Souls, the university's post-graduate research college. He was appointed in November 1884, {{at the age of}} twenty. Membership of the college offered an annual stipend of £200; for the first time, Henson was in reasonably comfortable financial circumstances. At All Souls, he later wrote, [...] "I was welcomed with a generous kindness which made me feel immediately at <b>home.</b> <b>I</b> formed friendships which have enriched my life." [...] His biographer John Peart-Binns suggests that Henson may nonetheless have remained something of an outsider, his arrival at All Souls [...] "akin to that of an alien". The college was headed by the Warden, Sir William Anson, who became something of a father figure to Henson, and encouraged his researches. Henson's first paper, on William II of England, marked him out as not only a fine scholar but a gripping speaker when he delivered it to an audience. Aware that his quick tongue could lead him into indiscretion, he adopted and maintained all his life the practice of writing out his lectures and sermons in full beforehand rather than improvising or speaking from concise notes. He preferred a quill pen, and wrote in a fine clear hand; he considered illegible writing to be a form of bad manners as tiresome as inaudible talking. He gained a reputation as a controversialist. In a biographical sketch, Harold Begbie wrote that at Oxford Henson was nicknamed [...] "Coxley Cocksure"; he added: ...|$|E
500|$|The UK {{government}} {{and the international community}} ultimately declared the February 1980 general election free and fair, though many observers attested to widespread political violence and intimidation of voters, particularly by ZANU (which added Patriotic Front to its name to become [...] "ZANU–PF"). British monitors in the ZANU–PF-dominated eastern provinces were strongly critical, reporting [...] "brutal 'disciplinary murders' as examples of the fate awaiting those who failed to conform", name-taking and [...] "claims to the possession of machines which would reveal how individuals had voted". The Commonwealth Observer Group acknowledged that irregularities were occurring but ruled that accounts were exaggerated. After the RF won all 20 white seats, Soames announced late on 4 March 1980 that Mugabe and ZANU–PF had won 57 of the 80 common roll seats, giving them a majority in the new House of Assembly. Mugabe invited Smith to his house that evening and according to Smith treated him [...] "most courteously"; Mugabe expressed joy at inheriting a [...] "wonderful country" [...] with modern infrastructure and a viable economy, outlined plans for gradual reform that Smith found reasonable, and said that he hoped to stay in regular contact. This meeting {{had a profound effect on}} the former Prime Minister. Having denounced Mugabe as an [...] "apostle of Satan" [...] before the election, Smith now publicly endorsed him as [...] "sober and responsible". [...] "If this were a true picture, then there could be hope instead of despair," [...] he recalled in his autobiography. [...] "When I got <b>home</b> <b>I</b> said to Janet that I hoped it was not an hallucination." ...|$|E
500|$|On {{the return}} {{journey from the}} Pole, Scott reached the 82.30°S meeting point for the dog teams, three days ahead of schedule, noting in his diary for 27 February 1912 [...] "We are {{naturally}} always discussing possibility of meeting dogs, where and when, etc. It is a critical position. We may find ourselves in safety at the next depot, {{but there is a}} horrid element of doubt." [...] By 10 March the temperature had dropped unexpectedly to below , and it became evident the dog teams were not coming: [...] "The dogs which would have been our salvation have evidently failed. Meares [...] had a bad trip <b>home</b> <b>I</b> suppose. It's a miserable jumble." [...] With 400miles (670km) still to travel across the Ross Ice Shelf, Scott's party's prospects steadily worsened as, with deteriorating weather, a puzzling lack of fuel in the depots, hunger and exhaustion, they struggled northward. In a farewell letter to Sir Edgar Speyer, dated 16 March, Scott wondered whether he had overshot the meeting point and fought the growing suspicion that he had in fact been abandoned by the dog teams: [...] "We very nearly came through, and it's a pity to have missed it, but lately I have felt that we have overshot our mark. No-one is to blame and I hope no attempt will be made to suggest that we had lacked support." [...] On the same day, Oates, whose toes had become frostbitten, voluntarily left the tent and walked to his death. Scott wrote that Oates' last words were [...] "I am just going outside and may be some time".|$|E
