2500|$|In 1931 {{the first}} {{practical}} roadside breath-testing device was the drunkometer developed by Rolla Neil <b>Harger</b> of the Indiana University School of Medicine. The drunkometer collected a motorist's breath sample {{directly into a}} balloon inside the machine. The breath sample was then pumped through an acidified potassium permanganate solution. If there was alcohol in the breath sample, the solution changed color. The greater the color change, the more alcohol there was present in the breath. [...] The drunkometer was manufactured and sold by Stephenson Corporation of Red Bank, New Jersey.|$|E

He defended himself against the view that it should be Ward's right to succeed his father.|$|R

5000|$|James <b>Hargest</b> Junior Campus was {{formerly}} known as Rosedale Intermediate School until it {{became part of the}} former James <b>Hargest</b> High School to make James <b>Hargest</b> College as part of the Ministry of Education review of schools in 2004.

Because of this, a new technology block has been built, and several new classrooms have been built since the merge. There are over 25 homeroom classrooms.The subjects in the New Technology Block (known as the Atrium) include Science, Art, Woodwork, Foods & Textiles technology, and an ICT & Media Suite.|$|R

500|$|When gliders {{containing}} paratroopers began landing {{around and}} {{to the west of}} the airfield on 20 May, Andrew became cut off from several of his platoons and companies with some being overrun by the German forces. Unable to gauge how the situation was unfolding, his communications with <b>Hargest</b> back at brigade headquarters also became disjointed. Andrew stressed the seriousness of the situation to <b>Hargest</b> and requested reinforcements from the other battalions, which were more than holding their own. <b>Hargest</b> incorrectly advised that there were no available troops. This left Andrew with his own small platoon-size reserve, which was used in a failed counter-attack. Eventually, Andrew sought permission to withdraw from Point 107; <b>Hargest</b> replied [...] "Well, if you must, you must." [...] Although well aware of the importance of Maleme Airfield to the defence of Crete, <b>Hargest</b> made no effort to dissuade Andrew or see the situation for himself. Despite the belated arrival of a reinforcing company of infantry sent by <b>Hargest</b> that evening, Andrew decided his position was not defensible in daylight and withdrew his units to join the other battalions of the brigade. The Germans took both the airfield and Point 107 early on the morning of 21 May. The capture of the airfield allowed German reinforcements to be landed directly on Crete and establish a strong foothold on their otherwise tenuous positions.|$|R
