5|$|Hominid {{is a short}} novel which {{contains}} one single and linear storyline. However, it is subdivided into seven chapters, each standing for a narrated day.

5|$|P. gobiensis {{is named}} for the region it was found in 2001, and first {{described}} by Sereno, Zhao and Lin in 2010. It is known from a skull and partial articulated skeleton with gastroliths. Many other specimens either cannot be determined to belong to any particular species, or <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> assigned to one. These specimens are generally all referred to as Psittacosaurus sp., {{although it is not}} assumed that they belong to the same species. More than 200 specimens of Psittacosaurus have been found in the Yixian Formation, which is famous for its fossils of feathered dinosaurs. The vast majority of these have not been assigned to any published species, although many are very well preserved and some have already been partially described. Nearly 100 Psittacosaurus skeletons were excavated in Mongolia during the summers of 2005 and 2006 by a team led by Mongolian paleontologist Bolortsetseg Minjin and American Jack Horner from the Museum of the Rockies in Montana. Although only P. mongoliensis has been described from Mongolia so far, these specimens are still in preparation and <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> assigned to a species.|$|E

5|$|After {{repeated}} positives {{over the}} summer, including tests from Leonardo Piepoli and Bernhard Kohl at the Tour de France, and Davide Rebellin and Stefan Schumacher from the 2008 Olympic Games, the UCI {{has sought to}} have samples taken during the Giro retested. In October 2009, {{it was announced that}} six to seven riders from this Giro had presumptive positives, while further untestable doping involving ozone was also suspected. In total, 82 samples were retested, and the presumptive positives have been compared to values stored at an anti-doping lab in Lausanne, Switzerland. The identities of those riders who tested positive <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> revealed. It is believed that Rebellin and Sella are among the riders to have presumptive positives.|$|E
5|$|Mercury (0.4AU {{from the}} Sun) {{is the closest}} planet to the Sun and the {{smallest}} planet in the Solar System (0.055 Earth masses). Mercury has no natural satellites; besides impact craters, its only known geological features are lobed ridges or rupes that were probably produced by a period of contraction early in its history. Mercury's very tenuous atmosphere consists of atoms blasted off its surface by the solar wind. Its relatively large iron core and thin mantle <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>yet</b> <b>been</b> adequately explained. Hypotheses include that its outer layers were stripped off by a giant impact; or, that it was prevented from fully accreting by the young Sun's energy.|$|E
