Under the peculiar risk doctrine, a person who hires an independent contractor to perform work that is <b>inherently</b> <b>dangerous</b> can be held liable for tort damages when the contractor’s negligent performance of the work causes injuries to others” (see Andreini case). There need not be any fault found {{on the part of the}} person who hires the independent contractor.|$|R
