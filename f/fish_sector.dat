Empirical implementation through econometric estimation is outlined, based on the normalized quadratic profit function for supply, multi-stage budgeting and the quadratic LA-AIDS for demand, and modified Armington aggregation for foreign trade. The model structure and equations (in general form) for computing equilibrium and generating market projections on supply, demand, price, and foreign trade are stated and explained...|$|E

40|$|The {{supplies}} {{of fish in}} the world’s vast oceans once seemed inexhaustible. Not any more. In the past three decades, production and consumption of fish have risen so dramatically that the world’s wild fisheries may fall victim to their own success. Meanwhile, the growing aquaculture industry has attempted {{to fill the gap}} between supply and demand. But as the global appetite for fish continues to increase, current trends in the <b>fish</b> <b>sector</b> pose serious risks to the environment, to the well-being of poor people, and to the viability of the <b>fish</b> <b>sector</b> itself. What is the outlook for fish in a globalizing food economy, and how will trends in the <b>fish</b> <b>sector</b> affect the poor and the environment during the next two decades? A new book from IFPRI and the WorldFish Center, Fish to 2020 : Supply and Demand in Changing Global Markets, and an accompanying food policy report, Outlook for Fish to 2020 : Meeting Global Demand, examine changes in the fish sector; the forces driving these changes; and the implications of the changes for fish consumption, production, prices, trade, the environment, and the world’s poor...|$|E

These steps are: (i) development of a <b>fish</b> <b>sector</b> model for each country, (ii) construction of ex ante impact indicators of improved carp strains, and (iii) analysis of the overall potential impact of culturing the genetically improved carp strains by incorporating the technology scenarios into the <b>fish</b> <b>sector</b> model.

40|$|Increasing {{consumer}} {{requirements for}} quality, safety and environmental sustainability of seafood products {{are recognized as}} the driving forces of vertical cooperation in the <b>fish</b> <b>sector.</b> Cooperation among the participants of the fish chain becomes apparent in formation of so-called supply chain networks that embody multilateral coordination and address {{more than just the}} goals of individual organizations. This requires that supply chain networks are successfully managed. Yet, it is not clear up to now what the success of supply chain networks is and how it can be measured. Therefore, this study aims to develop and test the model of the supply chain network success. We test the model empirically using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling based on the survey of 90 leading specialized fish retailers in Germany. We discuss our results and derive implications for fish chain management.

40|$|This {{paper is}} to {{investigate}} how climate change affect fisheries resources and economic performance of <b>fishing</b> <b>sector</b> and coastal communities in the Arctic {{with a focus on}} Svalbard Fisheries Protection Zone. Climate change is projected to alter the productivity of our oceans, the distribution, abundance, composition, quality and quantity of marine fisheries resources. Many coastal communities in the Arctic have been intricately connected to marine fisheries economically, culturally and socially. Changes in the spatial distribution and relative abundance of commercially exploited and potentially valuable fish species are likely to change the dynamics of fishing activities and exploitation patterns. Using a Dynamic Bioclimate Envelope Model (DBEM), we project that a warming climate will likely increase overall species richness and abundance in the Arctic, resulting in increased catch potential. We then evaluate how these changes affect <b>fishing</b> <b>sector</b> and coastal communities through changes in revenues, profits, fishing cost, household income and employment opportunities in the fisheries sector. The results highlight the disparity in climate vulnerability in fisheries related food security and livelihood between different <b>fishing</b> <b>sectors</b> and areas...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn Athens since 2011, {{austerity}} {{policies have}} been accompanied by political violence from the extreme-right and the police. Immigrants are among the main targets, especially as very strict European border control policies have turned Greece into a gateway for migrants, both legal and illegal, and have strengthened national xenophobic policies founded in an essentialist conception of identity. Constituting " migrants " as a national problem also reflects the Greek state's authoritarian legacy. This article explores these phenomena through a socio-spatial lens, focusing on Keratsini, a working-class neighborhood in the western suburbs of Athens. Its particular political and migration history influences the mix of competition and violence in the relations between its Greek residents and immigrants – many of them Egyptians working in the <b>fish</b> <b>sector</b> – but also the existence of solidarity {{in response to the}} state's authoritarian practices and economic austerity...|$|E

The first one deals with {{the evaluation of the}} effects of natural antioxidants (ellagic acid and L-ascorbic acid) in enhancing fresh sole (Solea solea) shelf life. Quality assurance in the <b>fish</b> <b>sector</b> involves monitoring and documenting defined quality criteria as required by regulations (European Community, 1996), product specifications and consumer demands. Fresh fish products are commonly sold at storage temperature. However, many undesirable changes can occur in the products during storage, due to microbial growth and fish spoilage, affording evident economic loss. From this point of view it is important to develop systems which help to prolong fish shelf life. In this perspective, we have studied the effects of ellagic acid (EA) and L-ascorbic acid (LAA) / sodium ascorbate (SA), either alone or in combination, on the microbiological quality of fresh finfish Solea solea during storage at 0 °C.
