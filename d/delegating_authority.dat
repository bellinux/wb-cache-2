50|$|The public {{counterparts}} (delegating authorities) of {{the concessions}} in Morocco are the municipalities. Each <b>delegating</b> <b>authority</b> {{has set up}} a technical committee to regulate the contracts, comprising representatives of the municipality, the Ministry of Interior and the concessionnaire. The committee reviews work plans and reports. In addition, about one year after the contracts in Casablanca and Rabat were signed local supervisory commissions were set up. Also, a supervisory commission was created at the national level. As of 2002, the government concluded that the members representing the <b>delegating</b> <b>authority</b> in the technical committee in Casablanca felt constrained by a lack of expertise compared to the specialists from the private concessionnaire. On the other hand, the concessionnaire felt that there was interference in the management of the services. This improved somewhat after the local supervisory commission was set up in Casablanca. This experience influenced the design of the concession contracts in Tangiers and Tetouan where clauses to protect consumers were added and local supervisory commissions were included in contract design from the beginning.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper offers}} an {{empirical}} test of complementarities among <b>delegated</b> <b>authority,</b> accountability, and monitoring, using unique survey {{data collected from}} group　affiliated companies in Japan. The survey provides information about how various decisions are made within business groups, each of which consists of a large core parent firm and its network of affiliated firms such as subsidiaries and related companies. We find some evidence that <b>delegated</b> <b>authority</b> and accountability are complementary, implying that increasing assigned accountability raises the marginal return from increasing <b>delegated</b> <b>authority.</b> We also obtain a stronger result that performance {{is likely to be}} better under the combination of low authority and low accountability or that of high authority and high accountability than under the “mix and match” combinations where one is low and the other high. We then study the effects of monitoring intensity on the authority-accountability pair and find that performance of the firm with the combination of high authority and high accountability is increasing in monitoring intensity, while the combination of low authority and low accountability is not. This result is consistent with the theoretical hypothesis that increasing monitoring intensity raises the marginal return from increasing <b>delegated</b> <b>authority</b> and accountability...|$|R
