25|$|In 1985, the Bank of Mauritius {{issued a}} {{completely}} new set of banknotes of 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, 500 and 1000 rupees. A close study of these banknotes reveals an interesting array of subsets which were printed by two banknote printing companies (Bradbury Wilkinson and Thomas de La Rue). The notes were also designed at different time periods as {{there are very few}} identical and consistent design features appearing on all the denominations. Varying banknote numbering systems, different types of security threads, variations in the design and size of the Mauritian Coat of Arms, different ultraviolet light latent printing, inconsistent variations in the size incrementation between the denominations and multiple different typesets are <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> differences. This issue lasted up to 1998.|$|E
25|$|There are {{thousands}} of different constructions that find a special point associated with (and often inside) a triangle, satisfying some unique property: see the article Encyclopedia of Triangle Centers for a catalogue of them. Often they are constructed by finding three lines associated in a symmetrical way with the three sides (or vertices) and then proving that the three lines meet in a single point: an important tool for proving {{the existence of these}} is Ceva's theorem, which gives a criterion for determining when three such lines are concurrent. Similarly, lines associated with a triangle are often constructed by proving that three symmetrically constructed points are : here Menelaus' theorem gives a useful general criterion. In this section <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> most commonly encountered constructions are explained.|$|E
