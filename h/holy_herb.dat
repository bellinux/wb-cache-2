Fangshi courtiers convinced Qin and Han emperors, most notably Qin Shi Huang (r. 221–210 BCE) and Emperor Wu of Han (r. 141–87 BCE), to dispatch large expeditions (e.g., Xu Fu in 219 BCE) seeking the zhi Plant of Immortality, but none produced tangible results.

During the blessing priests say a prayer that infuses the herbs with the power of protecting from evil. They are also used for incensing - a person thus cleansed may participate in the sacraments of Reconciliation and <b>Holy</b> Communion.

50|$|One of Monardes’ most {{well-known}} characteristics was his {{affinity for the}} tobacco plant. His fascination with the herb led him {{to believe that the}} crop had an incredible array of antidotal abilities. Monardes is known to assert that usage can cure over twenty conditions such as the common cold and, ironically, cancer. Tobacco went on to be used medicinally in Europe for some time. Many European doctors claimed the herb was essential for cures and for overall health and wellness. A devotee of Monardes’, Juan de Cardenas, echoed this sentiment by stating, “To seek to tell the virtues and greatness of this <b>holy</b> <b>herb,</b> the ailments which can be cured by it, and have been, the evils from which it has saved thousands would be to go on to infinity...this precious herb is so general a human need not only for the sick but for the healthy.” With many long-term users of the herb eventually showing degradation of health, tobacco’s harmful effects were recognized and discontinued as a mainstream European medicine.|$|E
50|$|In Homer's Odyssey, Circe is {{described}} as living in a mansion that {{stands in the middle}} of a clearing in a dense wood. Around the house prowled strangely docile lions and wolves, the drugged victims of her sorcery; they were not dangerous, and fawned on all newcomers. Circe worked at a huge loom. She invited Odysseus' crew to a feast of familiar food, a pottage of cheese and meal, sweetened with honey and laced with wine, but also laced with one of her magical potions and drunk from an enchanted cup. Thus so she turned them all into swine with her magic wand or staff after they gorged themselves on it. Only drunken Eurylochus, suspecting treachery from the outset, escaped to warn Odysseus and the others who had stayed behind at the ship. Odysseus set out to rescue his men, but was intercepted by the messenger god, Hermes, who had been sent by Athena. Hermes told Odysseus to use the <b>holy</b> <b>herb</b> moly to protect himself from Circe's wizardry and, having resisted it, to draw his sword and act as if he were going to attack her. From there, Circe would ask him to bed, but Hermes advised caution, for even there the goddess would be treacherous. She would take his manhood unless he had her swear by the names of the gods that she would not.|$|E

It is better to a sick man than meat, for a sick man will sooner eat pottage than meat. Pottage will digest with him when meat will not: pottage will nourish the blood, fill the veins, run into every part of a man, make him warmer; so will these prayers do, set our soul and body in a heat, warm our devotion, work fervency in us, lift up our soul to God. For there be herbs of God's own planting in our pottage as ye call it--the Ten Commandments, dainty herbs to season any pottage in the world; there is the Lord's Prayer, {{and that is a}} most sweet pot-herb, cannot be denied; then there is also David's herbs, his prayers and psalms, helps to make our pottage relish well; the psalm of the blessed Virgin, a good pot-herb. Though they be, as some term them, cock-crowed pottage, yet they are as sweet, as good, as dainty, and as fresh, as they were at first. The sun hath not made them sour with its heat, neither hath the cold water taken away their vigour and strength. Compare them with the Scriptures, and see if they be not as well seasoned and crumbed. If you find any thing in them that is either too salt, too fresh, or too bitter, that herb shall be taken out and better put in, if it can be got, or none. And as in kitchen pottage there are many good herbs, so there is likewise in this church pottage, as ye call it. For first, there is in kitchen pottage good water to make them so; on the contrary, in the other pottage there is the water of life. 2. There is salt, to season them; so in the other is a prayer of grace to season their hearts. 3. There is oatmeal to nourish the body, in the other is the bread of life. 4. There is thyme in them to relish them, and it is very wholesome--in the other is the wholesome exhortation not to harden our heart while it is called to-day. This relisheth well. 5. There is a small onion to give a taste--in the other is a good herb, called Lord have mercy on us. These, and many other <b>holy</b> <b>herbs</b> are contained in it, all boiling in the heart of man, will make as good pottage as the world can afford, especially if you use these herbs for digestion. The herb repentance, the herb grace, the herb faith, the herb love, the herb hope, the herb good works, the herb feeling, the herb zeal, the herb fervency, the herb ardency, the herb constancy, with many more of this nature, most excellent for digestion."

Diabetes milletus is one such disease, which is causing serious {{problems}} to human health {{in all parts of the}} world. Diabetes Mellitus is a metabolic disorder characterized by high blood glucose levels due to defect in insulin secretion, insulin action or both. Poor control of the condition can result in long term complication such as diabetic nephropathy, neuropathy, retinopathy, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and cardiovascular disease, which can lead to a heart attack or stroke. Scientific reports revealed that diabetes cannot be cured completely. Current therapy for diabetes is centred around controlling blood sugar levels to keep them in the normal range. However, diabetes is often associated with dyslipidaemia and oxidative stress, which contributes to the damage caused to organs. Therefore, to adequately control diabetes, blood lipid levels and oxidative stress need to be controlled alongside blood glucose. The modern systems of medicine have not shown any significant effect for the treatment of the disease. There are also concerns about the cost and safety in long-term use for some of these 5 th Annual International Conference on Health & Medical Sciences, 1 - 4 May 2017, Athens, Greece: Abstract Book 136 drugs. Hence focus has been turned towards traditional system of medicine. Medicinal plants play an important role in management of diabetes milletus. During the past few years many bioactive drugs have been isolated from plants. Herbal medicines have shown good clinical practice in the therapy of diabetic milletus. The genus Ocimum is of the basil family Lamiaceae, which contains approximately 150 species of aromatic plants that are found mainly in the tropical regions of the world. Many of these species have extensive medicinal applications in indigenous medicinal systems of countries in Asia, Africa and South America. Lamiaceae is one of the <b>holiest</b> and sacred <b>herbs</b> grown in India. This plant is known to possess antiseptic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, antistress, Immunomodulatory, hypoglycaemic, hypotensive and antioxidant properties. Among these species are Ocimum sanctum L. or Ocimum tenuiflorum L., also known as Tulsi or Holybasil, an aromatic plant. There are two sub- types of Ocimum sanctum called Krishna tulsi which is the black-purple variety, and the white Vana tulsi. It is widely used in Ayurveda and Siddha system of medicine to cure various ailments. The dried powder of Tulsi was placed in the thimble of Soxhlet apparatus, distilled water employed as a solvent.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{is part of}} a series on Methodology and Biblical Spirituality. In this, the fourth contribution, the scope is widened; more practical-analytically oriented, three thoroughly different but nevertheless all unusual kinds of interpretations of the Bible are described, characterised and contextualised. Namely: •	 In order to explain what are perceived as textual anomalies, some Old Testament authors have been described by US-based medical practitioners as having suffered psychiatric dysfunctions. •	 The Garden of Eden from Genesis 2 and further has been located by a recently diseased Nigerian scholar as having been in her home country, with a Nigerian race having been the predecessors of biblical Adam and Eve. •	 Rastafarians, primarily Jamaica-based, regard marijuana as a <b>holy</b> <b>herb</b> and find direct support for their religious use of this plant in the Bible. However strange such ‘mystifying’ interpretations may seem within the theological mainstreams of Judeo-Christianity, there is more to these kinds of interpretations than simple whim. Certain cultural conditions along with personal, particularly spiritual, commitments enable these interpretations, which must be taken seriously in order to come to a fuller understanding of the text–interpreter dynamic. These then can cast at least some form of reflective light on the more usual current biblical-interpretative mainstreams within Judeo-Christianity, posing in a new light the question of what constitutes legitimate interpretations, also within mainstream interpretations, as religiously inclined people try to live their lives in the light of Scripture. </p...|$|E
