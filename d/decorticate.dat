The rupture of these vessels leads to linear or flamed shaped hemorrhages. The disrupted brainstem can lead to <b>decorticate</b> posture, respiratory center depression and death.

The Chinese also innovated the square-pallet chain pump by the 1st century AD, powered by a waterwheel or an oxen pulling on a system of mechanical wheels. Although the chain pump found use in public works of providing water for urban and palatial pipe systems, it was used largely to lift water from a lower to higher elevation in filling irrigation canals and channels for farmland.|$|E

By the end of the Han dynasty in the late 2nd century, heavy ploughs had been developed with iron ploughshares and mouldboards. These would slowly spread west, revolutionizing farming in Northern Europe by the 10th century. (Glick, however, argues for a development of the Chinese plough as late as the 9th century, implying its spread east from similar designs known in Italy by the 7th century.) ...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{evaluate the}} role of the neocortex in rodent spatial learning. In Experiment 1, perinatally <b>decorticated</b> rats and sham-operated controls began ten training sessions at day 200 on an 8 -arm radial maze. <b>Decorticated</b> rats made more errors than controls, but showed improvement by the tenth session. In the second experiment, training was extended to determine whether <b>decorticates</b> could eventually match control performance levels if given sufficient training. Spontaneous activity levels were also recorded and compared to maze performance to investigate the relationship between poor performance on the radial maze and activity. More than half of the <b>decorticates</b> reached criterion performance. <b>Decorticates</b> had significantly elevated spontaneous activity levels when compared to controls, and the magnitude of this hyperactivity was related to performance deficits on the radial maze. These results suggest that with extended training <b>decorticates</b> can learn a spatial task. Performance deficits may reflect the hyperactive tendency of <b>decorticates</b> rather than a specific impairment of spatial learning abilities...|$|R

After Huan Tan's book was written, numerous references to trip hammers powered by waterwheels were made in subsequent Chinese dynasties and in Medieval Europe by the 12th century. However, trip hammers were also attested by both literary (Pliny, Natural History 18.97) and archaeological evidence in fairly widespread use in the Roman Empire by the 1st century AD.|$|E

The author made studies on its effects on leukocyte count and body temperature in <b>decorticated</b> animals. The results are summarized as follows : (1) The administration of chlorpromazine to normal animals resulted in a decrease in leukocyte count and a fall in body temperature. This action of chlorpromazine was potentized when phenobarbital was administered in combination with chlorpromazine. (2) The state of violent sham rage was induced,in. rabbits in a few hours following decortication, with the result that the <b>decorticated</b> rabbits could not survive long. The administration of chlorpromazine relieved this state. (3) Leukocyte count and body temperature of rabbits have remained normal even after they were <b>decorticated.</b> (4) Studies have been performed on <b>decorticated</b> cats {{over a long period of}} time. The state of sham rage was induced by the administration of physiologic saline 3 to 7 hours after decortication. An increase in leukocyte count occurred simultaneously.

The nitrogen-corrected metabolizable energy content of the <b>decorticated</b> safflower meal by the total collection method on a dry basis was 1. 75 kcal. / gm., and by the fiber tracer technique 1. 63 kcal. /gm. The average of these two values was 1. 69 kcal. /gm.

50|$|Assessment of {{posture and}} body habitus {{is the next}} step. It {{involves}} general observation about the patient's positioning. There are often two stereotypical postures seen in comatose patients. <b>Decorticate</b> posturing is a stereotypical posturing in which the patient has arms flexed at the elbow, and arms adducted toward the body, with both legs extended. Decerebrate posturing is a stereotypical posturing in which the legs are similarly extended (stretched), but the arms are also stretched (extended at the elbow). The posturing is critical since it indicates where the damage is in the central nervous system. A <b>decorticate</b> posturing indicates a lesion (a point of damage) {{at or above the}} red nucleus, whereas a decerebrate posturing indicates a lesion at or below the red nucleus. In other words, a <b>decorticate</b> lesion is closer to the cortex, as opposed to a decerebrate cortex that is closer to the brainstem.|$|E
