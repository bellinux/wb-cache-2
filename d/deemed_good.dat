At the season's end, {{he was named}} the Supporters' Player of the Year, the chairman's Player of the Year and the Manager's Player of the Year. He helped Eastwood to a play-off position in 2010–11 with a fifth-place finish, although {{they were unable to}} play in them as their ground was not <b>deemed</b> <b>good</b> enough for the Conference Premier. He made 46 appearances and scored 11 goals in 2010–11.|$|E

25|$|In {{the months}} leading up to the races, there are two series of races, the Thameside Series and Waterside Series, that are <b>deemed</b> <b>good</b> {{practice}} for crews competing in the main Devizes to Westminster race. The Thameside Series is based around Reading, with two races, going from Aldermaston to Reading and Reading to Marlow respectively. The Waterside Series is a series of four races based around Newbury, Berkshire, of lengths 14 miles, 17.5 miles, 23 miles and 34 miles - it is often competed as a series on its own.|$|E
25|$|For four years, the Institute for Technological Research (IPT) of the University of São Paulo {{conducted}} {{a series of}} studies of those waters. Generally, water from great depths has a high concentration of substances that may be harmful to human beings, and its pH may not be suitable for bathing. In 1940 the results were published in Bulletin 26 of the IPT. The waters were <b>deemed</b> <b>good</b> for bathing, and their medicinal properties were studied by Professor João de Aguiar Pupo, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine of São Paulo.|$|E
25|$|Wine {{produced}} in the Cote de Nuits can fall under several Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée (AOC) depending on where the grapes were grown and whether they were blended with grapes from other areas. All wines {{produced in}} the Cote de Nuits is entitled to the basic AOC Bourgogne designation for either its blanc Chardonnay wines or it rouge pinot noir. A higher quality AOC is the Côte de Nuits Villages, a general appellation for wines from five of the smaller communes : Fixin and Brochon in the north, Comblanchien, Corgoloin and Prissey to the south. The Hautes-Côtes de Nuits are a separate appellation for the hills {{to the west of}} Nuits-St-Georges. Individual 'village' appellations are the next step up, although not all match the commune boundaries or names. Notably in the north the Marsannay appellation covers Marsannay-la-Côte and parts of Couchey and Chênove. The Premiers Crus are the next level and roughly correspond to individual vineyards that weren't <b>deemed</b> <b>good</b> enough for Grand Cru status.|$|E

25|$|Following his graduation, Chikatilo {{applied for}} a {{scholarship}} at Moscow State University. Although he passed the entrance examination with good-to-excellent scores, his grades were not <b>deemed</b> <b>good</b> enough for acceptance. Chikatilo speculated his scholarship application was rejected due to his father's tainted war record (his father had been branded a traitor for being taken prisoner in 1943), {{but the truth was}} that other students had performed better in a highly competitive exam. He did not attempt to enroll at another university; instead, he travelled to the city of Kursk, where he worked as a labourer for three months before—in 1955—enrolling in a vocational school, where he studied to become a communications technician. The same year, Chikatilo formed his first serious relationship, with a local girl two years his junior. On three separate occasions, the couple attempted intercourse, although on each occasion, Chikatilo was unable to sustain an erection. After 18 months, the girl broke off their relationship.|$|E
25|$|Green took a {{managerial}} {{interest in}} Boilerhouse but Stevens and Terrey {{were not prepared}} to turn professional at the time, so Green put an advert in the Melody Maker to find another rhythm section to back Kirwan. Over 300 applicants replied but after several auditions, none was <b>deemed</b> <b>good</b> enough to replace the pair by the hard to please Green, so another solution was found. Fleetwood Mac had been constituted as a quartet, but Green {{had been looking for}} another guitarist to share some of the workload, in view of slide guitarist Jeremy Spencer's unwillingness to contribute much to Green's songs. Drummer Mick Fleetwood, previously a member of John Mayall & the Bluesbreakers, suggested to Green that Kirwan could join Fleetwood Mac, and although neither Green, bassist John McVie (both also former Bluesbreakers), nor Spencer were entirely convinced, Fleetwood asked Kirwan to join the band in August 1968. Kirwan's arrival expanded Fleetwood Mac to a five-piece with three guitarists. He played his first gig with the band on 14 August at the Nag's Head Blue Horizon Club in Battersea, London.|$|E
25|$|Bushby {{made his}} {{first-class}} debut for Sussex against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord's in 1843, with him making five further first-class appearances {{for the county}} in that year. He made several further first-class appearances the following year and was <b>deemed</b> <b>good</b> enough {{to play for the}} Players in the Gentlemen v Players fixture at Lord's. He also played two first-class fixtures for Petworth Cricket Club against the Marylebone Cricket Club in 1844, as well as playing a first-class match each for a team of Single men against a team of Married men and for England against Kent. He made several further appearances in 1845 for Sussex, Petworth, England and the Players, making ten appearances in first-class cricket. The start of the following season saw Bushby selected to play for Fuller Pilch's personal eleven against the personal eleven of Nicholas Felix, {{for the remainder of the}} season he made five further appearances in first-class matches for Sussex, while the following year he made just three appearances for the county. He made no appearances in first-class cricket in 1848, but did return to play in seven matches for Sussex in 1849, before making a further five appearances in 1850. Of his three first-class appearances in 1851, one included appearing for the South in the North v South fixture. In 1852, he appeared in five first-class matches for Sussex and the following year he made four further appearances for it. He also played in 1853 for a combined Kent and Sussex team against an All England Eleven. 1854 was to be his final season in first-class cricket, with Bushby making five appearances for Sussex and a single appearance for the South against the North. In total he made 64 recorded appearances in first-class matches, the majority of which were for Sussex. His 50 appearances for the county saw him score 1,103 runs at an average of 13.78, with three half centuries and a high score of 86.|$|E
5000|$|In social psychology, a {{significant}} {{other is a}} parent, uncle/aunt, grandparent, guardian or teacher — the person who guides and takes care of a child during primary socialization. The significant other protects, rewards, and punishes the child {{as a way of}} aiding the child's development. This usually takes about six or seven years, after which the significant other is no longer needed, and the child moves on to a general [...] "other" [...] which is not a real person, but an abstract notion of what society <b>deems</b> <b>good</b> or bad.|$|R

500|$|After basic {{training}} in the Army, he was discharged from his barracks in Dresden in October 1934. In February 1935 Galland was now part of 900 airmen waiting to be inducted to the new ReichsLuftwaffe. In March Galland was ordered to report to Jagdgeschwader 2 (Fighter Wing 2), arriving at its headquarters in Jüterbog-Damm on 1 April 1935. [...] Galland's performance {{had not yet been}} impressive enough for a position as an instructor, so he was evaluated and <b>deemed</b> <b>good</b> enough for an operational posting.|$|E
500|$|According to the singer, {{the clip}} portrays [...] "a {{day in the}} life of the earth to show that we are rushing forward to the end of the 1900s century at full speed. I think Jonas made an {{excellent}} interpretation of the song, although he forced me to dance like crazy for two days. He's a tough director". Inspiration came from the 1982 American experimental film, Koyaanisqatsi, which showed time-lapse footage of cities. Madonna's scenes were shot in early April 1998 at MTV's Times Square studios in New York and Los Angeles. Background scenes were shot in various cities such as Los Angeles, New York, London, Las Vegas, and Stockholm. Test shots taken in Stockholm were presented to Madonna, for conveying the idea behind the clip, but they were <b>deemed</b> <b>good</b> to be used in the final product.|$|E
2500|$|Professor Robert A. Oden, {{formerly}} of Dartmouth College, {{argued that the}} reason for the Priestly laws of kashrut in [...] was the integrity of creation and what the world's created order looked like.

5000|$|Istislah bears some {{similarities}} {{to the natural}} law tradition in the West, as exemplified by Thomas Aquinas. However, whereas natural law <b>deems</b> <b>good</b> that which is known self-evidently to be good, according as it tends towards the fulfilment of the person, istislah calls good whatever is connected to one of five [...] "basic goods". Al-Ghazali abstracted these [...] "basic goods" [...] from the five legal precepts in the Quran and Sunnah—religion, life, reason, lineage (or offspring), and property. In this classical formulation, istislah differs from utilitarianism—"the greatest happiness for {{the greatest number of}} people"—because something that results in [...] "the greatest happiness" [...] may infringe any one of the five basic values.|$|R
5000|$|Bloomfield {{had been}} {{inspired}} by a track by Colourbox called [...] "The Official Colourbox World Cup theme and he had noticed that the respected BBC Radio DJ John Peel occasionally played tracks by American football teams <b>deeming</b> them <b>good</b> enough to play on his show {{without a hint of}} irony.|$|R

2500|$|In 1789, Leicester played Nottingham {{again in}} two matches at Loughborough. They won one each and full {{scorecards}} have survived. [...] It {{is evident that}} by this time these teams were representative of their counties and, in 1791, they were both <b>deemed</b> <b>good</b> enough to play against MCC, but they were both well beaten. This was hardly surprising as northern cricket was still developing while the southern teams had considerable match experience.|$|E
2500|$|Media {{observers}} were also {{critical of the}} controversial replay review. Chris Chase of USA Today wrote that [...] "three highly trained officials, <b>deemed</b> <b>good</b> enough to be reffing in the biggest game of the year, disagreed with all three CBS analysts, all of Twitter and every American watching". Sam Cooper of Yahoo! Sports was perplexed by the officials explanation of the call that [...] "they just couldn't see anything." [...] NCAA's head of officiating, John Adams, later stated that the officials never saw the conclusive angle and got the call wrong as a result.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{people wonder}} where the Xs came from, and {{how were they}} ever used on beer. [...] In truth, the three Xs are {{actually}} a quality rating system. [...] The system was initially used in Europe during the 16th Century. [...] As European royalty traveled their lands and visited neighboring counties, a royal courier was sent ahead of the official party. [...] The courier’s job was to sample beer at inns along the way. [...] If the beer was only average, the courier would mark the inn’s sign or door with a single X. [...] If the inn’s beer was <b>deemed</b> <b>good,</b> the sign or door would receive two Xs. [...] A mark on an inn of three Xs meant that the beer inside was excellent, and a must-stop for the royal court as they passed through.|$|E
25|$|Siberia was <b>deemed</b> a <b>good</b> {{place to}} exile for {{political}} reasons, {{as it was}} far from any foreign country. A St.Petersburg citizen would not wish to escape in vast Siberian countryside as the peasants and criminals did. Even the larger cities such as Irkutsk, Omsk, and Krasnoyarsk, lacked that intensive social life and luxurious high life of the capital.|$|R
50|$|Hangings {{during the}} colonial era of America were mostly {{performed}} publicly in order to deter the behavior for which the criminals were hanged.

2500|$|Albert Brisbane and Victor Prosper Considerant also {{visited the}} Church in Utah during its early years, {{prompting}} Considerant {{to note that}} [...] "thanks to a certain dose of socialist solidarity, the Mormons have {{in a few years}} attained a state of unbelievable prosperity". Attributing the peculiar socialist attitudes of the early Mormons with their success in the desert of the western United States was common even among those who were not themselves socialist. For instance, in his book History of Utah, 1540-1886, Hubert Howe Bancroft points out that the Mormons [...] "while not communists, the elements of socialism enter strongly into all their relations, public and private, social, commercial, and industrial, as well as religious and political. [...] This tends to render them exclusive, independent of the gentiles and their government, and even in some respects antagonistic to them. [...] They have assisted each other until nine out of ten own their farms, while commerce and manufacturing are to large extent cooperative. [...] The rights of property are respected; but while a Mormon may sell his farm to a gentile, it would not be <b>deemed</b> <b>good</b> fellowship for him to do so.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The four-cd box set {{compilation}} received {{critical acclaim}} upon its release. The Times wrote in its review of Downside Up: [...] "Standouts include the spiky Drop Dead/Celebration, the sinister Eve White/Eve Black and the chopped up industrial funk of Tattoo". The critic also rated the band {{as one of}} [...] "the most audacious and uncompromising musical adventurers of the post-punk era." [...] Stylus rated it A saying : [...] "It’s a wonderfully eclectic mixture of fingers-down-a-blackboard avant-punk (“Voices (On The Air),” “Eve White/Eve Black”), Creatures-esque tribal drum-worship (“Sunless”), majestic beauty (“Something Blue,” “Shooting Sun,” “Return”), amusing experimentation (“Slap Dash Snap,” “(There’s A) Planet In My Kitchen”), linguistic fun (“Mittageisen,” “Il Est Ne, Le Divin Enfant,” “El Dia De Los Muertos”) and, yes, playfully ‘dark’ tunes (“Something Wicked (This Way Comes),” “Are You Still Dying, Darling?”)." [...] Record Collector praised the box set for its [...] "remarkable diversity, spontaneity and playfulness", considering that there are [...] "No throwaway tracks". Critic Murray Chalmers noted: [...] ""Drop Dead/Celebration" [...] is still a wonderful explosion of bile aimed at their absconded guitarist and drummer, while Slap Dash Snap is prototype techno." [...] She underlined {{the diversity of the}} material: [...] "on more reflective tracks like Sea Of Light and Let Go you feel that here is a group who could go anywhere". She then stated: [...] "By CD2 they are firing on all cylinders, a pop group thrillingly ahead of the pack, CD3 is immaculate." [...] and considered the four tracks of The Thorn that end the box set as an [...] "orchestrated EP of ferocious intensity". Rock Sound shared a similar point of view and said: [...] "Whilst most bands regard the B-side as an irrelevancy, a dumping ground for throwaway tracks not <b>deemed</b> <b>good</b> enough for proper release, Siouxsie And The Banshees always treated it with respect, an excuse to have fun and experiment." [...] Neil Gardner praised [...] "the sensual menace of [...] "Tattoo"". Uncut qualified Downside Up as [...] "an exhaustive and fascinating collection from an astonishing group".|$|E
