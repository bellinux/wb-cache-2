500|$|After {{recording}} {{was completed}} Kannberg was tasked with releasing the music himself, as Malkmus {{had left on}} a trip to parts of Europe, North Africa, and the Middle East. Kannberg designed the cover of the EP and sent copies to various independent labels, distributors, and zines. He recalled [...] "I {{had no idea how to}} do it. I'd send off these little notes to my favorite labels like SST and Twin Tone and ask, 'How do I do this?'" [...] A representative from SST recommended that Kannberg use Erica Records, a Los Angeles 7" [...] manufacturer. Erica Records became the manufacturer of Slay Tracks; however, Kannberg was unhappy with the master recording produced by the company: [...] "It sounds like it sounds now—it's just a mess—but being poor and not really caring I said, 'Okay, that's cool, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> like that–whatever.'" [...] 1000 copies of Slay Tracks were pressed, and the first 50 included a green dinosaur stamp on the label. The EP was distributed on Kannberg's own Treble Kicker Records in the United States and England, although Malkmus came across a copy in a record store while visiting Austria.|$|E
500|$|... "Billie Jean" [...] was {{recorded}} by American rock musician Chris Cornell for his Carry On album in 2007. Cornell {{said of his}} cover, [...] "I didn't plan on it. It just sort of happened organically. I changed the music quite a bit, I didn't touch the lyrics." [...] He added, [...] "And it's not a joke. I took a completely different approach to it, musically." [...] Cornell had previously performed the song live in Europe, including an acoustic set in Stockholm, Sweden in September 2006. He later said, [...] "I {{was getting ready to}} do some acoustic shows on a promotional tour for Revelations and I just wanted to have fun with it." [...] The cover received favorable reviews from critics. MTV noted the [...] "bluesier, more pained and impassioned feel" [...] which stripped away [...] "any pop elements of the original". Los Angeles Times described the track as [...] "a grim, spooky take" [...] on Jackson's [...] "Billie Jean", and added that it was [...] "amusing enough, even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> a lot more like Metallica's 'Nothing Else Matters'". The newspaper concluded that [...] "Jacko's mega hit [...] the stunt translation". In 2008, Cornell's version was performed live by David Cook on the seventh season of American Idol, and this version charted on Billboard's Hot 100 at No. 47. In May of the same year, dance act Signature used [...] "Nachna Onda Nei" [...] on Britain's Got Talent in their audition and again in their final performance. In 2011, Patrick Stump covered the song in an a cappella mash-up tribute to Jackson along with several other songs over pre-recorded backing vocals.|$|E

60|$|Our Tobacco Parliament {{next set}} itself to {{consider}} by what means, if this happened, Canada could keep her identity unsubmerged; {{and that led}} {{to one of the}} most curious talks I have ever heard. It seemed to be decided that she might--just might--pull through by the skin of her teeth as a nation--if (but this was doubtful) England did not help others to hammer her. Now, twenty years ago one would not have heard any of this sort of thing. <b>If</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> a little mad, remember that the Mother Country was throughout considered as a lady in violent hysterics.|$|E
25|$|The {{names of}} {{the streets of the}} three towns I {{surveyed}} were taken from Bishoprics and the way it was done was this; as soon as I completed the map I took it to Thomas who putting on his gold spectacles and opening his would read out a Bishop's name to hear <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> well. <b>If</b> I agreed with him that it did, I put the name to one of the streets requiring baptism.|$|R

5000|$|... "There {{was a lot}} of that {{in those}} days" [...] Barry laughed, [...] "There {{was a lot of}} psychedelia and the idea that if you wrote something, even <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> ridiculous, {{somebody}} would find the meaning for it, and that was the truth". Robin Gibb told The Mail on Sunday on 1 November 2009 about [...] "I Started a Joke": [...] "This is a very spiritual song.

6000|$|... "Dear Rachael," [...] he said, [...] "you must {{remember}} that when I was alone in London waiting to hear from you, I naturally saw {{a good deal of}} Helga. She was kind to me, and she was the means by which your letters and messages reached me. I am afraid," [...] he continued, thoughtfully, [...] "that I was so happy, in those days, to have found anyone who was kind and talked decently to me, that I may have misled her. There has been a little trouble once or twice since. I have tried to be pleasant and friendly with her. She seems--forgive me <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> conceited--she seems to want more." ...|$|E

5000|$|Rick Anderson of AllMusic {{gave the}} album 4 stars out of 5, saying, [...] "This {{is one of}} those albums that reveals more with {{repeated}} listens; <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> too easy at first, listen again -- there's lots of interesting stuff going on beneath what sometimes sounds like a merely pleasant surface." ...|$|E

5000|$|Calvin was {{concerned}} to avoid further fragmentation, i.e. splits among the Evangelical churches: [...] "I am {{saying that we}} should not desert a church on account of some minor disagreement, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> upholds <b>sound</b> doctrine over the essentials of piety, and maintains the use of the sacraments established by the Lord." ...|$|R
5000|$|Answering the {{question}} about {{how and why the}} new album was different from her previous records, Danilova said: It was the longest I've had to record an album, which was three ... to five months. Which, to me, was way too much time {{and at the same time}} not enough. But I added acoustic elements, like live drums and strings which was very new to me. Plus I worked with a producer for the first time, mixing the record and producing it, which I had never done before. ... And just the way I wrote it was much different, because with everything I wrote, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> too much like something I'd written before like something I'm used to writing, I'd throw away the song and start over.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{press release}} for the album, however, guitarist and singer Colin Newman, drew a {{distinction}} between the material selected for WIRE and that for Nocturnal Koreans: “The WIRE album was quite respectful of the band, and Nocturnal Koreans is less respectful of the band—or, more accurately, it’s the band being less respectful to itself—in that it’s more created in the studio, rather than recorded basically as the band played it, which was mostly the case with WIRE. A general rule for this record was: any trickery is fair game, <b>if</b> <b>it</b> makes <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> better.” ...|$|R
5000|$|Naing said that, like jazz musicians, Burmese players [...] "look at {{one another}} {{and listen to the}} tune and play accordingly... even though they might play the same piece of music, the next time they play it differently."

5000|$|Commended {{by critics}} for his gritty realism and strong dialogue, Leonard {{sometimes}} took liberties with grammar {{in the interest}} of speeding the story along.

[...] He also hinted: [...] "I try to leave out the parts that readers tend to skip." ...|$|E
40|$|In {{contemporary}} {{philosophy of}} mind, {{the issue of}} consciousness has taken center stage. Broadly speaking, those who deal with consciousness fall into two camps: those who prioritize empirical work and those who favor conceptual investigation. One prominent argument has served to deepen the divide: the argument {{for the possibility of}} zombies. In this paper I intend to examine closely this argument, as it’s presented by David Chalmers, and some of the attempts to discredit it. In so doing, I present some of my own arguments against it, as well as the claim that <b>if</b> <b>it’s</b> <b>sound,</b> then materialism is false. Finally, I present a sketch of a new way of thinking about consciousness that would, I argue, guard against the threat—real or merely apparent—of arguments such as the zombie-argument...|$|R

On 23 October, having understood the baby would not survive, she asked for a termination, and was told it was not legally possible in Ireland while there is a foetal heartbeat.
