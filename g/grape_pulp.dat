5000|$|Shiraz is {{harvested}} from late February to early April. McLaren Vale Shiraz displays pronounced berry and spice characters with some dark chocolate and liquorice, while Shiraz from cooler sub-regions exhibits defined ripe raspberry characters. McLaren Vale Shiraz is {{renowned for its}} great softness and rolling palate. Many winemakers in McLaren Vale choose to blend their final Shiraz {{from a variety of}} sub-regions to add complexity. McLaren Vale naturally produces Shiraz that has very small berries. Smaller berries have a higher skin to pulp ratio. Berry skin contains flavanols (Anti-sunburn in grapes, 'flavour' in wine), Anthocyanins (colour) and other complex molecules that add to wine complexity. <b>Grape</b> <b>pulp</b> contains sugar and water. Therefore, the more skin to less pulp the more complex the finished wine. Small berries make more intense Shiraz wine.

40|$|Thaumatin-like {{proteins}} (TLPs) and chitinases are {{the main}} constituents of so-called protein hazes which can form in finished white wine and {{which is a great}} concern of winemakers. These soluble pathogenesis-related (PR) proteins are extracted from grape berries. However, their distribution in different grape tissues is not well documented. In this study, proteins were first separately extracted from the skin, pulp and seed of Sauvignon Blanc grapes, followed by trypsin digestion and analysis by liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS). Proteins identified included 75 proteins from Sauvignon Blanc grape skin, 63 from <b>grape</b> <b>pulp</b> and 35 from grape seed, mostly functionally classified as associated with metabolism and energy. Some were present exclusively in specific grape tissues; for example, proteins involved in photosynthesis were only detected in grape skin and proteins found in alcoholic fermentation were only detected in <b>grape</b> <b>pulp.</b> Moreover, proteins identified in grape seed were less diverse than those identified in grape skin and pulp. TLPs and chitinases were identified in both Sauvignon Blanc grape skin and pulp, but not in the seed. To relatively quantify the PR proteins, the protein extracts of grape tissues were seperated by HPLC first and then analysed by SDS-PAGE. The results showed that the protein fractions eluted at 9. 3 min and 19. 2 min under the chromatographic conditions of this study confirmed that these corresponded to TLPs and chitinases seperately. Thus, the relative quantification of TLPs and chitinases in protein extracts was carried out by comparing the area of corresponding peaks against the area of a thamautin standard. The results presented in this study clearly demonstrated the distribution of haze-forming PR proteins in grape berries, and the relative quantification of TLPs and chitinases could be applied in fast tracking of changes in PR proteins during grape growth and determination of PR proteins in berries at harvest...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{cell wall}} (CW) is the dynamic border of plant cells. In grape berries, the CW decisively {{accounts}} for {{the difference between the}} pulp and skin cells, with direct consequences on the grape characteristics, wine quality and wine-making methods. The softening of mature berries results from the depolymerisation and solubilisation of CW polymers. Modifications of <b>grape</b> <b>pulp</b> and skin CW provide the flexibility for cell expansion during fruit growth and to modulate the final texture. Wine making and berry processing methods are directly related with the absence, in white wines, or the presence, in red wines, of skin CW in the fermenting must. Anthocyanin extraction depends directly on skin yielding of the pigment upon CW degradation. During fruit growth and ripening, the cooperative action between different enzyme families is capital in CW metabolism. The sequencing and public availability of the Vitis genome allowed us to focus on individual pathways, to profile the expression pattern of isoforms associated with each tissue, developmental phase or stress response, anticipating the effects on berry (and wine) production and quality.

However, the result was opposite in the Borbon cultivar, with values of 141. 11 units/ 100 g in the pulp and 11. 50 units/ 100 g in the peel being found. The results of the polyphenoloxidase in the Borbon cultivar activity were 100. 18 units/ 100 g in the pulp and 102. 60 units/ 100 g in the peel, and in the Rubi and Benitaka cultivars were 60. 40 units/ 100 g, 48. 62 units/ 100 g in the pulp and 17. 40 units/ 100 g, and 26. 20 units/ 100 g in the peel, respectively. Protein determination {{was carried out in}} each extract, and the results found in the pulp and peel, respectively, were 0. 56 and 0. 64 mg/ 100 g for cultivar Benitaka, 1. 38 and 6. 45 mg/ 100 g for cultivar Rubi, and 21. 38 and 5. 68 mg/ 100 g for Borbon. The extracts were submitted to thermal treatments (60 °C, 65 °C, 70 °C and 75 °C for a 1 to 10 minutes period) to observe the behavior of the peroxidase and polyphenoloxidase enzymatic activity, being verified a continuous decrease of the peroxidase and polyphenoloxidase activities {{as a result of the}} thermal treatment. The extracts of the Rubi and Benitaka cultivars were more heat stable than the extract from the Borbon cultivar for both enzymes. However, the temperatures used were not enough for a total inactivation of the enzymes...|$|R
40|$|Grape {{cultivation}} {{dates back}} to approximately 6000 - 8000 years ago. Nowadays it {{is still one of}} the major crops produced worldwide, mostly for wine production. Accordingly, grape pomace, the solid remain of the wine making process, is produced in large quantities. The disposal of such waste material is an issue of great ecologic and economic importance. Some wineries use the material as a fertilizer, while others are selling it to biogas companies for energy production. However, grape pomace possesses a much higher potential. Pomace is composed of <b>grape</b> seeds, stems, <b>pulps</b> and skins and contains pharmaceutically interesting polyphenolic compounds such as catechin, epicatechin, trans-resveratrol and procyanidin B 1. Such compounds have beneficial effects on human health including antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, antidiabetic and anticarcinogenic activities. Such interesting compounds may be extracted from grape pomace by the use of organic solvents, however this procedure has several limitations, including solvent toxicity and the non-selectivity of the extraction towards lipophilic compounds. Alternative extraction technologies focus on the use of supercritical fluids. Supercritical CO 2 is the most commonly used solvent, since it is non-toxic, inert and has modest critical values in terms of temperature and pressure, making its use industrially appealing. By the use of supercritical fluids extraction, high-quality extracts can be obtained from a variety of raw materials, including grapes, grape seeds and grape pomace...|$|R
