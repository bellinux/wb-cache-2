5|$|Afterwards Draco {{uses his}} {{contacts}} to inform Bond that Blofeld is somewhere in Switzerland. Bond returns to England {{to be given}} another lead: the College of Arms in London <b>has</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> Blofeld has assumed the title and name Comte Balthazar de Bleuville and wants formal confirmation of the title and has asked the College to declare him the reigning count.|$|E
5|$|The {{release of}} the Flood prompts Halo's AI monitor, 343 Guilty Spark, to recruit Master Chief in {{retrieving}} the Index, a device that will activate Halo and prevent the Flood from spreading beyond the facility. After Master Chief retrieves and prepares to use the Index, Cortana re-appears and warns him against the activation. She <b>has</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> Halo's defense system is a weapon designed to kill all sentient life in the galaxy, which will deny the host bodies the Flood requires to spread, a revelation which Guilty Spark confirms.|$|E
5|$|Black {{tracks the}} history of the second kidnapper, finding that he was {{involved}} in a military medical group; Swan's name is also associated with this group. As Black is investigating, Watts approaches him, showing him a second photograph of Taylor, now looking sickly, beside the canister. Watts believes she has less than two days to live. Meanwhile, Hollis <b>has</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> Swan frequently called Art Bell's Coast to Coast AM radio show under a pseudonym to discuss conspiracy theories about Gulf War syndrome. Bell invites Black onto the show to speak to a listening Swan; the two realise that Black's wife was killed by a pathogen Swan was ordered to test on his troops during the Gulf War—an order which came from a group outside of the Army.|$|E

5|$|The USS Enterprise is {{on patrol}} near the Romulan neutral zone {{and the crew}} is {{experiencing}} unusual dreams. Captain James T. Kirk and Science Officer Spock both confess that they are having dreams that Spock is Captain {{of the ship and}} Kirk is an Ensign. Kirk informs Spock that Starfleet intelligence <b>has</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the Romulans are attempting to use time travel and are sending more ships to investigate. Captain Kirk goes to sleep, and awakes as Ensign Kirk on the VSS ShiKahr, which appears to otherwise be the Enterprise. The Ensign is a drug addled ex-convict who has been on board for only a day.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In the episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a bizarre rock inscribed with Navajo writing found in Côte d'Ivoire, {{and the death of}} the African scientist involved. While its appearance in Washington begins to affect Mulder’s mental health, leading him to turn to Agent Fowley for help; a disturbed Scully—determined to disprove the theory that life on Earth began with aliens—heads to New Mexico and finds a dying Albert Hosteen—who <b>has</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the rock includes passages from the Bible, and a map of the human genome. While Mulder breaks down in a mental institution, Scully journeys unexpectedly to Africa.|$|E
5|$|Another {{defense that}} often uses color or shape to deceive {{potential}} enemies is mimicry. A number of longhorn beetles (family Cerambycidae) bear {{a striking resemblance}} to wasps, which helps them avoid predation even though the beetles are in fact harmless. Batesian and Müllerian mimicry complexes are commonly found in Lepidoptera. Genetic polymorphism and natural selection give rise to otherwise edible species (the mimic) gaining a survival advantage by resembling inedible species (the model). Such a mimicry complex is referred to as Batesian and is most commonly known by the mimicry by the limenitidine viceroy butterfly of the inedible danaine monarch. Later research <b>has</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the viceroy is, in fact more toxic than the monarch and this resemblance should be considered as a case of Müllerian mimicry. In Müllerian mimicry, inedible species, usually within a taxonomic order, find it advantageous to resemble each other so as to reduce the sampling rate by predators who need to learn about the insects' inedibility. Taxa from the toxic genus Heliconius form one of the most well known Müllerian complexes.|$|E

5|$|As {{numerous}} collectors {{had visited}} Negros prior to 1953 {{and did not}} record the species, {{it is likely that}} it was already very rare by the time of its discovery. It is suspected that the Negros fruit dove was originally a lowland species, but the destruction of forests in northern Negros forced the dove from its ideal habitat and led to its probable extinction. Today, no forest exists in northern Negros at an elevation lower than , and several searches in the 1990s of Mount Kanlaon and the surrounding area failed to discover any sign of the species' continued existence. Ornithological fieldwork <b>has</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the nearby island of Panay is home to some species previously thought to be endemic to Negros, including the Negros bleeding-heart. This discovery and the presence of unexplored lowland forests on Panay give hope that the Negros fruit dove may still exist in low numbers on a nearby island. Other than the depiction of the bird on a Philippine environmental education poster in the 1990s, no conservation measures have been enacted to protect any surviving population.|$|E
25|$|One author, repeating an oft-referenced claim, {{contends that}} twenty Basque whaleships were sighted {{by the western}} tip of Iceland off Grunderfjord (Grundarfjörður) in 1412. This claim has been {{revealed}} to be false. The Icelandic historian Trausti Einarsson (1987) <b>has</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> this was a reference to twenty foreign ships fishing off Iceland, as the English and other nations were fishing for cod there by the early 15th century.|$|E
25|$|Records of the Jewish {{history of}} Mali {{can still be}} found in the Kati Andalusi library. Ismael Diadie Haidara, a {{historian}} from Timbuktu, possesses old Arabic and Hebrew texts among the city's historical records. He has also researched his own past and discovered that he is descended from the Moroccan Jewish traders of the Abana family. As he interviewed elders in the villages of his relatives, he <b>has</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> knowledge of the family's Jewish identity has been preserved, in secret, out of fear of persecution.|$|E

25|$|Research in anomalistic {{psychology}} <b>has</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> in {{some cases}} telepathy {{can be explained by}} a covariation bias. In an experiment (Schienle et al. 1996) 22 believers and 20 skeptics were asked to judge the covariation between transmitted symbols and the corresponding feedback given by a receiver. According to the results the believers overestimated the number of successful transmissions whilst the skeptics made accurate hit judgments. The results from another telepathy experiment involving 48 undergraduate college students (Rudski, 2002) were explained by hindsight and confirmation biases.|$|E
25|$|Two of the Jets, A-Rab and Baby John, are set on by Officer Krupke, {{but they}} manage to escape him. They meet {{the rest of the}} gang. To cheer {{themselves}} up, they lampoon Officer Krupke, and the other adults who don't understand them ("Gee Officer Krupke"). Anybodys arrives and tells the Jets she has been spying on the Puerto Ricans; she <b>has</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> Chino is looking for Tony with a gun. The gang separates to find Tony. Action has taken charge; he accepts Anybodys into the Jets and includes her in the search.|$|E
25|$|During the season, Vincent and Cat briefly {{break up}} with each other, due to Vincent having changed so much because of Muirfield wiping his memory. Cat starts a {{relationship}} with Gabe, a previous beast, now turned ally, while Vincent starts to date Tori, a wealthy socialite who <b>has</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> {{she is also a}} Beast. Eventually, after regaining his memories and Tori's death during the season, Vincent realizes that he is still in love with Cat and tries to win her back, but she rejects his advances. However, slowly she starts to realize that she still loves him and they both get back together {{near the end of the}} season.|$|E

25|$|The {{party is}} joined by Baron Vordenburg, the {{descendant}} of the hero who rid the area of vampires long ago. Vordenburg, an authority on vampires, <b>has</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> his ancestor was romantically involved with the Countess Karnstein before she died {{and became one of}} the undead. Using his forefather's notes, he locates Mircalla's hidden tomb. An Imperial Commission exhumes the vampire's body. Immersed in blood, it seems to be breathing faintly, its heart beating, its eyes open. A stake is driven through its heart, and it gives a corresponding shriek; then the head is struck off. The body and head are burned to ashes, which are thrown into a river.|$|E
25|$|Autism {{spectrum}} disorders (ASD) {{are a large}} {{focus of}} the Institute’s research and clinical programs. Autism is typically diagnosed by age three, however the Institute’s research is focused on detecting signs of the disorder even earlier. One of the pioneers of autism research today is Dr. Rebecca Landa, Director of the Center for Autism & Related Disorders at Kennedy Krieger. Landa <b>has</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> some babies begin to show risk factors for autism as early as 14 months of age. Her work also focuses on developing early intervention models for toddlers with autism that help to improve a child’s social, language, and cognitive skills.|$|E
25|$|Studies with captive {{birds have}} given insight into which birds {{are the most}} intelligent. While parrots have the {{distinction}} of being able to mimic human speech, studies with the African grey parrot have shown that some are able to associate words with their meanings and form simple sentences (see Alex). Parrots and the corvid family of crows, ravens, and jays are considered the most intelligent of birds. Not surprisingly, research has shown that these species tend to have the largest HVCs. Dr. Harvey J. Karten, a neuroscientist at UCSD who has studied the physiology of birds, <b>has</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the lower parts of avian brains {{are similar to those of}} humans.|$|E

25|$|Dredd {{arrives in}} Brit-Cit, where ostensibly the British judges refuse to help him. However {{this is a}} ruse, and they offer Dredd all {{possible}} assistance short of outright military assault on Narcos's forces. Dredd recruits a squad of American judges from Mega-City One's embassy in Brit-Cit, and they fly in a Brit-Cit Justice Department airship to the Cursed Earth desert outside Mega-City One. Brit-Cit <b>has</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> Narcos has four spaceships landed in the Cursed Earth, each containing thousands of Assassinator droids. Dredd's squad infiltrates one of them, seizes it and reprograms the robots on board to fight for them. Brit-Cit then destroys the other three ships, ending Narcos's supply of reinforcements at a stroke.|$|E
25|$|Silverstone {{appeared}} with Queen Latifah {{as one of}} the stylists in the comedy Beauty Shop (2005), a spinoff of the Barbershop film franchise. She next starred in the dramatic thriller Silence Becomes You, which received a DVD release in October 2005. Silverstone did a pilot episode in 2005 with FOX called Queen B, in which she played a former high school prom queen who <b>has</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> the real world is nothing like high school, but it was not picked up for production. In 2006, she starred in an ABC pilot called Pink Collar as a woman working in a law firm, but like Queen B, this pilot was not picked up to series.|$|E
25|$|Shrines {{can also}} be found in the back of all kinds of stores and gas stations. As veneration of Santa Muerte becomes more accepted, stores specializing in {{religious}} articles, such as botánicas, are carrying more and more paraphernalia related to the cult. Historian R. Andrew Chesnut <b>has</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> many botanicas in both Mexico and the U.S. are kept in business by sales of Santa Muerte paraphernalia, with numerous shops earning up to half of their profits on Santa Muerte items. This is true even of stores in very well known locations such as Pasaje Catedral behind the Mexico City Cathedral, which is mostly dedicated to store selling Catholic liturgical items. Her image is a staple in esoterica shops.|$|E
25|$|Mathematicians <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> it is {{possible}} in principle to have multiple bodies in non-elliptical orbits that repeat periodically, although most such orbits are not stable regarding small perturbations in mass, position, or velocity. However, some special stable cases have been identified, including a planar figure-eight orbit occupied by three moving bodies. Further studies <b>have</b> <b>discovered</b> <b>that</b> nonplanar orbits are also possible, including one involving 12 masses moving in 4 roughly circular, interlocking orbits topologically equivalent {{to the edges of}} a cuboctahedron.|$|R
