40|$|The {{impact of}} salt {{delivery}} in mouth on salt perception was investigated. It {{was hypothesized that}} fast concentration changes in the delivery to the receptor can reduce sensory adaptation, leading to an increased taste perception. Saltiness ratings were scored by a panel over time during various stimulation conditions involving relative changes in NaCl concentration of 20 % and 38 %. Changes in salt delivery profile had similar effect on saltiness perception when delivered either by a sipwise method or by a <b>gustometer.</b> The impact of concentration variations and frequency of concentration changes was further investigated with the <b>gustometer</b> method. Five second boosts and 2 s pulses were delivered during 3 sequential 10 -s intervals, whereas the delivered total salt content was {{the same for all}} conditions. Two second pulses were found to increase saltiness perception, but only when the pulses were delivered during the first seconds of stimulation. Results suggest that the frequency, timing, and concentration differences of salt stimuli can affect saltiness. Specifically, a short and intense stimulus can increase salt perception, possibly through a reduction of adaptation...|$|E
40|$|Amiloride, an {{epithelial}} {{sodium channel}} blocker, suppresses the responsiveness of narrowly tuned sodium-responsive taste afferents when orally {{applied in the}} rat. Broadly tuned salt-responsive taste afferents, which respond to sodium and non-sodium salts and acids, are relatively unaffected by the drug. We used amiloride treatment to examine {{the consequences of the}} specific removal of input from narrowly tuned sodium-responsive afferents on taste discrimination. Five water-restricted rats were trained in a <b>gustometer</b> to press one lever after licking NaCl and another lever after licking KCl across a range of concentrations (0. 05, 0. 1, and 0. 2 M). Correct re-sponses were rewarded with brief water access, and incorrect responses were punished with a time-out. After training, ani-mals averaged about 90 % correct responses and maintained competent performance during subsequent control sessions...|$|E
40|$|In this article, we numerically {{resolve the}} flow {{profiles}} of tastant {{concentration in the}} pipe of a <b>gustometer</b> used to deliver alternative pulses in concentration, which is a typical case of Taylor dispersion. Using this model, we can define the cases where the experimenter will deliver to the assessors a concentration profile which is significantly different from that intended. This can be simply assessed a priori using a scaling argument which involves calculating a dimensionless frequency. This {{is a function of}} the pulses frequency, the dimensions of the pipe and the flow rate used. We show that unless this parameter is taken into account, modifying the pulse frequency will modify the pulse amplitude. This design criterion is absent from the literature but we suggest this is important for designing such experiments...|$|E
40|$|Recently, we {{reported}} that large bilateral gustatory cortex (GC) lesions significantly impair taste sensitivity to salts in rats. Here we extended the tastants examined to include sucrose and quinine in rats with ibotenic acid-induced lesions in GC (GCX) and in sham-operated controls (SHAM). Presurgically, immediately after drinking NaCl, rats received a LiCl or saline injection (i. p.), but postsurgical tests indicated a weak conditioned taste aversion (CTA) even in controls. The rats were then trained and tested in <b>gustometers</b> to discriminate a tastant from {{water in a}} two-response operant taste detection task. Psychometric functions were derived for sucrose, KCl, and quinine. Our mapping system {{was used to determine}} placement, size, and symmetry of the lesions (~ 91 % GC damage on average). For KCl, there was a significant rightward shift (ΔEC 50 = 0. 57 log 10 units; p< 0. 001) in the GCX psy-chometric function relative to SHAM, replicating our prior work. There was also a significant lesion-induced impairment (ΔEC 50 = 0. 41 log 10 units; p = 0. 006) in quinine sensitivity. Sur-prisingly, taste sensitivity to sucrose was unaffected by the extensive lesions and was com-parable between GCX and SHAM rats. The fact that such large bilateral GC lesions did no...|$|R
40|$|There is an {{increased}} urgency, {{advocated by the}} WHO, to reduce the sodium content in food products. A significant lower sodium intake of the world population should lead to reduced incidences {{of high blood pressure}} and associated cardiovascular diseases. A number of approaches can be taken to reduce sodium: via adaptation, salt substitutes, multisensory principles and salt boosters. Other ways to enhance perception were explored as a means to reduce sodium, by building further on the generic principle of receptors as contrast detectors. The increase of saltiness perception was investigated via controlled delivery of ‘high-in-salt pulses’ into the mouth of assessors using a <b>gustometer.</b> A significant effect on saltiness perception for 2 second ‘high-in-salt pulses ’ was shown, as compared to constant salt delivery. These results suggest that saltiness perception may be modified by changing the salt delivery profile...|$|E
40|$|Gastrin-releasing-peptide 1 – 27 (GRP) {{has been}} implicated in the {{regulation}} of satiety and appetite in numerous paradigms. However, the specific site and mode of action of this gut–brain peptide has not been elucidated. The following experiment {{examined the effects of}} GRP on taste responses to sucrose in the behaving rat. A brief-exposure, multi-bottle <b>gustometer</b> was used to provide rats with momentary access to six different concentrations of sucrose in a single test session. This procedure has been used previously, resulting in monotonically increased licking behavior as concentrations of sucrose increase. Differing injection procedures were employed such that rats were tested immediately after i. p. injection or 5 min after i. p. injection of 5 nmol/kg body wt of GRP. Results indicate that GRP does reduce the oral reinforcing properties of sucrose, but the effect is transient, diminishing significantly within 5 min after injection.

40|$|To {{disentangle}} taste from reward {{responses in}} the human gustatory cortex, we combined high density electro-encephalography with a <b>gustometer</b> delivering tastant puffs {{to the tip of}} the tongue. Stimuli were pure tastants (salt solutions at two concentrations), caloric emulsions of identical taste (two milk preparations differing in fat content) and a mixture of high fat milk with the lowest salt concentration. Early event-related potentials showed a dose-response effect for increased taste intensity, with higher amplitude and shorter latency for high compared to low salt concentration, but not for increased fat content. However, the amplitude and distribution of late potentials were modulated by fat content independently of reported intensity and discrimination. Neural source estimation revealed a sustained activation of reward areas to the two high-fat stimuli. The results suggest calorie detection through specific sensors on the tongue independent of perceived taste. Finally, amplitude variation of the first peak in the event-related potential to the different stimuli correlated with papilla density, suggesting a higher discrimination power for subjects with more fungiform papillae...|$|E
40|$|The Otsuka Long Evans Tokushima Fatty (OLETF) rats {{lack the}} CCK- 1 receptor, are hyperphagic, {{progressively}} become obese, and develop type- 2 diabetes. We recently demonstrated an increased preference for both real and sham feeding of sucrose in this strain suggesting altered orosensory sensitivity. To investigate taste functions, we used an automated <b>gustometer</b> with 10 -sec access to different concentrations of various sapid stimuli. Tests were repeated at 10 and 18 weeks of age {{to assess the}} early and advanced stages of pre-diabetes, respectively. Compared with age-matched, non-mutant controls, the OLETF rats showed higher avidity for sucrose at both ages. This difference increased {{as a function of}} age and tastant concentration. An exaggerated response also occurred for saccharin, alanine, and fructose, but not for Polycose. Similarly, OLETF rats consumed monosodium-glutamate more at the lower concentrations compared with controls, an effect that age also accentuated. In contrast, there was no statistical strain or age differences in responses to NaCl, MgCl 2, citric acid, quinine-HCl and the trigeminal stimulus, capsaicin. These findings demonstrate that compared to controls, OLETF rats differ in their gustatory functions with an overall augmented sensitivity for swee...|$|E
40|$|While {{studies of}} the {{gustatory}} cortex (GC) mostly focus on its role in taste aversion learning and memory, the necessity of GC for other fundamental taste-guided behaviors remains largely untested. Here, rats with either excitotoxic lesions targeting GC (n = 26) or sham le-sions (n = 14) were assessed for postsurgical retention of a presurgically LiCl-induced con-ditioned taste aversion (CTA) to 0. 1 M sucrose using a brief-access taste generalization test in a <b>gustometer.</b> The same animals were then trained in a two-response operant taste de-tection task and psychophysically tested for their salt (NaCl or KCl) sensitivity. Next, the rats were trained and tested in a NaCl vs. KCl taste discrimination task with concentrations var-ied. Rats meeting our histological inclusion criterion had large lesions (resulting in a group averaging 80 % damage to GC and involving surrounding regions) and showed impaired postsurgical expression of the presurgical CTA (LiCl-injected, n = 9), demonstrated right-ward shifts in the NaCl (0. 54 log 10 shift) and KCl (0. 35 log 10 shift) psychometric functions, and displayed retarded salt discrimination acquisition (n = 18), but eventually learned and performed the discrimination comparable to sham-operated animals.

40|$|Eating implies mutual {{interactions}} between different senses. In the present work we aimed at studying relations between food texture and food odor, using both psychophysical and imaging techniques. Eighteen right-handed healthy human subjects participated to both behavioral and fMRI sessions. Fresh, sweetened milk {{and a more}} thickened version were delivered orally; in addition, a buttery-cream aroma was presented ortho- or retronasally. Stimuli were applied using a <b>gustometer</b> and or an air-dilution olfactometer, both computer-controlled. In each session subjects rated separately odor-, taste- and thickness intensities of the stimuli. The behavioral data show that odors, presented through either retro- or orthonasal path, induce a significant flavor enhancement {{with respect to the}} no-odor condition. Brain functional data indicated a significant enhancement of the activation of olfactory eloquent areas in favor of ortho-nasal odor presentation while activations of mechanosensory areas were favored by the retro-nasal odor route. As effect of oral stimuli we found a significant correlation between the texture intensity rating vs. the BOLD signal in the supplementary motor area, known to drive subconsciously primed movement, putatively associated in this case with the tongue movement required with the handling of the stimulus. Moreover, we found inhibition of the signal in different sensory specific areas as an effect of the mutual interaction between stimulus qualities. In conclusion, ortho- and retronasal odors differentially affect the neural processing of the texture of oral stimuli...|$|E
40|$|Sodium taste {{transduction}} {{is thought}} to occur via an amiloride-sensitive, sodium-selective pathway and an amiloride-insensitive, cation nonselective, anion-dependent pathway(s). It has been shown by others that amiloride, an epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) blocker, significantly reduces the chorda tympani nerve response to lingually applied NaCl in C 57 BL/ 6 (B 6) mice but not in DBA/ 2 (D 2) mice, suggesting that the latter strain might not possess functional ENaCs in taste receptor cells. We psychophysically measured and compared taste detection thresholds of NaCl and sodium gluconate (NaGlu) prepared with and without 100 µM amiloride in these two strains (eight/strain). Mice were trained and tested in a two-response operant signal detection procedure conducted in a <b>gustometer.</b> Surprisingly, no strain effect was found for the detection thresholds of both salts (~ 0. 05 – 0. 06 M). Moreover, these thresholds were increased by almost {{an order of magnitude}} by amiloride adulteration of the solutions. This marked effect of amiloride on sodium detection thresholds suggests that ENaCs are necessary for normal sensitivity to sodium salts in both strains. In addition, because NaGlu {{is thought to}} stimulate primarily the amiloride-sensitive pathway, especially at low concentrations, the similarity of NaCl and NaGlu thresholds (r> 0. 81 both strains) suggests that ENaCs are also sufficient to support the detection of sodium in weak solutions by B 6 and D 2 mice.

40|$|Little {{is known}} about how {{specific}} genes influence taste function in mammals. One {{of the most promising}} ways to fill this void is to screen the progeny of chemically mutagenized (or genetically altered) mice for aberrant taste phenotypes and then identify the mutated gene(s) that is associated with each taste anomaly. To exploit this approach, a high-throughput and robust screening procedure is needed. We have attempted to meet this demand by developing an automated procedure that assesses taste responsiveness of individual mice to palatable and unpalatable taste stimuli. We focused on three taste stimuli (quinine hydrochloride, QHCl; sodium chloride, NaCl; and sucrose) and one mouse strain (C 57 BL/ 6). We used a commercially available <b>gustometer</b> system that both monitors the licking responses of mice and controls the presentation of each taste stimulus during successive 5 s trials. We describe a screening procedure that (after 2 days of simple training) can generate a concentration–response curve for NaCl or sucrose during a single 30 min test session, and for QHCl over three 30 min test sessions. A normative database based on the responses of 98 mice subjected to our screening procedure is also presented. We envision that investigators could use this normative database to assess taste function in the progeny of mutagenized (or genetically altered) mice. Any mouse that deviates significantly—e. g. three standard deviations (SD) —from the mean of the normative database would be flagged as having a potentially interesting mutation. We also developed an additional second screen for identifying mice with oromotor abnormalities. This latter screen is necessary because oromotor problems coul...|$|E
40|$|The {{epithelial}} {{sodium channel}} (ENaC) blocker amiloride {{has been shown}} to increase the behaviorally measured NaCl detection threshold in mice. In this study, a conditioned taste aversion (CTA) paradigm was used to examine whether 100 µM amiloride has a perceptible taste that could contribute to this observed decrease in behavioral responsiveness. Eighty-four C 57 BL/ 6 J (B 6) and 64 DBA/ 2 J (D 2) mice were divided into eight groups (n = 8 – 12 per group), in which half received an injection of 0. 15 M LiCl (2 mEq/kg) and the other half an equivalent saline injection, in three conditioning trials. The four conditioned stimuli were 100 µM amiloride hydrochloride, water, 0. 1 and 0. 3 M NaCl. Neither strain demonstrated acquisition of a CTA to amiloride in a brief-access (BA) taste test (5 s trials in the <b>gustometer).</b> Although 0. 3 M NaCl is inherently aversive, its pairing with LiCl led to significantly further decreases in licking during the BA test on salt trials in both strains. The D 2 strain clearly avoided 0. 1 M NaCl, whereas avoidance of this stimulus was more equivocal in B 6 mice. The inefficacy of amiloride to serve as a conditioned stimulus in taste aversion learning involving three LiCl pairings suggests that the effects of this ENaC blocker on taste-related behavioral responses to NaCl are likely due to its pharmacological interference with sodium taste transduction.

40|$|In general, rodents prefer both sucrose and L-serine {{relative}} to water and treat both compounds as possessing a similar taste quality (e. g. ‘sweetness’) despite {{that they are}} believed to bind with different T 1 R heterodimeric receptors in taste bud cells. We assessed the affective potency of these compounds along with glycine, which is thought to bind with both T 1 R receptor complexes, using a brief-access taste test in a <b>gustometer.</b> Unconditioned licking responses of two ‘taster ’ strains (C 57 BL/ 6 J and SWR/J), which display high preference for low concentrations of sucrose, and two ‘non-taster ’ (129 P 3 /J and DBA/ 2 J) strains, which display blunted preference for low concentrations of sucrose, were measured during 5 s trials of varying concen-trations of a single compound when mice (n = 10 /strain/stimulus) were non-deprived and when access to home-cage water was restricted. In non-deprived mice, sucrose generated monotonically increasing concentration–response curves regardless of strain, whereas glycine was only marginally effective at stimulating licking and L-serine produced relatively flat functions. The profile of responsiveness across strains was more complex than expected. For example, when tested with sucrose in the non-deprived condition, the 129 P 3 /J non-taster strain surpassed the responsiveness of taster mice at mid-range to high concentra-tions. Under water-restricted conditions, these mice also were significantly more responsive to high concentrations of both sucrose and glycine compared with the other strains when stimulus licking was standardized {{relative to}} water. Thus, the affec-tive potency of the stimuli tested here seems {{to be related to}} the ability of the compounds to bind with the T 1 R 2 + 3 recepto...|$|E
40|$|Mouse strains {{have been}} divided into ‘tasters ’ and ‘non-tasters ’ {{based on their}} {{relatively}} high and low preference, respectively, for low concentrations of sucrose and saccharin. These phenotypic differences appear {{to be due to}} a polymorphism in the gene at the Sac locus encoding for the T 1 R 3 taste receptor selectively affecting the functionality of the T 1 R 2 + 3 heterodimer. To psychophysically examine whether these phenotypes are due to sensory sensitivity as opposed to hedonic responsiveness, we measured taste signal detection of sucrose, glucose, and glycine by Sac taster (C 57 BL/ 6 J and SWR/J) and non-taster (129 P 3 /J and DBA/ 2 J) strains in an operant conditioning paradigm using a <b>gustometer.</b> The taster mice had lower detection thresholds for sucrose and glucose compared with the non-taster mice. The detection thresholds corresponded well with reported respon-siveness to low concentrations of these sugars in two-bottle intake tests suggesting that the Sac taster phenotype has a sensory basis and is {{not simply a matter of}} strain differences in the hedonic evaluation of weak intensities of the stimuli. Taster status did not entirely account for the strain differences in detection thresholds for glycine, a ‘sweet ’ tasting amino acid. Collapsed across strains, detection thresholds for sucrose and glucose were highly correlated with each other (r = 0. 81), but only modestly correlated with those for glycine (r ≤ 0. 43). This suggests that stimulus processing of glycine in the perithreshold intensity domain can be dissociated from that of sucrose and glucose. The mechanism underlying this difference may be related to the ability of glycine to bind with the T 1 R 1 + 3 heterodimer.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to explore human {{gustatory}} processing {{and how it is}} influenced by appetite and expectancy. The initial two years of the doctorate were dedicated to developing a <b>gustometer</b> mechanism and taste stimulus set to employ in the experimental investigations. Event-related potentials (ERPs), source-localised ERPs and event-related de-synchronisations and synchronisations (ERD/S) were then evaluated in response to taste characteristics under a variety of conditions. The first experiment assessed the ERP, source-localisation and ERD/S components associated with the processing of taste quality (sweet, salt, bitter, water), intensity (neutral, weak, medium, strong) and hedonicity (pleasant, unpleasant, neutral). Gustatory stimulation evoked activations within the primary gustatory cortex (PGC) and intensity was represented in early ERP epochs and by alpha- and beta-band ERD. Hedonicity was coded in late ERP epochs and by alpha-band ERD. Taste quality coding was difficult to determine from the EEG data. The second experiment compared the processing of pleasant sweet and unpleasant bitter tastes during states of hunger following overnight fasting and satiety induced by a standardised liquid meal. Hunger and satiety evoked maximal responses to tastes from limbic regions. Hunger greatly enhanced ERP and beta-band ERS responses to tastes in general. However, responses to sweet tastes were dependent on hunger state; with enhanced neural signals in response to sweet taste after satiating on a sweet meal - suggesting differential attentional and evaluative mechanisms employed under fasted and fed conditions. A final experiment examined the influence of cue-elicited expectancy on the processing of sweet tastes. Participants were validly or invalidly cued to expect a low- or high-concentration of sweet taste; both behavioural and neural responses to invalidly cued tastes assimilated to those that were produced by the taste the participants were cued to receive. These effects began ~ 100 ms after the onset of the tastes, suggesting that expectancy influences the early perceptual processing of taste. The overall findings of this thesis provide some of the first accounts of the temporal, source-localised and oscillatory dynamics of gustatory coding. The results also provide important implications for understanding how people’s experience of taste and food can be modified by appetite and expectancy...|$|E
40|$|In {{the light}} of {{increasing}} rates of nutrition related diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, {{high blood pressure and}} stroke it is necessary to reduce sugar, salt and fat contents of industrial produced food. Reduction of those components generally leads to changes of the sensory properties of the products and rejection by the consumer. Traditional compensation strategies like the use of taste enhancers, artificial sweeteners or fat replacers often lead to off-flavours and consequently to consumer rejection. This thesis describes cross-modal interactions as an alternative strategy to reduce sugar, salt and fat. In the past cross-modal interactions have been describe to influence taste and texture perception, however up to now research focused on simple model systems lacking in perceptual, as well as chemical complexity. This thesis aimed on the application of cross modal interactions involving aroma modification to complex food systems, such as apple juice and cheese. It was investigated whether aromas are able to modify taste perception in complex food matrices and what the driving factors are to which extend aromas can enhance taste perception. Furthermore different cross modal approaches were combined in order to investigate possible additive or synergistic effects on taste enhancement. At first, the question whether individual aroma components can be identified that have the capacity to enhance taste perception in a complex beverage was addressed [chapter 2]. Apple juice was choosen to represent a complex matrix where interactions between taste and aroma are a natural product characteristic. Ethylhexanoate was identified to significantly enhance sweetness in apple juice, while three other esters selected on the same basis did not show sweetness enhancement. Ethylhexanoate induced sweetness enhancement appeared to be concentration dependent. Concentrations of 5 ppm were found to be most effective to enhance sweetness in this specific system. However, next to sweetness undesired attributes such as flowery and synthetic were also increased significantly. As a conclusion it has to be noticed that flavour balance in complex food is fragile and has to be carefully altered in order to use odour induced taste enhancement as a tool in sugar, salt and fat reduction. Chapter 3 describes the masking of off-flavours induced by ethylhexanoate as described in chapter 2. It was hypothesised that ethylhexanoate induced off-flavours can be masked by restoring flavour balance by equally adding combinations of all four esters. A combination of ethylhexanoate, ethylbutanoate and ethyl- 2 -methylbutanoate was found to be most effective to restore flavour quality while maintaining ethylhexanoate induced sweetness enhancement. It was concluded that all components that are naturally part of an aroma are needed to achieve a balanced product. Optimisation of odour presentation time in order to achieve maximum taste enhancement was subject to the study described in chapter 4. Swallowing is the key to aroma release during food consumption. It was demonstrated that aroma is most presented most effectively either 1. 7 – 2. 5 seconds before or 2. 6 – 3. 6 seconds after the moment of swallow. Aroma presented directly at the moment of swallow was found to be least effective to enhance taste. It is assumed that olfactory receptor neurons (ORN) do not transmit the activation signal to the brain at the exact moment of swallow in order to spare energy and function most effective, as during normal food consumption the aroma is released shortly after swallowing. This hypothesis was further tested in an fMRI study. Preliminary results support this theory, however at the moment of completion of this thesis data evaluation was still in progress. In chapter 5 further optimisation of odour/taste interactions was studied, by investigating the influence of temperature on odour induced taste enhancement. Consumption temperatures differ strongly among products. As aroma release strongly depends on the temperature of the food, it was hypothesised that the magnitude of aroma effects on taste perception changes over consumption temperature. Subjects consumed a sweet and a savoury system at four different temperatures (7, 25, 37 and 50 °C). Stimuli temperature and odour presentation were fully controlled by temperature optimised gustometry and olfactometry. Both aroma/taste systems were known to have induced taste enhancement in the past (sweet: apple flavoured tea/ethylhexanoate; savoury: broth/sotolon). No significant effect of temperature was found for either of the stimulus pairs. Results indicate that the complexity of the experiment led to confusion by the panelists under fully randomised stimuli delivery conditions. It was therefore concluded, that temperature effects on the magnitude of odour induced taste enhancement need to be studied in a reduced experimental design. Temporal contrast as a strategy to enhance salty taste was studied in the experiments described in chapter 6. Salty solutions of different NaCl concentrations were presented in alternating sequence by a <b>gustometer,</b> creating a sensory contrast of low-in salt and high-in salt pulses. It was demonstrated that the sensory contrast induced by the pulsed delivery led to significant taste enhancement. It was shown that high concentrations of NaCl delivered in short pulses were most effective to enhance salty taste. It was concluded that pulsed stimulus delivery can be an additional tool to reduce salt and sugar concentrations in industrial produced food. Chapter 7 combines both cross-modal strategies to enhance taste in this thesis so far, odour induced taste enhancement and temporal contrast of stimulus delivery. Subjects were presented with taste and aroma pulses timed via a <b>gustometer.</b> The aroma was either presented in-phase or out-of-phase with the taste stimulus. A cumulative effect of aroma/taste interactions and temporal contrast of tastant delivery was found, resulting in higher taste enhancement than each of the strategies alone. Overall highest sweetness enhancement was observed when aroma and taste pulses were presented out-of-phase. Texture modification is a third cross-modal strategy to enhance taste perception. Combinatory effects of texture modification and odour induced taste enhancement are subject to the study reported in chapter 8. Apple juice containing gels were engineered differing in textural properties, aroma and sugar concentration. In contrast to the results presented in chapter 7, only an additive but no synergistic effect was found for those strategies. Texture modification was found to be more effective than aroma modification. Chapter 9 studies effects of aroma on the taste and the texture of cheese and dairy model gels. In the first study subjects consumed different types of cheese with and without a nose-clip. This way the contribution of the aroma phase on the flavour and texture perception of cheese was studied. Saltiness was influenced significantly by the aroma. It was concluded that the aroma of cheese strongly contributes to a cheeses salty taste. Furthermore it was observed that a decrease in cheese firmness strongly correlated with an increase in buttery aroma notes. This was further studied in fully controlled dairy model gels. For gels tasting of cream cheese a significant decrease in firmness was found upon increasing aroma concentration. No effect of butter aroma on firmness was found for yoghurt-like gels. This once more demonstrates the importance of congruency between stimuli. Only congruent sensory impressions can influence each other. In addition, an increase in creaminess was observed with increasing aroma concentration. The results described in chapter 9 clearly show that aromas cannot only modify taste perception, but also are a valid tool for texture modification. This thesis demonstrates for the first time, that flavour and texture modification and subsequently the reduction of sugar, salt and (possibly also) fat can be achieved by using cross modal interactions in complex food matrices. New methods have been developed and existing methods have been combined to study aroma/taste interactions in fully controlled settings. Its multidisciplinary approach combines chemical, physical and psychological knowledge in order to discuss and explain results. It furthermore shows that combinations of different strategies are most effective in order to achieve healthier products reduced in sugar, salt and fat.  ...|$|E
