Harsha hands over the reigns of the business empire to Karthik and leaves.|$|E
60|$|Of {{all those}} whom this strange rumour about Bosinney and Mrs. Soames reached, James {{was the most}} affected. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> {{forgotten}} how <b>he</b> <b>had</b> hovered, lanky and pale, in side whiskers of chestnut hue, round Emily, {{in the days of}} his own courtship. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> forgotten the small house in the purlieus of Mayfair, where <b>he</b> <b>had</b> spent the early days of his married life, or rather, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> forgotten the early days, not the small house,--a Forsyte never forgot a house--he had afterwards sold it at a clear profit of four hundred pounds.|$|R

5|$|In an {{interview}} with Kotaku after {{the announcement of the}} remaster, Schafer stated that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> considered the aspect of a Grim Fandango sequel to further expand on the setting that was created for the game. He felt the story would be a difficult component, as either they would have to figure a means to bring Manny back from his final reward, or otherwise build the story around a new character. However, one option he has considered to alleviate the issue is by creating an adventure game using an open-world mechanic similar to the Grand Theft Auto series.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} what happens to the Rocket Group {{immediately}} after this: the next time Quatermass is seen on screen (Quatermass, also released internationally as The Quatermass Conclusion and Quatermass IV, 1979) <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> been retired, living in retreat in the Scottish Highlands. He has recently become the guardian of his teenaged granddaughter Hettie after her parents were killed in a road accident in Germany. After Hettie runs away from home, he travels to London in search of her and finds a dystopian world there. Quatermass and the scientist Joe Kapp establish that an alien probe is causing the collapse of society by feeding on the world's youth, and Quatermass forms a plan to drive the intruder away by the detonation of a nuclear bomb. He presses the button to detonate it himself, with Hettie's help, and they are killed in the blast as the planet is saved.|$|E
5|$|The poet, {{of whose}} works I have {{undertaken}} the revision, may now begin {{to assume the}} dignity of an ancient, and claim the privilege of established fame and prescriptive veneration. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> outlived his century, the term commonly fixed as the test of literature merit. Whatever advantages he might once derive from personal allusions, local customs, or temporary opinions, have for many years been lost; and every topic of merriment, or motive of sorrow, which the modes of artificial life afforded him, now only obscure the scenes which they once illuminated. The effects of favour and competition are at an end; the tradition of his friendships and his enmities has perished; his works support no opinion with arguments, nor supply any faction with invectives; they can neither indulge vanity nor gratify malignity; but are read without any other reason than the desire of pleasure, and are therefore praised only as pleasure is obtained; yet, thus unassisted by interest or passion, they have past through variation of taste and changes of manners, and, as they devolved {{from one generation to}} another, have received new honours at every transmission.|$|E

25|$|Johnson {{was one of}} {{the first}} trombonists to embrace bebop music. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> been {{regarded}} as one of the leading trombonists of the post-swing era, exerting a pervasive influence on other jazz musicians.|$|E
25|$|Shepherd's legacy {{has been}} a matter of some debate since his death more than one hundred years ago. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> been {{maligned}} as a corrupt, cronyist political boss, often compared to Boss Tweed, the leader of the Tammany Hall political machine of the same time period.|$|E
60|$|In addition, {{one-quarter of}} all this was his, and he was what <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> dreamed of being--an oil producer.|$|R
60|$|Bostil's thought {{suffered}} a sudden, blank halt. Then, with realization, came the shock for which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> been prepared.|$|R

25|$|<b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> {{opposed the}} idea of federally {{mandated}} testing being used to measure student performance against federally determined national education standards. He voted against national testing measures first proposed by the Clinton administration; and he similarly has never supported the federal No Child Left Behind Act, which he voted against when it was proposed in 2001.|$|E
25|$|While <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> {{considered}} himself {{a member of}} the Democratic Party, Lieberman has been said by some to be more conservative than many Republicans. In February 2007, Lieberman spoke before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee in support of the confirmation of Sam Fox as ambassador to Belgium. Fox, a prominent Republican businessman and political donor, was a contributor to the Swift Boat Veterans for Truth campaign in 2004.|$|E
25|$|In Laredo, he {{established}} a jewelry manufacturing plant and went into business with an instructor from Laredo Community College, then known as Laredo Junior College. The partnership ended, as Tatangelo established his family-owned Frontier Novelty Company. He also established a plant in Nuevo Laredo, on the Mexican side of the Rio Grande, to assemble jewelry and optical products. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> been a booster of border issues. He was friendly with Nuevo Laredo mayors and {{a fan of the}} Tecolotes baseball team there.|$|E

50|$|In 2008, Rheingold {{became the}} first {{research}} fellow at the Institute for the Future, with which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> been affiliated.|$|R
50|$|He was {{recruited}} by Baylor, Henderson State, and Houston. He chose the latter, as <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> ambitions {{to attend the}} school.|$|R
25|$|Meanwhile, Eutichio della Castagna, {{an impoverished}} poet, sees the sign {{and decides to}} accept Raimondo's offer. Raimondo gives him the keys and {{provides}} him with a pistol in case he becomes frightened by the ghosts. In an aside to Callisto, Raimondo asks {{what happened to the}} lovely young orphan who had been sheltering there and confesses that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> loved her from afar. Callisto tells him that Annetta had left months ago and he has not heard from her since.|$|E
25|$|Sandoz {{becomes a}} slave/pet of a famed poet-songwriter, whose {{broadcasts}} first alerted Earth to Rakhat's existence. Sandoz is physically disfigured. In that culture, {{it is considered}} an honour to be dependent upon another, and likewise to have a dependent, a mutilation analogous {{to the practice of}} foot binding. The flesh between Sandoz's metacarpal bones is cut away to make it seem that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> elegant fingers like the hasta'akala plant (which grows on a stronger tree and is thus dependent). The disfiguration starts at Sandoz' wrists, and with which he cannot even feed himself. Sandoz, imprisoned in his master's home, is routinely forced to sexually satisfy the musician, along with his friends and colleagues. It is later revealed the songs which Sandoz had originally considered to be a divine revelation are in fact a kind of ballad pornography celebrating rape, relating the songwriter's sexual exploits on broadcast to the populace.|$|E
500|$|Romm {{lives in}} Washington, D.C. [...] <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> had an {{interest}} in comedy. From 1994 through 2007, he was a regular contributor to The Style Invitational, a weekly humor contest run by The Washington Post. Among his submissions was the winning entry of what was later declared to be the best overall week's results of the Style Invitational's first decade.

60|$|The cocassier {{thought this}} likely enough, {{and found it}} more comforting than saying his prayers--a trick which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> since lost.|$|R
500|$|<b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> been {{interested}} in issues associated with the Dawes Act, which broke up the communal reservation lands and assigned plots to individual households. [...] Connected with that was the federal government's first use of [...] "blood quantum" [...] to define individual membership in tribes, for {{what became known as}} the Dawes Rolls. Since re-establishing self-governments, federally recognized tribes have established their own criteria for enrollment as members, often related to descent from recognized historical lists, but less often requiring proofs of blood quantum. [...] Some of his published works address these issues, which he has interpreted as part of the federal government's policy of genocide against Native Americans.|$|E
500|$|While {{stressing}} over Chris' {{policy of}} not dating co-workers, Ann offers to help Leslie relax by getting her {{a prescription for}} Paxil, an antidepressant drug. Ben gives Andy and April cash and instructs them to buy home products at Bed Bath & Beyond, a chain of domestic merchandise retail stores. While there, Andy and April instead start to purchase several [...] "as seen on TV" [...] items, including Shake Weight dumbbells, Slap Chop kitchen gadgets and a Marshmallow Shooter. During the arts commission meeting, Tom {{describes himself as a}} [...] "small, slender man" [...] similar to actor Taye Diggs. In a different scene, Tom expresses anger that Jerry's painting is [...] "killing the Jay-Z vibe" [...] <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> been cultivating, a reference to the hip hop artist.|$|E
500|$|Approaching {{the end of}} his career, Major Howard [...] "Bunny" [...] Colvin of Baltimore's Western District {{wants to}} effect some real change in the troubled neighborhoods for which <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>long</b> been responsible. Without the {{knowledge}} of central command, Colvin sets up areas where police would monitor, but not punish, the drug trade. The police crack down severely on violence in these areas and also on drug trafficking elsewhere in the city. For many weeks, Colvin's experiment works and crime is reduced in his district. Colvin' superiors, the media and city politicians eventually find out about the arrangement and the [...] "Hamsterdam" [...] experiment ends. With top brass outraged, Colvin is forced to cease his actions, accept a demotion and retire from the Police Department on a lower-grade pension. Tommy Carcetti uses the scandal to make a grandstanding speech at a weekly Baltimore city council meeting.|$|E
60|$|Alan {{laid down}} his pipe, which <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> since {{suffered}} to go out, {{and set his}} two hands upon his knees.|$|R
60|$|If {{she were}} wrecked, the {{reckoning}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> put off must be fronted, for when his embarrassments were known his antagonists would combine {{and try to}} pull him down. One must pay for one's extravagance, but to pay would break him, and if he were broken, Mortimer would sneer and Grace treat him with humiliating pity. He would be their mother's pensioner, and to lose his independence was hard. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>long</b> ruled, and bullied, others.|$|R
