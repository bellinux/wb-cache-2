40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{contribute}} for the debate about the construction of governance spaces which guarantee the continuity of the regional development public policies, thus articulating actors and optimizing strategic projects in order to improve regional competitiveness ans sustainability. The call by European Union policymakers for wider and more direct involvement in improving European governance is coupled with the increased usage of new information and communications technologies (ICTs) by public administrations across the EU. Portugal has been strategically involved in a catching-up process with high investments in the areas of innovation and ICT infrastructures. This paper is based on the field work and on the results obtained by a research project that analyzed the Portuguese Digital Cities and Regions Program on a multi-dimensional way, covering mainly the areas of accessibility, e-government and territorial development. We argue that the recent revival of interest of the "digital" has been constructed around a rather narrow set of empirical and theoretical issues concerning mainly to technological innovation, neglecting other strategic political areas, such as the policies of governance and state re-territorialization, the concept of innovation and social innovation, the role of democracy and citizenship and tensions around social reproduction and sustainability across the digital cities and regions. The evidence provided by this research work shows that investments in ICT infrastructures, although very necessary, haven't been sufficient to create a sustainable knowledge-based living and working environment in Portugal. Most initiatives under the Digital Cities and Regions Program have been leading to interventions very much focused on infra-structure and undervaluing <b>intangibles.</b> <b>Regional</b> and city managers' and planners' attention could 2 ̆ 013 indeed should 2 ̆ 013 shift towards the 2 ̆ 018 softer' but critical issues of filling the knowledge, expertise and organizational gaps.

University-industry linkages {{have long been}} at the centre of academic and policy attention. In spite of the copious literature on different aspects of such linkages, there is still rather inconclusive evidence on both the specific nature of the interactions between universities and businesses and their regional/spatial dimension. This paper focuses on one particular type of linkage between university and business – joint research partnerships – and addresses two specific issues. Firstly, it investigates {{the extent to which}} research quality and geographical proximity bear an influence on the intensity of university-industry collaborations. Secondly, it explores the factors affecting the spatial profile (i. e. proximity versus distance) of university-business partnerships. On the basis of an original database on collaborative research grants awarded by the UK Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC) – integrated with other information sources – our findings generally support previous results highlighting the importance of geographical proximity in shaping university-industry collaborations. Yet, they indicate clearly that the spatial configuration of university-industry linkages is far from being a simple and uniform phenomenon, calling for greater caution when trying to apply “onesize-fits-all” and “picking winners” policy strategies.

40|$|Regional competitiveness, {{especially}} in the industrialised countries, is increasingly reliant {{on the availability of}} an adequate endowment of knowledge assets at the local level, like technological and human capital. These <b>intangible</b> factors enhance <b>regional</b> efficiency directly as inputs of the production function, but they also {{play a crucial role in}} allowing the territory to absorb the potential knowledge spillovers from the neighbouring regions. The aim of this paper is to analyse the role of the internal and external factors in determining the productivity level for a large set of regions belonging to the EU 27 plus Norway and Switzerland. We estimate a Cobb-Douglas production function over the period 2000 - 2008 where, in addition to the traditional inputs of physical capital and units of labour, we consider innovation activities and human capital endowments as relevant knowledge assets. We also control for other geographical and industrial features of the regions. In order to take into account the commonly found geographic association across regions, our analysis is carried out within the spatial panel econometric framework. Main results, robust to a wide array of sensitivity checks, show that knowledge assets exhibit positive and significant coefficients and the impact of human capital on GDP is higher than the one found for technological capital in most of the estimated empirical models. Moreover, we find evidence of spatial spillovers directly associated with the two immaterial assets, which turn out to be much more effective in the regions of the 12 new accession countries with respect to all other European regions. The significant presence of such spillovers emphasizes the important role played by highly educated labour forces in increasing the regions’ absorptive capacity of new external knowledge and in ensuring its effective use in the production process.

40|$|Mike Rennie 2 ̆ 7 s {{experience}} {{shows how}} far Indigenous community radio training can take you, writes ELLIE RENNIE LATE last week, {{a young man}} called Mike Rennie won the Queensland Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Student of the Year award, which recognises outstanding achievements in vocational education. Mike?s winning qualification was a Certificate 3 in Radio Broadcasting, completed through BIMA, the Brisbane Indigenous Media Association. BIMA is the not-for-profit organisation behind the Indigenous radio station 989 fm and its registered training organisation, Triple A Training. Mike?s mentor and the manager of BIMA, Tiga Bayles, also attended the awards ceremony. For Tiga and his colleagues, the win is {{a recognition of the}} importance of Indigenous media, particularly in terms of training and creative industries development. When I rang to pass on my congratulations (Mike?s my cousin) he still couldn?t believe that he had actually won, {{despite the fact that he}} knows the value of community radio training better than most. Mike now works as a trainer himself, teaching radio to Indigenous young people on Cape York peninsula. Mike (28) and his brother Dan (25) were adopted into my family as toddlers. They share the same birth mother who comes from the Kimberly and now lives in Darwin, where they sometimes visit. After leaving school, Mike studied to be a park ranger, but struggled to find work locally. Instead he became a landscaper and, later, a baker. In June 2004, both Mike and Dan began volunteering at 989 fm (formerly 4 AAA). The station, which commenced broadcasting under a community radio license in 1993, has a significant following. Under the guidance of Tiga Bayles, 989 fm is more ?mainstream? than most community broadcasters ? although it is completely unique in Brisbane, playing country and Indigenous music alongside Indigenous news. Bayles insists that Indigenous broadcasting does not have to sound amateurish, that it should appeal to a wide audience and strive for economic independence. Training is essential to that mission. Aside from the formal components of his training, Mike produced a three-hour program four times a week, participated in the Gympie Muster and Telstra Road to Tamworth interviews and organised a sponsorship deal with Ellaways Music. He also worked on a national current affairs program called ?The Wire? which is produced by the Triple A training team. He covered mining on Lake Cowal in NSW, the introduction of OPAL fuels in Central Australia and the proposed dam at Traveston Crossing in South East Queensland. Meanwhile, his brother Dan was employed as 989 fm?s drive-time DJ and has become something of a local celebrity. Mike now compiles AFL programming and produces his own half hour footy show. Both are broadcast on the National Indigenous Radio Service, a satellite service which distributes programming to Indigenous stations across the country. He also teaches classes at 989 fm and travels to Cape York with Triple A Training. Mike believes there is a real need for media training in remote Indigenous communities. Triple A has been quietly working towards improving skills in Cape York, focusing their attention on the benefits not only for individual students but for the media system as a whole. After an initial pilot, the Department of Education, Science and Training came on board for a two-year term, which they renewed earlier this year. The Cape York communities possess their own radio production equipment and transmitters, provided through the federal government?s Remote Indigenous Broadcasting program. Triple A Training?s involvement has enabled the stations to make local programs, which they supplement with the NIRS service. Mike and his colleagues use online and face-to-face methods, visiting the townships of Weipa, Kowanyama, Aurukun, Cooktown and Wujal Wujal in the Daintree every five to six weeks. Participants are also flown down to Brisbane for a week of intense training at the 989 fm studios. The training takes place in schools where attendance can be as low as 30 per cent. However, the fun of radio is getting kids back to class voluntarily. According to Bayles, the radio training has produced significant outcomes in terms of overall literacy, ?making reading and writing relevant? through tasks such as putting together an interview or reading the back of a CD case. Although accredited radio training has been available through TAFE colleges, Bayles believes that it can only succeed if it is designed for remote community needs and delivered by Indigenous media trainers. The ultimate aim is to get more stations producing local content, with the intention of setting up a regional content network. Bayles hopes that radio will become the hub of each community ? as essential as a local store, school or health clinic. For that to occur, the Indigenous media sector needs a structured plan that will create media jobs and professional standards, which Triple A Training is working towards. He insists that the community nature of remote Indigenous broadcasting does not have to mean bad quality. In the past, ?we have made ourselves look and sound stupid? because of a lack of skills. If the value of the resource is to be realised, young people need to be taught how to construct and communicate their thoughts effectively, while stations need to understand how to schedule programs to meet audience needs. Mike and Dan?s experience at 989 fm demonstrates the unique experience of community and Indigenous media training. Both have found meaningful work opportunities in an industry that is notoriously difficult to enter. Almost from the moment Mike started at 989 fm he was on-air, learning how to produce radio against deadlines and within the constraints of broadcasting law, ethics and practice. The station took him to real events, had him researching issues of local and national importance and introduced him to successful artists and leaders. Aside from the daily acquisition of skills, Mike was responsible to an audience. His communication skills transformed, both on-air and off. I could write about the impact it had on his personality (confidence, eloquence), but he is my little cousin and I know he?d hate me for it. I can say for certain, however, that 989 fm has given both Mike and Dan a deep connection to Indigenous culture and politics which they might otherwise have missed. In the remote communities, where Mike now works, the cultural and educational potential of community radio is equally, if not more, significant. When Mike commenced his training at Triple A Training, 989 fm was one of only five community radio stations to provide accredited courses. A year later, in 2005, the government fulfilled an election promise of 2. 2 million for community radio training, which is currently being administered by the Community Broadcasting Association of Australia. The programs that flow from this money (which are focusing on management training, particularly for ethnic, <b>regional,</b> print <b>handicapped</b> and Indigenous stations) will no doubt lift the standard and sustainability of community broadcasting. And, as community broadcasting is a common step towards employment in the national and commercial broadcasting sectors, industry as a whole should benefit. For the Indigenous sector, more intensive programs are required in order to raise digital literacy within communities, skill-up local media workers and create culturally appropriate courseware. Vocational training is already a hot election topic; it stands for jobs and sustainable industries. In the creative industries, training also results in social and cultural outcomes. Mike Rennie might be surprised that his community radio training could take him so far. In fact, it makes a great deal of sense. ?

40|$|Irrigation Management Transfer (IMT) {{policy has}} been {{formulated}} and implemented worldwide, relying on three basic assumptions: that the irrigation agency are motivated to adapt {{their role in the}} sector's development; that farmers are willing to take over the system management; and that the process of management transfer is a neutral process, involving primarily managerial and technical aspects. This thesis illuminates the political dimensions of IMT policy. IMT policy formulation and implementation in Indonesia was shaped by continuous power struggles at the different administrative levels. The way the IMT policy agenda was defined and redefined in respectively Irrigation Operation and Maintenance Project (IOMP) 1987 and the 1999 Water Sector Adjustment Loan (WATSAL) shows that the idea of management transfer did not always coincide with either the irrigation agency's perception or farmers' actual needs in the sector's development. Under IOMP 1987 the irrigation agency transformed IMT into a construction program. Similarly, under WATSAL, IMT was reduced as a policy instrument to eradicate bureaucratic rent-seeking within the irrigation agency. Farmers' perceptions of their position prior and after management transfer remained obscured in both IMT programs. This study investigates the IMT policy channeling from the national down to the field level, using the seven technical irrigation systems in Kulon Progo district, Yogyakarta province, as the research context for IMT implementation. It started at the national level, looking at the way IMT policy characteristics under WATSAL were shaped by the policy elites' perceptions and interests under the WATSAL Task Force (WTF). Later, when the struggle over the principles of IMT occurred in September 2003, this thesis focuses on studying strategies and manouvres used by the policy actors from the different central government ministries to influence the decision making process at the parliament. These central government ministries are the National Development Planning Agency (NDPA), the Ministry of Settlement and Regional Infrastructure (Kimpraswil), and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA). From the national level, this study moves further down to regional level, before it analyzes the actual implementation of IMT in the seven irrigation systems in Kulon Progo district, from inter-system level down to farmers' fields. This thesis consists of nine chapters. After the introduction, chapter 2 started with the discussion of the changing characteristics of the Indonesian state. Following the fall of Suharto's government and the political reform in 1998, the concept of regional autonomy was introduced and widely applied. In practice, <b>regional</b> autonomy was <b>handicapped</b> by inoperative fiscal decentralization. Despite their decision making authority to direct the regional development, regional governments remained dependent on fund disbursement from the central government. The central government's domination in the country's development was evident from the preservation of 'project approach' as the only structure to channel policy program from the national down to the field level. Adopted in the late 1960 s, the project approach continued to serve as the country's development engine in the post Suharto Indonesia. The way IMT policy was implemented relying on project structure and mechanisms linked the organizational functioning of the Federations of Water Users Associations (FWUAs) to the bureaucratic mechanisms and procedures within the government agency. Chapter 3 discusses how the irrigation agency's bureaucratic identity contradicts with the idea of management transfer and thus how the first assumption in IMT flaws. As IMT policy embodied the shift from infrastructure-oriented to farmer-focused irrigation development, this contradicts with the irrigation agency's interests and organizational foundation in construction and rehabilitation activities. Unlike what is assumed by the international policy makers, the irrigation agency perceived IMT as a threat that could endanger their bureaucratic position and decision making authority in the sector's development. Despite the abolition of the Ministry of Public Works (MPW) in 1999, the bureaucratic identity of the irrigation agency remained unchanged. This was evident from the way the core policy actors in the agency continued to direct the agency's organizational development following the construction-based approach. Following the abolition of the MPW, the core policy actors defended their bureaucratic position with the formation of the State Ministry of Public Works (Meneg PU) next to the newly formed Ministry of Settlement and Regional Development (Kimbangwil). Later, the core policy actors in the irrigation agency resumed their bureaucratic power with the unification of the Meneg PU and Kimbangwil into the Ministry of Settlement and Regional Infrastructure (Kimpraswil) in 2001. Chapter 4 shows how the decision to transfer the management of government irrigation systems from the irrigation agency to farmers was neither rooted in farmers' opinion nor their capability in system management. Similarly, the idea of management transfer was not based on organizational performance and functioning of these farmer organizations. Rather, the shift from organizational to institutional approach in irrigation development was triggered by the overall dominance of the neo-liberal development approach and the extrapolation of farmers' capability as this was observed in the farmer managed irrigation system (FMIS) as the means to solve the persistent poor performance of government irrigation system. Using the evolution of IMT policy in Indonesia, this thesis illustrates how the manifestation of IMT policy as the new international policy trend in irrigation management was rooted primarily in the international donors' concern of their earlier investments in the sector's development, and thus failed to focus on the actual management problems encountered by the irrigation agency and farmers. Despite the strong focus on farmers in IMT policy, the policy formulation was based primarily on the international policy makers' perception on how farmers' role in system management could contribute to a better system performance. The way fanners perceived their own role in the overall system management remained obscured. The way the process of management transfer is shaped by continuous power struggles is illustrated in respectively chapter 5, 6, 7 and 8. In chapter 5, the way IMT policy formulation was shaped by hidden policy agenda illuminates the policy political dimension. Using the evolution of IMT from the IOMP 1987 to the 1999 WATSAL, this thesis illustrates how the idea of management transfer has always been tempered by policy elites' interests and perceptions. In both IOMP 1987 and WATSAL, IMT policy agenda was defined as the result of power struggles between the different segments within the government bureaucracy. Under IOMP 1987, the irrigation agency manoeuvred their construction-based interests by redefining and extending the scope and degree of system rehabilitation as one of the requirement for management transfer. Under WATSAL, the WATSAL Task Force hid the real implications of the Kabupaten Irrigation Improvement Fund (KIIF) concept from the irrigation agency so that they could proceed with the application of 'stimulant fund'. By shifting the access to the sectoral development funds from the agency to FWUAs, the WATSAL policy makers attempted to use the FWUAs as their grass roots weapon to counteract the irrigation agency's bureaucratic power in the sector's development. The political aspect of management transfer became more apparent from the policy struggle over the principles of IMT which occurred in 2003. Chapter 6 illustrates how the struggle began when Kimpraswil realized the real implications of IMT under WATSAL for their bureaucratic existence. Kimpraswil strategically used the to-be promulgated Water Act at that time as its legal shield to redirect the development path in the irrigation sector, towards recentralization. Despite strong attempts made by both the National Development Planning Agency (NDPA) and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MoHA) to counteract Kimpraswil's position on IMT, the WATSAL IMT program was halted following the promulgation of the new Water Act in February 2004. With the promulgation of the new Water Act in February 2004, Kimpraswil center staged its bureaucratic power and its decision making authority in directing the irrigation sector development. Kimpraswil's successful attempt to limit farmers' involvement at the tertiary level was linked to their ability to steer and direct parliament members' decision on the scope and degree of management transfer as this was incorporated in the Water Act Number 7 of 2004. As the government agency responsible for the sector's development, Kimpraswil had better access and resources to influence the parliamentary decision making process than any other government agencies. In chapter 7 and 8, the way the district irrigation agency directed the FWUAs organizational development towards their bureaucratic replica once again illuminates the irrigation agency's position on the idea of management transfer. Contradicting with the assumption that the irrigation agency was willing or could be forced to hand over the management responsibility to the FWUAs, in practice, the district irrigation agency remains pretty much interested to preserve their bureaucratic power by sustaining their role in irrigation system management. In the aftermath of the IMT policy struggle, the district irrigation agency in Kulon Progo decided to continue with the WATSAL IMT program. However, this decision was rooted in the agency's ability to steer the program implementation, {{in such a way that}} IMT sustained the agency's bureaucratic power in directing the sector's development. At district level, the way the district irrigation agency contested IMT policy was evident from the way they had directed the organizational development of the FWUAs towards bureaucratization. Like the irrigation agency, FWUA staff were more concerned with the management of the stimulant fund, and the necessary administrative and technical requirements related to the fund allocation, than ensuring farmers' actual water needs. FWUA functioning was focused on FWUA staffs ability to 'pull in' as many as possible development funds under the FWUA management. Like the irrigation agency, FWUA managed the stimulant fund in accordance to their financial interests, rather than to respond to farmers' actual needs for system repairs. IMT has extended the practice of rent-seeking to FWUAs, as FWUAs' access to the stimulant fund linked them with the cycle of bureaucratic rent-seeking in the irrigation agency. In water distribution context, IMT did not result in transferred decision making authority from the irrigation agency to the FWUAs. Even after IMT, the irrigation agency remained in charge for the inter-system level water distribution and the operation of the major irrigation infrastructure. FWUAs' role in system water distribution was limited to their ability to negotiate their water needs. FWUAs lacked any formal decision making authority to direct the system water distribution. Nevertheless, IMT reshaped the existing pattern of alliances between farmers and the irrigation agency. Unlike before, the establishment of 'spatial authority' as the result of alliances between FWUA staff and some staff in the district irrigation agency seems to diminish the centralized decision making in system management. Reacting to these new patterns of alliances, the district irrigation agency created a decision making platform to include FWUA staff in the overall water distribution arrangement at the inter-system level. The emerging patterns of alliances in water distribution formed the foundation for the establishment of polycentric decision making process in irrigation system management. The last chapter gives concluding answers on the research questions and discusses the IMT policy paradoxes. It argues that the main reasons behind the national government's partial initiative in IMT policy formulation and implementation, as well as farmers' lack of awareness of the idea of management transfer and thus their marginal involvement in the WATSAL IMT program are rooted in the IMT policy paradoxes. The first paradox concerned the way the international donors treated the irrigation agency as government agent incapable to conduct the sector's development, and at the same time as the reform agent responsible for the sectoral reform. The second paradox in IMT policy formulation concerned how international policy makers took for granted farmers' willingness to take over the irrigation system management, as proposed in the IMT policy. With reference to the above paradoxes, this thesis brings to light the multiple identities of international donor agencies in relation to their role as the trend setter in irrigation development as the area for further research. Similarly, future research on IMT policy should focus on farmers' actual role and capability in irrigation system management, and how farmers perceived their position in relation to the idea of management transfer. Finally, this thesis emphasizes the need to address the issue of bureaucratic reform within the IMT policy discourse. Apart from the irrigation agency's resistance to change, in Indonesia, the need for bureaucratic reform was recognized at both national and regional levels. The question remains on how to persuade the core policy actors in the agency that they could only sustain their bureaucratic power in the sector's development in the long term, only by allowing themselves to change and adapt to the present development needs...|$|R
