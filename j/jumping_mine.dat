5000|$|Snipe: Sniper class Blast Runners {{have the}} longest attack range of all. They can use high-caliber sniper weapons, and deploy {{automated}} sentry guns and barrier screens for protection and defense, or optical camouflage generator to hide itself, or slow down opponents by magnetizer, or tracking device {{to keep track}} with targets. As self-defense weapons, this class can carry a pistol, <b>jump</b> <b>mines,</b> sticky bombs or high vibration knives.|$|R

50|$|Charles <b>jumped</b> into <b>mining</b> again, {{but this}} time he mined for copper. With his friend, Spencer, Daniel C. Jackling, and some other men involved, the Utah Copper Company was {{organized}} in 1903. Their open pit copper mine was the richest in the country. It was this mine that made him a millionaire.|$|R

"If your suspicions <b>jump</b> with <b>mine,</b> colonel, I {{need not}} {{remind you that}} it is a matter so {{delicate}} that it would be as well if you locked it in your own breast for the present; at least, that you should not intimate to the gentleman whom you may have suspected, aught that has passed this evening." ...|$|R

60|$|Leggatt, {{who seemed}} to know the premises, had run the car into the tiny {{backyard}} where her mirror-like back almost blocked up the windows. He minded shop while we ate. Pyecroft passed him his rations through a flap in the door. The uncle ordered him in, after breakfast, to wash up, and he jumped in his gaiters at the old man's commands as he has never <b>jumped</b> to <b>mine.</b>|$|R

Upon one occasion the Minister of Mines attempted himself to <b>jump</b> a <b>mine,</b> having officially learned some flaw in its title. The total official salaries had risen in 1899 to a sum sufficient to pay 40 pounds per head to the entire male Boer population.|$|R

Yet I mean to give the truth of the thing, spite of this.|$|R

The poor boys, who were but shouting and brawling after the nature of mettled youth--the most with nought of malice--are penned up like sheep for the slaughter-- ay, and worse than sheep, for we quarter not our mutton alive, whereas these poor younglings--babes of thirteen, some of them--be indicted for high treason! Will the parents, shut in from coming to them by my Lord of Norfolk's men, ever forget their agonies, I ask your Grace?" ...|$|R
50|$|Ben Kuhl {{was from}} Michigan. In 1903, he was jailed in Marysville, California for petty larceny, and {{had also been}} sentenced to do 1 to 10 years in Oregon for horse theft. Kuhl arrived in Lander County, Nevada in 1916 and lived in a tent with two other drifters, Ed Beck and Billy McGraw. He worked as a cook at the OK Mine {{for about a month}} before he was fired for {{attempting}} to <b>jump</b> another man's <b>mining</b> claim. He was arrested for trespassing in Jarbidge.|$|R
5|$|After the disincorporation, the {{commercial}} {{center of the}} former village was revitalized by artists and entrepreneurs, who purchased and restored Main Street buildings that had fallen into disrepair. Since the 1990s, Rosendale has hosted many street festivals. The former village has {{had a number of}} notable buildings, including four churches. Two notable bridges span the Rondout Creek in the village: a road bridge that carries Route32, and the Rosendale trestle, a former railroad bridge currently being renovated as a pedestrian walkway. Joppenbergh Mountain, named after Rosendale's founder, borders the village and has been the site of numerous ski <b>jumping</b> competitions and <b>mine</b> collapses.|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} new alerts, that is, {{collections}} of structural features observed {{to result in}} toxicological activity, can be a slow process and may require significant input from toxicology and chemistry experts. A method has therefore been developed to help automate alert identification by mining descriptions of activating structural features directly from toxicity data sets. The method is based on <b>jumping</b> emerging pattern <b>mining</b> which is applied {{to a set of}} toxic and nontoxic compounds that are represented using atom pair descriptors. Using the resulting jumping emerging patterns, it is possible to cluster toxic compounds into groups defined by the presence of shared structural features and to arrange the clusters into hierarchies. The methodology has been tested on a number of data sets for Ames mutagenicity, oestrogenicity, and hERG channel inhibition end points. These tests have shown the method to be effective at clustering the data sets around minimal jumping-emerging structural patterns and finding descriptions of potentially activating structural features. Furthermore, the mined structural features {{have been shown to be}} related to some of the known alerts for all three tested end points...|$|R
