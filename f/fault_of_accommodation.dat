40|$|AbstractThe {{paper is}} devoted to the problem <b>of</b> <b>fault</b> <b>accommodation</b> in {{nonlinear}} dynamic systems related to constructing the control law which provides full decoupling with respect to fault effects. Existing conditions are formulated and calculating relations are given for the control law. The logic-dynamic approach is used to solve the problem whose features are consideration of the systems with non-smooth nonlinearities and the use of relatively simple linear methods which may be supported by existing programming systems, e. g. MatLab...|$|R
25|$|A {{new view}} is {{developing}} that the regional tectonic boundary is not under Hood Canal, {{but just to}} the west, involving the Saddle Mountain fault zone (discussed below) and associated faults. This is supported by geologically recent scarps and other signs <b>of</b> active <b>faulting</b> on the Saddle Mountain faults, and also discovery of a geophysical lineament running through Pleasant Harbor (south of Brinnon) that appears to truncate strands <b>of</b> the Seattle <b>Fault.</b> In this view Hood Canal is only a syncline (dip) between the Olympic Mountains and the Puget Lowland, and such faults as have been found there are local and discontinuous, ancillary to the main zone <b>of</b> <b>faulting</b> to the west. North <b>of</b> the Seattle <b>Fault</b> <b>accommodation</b> <b>of</b> regional movement may be along the northwest-striking Dabob Bay Fault Zone.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} fault-tolerant {{control for}} position mooring of a shuttle or floating production storage and offloading vessels. A complete framework for fault diagnosis is presented. A {{loss of a}} sub-sea mooring line buoyancy element and line breakage are given particular attention, since such failures might cause high-risk abortion of an oil-loading operation. With significant drift forces from waves, non-Gaussian elements dominate forces and the residuals designed for fault diagnosis. Hypothesis testing is designed using dedicated change detection {{for the type of}} distribution encountered. A new position recovery algorithm is proposed as a means <b>of</b> <b>fault</b> <b>accommodation</b> {{in order to keep the}} mooring system in a safe state, despite faults. The position control is shown to be capable of accommodating serious failures and preventing breakage of a mooring line, or a loss of a buoyancy element, from causing subsequent failures. Properties of the detection and fault-tolerant control algorithms are demonstrated by high fidelity simulations...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reports and}} {{demonstrates}} a computationally efficient method for machine fault detection in industrial turbine systems. Empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and Savitzky–Golay smoothing filters {{are used for}} signal denoising, with a resulting noise index being developed. By comparing the noise index with a power index (also derived in the paper), obtained from the detection of transients using a spectral analysis of the rate-of-change of unit power, three operational conditions are identifiable viz. normal operation, transient operation and operation when subject to emerging machine <b>faults.</b> The <b>accommodation</b> <b>of</b> transient operational conditions of the unit, {{so as not to}} create excessive ‘false alerts’, provides a valuable alternative to more traditional techniques, based on PCA for instance, that can only provide reliable information during steady-state operation. The efficacy of the proposed approaches is demonstrated through the use of experimental trials on sub- 15 MW gas turbines...|$|R
40|$|Any kind of {{imbalance}} {{in the operation}} of a wind turbine has adverse effect on the downstream torsional components as well as tower structure. It is crucial to detect imbalance at its very inception. The identification of the type of imbalance is also required so that appropriate measures <b>of</b> <b>fault</b> <b>accommodation</b> can be performed in the control system. In particular, it is important to distinguish between mass and aerodynamic imbalance. While the former is gradually caused by a structural anomaly (e. g. ice deposition, moisture accumulation inside blade), the latter is generally associated to a fault in the pitch control system. This paper proposes a technique for the detection and identification <b>of</b> imbalance <b>fault</b> in large scale wind turbines. Unlike most other existing method it requires only the rotor speed signal which is readily available in existing turbines. Signature frequencies have been proposed in this work to identify imbalance type based on their physical phenomenology. The performance of this technique has been evaluated by simulations using an existing benchmark model. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been confirmed by the simulation results...|$|R

MethodsOcular accommodation was stimulated with 0. 5 D steps in target vergence spanning the full range <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> for each subject. Subjective monocular amplitude <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> was measured using two clinical methods, using negative lenses and with a custom Badal optometer.

The aim {{of the present study}} was to elucidate the biophysical mechanism <b>of</b> breakdown <b>of</b> <b>accommodation,</b> which at present is unknown. Results A model of a space-clamped motor nerve fiber was developed. It was found that this new model could reproduce breakdown <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> when it included a low-threshold, rapidly activating, persistent sodium current. However, the phenomenon was not reproduced when the persistent sodium current did not have fast activation kinetics or a low activation threshold. Conclusion The present modeling study suggests that persistent, low-threshold, rapidly activating sodium currents have a key role in breakdown <b>of</b> <b>accommodation,</b> and that breakdown <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> can be used as a tool for studying persistent sodium current under normal and pathological conditions. </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of HIV and AIDS is causing an enormous public health burden. Its manifestations spare no organ. Ocular complications are mainly attributed to various opportunistic infections which are {{directly or indirectly}} caused by immune deficiency. Purpose and aim: The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the effect of HIV and AIDS on subjective amplitude <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> <b>of</b> patients under treatment with antiretrovirals and then to compare their results to those of control subjects. Methods: The study took place over a period of 10 months. A quantitative study was carried out on 58 subjects (29 ± 5. 5 years) with HIV and AIDS and 35 (28. 67 ± 4. 6 years) controls of similar age. Amplitude <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> was measured using the subjective Royal Air Force push-up method. The influence of CD 4 + cell count was also recorded. Results: People with HIV and AIDS had lower mean amplitude <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> (5. 69 ± 0. 88 D) compared to controls (8. 53 ± 1. 2 D). The decrease in amplitude <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> did not show any correlation with the CD 4 + cell count. Lower amplitude <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> exists in people living with HIV and AIDS when compared with age-related healthy people. Conclusion: The results suggest that patients with HIV and AIDS on antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) have reduced amplitude <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> and might experience presbyopia earlier in life than participants without HIV and AIDS. The reduced amplitude <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> could be the initial presentation of HIV infection before the systemic manifestation. The possible causes could be the direct neuronal infection by HIV- 1, ARVs use, pathological changes of the lens and ciliary muscle or the sensory component of the visual system. It is unknown whether the reduced amplitude <b>of</b> <b>accommodation</b> occurred prior to antiretroviral therapy or represents an ongoing injury to the eye and visual system by the HIV. </p...|$|R
