50|$|The Dublin Assay Office was {{established}} in 1637 to supervise the assaying of all gold and silver throughout the whole kingdom of Ireland. Originally, hallmarks consisted of the goldsmiths' proper mark which was the maker's mark originally used to identify the silversmith or goldsmith responsible for making the article. The <b>fineness</b> <b>mark,</b> the crowned harp, was applied to 22 carat gold and sterling silver, which was silver of a standard of 925 parts of fine silver in each 1000.|$|R
5000|$|Hallmarks {{are often}} {{confused}} with [...] "trademarks" [...] or [...] "maker's marks". A hallmark {{is not the}} mark of a manufacturer to distinguish his products from other manufacturers' products: that is the function of trademarks or makers' marks. To be a true hallmark, it must be the guarantee of an independent body or authority that the contents are as marked. Thus, a stamp of '925' by itself is not, strictly speaking, a hallmark, but is rather an unattested <b>fineness</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|R

50|$|Experts {{say that}} Strawberry Crater is {{relatively}} young {{compared to other}} craters in the United States. It was formed from volcanic eruptions around 800 and 1604 B.C. There were several volcanic periods, during which multi-colored rocks were deposited on Earth's surface. Nine-hundred-year-old Sinagua ruins in the vicinity include evidence of gardens that used volcanic cinders as a water-retaining mulch. There are many different paths leading to the crater, but {{there is only one}} trail that is <b>marked.</b> <b>Surrounding</b> the crater, there are rolling cinder-strewn hills with a variety of different plants from pinons to junipers.|$|R

50|$|Many nations require, as a {{prerequisite}} to official hallmarking, that the maker or sponsor itself marks upon the item a responsibility mark and a claim of <b>fineness.</b> Responsibility <b>marks</b> are also required in the U.S. if metal fineness is claimed, {{even though there is}} no official hallmarking scheme in that country. Nevertheless, in nations with an official hallmarking scheme, the hallmark is only applied after the item has been assayed to determine that its purity conforms not only to the standards set down by the law but also with the maker's claims as to metal content.|$|R

50|$|The {{development}} is quite complete at {{from five to}} six years. At that time {{the border of the}} incisors has been worn away a little below the level of the grinders.

At ten or eleven years, used surfaces of the teeth begin to bear a square <b>mark</b> <b>surrounded</b> by a white line, and this is pronounced on all the teeth by the twelfth year; between the twelfth and the fourteenth year this mark takes a round form.|$|R
50|$|While {{there are}} many methods of {{detecting}} fake precious metals, there are realistically only two options available for verifying the <b>marked</b> <b>fineness</b> of metal as being reasonably accurate: assaying the metal (which requires destroying it), or using X-ray fluorescence (XRF).

50|$|There is one assay {{office at}} Aradippou.The Law {{governing}} the marking {{of precious metal}} articles has been ratified by the House of Representatives in 1991, creating a new semi-Governmental Organisation, the Cyprus Organisation for the Hallmarking of precious metals. The Cyprus Assay Office (CAO) is {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Ministry of Commerce, Industry and Tourism. The Cyprus Hallmark consists of three compulsory symbols: 1. The manufacturer's mark - Consists of the initials of the manufacturer of the article surrounded by a small shield; 2. The <b>fineness</b> <b>mark</b> - The purity of the metal, in parts per thousand; 3. The official mark - the Head of Aphrodite until December 2001 and a ship as from January 2002 denotes that the article is made of Gold, and the fish that the articles is made of Silver. The manufacturer's mark must be struck on the articles by the manufacturer before its submitted to the Assay Office for Hallmarking. The manufacturer may make arrangements for the manufacture's mark to be struck by the Assay Office upon submission of the article to be struck with the approved hallmarks. The manufacturer's mark which is registered under the relevant section of the Law shall include the initial letters of the name or names of the manufacturer and shall be of such design as may be approved by the Assay Office. The standards of fineness of Gold and Silver articles that are hallmarked are for gold : 375, 585, 750 and 916 parts per thousand; for silver: 800, 830 and 925 parts per thousand; no negative tolerance is permitted on the above standards of fineness.|$|R

50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 25-26 mm. The forewings {{are white}} with the dorsal half suffused with pale fuscous, obscurely spotted with darker and a fuscous basal patch occupying {{one-fourth of the}} wing, irregularly spotted with blackish irroration, terminated on the dorsum by a ferruginous mark. There is a faint pale fuscous cloud towards the costa in the middle. The second discal stigma is represented by a triangular-crescentic blackish <b>mark,</b> <b>surrounded</b> posteriorly by a semicircle of five cloudy dots of blackish irroration, the fourth tinged with yellowish. The apical area beyond the second discal stigma is wholly suffused with light fuscous and sprinkled with blackish, crossed by a nearly straight whitish line from a triangular spot on the costa at four-fifths to the tornus. The hindwings are whitish-fuscous, becoming light fuscous posteriorly. The costa anteriorly is broadly dilated and tufted with grey and white projecting scales towards one-third, above with a long dark grey hairpencil from the base lying in a subcostal groove, clothed with whitish hairs.|$|R
50|$|Coins {{were defined}} by {{monetary}} regulations {{as so many}} minted per mark weight and of a certain minimum <b>fineness.</b> The mint <b>mark</b> used was the mark of Castile. It originated when Alfonso X (1252-1284) replaced the Roman pound (libra) with the Cologne mark. Spanish numismatists usually use the weight of this mark as determined in 1799, i.e. 230·0465 grams. The measure of fineness (ley in Spanish) for gold was 24 quilates (carats), each of 4 granos (grains); the measure for silver was 12 dineros, each of 24 granos.|$|R
50|$|In the manga Rosario + Vampire, ghouls are {{a type of}} mindless, cannibalistic {{monster that}} are created in two manners. Ordinary ghouls are created when an evil spirit {{possesses}} a corpse. Rarely, ghouls are created when a human repeatedly has monster blood injected into their veins. The monster blood grants the ghoul supernatural power {{but at the same}} time destroys the psyche, leaving them a mindless killing machine. They resemble vampires but are easily identified by the web-like <b>marking</b> <b>surrounding</b> the bite <b>mark</b> where the monster blood was injected and their complete lack of self-control. The lead male character, Tsukune Aono, eventually becomes one such ghoul due to the continuous intake of vampiric blood from Moka Akashiya. Although thanks to some intervention he was able to regain almost all of his humanity and senses by having the vampire blood sealed through a Holy Lock. Although, for a time, there's still a danger he'll revert to a ghoul again. Eventually, Tsukune overcomes the vampire blood and becomes a full-fledged vampire himself.|$|R
50|$|The CSV {{file format}} is not standardized. The basic idea of {{separating}} fields with a comma is clear, but that idea gets complicated when the field data may also contain commas or even embedded line-breaks.

Quotation does not solve everything: some fields may need embedded quotation marks, so a CSV implementation may include escape characters or escape sequences.|$|R
40|$|Thigmomorphogenesis {{is viewed}} as being a {{response}} process of acclimation to short repetitive bursts of mechanical stimulation or touch. The underlying molecular mechanisms that coordinate changes in how touch signals lead to long-term morphological changes are enigmatic. Touch responsive gene expression is rapid and transient, and no transcription factor or DNA regulatory motif {{has been reported that}} could confer a genome wide mechanical stimulus. We report here on a chromatin modifying enzyme, SDG 8 /ASHH 2, which can regulate the expression of many touch responsive genes identified in Arabidopsis. SDG 8 is required for the permissive expression of touch induced genes; and the loss of function of sdg 8 perturbs the maximum levels of induction on selected touch gene targets. SDG 8 is required to maintain permissive H 3 K 4 trimethylation <b>marks</b> <b>surrounding</b> the Arabidopsis touch-inducible gene TOUCH 3 (TCH 3), which encodes a calmodulin-like protein (CML 12). The gene neighbouring was also slightly down regulated, revealing a new target for SDG 8 mediated chromatin modification.
