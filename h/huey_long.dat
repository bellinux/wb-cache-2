5|$|Minton was {{a fierce}} {{partisan}} {{during his time}} in the Senate, and regularly abused his opponents verbally. Democratic Senator <b>Huey</b> <b>Long</b> became one of Minton's favorite targets because of Long's often-threatened filibusters. During one of the filibusters, Long threatened to join the Republican Party. After most senators had left the chamber, Minton remained for several hours to periodically taunt Long. After tiring of the taunts, Long launched a rebuttal from the podium, calling Minton a vicious politician whose positions would cost Minton re-election. The exchange was unusual for its tone and later made national news.|$|E
5|$|Twenty years later, in 1930, Governor <b>Huey</b> <b>Long</b> would {{rail against}} this loss {{when he ran}} for the office of U.S. Senator against {{incumbent}} Joseph E. Ransdell. In a circular distributed by his campaign to the citizens of New Orleans, Long listed the loss of the Mint as the very first of many complaints against Ransdell's lengthy service record in the Senate. Long {{went on to win the}} election, although he did not take office until his term as governor expired in 1932. At some point, however, the original New Orleans machinery was lost, and, at present, has not been located.|$|E

50|$|A puppet {{does not}} have to be a {{national}} ruler. For example, Oscar K. Allen was widely recognized to be <b>Huey</b> <b>Long's</b> puppet while serving as governor of Louisiana.|$|R
50|$|Elected with Allen was <b>Huey</b> <b>Long's</b> {{choice for}} {{lieutenant}} governor, John B. Fournet of Jefferson Davis Parish. Fournet actually defeated Long's younger brother, Earl Kemp Long, {{who had the}} support of most Long family members despite Huey's support for Fournet.|$|R
50|$|After Long {{was assassinated}} in 1935, Smith {{directed}} the society for a short time. He became an ally of Francis Townsend, Father Charles Coughlin and <b>Huey</b> <b>Long's</b> followers to form the Union Party.

25|$|On September 8, 1935, Weiss confronted and {{allegedly}} shot <b>Huey</b> <b>Long</b> in the Capitol {{building in}} Baton Rouge. Weiss was cornered {{and killed by}} Long's bodyguards, being shot sixty-one times. Weiss was interred at Roselawn Cemetery in Baton Rouge. In an unusual public response, thousands attended his funeral.|$|E
25|$|Perez became wealthy by subleasing state mineral lands. In 1940, {{the state}} Crime Commission {{investigated}} Perez {{at the request}} of then Governor Sam Houston Jones. In 1943, Jones sent state troopers to Plaquemines Parish to enforce his appointment of an anti-Perez parish sheriff. Perez and Jones both came out of the conservative wing of the Democratic Party, but whereas Perez had been a <b>Huey</b> <b>Long</b> backer, Jones was staunchly anti-Long.|$|E
25|$|Weiss's son, Carl Weiss, Jr., {{an infant}} {{at the time}} of his father's death, has since vigorously disputed the assertion. In a 1993 {{interview}} on the NBC program Unsolved Mysteries, he proffered the assertion that Long was accidentally shot by one of his own bodyguards. Donald Pavy, a medical doctor and relative of Judge Pavy, conducted a scientific study of the case and concluded in his book Accident and Deception: The <b>Huey</b> <b>Long</b> Shooting that Weiss did not shoot the governor.|$|E
50|$|The former {{governor}} is honored, {{along with a}} predecessor, <b>Huey</b> P. <b>Long,</b> by the <b>Huey</b> P. <b>Long</b> - O. K.

50|$|Two major candidates, Simpson and U.S. Representative Riley J. Wilson of Louisiana's 8th congressional {{district}} (Winn Parish), opposed <b>Huey</b> <b>Long's</b> election as governor.

25|$|LSU {{was hit by}} {{scandal in}} 1939 when James Monroe Smith, {{appointed}} by <b>Huey</b> <b>Long</b> as president of LSU, was charged with embezzling a half-million dollars. In the ensuing investigation, at least twenty state officials were indicted. Two committed suicide as the scandal enveloped Governor Richard W. Leche, who received a 10-year federal prison sentence {{as a result of}} a kickback scheme. Paul M. Hebert, Dean of LSU's law school at the time, then assumed interim presidency in Smith's place.|$|E
25|$|Tugwell {{then became}} {{associated}} with the Tremont & Gulf Railway Company. In time he became the treasurer and auditor of the firm. <b>Huey</b> <b>Long</b> recognized Tugwell's executive ability and created for Tugwell the office of auditor for the Louisiana Railroad Commission. The Railroad Commission, of which Long was a member prior to his election as governor in 1928, was renamed the Louisiana Public Service Commission. As auditor of the railroad commission, Tugwell installed a system of records and bookkeeping that brought him favorable comment from state organizations involved in financial matters.|$|E
25|$|During {{some of the}} Great Depression, Louisiana was led by Governor <b>Huey</b> <b>Long.</b> He {{was elected}} to office on populist appeal. His public works {{projects}} provided thousands of jobs to people in need, and he supported education and increased suffrage for poor whites, but Long was criticized for his allegedly demogogic and autocratic style. He extended patronage control through every branch of Louisiana's state government. Especially controversial were his plans for wealth redistribution in the state. Long's rule ended abruptly when the governor was assassinated in the state capitol in 1935.|$|E

25|$|During the Roosevelt administration, several radical populist {{proposals}} {{which went}} beyond what Roosevelt {{was willing to}} advocate gained in popularity. It is notable that {{all four of the}} main promoters of these proposals, Charles Coughlin, <b>Huey</b> <b>Long,</b> Francis Townsend, and Upton Sinclair, were originally strong New Deal supporters but turned against Roosevelt because they believed the New Deal programs didn't go far enough. Like the New Deal programs, these populist proposals were based entirely on single economic reforms, but did not take a position on any other issue and were therefore compatible with those holding otherwise conservative views. Some historians today believe that the primary base of support for the proposals of Coughlin, Long, Townsend, and Sinclair was conservative middle class whites who saw their economic status slipping away during the Depression.|$|E
25|$|From 1898 to 1965, {{a period}} when Louisiana had {{effectively}} disfranchised most African Americans and many poor whites by provisions of a new constitution, this was essentially a one-party state dominated by white Democrats. Elites had control in the early 20th century, before populist <b>Huey</b> <b>Long</b> came to power as governor. In multiple acts of resistance, blacks left behind the segregation, violence and oppression {{of the state and}} moved out to seek better opportunities in northern and western industrial cities during the Great Migrations of 1910–1970, markedly reducing their proportion of population in Louisiana. The franchise for whites was expanded somewhat during these decades, but blacks remained essentially disfranchised until after the Civil Rights Movement of the mid-20th century, gaining enforcement of their constitutional rights through passage by Congress of the Voting Rights Act of 1965.|$|E
25|$|On September8, 1935, <b>Huey</b> <b>Long</b> {{was assassinated}} in the State Capitol by Dr. Carl Weiss. Weiss, in turn, was gunned down shortly {{thereafter}} {{by members of the}} Louisiana State Police acting as Long's bodyguards. His alleged motivation for the attack was that his father-in-law, Judge Benjamin Pavy, was going to be gerrymandered out of office by Long. Long lingered for two days at the nearby Our Lady of the Lake Hospital before he died on September10. His body lay in state at the State Capitol where approximately 100,000peoplesome {{from as far away as}} Arkansas, Mississippi and Texaspaid their respects. On September13, Long was interred on the grounds in front of the Capitol. In 1938, the State Legislature appropriated $50,000 to replace Long's original gravemarker, a simple tombstone, with a more monumental one; two years later, a marble pedestal surmounted by a bronze statue was erected.|$|E

He also worked toward getting federal money for state highways and establishing a state welfare office. Noe thereafter returned to the state Senate and served until 1940, when he launched his own gubernatorial bid.|$|R
5000|$|Curry won {{a special}} {{election}} for the House after Daniel F. Ashford, another St. Joseph planter, died in office in 1929. Curry was chairman for part of his tenure of the Public Works, Lands, and Levee Committee, a panel of particular importance to the parishes along the Mississippi River. Originally anti-Long, {{like most of the}} planter class, Curry by his second full term had begun to vote increasingly with the Long faction that he had first opposed. Sheriff Elliot D. Coleman, who served from 1936 to 1960, was also staunchly pro-Long; indeed he had been a bodyguard at the assassination in Baton Rouge in 1935 of <b>Huey</b> Pierce <b>Long,</b> Jr., and claimed to have fired two shots at proclaimed assassin Carl Weiss. [...] The 1935-1936 state elections, with memory of <b>Huey</b> <b>Long's</b> demise fresh in the minds of voters, proved devastating to many anti-Longites. The yeoman and tenant farmers gained the voter majority over the planters and business class. Where planters remained in office they did so through their political flexibility. The particular blot to the planter came with the unseating in 1936 of U.S. Representative Riley J. Wilson, one of <b>Huey</b> <b>Long's</b> unsuccessful primary opponents in 1928.|$|R
