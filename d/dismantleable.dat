Assault Engineer {{vehicle with}} {{inflatable}} boats {{stored in the}} side storage lockers, and light <b>dismantleable</b> assault bridges stored inside through loss of a seat for more storage space. Early command vehicles for Pioneer platoons (Pionierzug) were equipped with a 37 mm Pak 36 anti-tank gun mount.|$|E

Safar is a flexible, innovative structure designed by Janak Mistry. It {{is set up}} by the actors of Janam wherever they go to perform their large proscenium plays, and is equipped with lights and a sound system. It can be used for a variety of purposes, and various kinds of spaces can be created in it. It can seat about 600-700 people.|$|E

Brightwell and Winkler introduced {{the notion of}} <b>dismantleable</b> constraint graph to characterize those H whose set Ω is connected under single vertex recolorings for every G. Given fugacities λ(c) > 0 (c ∈ VH) our focus is on sampling an ω ∈ Ω according to the Gibbs distribution, i. e., with probability proportional to ∏ λ(ω(v)). We prove, for each v∈VG <b>dismantleable</b> H, that there exist positive constant fugacities on VH such that the Glauber dynamics, a Markov chain which recolors a single vertex at each step, has mixing time O(n 2) for all bounded degree graphs G...|$|E
