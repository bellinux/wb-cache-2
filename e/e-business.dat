40|$|SMEs are {{a type of}} {{business}} that has been intensively studied with regards to many different aspects, given that they are known as the engines of economies. Also, {{the adoption of the}} e-channel by SMEs has been researched widely. Yet, scarce research exists on <b>e-businesses</b> that do not have a physical point of sale – a rather new phenomenon that has changed the business world permanently. Especially the number of SME <b>e-businesses</b> increases rapidly and this type {{of business}} has not sufficiently been researched. <b>E-businesses,</b> given their own nature, are very exposed to external factors and competition, thus they have the need to be agile to remain relevant. Furthermore, it is known that HR {{are one of the most}} important resources in every business, and weigh even more in small businesses. This study aims at researching the existing gap in academic literature on <b>e-businesses</b> by shedding light on the general structures of the businesses HRM. Moreover, the concept of business agility in the context of SME <b>e-businesses,</b> which enables the businesses to cope with a complex and ever-changing environment, and how this characteristic can be fostered through HRM, is researched by this study. This study is based on a qualitative multiple case study of seven SME <b>e-businesses</b> from Germany and Sweden. The interviews were conducted face-to-face or via Skype with the HR responsible of the companies. The general HRM structures and activities were analyzed in SME <b>e-businesses,</b> as well as their contribution to eight agility characteristics, identified by previous research in different contexts: contextual clarity, common purpose, commensurate returns, flexible organizational structures, continuous learning, autonomy and accountability, personal growth and collaboration. Furthermore, three agility characteristics that can be revealed by the workforce of a company were analyzed: proactivity, adaptability and generativity. We conclude that the general HRM structures and activities reveal characteristics of typical SMEs as well as of large <b>e-businesses.</b> Furthermore, this study found, that business agility is generally fostered through surprisingly well-formalized HRM activities. Common purpose, commensurate returns, continuous learning, collaboration and generativity are the characteristics towards business agility that are fostered the most through HRM in SME <b>e-businesses...</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{advances}} in Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and {{the advent of}} the Internet have facilitated the emergence and growth of collaborative strategies amongst small <b>e-Businesses</b> (Matlay & Westhead, 2005). In addition, during the last decade or so, team-led entrepreneurship has been identified as a highly profitable alternative to single founder entrepreneurship. Recent research suggests that growth oriented, small <b>e-Businesses</b> operating in international e-Markets {{are more likely to be}} founded and managed by teams of e-Entrepreneurs (Matlay & Westhead, 2007). In increasingly globalised and hyper-competitive markets, "virtual teams" of e-Entrepreneurs search, discover and exploit new entrepreneurial opportunities. This type of entrepreneurial team consists of geographically dispersed entrepreneurs who are led by common entrepreneurial interests and interact electronically in order to promote interdependent strategies and fulfil entrepreneurial goals. In this article, an illustrative longitudinal case study of a pan-European virtual team of 24 e-Entrepreneur members is used to evaluate emergent collaborative and competitive strategies in small <b>e-Businesses</b> that are lead and managed by members. Collaborative and competitive strategies of <b>e-Businesses</b> are identified and related outcomes are analysed.

In this paper, we propose the concept of a federated data mining system hosted by an Application Service Provider (ASP) as a means of alleviating the bottlenecks of high cost and diverse data mining needs.

40|$|This paper {{reports from}} case study-based {{research}} that investigates {{the impact of}} the transition from bricks-and-mortar to clicks-and-mortar businesses on the management of core internal business processes. It has two main aims: firstly, to identify the business models for the processes of order fulfilment and delivery used in clicks-and-mortar <b>e-businesses,</b> and any organizational and environmental factors affecting these processes; secondly, to identify the main factors involved in the adoption and use of Internet-based ICTs for e-commerce in clicks-and-mortar <b>e-businesses,</b> and any organizational and environmental factors affecting adoption and use. Results from eight UK-based companies that have been changing from traditional bricks-and-mortar companies to clicks-and-mortar <b>e-businesses</b> are reported. Five main conclusions are drawn from a cross-case analysis: (1) increased integration in e-commerce business processes is inhibited by both technological and business barriers; (2) organizations display various and often confused motives for adopting e-commerce; (3) barriers to the increased adoption of e-commerce are not just technological, but also sociological and economic; (4) the adoption of e-commerce challenges existing supply network relationships; (5) the adoption of e-commerce is tending to automate rather than redesign existing business processes. A three-pronged approach to future research work in this under-researched area is recommended. This encompasses undertaking longitudinal case study research to track e-commerce developments over time, extending the range of cases to include other industry sectors (such as not for profits), and undertaking survey research across a large number of organizations, using quantitative methods, to test the generalizability of the findings from this research.

40|$|Abstract Web sites {{allow the}} {{collection}} of vast amounts of navigational data- clickstreams of user traversals through the site. These massive data stores offer the tantalizing possibility of uncovering interesting patterns within the dataset. For <b>e-businesses,</b> always looking for an edge in the hyper-competitive online marketplace, this possibility is of particular interest. Of significant particular interest to <b>e-businesses</b> is the discovery of Critical Edge Sequences (CES), which denote frequently traversed subpaths in the catalog. CESs {{can be used to}} improve site performance and site management, increase the effectiveness of advertising on the site, and gather additional knowledge of customer interest patterns on the site. Using traditional graph-based and web mining strategies to find CESs {{could turn out to be}} expensive in both space and time. In this paper, we propose a number of approximate algorithms to compute the most popular paths bewteen node pairs in a catalog, which are then used to discover CESs. Our methods are both space-efficient and accurate, providing a vast reduction in the storage requirement with a minimum impact on accuracy. These algorithms, which can be executed off-line in batch mode, are also practical with respect to running time. As variants of single-source shortest-path, they run in log linear time.
