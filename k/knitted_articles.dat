40|$|One of {{the main}} causes of {{disabling}} deficits is neurological affections. Many times, {{the evolution of the}} condition leads to a diminution of the patient’s life quality. Functional electrical stimulation (FES) is part of the neurological rehabilitation process that comprises all the actions one can take in order to increase a patient’s integration and autonomy degree from a social and financial point of view. FES is a method based on substituting the commands that are usually transmitted by the nervous system with an electric impulse. The use of such a method on different body areas required the development of some adequate devices, starting with the stimulator itself and finishing with {{the way in which the}} stimulus is conveyed to the effectors. Textile materials that incorporate sensors and, mainly, the clothing products that have such components in their structure, have a high applicability potential; they can be used for preventing illnesses and for the rehabilitation of seniors, of people who are confined to bed, sportsmen, people who suffer from long-term illnesses, disabled people, thus diminishing the time one spends in the hospital. A possible solution for manufacturing incorporated textile electrodes consists in the insertion of some electro-conductive yarns onto textile surfaces by using a variety of technologies. The project approaches the use of knitting, a widespread textile technology. The incorporated knitted electrodes were accomplished by applying the knitting technology on single circular small diameter machines. Thus, we were able to obtain a variety of <b>knitted</b> <b>articles</b> as two-dimensional or three-dimensional tubular knitted fabric. Their dimensions, structures, and parameters correspond to the typo-dimensions of the human body and to the purpose for which the clothing product was designed. The knitted versions were tested by using a Microstim 2 v 2 (PW = 300 μs, 40 Hz) neurostimulator for which the current intensity was adjusted to approx. 30 mA...|$|E

40|$|The {{clothing}} must have, {{in addition}} to the protective function of the body, aesthetic and hygienic functions. The comfort that the clothing is providing is influenced by processes of transfer of heat and moisture. These processes are considered as processes more complex, and which take account of: production and transfers heat and the humidity of the human body and transfer them in the framework of the system your body- clothing- environment, and second, the ventilation to and from the environment by clothing. To improve the understanding on this complex topic the paper presents one of the methods to analyze the comfort parameter on the <b>knitting</b> <b>articles</b> realized from different raw material on the small diameter circular knitting machines. In the analysis processes of transfer of moisture by textile materials it is necessary to make a distinction between moisture transport in the form of vapor (molecule) and the in the liquid form (drop). The transfer of moisture by textile materials increases with the increase in permeability of the air, due to the structure of the fabric. In the purpose to analyze the type of the yarn influence on the transfer of humidity in the status of vapor through the knitted fabric, there were tested different samples knitted from 8 types of yarn...|$|R
5000|$|Already {{having been}} {{recognized}} as a well known singer and rising star, Hart appeared {{as a model for}} Ursula du Bois <b>knitting</b> <b>articles</b> in the Deseret News and The Blade in July 1966. In 1968 she starred in the Jet Set Revue at Las Vegas's Aladdin Hotel.Later that year, Hart was working in Toronto, and was spotted by Gib Kerr who was also the manager of Rich Little. A year later he had signed her on and had become her personal manager. It was reported in the Valley News October 8 edition that she had completed her first recording on the Silver Cloud label. As she had already recorded prior to this with [...] "I'll Wait" [...] bw [...] "Mama Worries" [...] as a teenaged Dian Erhardt in 1958, this recording would have been released as Dian Hart and on the Kerr Label, which was most likely named after her manager Gib Kerr.

40|$|In Scandinavia {{there is}} a saying: “There {{is no such thing}} as bad weather, only bad clothes. ” This is a {{sentiment}} one could apply to Detective Sarah Lund’s sweater, a garment so significant that it appears in the TV drama The Killing as a character in its own right. Using the language and literature of <b>knitting,</b> this <b>article</b> considers the significance of one garment in one television drama series as a means of expressing the contemporary sublime; a quest for truth and justice by a lone figure in a chaotic landscape, smothered by institutionalization. The sweater will thus be discussed as neither guise nor disguise, but representative of the internal self, externalized and as a tool for negotiating personal morality within impersonal systems of power. So, Sarah must untangle herself from the smothering sweater in order to complete her journey, and reveal both herself and the killer. Here, Sarah’s sweater is not merely knitwear, but the materialization of immorality clothed in the knitted and moral; it is a cover-up. As The Killing implies, murder is the tip of the iceberg; we all need to recognize that our knitwear is killing us...|$|R
50|$|Originally, the National Order of the Daughters of Isabella, the {{organization}} was very active during World War I, volunteering as nurses and clerks, hosting parties for servicemen, conducting sewing and knitting classes for the Red Cross, donating clothing for the needy {{and working with the}} blind. In 1921 the name was changed to the Catholic Daughters of the Americas and in 1925 the Knights of Columbus severed ties with {{the organization}}. Under the direction of Mary Duffy from 1923 to 1950 the group expanded vigorously, reaching 170,000 members in 1928. During World War II the Daughters were again active with 8,314 members serving in the Red Cross, over 72,000 completing the Red Cross courses, 7,468 members gave blood donations and 50,000 members sewed and <b>knitted</b> a million <b>articles</b> of clothing. The national organization and the courts combined purchased $5.13 million worth of war bonds and sold $3 million more.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are four}} basic types of {{knitting}} needles (also called [...] "knitting pins"). The {{first and most}} common type consists of two slender, straight sticks tapered to a point at one end, and with a knob {{at the other end}} to prevent stitches from slipping off. Such needles are usually 10-16 inches long but, due to the compressibility of knitted fabrics, may be used to knit pieces significantly wider. The most important property of needles is their diameter, which ranges from below 2 mm to 25 mm (roughly 1 inch). The diameter affects the size of stitches, which affects the gauge of the knitting and the elasticity of the fabric. Thus, a simple way to change gauge is to use different needles, which is the basis of uneven knitting. Although knitting needle diameter is often measured in millimeters, there are several different size systems, particularly those specific to the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan; a conversion table is given in the <b>knitting</b> needle <b>article.</b> Such <b>knitting</b> needles may be made out of any materials, but the most common materials are metals, wood, bamboo, and plastic. Different materials have different frictions and grip the yarn differently; slick needles such as metallic needles are useful for swift knitting, whereas rougher needles such as bamboo are less prone to dropping stitches. The knitting of new stitches occurs only at the tapered ends, and needles with lighted tips have been sold to allow knitters to knit in the dark.|$|R
60|$|There {{were still}} {{four hours of}} {{daylight}} after they had finished their meal, so they went out with Dias to explore one of the numerous burying- grounds round the village. It consisted of sunken chambers. In these were bones, with remains of the mats in which the bodies had been clothed. These wrappings resembled small sacks, and they remarked that the people must have been of very small size, or they could never have been packed away in them. With them had been buried many of the implements of their trade. One or two had apparently not been opened. Here were <b>knitting</b> utensils, toilet <b>articles,</b> implements for weaving, spools of thread, needles of bone and bronze. With {{the body of a}} girl had been placed a kind of work-box, containing the articles that she had used, and the mummy of a parrot, some beads, and fragments of an ornament of silver. Dias told them that all these tombs were made long before the coming of the Incas. He said that round the heads of the men and boys were wound the slings they had used in life, while a piece of cotton flock was wrapped round the heads of the women. Many of the graves communicated with each other by very narrow passages; the purpose of these was not clear, but probably they were made to enable the spirits of the dead to meet and hold communion with each other.|$|R
