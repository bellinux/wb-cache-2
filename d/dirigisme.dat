25|$|An {{important}} aspect of fascist economies was economic <b>dirigisme,</b> meaning an economy where the government often subsidizes favorable companies and exerts strong directive influence over investment, as opposed to having a merely regulatory role. In general, fascist economies were based on private property and private initiative, but these were contingent upon service to the state.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, technocrats such as Jean Bichelonne and {{engineers}} from the Groupe X-Crise used their position to push various state, administrative, and economic reforms. These reforms {{have been cited}} as evidence of a continuity of the French administration {{before and after the}} war. Many of these civil servants and the reforms they advocated were retained after the war. Just as the necessities of a war economy during the First World War had pushed forward state measures to reorganize the economy of France against the prevailing classical liberal theories – structures retained after the 1919 Treaty of Versailles – reforms adopted during World War II were kept and extended. Along with the 15 March 1944 Charter of the Conseil National de la Résistance (CNR), which gathered all Resistance movements under one unified political body, these reforms were a primary instrument in the establishment of post-war <b>dirigisme,</b> a kind of semi-planned economy which led to France becoming the modern social democracy it is now. An example of such continuities is the creation of the French Foundation for the Study of Human Problems by Alexis Carrel, a renowned physician who also supported eugenics. This institution was renamed as the National Institute of Demographic Studies (INED) after the war, and exists to this day. Another example is the creation of the national statistics institute, renamed INSEE after the Liberation. The reorganization and unification of the French police by René Bousquet, who created the groupes mobiles de réserve (GMR, Reserve Mobile Groups), is another example of Vichy policy reform and restructuring maintained by subsequent governments. A national paramilitary police force, the GMR was occasionally used in actions against the French Resistance, but its main purpose was to enforce Vichy authority through intimidation and repression of the civilian population. After Liberation, some of its units were merged with the Free French Army to form the Compagnies Républicaines de Sécurité (CRS, Republican Security Companies), France's main anti-riot force.|$|E
500|$|As the {{movement}} initially tended to describe {{itself as a}} social trend rather than a political party, it also attracted {{former members of the}} Conservative Party (such as Constantin Argetoianu, Constantin Garoflid, and Take Ionescu), military men such as Constantin Coandă, the Democratic Nationalist Party leader A. C. Cuza, the notorious supporters of <b>dirigisme</b> Mihail Manoilescu and Ştefan Zeletin, the moderate nationalist Duiliu Zamfirescu, the future diplomat Citta Davila, the journalist D. R. Ioaniţescu, the left-wing agrarianist Petru Groza, the Bukovinan leader Iancu Flondor, and the lawyer Petre Papacostea. Additional support came from Transylvanian activists such as Octavian Goga and Teodor Mihali, who had previously left the Romanian National Party there in protest over the policies of its president Iuliu Maniu. Nevertheless, the People's Party did attempt to approach Maniu for an alliance at various intervals after summer 1919 (according to Argetoianu, their attempts were frustrated by King Ferdinand I, whose relationship with Maniu was cordial at the time, and who allegedly stated [...] "Maniu is no one else's! Maniu is mine!").|$|E
2500|$|However, as {{a result}} of the global {{financial}} crisis that came to a head in September 2008, Sarkozy has returned to the state interventionism of his predecessors, declaring that [...] "laissez-faire capitalism is over" [...] and denouncing the [...] "dictatorship of the market". Confronted with the suggestion that he had become a socialist, he responded: [...] "Have I become socialist? Perhaps." [...] He has also pledged to create 100,000 state-subsidised jobs. This reversion to <b>dirigisme</b> is seen as an attempt to stem the growing popularity of revolutionary socialist leader Olivier Besancenot.|$|E
2500|$|The Japanese {{military}} viewed {{itself as}} [...] "politically clean" [...] {{in terms of}} corruption, and criticized political parties under a liberal democracy as self-serving and a {{threat to national security}} by their failure to provide adequate military spending or to address pressing social and economic issues. The complicity of the politicians with the zaibatsu corporate monopolies also came under criticism. The military tended to favor <b>dirigisme</b> and other forms of direct state control over industry, rather than free market capitalism, as well as greater state-sponsored social welfare to reduce the attraction of socialism and communism in Japan.|$|E
2500|$|The Soviet Union's {{last year}} of {{economic}} growth was 1989, and throughout the 1990s, recession ensued in the Former Soviet Republics. [...] In May 1998, following the 1997 crash of the East Asian economy, things began to get even worse in Russia. [...] In August 1998, {{the value of the}} ruble fell 34% and people clamored to get their money out of banks (see 1998 Russian financial crisis). [...] The government acted by dragging its feet on privatization programs. [...] Russians responded to this situation with approval by electing the more pro-dirigist and less liberal Vladimir Putin as President in 2000. [...] Putin proceeded to reassert the role of the federal government, and gave it power it had not seen since the Soviet era. [...] State-run businesses were used to out-compete some of the more wealthy rivals of Putin. [...] Putin's policies were popular with the Russian people, gaining him re-election in 2004. At the same time, the export-oriented Russian economy enjoyed considerable influx of foreign currency thanks to rising worldwide oil prices (from $15 per barrel in early 1999 to an average of $30 per barrel during Putin's first term). The early 2000s recession was avoided in Russia due to rebound in exports and, to some degree, a return to <b>dirigisme.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Prince Henry, [...] {{based in}} the city of Tomar, was the major proponent of this initiative,. As {{headquarters}} of the Order of Christ (formerly the Knights Templar), and with a large community of Jewish merchants, the city was also very connected to Lisbon by its trade in grains and nuts (one of Lisbon's main exports). The ready access to large amounts of capital and knowledge of the Orient that the Templars and the Jews had were key to achieving the objectives of the Lisbon merchants. Although Prince Henry was the driving force of this project, it was not actually of his own design, but rather had been conceived by the merchants of Lisbon. Those who supported the monarchy financially by the payment of taxes and customs tariffs, making it virtually independent of the resources of the territorial nobles, bent it to their own mercantilist purposes. Prince Henry was, however, the organiser of the state's policy of <b>dirigisme</b> (state-directed investment): the substantial risk involved and the capital needed to finance the opening of new trade routes required the cooperation of all merchants throughout the realm (just as today many large capital projects are undertaken with international cooperation). Henry organised and supervised preparations by the Portuguese merchant fleet to reach the sources of gold, ivory and slaves, efforts that the merchants themselves had managed inefficiently. Using funds made available by the Order of Christ, mariners' schools were founded to centralise the resources and practical knowledge of the merchants of Lisbon. Several expeditions were launched under contract {{to some of the most}} influential of the bourgeoisie in Lisbon, and the Gulf of Guinea was finally reached around 1460, the year Prince Henry died.|$|E
50|$|The 1981 {{election}} of president François Mitterrand saw a short-lived increase in governmental {{control of the}} economy, nationalising many industries and private banks. This form of increased <b>dirigisme,</b> was criticised as early as 1982. By 1983, the government decided to renounce <b>dirigisme</b> and start an era of rigueur ("rigour") or corporatization. As a result, the government largely retreated from economic intervention; <b>dirigisme</b> has now essentially receded, though some of its traits remain. The French economy grew and changed under government direction and planning much more than in other European countries.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dirigisme</b> flourished {{under the}} center-right governments of Charles de Gaulle and Georges Pompidou. In those times, {{the policy was}} viewed as a middle way between the American policy of little state {{involvement}} and the Soviet policy of total state control. In 1981, Socialist president François Mitterrand was elected, promising greater state enterprise in the economy; his government soon nationalised industries and banks. However, in 1983 the initial bad economic results forced the government to renounce <b>dirigisme</b> and start the era of rigueur ("rigour"). <b>Dirigisme</b> has remained out of favour with subsequent governments, though some of its traits remain.|$|E
50|$|Elements of state-directed socialist economies include: <b>dirigisme,</b> technocracy, Economic {{planning}} and State socialism.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Dirigisme</b> or dirigism (...) is an {{economic}} system where the state exerts a strong directive influence over investment. It designates a capitalist economy {{in which the state}} plays a strong directive role, as opposed to a merely regulatory one.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dirigisme</b> {{has been}} brought up as a politico-economic scheme at odds with laissez-faire {{capitalism}} {{in the context of}} French overseas holdings. Countries such as Lebanon and Syria have been influenced by this motif to varying degrees throughout the post-colonial period.|$|E
50|$|French philosopher Pierre Musso, in {{his book}} Le Sarkoberlusconisme, claims that Sarkozysm is {{comparable}} to the policies of Silvio Berlusconi in Italy: a political 'break' with the methods of the past, a common emphasis on a certain work ethic, economic liberalism with a dose of <b>dirigisme</b> (or Colbertism), and a pro-American foreign policy.|$|E

5000|$|Key {{aspects of}} the East Asian model include state control of finance, direct support for {{state-owned}} enterprises in [...] "strategic sectors" [...] of the economy or the creation of privately owned [...] "national champions", high dependence on the export market for growth, and {{a high rate of}} savings. It is similar to <b>dirigisme.</b>|$|E
50|$|France {{embarked}} on an ambitious and very successful programme of modernization under state coordination. This programme of <b>dirigisme,</b> mostly implemented by governments between 1944 and 1983, involved the state control of certain industries such as transportation, energy and telecommunications as well as various incentives for private corporations to merge or engage in certain projects.|$|E

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, Henri de Man's planisme {{influenced}} the left-wing of the Radical Party, called [...] "Young Turks" [...] (among them Pierre Mendès France). Planisme would later influence <b>dirigisme,</b> semi-planified economy, regionalism, spatial planning {{as well as}} Mendesism, [...] "left-wing Gaullism" [...] (Louis Vallon) and Socialist clubs in the 1960s (Club Jean Moulin, etc.).|$|E
50|$|Another {{example of}} this is the {{utilization}} of <b>dirigisme,</b> or government direction of the economy through non coercive means, both of which were practiced in France and Great Britain after the Second World War. Swedish public housing models were planned by the government in a similar fashion as urban planning in a project called Million Programme.|$|E

5000|$|Keynesian Economics which {{attempts}} a [...] "middle way" [...] between laissez-faire, unadulterated {{capitalism and}} state guidance and partial control of economic activity, {{such as in}} the French <b>dirigisme</b> or the policies of the Golden Age of Capitalism attempts to address such crises with the policy of having the state actively supplying the deficiencies of unaltered markets.|$|E
50|$|Economic <b>dirigisme</b> {{has been}} {{described}} as an inherent aspect of fascist economies by one author, Iván T. Berend in his book An Economic History of Twentieth-Century Europe. However, the Fascist systems created by Benito Mussolini (Italy), Francisco Franco (Spain) and Adolf Hitler (Germany) are a varied mix of elements from numerous philosophies, including: nationalism, authoritarianism, militarism, corporatism, collectivism, totalitarianism, and anti-communism.|$|E
50|$|Economic {{planning}} in socialism {{takes a different}} form than economic {{planning in}} capitalist mixed economies (such as <b>Dirigisme,</b> Central banking and Indicative planning); in the former case planning refers to production of use-value directly (planning of production), while {{in the latter case}} planning refers to the planning of capital accumulation in order to stabilize or increase the efficiency of this process.|$|E
50|$|In some cases, state {{capitalism}} {{refers to}} economic policies such as <b>dirigisme,</b> which existed in France {{during the second}} half of the 20th century; and to the present-day economies of the People's Republic of China and Singapore, where the government owns controlling shares in publicly traded companies. Some authors also define the former economies of the Eastern bloc as constituting a form of state capitalism.|$|E
5000|$|Examples of this include Henry Clay's American System, French <b>Dirigisme,</b> Japan's use of MITI to [...] "pick {{winners and}} losers", Malaysia's {{imposition}} of currency controls {{in the wake}} of the 1997 currency crisis, China's controlled exchange of the yuan, Argentina's economic policy of tariffs and devaluation {{in the wake of}} the 2001 financial crisis and the United States' use of tariffs to protect domestic steel production.|$|E
5000|$|The {{economies of}} the East Asian tigers are {{sometimes}} characterised as being [...] "dirigiste" [...] due to the strong {{role played by the}} state in development planning and guiding investment.. <b>Dirigisme</b> is also seen in India, State has complete control and ownership in Railways, majority control and stake in banking, insurance, electricity and oil and gas industries and has substantial control over telecommunication, port and shipping industries.|$|E
50|$|A {{mixed economy}} is a largely market-based economy {{consisting}} of {{both private and public}} ownership of the means of production and economic interventionism through macroeconomic policies intended to correct market failures, reduce unemployment and keep inflation low. The degree of intervention in markets varies among different countries. Some mixed economies, such as France under <b>dirigisme,</b> also featured a degree of indirect economic planning over a largely capitalist-based economy.|$|E
50|$|This {{method of}} {{economic}} planning originated in France after the Second World War and {{was carried out}} by the Commission General du Plan. The underlying concept behind indicative planning is the early identification of oversupply, bottlenecks and shortages so that state investment behavior can be modified in a timely fashion to reduce the incidence of market disequilibrium, with the goal being a concerted economy. Indicative planning was one aspect of <b>dirigisme.</b>|$|E
50|$|When the Socialist Party was {{in power}} in France in the post-war period, some {{commentators}} claimed that France was a socialist country, although, as {{in the rest of}} Europe, the laws of capitalism still operated fully and private enterprises dominated the economy. In the 1980s, the Mitterrand government aimed to expand <b>dirigisme</b> and scheduled to nationalize all banks but this attempt faced opposition of the European Economic Community.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Dirigisme</b> is an {{economic}} policy initiated under Charles de Gaulle of France designating an economy where the government exerts strong directive influence. It involved state control of {{a minority of the}} industry, such as transportation, energy and telecommunication infrastructures, as well as various incentives for private corporations to merge or engage in certain projects. Under its influence France experienced what is called [...] "Thirty Glorious Years" [...] of profound economic growth.|$|E
50|$|Post-war French governments, from {{whichever}} political side, generally sought rational, efficient economic development, {{with the}} long-term goal of matching the highly developed and technologically advanced {{economy of the}} United States. The development of French <b>dirigisme</b> coincided {{with the development of}} meritocratic technocracy: the École Nationale d'Administration supplied the state with high-level administrators, while leadership positions in industry were staffed with Corps of Mines state engineers and other personnel trained at the École Polytechnique.|$|E
