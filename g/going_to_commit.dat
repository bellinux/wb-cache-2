500|$|During {{the first}} {{assembly}} cut, Cameron altered the planned ending, which had given resolution to Brock Lovett's story. In {{the original version}} of the ending, Brock and Lizzy see the elderly Rose at {{the stern of the}} boat and fear she is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> suicide. Rose then reveals that she had the [...] "Heart of the Ocean" [...] diamond all along but never sold it, in order to live on her own without Cal's money. She tells Brock that life is priceless and throws the diamond into the ocean, after allowing him to hold it. After accepting that treasure is worthless, Brock laughs at his stupidity. Rose then goes back to her cabin to sleep, whereupon the film ends {{in the same way as}} the final version. In the editing room, Cameron decided that by this point, the audience would no longer be interested in Brock Lovett and cut the resolution to his story, so that Rose is alone when she drops the diamond. He also did not want to disrupt the audience's melancholy after the Titanic sinking.|$|E
500|$|The {{release of}} Paige's first full studio album of new {{recordings}} in 12years was marked in 2006, titled Essential Musicals. The album included popular songs from musicals identified by a poll on her radio show, in which 400,000 listeners voted. At this point, Paige had recorded 20 solo albums in total, of which eight were consecutively certified gold and another four multi-platinum, {{and she had}} been featured on seven cast albums. Paige also appeared in concert in Scandinavia, Hong Kong, Europe, the Middle East, New Zealand, Australia and Singapore. On 20 and 21 December 2006, she performed in concert in Shanghai, extending her concert tour to two dates to satisfy demand. With a noticeable absence from musical theatre, having not taken a role for many years, she explained in 2006 that [...] "there's been nothing that I've wanted to do, and if you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> to a year at the theatre, six days a week, and have no life, then it's got to be something that {{you want to do with}} all your heart". [...] She also affirmed that she believes for older actors it becomes harder to obtain theatre roles.|$|E
5000|$|There {{have been}} differing {{opinions}} over {{the ending of}} the film in which Laeddis asks Dr. Sheehan, [...] "Which would be worse - to live as a monster, or to die as a good man?", a line that does not appear in the book. Professor James Gilligan of New York University was Scorsese's psychiatric adviser, and he said that Laeddis' last words mean: [...] "I feel too guilty to go on living. I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> actually <b>commit</b> suicide, but I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> vicariously <b>commit</b> suicide by handing myself over to these people who're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> lobotomize me." [...] Dennis Lehane however said, [...] "Personally, I think he has a momentary flash.… It's just one moment of sanity mixed {{in the midst of all}} the other delusions." ...|$|R

Upon her arrival she realizes all the injuries he has suffered since she saw him last, including the missing testicle. As they are reconciling he realizes that Arlene and his parents are gone and he knows they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> suicide again with her help, so he tracks them down in an attempt to stop them which he successfully does, but not without facing a bit more injury.|$|R
2500|$|Casolaro's family {{argued that}} he had been murdered; that before he left for Martinsburg, he had {{apparently}} told his brother {{that he had been}} frequently receiving harassing phone calls late at night; that some of them were threatening; and that if something were to happen to him while in Martinsburg, it would not be an accident. They also cited his well-known squeamishness and fear of blood tests, and stated they found it incomprehensible that if he were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> suicide, he would do so by cutting his wrists a dozen times [...] A number of law-enforcement officials also argued that his death deserved further scrutiny, and his notes were passed by his family to ABC News and Time Magazine, both of which investigated the case, but no evidence of murder was ever found.|$|E

[...] He had wooed Lætitia Grinder, the daughter of a prosperous grocer. [...] Her father, Mr. Grinder, disapproved of their relationship, but Carboy, an apothecary (pharmacist), was able to communicate with her [...] "in prescriptions." [...] But one day, the labels for a dose of peppermint for Lætitia and a lotion for her father's back were mixed up. [...] Carboy, believing that he has killed his love, has despaired of all hope.

Thorpe was charged on 4 August 1978, resulting in a legal case that made Carman a household name.|$|R

5000|$|The {{ending of}} the film was changed from the book. Morris West said:Structurally {{speaking}} I've always thought The Shoes of the Fisherman {{was one of my}} weaker books. It wanders too much. The script for the film is tighter, more direct and I think it says in a stronger way part of what I wanted to say in the novel. We've come to a point in history where men - black or white, Marxist or capitalist, christian or non christian - are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have to make a choice. They're either <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> themselves <b>to</b> an act of love for each other or an act of hate for each other. Men on each side have to say: [...] "Look we're all brothers. Why do we kill each other in the streets? Don't lets drop the atomic bomb. Let's talk for one hour more." [...] Today this is the real triumph of good over evil. It's what i've tried to put into the last speech for the film.|$|R

40|$|In {{database}} replication, primary-copy systems {{sort out}} easily {{the problem of}} keeping replicate data consistent by allowing only updates at the primary copy. While this kind of systems are very efficient with workloads dominated by read-only transactions, the update-everywhere approach is more suitable for heavy update loads. However, this approach adds a significant overload when working with readonly transactions. We propose a new database replication paradigm, halfway between primary-copy and update-everywhere approaches, which permits improving system performance adapting its configuration to the workload, thanks to a deterministic database replication protocol which ensures that broadcast writesets are always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>committed...</b>|$|R

50|$|A {{mens rea}} is {{required}} {{even when it}} is not required for the principal offender (for example, when the principal commits a strict liability offence). The defendant must intend to do the acts which he knows will assist or encourage the principal <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> a crime of a certain type. In R v Bainbridge (1960) 1 QB 129 the defendant supplied cutting equipment not knowing exactly what crime was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>committed,</b> but was convicted because the equipment supplied was not used in the ordinary way, but for a criminal purpose instead. The accomplice must also know of all the essential matters that make the act a crime, but need not know that the act would amount to a crime because ignorantia juris non excusat. In National Coal Board v Gamble (1959) 1 QB 11 the operator of a weighbridge was indifferent as to whether the principal committed the offence which is generally not a sufficient mens rea, but the NCB was convicted because the act of the employee was an act of sale (see vicarious liability).|$|R
50|$|The Fleischers {{produced}} nine classic cartoons in the Superman series before Paramount {{took over}} the Fleischer Studios facility in Miami and ousted Max and Dave Fleischer. By the end of 1941, the brothers were {{no longer able to}} cooperate with each other, and the studio's co-owner Dave Fleischer had left Florida for California, where he would eventually become the new head of Columbia Pictures' Screen Gems studio. After the Fleischers were removed from the company, Paramount renamed the organization Famous Studios, placing Seymour Kneitel, Isadore Sparber, Sam Buchwald, and Dan Gordon in charge of production. The sleek look of the series continued, but there was a noticeable change in the storylines of the later shorts of the series. The first nine cartoons had more of a science fiction aspect to them, as they involved the Man of Steel fighting robots, giant dinosaurs, meteors from outer space, and other perils. The later eight cartoons in the series, which were all Famous Studios productions, dealt more with World War II propaganda stories, such as in Eleventh Hour, which finds Superman <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Japan <b>to</b> <b>commit</b> acts of sabotage {{in order to reduce the}} morale of the enemy; meanwhile, an angered Adolf Hitler had a cameo role at the end of Jungle Drums after Superman foiled another Nazi plot.|$|R
40|$|Jean-Paul Sartre once {{remarked that}} the writer—the philosopher included—must occupy {{herself with the}} problem of the {{relation}} between means and ends, or to put it another way, {{with the problem of}} the relation between ethics and politics. My aim in this dissertation is to describe and at least partially resolve certain means-end challenges that emerge with great importance in Sartre 2 ̆ 7 s humanistic philosophy. After offering a sympathetic account of Sartre 2 ̆ 7 s brand of humanism, I argue for a moral orientation that privileges the authority and interests of the dehumanized. This moral orientation shapes the sociopolitical ends worth struggling for. I then investigate problems related to political authority, revolutionary violence, and our arrangements with animals insofar as we must grapple with them as means {{to the end of a}} more humane world. In all three of the aforementioned problems, I argue that the Sartrean humanist must be open to morally uncomfortable means if we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>committed</b> <b>to</b> the moral project of struggling against powerlessness and hence dehumanizing sociopolitical conditions. ...|$|R
