5|$|The terrace {{comprises}} three {{one story}} cottages, a six room cottage for the principal keeper and two three room cottages for the assistants, all {{sharing the same}} roof. Each of the cottages had a kitchen, a storeroom and a privy. The building was constructed of the same imported sandstone as the lighthouse, dressed outside and plastered inside. The roof was originally made of slate, replaced in 1901 with terracotta, with five chimneys along the ridge and a bay window and gables along the front. A low terrace was built at the rear <b>from</b> <b>random</b> stone. Photographs from the 1950s also show a rear addition with a skillion roof infilling part of the verandah.|$|E

25|$|Randomness is {{most often}} used in {{statistics}} to signify well-defined statistical properties. Monte Carlo methods, which rely on random input (such as <b>from</b> <b>random</b> number generators or pseudorandom number generators), are important techniques in science, as, for instance, in computational science. By analogy, quasi-Monte Carlo methods use quasirandom number generators.|$|E

25|$|The {{species is}} only {{partially}} able to self-pollinate because of dichogamy in its flowering. This limitation, {{added to the}} long juvenile period, makes the species difficult to breed. Most cultivars are propagated by grafting, having originated <b>from</b> <b>random</b> seedling plants or minor mutations derived from cultivars. Modern breeding programs tend to use isolation plots where the chances of cross-pollination are reduced. That {{is the case for}} programs at the University of California, Riverside, as well as the Volcani Centre and the Instituto de Investigaciones Agropecuarias in Chile.|$|E
25|$|Interleaving is used {{to convert}} {{convolutional}} codes <b>from</b> <b>random</b> error correctors to burst error correctors. The basic idea behind the use of interleaved codes is to jumble symbols at the receiver. This leads to randomization of bursts of received errors which are closely located and we can then apply the analysis for random channel. Thus, the main function performed by the interleaver at transmitter is to alter the input symbol sequence. At the receiver, the deinterleaver will alter the received sequence to get back the original unaltered sequence at the transmitter.|$|E
25|$|Los Alamos has {{a history}} of {{pioneering}} research in gamma ray bursts. In 1973 the Vela satellite, which was built by Los Alamos to monitor atmospheric nuclear tests, recorded brief bursts of gamma-rays of cosmic origin coming <b>from</b> <b>random</b> directions on the sky. Today, theories abound on what causes the bursts and where they come from, but they remain a mysterious astronomical phenomena which is the subject of much research. The REACT telescope was the first gamma-ray telescope built at Fenton Hill. It received funding in July 1996 and was completed in 1998.|$|E

25|$|Models of {{characters}} are puppets. Gerry Anderson created {{a series of}} shows using puppets living in a universe of models and miniature sets, notably Thunderbirds. ALF depicted an alien living in a family, while Farscape included two puppets as regular characters. In Stargate SG-1, the Asgard characters are puppets in scenes where they are sitting, standing, or lying down. In Mystery Science Theater 3000, the characters of Crow T. Robot and Tom Servo, two of the show's main (and most iconic) characters, are puppets constructed <b>from</b> <b>random</b> household items.|$|E
25|$|Experimental {{researchers}} typically use {{a statistical}} hypothesis testing model which involves making predictions before conducting the experiment, then assessing {{how well the}} data supports the predictions. (These predictions may originate from a more abstract scientific hypothesis about how the phenomenon under study actually works.) Analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistical techniques are used to distinguish unique results of the experiment from the null hypothesis that variations result <b>from</b> <b>random</b> fluctuations in data. In psychology, the widely usd standard ascribes statistical significance to results which have less than 5% probability of being explained by random variation.|$|E
25|$|Older games often {{separated}} combat {{into its}} own mode of gameplay, distinct from exploring the game world. More recent games tend to maintain a consistent perspective for exploration and combat. Some games, especially earlier video games, generate battles <b>from</b> <b>random</b> encounters; more modern RPGs {{are more likely to}} have persistent wandering monsters that move about the game world independently of the player. Most RPGs also use stationary boss monsters in key positions, and automatically trigger battles with them when the PCs enter these locations or perform certain actions. Combat options typically involve positioning characters, selecting which enemy to attack, and exercising special skills such as casting spells.|$|E

25|$|During World War II, the Dutch heroine Hannie Schaft {{worked for}} a Dutch {{resistance}} group; she was captured by the Germans and executed just {{before the end of}} the war in 1945. Despite her efforts and those of her colleagues and private families such as the Ten Booms, most Haarlem Jews were deported, the Haarlem Synagogue was demolished and the Jewish hospital was annexed by the St. Elisabeth Gasthuis. Several Haarlem families, whether they were politically active in the NSB or not, suffered <b>from</b> <b>random</b> attacks, as the Haarlem writer Harry Mulisch described in his book De Aanslag. Haarlemmers survived during the Hunger Winter by eating tulip bulbs stored in sheds in the sandy fields around the city.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the decline}} of Jeffers' {{popularity}} was due to his staunch opposition to the United States' entering World War II. In fact, his book The Double Axe and Other Poems (1948), a volume of poems that was largely critical of U.S. policy, came with an extremely unconventional note <b>from</b> <b>Random</b> House that the views expressed by Jeffers were not those of the publishing company. Soon after, his work was received negatively by several influential literary critics. Several particularly scathing pieces were penned by Yvor Winters, as well as by Kenneth Rexroth, who had been very positive in his earlier commentary on Jeffers' work. Jeffers would publish poetry intermittently during the 1950s but his poetry never again attained the same degree of popularity that it had in the 1920s and the 1930s.|$|E
25|$|More than 60 years later, Bateman’s Principle has {{received}} considerable attention. Sutherland argued that males' higher variance in reproductive success may result <b>from</b> <b>random</b> mating and coincidence. Hubbell and Johnson suggested that variance in reproductive {{success can be}} greatly influenced by the time and allocations of mating. In 2005, Gowaty and Hubbell suggested that mating tendencies {{are subject to change}} depending on certain strategies. They argued that there are cases in which males can be more selective than females, whereas Bateman suggested that his paradigm would be “almost universal” among sexually reproducing species. Critics proposed that females might be more subject to sexual selection than males, but not in all circumstances. An example of a species that flouts Bateman's principle is the pseudoscorpion, Cordylochernes scorpioides. Female pseudoscorpions that mated with more than one male had higher reproductive success.|$|E
