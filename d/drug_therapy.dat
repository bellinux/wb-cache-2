5|$|Cancer {{changes over}} time, and pain {{management}} needs to reflect this. Several {{different types of}} treatment may be required as the disease progresses. Pain managers should clearly explain to the patient {{the cause of the}} pain and the various treatment possibilities, and should consider, as well as <b>drug</b> <b>therapy,</b> directly modifying the underlying disease, raising the pain threshold, interrupting, destroying or stimulating pain pathways, and suggesting lifestyle modification. The relief of psychological, social and spiritual distress is a key element in effective pain management.|$|E
5|$|About 20% of {{children}} on the ketogenic diet achieve freedom from seizures, and many are able to reduce the use of anticonvulsant drugs or eliminate them altogether. Commonly, at around two years on the diet, or {{after six months of}} being seizure-free, the diet may be gradually discontinued over two or three months. This is done by lowering the ketogenic ratio until urinary ketosis is no longer detected, and then lifting all calorie restrictions. This timing and method of discontinuation mimics that of anticonvulsant <b>drug</b> <b>therapy</b> in children, where the child has become seizure free. When the diet is required to treat certain metabolic diseases, the duration will be longer. The total diet duration is up to the treating ketogenic diet team and parents; durations up to 12 years have been studied and found beneficial.|$|E

50|$|One {{reason for}} {{ignoring}} {{sex differences in}} <b>drug</b> <b>therapies,</b> for example, is the standard of controlling for extraneous variables such as hormones.

The obvious {{problem is that we}} then have comparatively little data about how women respond to the same <b>drug</b> <b>therapies,</b> which compromises women’s health.|$|R
25|$|The {{clinical}} pharmacist's role involves {{creating a}} comprehensive <b>drug</b> <b>therapy</b> plan for patient-specific problems, identifying goals of therapy, and reviewing all prescribed medications prior to dispensing and administration to the patient. The review process often involves {{an evaluation of}} the appropriateness of the <b>drug</b> <b>therapy</b> (e.g., drug choice, dose, route, frequency, and duration of therapy) and its efficacy. The pharmacist must also monitor for potential drug interactions, adverse drug reactions, and assess patient drug allergies while designing and initiating a <b>drug</b> <b>therapy</b> plan.|$|E

40|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{was conducted}} on 61 treatment outcome trials for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Conditions included <b>drug</b> <b>therapies</b> (TCAs, carbamazepine, MAOIs, SSRIs, and BDZs), psychological therapies (behaviour therapy, Eye-Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR), relaxation training, hypnotherapy, and dynamic therapy), and control conditions (pill placebo, wait-list controls, supportive psychotherapies, and non-saccade EMDR control). Psychological therapies had significantly lower drop-out rates than pharmacotherapies (14 % versus 32 %), with attrition being uniformly low across all psychological therapies. In terms of symptom reduction, psychological therapies were more effective than <b>drug</b> <b>therapies,</b> and both were more effective than controls. Among the <b>drug</b> <b>therapies,</b> the SSRIs and carbamazepine had the greatest effect sizes, although the latter was based upon a single trial. Among the psychological therapies, behaviour therapy and EMDR were most effective, and generally equally so. The most effective psychological <b>therapies</b> and <b>drug</b> <b>therapies</b> were generally equally effective. Differences across treatment conditions were generally evident across symptom domains, with little matching of symptom domain to treatment type. However, SSRIs had some advantage over psychological therapies in treating depression. Follow-up results were not available for most treatments, but available data indicates that treatment effects for behaviour therapy and EMDR are maintained at 15 -week follow-up. # 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The {{diffusion}} of protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors in the US in 1996 and 1997 {{reduced the number}} of deaths attributable to HIV disease and changed {{the way we think about}} the illness. Today, HIV disease may be deemed a fairly expensive chronic condition rather than an intolerably expensive fatal illness. Although most studies have found that patients receiving new <b>drug</b> <b>therapies</b> are hospitalised less frequently than patients who received early <b>drug</b> <b>therapies,</b> it is unclear whether the {{diffusion of}} new <b>drug</b> <b>therapies</b> has increased or decreased the annual cost of care. However, it is evident that the diffusion of new <b>drug</b> <b>therapies</b> has increased the lifetime cost of care. Analysts rely on models to simulate the course and cost of HIV disease. This study reviews the evolution of these models, paying particular attention to how these models estimate the cost of care. The primary findings of this review are that the economic data used in these models are often too imprecise to accurately identify the cost of each disease stage and are almost always outdated. Moreover, it was found that estimates of drug costs in these models may not accurately reflect actual expenditures.
