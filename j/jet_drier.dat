40|$|In {{designing}} {{an energy}} efficient impinging jet dryer, {{it is essential}} to match the energy demand for drying with the supply of heat by convection to avoid overheating and energy wastage. One way to achieve this is by intermittently supply heat to the drying chamber. By using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach, this study numerically investigates the possibility of energy saving by intermittency. First, inlet temperature intermittency is applied. This is conducted by alternately raise it to drying temperature and lowers it to the ambient temperature at certain period. Second, inlet velocity intermittency is applied which is conducted by alternately supplying the hot air to the several drying chamber. One, two, three and four chamber configurations are evaluated. In addition, the intermittency period of 10, 20 and 30 min were examined. The results reveal that the steady impinging <b>jet</b> offers faster <b>drying</b> rate as compared to intermittent impinging <b>jet</b> <b>drying</b> under the same inlet conditions. In addition it was found that drying rate goes down as the number of drying chamber increases. However, the intermittent impinging <b>jet</b> <b>drying</b> offers advantages in term of temperature uniformity and energy conservation. For the same energy usage, the production rate of single drying configuration is only one fourth of the four chamber configuration. This indicates the potential of multi chamber configuration in a real drying application...|$|R

The effects of different matrix compositions on the release behaviour of a model drug were conducted by spray drying an aqueous polymeric dispersion of a neutral copolymer based on ethyl acrylate and methyl methacrylate (Eudragit (R) NE) as the main encapsulating matrix. Lactose and silica nanoparticles were used as additives to modify the matrix compositions, with vitamin B- 12 as the model drug. Evaporation-induced self-assembly of a model drug (vitamin B- 12) and the matrix materials due to their colloidal interactions produced microparticles with specific morphologies for immediate or prolonged releases. Having lactose distributed homogeneously in the matrix resulted in significantly faster and almost complete release due to enhanced swelling of the polymeric matrix with the dissolution of lactose.

To this direction, this study deals with the techno-economic design and life cycle assessment (LCA) of biojet fuel (farnesane) production from bagasse. Bagasse is the solid residue of sugar industries and its utilization within the biorefinery concept can positively contribute to the sustainable production of fuels. To this end, the present research proposes the production of farnesane from bagasse rather than edible feedstocks (e. g. sugarcane). Mass and energy balances were executed in SuperPro Designer software. The resultant mass yield was equal to 0. 121 kg (<b>jet</b> fuel) /kg (<b>dry</b> bagasse) and an energy efficiency of 26. 5 % can be realized. Economic analysis suggested a gate price of 2. 78 $/L. Cradle to grave GHG emissions reductions comparative to fossil jet fuel can be approximately 47 %. Overall, the current sustainability analysis explores potential economics and environmental benefits for the lignocellulosic sugars pathway to biojet fuel...|$|R
40|$|International audienceOn 24 March 2007, an {{extraordinary}} dust plume {{was observed in}} the Central European troposphere. Satellite observations revealed its origins in a dust storm in Southern Ukraine, where large amounts of soil were resuspended from dried-out farmlands at wind gusts up to 30 m s ? 1. Along the pathway of the plume, maximum particulate matter (PM 10) mass concentrations between 200 and 1400 ?g m ? 3 occurred in Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Poland, and Germany. Over Germany, the dust plume was characterised by a volume extinction coefficient up to 400 Mm ? 1 and a particle optical depth of 0. 71 at wavelength 0. 532 ?m. In-situ size distribution measurements {{as well as the}} wavelength dependence of light extinction from lidar and Sun photometer measurements confirmed the presence of a coarse particle mode with diameters around 2 ? 3 ?m. Chemical particle analyses suggested a fraction of 75 % crustal material in daily average PM 10 and up to 85 % in the coarser fraction PM 10 ? 2. 5. Based on the particle characteristics as well as a lack of increased CO and CO 2 levels, a significant impact of biomass burning was ruled out. The reasons for the high particle concentrations in the dust plume were twofold: First, dust was transported very rapidly into Central Europe in a boundary layer <b>jet</b> under <b>dry</b> conditions. Second, the dust plume was confined to a relatively stable boundary layer of 1. 4 ? 1. 8 km height, and could therefore neither expand nor dilute efficiently. Our findings illustrate the capacity of combined in situ and remote sensing measurements to characterise large-scale dust plumes with a variety of aerosol parameters. Although such plumes from Southern Eurasia seem to occur rather infrequently in Central Europe, its unexpected features highlights the need to improve the description of dust emission, transport and transformation processes needs, particularly when facing the possible effects of further anthropogenic desertification and climate change...|$|R
