30|$|Power {{distance}} (PDI) is {{the expectation}} of and compliance with unequal power distribution. This dimension expresses {{the degree to which}} the less powerful members of a society accept and expect that power is distributed unequally. Higher power distance nations accept that a hierarchy exists between superiors and subordinates (Carl et al. 2004). Javidan et al. (2006) argue that nations which score higher on this cultural dimension are more hierarchically structured, and those in positions of authority expect and receive obedience. Thus, we consider that companies in the nations which rate higher in power distance display a lack of equal opportunities for minorities and women, and a lack of personal or professional development within organizations. In addition, in high power distance oriented nations, power and decision making is centralised and companies place more emphasis on formal methods of <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> external <b>information</b> (Flynn <b>and</b> Saladin 2006).|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim {{of public}} service {{departments}} in South Africa is to improve service delivery through the transformation and improvement of human resources and the improvement of service delivery practices. Furthermore, {{it is important for}} the public service sector in South Africa to improve the quality of its service delivery, not only by comparing its performance with other sectors within South Africa but also by positioning itself amongst the best in the world. This can be achieved by benchmarking with other global industries and by implementing the most recent competitive intelligence strategies, tools and techniques. The environment of the public service organisations consists of competitive forces that impact the functioning of these organisations. OBJECTIVES: This article focuses on proposing competitive intelligence-related strategies, tools and techniques for <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>information</b> in the public service departments in South Africa in order to enhance service delivery. METHOD: The study was qualitative in nature and was divided into two components, namely, (1) theoretical – through an extensive review of the literature and (2) empirical – an ethnographic study at the chosen public service department, the Department of Home Affairs (DHA). Ethnographic interviews with management-level staff, focus groups and document analysis were used to obtain adequate information to determine the current state {{of public service}} delivery in South Africa. RESULTS: The results of the study was the development of a new competitive intelligencerelated framework for <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>information,</b> and it represents a formal and systematic process of informing managers in public service departments about critical issues that these departments face or are likely to experience in future. CONCLUSION: The strategic planning tools and techniques of this framework will fill the gap that exists in public service departments. Once this framework has been implemented, it could assist these departments to improve service delivery to its citizens. [URL]...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to uncover the {{principal}} obstacles preventing small business owner managers from making sound strategic financial management decisions. These obstacles are generally related to the owner managers ’ reluctance to follow accepted theoretical norms (steps) in terms of information search and analysis. This reluctance is attributable to the decision makers ’ significant lack of knowledge and experience. Data gathered with a structured questionnaire was based on a sample of 143 small business owner managers registered with SEDA (Small Enterprise Development Agency) in South Africa. The results point to an absence of a proper theoretical framework for <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>information</b> necessary for effective decision making. This framework commonly entails elements such as experience and techniques acquired from time spent in business and business intuition. Recommendations are made to assist small business owner managers to improve on their strategic decision making and resource allocation processes...|$|E

40|$|Communicative, or collaborative, {{planning}} {{has received}} a lot of attention recently. Many planners today agree that planning should be a process of facilitating community collaboration for consensus-building. As a consequence, it seems that communicative rationality is becoming more important in modern planning than the conventional instrumental rationality, whose professional approaches are often criticised as being technocratic. In this paper we address the question whether communicative planning is a better framework for protecting values and reaching objectives that have justified planning interventions to this point in society. By using notions of quality and ethics as a framework, we evaluate critically the communicative features of Dutch infrastructure planning. A distinction is made between comments about planning outcomes and comments about consensus-building processes. It is argued that communicative planning could conflict with basic ethical principles of conventional planning. It is concluded that the communicative ideology alone does not meet conventional ethical planning principles any better. This is in line with the ideas of Kaiser et al and other authors that communicative planning must go together with `adaptive' rational planning. Planning discourse should be based on planning intelligence, which consists of <b>gathering,</b> organising, <b>analysing,</b> <b>and</b> disseminating <b>information</b> to stakeholders in the use and development of land. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis argues {{the need}} to {{reinforce}} the legal basis for environmental protection in Antarctica through {{an analysis of the}} provisions contained in the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. An alternative to overcome the current deficiencies of the Protocol is provided through evidenced based information documenting the spatial dimension of the issues at stake. The relevance of using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) for <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> such <b>information</b> is demonstrated through a case study which provides a methodology for implementing the criteria listed in the Protocol with respect to protected areas designation. The aim of the research is to integrate the analytical methods of several academic disciplines, namely international environmental law, political science, environmental studies and geographical information systems technology, in order to address the issues associated with the implementation of the Protocol on Environmental Protection to the Antarctic Treaty. The first part of the thesis <b>analyses</b> the legal <b>and</b> political obstacles to a standardised implementation of the Protocol along with the weaknesses contained in some of the provisions of the Protocol. The key role of the Committee for Environmental Protection (CEP) in the implementation process is emphasised in parallel with that of the Scientific Committee and the Commission of the Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources (CCAMLR). CCAMLR is analysed as an institutional precedent within the Antarctic Treaty System (ATS) and {{as a model for the}} institutionalisation of the CEP. The second part of this thesis analyses the potential relevance of decision support tools such as GIS to the operation of the CEP. The analysis emphasises the use of GIS for developing the new protected area system detailed in Annex V of the Protocol. It relies upon precedents within International and Antarctic Organisations which have recently adopted GIS technology for environmental management purposes. The third part of this thesis develops a methodology for interpreting and applying criteria for the designation of protected areas listed in Annex V. This methodology focuses upon the use of GIS applied to a case study area, the Windmill Islands, East Antarctica, where fieldwork was undertaken during the summer 1995 - 1996. The case study casts light upon the potential of GIS techniques for the implementation of the provisions of the Protocol. The thesis concludes that the current provisions of the Protocol are insufficient to ensure its standardised implementation throughout Antarctica. The concluding part outlines the benefits of the GIS methodology developed in the case study and advocates its implementation within the institutional context detailed in this thesis, wherein the CEP would play a central role. Recommendations are formulated in which the limitations of the case study outcomes are noted, as are the improvements needed for GIS's full potential for environmental management purposes to be realised...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) -University of Natal, 2003. Today, {{the only}} {{certainty}} is uncertainty. The {{rate of change}} is continuing on a steep curve upward, information is growing in volume constantly, and {{the complexity of the}} marketplace is increasing exponentially. In order to survive, decision-makers need to anticipate and accommodate developments in the world outside, to sustain and exceed their core competitive advantage. The question is how do they go about doing this? The answer lies in competitive intelligence! Competitive Intelligence is a systematic process involving planning, <b>gathering,</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>and</b> disseminating <b>information</b> on external environment for opportunities or developments that have the potential to affect a company's competitive situation. Research reveals that competitive intelligence (Cl) has evolved from an informal into a formal discipline. While many still confuse it with just being competitor information, it has proven to expand much further into a meaningful and value-added input in the strategic decision-making process. Decisionmakers need to be equipped with the proper tools before they start the strategic planning process. The purpose of this research study is to explore the impact of competitive intelligence practices on strategic decision-making. It aims to identify the best way forward in making competitive intelligence more credible within organisations. The accelerating speed and complexity of change in the business environment places a heightened premium on timely, rigorous understanding of developing threats and opportunities. Consequently, the success of competitive advantage within organisations increasingly depends on aggressive and systematic competitive intelligence efforts to support and enable strategic decision-making. The study presents an holistic competitive intelligence framework, taking theoretical, best practices and a case study approach, enabling any organisation to successfully adapt Cl processes and structures in any given situation...|$|R

30|$|For those {{wanting to}} know the future and reduce uncertainty, pluralising {{possibilities}} can confuse and confound. Opening the future also undermines the efforts of those seeking to make particular futures appear inevitable, thereby securing their own positions through time. Therefore some caution is required when seeking to advocate and develop the use of strategic foresight in policy making. Given the role of strategic foresight to reassert {{the primacy of the}} future as a domain of the possible, strategic foresight does not claim to know the future, but understand and negotiate futures. To encompass the future as the unknown is a project fundamentally at odds with the empiricist epistemologies underlying orthodox approaches to planning and the future [29]. Better techniques for <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>information</b> are a necessary but insufficient condition for policy making. Rather than claim to know what the future is, or what the future should be, strategic foresight subverts the inevitable and envisions and educes what the future could be [30]. In this regard, strategic foresight does not just offer a different set of tools, but presents a different ontology and orientation as to how to understand the future [31 – 33].|$|E
40|$|There is {{no doubt}} that {{collecting}} and analysing information is the key element in the process of decision making. Lending decisions, taken by banks, are not exception. In order to ensure that lending decisions are serving banks' goals, the process of taking such decisions involves, inter alia, <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>information</b> about the prospective and actual clients, who are seeking loans. Such information is mainly related to the financial performance of banks' clients. The recent trend of considering information other than financial one, particularly in developed countries, seems to be basically enforced, rather than promoted, by power of the law. This can be noted in the increasing interest of banks in environmental information, while social information is still, to some extent, far from the attention of such banks. Other factors, such as religious instructions are suggested {{to play a role in}} encouraging banks to consider social information. In the case of developing countries, social and environmental information alike seems to be out of banks attention due to many factors including the absence of related laws and the weakness of desire and capacity for enforcing such laws in case of their existence.

40|$|Small and {{medium-sized}} enterprises (SMEs) in Malaysia, particularly In {{the information and}} communications technology (lCT) sector, are faced with an increasingly volatile environment. The Malaysian business scene has opened up their markets to the world where smaller businesses find themselves competing with newly launched multinational subsidiary and subdivision companies, along with the large local firms. The Malaysian Government has launched several campaigns and support for smaller local businesses to be more competitive and to continuously compete at par with these larger companies. This research project supports the Malaysian Government's objective of instilling a more structured approach towards a more competitive SME {{by focusing on the}} management of competitive information related to these companies. In recognising the rising need for competitive support, management and executives are increasingly relying on a concept called Competitive Intelligence (Cl), a systematic and ethical process for <b>gathering,</b> <b>analysing,</b> <b>and</b> managing <b>information</b> that can affect a company's plans, decisions, and operation. In managing competitive information, several companies have emerged especially to develop online tools and software that would enhance the Cl process and the value competitive intelligence brings to organisations. The success of these Cl software tools depends, however, on the sophistication of an organisation's understanding of the Cl process and scope of usage. Different companies derive different values from different approaches to competitive intelligence, and therefore require a flexible tool that is very specific to the company's needs. Therefore, this research investigated the structures and contexts of Malaysian Small and Mediumsized Enterprises (SMEs) based on competitive intelligence (Cl) concepts to derive a more customised approach to the use of Cl for SMEs in the ICT sector, {{as well as in the}} selection of appropriate Cl software. Mintzberg's approaches to <b>analysing</b> organisational structures <b>and</b> contexts, Bouthillier and Shearer's Intelligence Cycle, Herring's Key Intelligence Topics, and Davis' concept of effectiveness were used in two main stages. The first stage involved identifying the nature and range of SMEs, which exist under Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor, a government benchmarking body for local businesses. This gives an account, on the basis of cluster analysis, of a taxonomy of SME categories consisted of ten clusters. The relationships between the categories were also examined in the first stage of the research. The relationships and clusters found in the first part of the research offered the basis for the second part of the research, which constructs the criteria for evaluating online tools and software for competitive intelligence. The evaluation criteria are then used to evaluate eight Cl-ready software packages in finding suitable tools for the different categories of SMEs. Finally, the research concludes with a study of the prospective users' perceptions of effectiveness in SMEs drawn from the identified clusters. This 'multiple constituency' approach to understanding effectiveness evaluates both Davis' concept of effectiveness (usefulness), as well as the differential evaluations of perceived effectiveness. The research findings provide evidence of a range of SME structures in a variety of contexts. Levels of importance placed on different levels in the Cl process are identified, as well as aspects that need support, automation and/or augmentation. The software evaluation in the second part of the research provided ten recommendations of suitable software package(s) for each SME cluster. However, an initial review by SME managers of perceived effectiveness mostly did not reveal results that were parallel to the findings from the software evaluation study. All in all, the research confirms that SMEs can be analysed by clusters but further research would be necessary to confirm the effectiveness of using the recommended Cl software over a longer period of time.

However, school improvement scholars in developed economies now argue that schools must take their own initiative to assess {{the extent to which the}} expectations of their stakeholders ’ are met. The argument is that by systematically <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>information</b> about itself so as make value judgement, a school is likely to improve. In a country like Tanzania for instance, most schools have not embraced self-evaluation since they depend on external school inspection conducted by the inspectorate, which only targets 50 % of total school population. As it is with other developing economies, minimal inspection is blamed on inadequate resources. Implying that most schools remain unsupervised following this target. A review of relevant literature shows that despite the problem as aforementioned, the studies known to me in Tanzania, the East Africa region or indeed Africa have not explicitly empirically explored the actual self-evaluation practices {{with a view to}} ascertaining the current needs, the challenges that schools face and the possible remedies.

40|$|The main {{sources of}} {{financing}} for small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) are equity (internally generated cash), trade credit paid on time, long and short term bank credits, delayed payment on trade credit and other debt. The marginal costs of each financing instrument are driven by asymmetric information (cost of <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>information)</b> and transactions costs associated with non-payment (costs of collecting and selling collateral). According to the Pecking Order Theory, firms will choose the cheapest source in terms of cost. In {{the case of the}} static trade-off theory, firms choose finance so that the marginal costs across financing sources are all equal, thus an additional Euro of financing is obtained from all the sources whereas under the Pecking Order Theory the source is determined by how far down the Pecking Order the firm is presently located. In this paper, we argue that both of these theories miss the point that the marginal costs are dependent of the use of the funds, and the asset side of the balance sheet primarily determines the financing source for an additional Euro. An empirical analysis on a unique dataset of Portuguese SME’s confirms that the composition of the asset side of the balance sheet has an impact of the type of financing used and the Pecking Order Theory and the traditional Static Trade-off theory are rejected...|$|E

40|$|M. Comm. A {{constraint}} {{is anything}} that limits a system's performance relative to its goal. The Theory of Constraints (TOC) is a systems-management philosophy developed by Eliyahu M. Goldratt {{since the early}} 1980 's {{in a series of}} non-fiction books, articles and novels. The overall goal {{of this study is to}} understand the nature of the small business environment and the constraints it has to deal with. It is further part of this goal to determine if TOC could be made applicable in the small organisation. This goal is accomplished in the form of a literature study on the small business sector as well as on TOC. The method centres on <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>information</b> from various literature sources. TOC's fundamental message is that constraints determine the performance of any system, and any system contains only a few constraints. Constraints may be found within or outside a company. A production bottleneck, which can limit the overall profitability of a manufacturing firm, is an example of an internal constraint. An external constraint could be a lack of customer orders. TOC suggests that the goal of for -profit firms is making money, and constraints must be effectively managed if this goal is to be achieved. This is then also the goal of most small businesses, i. e. to be profitable. They need to be profitable in order to survive. The survival and growth of the small business sector is critical to the social and economic development of South Africa. Small enterprises are an integral part of a healthy economy. They increase competitiveness, contribute a great deal to job-creation and can provide long-term jobs for millions. Small businesses faces however a wide range of constraints. These constraints should be addressed in order to sustain growth in the small business sector...|$|E
40|$|M. A. Managers have an {{important}} and prominent role in an organisation. As decision-makers they hold the authority and responsibility {{to act on the}} available information. As leaders, they set examples and promote a culture of information sharing and collaboration. As strategists, they ensure that information policies are well aligned with the organisation's mission. One of the greatest challenges facing an organisation is to understand how the external environment is changing, what the changes mean, and how the organisation can best respond to the new provisos. The process of learning about the external environment is environmental scanning, i. e. the art of gathering and interpreting information about the environment enabling the organisation to have the knowledge to develop effective courses of action. The goal of information management is thus to harness information resources and information capabilities to enable the organisation to learn and adapt in an ever-changing environment. Key information processes will be assessed with reference to special problems of managing each process. At the same time the opportunity for change would be highlighted by combining an understanding of information use behaviours with a more flexible, user centred design of information services and systems. Competitive intelligence on the other hand is the systematic process of <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>information</b> about the activities of competitors and general business trends to further the organisation’s goals. All definitions point toward creating knowledge from openly available information by use of a systematic process involving planning, collection, analysis, communication and management which result in decision-maker action. While competitive intelligence incorporates knowledge management processes of collecting and storing knowledge, competitive intelligence definitions discuss the actual analysis of the gathered information. Key factors for success of information management in organisations reinforce the need for the integration of business strategy and information. The key factors are the relationships with customers and suppliers; flatter management structures and better use of resources; training and quality and environmental issues. Each of these factors rests on information, its use, creation, storage and dissemination. A process approach to information management supports the integration of business strategy and information. The calls for integration come from at least three different communities: information management, information systems and management. Successful companies are those that adapt to and shape their environments. They do so by using and creating information in a process of continuous improvement and innovation. Key factors for success in organisations reinforce the need for integration of business strategy and information. Managers in firms see their success as dependent on their organisation's ability to accommodate and manage change and to respond to changes in their environments. The study concludes with a case study of Pyromet Technologies showing {{that it is possible to}} have an integrated strategic information management model incorporating all three variables successfully...|$|E

The main subjects of the research refer to evaluations and opinions of {{children with special needs}} and their parents about the procedure of guidance, about their learning help and additional expert help, as well as to evaluations and opinions of children with special needs, their parents and their mates about their social inclusion in their school class and their school. In the theoretical part we explicate the concept and theoretical foundations of inclusion and its implementation in school environment. Further we elucidate specific dilemmas in defining children with special needs, both in view of terminology {{as well as in the}} domains of diagnosing, labelling and guidance. We focus on social skills and social inclusion of children with special needs, on participation of children and their parents in the procedures of diagnosing, planning and implementing help, as well as on activities that stimulate the process of empowerment of children with special needs. The main aims of this work were to investigate the position of children with special needs in the process of inclusive schooling, and to ascertain in what ways and how much children with special needs and their parents are involved in the procedures of diagnosing and planning expert help, as well as how they evaluate its effectiveness. The research also looked into social inclusion of children with special needs in their class and school environment. We took the sample of 249 children with special needs attending 5 th to 9 th grade at 20 primary schools in different Slovene regions; 225 parents of the children with special needs; and 6 mates of children with special needs. The data were gathered with the use of questionnaires formulated for the research, and a partly structured interview with the focus group of mates of children with special needs. In the process of <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>information</b> and in accordance with the aim of the research and the research questions, quantitative research methods were primarily employed. The overall results of the research show that children with special needs and their parents are largely included in the procedures of guidance, planning help and adaptations in schoolwork, although this is not a regular practice of all commissions for guidance and in all schools. Further, children with special needs are included in these procedures to a lesser degree than their parents. Children with special needs mainly believe that they are well integrated into their class environment, and their parents think in a similar way. However, differences in social inclusion are perceptible between different groups of children with special needs. On the basis of findings of the research we can conclude that in Slovenia, we have to devote further attention to the development of inclusive culture in schools, that is to say, equal participation of children, parents, teachers and other experts in the search for efficient strategies of helping children with special needs and, along with it, all schoolchildren in general. ...|$|E

Mintzberg's approaches to <b>analysing</b> organisational structures <b>and</b> contexts, Bouthillier and Shearer's Intelligence Cycle, Herring's Key Intelligence Topics, and Davis' concept of effectiveness were used in two main stages. The first stage involved identifying the nature and range of SMEs, which exist under Malaysia's Multimedia Super Corridor, a government benchmarking body for local businesses. This gives an account, on the basis of cluster analysis, of a taxonomy of SME categories consisted of ten clusters. The relationships between the categories were also examined in the first stage of the research. The relationships and clusters found in the first part of the research offered the basis for the second part of the research, which constructs the criteria for evaluating online tools and software for competitive intelligence. The evaluation criteria are then used to evaluate eight Cl-ready software packages in finding suitable tools for the different categories of SMEs. Finally, the research concludes with a study of the prospective users' perceptions of effectiveness in SMEs drawn from the identified clusters. This 'multiple constituency' approach to understanding effectiveness evaluates both Davis' concept of effectiveness (usefulness), as well as the differential evaluations of perceived effectiveness. The research findings provide evidence of a range of SME structures in a variety of contexts. Levels of importance placed on different levels in the Cl process are identified, as well as aspects that need support, automation and/or augmentation. The software evaluation in the second part of the research provided ten recommendations of suitable software package(s) for each SME cluster. However, an initial review by SME managers of perceived effectiveness mostly did not reveal results that were parallel to the findings from the software evaluation study. All in all, the research confirms that SMEs can be analysed by clusters but further research would be necessary to confirm the effectiveness of using the recommended Cl software over a longer period of time...|$|R
40|$|Dissertação (mestrado) - Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina, Centro de Ciencias da SaudeO estudo teve o objetivo construir um marco de referência de cuidado humano para a transformação da prática, a partir de um processo reflexivo entre a pesquisadora e um grupo de enfermeiras de unidades críticas de um {{hospital}} de ensino. Este processo foi desenvolvido em oito encontros com os temas: valores, motivação, cuidado, enfermagem, ser humano, ambiente, escolhidos pelas participantes e fundamentados em determinados fatores de cuidado de Watson (l 979, 1985). Os discursos foram analisados segundo Bardin (l 991), revelando temas que serviram de base para a elaboração do marco, constituído de conceitos e sub-conceitos: ser humano cuidador - ser cuidado, filosofia, ciência e arte do cuidar/cuidado, ambiente institucional. A partir da reflexão pode-se abstrair alternativas como: a capacitação dos cuidadores no processo interacional; a valorização e o aperfeiçoamento humano pelo reconhecimento da ciência de Enfermagem voltada à prestação de cuidados; a reflexão da prática diária e desenvolvimento de pesquisas que possam trazer a fundamentação teórico filosófica para desvelar novos caminhos. O trabalho demonstra ser a humanização da prática pelo cuidado humano, uma necessidade das enfermeiras, assim como instiga futuras pesquisas para a aplicabilidade do marco de referência proposto. Abstract : This {{study had}} {{the objective of}} providing a framework point on human-caring for the transformation of practice. It was originated from a reflexive process {{of a group of}} nurses in the University Hospital of Parana State, inspired on determined carative factors by Jean Watson. The search was facilitated by the following guided question: ?What concepts can be utilized in the construction of a framwork for human care in Critical Units, in accordance with Watson's ideas, {{in such a way as}} to be incorpored, permanente adopted and utilized by nurses?? To produce the speeches, the researcher worked side by side with seven nurses, observing the group experience, <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>information</b> collected during the discussion of the following themes: care, nursing, human being and environment. After long period of reflexion on the material gathered, it has been possible to come up with concepts that helped produce this framework. Based on the themes, it was elaborated a reference point composed by the following concepts and subconcepts: care provider- care recipient, intersubjective, self-respect, self-care, self knowledge, integrality, exclusivity, spirituality, well being, satisfaction, relationship, vocation and motivation- nursing as philosophy, science and art of carel caring, nursing sensibility and responsability, love and affection, profissional self- concept, visibility of caring (valorization), ethic (dignity and respect) - environment, tecnology, ethic ideology, management, interaction, engagement and interference. Through reflexion, we realize the necessite of- revertion of the picture being currently experienced in Nursing practice, reviewing pattems of conduct with regarding to the mechanical act of technique, offering alternatives for combating lack of motivation and action of professionals, which can be achieved through training of care-providing personnel in the interactive process-, human valorization and growth by means of recognition of a Nursing science that focuses on caring; reflection about daily practice and development of research that can provide Nursing practice with theoretical - philosophical foundation in order to unveil new altematives. This work demonstrares that humanization of pratice through human care is a requirement that meets the destres of nurses who work in Critical Units, as wefi as encourages future research related to the applicability of the framework in Critical Care Units as in other areas...|$|E
40|$|This {{longitudinal}} study {{is an extension}} of a Master’s dissertation entitled “The state of skills readiness in the South African Public Service: an overview of the Department of Provincial and Local government” Sheoraj, R (2008). The earlier research project examined the capacity of the state to deliver on its promise for improved service delivery and a better life for all citizens. The National Skills Development Strategy, 2010 (NSDS) was evaluated to determine its effectiveness in tackling the serious challenge of skills in South Africa. This study examines the state of skills at local government, the underlying causes of capacity constraints and their implications for service delivery {{in the context of a}} developmental state. The argument is that local government is in the process of transformation. One of the critical constitutional features of local government in South Africa after 1994 is its developmental orientation. Local government requires appropriate skills to deliver on its mandate. Chapter 1 provides an overview of South Africa’s transition to democracy. It provides an overview of the transformation and recruitment practices of the Public Service and the skills policy interventions. Lastly, a brief overview of the framework of the study is provided. Chapter 2 describes the methodology of the research that is followed for <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>information</b> for the purpose of this study. Chapter 3 explores the literature associated with the development of the practice and theory of public administration. The skills challenges that the current administration faces is also examined in this chapter. The significance of public administration theories in South Africa’s modern Public Service is also expanded upon. Chapter 4 provides a background to the case study and profile of local government. It explores the role and characteristics of a developmental local government. Chapter 5 analyses the state of skills in municipalities with reference to a case setting of the uMgeni municipality in KwaZulu-Natal and the implications for good governance and service delivery. Chapter 6 encapsulates the dialogue generated in previous chapters. It will discuss research findings and propose recommendations to the challenges identified. It provides suggested responses, demonstrates examples of good practices adopted to address the complex issues relating to skills shortages and proposes a number of strategic approaches to address the issue of skills shortage. This study found that municipalities are mandated by various acts to become more developmental. In assisting them with the increased pressure to effectively deliver basic services and clear the current service backlogs, the Local government Municipal Structures Act 117 of 1998 mandates the implementation of Integrated Development Plans (lDP) as the main planning instrument for a municipal area. It was also found that along with the implementation of lDPs, the Municipal Structures Act mandates the implementation of performance management systems within the structures of the municipality. Currently, not a week passes without a news headline announcing that in one of the municipal areas of South Africa social unrest is high because of the lack of service delivery from the relevant municipality. The purpose of this study was not to find solutions for the lack of service delivery, but to critically evaluate the state of skills in local government and the implications for service delivery. The central aim of the study is, therefore to establish “What is the state of skills at local government in South Africa and to what extent can government intervention impact on skills development and service delivery to restore confidence in this sphere of government?” Even if the study does not aim to provide answers to the reasons related to poor service delivery the assessment provides insight into the formulation of policy processes. This study recommends that a vibrant interventionist policy approach by local governments will be the right step to address the issues of a developmental state and those of skills acquisition.

40|$|Competitive Intelligence (CI) {{has become}} {{increasingly}} important for organisations in the private sector, or profit-making organisations, because the level and intensity of competition has increased in recent years. This {{increase in the level}} and intensity of competition has also affected the public sector, or non-profit-making organisations, such as Public Service departments. In South Africa, the Public Service departments have undergone significant changes, in order to rectify the injustices of the past. Despite much progress, it is noticed that government does not have sufficient capacity to deliver and sustain a quality service to its citizens. It is further noted that improved service delivery cannot be implemented by issuing of circulars only, and it is not just an administrative activity, instead it is a dynamic process and to do this, Public Service managers require new management tools. The Department of Home Affairs (DHA) was chosen as the case study Public Service department for this study. The {{purpose of this study was}} to ascertain how competitive intelligence tools and techniques could be implemented in Public Service departments in South Africa to enhance the delivery of services. This aim was established during this study by addressing the following issues: • Identifying how CI tools and techniques could contribute to the functioning of the Public Service sector. The study outlined the benefits of CI for public service organisations and focussed on several tools and techniques that could be used. Most of these tools and techniques were not used in DHA. • Assessing the current state of Public Service delivery in South Africa. It became evident from the study that the Public Service sector and in particular DHA was experiencing several problems in terms of achieving its service delivery mandate. The Department lacked structured and formal frameworks, policies and strategies for conducting its operations. The organisation was viewed to have many unskilled and de-motivated staff. The current state of service delivery in South Africa also revealed disturbing findings of corruption, fraud, nepotism, and extreme despair in staff that had to work in these conditions. • Identifying gaps in the Public Service current strategies for service delivery. It was established that DHA does not use reliable techniques and methods when conducting its strategic planning. Furthermore, staff lacked the competencies, skills and experience to assist in strategic planning. The existing strategic plan for DHA does not address the future desires of the organisation and can be regarded as a plan to address the immediate issues of the organisation only. • Identifying the forms of competition that impact service delivery in Public Service departments in South Africa. Several forms of competition were encountered at DHA. These forms of competition can be divided into three different areas namely internal competition in DHA, external competition and left field competition. The information about these forms of competition was not readily available to managers and decision makers therefore appropriate actions could not be taken to counteract the impact of the competition on service delivery. • Identifying initiatives adopted by Public Service departments to improve service delivery. It was evident from the study that while the new initiatives being implemented by DHA to improve service delivery would be able to, and in some cases, have already had a positive impact on the operating and service delivery environment, several concerns were also identified. • Designing a new CI related framework for <b>gathering</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysing</b> <b>information</b> that can be used in all Public Service departments in South Africa to improve service delivery. From the empirical investigations it became evident that no single CI tool or technique would have been able to address the situation at DHA, therefore, a combination of tools was necessary. These tools were depicted in a CI framework that DHA could use to gather and analyse information for decision making and service delivery. • Suggesting proposed solutions and recommendations that can assist Public Service departments in South Africa in improving its service delivery. It was evident that CI can contribute towards the enhancement of decision making and service delivery not only in DHA but also in all other Public Service departments in South Africa.
