50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century there were few, if any black <b>funeral</b> <b>homes.</b> Survivors of deceased blacks were forced to depend on white <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> for embalming if they agreed to service them. Jim Crow laws and white bias required blacks to enter these white <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> through back doors and basements, a degrading experience that added to the tragedy of losing a loved one.|$|R

5|$|In {{the weeks}} after his death, a legal battle arose over Banks' estate and the {{disposition}} of his body. His estranged widow Elizabeth {{said that he had}} amended his will in October without her knowledge. The new will left all of Banks' assets to his longtime caregiver, Regina Rice. Banks had been diagnosed with dementia shortly before the change in his will. A Chicago <b>funeral</b> <b>home</b> sent Elizabeth a bill for $35,000 in funeral costs, but the bill went unpaid as Elizabeth challenged the legality of Banks' new will. In March 2015, the Chicago Cubs announced that they would pay the <b>funeral</b> <b>home</b> costs.|$|E

50|$|In 1968, eight Nova Scotia <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> {{decided to}} remove {{ambulances}} from {{their list of}} services provided to their community. Originally intended as just a favour for neighbours, the <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> became unable to meet demand.|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> {{have been}} family-owned small {{businesses}} which {{pride themselves on}} their personal, caring service. Many are located in historic houses worthy of preservation. In the past few decades, however, many family-owned <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> have been bought out by large, national corporations in search of big profits. The future of oldhouse <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> is uncertain. An inventory of <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> was conducted in a ninecounty area of east-central Indiana, including Blackford, Delaware, Grant, Hancock, Henry, Jay, Madison, Randolph, and Wayne Counties. Findings show that a majority (59 %) of the <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> in the nine-county area of east-central Indiana inventoried are located in former residences built before 1950, with varying degree of modification. While some have had minimal or moderate alterations, a large percentage (54 %) of these have been extensively altered over the years. Case studies of four pre- 1950 <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> in the inventory area revealed that alterations, many of which reflect {{the needs of the}} funeral business, have affected not only their integrity but also their ratings in the Indiana Historic Sites and Structures Inventory. Recommendations include greater communication between the funeral industry and preservationists, and the establishment of guidelines for sensitive additions that are addressed specifically {{to the needs of the}} funeral industry.

5|$|His {{final years}} {{were marked by}} poor health. Several weeks before his death, McAleer was {{admitted}} to a local hospital, where his health reportedly improved. This account, however, {{differs from that of}} baseball historian David Fleitz, who suggested that McAleer had been diagnosed with cancer in the early 1930s. In any event, McAleer died suddenly on April 29, 1931, shortly after being released from the hospital. He was 66 years old. After private funeral services at Orr's <b>funeral</b> <b>home,</b> McAleer's remains were interred at Oak Hill Cemetery, on Youngstown's near south side. Apart from his widow, he left behind two brothers, J.C. McAleer of Austintown, Ohio, and Owen McAleer of Los Angeles. Other survivors included two nephews, Captain Charlies McAleer, an officer in the U.S. Army, and James McAleer of Los Angeles.|$|E
5|$|Old Louisville is {{also home}} to the Ferguson Mansion, built by Edwin Hite Ferguson. Ferguson {{commissioned}} the Louisville architectural firm of Cobb and Dodd—the same firm responsible for designing the Seelbach Hotel and the new capitol building in Frankfort—to design his home in 1901. Construction of the mansion took four years (1901–1905) and cost $100,000, which was approximately ten times the cost of the neighboring Victorian homes. At the time, the mansion was the most expensive home in Louisville. In the 1920s, the Fergusons sold the home to the Pearson family, and it served as the Pearson <b>Funeral</b> <b>Home</b> until the mid-1970s. The house also provided the headquarters for John Y. Brown, Jr.'s successful 1979 gubernatorial campaign. In 1986, the mansion became the headquarters of The Filson Historical Society.|$|E

His family and friends, however, held a funeral for him at the Santa Cruz <b>funeral</b> <b>home</b> in Altozano, Morelia.

40|$|The {{need for}} a proper burial is widely felt. This paper makes use of an {{original}} data set to explore {{the relationship between the}} prices of cemetery plots and the prices of housing. It considers a simple model where the services from both real estate and <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> enter individuals’ utility function, and derives testable propositions in order to analyse the relation between housing when alive and after death. The services from <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> and from conventional housing are complements in the households’ utility. On the other hand, the services from <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> are an inferior good: a lower personal income is associated with higher grave prices...|$|R

50|$|In {{modern times}} coffins {{are almost always}} mass-produced. Some {{manufacturers}} do not sell directly to the public, and only work with <b>funeral</b> <b>homes.</b> In that case, the funeral director usually sells the casket to a family for a deceased person {{as part of the}} funeral services offered, and in that case the price of the casket is included in the total bill for services rendered.Some <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> will have a small showroom to present families with the available caskets {{that could be used for}} a deceased family member. In many modern <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> the showroom will consist of sample pieces that show the end pieces of each type of coffin that can be used. They also include samples of the lining and other materials. This allows <b>funeral</b> <b>homes</b> to showcase a larger number of coffin styles without the need for a larger showroom. Other types may be available from a catalogue, including decorative paint effects or printed photographs or patterns.|$|R
