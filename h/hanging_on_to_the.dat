He was unable to get into the boat and was left in the cold water, <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fenders of the motor boat. He was close to death before he was saved by passers by. The {{incident}} was taken up by the press and resulted in some embarrassment for Wilson; his press secretary, Joe Haines, tried to deflect some of the comment by blaming Wilson's dog for the problem.|$|E
25|$|Appleby Castle {{surrendered}} to the Scots on 31 July, whereat Lambert, who was still <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> flank of the Scottish advance, fell back from Barnard Castle to Richmond so as to close Wensleydale against any attempt of the invaders to march on Pontefract. All the restless energy of Langdale's horse was unable to dislodge Lambert from the passes or {{to find out what}} was behind that impenetrable cavalry screen. The crisis was now at hand. Cromwell had received the surrender of Pembroke Castle on 11 July, and had marched off, with his men unpaid, ragged and shoeless, at full speed through the Midlands. Rains and storms delayed his march, but he knew that the Duke of Hamilton in the broken ground of Westmorland was still worse off. Shoes from Northampton and stockings from Coventry met him at Nottingham, and gathering up the local levies as he went, he made for Doncaster, where he arrived on 8 August, having gained six days in advance of the time he had allowed himself for the march. He then called up artillery from Hull, exchanged his local levies for the regulars who were besieging Pontefract, and set off to meet Lambert. On 12 August he was at Wetherby, Lambert with horse and foot at Otley, Langdale at Skipton and Gargrave, Hamilton at Lancaster, and Sir George Monro with the Scots from Ulster and the Carlisle Royalists (organized as a separate command owing to friction between Monro and the generals of the main army) at Hornby. On 13 August, while Cromwell was marching to join Lambert at Otley, the Scottish leaders were still disputing whether they should make for Pontefract or continue through Lancashire so as to join Lord Byron and the Cheshire Royalists.|$|E

Rehman pointed to Michael Chopra and David Nugent, who both were top scorer in the Championship, but Nugent was called up for England while Chopra was not. Rehman claimed [...] "Why wasn't (Chopra) picked ahead of Dave Nugent? He's the top goal scorer in the Championship but he can't get in (the England set-up).

[...] Vigilant found Captain Howes still <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> deck fragment, which had been gradually getting smaller as seas tore off pieces. [...] He was taken on board after 33 hours in the water. [...] Vigilant picked up the men from the first boat, with the ship's mate on board.

2500|$|In 1959, the CIA {{predicted}} that Castro {{would have a}} difficult time <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> government. The major initial fear was that Castro would demand that a much higher rent be paid by the U.S. for possession of Guantanamo Bay. Early on there was a wait and see approach to judge if Castro was a communist. He was not deemed to be one initially, but his brother Raul was. General C. P. Cabell noted in November 1959 that while Castro was not a communist he allowed free opportunity to the communist party in Cuba to grow and spread its message. Nonetheless, by December plans were already being tossed around between high ranking US Foreign Policy Officials that called for overthrowing the Castro government. An official report from the CIA states that, by March 1960, the United States had already decided that Fidel Castro must be displaced. Due to the United States' fear of repercussions from the United Nations, the plan was kept at the highest level of secrecy, and as thus, [...] "plausible deniability" [...] was made a key focal point in American clandestine service policy.|$|E

25|$|The Boxer is a medium-sized, {{short-haired}} {{breed of}} dog, developed in Germany. The coat {{is smooth and}} tight-fitting; colours are fawn or brindled, with or without white markings, and white. Boxers are brachycephalic (they have broad, short skulls), have a square muzzle, mandibular prognathism (an underbite), very strong jaws, and a powerful bite ideal for <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> large prey. <b>The</b> Boxer was bred from the Old English Bulldog and the now extinct Bullenbeisser which became extinct by crossbreeding rather than by a decadence of the breed. The purpose of the crossbreeding was <b>the</b> wish <b>to</b> eliminate <b>the</b> excessive white color of the breed, {{and the necessity of}} producing thousands of dogs {{for one of the most}} popular breeds in the world. The Boxer is part of the Molosser group. This group is a category of solidly built, large dog breeds that all descend from the same common ancestor, the large shepherd dog known as a Molossus. The Boxer is a member of the Working Group.|$|R

50|$|The Women's Ice Hockey Club's first-ever {{games were}} {{a pair of}} losses at Cal on October 6 and 7, 2012, but the rivalry between the teams didn't fully ramp up until both joined the newly formed women's {{division}} of College Hockey East in 2013-14. The Lady Ice Lions and Vulcans spent that entire campaign jockeying for {{first place in the}} conference, first place in ACHA Division 2's East Region and, of course, with each other. During the regular season, the teams split a pair of games at Cal's Rostraver Ice Garden in October, then another pair late in the year at Pegula Ice Arena. The final game of those four, a 3-1 Penn State win on February 1, 2014, clinched the CHE regular season championship for the Lady Ice Lions after the Vulcans had put that outcome in doubt with a heated 5-2 win the night before. However, Cal forced a different sort of split - in the CHE titles - with a 2-1 win over PSU in the league playoff final at York City Ice Arena in York, PA behind a goal and an assist from Megan Cooper, which also enabled <b>the</b> western Pennsylvanians <b>to</b> finish with <b>the</b> East Region's top seed heading into the ACHA National Tournament.

50|$|Before {{the stage}} began, Moisés Dueñas was {{revealed}} to have failed {{a test for}} evidence of blood-doping {{at the end of}} stage 4, and was withdrawn by his team. Two more Barloworld riders withdrew injured during the stage, Félix Cárdenas and Paolo Longo Borghini. After 35 km, a 13-man breakaway, initiated by Fabian Wegmann and Kurt Asle Arvesen, formed, and with no rider within 20 minutes of the lead, came under no pressure from the main peloton. Gert Steegmans was dropped from this group on the first climb, {{but the rest of the}} breakaway increased their margin over the peloton. On the ascent of the Col de Portel, Amaël Moinard moved clear of the other escapees, and reached the top of the climb almost 2 minutes ahead of the rest of the group, while Óscar Pereiro moved ahead of the peloton, prompting a response by the CSC Saxo Bank team, and a split in the main field, but not isolating any GC contenders. Pereiro was re-integrated into the peloton with about 20 km remaining, while at the front of the race, Martin Elmiger and Arvesen attacked with 4 km left, shortly before Moinard was caught by the chasing group. They were joined by Alessandro Ballan, and briefly by Koos Moerenhout, and in the final 200m Arvesen started <b>the</b> sprint, <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> win <b>the</b> stage in a photo-finish.

25|$|The Byzantine Empire {{entered into}} {{a new era of}} decay in 1341. The Empire was ravaged by every {{possible}} disaster — alongside wars and civil wars, renewed epidemics of bubonic plague swept through its diminished lands. The first outbreak occurred in 1347, and between the 1360s and 1420s, eight further outbreaks of plague are recorded. Cities were full of social unrest between the corrupt wealthy (who had been exploiting the tax system for their own benefit) and the countless landless peasants burdened by the demands of the government. Religious controversy, the cancer of Byzantium in the 7th and 8th centuries, once again emerged {{in the form of the}} Hesychasm controversy, which eventually became a doctrine of the Eastern Orthodox church. There were numerous earthquakes, destroying Byzantium's infrastructure — the fortress of Gallipoli was destroyed in 1354 by such an earthquake and the Ottoman Turks lost no time in taking it and establishing a bridgehead in Europe. Meanwhile, the Serbs continued pressing south, removing any nominal Imperial control in Epirus. The Empire shrunk in size and when the civil war ended, Byzantium would be a petty city state, <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> life through <b>the</b> respites of her foes, and soon to-be protectors.|$|R

50|$|This large, {{high-end}} EF3 wedge tornado was {{spawned by}} the same parent supercell that produced the EF4 Katie/Wynnewood tornado. It first touched down <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of Davis, Oklahoma at 4:34 PM, initially snapping trees at EF1 strength near Route 77. The tornado moved across a large open field and began to widen significantly before it reached EF2 strength and crossed Sunshine Road, completely destroying a poorly constructed house and tossing a pickup truck hundreds of feet into a field. Numerous trees and power poles were snapped, and a brick home lost part of its roof in this area. The tornado intensified as it crossed Meadow Road further <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east, where trees were debarked and an unanchored home was completely swept away at high-end EF3 strength. Two poorly constructed homes in this area lost their roofs and exterior walls, sustaining EF2 damage. Damage became widespread as the tornado crossed Burnside Road, where multiple homes were left with only interior walls standing, mobile homes and outbuildings were obliterated, and unanchored block foundation homes were leveled and swept away. A large metal storage garage was swept away as well, with vehicles inside thrown up to 280 yards away. Several trees sustained debarking, and numerous metal power poles were bent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground. At one home in this area, 18 year-old resident Daniel Parks and his cousin survived the tornado without injury by taking shelter in an interior bathroom and <b>hanging</b> <b>on</b> <b>to</b> a toilet. <b>The</b> bathroom was the only room left standing after the tornado had passed.|$|R
