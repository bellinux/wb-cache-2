In Oil-Tech process, crushed oil shale is lifted by a conveyor {{system to the}} vertical retort, and is loaded into the retort from the top. The retort consists {{of a series of}} connected individual heating chambers, stacked atop each other. <b>Heating</b> <b>rods</b> extend into the centers of each of these chambers. The feed oil shale is heated to increasingly higher temperatures as it moves down the retort, attaining a temperature of [...] in the lowest chamber. The gases and vapors are vacuumed into a condensing unit. The spent shale is used for pre-heating feed oil shale. The advantages of this technology are its modular design, which enhances its portability and adaptability, its low water requirements, its heating efficiency, and the relatively high quality of the resulting product.|$|E

A circulating water cooling system were designed which include micro-channel heat sink, heat exchanger, micro-pump, rot meter, electric <b>heating</b> <b>rods,</b> and conversion fans for the experiment. The comparison was made between different metal foam samples in terms of flow rate and equilibrium temperature of heating boundary.

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Assessment of the ability of thermal hydraulic codes to correctly predict complex phenomena during reactor transients can be performed only by means of comparison against experimental data. The thermal hydraulic CATHARE V 1. 3 U computer program has been used to simulate International Standard Problem (ISP 38) experiment conducted at BETHSY Integral Test Facility located in Grenoble, France. BETHSY is an integral test facility modeling the three-loop, 2775 thermal NM Framatome Pressurized Water Reactor (PWR). Its main objectives are to contribute to the assessment of CATHARE code and of the physical basis of PWR Emergency Operating Procedures. This investigation dealt with experimental simulation of the loss of the Residual Heat Removal System (RHRS) during midloop operation. It involved opening of the pressurizer manway and the steam generator outlet plenum manway simultaneously with switching on the power of <b>heating</b> <b>rods,</b> thus simulating loss of the RHRS. The total power was kept unchanged with the level 138 kW throughout the test. Mass discharge through both manways led to core boiling and uncovery. A gravity feed injection of cold water was actuated in the cold leg when cladding temperature at the top of <b>heating</b> <b>rods</b> reached 250 C. The test was stopped when the primary cooling system was filled back to rnidloop level. The transient was executed on the HP 6400 workstation at Texas A&M University. The code predictions underestimated the time of the core uncovery and the actuation of the gravity feed injection due to the ovepredicted mass discharge through steain generator manway during the initial stage of the transient. This was probably caused by CATHARE's miscalculation of the phase separation effect at the hot leg/surge line tee junction and significant water entrainment into the surge line {{in the beginning of the}} test. It was found that the model of the upward tee junction needs to be refined for the low pressure range. Overall, the code's predictions were in a qualitative agreement with the experimental data...|$|E

The {{ceramic composite}} material used, contains {{three or more}} ceramic components. The base compound is silicon nitride, SiAlON or aluminum nitride. Electrical conductivity is modified using two or more ceramics. The first comprises one or more electrically-conducting metal silicide(s) selected from Mo, W, Ta, Nb, Ti, Zr, Hf, V and Cr. The second is of lesser electrical conductivity. The proportions of these components, determine electrical conductivity. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The second ceramic component is silicon carbide or B 4 C. At least one sintering additive is included. The proportions of silicide in the electrically-conducting and electrically-insulating ceramic composite materials, differ by at most 10 wt% and lie below the percolation threshold. The element is formed using silicon nitride, molybdenum silicide, silicon carbide and a sintering additive.

Holes with {{a depth of}} 0.7 [*]mm were drilled {{on the sides of}} the copper block. The accuracy of the T-type thermocouples used in the present experiments was ± 0.1 °C. A thermocouple was placed in each of these holes with sink grease to reduce the contact resistance, the positions of which were at the top, side, and bottom. Each hole was separated by a space of 7 [*]mm. The top of the copper block was the heated surface with varied surface wettability after modification. The side of the heated block was full of glass fiber for heat insulation. A glass tank with dimensions of 10 [*]cm[*]×[*] 10 [*]cm[*]×[*] 25 [*]cm was placed on the top of the heated block. The opening on the top of the tank maintained at atmospheric pressure, and the pool temperature was naturally adjusted to the saturated temperature (100 °C). The camera was placed on the top side of the tank to record the photos of growth bubbles. The heat source was placed under the heated block. The heating source was supplied by four 200 -W electric <b>heating</b> <b>rods.</b> The control heating source passed through the electricity supplier and outputs. After heating the surface, the thermometer recorder (MX- 100, Yokogawa, Musashino-shi, Tokyo, Japan) read the data that were measured by the thermocouples and transferred it to the computer for analysis. At the top position of the temperature data is the wall temperature; the temperature difference was obtained from the bottom position and the top position of the temperature data. Once the distance difference (14 [*]mm) and copper thermal conductivity were determined, the Fourier law (Equation [1]) was used to calculate the heat flux into the boiling liquid. Through energy balance equation, the heat loss can be calculated. The percentage of heat loss through insulation was 0.77 %. Uncertainties of the experimental measurement of heat flux and wall superheat were estimated using Equations [2] and [3]. The parameter Uq in these equations represents the uncertainty of the heat flux q and the parameter UTw represents the uncertainty of the wall temperature Tw. A homogeneous temperature profile on the surface was obtained in this study. The accuracy of the T-type thermocouples used in the present experiments was ± 0.1 °C. All the thermocouples were calibrated using an OMEGA-HH 41 thermistor (Stamford, CT, USA).|$|E
40|$|This project aims at {{designing}} and implementing a fuzzy controller for Multiple Input Single Output temperature process. Temperature control {{of water in}} the tank is achieved by varying current to the <b>heating</b> <b>rod</b> and inlet flow rate by a fuzzy controller. The system consists of a tank, reservoir, variable speed pump, temperature sensor placed inside a heating tank containing the <b>heating</b> <b>rod,</b> voltage controlled current source and computer. Water is pumped into the tank from reservoir and RTD measures the current temperature. The signal from the temperature sensor is sent to the DAQ interfaced to the computer. LabVIEW software is used to acquire the input signal and send the output signal that is determined by the control algorithm. Fuzzy logic controller is designed in LabVIEW. Based on the set point temperature, the controller sets the appropriate current to the <b>heating</b> <b>rod.</b> If the required temperature is less than that sensed by the temperature sensor, the flow rate of water into the tank is controlled by a variable speed pump. While conventional controllers are analytically described by a set of equations, the FLC is described by a knowledge-based algorithm. Thus this system is highly efficient in both heating and reducing the temperature of the tank. A fuzzy logic controller gives faster response, is more reliable and recovers quickly from system upsets.

40|$|During {{a loss of}} coolant {{accident}} in a pressurized water reactor, borated water is injected into the core through emergency core cooling system to reduce the decay heat, remove excess reactivity, and maintain an adequate core cooling throughout the full range of accident phases. Concentration of boric acid in the core is expected to increase over time due to the continuous vaporization of water from the core. Under certain conditions, the concentration may reach the solubility limit and precipitation of boric acid may occur. Hot leg switchover is a manual emergency procedure involving simultaneous injection through both the hot and cold legs to ensure adequate core flushing and prevent or mitigate precipitation of solid boric acid in the core. The nuclear research community, industry, and regulatory commission are currently collaborating to understand the possible effects of the precipitation of boric acid on adequate core cooling during the long-term phase of a loss of coolant scenario, particularly in understanding whether modifications of the current procedures are required. An experimental apparatus was constructed to conduct experiments with de-ionized water and boric acid, to observe and study the ow behavior, and to measure the boric acid concentration in boiling water environments in geometry similar to a pressurized water reactor. Three methods for quantifying boric acid content at very high concentrations, even exceeding saturation, were explored. A gravimetric method for concentration determination proved to be the most effective for high values as were observed in the test facility. Concentration of solution in the test section was approximately solved using an analytic approach for comparison to experimentally determined values. During experimentation, concentrations of boric acid were found to increase linearly with time. Rapid boiling in the test section induced uniform mixing in the test section, causing no appreciable difference in the concentration trends between various solution injection locations and other operational parameters of the facility. The rate of increase of boric acid concentration in the solution was observed to be proportional to the applied power to the <b>heating</b> <b>rods</b> in the facility test section. Comparison of boric acid concentration with the analytical solution confirmed that a fraction of the boric acid was transported within the vapor phase outside the test facility. Fractional boric acid loss from the test section was found to be lower than estimated from the observed losses during the calibration procedure. The constructed facility is used in the study of effects of the precipitate on coolant flow conditions related to cooling capabilities during the long-term cooling phase in a {{loss of coolant accident}}. Acquiring this understanding could help the resolution of General Safety Issue 191 as imposed by the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission...|$|E

In order to better understand this phenomena for the specific geometry of vertical, <b>heated</b> <b>rods</b> in water, an experimental facility was designed and constructed at Oregon State University. This facility, named the Laser-Imaged Natural Circulation (LINC) facility, consists of a water tank capped with a custom cooling plate through which two <b>heated</b> <b>rods</b> pass into the tank. The LINC facility enables flow patterns in the channel between the <b>heated</b> <b>rods</b> to be imaged and quantified using particle image velocimetry (PIV).

While the PWR bundle uses a single unheated <b>rod,</b> 20 <b>heated</b> <b>rods,</b> and 4 corner rods arranged on a square lattice, with a heated length of 1000 mm, the VVER bundle uses 13 unheated <b>rods,</b> 18 <b>heated</b> <b>rods</b> and 6 corner rods, arranged on a hexagonal lattice. The test was conducted at the Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe on 27 September 2006 with largely the same protocol as QUENCH- 06, in order to demonstrate the effects on the VVER characteristics more readily.

40|$|Thermal {{stratification}} is {{encountered in}} large {{pool of water}} increasingly being used as heat sink in new generation of advanced reactors. These large pools at near atmospheric pressure provide a heat sink for heat removal from the reactor or steam generator, and the containment by natural circulation {{as well as a}} source of water for core cooling. For examples, the PAFS (passive auxiliary feedwater system) is one of the advanced safety features adopted in the APR+(Advanced Power Reactor Plus), which is intended to completely replace the conventional active auxiliary feedwater system [1, 2]. The PAFS cools down the steam generator secondary side and eventually removes the decay heat from the reactor core by adopting a natural convection mechanism. In a pool, the heat transfer from the PCHX (passive condensation heat exchanger) contributed to increase the pool temperature up to the saturation condition and induce the natural circulation flow of the PCCT (passive condensate cooling tank) pool water [3]. When a <b>heat</b> <b>rod</b> is placed horizontally in a pool of water, the fluid adjacent to the <b>heat</b> <b>rod</b> gets <b>heated</b> up. In the process, its density reduces and by virtue of the buoyancy force, the fluid in this region moves up.

Since this heated water is cooling, it goes downward along the wall at the other side wall. Above heater rod, a natural circulation flow is formed.

Results: The study focused on sensing the presence of water in kerosene using the established correlation between the content of hydrocarbon emulsion and {{the characteristics of the}} acoustic wave generated by inundation of a <b>heated</b> <b>rod</b> in the emulsion. The implemented filteration enhanced the peromance of the measurment system. Conclusion: This approach was tested experimentally and showed that the produced acoustic signal can be utilized as an informative parameter in quality control schemes of petrochemical oil products...|$|R

This models the situation where one end of the rod is inaccessible. We derive and test two different algorithms to numerically estimate the length of the rod, and demonstrate their performance through numerical examples. 1. Introduction. Although we may not be aware of it, inverse problems are omnipresent in our daily lives. Blast furnaces where high-temperature reactions occur provide a great forum for understanding what is meant by the term “inverse problems”. (See [3].) The walls of these furnaces are subject to extreme amounts of heat on a constant basis, which in turn causes the materials making up th...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} an illustrative {{application of the}} Second-Order Adjoint Sensitivity Analysis Methodology (2 nd-ASAM) developed by Cacuci (2015) to a paradigm nonlinear heat conduction benchmark, which models a conceptual experimental test section containing <b>heated</b> <b>rods</b> immersed in liquid lead-bismuth eutectic. This benchmark admits an exact solution, thereby making transparent the underlying mathematical derivations. For this illustrative problem, six large-scale adjoint computations sufficed to compute exactly all five 1 st-order and fifteen distinct 2 nd-order derivatives of the temperature response to the five model parameters. Very significantly, only the sources on the right-sides of the heat conduction differential operator need to be modified; the left-side of the differential equations (and hence the solver in large-scale practical applications) remains unchanged.
