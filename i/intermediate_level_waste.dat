40|$|Romania has {{a single}} nuclear power plant (NPP) located at the Cernavoda site. This NPP is CANDU 6, a Canadian type reactor design. At present, one single unit of the five that are planned for is in operation, and a second plant is under construction. The plant is owned and {{operated}} by Nuclearelectrica National Company (SNN). The currently operating NPP has only the initial pretreatment step in its waste management system. As it is described in specific documents of the International Atomic Energy (IAEA) documents, this pretreatment consists of collection, segregation, decontamination (if appropriate), precompaction and a period of on-site interim storage. SNN has established a policy for the long-term management of its own waste. This includes the identification of a destination for the wastes in accordance with legal requirements and proven technologies, which will be acceptable to the regulatory body. For short-lived low and <b>intermediate</b> <b>level</b> <b>wastes,</b> a near surface disposal facility is being considered. For high- <b>level</b> <b>wastes</b> (mainly spent fuel), and long-lived low and <b>intermediate</b> <b>level</b> <b>wastes,</b> interim storage followed by geological disposal represents the most suitable option at this time. The top management of SNN has reviewed its strategy and established the target objectives for implementing its policy on medium term. For the next three years, priority will be given to constructing an independent spent fuel dry storage facility at the Cernavoda NPP site. Based on the selection process being followed in Romania, the supplier of the dry storage technology will be announced in early 2001.
