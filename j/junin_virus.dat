40|$|Emerging viruses {{including}} Nipah, Hendra, Lujo, and <b>Junin</b> <b>viruses</b> {{have enormous}} potential to spread rapidly. Nipah virus, after {{emerging as a}} zoonosis, has also evolved the capacity for human-to-human transmission. Most of the diseases caused by these pathogens are untreatable and require high biocontainment conditions. Universal methods for rapidly identifying and screening candidate antivirals are urgently needed. We have developed a modular antiviral platform strategy that relies on simple bioinformatic and genetic information about each pathogen. Central to this platform {{is the use of}} envelope glycoprotein cDNAs to establish multi-cycle replication systems under BSL 2 conditions for viral pathogens that normally require BSL 3 and BSL 4 facilities. We generated monoclonal antibodies against Nipah G by cDNA immunization in rats, and we showed that these antibodies neutralize both Nipah and Hendra live viruses. We then used these effective Henipavirus inhibitors to validate our screening strategy. Our proposed strategy should contribute to the response capability fo...|$|R
40|$|Hemorrhagic fever viruses, {{including}} the filoviruses (Ebola and Marburg) and arenaviruses (Lassa and <b>Junín</b> <b>viruses),</b> are serious human pathogens {{for which there}} are currently no FDA approved therapeutics or vaccines. Importantly, transmission of these viruses, and specifically late steps of budding, critically depend upon host cell machinery. Consequently, strategies which target these mechanisms represent potential targets for broad spectrum host oriented therapeutics. An important cellular signal implicated previously in EBOV bud-ding is calcium. Indeed, host cell calcium signals are increasingly being recognized {{to play a role}} in steps of entry, replication, and transmission for a range of viruses, but if and how filoviruses and arenaviruses mobilize calcium and the precise stage of virus transmission regulated by calcium have not been defined. Here we demonstrate that expression of matrix proteins from both filoviruses and arenaviruses triggers an increase in host cytoplasmic Ca 2 + concentration by a mechanism that requires host Orai 1 channels. Furthermore, we demonstrate that Orai 1 regulates both VLP and infectious filovirus and arenavirus produc-tion and spread. Notably, suppression of the protein that triggers Orai activation (Stroma...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY Monoclonal {{antibodies}} prepared against Tacaribe and <b>Junin</b> <b>viruses</b> {{have been}} used to define further the serological relationships between arenaviruses of the Tacaribe complex. A close relationship was found between these two viruses and the heterologous Amapari and Machupo viruses, with Pichinde virus and Parana virus being more distantly related. Among the antibodies pecific for Tacaribe virus, five were found to react with viral antigens at the surface of infected cells and to neutralize virus infectivity in vitro. These five antibodies could be differentiated by competitive immunoassay srecognizing at least wo antigenically distinct epitopes. The kinetics of reaction between antibody and virus were examined for all five neutralizing antibodies. One antibody (2. 25. 4) effectively neutralized all infectious virus. The remaining four directed against a second epitope gave significant persistent fractions which could be reduced by addition of complement, anti-mouse immunoglobulin, or antibody 2. 25. 4.

40|$|We {{screened}} ∼ 2, 200 compounds {{known to}} be safe in people for the ability {{to reduce the amount}} of virion-associated hepatitis B virus (HBV) DNA in the culture medium of producer cells. These efforts led to the discovery of an alkylated porphyrin, chlorophyllide, as the compound that achieved the greatest reduction in signal. Here we report that chlorophyllide directly and quantitatively disrupted HBV virions at micromolar concentrations, resulting in the loss of all detectable virion DNA, without detectably affecting cell viability or intracellular viral gene products. Chemophores of chlorophyllide were also tested. Chlorin e 6, a metal-free chlorophyllide-like molecule, showed the strongest antiviral activity against HBV as well as profound antiviral effects on other enveloped viruses, such as hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), dengue virus (DENV), Marburg virus (MARV), Tacaribe <b>virus</b> (TCRV), and <b>Junin</b> <b>viruses</b> (JUNV). Remarkably, chlorin e 6 inactivated DENV at subnanomolar-level concentrations. However, the compound had no antiviral effect against encephalomyocarditis virus and adenovirus, suggesting that chlorin e 6 may be less active or inactive against nonenveloped viruses. Although other porphyrin derivatives have been previously reported to possess antiviral activity, this is the first analysis of the biochemical impact of chlorophyllide and chlorin e 6 against HBV and of the dramatic anti-infectivity impact upon DENV.

40|$|Background: Lassa and <b>Junín</b> <b>viruses</b> are {{the most}} {{prominent}} members of the Arenaviridae family of viruses that cause viral hemorrhagic fever syndromes Lassa fever and Argentine hemorrhagic fever, respectively. At present, ribavirin is the only antiviral drug indicated for use in treatment of these diseases, but because of its limited efficacy in advanced cases of disease and its toxicity, safer and more effective antivirals are needed. Methodology/Principal Findings: Here, we used a model of acute arenaviral infection in outbred guinea pigs based on challenge with an adapted strain of Pichindé virus (PICV) to further preclinical development of T- 705 (Favipiravir), a promising broad-spectrum inhibitor of RNA virus infections. The guinea pig-adapted passage 19 PICV was uniformly lethal with an LD 50 of, 5 plaque-forming units and disease was associated with fever, weight loss, thrombocytopenia, coagulation defects, increases in serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) concentrations, and pantropic viral infection. Favipiravir (300 mg/kg/day, twice daily orally for 14 days) was highly effective, as all animals recovered fully from PICVinduced disease even when therapy was initiated one week after virus challenge when animals were already significantly ill with marked fevers and thrombocytopenia. Antiviral activity and reduced disease severity was evidenced by dramatic reductions in peak serum virus titers and AST concentrations in favipiravir-treated animals.

40|$|The family Arenaviridae, genus Arenavirus, {{consists}} of two phylogenetically independent groups: Old World (OW) and New World (NW) complexes. The Lassa and Lujo viruses in the OW complex and the Guanarito, Junin, Machupo, Sabia, and Chapare viruses in the NW complex cause viral hemorrhagic fever (VHF) in humans, leading to serious public health concerns. These viruses are also considered potential bioterrorism agents. Therefore, it is of great importance to detect these pathogens rapidly and specifically {{in order to minimize}} the risk and scale of arenavirus outbreaks. However, these arenaviruses are classified as BSL- 4 pathogens, thus making it difficult to develop diagnostic techniques for these virus infections in institutes without BSL- 4 facilities. To overcome these difficulties, antibody detection systems {{in the form of an}} enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and an indirect immunofluorescence assay were developed using recombinant nucleoproteins (rNPs) derived from these viruses. Furthermore, several antigen-detection assays were developed. For example, novel monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) to the rNPs of Lassa and <b>Junin</b> <b>viruses</b> were generated. Sandwich antigen-capture (Ag-capture) ELISAs using these mAbs as capture antibodies were developed and confirmed to be sensitive and specific for detecting the respective arenavirus NPs. These rNP-based assays were proposed to be useful not only for an etiological diagnosis of VHFs, but also for seroepidemiological studies on VHFs. We recently developed arenavirus neutralization assays using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) -based pseudotypes bearing arenavirus recombinant glycoproteins. The goal of this article is to review the recent advances in developing laboratory diagnostic assays based on recombinant viral proteins for the diagnosis of VHFs and epidemiological studies on the VHFs caused by&nbsp;arenaviruses...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Junin</b> <b>virus</b> genome is {{composed}} of two single-stranded RNA molecules, each encoding two different genes in an ambisense orientation.

The GPC is subsequently cleaved to form two viral glycoproteins, GP1 and GP2, which ultimately form the T-shaped glycoprotein spike which extends outwards from the viral envelope. http://virology.ifas.ufl.edu/course/Arenavirus.ppt#285,14,Slide14.

In contrast, analogous peptides derived from cellular SKI- 1 /S 1 P substrates were remarkably poor substrates.
