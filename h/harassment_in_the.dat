25|$|This distinguishes {{bullying}} from isolated behaviours {{and other}} forms of job stress and allows the term workplace bullying to be applied in various contexts and to behaviours that meet these characteristics. Many observers agree that bullying is often a repetitive behaviour.

Expanding the common understanding of bullying to include single, severe episodes also parallels the legal definitions of sexual <b>harassment</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} will investigate {{the problem of}} racial <b>harassment</b> and discrimination <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace. This problem of racial <b>harassment</b> and discrimination <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace is based on section 6 of the Employment Equity Act 1 (EEA) which lays the foundation of this research. In chapter one of this dissertation the background of our constitutional dimension is discussed {{as it is the}} cornerstone of our law. 2 Chapter one also raises racial harassment and discrimination as a problem <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace. Chapter 2 discusses the pre-democratic, the transition to democracy and the post-democratic racial position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace. Chapter 2 enables the reader to have a full understanding of South Africa?s racial history particularly in employment. Chapter 3 analyses how South African courts address the problem of racial <b>harassment</b> and discrimination <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace. This analysis is done by way of discussing cases that have dealt with racial harassment. Further issues that are discussed in chapter 3 are whether the sanction of dismissal imposed by courts <b>in</b> racial <b>harassment</b> and discrimination cases are appropriate. How courts address the sensitivity of employees towards racial <b>harassment</b> and discrimination <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace and finally the employers duty to protect employees from racial harassment and discrimination. This is done by way of a broader discussion of case law and section 60 of the EEA. Chapter 4 is the comparative chapter where racial harassment and discrimination from the United States of America (USA) perspective is analysed and compared to South Africa. <b>In</b> this chapter <b>the</b> Civil Rights Act of 1964 is used to discuss the test that USA courts use to establish racial <b>harassment</b> and discrimination <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace. The employer?s duty to protect employees from racial harassment is also discussed in chapter 4, as well as the tests used by courts to establish liability on the part of <b>the</b> employer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> USA. Chapter 5 includes recommendations on how courts and employers can ensure that the remedies that they impose on employees who are guilty of racial <b>harassment</b> are effective <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elimination of racial <b>harassment</b> and discrimination <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace.

25|$|Sexual {{harassment}} is defined as, when any verbal, non-verbal or physical action {{is used to}} change a victim's sexual status against {{the will of the}} victim and resulting in the victim feeling inferior or hurting the victim's dignity.

25|$|A ban on {{discrimination}} {{was included}} in the Federal Constitution (Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the old Federal Constitution) in 1981 and adopted in Article 8, paragraph 2 of the revised Constitution.

Article 4 of the GEA defines the circumstances, Article 5 legal rights and Article 10 protection against dismissal during the complaints procedure. Article 328, paragraph 1 of the Code of Obligations (OR), Article 198 (2) of the Penal Code (StGB) and Article 6, paragraph 1 of the Employment Act (ArG) contain further statutory provisions on the ban on sexual harassment. The ban on sexual harassment is intended exclusively for employers, within the scope of their responsibility for protection of legal personality, mental and physical well-being and health.|$|E
