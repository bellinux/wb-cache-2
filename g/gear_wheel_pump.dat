40|$|Two-component ceramic {{injection}} moulding allows combining materials with different properties {{for a high}} throughput, net-shape production of multifunctional parts. However, the challenge of this shaping technology is adjusting the shrinkage of both components during {{injection moulding}}, co-debinding and co-sintering. Moreover, the materials chosen for the combination must have comparable thermal expansion coefficients and similar sintering behaviour. In the frame of a European project 14 partners from seven European countries are developing ceramic components for automotive and railway applications by two-component low pressure (2 C-LCIM) and high pressure ceramic injection moulding (2 C-CIM). The outcome of the project will be parts with complex geometry consisting of two ceramic materials with different mechanical, electrical or tribological properties like a ceramic glow plug for Diesel engines, a <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> for fuel <b>pumps,</b> a valve seat and braking pads for high-speed train brakes.

50|$|This is a {{powerful}} horse mill for four horses; probably English ponies, as modern heavy horses were not yet fully bred in the 1830s. Each of the four heavy oak beams connecting the central axle to the four horse shafts runs from beside the axle to the under-surface of the main <b>gear</b> <b>wheel,</b> and crosses the other three in a grid pattern between the axle and <b>gear</b> <b>wheel,</b> thus supporting the <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> and creating a rigid structure at the same time. They project for many feet beyond the main <b>gear</b> <b>wheel,</b> and require wooden stretchers to stabilise them. From the ends of these beams hang the horse shafts. The bottom ends of these shafts are quite low, which may indicate the use of ponies rather than early heavy horses.|$|R

One axis is an optical axis (A-A) along which a light beam emitted by a light source runs. The rotating movements of the mirror (4) are caused by two drive motors (1, 2), whereby the rotating movement of the mirror is transferred onto the optical axis (A-A) perpendicular to the standing axis (B-B) via a differential gear (5). The differential gear (5) has two intermeshing <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> (10, 11). The mirror (4) is arranged in a mirror holder (3) connected to a hollow shaft rotatable about the axis (B-B). One <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> (11) of the differential gear (5) is attached to the mirror (4) and the other <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> (10) is connected to the drive shaft (12) of the second drive motor (11).

25|$|The chariots of Yan Su and Wu Deren {{appear to}} have used this type of mechanism. (See {{descriptions}} quoted from the Song Shi, above.) Apart from the presence of components in Wu Deren's vehicle to make it function as an odometer, there were only minor differences between them. In each chariot, the two main road wheels were attached to vertical <b>gear</b> <b>wheels.</b> A large horizontal <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> was linked (possibly via intermediate gearing) to the pointing doll, and was positioned so a diameter almost spanned {{the space between the}} uppermost points of the vertical <b>gear</b> <b>wheels.</b> When the chariot was moving straight ahead, there was no connection between these gears, but when the chariot turned, a small <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> was lowered into contact with the horizontal gear and one of the vertical gears, thus linking the doll to one of the road <b>wheels.</b> Two small <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> were available, one to connect the horizontal gear to each of the vertical ones. Of course, they were not used simultaneously. The small <b>gear</b> <b>wheels</b> were raised and lowered by an arrangement of weights, pulleys and cords which were attached to the pole to which the horses that pulled the chariot were harnessed. When the horses moved to one side or the other, in order to turn the chariot, the pole moved and the cords lowered the appropriate small <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> into its working position. When the horses returned to walking straight ahead, the small <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> was raised out of contact with the main horizontal and vertical gears. Thus the system functioned automatically. The mirror-symmetry of the vertical gears being linked by the small gears to the horizontal gear at diametrically opposite points caused the horizontal gear to rotate in opposite directions depending on which road wheel was linked to it, thus rotating the pointing doll in opposite directions when the chariot turned left and right.|$|R

40|$|Additive manufacturing, {{especially}} SLM, {{provides a}} suitable technology for manufacturing complex parts. This enables innovative product design for resource efficiency and effectiveness via light weight design or functional integration. Employing this potential, the presented project focuses on increasing transmission efficiency of a <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> by reducing load-independent power losses {{induced by the}} cooling lubricant. The cooling and lubrication system is improved by implementing internal conformal cooling channels via additive manufacturing. This way a volume reduction of the lubricant is pursued resulting in greatly diminished oil churning, windage, and squeezing losses. As a consequence, overall transmission efficiency can be increased by employing an innovative functional <b>gear</b> <b>wheel</b> design.
