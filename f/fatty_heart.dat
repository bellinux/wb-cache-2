40|$|The {{status of}} the circulatory system in obesity {{has been the subject}} of {{considerable}} interest, study, and conjecture for many years. Laennec (1) mentioned the "fatty heart " as an anatomic condition, while Stokes (2) thought he could recognize it clinically. In more recent years chief interest has centered on the pathologic physiology of the condition and the clinical ' conception of the <b>fatty</b> <b>heart</b> as such has, for all practical purposes, passed into discard. It is recognized that symptoms which may be taken as evidence of cardiac insufficiency may manifest themselves in obesity where the pathological changes found in the circulatory system seem hardly commensurate with these symptoms. Many have consid-ered the primary disturbance in these cases to be in the heart, and Hirsch (3), who showed that the muscle mass of the heart is relatively small for the weight of the obese patient, looked upon this disproportion as an important factor in the relative inefficiency of the heart in obesity; Romberg (4) also holds this view.

40|$|A {{long-term}} high-energy diet affects {{human health}} and leads to obesity and metabolic syndrome in addition to cardiac steatosis and hypertrophy. Ectopic fat accumulation in the heart has been demonstrated to be {{a risk factor for}} heart disorders, but the molecular mechanism of heart disease remains largely unknown. Bama miniature pigs were fed a high-fat, high-sucrose diet (HFHSD) for 23 months. These pigs developed symptoms of metabolic syndrome and showed cardiac steatosis and hypertrophy with a greatly increased body weight (2. 73 -fold, P< 0. 01), insulin level (4. 60 -fold, P< 0. 01), heart weight (1. 82 -fold, P< 0. 05) and heart volume (1. 60 -fold, P< 0. 05) compared with the control pigs. To understand the molecular mechanisms of cardiac steatosis and hypertrophy, nine pig heart cRNA samples were hybridized to porcine GeneChips. Microarray analyses revealed that 1, 022 genes were significantly differentially expressed (P< 0. 05, ≥ 1. 5 -fold change), including 591 up-regulated and 431 down-regulated genes in the HFHSD group relative to the control group. KEGG analysis indicated that the observed heart disorder involved the signal transduction-related MAPK, cytokine, and PPAR signaling pathways, energy metabolism-related fatty acid and oxidative phosphorylation signaling pathways, heart function signaling-related focal adhesion, axon guidance, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and actin cytoskeleton signaling pathways, inflammation and apoptosis pathways, and others. Quantitative RT-PCR assays identified several important differentially expressed heart-related genes, including STAT 3, ACSL 4, ATF 4, FADD, PPP 3 CA, CD 74, SLA- 8, VCL, ACTN 2 and FGFR 1, which may be targets of further research. This study shows that a long-term, high-energy diet induces obesity, cardiac steatosis, and hypertrophy and provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of hypertrophy and <b>fatty</b> <b>heart</b> to facilitate further research...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectivesPerioperative {{myocardial}} {{damage is}} {{a major determinant of}} postoperative cardiac dysfunction for congenital <b>heart</b> disease. <b>Heart</b> <b>fatty</b> acid–binding protein is reported to be a rapid marker of perioperative myocardial damage that peaks earlier than creatine kinase isoenzyme MB or cardiac troponin T in adults. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the suitability of using serum concentrations of <b>heart</b> <b>fatty</b> acid–binding protein for evaluation of perioperative myocardial damage in pediatric cardiac surgery. MethodsAfter institutional review board approval and informed consent, 100 children undergoing open procedures for congenital heart disease were prospectively enrolled in the study. Mean age at operation was 4. 9 ± 0. 4 years. Serum concentrations of <b>heart</b> <b>fatty</b> acid–binding protein, creatine kinase isoenzyme MB, and cardiac troponin T were measured serially before operation and at 0, 1, 2, 3, and 6 hours after aortic declamping. Relationships between serum peak level of <b>heart</b> <b>fatty</b> acid–binding protein and intraoperative and postoperative clinical variables were evaluated. ResultsSerum <b>heart</b> <b>fatty</b> acid–binding protein reached its peak level at 1 hour after declamping in 95 patients (95 %), which was significantly earlier (P <. 01) than serum creatine kinase isoenzyme MB or cardiac troponin T. In addition, serum <b>heart</b> <b>fatty</b> acid–binding protein level immediately after declamping correlated strongly with serum peak <b>heart</b> <b>fatty</b> acid–binding protein level (r = 0. 91, P <. 01). The serum peak level of <b>heart</b> <b>fatty</b> acid–binding protein correlated with those of creatine kinase isoenzyme MB (r = 0. 77, P <. 01) and cardiac troponin T (r = 0. 80, P <. 01). In the forward stepwise multiple regression analysis, age (P <. 0001), aortic crossclamp time (P <. 0001), the presence of a ventriculotomy (P <. 001), and the lowest hematocrit level during cardiopulmonary bypass (P <. 05) were significant intraoperative variables that influenced the release of <b>heart</b> <b>fatty</b> acid–binding protein. There were significant relationships between serum peak <b>heart</b> <b>fatty</b> acid–binding protein level and postoperative inotropic support, duration of intubation, and intensive care unit stay (P <. 01 for each). ConclusionsHeart fatty acid–binding protein is a rapid marker for assessment of myocardial damage and clinical outcome in pediatric cardiac surgery. In particular, serum <b>heart</b> <b>fatty</b> acid–binding protein level immediately after aortic declamping may be a potentially useful prognostic indicator of myocardial damage as well as clinical outcome in pediatric cardiac surgery...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} {{a number of}} {{theoretical}} models, describing light propagation in matter, have been applied to and developed for the examination of tissue. The aim was to model the light scattering and absorption in tissue {{in order to improve}} the understanding of underlying mechanisms of laser-based diagnostics and treatment modalities utilised for cancer and cardiovascular diseases. The models studied ranged from the simplest Beer-Lambert law, assuming a plain exponential behaviour of the light transport, to solutions of Maxwell's fundamental equations for the scattering of electromagnetic waves. The latter approach was specifically used for computations of light scattering by red blood cell volume-equivalent spheroids by applying the numerical T-matrix formalism. Furthermore, the adding-doubling method, based on the radiative transport equation for multiple scattering, as well as the stochastic Monte Carlo approach, describing the light transport as a random walk process of photons, were employed to model light propagation in dense tissue. The advantages and disadvantages of each model are discussed by exemplifying which applications they are useful for and valid in. Light scattering and absorption in tissue were also studied in practice. The absorption and scattering characteristics governing the macroscopic light propagation were determined in vitro in terms of the absorption and scattering coefficients as well as the g-factor, employing different integrating-sphere techniques. Changes in these fundamental optical properties were monitored for tissue being exposed to laser-based treatment modalities, such as photodynamic therapy (PDT) and continuous or pulsed thermotherapy. The observed influence on the scattering properties and the manifest increase in the absorption coefficient could be related to mainly morphological and biochemical changes in the blood and/or microvascular damage in the tissue. The latter was further confirmed by an imaging technique showing changes in laser-Doppler signals from moving red blood cells in conjunction with PDT, indicating a local increase in tissue perfusion. Differences in tissue characteristics were monitored in vivo, in order to distinguish diseased from healthy tissue alone, or in combination with photosensitive agents, employing laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) or near infrared (NIR) spectroscopy. Malignancies in the skin and in the oesophagus could be identified utilising the tumour selective agents ALA and Photofrin respectively, in conjunction with LIF. It was also shown to be possible to spectroscopically distinguish fibrous and <b>fatty</b> <b>heart</b> tissue from healthy myocardium in vitro using either LIF or NIR spectroscopy, if combined with a powerful analysis method such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) ...|$|E

The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the effects of age and ischemic time on the biochemical evidence and clinical outcomes of myocardial damage in pediatric cardiac surgery. MethodsA prospective observational cohort study conducted over 2. 5 years was performed in 98 consecutive patients (51 infants and 47 children) undergoing cardiac surgery for ventricular septal defects. Serial measurements of serum levels of <b>heart</b> <b>fatty</b> acid–binding protein and the respective areas under the curve were obtained, with particular reference to age and aortic crossclamp time. Assessment of clinical outcomes included inotropic support, ventilatory support, and intensive care unit stay. ResultsThere was a linear dependence of the logarithm of age and the logarithm of <b>heart</b> <b>fatty</b> acid–binding protein release(r = 0. 737, P <. 0001). This logarithm-logarithm plot showed a power function of age for <b>heart</b> <b>fatty</b> acid–binding protein release. The exponent and amplitude parameter of the power function was the aortic crossclamp time. Compared with children, infants had significantly more myocardial damage and worse clinical outcomes, and these factors were related to the aortic crossclamp time. ConclusionsThe younger the age of patients, the more vulnerable are their myocardia to injury caused by ischemia during definitive repair of congenital heart disease. Therefore, perioperative management for pediatric patients after cardiac surgery should be performed, taking into consideration the dependence of the myocardial damage on age and ischemic time...|$|R
40|$|In current medical {{practice}} an elevation {{in the level}} of the biochemical marker cardiac troponin is used to identify patients with acute chest pain who have an acute myocardial infarction and to predict the risk of recurrent adverse events. This strategy is sub-optimal. In addition, other available early markers of myocyte injury are not specific. The aim of the research presented in this thesis was to assess early detection of myocardial infarction in patients with chest pain using additional biomarkers and to determine their role in the subsequent 1 year follow-up. Patients presenting to 2 coronary care units With. ischaemic type chest pain between August 2003 - July 2006 were recruited prospectively. Patients were assessed on admission for clinical characteristics, ECG features, renal function, cardiac troponin T, inflammatory markers (high sensitivity CRP, myeloperoxidase, matrix metalloproteinase- 9, pregnancy associated plasma protein-A, soluble CD 40 ligand), haemostatic markers (fibrinogen, D-dimer), myocyte injury markers (<b>heart</b> <b>fatty</b> acid binding protein, glycogen phosphorylase-BB), and the neurohormonal marker NT-proBNP. A 12 hour ~ardiac troponin T sample was also obtained. For diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction, the performance of the additional biomarkers were compared with the initial sample of cardiac troponin T. Patients were followed up for 1 year for the incidence of adverse events. The value of elevated biomarkers for risk stratification was assessed. The sensitivity of <b>heart</b> <b>fatty</b> acid binding protein for acute myocardial infarction was superior to initial cardiac troponin T for patients presenting within 4 hours of symptom onset.

40|$|This review {{asks the}} {{question}} if further research on {{trans fatty acids}} and cardiovascular health is needed. We therefore review the evidence from human studies on trans fatty acids and cardiovascular health, and provide a quantitative review of effects of trans fatty acid intake on lipoproteins. The {{results show that the}} effect of industrially produced trans <b>fatty</b> acids on <b>heart</b> health seen in observational studies is larger than predicted from changes in lipoprotein concentrations. There is debate on the effect of ruminant trans fatty acids and cardiovascular disease. Of special interest is conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which is produced industrially for sale as supplements. Observational studies do not show higher risks of cardiovascular disease with higher intakes of ruminant trans fatty acids. However, CLA, industrial and ruminant trans fatty acids all raise plasma low-density lipoprotein and the total to high-density lipoprotein ratio. Gram for gram, all trans fatty acids have largely the same effect on blood lipoproteins. In conclusion, the detrimental effects of industrial trans <b>fatty</b> acids on <b>heart</b> health are beyond dispute. The exact size of effect will remain hard to determine.

Design: Patients (n = 84) with ≥ 1440 PVCs/ 24 h in a previous Holter recording were randomly assigned to receive 1. 5 g/d of either n- 3 fatty acids or placebo. Two 24 -h Holter recordings were made at baseline, and 2 were made after an intervention of ≈ 14 wk. Results: Treatment did not significantly affect the number of PVCs. The number decreased in the fish-oil group by 867 / 24 h more than it decreased in placebo group (95 % CI: - 3187, 1453).

In the present study, we investigated the efficacy of increasing the dose and administration period of landiolol for prevention of postoperative AF, {{as well as the}} effect of oral bisoprolol in the early postoperative period. Patients and MethodsA total of 105 patients who underwent coronary artery bypass grafting were randomized to 3 groups: a group receiving intravenous landiolol perioperatively at 5 μg/kg/min for 3 days (group L), a group receiving oral bisoprolol postoperatively together with landiolol (group LB), and a control group without beta-blocker therapy (group C). The primary end point was the presence/absence of postoperative AF. Secondary end points were (1) the early clinical outcome, (2) hemodynamics, (3) cardiac enzymes (creatine kinase isoenzyme MB, troponin-I, and human <b>heart</b> <b>fatty</b> acid-binding protein), (4) high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) and pentraxin- 3, (5) asymmetric dimethylarginine (ADMA), and (6) brain natriuretic peptide. ResultsPostoperative AF occurred in 14. 5 % of group L, 9. 1 % of group LB, and 35. 3 % of group C. A significant difference was observed between groups LB and C.

Octanoate was a principal contributor to the acetyl-CoA pool in all tissues examined, with highest oxi-dation occurring in heart and soleus muscle followed by pre-dominantly red portion of gastrocnemius muscle (RG), liver, and then white portion of gastrocnemius muscle (WG). Frac-tional contribution of 13 C-labeled octanoate to the acetyl-CoA pool (Fc 2) was 0. 563 0. 066 for heart and 0. 367 0. 054 for liver. Significant differences were observed between each of th...|$|R
40|$|Background Epidemiological and {{molecular}} findings suggest {{a relationship between}} Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and dyslipidemia, although {{the nature of this}} association is not well understood. Results Using linear mixed effects models, we investigated the relationship between CSF levels of <b>heart</b> <b>fatty</b> acid binding protein (HFABP), a lipid binding protein involved with fatty acid metabolism and lipid transport, amyloid-β (Aβ), phospho-tau, and longitudinal MRI-based measures of brain atrophy among 295 non-demented and demented older individuals. Across all participants, we found a significant association of CSF HFABP with longitudinal atrophy of the entorhinal cortex and other AD-vulnerable neuroanatomic regions. However, we found that the relationship between CSF HABP and brain atrophy was significant only among those with low CSF Aβ 1 – 42 and occurred irrespective of phospho-tau 181 p status. Conclusions Our findings indicate that Aβ-associated volume loss occurs in the presence of elevated HFABP irrespective of phospho-tau. This implicates a potentially important role for fatty acid binding proteins in Alzheimer’s disease neurodegeneration...|$|R
40|$|AbstractVariations in the {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of lipids {{in the heart}} alter its function and susceptibility to ischaemic injury. We investigated the effect of sex and dietary fat intake on the fatty acid composition of phospholipids and triacylglycerol in rat heart. Rats were fed either 40 or 100 g/kg fat (9 : 1 lard:soybean oil) from weaning until day 105. There were significant interactive effects of sex and fat intake on the proportions of <b>fatty</b> acids in <b>heart</b> phospholipids, dependent on phospholipid classes. 20 : 4 n- 6, but not 22 : 6 n- 3, was higher in phospholipids in females than males fed a low, but not a high, fat diet. There was no effect of sex on the composition of triacylglycerol. These findings suggest that sex {{is an important factor}} in determining the incorporation of dietary fatty acids into cardiac lipids. This may have implications for sex differences in susceptibility to heart disease...|$|R

It has been pointed out protective effect and beneficial effects of these <b>fatty</b> acids on <b>heart</b> health, cardiovascular disease (CVD), blood lipid profile, Type 2 Diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM), inflammatory and renal diseases and other illnesses [1, 2]. Other potential mechanisms of cardiovascular protection by EPA/DHA may include lowering blood pressure, reduced anti-inflammatory effects, improved insulin resistance and decrease oxidative stress [3, 4]. Most of these signs and illnesses are related to meta-bolic syndrome (MS). MS is defined as the presence of at least three of the five cardiovascular disease risk fac-tors in the following list: elevated fasting triglycerides (TG), decreased high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, in-sulin resistance, abdominal obesity and high blood pres-sure [3, 5]. Accordingly nutritional modifications such a...|$|R
40|$|Elsevier Ltd. High meat {{quality is}} {{required}} for dry-cured ham production, which quality depends on meat fat quantity and composition. The aim was to study the polymorphisms of six genes involved in fat metabolism, namely, Stearoyl-CoA desaturase (SCD), Diacylglycerol acyltransferase 1 and 2 (DGAT 1 & DGAT 2), Microsomal triglyceride transfer protein (MTTP), Fatty acid synthase (FASN) and <b>Heart</b> <b>fatty</b> acid binding protein (H-FABP) in two traditional (Large White or Duroc. ×. (Landrace×Large White)) and two industrial hybrids (Goland and Danbred), which are used for dry-cured ham production. Significant associations of SCD and MTTP were found with carcass weight. DGAT 2 was associated with back fat thickness and L* fat colour (objective white colour score). Several genes (DGAT 2, MTTP & FASN) were associated with weight loss during salting, first step in dry-cured ham production, affecting final yield. Finally, MTTP was associated with shear force. Our {{findings suggest that the}} SCD, DGAT 2, MTTP and FASN polymorphisms are associated with quality of heavy pig meat products...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that long chain acyl carnitine accumulates in ischemic myocardium, and L-carnitine prevents ventricular arrhythmias as well as the accumulation of long chain acyl carnitine in ischemic and free <b>fatty</b> acid supplemented <b>hearts.</b> The {{purpose of this study was}} to observe the electrophysiological effects of long chain acyl carnitine, and to evaluate the protective effect of L-carnitine on the transmembrane action potential impaired by long chain acyl carnitine. Using standard microelectrode techniques, transmembrane action potentials were recorded from isolated canine papillary muscle. Palmitoyl carnitine (0. 3 mM and 0. 6 mM) decreased the resting membrane potential, action potential amplitude and maximum upstroke velocity of phase 0, and shortened action potential duration and effective refractory period in a concentration-dependent manner. Application of L-carnitine (25 mM) prevented the effect of palmitoyl carnitine (0. 3 mM) on the transmembrane action potential. These results suggest that long chain acyl carnitine plays an important role in arrhythmogenesis, and that the effect is prevented by L-carnitine...|$|R
