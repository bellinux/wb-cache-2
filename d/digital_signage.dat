5|$|Cedar Lane Cinema {{had been}} the township's lone movie theater, and had also hosted live {{performances}} on its stage by local performance groups, until it closed its doors in November 2012, with theater operator Majestic Entertainment citing costs that could run {{to as much as}} $500,000 to modernize the projection systems on all four screens to use digital technology rather than 35mm reels of film. New owner Matthew Latten signed a lease in April 2013 and undertook extensive renovations that included new seating, modern digital projection systems and <b>digital</b> <b>signage.</b> After hosting the Teaneck International Film Festival in November, the reopening of the renamed Teaneck Cineams was delayed until December 2013, with added time needed to complete the work needed to add modern features and conveniences while retaining the Art Deco character of a theater first constructed in 1937.|$|E

40|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>signages</b> are {{increasingly}} common for out-of-home advertising. Latest advancements in smartphones, wireless communication and displays {{make it possible}} to design smarter interactive signage systems for more effective advertising. Although existing research have started a trend of cyber-physical interactions, they are generally not scalable for multiple users and not intuitive to interact with. Smart Signage - a "draggable" cyber-physical broadcast/multicast (B/M) media system is therefore proposed here. With a novel cyber-physical B/M protocol that enables a display concurrently interacting with physical actions of multiple user smartphones, a large number of users can simultaneously acquire any running content on a display by simply using an intuitive "dragging" hand gesture with their smartphones. Analytical formulations are derived to identify the key parameters and their dynamics in the system, which provide the condition for achieving the average response time of a user "dragging" gesture within 1 second limit. Implementations are demonstrated for possible real-world deployments. Experiments with 30 primary students are conducted to prove the system offering scalable and intuitive interactions for the first-time users even when they are moving. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{envisions a}} public space {{populated}} with active visible surfaces which appear different to a camera {{than to the}} human eye. Thus, they can act as general digital interfaces that transmit machine-compatible data {{as well as provide}} relative orientation without being obtrusive. We introduce a personal transceiver peripheral, and demonstrate this visual environment enables human participants to hear sound only from the location they are looking in, authenticate with proximal surfaces, and gather otherwise imperceptible data from an object in sight. We present a design methodology that assumes the availability of many independent and controllable light transmitters where each individual transmitter produces light at different color wavelengths. Today, controllable light transmitters take the form of <b>digital</b> billboards, <b>signage</b> and overhead lighting built for human use; light-capturing receivers take the form of mobile cameras and personal video camcorders. Following the software-defined approach, we leverage screens and cameras as parameterized hardware peripherals thus allowing flexibility and development of the proposed framework on general-purpose computers {{in a manner that is}} unobtrusive to humans. We develop VRCodes which display spatio-temporally modulated metamers on active screens thus conveying digital and positional information to a rolling-shutter camera; and physically-modified optical setups which encode data in a point-spread function thus exploiting the camera's wide-aperture. These techniques exploit how the camera sees something different from the human. We quantify the full potential of the system by characterizing basic bounds of a parameterized transceiver hardware along with the medium in which it operates. Evaluating performance highlights the underutilized temporal, spatial and frequency dimensions available to the interaction designer concerned with human perception. Results suggest that the one-way point-to-point transmission is good enough for extending the techniques toward a two-way bidrectional model with realizable hardware devices. The new visual environment contains a second data layer for machines that is synthetic and quantifiable; human interactions serve as the context. by Grace Woo. Thesis (Ph. D.)
