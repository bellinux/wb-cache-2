25|$|The {{most popular}} {{theory of the}} subgenre's christening is Possessed's 1984 demo, Death Metal; the song from the eponymous demo would also be {{featured}} on the band's 1985 debut album, Seven Churches. Possessed vocalist/bassist Jeff Becerra said he coined the term in early 1983 for a <b>high</b> <b>school</b> <b>English</b> class assignment. Another possible origin was a magazine called Death Metal, started by Thomas Fischer and Martin Ain of Hellhammer and Celtic Frost. The name was later given to the 1984 compilation Death Metal released by Noise Records. The term might also have originated from other recordings, such as the demo released by Death in 1984, called Death by Metal.|$|E
