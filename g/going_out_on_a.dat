5|$|The {{flashback}} jumps {{forward to}} April's time at Fairdale Residential School. She befriends Poppy, who has Asperger syndrome. In the present, Marion buys a mobile phone for April. Back at Fairdale, April is being taught by Miss Bean (Marion). A {{piece of work}} on family trees leads to the pair fighting. At night, April tries to escape the school to find Gina, but is caught by Marion, who sends her back. Marion reads April's records, and, having learnt of her history, apologises for the family tree incident. Banned from <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Saturday with her peers, April is instead taken to the stately home by Marion. A present-day Marion goes alone to her house, to find {{that there are no}} messages on the phone. The younger Marion introduces April to Elliot as they continue to visit the home. The present-day Marion goes to April's room, and looks in April's box, which contains mementos from different times in her life. The younger April and Marion walk through the home's garden, and Marion tells April she is leaving Fairdale. April becomes angry, thinking that Marion, like others before her, is now going to leave her life. Marion invites April to move in with her, and she accepts. When shown around her new bedroom, April's first concern is to have somewhere to put her box. The present April considers returning to Marion, but realises there is another place she wants to visit. It occurs to Marion where April will be going, and she drives away from her house. April goes to the street where she was found as a baby, and stands among the bins. Marion opens April's mobile and rings Reno's, the pizza parlour. April then notices a phone number {{on the side of a}} dustbin. Marion asks for directions to the pizza parlour, while April dials the number she found. It is not her mother who answers, as she hoped, but Frankie, the pizza boy who found her. She meets Frankie in the pizza parlour, and Marion arrives. April explains who Frankie is, and Marion gives April her new phone. The three sit down together. A voice-over from April says that, though she will probably never know her birth mother, she has a mother in Marion, and this is just the beginning.|$|E

500|$|Written by Lauren Faust and Tim McKeon, [...] "Destination: Imagination" [...] was {{directed}} by Rob Renzetti and series creator Craig McCracken. The plot was conceived after the crew decided {{that they wanted to}} make an episode with adventure, featuring the characters <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> large quest of sorts.

Two rows of men face one another, clapping, singing, and dancing in a lively manner, accompanied by large frame drums. At the peak of the dance two swordsmen perform a duel between the rows of dancers. The Assyrian minority in Syria have a dramatic folk dance called the Shora which commemorates the bloody battles fought by the Ancient Assyrians back in their time consisting of a leader (usually a man) in front with a sword otherwise known as a saypa and a line of men joining together. Generally speaking, a number of dances (also known as razfah or ayyala) of Bedouin origin use weapons and have achieved modern popularity in the Arab states of the Persian Gulf and are associated with festive occasions among the non-Bedouin sedentary population.|$|E

The song, written by Matchbox Twenty frontman Rob Thomas, became <b>a</b> hit <b>on</b> adult contemporary radio, spending two weeks at number 1 on the Billboard Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart. It also reached number 5 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart, the band's second best-ranking song at this moment, preceded by the single [...] "Bent" [...] from the same album. [...] Rob Thomas never dreamed of the song <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>an</b> album, let alone being a huge success.

[...] Rebecca Twomey of Marie Claire said that the group is [...] "on key with the current trend for dance music with their new song," [...] while noting that they have [...] "clearly taken inspiration from Cheryl's Call My Name." [...] Katy Brand of The Daily Telegraph was critical towards the song. Brand said that the lyrics [...] "are the usual post-Spice fare," [...] but commented that [...] "the images weren't quite matching the words.

She also praised the character of Curtis, stating that he was [...] "adorable". Of the storyline she said, [...] "The actual murder by electrocution was an interesting twist and one I didn't see coming. I was happy to see Bud jump in and read the murderer her rights before she said anything further. That certainly seemed like something a detective should do". She finished in saying that she [...] "enjoyed" [...] the song played at the end of the episode, 'Maybe' by Ingrid Michaelson [...] "was both cheery and melancholy enough to fit the moment".

500|$|The episode {{received}} varied {{reviews from}} critics and viewers. Reviewers generally disliked the episode's humor, but were {{positive about the}} more serious moments. Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club believed that the show's concept, which allowed only two characters and a single scene, was [...] "ambitious" [...] but that the end result was [...] "flaccid." [...] He commented that with no cut-away gags or side plots, the episode was [...] "basically everything critics of the show would like the show to have" [...] but was deprived of Family Guys trademark fast pace and reduced to [...] "a series of what amounts to grossout comedy sketches." [...] Television critic Ramsey Isler of IGN added that the gross-out humor [...] "didn't work for me" [...] and found the [...] "more serious stuff" [...] in the episode {{to be the most}} entertaining. Said Isler, [...] "the addition of more dramatic themes and the elimination of the cutaway gags really showed what this show could be if Seth [...] and team put more effort in." [...] In a subsequent review of Family Guys eighth season, Isler listed [...] "Brian & Stewie" [...] as being [...] "surprisingly dramatic," [...] and, [...] "had {{it not been for the}} extended poop-eating jokes and rehashed musical numbers in the second half, I'd say it was one of the better efforts the show has ever put out." [...] Jason Hughes of TV Squad was also [...] "more than a little disturbed" [...] by the amount of time spent on Stewie's soiled diaper. However, he noted, [...] "I didn't laugh much at 'Brian & Stewie', but I found myself absolutely captured by their discussion throughout the episode." [...] Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly described the episode as [...] "tedious, predictably vulgar, and, by the end, sentimental." [...] Adam Rosenberg of MTV wrote, [...] "Beneath all of the more disturbing elements there's actually some very thoughtful, mature discussion of suicide and what love means amidst it all." [...] Andrew Hanson of The Los Angeles Times found the soiled diaper gag [...] "too sick to watch" [...] and [...] "the grossest" [...] moment featured in Family Guy so far, but conceded that that may have been the producer's intention. Still, Hanson described Brian's suicidal confession as [...] "deep" [...] and stated, [...] "It’s nice to see that Family Guy is still trying new things and <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> limb even at episode No. 150." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number seven on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] and said he [...] "loved" [...] this episode due its feature of Brian and Stewie's relationship. He added that the episode was [...] "particularly great" [...] because it featured no cutaway gags and was a two-hander, noting that [...] "Clearly, the writers know exactly what the fans want." ...|$|E

It's not my idea of what the show should be. It's embarrassing to me if I am not the star of it and in the way I feel it should be. This year should be more important to it, not less important to it... I might as well work less hard in all of them." [...] Johnny Byrne said that Freiberger was a good man and good producer, but not good for Space: 1999. He had gotten them a second year after the cancellation, but the changes he made did not benefit the programme.|$|E

2500|$|Leaving {{his wife}} and son, Clark began {{the first of his}} diaries a month before the First Fleet {{departed}} Portsmouth, on 13 May 1787. The writing in the diaries is very personal and informal, and was never intended for publication. Clark was extremely homesick, and longed to see {{his wife and}} son, writing as early as {{the second day of the}} voyage: [...] "Oh my God all my hoppes [...] are over of seeing my beloved wife and son". Like many of his fellow officers, he was aggrieved at the level of comfort and support offered to the convicts, noting [...] "I believe few Marines or Soldiers <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> foreign Service under Government were ever better, if so well provided for as these Convicts are". On arrival in Botany Bay, Clark was dismayed at the unsuitable conditions, which were far from what had been promised in England: [...] "if we are obliged to settle here there will not a soul be alive in the course of a year". With the site for settlement subsequently moved to Sydney Cove, Clark remained distressed by the living conditions experienced by himself and his fellow officers, expressing in a letter to his family in England: [...] "I never slept worse, my dear wife, than I did last night, what with the hard cold ground, spiders, ants and every vermin you can think of was crawling over me". During the colony's early years, little food was produced, and the rations brought from England were soon consumed, leaving the colony in near starvation. Clark wrote [...] "God help us. If some ships dont [...] arrive, I dont know what will". Supplies finally arrived in June 1790, on Lady Juliana.|$|E
2500|$|In {{order to}} adapt Pettibon's artwork {{to meet the}} layout {{requirements}} of their albums and flyers, the members of Black Flag would alter it by cutting and pasting and adding their name, logo, and gig details to it. They would then make photocopies and put up dozens of flyers to promote their shows. Rollins recalls <b>going</b> <b>out</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> flyering mission with roadie Mugger in 1981 in which the pair would put a layer of paste onto a telephone pole, stick up the flyer, and then cover it with an additional coat of paste {{so that it would}} last for up to a year. The band members and their crew would do this for miles around, using dozens of flyers to promote a single performance. Pettibon, however, did not always appreciate the band's treatment of his art, which he provided to them largely for free. [...] "To me my work was the equivalent of a band like Black Flag or any other band who was righteously self-protective of recordings. I would give them original art and it would come back to me scrawled upon and taped over or whited out, and I'd always ask nicely, 'Could you please make a copy of this first and then do that?' Their master tapes were deemed sacrosanct, while my work was seen as completely disposable, but I'm not venting or complaining, just stating fact." [...] Pettibon also felt pigeonholed by his association with the band, and had a falling out with them in 1985 over artwork used {{on the cover of the}} Loose Nut album, which had been used for a flyer several years earlier. Ginn resurrected it without telling his brother and turned it over to drummer Bill Stevenson to do the layout, who cut it into pieces and used them as elements for the cover and lyric sheet. Pettibon became irate and he and Ginn stopped speaking for some time, though his artwork continued to be used for the remainder of the band's career.|$|E
