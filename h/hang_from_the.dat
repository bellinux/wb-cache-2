5|$|Hydnellum peckii is an {{inedible}} (though not toxic) fungus, and {{a member}} of the genus Hydnellum of the family Bankeraceae. It is a hydnoid species, producing spores on the surface of vertical spines or tooth-like projections that <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> undersurface of the fruit bodies. It is found in North America, Europe, and was recently discovered in Iran (2008) and Korea (2010). Hydnellum peckii is a mycorrhizal species, and forms mutually beneficial relationships with a variety of coniferous trees, growing on the ground singly, scattered, or in fused masses.|$|E

5|$|Turkeys {{are large}} birds, their nearest {{relatives}} being the pheasant and the guineafowl. Males {{are larger than}} females and have spreading, fan-shaped tails and distinctive, fleshy wattles, called a snood, that <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top of the beak and are used in courtship display. Wild turkeys can fly, but seldom do so, preferring to run with a long, stratling gait. They roost in trees and forage on the ground, feeding on seeds, nuts, berries, grass, foliage, invertebrates, lizards, and small snakes.|$|E
5|$|The Nobu Restaurant {{features}} an Asian motif and is spaciously arranged with only round tables, granting larger aisles than square tables would. Large paper lamps in jellyfish images <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ceiling. Seating {{is available in}} the main dining area, the sushi bar, along a couple of high kitchen tables, or in a private dining area. There are also two teppanyaki grill tables, which serve as either a traditional grill or in combination with the menu and dishes from the main kitchen. In addition to chef Nobu Matsuhisa's signature dishes featuring black cod in miso sauce, rock shrimp tempura, and yellowtail sashimi the menu has variations on the dishes which are not available at other Nobu restaurants, as well as an exclusive list of sakes available nowhere else in the U.S.|$|E
5|$|During {{a couple}} of the Svea flights, Andrée tested and tried out the drag-rope {{steering}} technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> balloon basket and drag part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of lighter-than-air craft to travel at the same speed as the wind, a situation that makes steering by sails impossible. The friction of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon {{to the point where the}} sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andrée reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction. This notion is rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andrée's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken, being misled by inexpertise and a surfeit of enthusiasm in an environment of variable winds and poor visibility. Use of drag ropes (prone to snapping, falling off, or becoming entangled with each other or the ground, in addition to being ineffective) is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful steering technique.|$|E

25|$|The German {{physician}} Gottlob Schober (1670-1739), {{who worked}} in Russia from 1712, notes that a person could <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ribs for about three days prior to expiring, his primary pain being that of extreme thirst. He thought this degree of insensitivity was something peculiar to the Russian mentality.|$|E

25|$|In the US, the White House began marking World AIDS Day {{with the}} iconic display of a 28-foot AIDS Ribbon on the building's North Portico in 2007.

25|$|Cowell also {{features}} {{a wide variety of}} annual events and programs. For example, residential staff has in the past hosted a series of events each year known as the Cowell Olympics.

25|$|Paixtles {{is one of}} the few pre Hispanic dances {{to remain}} free from European influence, mostly {{performed}} in Jalisco and Nayarit. Participants cover themselves with the moss that hangs from Montezuma Cypress trees and carry staves which have the head of a deer at one end. They accompany themselves with maracas that they carry. Dancers wear masks to cover the face and ribbons that <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> head.|$|E
25|$|In M. mexicanus, replete workers develop {{from the}} largest {{workers in the}} colony. In fact, if the repletes are removed from a colony, the next largest workers quickly become repletes. Typical workers and callows can develop into repletes in about two weeks. Other workers feed the {{developing}} repletes with plant nectar collected in the evenings. The repletes become so swollen that they become immobile, and <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> ceilings of dome chambers in the underground nest.|$|E
25|$|The {{matrices}} have {{a pattern}} of teeth at the top, by which they <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> distributor bar. Some of the teeth are cut away; which pattern of teeth is cut away depends on the character on the matrix; i.e.,which channel in the magazine it belongs in. Similarly, teeth are cut away along portions of the distributor bar. The bar on the elevator has all teeth, so it will hold any matrix (but not the space bands, which have no teeth at all).|$|E
50|$|Two {{black men}} were lynched on the bridge: Alfred Blount on February 14, 1893, was <b>hanged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> first span for {{allegedly}} attacking a white woman; Ed Johnson on March 19, 1906, was <b>hanged</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> second span, also for allegedly attacking a white woman.

25|$|To {{open the}} old exoskeleton, the spider {{generally}} contracts its abdomen (opisthosoma) to supply enough fluid to pump into the prosoma with sufficient pressure to crack it open along its lines of weakness. The carapace lifts {{off from the}} front, like a helmet, as its surrounding skin ruptures, but it remains attached at the back. Now the spider works its limbs free and typically winds up dangling by a new thread of silk attached to its own exuviae, which in turn <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> original silk attachment.|$|E
25|$|Protopolybia exigua is {{a species}} of vespid wasp found in South America and Southern Brazil. These neotropical wasps, of the tribe Epiponini, form large colonies with {{multiple}} queens per colony. P. exigua are small wasps that find nourishment from nectar and prey on arthropods. Their nests are disc-shaped and <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> undersides of leaves and tree branches. This particular species of wasp {{can be hard to}} study because they frequently abandon their nests. P. exigua continuously seek refuge from phorid fly attacks and thus often flee infested nests to build new ones. The wasps’ most common predators are ants and the parasitoid phorid flies from the Phoridae family.|$|E
25|$|Strachan Hall is {{the largest}} {{component}} of the western wing, serving as the central dining hall for students residing in the main building, and the venue of all regular formal High Table dinners, now regularly held on Wednesday evenings. Adorning {{the walls of the}} Strachan Hall are portraits of important figures {{in the history of the}} college. The largest portraits, which <b>hang</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> north wall, are of Bishop Strachan and George Whitaker, the college's first provost from 1852 to 1880. Hanging on the front wall prominently behind the High Table is a large mediaeval tapestry, believed to have been woven in Flanders in the fourteenth century to depict the coming of the Queen of Sheba to the court of King Solomon.|$|E
