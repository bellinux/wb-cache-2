5|$|Lunars English {{version was}} handled by Working Designs, a small California-based {{publisher}} {{who had previously}} localized smaller games for the TurboGrafx-16 and TurboDuo. Their biggest project yet, the team, headed by company {{vice president and chief}} writer Victor Ireland, took to the project seriously, often collaborating with the original Japanese team themselves. New gameplay elements were often added at Ireland's request, including new sequences such as playing Alex's harp to awaken Luna {{near the end of the}} game. Working Designs also put <b>extra</b> <b>effort</b> into the game's packaging, giving the instruction booklet embossed lettering, and having seven separate stamps, each with different artwork, produced for the front of the game discs to increase collection value.|$|E
5|$|The couple put <b>extra</b> <b>effort</b> into {{avoiding}} {{the issues that}} had caused strife before their separation: Despite being an indifferent cook and housekeeper, Green {{tried to focus on}} cooking and keeping the new house cleaner, while Farrar vowed to curtail his work hours so that he could spend more time with the family. The improvements lasted mere months, however, {{and by the end of}} 1994, both Green and Farrar had fallen back to their old habits and the marriage was again floundering. Fearful of another confrontation with Green, and looking forward to a trip to Peru the family had planned for June 1995, Farrar nevertheless decided to wait until after the trip to raise the issue of a divorce again.|$|E

5|$|Breslin married Jami Rutili, and {{the couple}} had three children, Shane, Paige, and Chase. He {{earned a degree in}} {{recreation}} management while at Lake Superior State. During his career, Breslin was involved in numerous charities. He delivered food on Thanksgiving for the Chris Zorich Foundation; conducted self-esteem workshops for an anti-drug, anti-gang organization; participated in the Wolves' Read to Succeed program, in which he read to children at local libraries; and several others. In a 1997 interview, Breslin said that the most special charity he helped was one started by him and his wife. The <b>Extra</b> <b>Effort</b> program was started at Indian Trail Junior High School in Addison, where Jami was a teacher. Each month the program gave both a male and a female student four tickets to a Wolves game and a gift bag. The students were chosen based on attitude, effort and attendance. After retiring from professional hockey, he coached youth hockey and helped manage an Irish pub.|$|E
5|$|Leeds {{struggled}} in the 1961–62 season, as aside from Billy Bremner and Jack Charlton his playing squad {{was filled with}} journeymen pros; he did though inherit a good coaching staff that included Les Cocker, Maurice Lindley and Syd Owen who would all spend many years with Revie at Leeds. He developed a youth policy at the club, notable graduates {{of which would be}} Eddie Gray, Norman Hunter, Peter Lorimer and Paul Reaney. He had a difficult task in persuading young players to join Leeds over more glamorous clubs but made sure he put in <b>extra</b> <b>effort</b> to make the youngsters feel happy at Leeds, and in one instance drove to Scotland to talk to Bremner's girlfriend to successfully persuade her to encourage Bremner to stay at Leeds rather than return to Scotland to be with her. Revie played his last game in March 1962 before concentrating entirely on management.|$|E
5|$|The first submarine, , {{was laid}} down in February 1990. Collins launch was {{originally}} planned for 1994, but was later set for 28 August 1993. Although launched on schedule, she was not complete: {{the design of the}} submarine had not been finalised, important internal pipes and fittings were not installed, the components of the combat system had yet to be delivered, and some hull sections were actually sheets of timber painted black so the submarine would appear complete in photographs of the launching ceremony. Within weeks of the launch, Collins was removed from the water, and it was not until June 1994 that the submarine was completed. Progress on the other five submarines was delayed by the <b>extra</b> <b>effort</b> required to meet Collins launching date and the subsequent work to complete her. Collins was not commissioned into the RAN until 27 July 1996; eighteen months behind schedule, because of several delays and problems, most relating to the provision and installation of the combat data system software. Collins was not approved for operational deployments until 2000.|$|E
40|$|This study uses {{a survey}} of a large sample {{of public and private}} sector {{employees}} in Tucson, Arizona, to reveal the determinants of employee <b>extra</b> work <b>effort.</b> <b>Extra</b> work <b>effort</b> is defined as those actions benefitting their employer performed by employees for which employees are not explicitly compensated. The current literature suggests employee empowerment through the variation of personnel systems to allow for greater employee responsibility and decision-making as a powerful determinant of employee <b>extra</b> work <b>effort.</b> The finding of this research suggests that while the implementation of these personnel systems may increase other positive occupational traits, such as job satisfaction and employee interest, no direct connection can be made between employee empowerment managerial systems and employee <b>extra</b> work <b>effort.</b> Instead, organizational commitment is a more robust determinant of employee <b>extra</b> work <b>effort.</b> Implications of these findings are suggested for the current literature and practical application...|$|R

5|$|In 1896, Yorkshire {{won their}} second County Championship. Hirst hit a century against Leicestershire and nine other scores over fifty; this {{improvement}} in his batting took him past 1,000 {{runs for the}} first time, and his average of 28.05 was substantially higher than he had achieved previously. With the ball he took 104 wickets, at the more expensive average of 21.61, to complete the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets for the first time. However, some critics in Yorkshire were unhappy that his batting had improved, believing that the <b>extra</b> <b>effort</b> involved would diminish his effectiveness as a bowler. They considered a powerful bowling attack to be vital to the team's success, more so than a strong batting line-up, and expressed the opinion that Hirst should concentrate on one discipline rather than dividing his energy. Over the next few seasons, these fears were proven to some extent, Wisden noting in 1901 {{that he was a}} less effective bowler than previously. In 1897, Hirst completed the double again. He scored 1,535 runs at an average of 35.69, with a century and 11 fifties, and took 101 wickets at an average of 23.22. These performances were good enough to earn him selection for the Players against the Gentlemen in the prestigious matches at The Oval and Lord's, in both of which he scored half-centuries.|$|E

25|$|Strengthen team cohesion: The {{extent to}} which group members {{identify}} with their group also determines the amount of social loafing. This concept links with social identity theory in that that difference between a hard-working group {{and one that is}} loafing is the match between the group’s tasks and its members’ self definitions. When individuals derive their sense of self and identity from their membership, social loafing is replaced by social laboring (members will expand <b>extra</b> <b>effort</b> for their group).|$|E

25|$|Although such {{techniques}} were not widely used by commercial interpreters, they exemplify the language's best survival mechanism: not specifying {{the order of}} scalar operations or the exact contents of memory.

25|$|Solving such {{problems}} {{is actually an}} easy task and it is simply to avoid using ASCII format and use binary format instead.

50|$|Unfamiliarity with {{country club}} manners also made Casals feel {{different}} from the other players.

25|$|There {{is also a}} {{link between}} the hopping action and breathing: as the feet leave the ground, air is {{expelled}} from the lungs; bringing the feet forward ready for landing refills the lungs, providing further energy efficiency. Studies of kangaroos and wallabies have demonstrated, beyond the minimum energy expenditure required to hop at all, increased speed requires very little <b>extra</b> <b>effort</b> (much less than the same speed increase in, say, a horse, dog or human), and the extra energy is required to carry extra weight. For kangaroos, the key benefit of hopping is not speed to escape predators—the top speed of a kangaroo is no higher than that of a similarly sized quadruped, and the Australian native predators are in any case less fearsome than those of other countries—but economy: in an infertile country with highly variable weather patterns, the ability of a kangaroo to travel long distances at moderately high speed in search of food sources is crucial to survival.|$|E

She took a full course load and participated in many extracurricular activities; after graduation she applied to and was accepted by the University of Chicago for a masters in social work. Compared to the best professional male players who dedicate their lives to chess, Hou's split focus puts her as a disadvantage, {{and as a consequence}} her results against them have been lackluster. These competitors give her credit for what she has achieved in spite of her lack of preparation, and for her life outside of chess.
