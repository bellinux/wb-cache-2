5|$|On September 11, 2012, the U.S. {{diplomatic}} mission in Benghazi, Libya, was attacked, {{resulting in the}} deaths of the U.S. Ambassador, J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans. The attack, questions surrounding the security of the U.S. consulate and the varying explanations given afterward by administration officials <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened became politically controversial in the U.S. On October 15, Clinton took responsibility for the question of security lapses and said the differing explanations were due to the inevitable fog of war confusion after such events.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously, {{public opinion}} polls during {{the second week of}} May showed that 50 percent of the American public {{approved}} of President Nixon's actions. Fifty-eight percent blamed the students <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> occurred at Kent State. On both sides, emotions ran high. In one instance, in New York City on 8 May, pro-administration construction workers rioted and attacked demonstrating students. Such violence, however, was an aberration. Most demonstrations, both pro- and anti-war, were peaceful. On 20 May 100,000 construction workers, tradesmen, and office workers marched peacefully through New York City in support of the president's policies.|$|E
5|$|He {{remained}} at the club as a player but was rarely selected for the team, and in January 2005, he went on loan to Hull City, where he was reunited once again with Peter Taylor. He made ten appearances for Hull, who gained promotion to the Football League Championship (the new name <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> been previously been called the First Division), while Gillingham were relegated from the same division. He returned to the Gillingham team {{at the start of}} the 2005–06 season and made a further 17 appearances, the final one in a 3–0 home win against Port Vale on 10 December 2005. At forty years and four months of age, he was the oldest player ever to represent the club. He rounded out his Gillingham career by returning to Priestfield Stadium for a testimonial match in July 2006. He is widely regarded as a club legend by Gillingham fans, who in 2005 voted him the team's best ever player in a local radio poll, and he was also named Gillingham's greatest ever player by the Professional Footballers' Association in November 2007.|$|E

25|$|The {{developing}} scandal led to inquiries into {{practices at}} the BBC and the National Health Service. It was alleged that rumours of Savile's activities had circulated at the BBC in the 1960s and 1970s, but no action had been taken. The Director-General of the BBC, George Entwistle, apologised <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened, and on 16 October 2012 appointed former High Court judge Dame Janet Smith {{to review the}} culture and practices of the BBC during the time Savile worked there, and Nick Pollard, a former Sky News executive, was appointed to look at why the Newsnight investigation into Savile's activities was dropped shortly before transmission in December 2011.|$|E
25|$|The LeSabre {{nameplate}} {{made its}} first appearance on the 1951 Le Sabre show car, which introduced the world to aircraft-inspired design elements such as the wrap-around windshield and tail fins. There is a V12 for the Buick LeSabre (5.00L) which originated in 1953. In 1959 LeSabre became the new moniker <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> previously been known as the Buick Special. The Buick LeSabre was offered in a full line of body styles except between 1965-1969 when its station wagon variant was dropped from Buick's full-size offerings. In 1977, the LeSabre was downsized along with other GM full-size models, and was available only in pillared coupe, sedan and wagon body styles.|$|E
25|$|After Armstrong's single {{unsuccessful}} {{appearance as}} an amateur in 1919, he disappeared into club cricket in Loughborough, but in 1924 he re-emerged in a single match as an all-rounder as Leicestershire entered its second team in the Minor Counties competition, though he was injured in the game. The establishment of a second team in the Minor Counties {{was part of a}} series of moves intended to produce a stronger team <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> traditionally been one of the weaker English counties; the moves included the appointment of the club's first full-time coach, the former Surrey and England player Ernie Hayes, and the recruitment of new professionals. Armstrong was cited then and later as a player who had benefited from this coaching and the more professional set-up.|$|E

25|$|On 8 October, the Director-General of the BBC, George Entwistle, apologised <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> {{happened}} and said further internal investigations would take place. The {{chairman of the}} BBC Trust, Lord Patten, said the investigation would be set up as soon as police enquiries had been completed, and would be chaired by a figure from outside the BBC. As {{a result of the}} shelving of the Newsnight investigation into Savile's activities (see above), there were complaints on Newswatch. On 11 October 2012, the Director-General asked BBC Scotland director Ken MacQuarrie to look into staff concerns over the dropping of the item. He announced a review of BBC policy on child protection, and an enquiry into its culture and practices, focusing on the years Savile worked there.|$|E
25|$|The attack, and {{questions}} surrounding the U.S. Government's preparedness for it, and explanations <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened afterward, became a political firestorm in the U.S., {{especially in the}} context of the ongoing presidential election. The State Department had previously identified embassy and personnel security as a major challenge in its budget and priorities report. On the September 20, Clinton gave a classified briefing to U.S. Senators, which several Republican attendees criticized, angry at the Obama administration's rebuff of their attempts to learn details of the Benghazi attack, only to see that information published the next day in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal. She did announce the formation of an Accountability Review Board panel, chaired by longtime diplomat Thomas R. Pickering and vice-chaired by retired Admiral and former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Michael Mullen, to investigate the attack from the State Department's viewpoint.|$|E
25|$|It was in {{fact the}} {{reaction}} in London which was fiercest in condemnation of the war. By the Edwardian period, colonial wars had become increasingly unpopular, and public and political opinion were unhappy with the waging of a war for such slight reasons as those provided by Curzon, and with the beginning battle, which was described in Britain as something of a deliberate massacre of unarmed men. It was only the support given to them by King Edward VII that secured Younghusband, Macdonald, Grant, and others the recognition due <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> been a remarkable feat of arms. Leading an army through remote, high-altitude terrain, fighting courageous defenders, enduring freezing weather in difficult positions, they achieved all their objectives in just six months, losing just 202 men to enemy action and 411 to other causes. Tibetan casualties have been estimated at between 2,000-3,000 killed or fatally wounded.|$|E

25|$|George Profous, a {{forester}} <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> by {{then become}} the state's Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) {{wrote in an}} early 1990s planning document that the aged, deteriorating tower should be dismantled and removed, not only due to its age but because, out of use, {{it was no longer}} permitted on state-owned Forest Preserve land, which New York's constitution requires be kept forever wild. Worried residents of Denning and the nearby hamlet of Claryville contacted the Catskill Center for Conservation and Development, a regional advocacy group, to see what they could do to save it, a development Profous had been hoping for. DEC's guidelines governing the use of the Forest Preserve do allow the retention of otherwise incompatible structures within it if they enhance the public's understanding of the Forest Preserve, and many visitors and past observers wrote about how seeing the vastness of the Catskill wildlands at once helped them appreciate the importance of protecting it.|$|E
25|$|Two {{official}} investigations {{were subsequently}} {{conducted by the}} British and the League of Nations's Mandatory Commission. The former, The Shaw Report, concluded that the incident on 23 August consisted of an attack by Arabs on Jews, but rejected {{the view that the}} riots had been premeditated. Al-Husseini certainly played an energetic role in Muslim demonstrations from 1928 onwards, but could not be held responsible for the August riots, even if he had 'a share in the responsibility for the disturbances'. He had nonetheless collaborated from the 23rd. of that month in pacifying rioters and reestablishing order. The worst outbreaks occurred in areas, Hebron, Safed, Jaffa, and Haifa where his Arab political adversaries were dominant. The root cause of the violent outbreaks lay in the fear of territorial dispossession. In a Note of Reservation, Mr. Harry Snell, who had apparently been swayed by Sir Herbert Samuel's son, Edwin Samuel states that, although he was satisfied that the Mufti was not directly responsible for the violence or had connived at it, he believed the Mufti was aware {{of the nature of the}} anti-Zionist campaign and the danger of disturbances. He therefore attributed to the Mufti a greater share of the blame than the official report had. The Dutch Vice-Chairman of the Permanent Mandates Commission, M. Van Rees, argued that 'the disturbances of August 1929, as well as the previous disturbances of a similar character, were, in brief, only a special aspect of the resistance offered everywhere in the East, with its traditional and feudal civilisation, to the invasion of a European civilisation introduced by a Western administration' but concluded that in his view 'the responsibility <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened must lie with the religious and political leaders of the Arabs'.|$|E

[...] They said that the riot [...] "forever made the match memorable {{in the annals of}} New South Wales cricket", and lamented the fact that [...] "rowdyism became rampant {{for the rest of the}} afternoon". The paper asked the {{question}} [...] "What will they say in England?" [...] Wisden condemned the unrest as a [...] "deplorably disgraceful affair" [...] and described the spectators as a [...] "rough and excited mob".

500|$|Initial White House {{explanations}} <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> happened varied, {{but generally}} characterized it {{as a series}} of mistakes made without bad intent and offered apologies to those affected. [...] President Clinton said that, [...] "It {{appears to have been a}} completely honest bureaucratic snafu." [...] However his Republican opponent in the ongoing 1996 presidential election, Senator Bob Dole, compared it to the enemies list kept by the Nixon administration. [...] Republicans made other charges, including that the White House was trying to dig up damaging information about Republicans in general and that the file transfer was motivated by a desire to slander Dale and other White House Travel Office officials in order to justify their dismissal.|$|E
500|$|The NSWCA pressed {{charges against}} {{two men who}} were charged with [...] "having participated in the disorder". Their President Richard Driver, who {{appeared}} for the prosecution, told the court that [...] "the inmates of the Pavilion who had initiated the disturbance, including a well-known bookmaker of Victoria {{who was at the}} time ejected, had had their fees of membership returned to them, and they would never again be admitted to the ground". The Sydney Morning Herald reported that the two men [...] "expressed regret <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>had</b> occurred, and pleaded guilty" [...] and [...] "the Bench fined them 40 shillings, and to pay 21 shillings professional costs of the court".Despite initial cynicism from journalists, the NSWCA announced a crackdown on betting on cricket matches, and it was reported that over the next 10 years, gambling at cricket matches in Sydney mainly died out.|$|E

[...] UGO.com placed their break-up on its list of the most horrible TV breakups.
