5|$|At home, Tzara's {{works were}} {{collected}} and edited by the Surrealist promoter Sașa Pană, who corresponded with him over several years. The first such edition saw print in 1934, and featured the 1913-1915 poems Tzara {{had left in}} Vinea's care. In 1928-1929, Tzara exchanged letters with his friend Jacques G.

5|$|Congress {{began the}} task of {{restoring}} federal coins to circulation in 1864 with a two-cent piece in bronze, and by authorizing a three-cent piece in copper-nickel the following year. In 1866, it authorized a five-cent piece in the latter alloy, the nickel, as {{it has come to}} be known. With the three-cent silver effectively replaced by base-metal pieces, it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>share</b> in the increased mintage of silver coins that began in 1868. The three-cent silver was struck at the rate of a few thousand per year into the 1870s.|$|E

5|$|However, not {{everyone}} {{was satisfied with}} the new liturgical and political directions of the AFM. Wessel's political ties led to the radicalization of younger black pastors, {{the loss of the}} majority of the English membership, and a major division of Afrikaner members who <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>share</b> his political views. These Afrikaners not only disagreed with Wessel politically but also with du Plessis liturgically. In 1958, they broke from the AFM and formed the Pentecostal Protestant Church.|$|E

5|$|John Sigismund, {{originally}} Roman Catholic, {{converted to}} Lutheranism {{before the end}} of 1562. However, debates between Lutheran and Calvinist theologians continued. John Sigismund appointed his court physician, Giorgio Biandrata (who as an Anti-Trinitarian <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>share</b> either the Lutheran or the Calvinist view) to head a synod to reconcile the Lutheran and the Calvinist clergymen, but their differences proved insuperable in April 1564.

Pyxis is a faint constellation, its three brightest stars—Alpha, Beta and Gamma Pyxidis—form a rough line.

5|$|The English court viewed John of Brittany as {{a trusted}} diplomat. He was a skilled negotiator, and his French {{connections}} were a useful asset. By 1307 {{he was also}} one of the kingdom's oldest earls. As the relationship between Edward II and his nobility deteriorated, Richmond remained loyal to the king; in 1309 he went on an embassy to Pope Clement V on behalf of Edward's favourite Piers Gaveston.

5|$|Writers for Poedjangga Baroe <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>share</b> {{a united}} {{political}} view and the magazine ostensibly stayed politically neutral. This stance was adopted {{to ensure the}} magazine did not fall afoul of the colonial government's censors and to protect contributors employed by the government.

5|$|Although Poedjangga Baroe {{writers were}} united by nationalism, they had {{different}} views on traditional culture.

Main contributors, including the founders, came from religious backgrounds ranging from near-secularism to orthodox Islam. Stemming from these conflicting cultural views, between September 1935 and June 1939, numerous polemics {{were published in the}} magazine, discussing the best course of action for Indonesian cultural development.|$|E
