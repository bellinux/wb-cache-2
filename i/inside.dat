5|$|An {{examination}} of the blood stains found <b>inside</b> 46Lower Belgrave Street demonstrated that Rivett had been attacked in the basement kitchen, while Lady Lucan had been attacked {{at the top of}} the basement stairs. The blood stains found <b>inside</b> the Ford Corsair were of the AB blood group; the report concluded that this might have been a mixture of blood from both women. Hair similar to Lady Lucan's was also found <b>inside</b> the car.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} year, he {{corrected}} the subgroups of Thyreophora. He placed Acanthopholididae, Stegosauridae and Ceratopsidae together <b>inside</b> the group. Five years later, he corrected {{the name of}} the family to Acanthopholidae, which is now the correct spelling. In the same publication, he also changed the genera included. He assigned Hylaeosaurus, Stegoceras, Struthiosaurus, and Troodon <b>inside</b> it but moved Stegopelta and Ankylosaurus into the family Ankylosauridae. Nopcsa then downgraded the phylogenetic rank of Acanthopholidae to make it a subfamily <b>inside</b> Nodosauridae. The clade was defined to include Ankylosaurus and Acanthopholinae. <b>Inside</b> Acanthopholinae he placed Acanthopholis, Hylaeosaurus, Rhodanosaurus, Struthiosaurus, and Troodon. Now considered as an artificial grouping, it was defined to include dinosaur taxa now considered to be polacanthids, a pachycephalosaur and Acanthopholis, a genus that is widely considered to be dubious. Acanthopholidae and Acanthopholinae are now dubious groups since the validity of Acanthopholis has changed.|$|E
40|$|<b>Insides</b> and {{essences}} {{are both}} critical concepts for appreciating {{the importance of}} non-obvious entities: neither are observable, both contrast with external appearances, and both can {{be more important than}} external appearances. The present research examined understandings of <b>insides</b> and essences in 3 - to 5 - year-old children. In Study 1, children were asked questions requiring them to think about both the <b>insides</b> and the outer appearances of a series of objects. In Study 2, children were tested on their understanding that <b>insides</b> are typically more important than outer surfaces for an object's identity and functioning. In Studies 3, 4, and 5, children were tested on their understanding of innate potential, a concept that reflects understanding of an inborn essence. Contrary to the traditional view of children as externalists (cf. Piaget, 1951), these studies demonstrate that by age 4 children have a firm grasp of the importance of both <b>insides</b> and essences. Even by age 3 children reason clearly about the inside- outside distinction. These results suggest that preschool children attend to non- obvious features and realize their privileged status. They may also indicate a more basic predisposition toward psychological essentialism in young children...|$|R

Prior to its release, the film underwent a test screening for children, due to concerns from executives that it would be too complex for younger audiences—a fear quelled when the audience reacted positively to the picture.|$|E

5|$|Nocturnal in habits, the tawny {{nurse shark}} tends {{to spend the day}} resting in piles of two dozen or more {{individuals}} <b>inside</b> caves or under ledges. At night, it is an active-swimming predator that uses a powerful suction force to extract prey from <b>inside</b> holes and crevices. The diet of this species consists mainly of octopus, though they also take other invertebrates, small bony fishes, and rarely sea snakes. It is aplacental viviparous, meaning the embryos hatch from egg capsules <b>inside</b> the mother. It is the only carpet shark in which the embryos are oophagous, feeding on eggs produced by the mother while <b>inside</b> the uterus. The litter size may be as small as one or two, based on the large size of near-term embryos.|$|E
