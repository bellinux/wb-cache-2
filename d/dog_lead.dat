Meanwhile, Ignite selected a bag-carrying attachment for bicycles, and a set of cat playhouses. While they sold to one of the main customers, they also focused on finding companies to pitch to on the second day, but made little sales as a result, with only Lorraine and Yasmina primarily contributing, and thus effectively lost the task.|$|E

Both Rubin and Gavin {{spent most of their}} careers in the video game industry developing games for publishers like Electronic Arts, Universal Interactive Studios and Sony Computer Entertainment America.

After selling Naughty Dog to Sony, Rubin focused on a comic book series called Iron and the Maiden before teaming up again with Gavin to venture into the web industry with Flektor. Jason Kay spent four years at Home Box Office, working as a consultant to the EVP of Business Development. They recruited former employee and then Naughty <b>Dog</b> <b>Lead</b> Programmer Scott Shumaker to lead the technology team along with Gavin. Ryan Evans joined shortly thereafter, spearheading product development. Flektor is based in Culver City, California.|$|E
40|$|The {{recovery}} {{achieved in}} a flotation {{process is a}} function of both the characteristics of the feed stream and the operating conditions within the flotation cell. In this paper, the flotation characteristics of the streams within the Red <b>Dog</b> <b>lead</b> cleaning circuit have been compared by floating each of them in a laboratory flotation cell keeping the operating conditions of each test constant. The results of these experiments have been compared both graphically and via the use of modelling techniques. This comparison shows both in a qualitative and quantitative manner that the inherent stream property which produces the resulting flotation behaviour can be assumed to be conserved around the Red <b>Dog</b> <b>lead</b> cleaning circuit. In other words, the total mass of each floatability component in the feed streams was shown to equal the total mass of that same floatability component in the product streams for each node in the process. Using these principles and a flotation modelling algorithm which has been developed at the University of Cape Town, the flotation distribution of the feed to the Red Dog cleaning circuit was calculated. This distribution coupled with the effect of the operating variables within each flotation. cell has been used to effectively model the Red Dog lend cleaning circuit...|$|E
40|$|An eleven-year-old {{spayed female}} Yorkshire Terrier {{presented}} with a sublumbar mass and upon ultrasonographic examination, was revealed to have a mammary gland tumor. Black to reddish colored masses, located in the visceral peritoneum of the sublumbar region was observed on laparotomy with masectomy of the right side. In the laparotomy, we observed reddish masses multifocally located in the serosal membrane of the large intestine. Histopathologic examination of the intestinal and abdominal mass showed highly invasiveness into the muscle and metastasis of melanocytic tumor cells through the blood vessels. The mammary glands showed abnormal hyperplasia of melanocytes, destruction of the normal glands by tumor cells and infiltration of some lymphocytes in the pool of melanocytic cells. We have identified a malignant melanoma containing an angiotumoral complex in which tumor cells occupied a pericytic location along the microvessels with intravasation determined by immunohistochemistry for S 100 protein and protein kinase C-α. Histologic findings in this <b>dog</b> <b>lead</b> to a diagnosis of an angiotropic metastatic malignant melanoma...|$|E

40|$|The {{design and}} {{optimisation}} of mineral flotation circuits is currently performed {{using a combination}} of laboratory, pilot plant and full scale testing. Owing to the variable nature of flotation circuits and the complex nature of the flotation process, it is difficult to interpret the data collected from flotation testwork. JKSimFloat is a computer modelling package which is being developed to interpret flotation testwork data collected at the various stages of the mining cycle. The parameters derived from the program can be used to assess potential circuit configurations in both the design of new flotation circuits and in the refinement of existing operations. The aim {{of this paper is to}} outline the modelling methodology used in JKSimFloat and to outline how it can be used effectively to model data collected from either the laboratory, the pilot plant or the existing flotation circuit. The use of flotation model parameters in circuit evaluation will be demonstrated via the use of a case study based on data collected from Cominco 2 ̆ 7 s Red <b>Dog</b> <b>lead</b> flotation circuit...|$|E
