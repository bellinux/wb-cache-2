5|$|A lead {{scientist}} for a pharmaceutical company is {{killed by a}} blue powder that turns his bones into dust. The Fringe division traces {{the source of the}} package which contained the powder to a former Marine; when they search his home, Peter (Joshua Jackson) finds the man nearby and gives chase, but the man is hit by a car and knocked into a coma. Broyles (Lance Reddick) fears that there may be others involved in targeted attacks. Walter (John Noble) suggests they read the man's mind to learn of any such plot using the ability of one of his undocumented nootropic Cortexiphan patients, Simon Phillips, (Omid Abtahi). Simon, who is unable to control his telepathic abilities, has isolated himself from the general population for two decades, but finds some comfort in not being able to read the mind of Olivia (Anna Torv)—a fellow Cortexiphan patient. Olivia convinces Simon to help them with the ongoing investigation despite the mental anguish he will suffer in a large crowded city such as Boston. During their time together, Olivia explains her concerns over Peter, wondering <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> feels any attraction to her alternate self, Fauxlivia, in the parallel universe. Meanwhile, three military contractors are killed by the release of the compound in an elevator, confirming Broyles' fears.|$|E

25|$|After {{taking some}} time off to re-evaluate, Darchinyan knocked out Pakpoom Hammarach in one round on 10 March 2017. The fight was taken by Darchinyan not for the money, but to see <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> had the hunger and desire to {{continue}} his boxing career. Taking place in Perth, this {{would be his last}} fight in Australia. He has confirmed his next fight will be his last and expressed interest in one more big fight against Evgeny Gradovich in Russia or Carl Frampton in England.|$|E
25|$|Execution {{seems to}} have been rare and carried out only as a last resort. If a murderer was unable/unwilling to pay éraic and was handed to his victim's family, they might kill him if they wished should nobody {{intervene}} by paying the éraic. Habitual or particularly serious offenders might be expelled from the kin-group and its territory. Such people became outlaws (with no protection from the law) and anyone who sheltered him became liable for his crimes. <b>If</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> haunted the territory and continued his crimes there, he was proclaimed in a public assembly and after this anyone might lawfully kill him.|$|E
25|$|Ashby was busted for {{possession}} of marijuana while scouting locations in Canada. This almost changed the studio's mind about backing the project, but the director's drug bust was not widely reported and Nicholson remained fiercely loyal to him, which was a deciding factor. Just as the film {{was about to go}} into production, Crosse was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Ashby postponed principal photography for a week to allow Crosse to deal with the news and decide <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> wanted to do the film. The actor decided not to do the film, and Ashby and Stalmaster scrambled to find a replacement. They cast Otis Young.|$|E

25|$|Although he {{went through}} a {{difficult}} five-year period (according to an interview with TV Guide {{before his death in}} 1984), Barry moved to Los Angeles, eventually finding work on local television. He would later admit in an article in TV Guide that, in order to determine <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> had a bad reputation (because of the requirement to have a license with the FCC), he raised money to buy a Redondo Beach radio station. Barry returned to hosting with The Generation Gap in 1969 and had success with The Joker's Wild, which premiered in 1972. Barry and Enright resumed their partnership full-time in 1976. Their production of game shows, notably the syndicated Tic-Tac-Dough (which Barry did not host) and Joker (which he did) in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in millions of dollars in revenue and, more importantly for both, forgiveness from the public for their involvement in the scandals.|$|E
25|$|In Malaysia's {{constitutional}} monarchy, Yang di-Pertuan Agong has extensive powers {{within the}} constitution. The constitution specifies that the executive {{power of the}} Federal government is vested in the Yang di-Pertuan Agong and is exercised by him {{on the advice of}} the Federal Council of Ministers. The latter is headed by the Prime Minister, appointed by the Yang di-Pertuan Agong from among the elected members of Parliament. Among them, Yang di-Pertuan Agong has discretionary powers to choose who he wants as the Prime Minister and is not bound by the decision of the outgoing PM if no party has won a majority vote (Article 40). It, however, does not afford him the right and authority to dismiss the PM. He also can dismiss or withhold consent to a request for the dissolution of Parliament (Article 40). He may discontinue or dissolve Parliament (Article 55) but he can only dissolve Parliament {{at the request of the}} PM (Article 43). He can reject any new laws or amendments to existing laws but <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> withholds permission, it will automatically become law after 30 days from the initial submission to him (Article 66).|$|E
25|$|During the Civil War II storyline, {{the vision}} of the Inhuman Ulysses showed a rampaging Hulk {{standing}} over the corpses of the superheroes. Meanwhile, Bruce Banner is shown to have set up a laboratory in Alpine, Utah, where he is approached by Captain Marvel, followed by Tony Stark, the rest of the Avengers, the X-Men, and the Inhumans. The confrontation leads to the Beast hacking into Banner's work servers and the revelation that he had been injecting himself with dead gamma-irradiated cells. S.H.I.E.L.D. Director Maria Hill places him under arrest. Banner gets infuriated at all these events, when suddenly, Hawkeye shoots Banner with an arrow to the head and then to the heart, killing him, much to the dismay and horror of the superheroes, especially Tony Stark. At an Avengers-presided tribunal, Hawkeye states that Bruce Banner had approached him and ordered him to kill him if he ever showed signs of turning into the Hulk again. At the funeral, Korg of the Warbound stated how Hulk wanted to be left alone and how his allies that he made along the way have become his family. In his video will, Bruce leaves various items to other heroes and his allies including leaving Doctor Strange his notes on the Hulk's ability to perceive ghosts and an egg-timer for the various former/current other Hulks (based on one of Bruce's more successful attempts to control himself as he would sit down for three minutes doing nothing before making a particularly big decision and then decide <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> wanted to do it).|$|E

500|$|When Reagan visited Moscow for {{the fourth}} summit in 1988, he {{was viewed as a}} celebrity by the Soviets. A {{journalist}} asked the president <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> considered the Soviet Union the evil empire. [...] "No," [...] he replied, [...] "I was talking about another time, another era." [...] At Gorbachev's request, Reagan gave a speech on free markets at the Moscow State University. In his autobiography, An American Life, Reagan expressed his optimism about the new direction that they charted and his warm feelings for Gorbachev. In November 1989, ten months after Reagan left office, the Berlin Wall was opened, the Cold War was unofficially declared over at the Malta Summit on December 3, 1989, and two years later, the Soviet Union collapsed.|$|E
500|$|... "I Found a Body" [...] {{features}} lyrics {{similar to}} the plot of Weekend at Bernie's, and incorporates Bruce's singing, concluding with a [...] "Pearl Jam style yell". [...] "Fonz Pond" [...] {{was inspired by a}} series of bicycle trails and paths leading to what had once been a pond, but had dried out, and was filled with garbage and rusted junk. Rumors spread about kids that died trying to pass the curve surrounding the area. Clark created a beat which sounded unlike what Bruce had initially expected, leading him to write a song about a haunted pond hidden in the woods. Bruce describes the production of [...] "Imma Kill U" [...] as similar to that of early albums by Ice Cube and Public Enemy. Bruce states that Utsler initially hated [...] "Juggalo Island" [...] when they began recording it, and said that it was [...] "too soft" [...] for Insane Clown Posse. Bruce maintained his confidence in the song, but promised Utsler that <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>still</b> felt the same way after the song was completed, it would be left off the album.
