Females can be up to 25% larger than males and weigh up to twice as much. Marked size <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> direction is unusual in higher vertebrates but typical in birds of prey, and most marked in birds of prey which hunt birds.|$|E
5|$|The {{calls of}} ruffed lemurs vary only {{slightly}} {{between the two}} species. In fact, in captivity, {{it has been documented}} that red ruffed lemurs understand and even join in the alarm calls of black-and-white ruffed lemurs. One minor difference between the vocal repertoires of these two species is in the pulse rate and frequency of the pulsed squawk, which is much faster and higher in red ruffed lemurs than in black-and-white ruffed lemurs. The <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> vocalization is only interspecific, showing no signs of significant sexual dimorphism within each species.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} known {{story to}} feature a beheading game is the 8th-century Middle Irish tale Bricriu's Feast. This story parallels Gawain in that, like the Green Knight, Cú Chulainn's antagonist feints three blows with the axe before letting his target depart without injury. A beheading exchange also {{appears in the}} late 12th-century Life of Caradoc, a Middle French narrative embedded in the anonymous First Continuation of Chrétien de Troyes' Perceval, the Story of the Grail. A notable <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> story is that Caradoc's challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. Lancelot is given a beheading challenge in the early 13th-century Perlesvaus, in which a knight begs him to chop off his head or else put his own in jeopardy. Lancelot reluctantly cuts it off, agreeing {{to come to the}} same place in a year to put his head in the same danger. When Lancelot arrives, the people of the town celebrate and announce that they have finally found a true knight, because many others had failed this test of chivalry.|$|E

500|$|The Game Boy Advance {{version is}} more of a hack and slash RPG, and is played from an {{isometric}} three-quarter top-down view.

This followed precedents in which the DOD bought space in other presidents' properties, but the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case was that the DOD's plan would directly profit President Trump's business holdings. Later that month, a controversial Indiegogo campaign launched to house refugees in Trump Tower in response to EO 13769, which barred nationals of several majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States before being superseded by EO 13780.|$|E

Executive {{producer}} Al Jean spoke to Entertainment Weekly in September 2014 about the third segment of the episode, and the difference in voices between the older and newer versions of the characters. He said that although Dan Castellaneta’s portrayal of Homer is better remembered for its evolution over time, Nancy Cartwright’s voicing of Bart changed as well, because [...] "it was lower-register, {{and you can see}} in the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> segment. It was really funny to get the interplay [...] and for the actors to see the voice evolution. The great thing is we didn’t have to ask—we already had the cast hired for the Tracey Ullman Simpsons."

2500|$|Although {{all five}} of the {{supervisors}} named in the questionnaire had testified at trial that they could continue working with Myers were she to return, the majority had given greater weight to what it held to be Connick's reasonable belief that {{the distribution of the}} questionnaire would adversely affect his authority. [...] "Such extreme deference to the employer's judgment is not appropriate" [...] for public employment, Brennan responded. He pointed to Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District, the landmark free-speech case in which the Court had upheld the right of high-school students to wear black armbands to school in protest against the Vietnam War. In that case a majority had held that the school officials' fear that the armbands would be disruptive, without any other evidence, did not justify prohibiting them.

2500|$|Most {{commentators}} {{agree that}} the timekeepers erred with respect to Rule 10.4.1; that is, the siren did not continue to sound until it was formally acknowledged by an umpire. [...] Acknowledgement of the siren requires {{any one of the}} three field umpires to raise both arms into the air and blow the whistle. [...] There remains some doubt as to whether any of the three umpires did hear the siren, but in any event, none chose to bring play to an end as required by Rule 10.4.2. [...] This rule is not well known by football fans and clearly states that the umpires are the sole judge of when a quarter ends. [...] However, generally this is in terms of a split second decision as to whether a mark or kick occurred before or after the siren sounded, rather than the 25 seconds <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> case.|$|E

2500|$|Rick Porcello pitched {{his third}} {{complete}} {{game of the}} season for his 21st win on just 89 pitches. He allowed two runs on four hits and struck out seven. Mookie Betts went deep for the eighth time this season in Camden Yards to give the Red Sox a third inning 2–0 lead. Dustin Pedroia plated Andrew Benintendi and David Ortiz homered for the 35th time to pad the lead to 5–1 in the fifth. In game two, Mookie Betts became the first major league player with 200 hits, 100 RBI and 100 runs scored since Miguel Cabrera won the triple crown in 2012. David Ortiz opened the one-run game wide open with a three-run shot in the seventh. Eduardo Rodríguez bounced back from his performance against the Yankees, and went 6 [...] innings, allowing two runs on 4 hits. The Orioles took a 1–0 lead in game three into the sixth, avoiding two bases loaded situations in the first and fourth inning. In the sixth, Jackie Bradley Jr. struck out with the bases loaded and one out. Sandy León hit a ground ball to Chris Davis at first, but he threw it past the pitcher Brad Brach and two runs scored. On the very next pitch Andrew Benintendi drove the ball out of Camden Yards for his second career-home run. Clay Buchholz just allowed the one run on three hits in seven innings and Boston won the season series against Baltimore {{for the first time since}} 2011. In the last game of the series, Buck Showalter pulled his ace Chris Tillman after 1 [...] innings. He allowed three runs, including a bases loaded walk to David Ortiz. The O's came back on a three-run shot off of David Price by rookie Trey Mancini in the third. Andrew Benintendi drove in Travis Shaw in the fifth, which was the <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> game. Hanley Ramírez continued his hot September, with his 29th home run of the season and his 10th in the month, to give the Red Sox some insurance. Price went seven innings and was backed up by Koji Uehara and Craig Kimbrel, who struck out a combined four batters. The Red Sox swept back-to-back four-game series for the first time since July 1 through 7 in 1968, against the Athletics and Twins. Boston went from 2 games back, to start the month, to a 5 [...] game lead over the Blue Jays in the AL East, with only nine games left on the season. They lowered the magic number to clinch the division from 17 to 5 over the past two series.|$|E
