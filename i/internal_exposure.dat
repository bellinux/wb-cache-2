Together with radium and transuranium elements, actinium {{is one of}} the most dangerous radioactive poisons with high specific α-activity. The most important feature of actinium is its ability to accumulate and remain in the surface layer of skeletons. At the initial stage of poisoning, actinium accumulates in the liver. Another danger of actinium is that it undergoes radioactive decay faster than being excreted. Adsorption from the digestive tract is much smaller (~0.05%) for actinium than radium.|$|E

40|$|Once the EC Directive 96 / 29 {{has been}} {{implemented}} into national regulation across Europe, {{the coordination of}} dosimetry laboratories for the monitoring of occupational exposures becomes the principal aim to achieve.

25|$|Caesium-137 {{is also a}} {{particular}} threat because it behaves like potassium and is taken up by cells throughout the body. Additionally, it has a long, 30-year half-life.

25|$|Radioactive {{material}} is found throughout nature. Detectable amounts occur naturally in soil, rocks, water, air, and vegetation, {{from which it}} is inhaled and ingested into the body. In addition to this <b>internal</b> <b>exposure,</b> humans also receive external exposure from radioactive materials that remain outside the body and from cosmic radiation from space. The worldwide average natural dose to humans is about 2.4 millisievert (mSv) per year. This is four times the worldwide average artificial radiation exposure, which in 2008 amounted to about 0.6mSv per year. In some rich countries, like the US and Japan, artificial exposure is, on average, greater than the natural exposure, due to greater access to medical imaging. In Europe, average natural background exposure by country ranges from under 2mSv annually in the United Kingdom to more than 7mSv annually for some groups of people in Finland.|$|E
25|$|On 30 October 2011 the Japanese {{government}} {{took up the}} plan to increase the 30 members of {{the staff at the}} Japanese embassy in Kiev, Ukraine to 36. For the first time two nuclear experts and three interpreters will be stationed here. In order to learn from the experience of this country with the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe. In this way Japan hoped to build on good relations between the two countries, also because growing numbers of Japanese officials were visiting Ukraine at that moment. The new staff was expected to gather information about handling a no-go zone, the removal of radioactive materials, and how to deal with <b>internal</b> <b>exposure</b> to radiation. People affected by the Chernobyl disaster would also be questioned. The embassy was equipped with dosimeters and protection outfits for field studies.

40|$|On 11 March 2011, a 9. 0 {{magnitude}} earthquake, {{which occurred}} at Northern Japan, and subsequent tsunami caused serious {{damage to the}} Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Station (FDNPS). People living within a radius of 30 km evacuated from their homes. Residents at Namie Town stayed at Tsushima district, which was located in the northwest of the FDNPS. As a highly concentrated radioactive plume passed through this area however, the evacuees werevery much worried about their radiation doses and <b>internal</b> <b>exposures.</b> In order to overcome this anxiety, public people should recognize more detailed knowledge about natural radiation exposure. There are several high back ground radiation areas (HBRAs) in the world. Residents living in these areas {{have been exposed to}} low dose radiation over a long term. Chapter 1 mainly describes the aim of the present study. The motivation and background as well. Chapter 2 describes the recognition of radiation among general public in Namie Town and Aomori Prefecture (Hirosaki, Aomori and Hachinohe Cities). The survey was carried out using anonymous questionnaires. According to the data analysis, people recognized that they were exposed to natural radiations of more than 1 mSv. However, people in Namie Town thought even radiation of 1 mSv would cause some biological effects. In addition, many people recognized that there would be differences in health effects between artificial and natural radiations, <b>internal</b> and external <b>exposures,</b> respectively. In particular, residents of Namie Town concerned about their own <b>internal</b> <b>exposures</b> by ingestion of food and water. Chapter 3 focuses on <b>internal</b> <b>exposures</b> caused by inhalation of radon and thoron progeny because the <b>internal</b> <b>exposures</b> have not yet been clarified in HBRAs. For their dose assessment, radon, thoron and thoron progeny concentrations were measured by passive monitors over a long period. Consequently, annual effective doses are estimated to be 3. 1 ± 2. 0 mSv for radon and 2. 2 ± 2. 5 mSv for thoron respectively. Total dose are estimated to be 5. 3 ± 3. 5 mSv a- 1. The present study has revealed that the radon dose was comparable than the thoron dose, and the total dose was about 2 times higher than the worldwide average. Chapter 4 summarized the present study. The conclusion is obtained as follows: In order to improve radiation risk communication, it is necessary to explain the health risk due to low dose chronic exposure clearly to general public using new scientific findings in HBRAs studies. For instance <b>internal</b> <b>exposures</b> due to inhalation of radon and thoron progeny are unavoidable for general public. It implies that the strategy may be effective for further understanding of radiation risk...|$|R

25|$|On 20 October 2011, the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan {{published}} its {{views on}} the evacuation zones around nuclear plants in case of accidents.

This draft plan included the designation of areas within 5 kilometers of plants as precautionary action zones, where residents would immediately evacuate {{in the event of an}} accident. Residents within a radius of about 50 kilometers would be prepared to take immediately action to prevent <b>internal</b> <b>exposure</b> to their thyroid glands by taking iodine tablets. Further studies were planned with experts and municipalities.

40|$|Mushrooms are {{recognized}} as one of the main contributors to <b>internal</b> radiation <b>exposure</b> from the activity concentration of radiocesium released by the accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant (CNNP). We evaluated the activity concentrations of the artificial radionuclides (radiocesium) in wild mushrooms collected in 2015 from Korosten and Lugine, Zhitomir region, Ukraine, located 120 km away from the CNPP. Cesium- 137 was detected in 110 of 127 mushroom samples (86. 6 %). Based on the average mushroom consumption (5 kg per year), we calculated committed effective doses ranging from 0. 001 – 0. 12 mSv. Cesium- 137 remains in the wild mushrooms even 30 years after the accident, but the committed effective doses are limited by the amount of contaminated mushrooms consumed.

40|$|Abstract: Dose {{assessment}} {{is a comprehensive}} analysis of the exposure received by individuals {{in the vicinity of}} facilities that release contaminants to the environment (i. e., real doses to real people). Performing dose assessment analyses which are extremely important elements for improving efficiency in radiological emergencies and accidents have been studied in this paper. For dose assessment purposes, the organ doses from internal and external sources are used to evaluate the risk of stochastic detriment and to determine limit values which have been exceeded. For contaminant releases, radiation doses estimates are needed for individual exposures in release procedures. Internal organ doses are not directly measured and there are different biokinetic models to estimate organ doses. These models are not always directly applicable to individuals who undergo exposures, mainly due to significant differences between healthy and pathological organ/metabolism (clinical conditions). There are two case studies in this paper for <b>internal</b> <b>exposures</b> and external exposures; In the first, we have estimated mean absorbed doses in <b>internal</b> <b>exposures</b> to organs by three different methods; using the conversion coefficients of ICRP publications 53, 62 or 80, for radio-nuclides, Through Monte Carlo simulation, using the Visual Monte Carlo (VMC), Biokinetic models simulation using Dose and risk CALculation 60 (DCAL).
