Let us seek favour with none. Always <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>news</b> sheet we will seek to speak dutifully and with all reverence of the King his Majesty: let us also speak with all respect and commendation of His Majesty's great prelates and nobles, for are they not the exalted of the land? Also I would have it that we say nothing harsh against our wealthy merchants and burgesses, for hath not the Lord prospered them in their substances. Yea, friends, let us speak ever well of the King, the clergy, the nobility and of all persons of wealth and substantial holdings. But beyond this"--here Brenton Coxton's eye flashed,--"let us speak with utter fearlessness of all men. So shall we be, if I may borrow a mighty good word from Tacitus his Annals, of a complete independence, hanging on to no man. In fact our venture shall be an independent newspaper." ...|$|E

It protects target server and networks by delaying 32. 4 % incoming requests. This relieves congestion in networks by reducing response packet drop rate from 25 % to 2 %.

Further, we find that NEWS shows similar performance as the best possible rate limiter. ...|$|R

40|$|Residents’ {{groups have}} been in {{existence}} in New Zealand for almost 150 years yet very {{little is known about}} them. The collection of residents’, ratepayers’ and progressive associations, community councils, neighbourhood committees and the like make up a part of the community governance sector that numbers over a thousand-strong. These groups are featured prominently <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>news</b> media, are active in local government affairs and expend many thousands of volunteer hours every year in their work in communities… but what exactly is that work? From the literature we see these groups can be a source of local community knowledge (Kass et al., 2009), a platform for political activity (Deegan, 2002), critical of government (Fullerton, 2005) or help maintain government transparency and accountability (Mcclymont and O'Hare, 2008). They are sometimes part of the establishment too (Wai, 2008) and are often heard promoting the interests of local people (Slater, 2004). Residents’ groups can be set up to represent the interests of a specific demographic group (Seng, 2007) or focus on protecting or promoting a sense of place (Kushner and Siegel, 2003) or physical environment (Savova, 2009). Some groups undertake charitable activities (Turkstra, 2008) or even act in a negative manner that can impact on the community (Horton, 1996). This research examines 582 New Zealand organisations to derive a set of purposes that residents’ groups perform and ascertains how their purposes differ between geo-social and political locality and over three distinct eras of community development. The thesis also examines the relationship between residents’ groups and councillors, council officers, district health board members and civil defence and seeks to uncover if the level of engagement (if any) has an affect on their overall raison d’etre. The research concludes with a typology of New Zealand residents’ groups along with the key purposes of each type...|$|E
40|$|Today {{most people}} are in {{agreement}} that the media industry is in crisis. Many newsrooms cut down on staff. At {{the same time the}} PR industry is growing. We wanted to research if this could affect the unbiased and independent news <b>in</b> <b>our</b> <b>news</b> media today. Today's newsrooms receive a lot of press releases every day. How many of these reach the published news? Our main purpose was to study the origin of the news published in four different media. To study how many of the news that came from press releases and learn the opinion about press releases of each news editor, and if they treat different senders in different ways. We examined four different media: one daily newspaper, one tabloid, one local radio sta-tion and one regional television newscast. This we did by examine two days of their news. To find out the source in a reliable way we called the people appearing in the article and not just the reporter. We also interviewed the news editor of each media. Our results show that our theory on cutting down staff would affect the use of press releas-es did not correlate with the reality. According to our study the news editors and news-rooms are mostly positive towards press releases. They use them as any other tip or source. However they all agree that, since they get so many, {{it takes a lot of}} their time to sort them all out. Although all editors also agree that they don't rely on getting news from press re-leases, the result shows otherwise. Press releases seem to be a daily part of the newsrooms, at least the two days we examined. Our result also shows that there is a difference in usage of press releases between the different media organizations, and the press releases that are mostly used come from authorities and not from profit-driven companies. Our study excludes sports and culture, because we wanted to focus on the most unbiased part of the news. If these had not been excluded the result would probably have been very different...|$|E

40|$|During {{the first}} half of 2001 a group of {{researchers}} at Murdoch University joined with Norm Taylor, former head of News and Current Affairs at the ABC, to create a methodology for analysing the shape and substance of television news. A content analysis database was devised and during a one month trial in Perth in June 2001 the television news bulletins of the five networks were collected and analysed in terms of story content; story duration; story placement in the bulletin; and bulletin structure. It was hoped that this trial would pave the way for a broader longitudinal national study comparing news services around the country. Inadvertently the researchers captured what now appears to be a bygone era, a pre- 9 / 11 benchmark before the War on Terror domination over the national and international news agenda. The Living in Harmony project has provided an opportunity to apply the methodology to an analysis of the amount and nature of reporting on multicultural affairs in Australia’s television news services. The original study forms a useful baseline against which to assess multiculturalism in television news. Not only can we assess the types of stories and the way they are reported; we can also pose questions such as: How much multicultural content is there in news now compared to then? Have there been changes in the sorts of multicultural stories selected {{and the way in which}} they are told? In the post 9 / 11 world what if anything is happening to the public face of multiculturalism as reflected <b>in</b> <b>our</b> television <b>news?...</b>|$|R

40|$|As a {{consequence}} of the advent and diffusion of new media, one of the most accredited hypotheses in the realm of mediatization theory has been that the essential prerequisites of mediatization would have slowly started to disappear. On the contrary, we hypothesize that the unprecedented knowledge about users’ preferences given to media companies would be reflected in the logics of news production, which would shift from being guided by internal logics and standards of newsworthiness to be driven by an audience-oriented commercial logic. Therefore, we expect storytelling techniques to prevail in online news production, with soft news becoming progressively prevalent moving from traditional to new media. We address our hypothesis performing a cross-media analysis of the Italian newspaper la Repubblica, investigating both the different editorial logics underlying the selection and framing of contents as well as the relationship between the general news frame and the level of readers’ engagement. <b>In</b> <b>our</b> findings, soft <b>news</b> prevails regardless of the platform, also following a positive trend as we move towards Facebook.

We compare this feature with traditional accent prediction features (based on part of speech and N-grams) as well as with several linguistically motivated and manually labeled information structure features, such as whether a word is given, new, or contrastive. Our results show that the linguistic features do not lead to significant improvements, while accent ratio alone can yield prediction performance almost as good as the combination of any other subset of features. Moreover, this feature is useful even across genres; an accent-ratio classifier trained only on conversational speech predicts prominence with high accuracy <b>in</b> broadcast <b>news.</b> <b>Our</b> results suggest that carefully chosen lexicalized features can outperform less fine-grained features...|$|R
