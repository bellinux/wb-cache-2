[...] Harmer said of the bass line, [...] "I immediately gravitated to the creepy, stalker-ish theme that Ben created with the lyrics and the piano chords.... I liked the idea that once a stalker gets obsessed with an idea, it <b>just</b> <b>keeps</b> repeating in his head, so I wanted the bass line to have a repetitive, incessant theme." ...|$|E

500|$|Allmusic's Eduardo Rivadavia, {{said that}} release of Inflikted [...] "brings to {{fruition}} {{one of the}} most anticipated yet most improbable reunions in heavy metal history." [...] Rivadavia expressed that Duplantier [...] "generally <b>just</b> <b>keeps</b> a low sonic profile and his nose out of trouble, but Rizzo's contributions really can't be overstated. [...] His otherworldly soloing and inventive melodic lines often serve as the creative catalysts responsible for the most inspired moments." [...] Keith Carman of Exclaim! praised the group's musicianship on Inflikted, saying that [...] "it wouldn't be a stretch to proclaim that Inflikted, with its detuned grunt, bombastic lyrics and hyperactive drumming, is the album that should have succeeded Sepultura's widely-acclaimed 1996 powerhouse Roots." [...] Like the former, Adrien Begrand of PopMatters wrote enthusiastically for both Cavalera Conspiracy and Inflikted.|$|E
500|$|In December 2010, the New York Times wrote Fringe [...] "has {{kept its}} plates {{spinning}} entertainingly well into its third season" [...] {{and called it}} [...] "the best major-network show {{that no one is}} watching".

[...] For 2011, Fringe third season helped the show place sixth on Digital Spy's top 25 television shows of the year, which described the season as [...] "exemplary". Similarly, The A.V. Club named Fringe the sixteenth best television series of 2011, in particular highlighting [...] "Lysergic Acid Diethylamide" [...] and [...] "The Firefly".|$|E
500|$|... "Return to Sender" [...] was {{generally}} praised by critics. Eric Goldman of IGN {{wrote that the}} episode's [...] "most interesting facet" [...] was its flashbacks to Dexter's youth from Debra's perspective, though {{he felt that the}} young Debra's hasty apology to Dexter after insulting him was [...] "a slightly cheesy moment". He thought that LaGuerta's bonding with Oscar [...] "was okay, but [...] fell a little flat". TV Guides Paula Paige [...] "love" [...] the episode, saying that [...] "It <b>just</b> <b>keeps</b> getting better and better", but was unsure [...] "what Deb having dinner with the Doakes' family has to do with anything". Writing for TV Squad, Jonathan Toomey opened his review of [...] "Return to Sender" [...] by saying, [...] "Dexter did it again. Wowed me. Amazed me. Edge of my seat for the whole hour." [...] He was amused that Debra's profile of Valerie's murderer matched Dexter, but was uninterested in Rita's storyline with her husband.|$|E

500|$|After a month out of work, Westley rejoined Stevenage on 30 March 2013, {{his third}} spell in charge at the club. On the appointment, Stevenage {{chairman}} Phil Wallace stated [...] "Graham was keen {{to come back}} to Stevenage and, although I met some strong candidates, without doubt I think he’s the best man for the job right now. The club enjoyed a great deal of success before he left last year and we moved forwards significantly in his time here on several levels". On his return, Westley said [...] "I'm really happy to be back, the training ground is fantastic, the club <b>just</b> <b>keeps</b> moving forward. All the facilities keep improving and I hope that I can come back and make another positive difference". In his first game back in charge of the club, Stevenage secured a 1–0 victory over Hartlepool United on 1 April.

500|$|As {{literary}} scholar Diane Long Hoeveler has demonstrated, Mary is {{not only}} a sentimental novel, but, with its emphasis on death, hyperbolic emotion, and persecution, also a gothic novel. Hoeveler identifies in the text what she calls [...] "Gothic feminism", an ideology that values the persecuted heroine above all: it [...] "is not about being equal to men" [...] but rather [...] "about being morally superior to men. It is about being a victim". In other words, Hoeveler argues that the position of victim grants women moral authority. In a Freudian reading, she focuses on how Mary [...] "displaces and projects her own anger and disappointment" [...] onto other characters, such as Ann and Henry. In this interpretation, Ann and Henry become surrogate parents to Mary; she is [...] "unable to move out of her childish identifications with parental figures, and so she <b>just</b> <b>keeps</b> constructing one parent-substitute after another, never being able to accept the demands and realities required for marriage".|$|E

The audio mixing of [...] "Superpower" [...] was completed by Tony Maserati at Mirrorbal Studios and Clockworks Studios and the track was eventually mastered by Tom Coyne and Aya Merrill at Sterling Sound. Beyoncé explained on her iTunes Radio channel that she considered [...] "Superpower" [...] to be a [...] "powerful" [...] song with strong vocals; she went on saying, [...] "he lyrics that Frank Ocean wrote... it's like he thought of one thing and the thought <b>just</b> <b>keeps</b> going and going... Basically the message is love {{is the most powerful}} thing we have and it doesn't matter if a war, if a riot is going on. When you are with the person you love, you can survive any and everything." ...|$|E

500|$|American Pharoah {{began his}} 2015 {{campaign}} with wins in the Rebel Stakes and Arkansas Derby {{and went on}} to win the 2015 Kentucky Derby and 2015 Preakness Stakes. He won the Triple Crown in a wire-to-wire victory at the 2015 Belmont Stakes, becoming the first American Triple Crown winner since Affirmed in 1978 and the 12th in history. His winning time was the second-fastest for a Triple Crown winner, and his closing quarter-mile time of 24.32 was faster than Secretariat's. [...] He next shipped to Monmouth Park and easily won the Haskell Invitational on August 2, prompting Baffert to say, [...] "He <b>just</b> <b>keeps</b> bringing it; he's a great horse." [...] Three weeks later, he finished a close second in a hard-fought Travers Stakes at Saratoga Race Course on August 29, 2015, snapping a winning streak of eight races.

500|$|On September 9, Feldman threw {{seven innings}} of shutout ball against the Cleveland Indians, leading Texas to a 10–0 win. [...] He struck out five, while giving up five singles, raising his record to 16–4, and tying Sabathia and Verlander for the AL lead in victories. [...] He {{became the first}} Rangers pitcher to win 16 games since Kevin Millwood in 2006. [...] It was his seventh win in a row, eighth {{straight}} road victory (a new Texas record), and 12th road win overall in 2009 (another new club record, and tops in the AL). [...] "I'm not doing anything different on the road than I am at home", said Feldman, who had allowed only one run in the last 26.1 innings. [...] "The preparation is the same. [...] I think it's a pretty humbling game, so you can't get too high or too low." [...] He became the first Rangers right-hander to allow just one run over four consecutive starts. [...] Outfielder Marlon Byrd said: [...] "When you have your ace on the mound, you expect to win. You {{get a couple of}} runs early, and you feel you have a 'W' in hand. [...] He has been unbelievable this year when he steps on the mound.... He <b>just</b> <b>keeps</b> getting better." ...|$|E
500|$|Dan Casey at Nerdist {{found the}} adage [...] "third {{time is the}} charm" [...] {{to apply to the}} episode, feeling that [...] "Rather than {{trying to figure out where}} it fits within Marvel’s grander {{on-screen}} universe, S.H.I.E.L.D. is focusing its energy on developing the eponymous agents and giving us more backstory", and though he felt that [...] "The show still needs to figure out its balance of seriousness and humor", he concluded that the [...] "show <b>just</b> <b>keeps</b> getting better." [...] James Hunt at Den of Geek felt that [...] "There's a distinct feeling of treading water", finding the episodic plot to be [...] "fairly by-the-numbers for a show that's supposed to be about the fantastic", and he was disappointed in [...] "Graviton's non-appearance appearance", referring to the lack of Hall's comics' alter-ego. Marc Bernardin of The Hollywood Reporter praised the episode's opening sequence, but criticized the character Skye and the focus the episode put on her rather than Coulson. He also spoke unfavorably of Quinn, noting that Hall would likely return as a villain himself in the future, but [...] "until then, S.H.I.E.L.D. needs to up its adversarial game". Jim Steranko, known for his work on Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D., felt [...] "the plot’s twists and turns clicked, even though it’s kind of embarrassing when the commercials are more engrossing than the show." ...|$|E

Christine Orlando from TV Fanatic also praised the episode, calling it [...] "one of its most entertaining episode's yet".

500|$|Speculation ignited that Ponting was an {{outsider}} {{to be selected}} for the Australian squad on their 1993 tour to England. Of the speculation, Ponting said [...] "At {{the start of the}} season I was wondering whether or not I'd play Shield cricket this year and all of a sudden there's talk in the papers that I'm a chance go on an Australian tour of England. I think it's way out of reach — there are blokes like [...] Jamie Siddons who have scored 20 or 30 first-class centuries who are ahead of me. Nevertheless, Shipperd thought Ponting could handle the experience: [...] "A lot of attention affects different people in different ways, but Ricky is such a well-rounded young fella that it hasn't changed him. I've told him to enjoy the all the attention and if he <b>just</b> <b>keeps</b> on being himself I'm sure he'll cope well with all the success that I imagine he will achieve." [...] The selectors eventually chose Western Australian batsman Damien Martyn for the tour, with Ponting selected in the Academy squad captained by Justin Langer, which toured India and Sri Lanka for seven games in August and September in 1993. Australian success was limited, with only a few wins. No batsman scored a century, but Ponting reached 99 not out in a one-day game in Colombo. He finished the tour second highest in the run-scorers behind Langer.|$|E
500|$|American Pharoah's next {{race was}} the Haskell Invitational, held August 2 at Monmouth Park, New Jersey. Zayat wanted the horse's first race back be an [...] "easy" [...] race against other 3-year-olds, {{he wanted to}} race the horse in Zayat's home state of New Jersey, {{and he wanted to}} race on a Sunday to avoid a clash with the Jewish Sabbath. Zayat explained, [...] "He can run anywhere... as long as he's happy and healthy... I told ... 'I want to do it for the sport and not worry about the money and stuff." [...] Nonetheless, Monmouth Park raised the purse money for the race from $1 million to $1.75 million. Zayat had {{previously}} won the Haskell with Paynter in 2012, and Baffert already held the record for the most Haskell wins, having seven previous victories. Over 60,000 people showed up at Monmouth Park, which featured the Bruce Springsteen song [...] "Born to Run" [...] in the post parade. Viewed as being in even better physical condition than in the Belmont, American Pharoah took the lead in the far turn and easily opened up a five-length lead over the six other horses in the race before Espinoza eased him back as second-place finisher Keen Ice made a strong finishing push. He won the race by [...] lengths with a time of 1:47.95 for the 9-furlong distance. Espinoza quipped, [...] "He was having fun, and so was I."
