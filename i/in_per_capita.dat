5|$|A major {{producer}} of natural gas, oil, and agricultural products, Oklahoma relies on an economic base of aviation, energy, telecommunications, and biotechnology. In 2007, it {{had one of}} the fastest-growing economies in the United States, ranking among the top states <b>in</b> <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> income growth and gross domestic product growth. Both Oklahoma City and Tulsa serve as Oklahoma's primary economic anchors, with nearly two-thirds of Oklahomans living within their metropolitan statistical areas.|$|E

Cleveland also has {{emerging}} biotechnology and financial concentrations. It is also worthwhile to note that while some cities in Ohio have declining populations, the overall growth <b>in</b> <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> income in Ohio increased by 4.6% from 2005 to 2006.|$|E

Movable print, improved seeds for rice and other commercial crops, gunpowder, water-powered mechanical clocks, the use of coal {{as a source of}} fuel for a variety of industries, improved techniques for iron and steel production, pound locks and many other technological innovations transformed the economy. In north China, the main fuel source for ceramic kilns and iron furnaces shifted from wood to coal.|$|E

40|$|Convergence <b>in</b> {{cross country}} <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> carbon {{emission}} rates {{is an important}} concept in the climate change debate. This paper provides an empirical analysis of emissions <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> convergence. This analysis {{is crucial to the}} assessment of projection models that generate convergence <b>in</b> emission <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> rates and to the assessment of policy proposals that advocate imposing convergence <b>in</b> emissions <b>per</b> <b>capita.</b> The main conclusions in this paper are based on a detailed examination of the intra-distributional dynamics of cross country emissions <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> over time. Stochastic kernel estimation of these dynamics suggests that the cross country distribution of emissions <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> is characterised by persistence. There is little evidence that emission <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> rates across countries are converging in an absolute sense. Projection models that generate convergence <b>in</b> emissions <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> are therefore inconsistent with empirical behaviour. Policies that impose convergence <b>in</b> emissions <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> are likely to generate large re-distributional impacts...|$|R

The collections of Thomas Gilcrease are housed in the Gilcrease Museum of Tulsa, which also holds the world's largest, most comprehensive collection of art and artifacts of the American West.|$|E
5|$|Minnesota has a {{progressive}} income tax structure; the four brackets of {{state income tax}} rates are 5.35, 7.05, 7.85 and 9.85 percent. As of 2008, Minnesota was ranked 12th in the nation <b>in</b> <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> total state and local taxes. In 2008, Minnesotans paid 10.2 {{percent of their income}} in state and local taxes; the U.S. average was 9.7 percent. The state sales tax in Minnesota is 6.875 percent, but there is no sales tax on clothing, prescription drug medications, some services, or food items for home consumption. The state legislature may allow municipalities to institute local sales taxes and special local taxes, such as the 0.5 percent supplemental sales tax in Minneapolis. Excise taxes are levied on alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel. The state imposes a use tax on items purchased elsewhere but used within Minnesota. Owners of real property in Minnesota pay property tax to their county, municipality, school district, and special taxing districts.|$|E

30|$|The {{solution}} {{to address the}} problem with the panel effects was to examine the changes in various variables across years instead of their values in different years. Scatterplots for the average annual difference <b>in</b> real <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> GHE and various independent variables were drawn. In all figures, Qinghai is clearly an outlier due to its large increase <b>in</b> real <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> GHE. Tibet is also an obvious outlier, with its large increase <b>in</b> real <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> budgetary deficits. It appears that Qinghai and Tibet may not fit into the same model with the other provinces. Therefore, regressions were run both with and without these two provinces for sensitivity test.|$|R

This paper empirically tests {{the validity of the}} EKC hypothesis <b>in</b> Canada for <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> emissions of green house gases (GHG), CO 2, NOX, SOX, CO, and total particulate matter (TPM) emissions.

The type of data used are provincial and territorial level cross-sectional panel data and country level time-series data. The study finds that <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> emissions of GHG and CO exhibit inverted-U relationships with <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> GDP. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> SOX and TPM emissions follow a U-shape curve, <b>In</b> addition, <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> CO 2 emissions may follow either an inverted U or an N shape curve.

40|$|Recent {{papers have}} debated the {{existence}} of convergence <b>in</b> carbon dioxide <b>per</b> <b>capita.</b> This paper improves on existing work and examines {{the importance of education}} on the convergence <b>in</b> carbon dioxide <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> emissions over the period 1970 - 2004 for 85 countries. We use panel data and apply GMM-System. This rigorous approach takes into account observed and unobserved heterogeneity of countries and solves the endogeneity of some variables. Our results suggest a divergence <b>in</b> carbon dioxide <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> emissions and education doesn’t matter. Contrary to common intuition, in developing countries there is no convergence and education doesn’t matter for carbon dioxide growth. In developed countries, education favours convergence <b>in</b> carbon dioxide <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> only if it interacts with good political institutions. Without interaction to political institutions, education increases carbon dioxide <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> growth and handicaps carbon dioxide <b>per</b> <b>capita</b> convergence...|$|R
