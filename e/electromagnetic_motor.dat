40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} the linear <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>motor</b> (LEM) {{which consists of}} two solenoids and a slide control with neodymium magnet bars placed on its end. The work of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>motor</b> {{is based on the}} phenomenon of electromagnetic repulsion. The device also includes an electromagnetic brake which allows to stop the slider or to hold the slider in a fixed position, without electricity supply. The range of the slider movement is up to 50 mm. The paper deals with the problem of implementation of the Genetic Algorithm GA to calculate Pareto-optimal solutions. In this process, the functions of voltage powering solenoids used to control the position of the linear <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>motor</b> are evaluated. This procedure assumes minimizing two conflicted criteria: the time of movement of the motor and the energy input. In this case the device works in the open-loop system without a feedback loop.

40|$|Micromanipulation {{requires}} {{very high}} resolution robotic systems {{in order to}} achieve repeatabilities and precisions that are compatible with the dimension of the objects being manipulated. This makes it preferable to use compliant structures rather than articuflated mechanisms, at least close to end-effectors. Otherwise, articulated mechanisms can introduce dry friction that usually lead to deterioration of resolution. In addition, the actuators used to motorize microrobots must respect these constraints. This is why it is often necessary to use actuators that are different from those commonly used on the microscopie scale, such as <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>motors.</b> This is particularly true for the final stage driving the end-effectors...|$|R
40|$|Actuators {{determine}} {{the performance of}} robotic systems at the most intimate of levels. As a result, much {{work has been done}} to assess the performance of different actuator systems. However, biomimetics has not previously been utilized as a pretext for tuning a series elastic actuator system with the purpose of designing an empirical testing platform. Thus, an artificial muscle tendon system has been developed in order to assess the performance of two distinct actuator types: (1) direct current <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>motors</b> and (2) ultrasonic rotary piezoelectric motors. Because the design of the system takes advantage of biomimetic operating principles such as co-contraction in an agonist-antagonist configuration, it exists as an ideal system for testing different actuators for implicit performance attributes {{that may or may not}} come closer to the physiological performance of biological muscle. In order to assess the respective performances of the two actuator types, error and system efficiency were both measured simultaneously in an attempt to characterize the fidelity and efficacy of the force-feedback control system. Although both motor types were shown to perform competitively by torque error, the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>motors</b> outperformed in terms of efficiency. It is ultimately concluded that either actuator type may perform more impressively than the other when operating under the appropriate context of application. Specifically, it remains the interpretation of this study that piezoelectric motors require a stiffer elasticity as well as an extremely fast controller frequency in order to fully take advantage of its ultra-fast response time characteristic for torque control...|$|R

The current flowing in the winding is producing the fields and for a motor using a magnetic material the field is not linearly proportional to the current.
