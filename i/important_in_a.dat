5|$|Miking a Leslie is also <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{recording}} studio, as {{the choice}} and positioning of microphones determines the overall recorded sound. A popular recommendation is two Shure SM57s {{on the horn}} and a Sennheiser MD421 on the drum. Recording Magazine's Dave Martin suggests a similar setup, with various microphone models used as stereo pairs on the horn but using an Electro-Voice RE20 on the drum instead. Keith Emerson recorded his Leslie using a single mic each on the horn and the drum, but with the covers removed.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{research}} {{demonstrates that}} two important skills in joint attention are following eye gaze and identifying intention. The ability to share gaze with another individual {{is an important}} skill in establishing reference. The ability to identify intention is <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> child's ability to learn language and direct the attention of others. Joint attention is important for many aspects of language development including comprehension, production and word learning. Episodes of joint attention provide children with information about their environment, allowing individuals to establish reference from spoken language and learn words. Socio-emotional development {{and the ability to}} take part in normal relationships are also influenced by joint attention abilities. The ability to establish joint attention may be negatively affected by deafness, blindness, and developmental disorders such as autism.|$|E

30|$|The {{prevalence}} of asthma has increased over recent decades {{and the reasons}} for this are poorly understood. A sensitive tool that can evaluate potential risk factors for asthma is bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR), a key physiological characteristic of asthma. However, although the minimum clinically <b>important</b> difference <b>in</b> BHR for <b>an</b> individual is accepted to be around one doubling dose, the minimum <b>important</b> change <b>in</b> <b>a</b> population is not defined.

According to Peter Cushing, speaking on Late Night Line-Up in 1965, these scenes were filmed on the demolition site that became BBC Television Centre. Following the filming, rehearsals for the cast began at Mary Ward Settlement, Tavistock Place from 22 November (moving to 60 Paddington Street from 29 November). During these rehearsals, the cast memorised their lines and cues as <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> live television production as in a stage play.|$|E
25|$|Lawrence turned 40 in March 1951 {{and over}} the {{remaining}} five years of his first-class career there was a subtle change {{in his role as}} a Somerset cricketer. Reliable throughout for 70 or more wickets a season, he never passed 100 again, though he got close with 93 in 1954. But his batting continued to develop and was increasingly <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> side whose frailties in every department consigned it {{to the foot of the}} County Championship for four consecutive seasons from 1952 to 1955.

They {{are involved in}} maintaining {{the structure of the}} cell and, together with microfilaments and intermediate filaments, they form the cytoskeleton. They also make up the internal structure of cilia and flagella.They provide platforms for intracellular transport and are involved in a variety of cellular processes, including the movement of secretory vesicles, organelles, and intracellular macromolecular assemblies (see entries for dynein and kinesin). They are also involved in chromosome separation (mitosis and meiosis), and are the major constituents of mitotic spindles, which are used to pull apart eukaryotic chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|The {{routine is}} marked out of 10 by five judges with {{deductions}} for incomplete moves or poor form. Usually {{the highest and}} lowest scores are discarded. Additional points can be added depending on {{the difficulty of the}} skills being performed. The degree of difficulty (DD or tariff) is calculated by adding a factor for each half turn (or twist) or quarter somersault. Difficulty is <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> routine, however, there are differences in opinion between various coaches whether it is better to focus on increasing the difficulty of routines given that this usually results in a reduced form score or to focus on improving execution scores by displaying better form in an easier routine.|$|E
25|$|When {{the writing}} team worked on an episode, each writer took a {{character}} {{and wrote the}} individual scenes surrounding them. These stories were then combined and given to the episode writer. This system allowed every writer to contribute to every episode, and enabled the writing team to finish scripts sooner, so the filming crew could shoot more scenes at a location. Kring described the writing process as a collaborative one and stated that the collaboration process was important because production needed to shoot several scenes at a single location. To do this, several scripts had to be ready. Jesse Alexander, co-producer and writer, explained that this process was <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> serialized drama because one has to know where each character's development is heading.|$|E

25|$|Aerodynamics is <b>important</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{number of}} {{applications}} other than aerospace engineering. It is {{a significant factor in}} any type of vehicle design, including automobiles. It is important in the prediction of forces and moments acting on sailing vessels. It is used in the design of mechanical components such as hard drive heads. Structural engineers also use aerodynamics, and particularly aeroelasticity, to calculate wind loads in the design of large buildings and bridges. Urban aerodynamics seeks to help town planners and designers improve comfort in outdoor spaces, create urban microclimates and reduce the effects of urban pollution. The field of environmental aerodynamics describes the ways atmospheric circulation and flight mechanics affect ecosystems. The aerodynamics of internal passages is important in heating/ventilation, gas piping, and in automotive engines where detailed flow patterns strongly affect the performance of the engine.|$|E
25|$|Munden did {{not sustain}} this batting form, however, and his highest score after 1952 was just 64, {{although}} he still on occasion contributed useful {{runs from the}} lower order. Instead, his bowling became more <b>important.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> match in 1953 on the pitch at Bath where Bertie Buse's benefit match had ended {{in a single day}} just a week earlier he achieved both the best innings and match figures of his career, taking six for 33 in the second Somerset innings to follow four wickets for nine runs in the first innings: the figures of 10 for 42 were the only time he took 10 wickets in a match. By 1955, when he took 87 wickets in the season, he had supplanted the ageing Walsh as Leicestershire's main left-arm spin bowler. In this season, he was picked for end-of-season representative matches in the Scarborough cricket festival, including an appearance in the Players team where he was successful as a batsman.|$|E
