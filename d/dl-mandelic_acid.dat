40|$|A {{microorganism}} {{capable of}} degrading <b>DL-mandelic</b> <b>acid</b> was isolated from sewage sediment of enrichment culture and {{was identified as}} Pseudomonas convexa. It was found to metabolize mandelic acid by a new pathway involving 4 -hydroxymandelic acid, 4 -hydroxybenzaldehyde, 4 -hydroxybenzoic acid, and 3, 4 -dihydroxybenzoic acid as aromatic intermediates. All the enzymes of the pathway were demonstrated in cell-free extracts. L-Mandelate- 4 -hydroxylase, a soluble enzyme, requires tetrahydropteridine, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate, reduced form, and Fe 2 + for its activity. The next enzyme, L- 4 -hydroxymandelate oxidase (decarboxylating), a particulate enzyme, requires flavine adenine dinucleotide and Mn 2 + for its activity. A nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-dependent, {{as well as a}} nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate-dependent, benzaldehyde dehydrogenase has been resolved and partially purified...|$|E
40|$|An L-amino amidase from Mycobacterium neoaurum ATCC 25795 {{responsible}} for the enantioselective resoln. of DL-a-Me valine amide was purified and characterized. The purifn. procedure included ammonium sulfate fractionation, gel filtration, and anion-exchange chromatog., {{which resulted in a}} homogeneous prepn. of the enzyme with a native mol. mass of 136 kDa and a subunit mol. mass of 40 kDa. The purified enzyme displayed the highest activity at 50 DegC and a pH 8. 0 and 9. 5. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by the metal-chelating agent 1, 10 -phenanthroline, the disulfide-reducing agent dithiothreitol, and the cysteine proteinase inhibitor iodoacetamide. The purified amino amidase showed a unique L-enantioselective activity towards a broad range of both a-H- and a-alkyl-substituted amino acid amides, with the highest activity towards the cyclo amino acid amide DL-proline amide. No activity was measured with <b>DL-mandelic</b> <b>acid</b> amide nor with the dipeptide L-phenylalanine-L-leucine. The highest catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km ratio) was measured with DL-a-allyl alanine amide, DL-a-Me phenylalanine amide, and DL-a-Me leucine amide. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|E
40|$|Magnetite {{nanoparticles}} are {{of great}} importance in nanotechnology and nanomedicine and have found manifold applications. Here, the effect of coating of magnetite nanoparticles with organic stabilizers, such as O-phosphoryl ethanolamine, glycerol phosphate, phospho-l-ascorbic acid, phospho-d,l-serine, glycolic acid, lactic acid, d,l-malic acid, and <b>d,l-mandelic</b> <b>acid</b> was studied. Remarkably, this procedure led to an improvement of saturation magnetization in three cases rather than to an unfavorable decrease as usually observed. Detailed X-ray powder diffraction investigations revealed that changes in the average crystallite occurred in the coating process. Surprisingly, changes of the average crystallite sizes in either direction were further observed, when the exposure time to the stabilizer was increased. These results imply a new mechanism for the well-known coating of magnetite nanoparticles with stabilizers. Instead of the hitherto accepted simple anchoring of the stabilizers to the magnetite nanoparticle surfaces, a more complex recrystallization mechanism is likely, wherein partial re-dispersion of magnetite moieties from the nanoparticles and re-deposition are involved. The results can help producers and users of magnetite nanoparticles to obtain optimal results {{in the production of}} core shell magnetite nanoparticles...|$|E
40|$|This work compares {{classification}} {{results of}} lactose, mandelic acid and <b>dl-mandelic</b> <b>acid,</b> obtained {{on the basis}} of their respective THz transients. The performance of three different pre-processing algorithms applied to the time-domain signatures obtained using a THz-transient spectrometer are contrasted by evaluating the classifier performance. A range of amplitudes of zero-mean white Gaussian noise are used to artificially degrade the signal-to-noise ratio of the time-domain signatures to generate the data sets that are presented to the classifier for both learning and validation purposes. This gradual degradation of interferograms by increasing the noise level is equivalent to performing measurements assuming a reduced integration time. Three signal processing algorithms were adopted for the evaluation of the complex insertion loss function of the samples under study; a) standard evaluation by ratioing the sample with the background spectra, b) a subspace identification algorithm and c) a novel wavelet-packet identification procedure. Within class and between class dispersion metrics are adopted for the three data sets. A discrimination metric evaluates how well the three classes can be distinguished within the frequency range 0. 1 - 1. 0 THz using the above algorithms...|$|E
40|$|The {{soluble protein}} {{fraction}} prepared from mandelate grown cells of Pseudomonas fluorescens {{as described in}} a previous paper (Gunsalus et al., 1953) contains four enzymes which {{are involved in the}} conversion of <b>DL-mandelic</b> <b>acid</b> to benzoic acid. These are: mandelic acid racemase, benzoyl-formic carboxylase, and two benzaldehyde dehydrogenases, linked respectively to diphos-phopyridine nucleotide (DPN) and triphospho-pyridine nucleotide (TPN). This paper describes the separation of these four enzyme activities and some of their properties. METHODS Assays. Benzoylformic carboxylase was assayed manometrically by measuring the rate of carbon dioxide evolution from benzoylformic acid at pH 6. 0 and 30 C. The test system contained 100 ug of cocarboxylase, 50 iM of sodium benzoyl-formate, and phosphate buffer (0. 1 M, pH 6. 0) sufficient to give a total volume of 2. 5 ml. Measurements were usually made in air, but crude extracts still containing the particle frac-tion were assayed in nitrogen to preclude oxida-tion of the benzaldehyde formed. The rate of decarboxylation is a linear function of enzyme concentration over the measurable range. The unit of activity is defined as the amount of en-zyme which decarboxylates one micromole of benzoylformic acid per hour under the specified conditions. Mandelic acid racemase was assayed by an indirect mrnometric method, that is, by deter-mining the rate of oxygen uptake by washed particles (L(+) -mandelate dehydrogenase) with D-mandelic acid as substrate in the presence o...|$|E
40|$|A {{structurally}} novel candidate microbicide, PPCM, {{which is}} formed from {{the reaction of}} <b>d,l-mandelic</b> <b>acid</b> with sulfuric acid, provides activity against human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and herpes simplex virus (HSV) and is not cytotoxic. The objectives of the current studies were to comprehensively evaluate the activity of PPCM in cell and explant cultures, explore the possibility of combining PPCM with HIV-specific reverse transcriptase inhibitors, and evaluate the efficacy of a formulated gel against genital herpes in a murine model. PPCM inhibited infection by laboratory and clinical R 5 and X 4 clade B and clade C HIV strains in cell culture. Ectocervical and endocervical tissue explants exposed to HIV- 1 BaL {{in the presence of}} PPCM were protected (50 % inhibitory concentrations [IC 50] of 3. 9 μg/ml for ectocervix and 3. 1 μg/ml for endocervix), and transfer of virus to target T cells via migratory cells was significantly impaired (IC 50 of 35. 7 μg/ml for ectocervix and 54. 6 μg/ml for endocervix). The drug also blocked infection by cell-associated virus. Combinations of PPCM with UC- 781 or PMPA in vitro exhibited additive anti-HIV activity. PPCM was incorporated into stable, low-pH gel formulations at concentrations of 0. 4 % and 4 %. Both gels prevented genital herpesvirus infection in mice, even when virus was introduced in human seminal plasma. The abilities of PPCM to inhibit primary HIV isolates, reduce infection by cell-associated virus, and transfer of HIV from migratory to T cells, combined with the complete protection provided by formulated gel against genital herpes, indicate that this drug is an excellent candidate for inclusion in a combination microbicide and would provide protection against both HIV and HSV...|$|E
40|$|The {{properties}} of biodegradable lactic acid based poly(ester-urethanes), PEU, were chemically and physically modified and the structure-property relationships investigated. The heat resistance of PEU was improved by copolymerization of lactic acid with <b>DL-mandelic</b> <b>acid.</b> The {{glass transition temperature}} of poly(L-lactic acid-co-DL-mandelic acid-urethanes) showed a marked increase with increased mandelic acid composition. Molecular weight depression was attributed to the steric hindrance of the bulky phenyl group of mandelic acid. Novel biodegradable and thermoplastic poly(ester-urethane) elastomers were synthesized by the copolymerization of lactic acid and ε-caprolactone. Properties, such as glass transition temperature and mechanical properties were strongly dependent on {{the composition of the}} copolymer. Small amounts of ε-caprolactone increased the strain of PEU, and at higher caprolactone content the poly(L-lactic acid-co-ε-caprolactone-urethane), P(LA/CL) U, exhibited elastomeric properties, having lower strength but significant elongation. The rheological {{properties of}} PEU were enhanced by modification {{of the structure of the}} polymer chains. An increase in the amount of 1, 6 -hexamethylene diisocyanate (HMDI) as a chain extender caused branching, which was revealed by the broadened MWD and increased shear thinning at low frequencies. The chain linking technology for lactic acid prepolymers was further developed with the use of highly effective carboxyl and hydroxyl reactive chain extenders. Reaction between 2, 2 '-bis(2 -oxazoline) (BOX) and the carboxyl groups of the lactic acid oligomer led to a hydroxyl terminated prepolymer with low acid value, which provided a significant increase in molecular weight in the HMDI linking reaction. The introduction of oxamide groups into the polymer structure increased the chain stiffness, which was detected in enhanced mechanical properties and an increase in the glass transition temperature. The impact strength of poly(ester-urethane) was significantly improved by blending. The toughening was achieved with a finely dispersed P(LA/CL) U or copoly(L-lactide/ε-caprolactone) elastomer phase in the matrix PEU. Tensile modulus and strength showed a downward trend as a function of rubber content but remained at an acceptable level. Good compatibility and interactions at the rubber-matrix interface were observed. The relationship between phase separation and mechanical properties of rubber-toughened blends was investigated. Composition of the elastomer, i. e. ε-caprolactone content, was found to determine the formation of the heterophase structure. The degree of crosslinking in the P(LA/CL) U rubber was another important factor in the impact modification. Furthermore, the balance between impact strength and stiffness of the poly(ester-urethane) composites was considerably improved by the addition of particulate or fibrous fillers as a third component. reviewe...|$|E
