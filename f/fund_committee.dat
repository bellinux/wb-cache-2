In recognition of their bravery, on 26 July 1875, the Governor of South Australia, Sir Anthony Musgrave, presented passengers James Fitzgerald and John Cleland and crewman Robert Brazil with gold medals and a gold watch.

5|$|Krueger {{retired to}} San Antonio, Texas, where, in February 1946, {{he bought a}} house for the first time. Because of a large income tax bill {{left over from the}} war, he was unable to buy it {{outright}} and so some of his friends established the Krueger <b>Fund</b> <b>Committee,</b> which paid for much of the house. In retirement, Krueger was involved in a number of charity and community organizations, including the United Service Organization, the Red Cross, and the National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis, and he served as director of civil defense for San Antonio and Bexar County.|$|E
5|$|Seeing {{that the}} Chinese {{military}} was weaker than the superior Japanese forces, Tan stepped up his anti-Japanese campaign. In 1936, he raised {{enough money for}} the Chinese Air Force to purchase 13 fighter planes. In 1937, the Chinese Relief <b>Fund</b> <b>Committee</b> was set up with Tan chosen by over 800 representatives of the Chinese community as its chairman. In response to the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, the China Salvation Movement was born, with its Southeast Asian headquarters located at the club until 1942, when the Japanese invaded Singapore. Tan fled to Indonesia {{just a few days}} before the fall of Singapore as he knew he would likely face persecution by the Japanese should he choose to remain. He returned to Singapore after the war and continued to play an active role in community services and charity work before returning to China in 1950. He died at the age of 87 in Beijing on 12 August 1961 and was accorded a national funeral by the People's Republic of China government for his various contributions to society.|$|E

The new club was originally based at Bramall Lane and played its first inter-county match against Surrey at The Oval on 4, 5 & 6 June 1863. It was a rain-affected draw, evenly balanced. The foundation of Yorkshire effectively superseded Sheffield, which ceased to be an important team in its own right.|$|E

Pauling {{was a member of the}} Hixon <b>Fund</b> <b>Committee,</b> which decided to use the money to hold a symposium on cerebral mechanisms. Because they understood preparation for and running such a symposium would be difficult and would require a knowledgeable person, Pauling suggested Jeffress, whom the committee accepted, and who then lived for the year in the Paulings' house in Pasadena while Pauling and his family were at Oxford.|$|E
