5|$|Art {{historian}} Charles de Tolnay believed that, {{through the}} seductive <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> Adam, the left panel already shows God's waning influence upon {{the newly created}} earth. This view {{is reinforced by the}} rendering of God in the outer panels as a tiny figure in comparison to the immensity of the earth. According to Belting, the three inner panels seek to broadly convey the Old Testament notion that, before the Fall, there was no defined boundary between good and evil; humanity in its innocence was unaware of consequence.|$|E
5|$|Ra's {{enemies are}} {{the forces of}} chaos, which {{threaten}} maat, the cosmic order that he creates. They include both humans who spread disorder and cosmic powers like Apep, the embodiment of chaos, whom Ra and the gods who accompany him in his barque are said to combat every night. The malevolent <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> Apep's own Eye is a potent weapon against Ra, and Ra's Eye {{is one of the}} few powers that can counteract it. Some unclear passages in the Coffin Texts suggest that Apep was thought capable of injuring or stealing the Eye of Ra from its master during the combat. In other texts, the Eye's fiery breath assists in Apep's destruction. This apotropaic function of the Eye of Ra is another point of overlap with the Eye of Horus, which was similarly believed to ward off evil.|$|E

5|$|The emergentist {{coalition}} model {{suggests that}} children {{make use of}} multiple cues to successfully attach a novel label to a novel object. The word learning situation may offer an infant combinations of social, perceptual, cognitive, and linguistic cues. While a range of cues {{are available from the}} start of word learning, it may be the case that not all cues are utilized by the infant when they begin the word learning process. While younger children may only be able to detect a limited number of cues, older, more experienced word learners may be able to make use of a range of cues. For instance, young children seem to focus primarily on perceptual salience, but older children attend to the <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> caregivers and use the focus of caregivers to direct their word mapping. Therefore, this model argues that principles or cues may be present from the onset of word learning, but the use {{of a wide range of}} cues develops over time.|$|E
5|$|Chimpanzees {{are capable}} of {{actively}} locating objects that {{are the focus of}} another individual's attention by tracking the <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> others. They are not limited to following eye gaze to the first interesting object in their view. They use a number of different cues to engage in shared focus, including head movement and eye gaze. Infant chimpanzees start to follow tap, point, and head turn cues of an experimenter by nine months of age. By 13 months of age, they show following responses to glance cues without a head turn. There is no evidence to support that infant chimpanzees are able to use eye gaze alone as a cue for following responses. By 20 months of age, infant chimpanzees are able to follow an experimenter's cues to a target behind the chimpanzee but infant chimpanzees do not look back to the experimenter after looking at the target. Moving targets are more salient than stationary targets for infant chimpanzees. Chimpanzee infants are sensitive to faces which are gazing at them, but chimpanzees less than three to four years old only look within their visual field when using the experimenter's head turn as their cue.|$|E

40|$|We {{present an}} {{experiment}} examining effects <b>of</b> <b>gaze</b> on speech during three-person conversations. Understanding such effects {{is crucial for}} the design of teleconferencing systems and Collaborative Virtual Environments (CVEs). Previous findings suggest subjects take more turns when they experience more gaze. We evaluated whether this is because more gaze allowed them to better observe whether they were being addressed. We compared speaking behavior between two conditions: (1) in which subjects experienced gaze synchronized with conversational attention, and (2) in which subjects experienced random <b>gaze.</b> The amount <b>of</b> <b>gaze</b> experienced by subjects was a covariate. Results show subjects were 22 % more likely to speak when gaze behavior was synchronized with conversational attention. However, covariance analysis showed these results were due to differences in amount <b>of</b> <b>gaze</b> rather than synchronization <b>of</b> <b>gaze,</b> with correlations <b>of.</b> 62 between amount <b>of</b> <b>gaze</b> and amount <b>of</b> subject speech. Task performance was 46 % higher when gaze was synchronized. We conclude it is commendable to use synchronized gaze models when designing CVEs, but depending on task situation, random models generating sufficient amounts <b>of</b> <b>gaze</b> may suffice...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an algorithm that detects misunderstandings in collaborative {{work at a}} distance. It analyses the movements of collaborators’ eyes on the shared workspace, their utterances containing references about this workspace, {{and the availability of}} ’remote’ deictic gestures. This method is based on two findings: 1. participants look at the points they are talking about in their message; 2. their gazes are more dense around these points compared to other random looks in the same timeframe. The algorithm associates the distance between the <b>gazes</b> <b>of</b> the emitter and <b>gazes</b> <b>of</b> the receiver of a message with the probability that the recipient did not understand the message.

25|$|In 1972, {{art critic}} Leo Steinberg {{in his essay}} The Philosophical Brothel posited a wholly {{different}} explanation for {{the wide range of}} stylistic attributes. Using the earlier sketches—which had been ignored by most critics—he argued that far from evidence of an artist undergoing a rapid stylistic metamorphosis, the variety of styles can be read as a deliberate attempt, a careful plan, to capture the <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> the viewer. He notes that the five women all seem eerily disconnected, indeed wholly unaware of each other. Rather, they focus solely on the viewer, their divergent styles only furthering the intensity of their glare.|$|E

Harrison concludes his 1992 film-poem by making a proposal that in the 1994 European Union summit in Corfu, Heine's statue be returned to Corfu on time to preside over the new Europe so that EU can keep its eyes open and not turn to stone from the Gorgon's gaze.|$|E

Christ's feet appear to be still nailed together, while the spread of His arms retains the position of His body on the Cross. Christ's body is shown as if held out for the concentrated <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> the viewer. Joseph of Arimathea looks across the body towards the skull of Adam. Joseph appears as a sumptuously dressed burgher and has the most portrait-like appearance of the figures in the painting; his gaze links the hands of Christ and his mother, the new Adam and Eve, with the skull of Adam. Thereby visualising the essence of the Redemption.|$|E

25|$|A lesser known {{story from}} the Brahma Vaivarta Purana narrates a {{different}} version of Ganesha's birth. On the insistence of Shiva, Parvati fasted for a year (punyaka vrata) to propitiate Vishnu {{so that he would}} grant her a son. Vishnu, after the completion of the sacrifice, announced that he would incarnate himself as her son in every kalpa (eon). Accordingly, Ganesha was born to Parvati as a charming infant. This event was celebrated with great enthusiasm and all the gods were invited {{to take a look at}} the baby. However Shani (Saturn), the son of Surya, hesitated to look at the baby since Shani was cursed with the <b>gaze</b> <b>of</b> destruction. However Parvati insisted that he look at the baby, which Shani did, and immediately the infant's head fell off. Seeing Shiva and Parvati grief-stricken, Vishnu mounted on Garuda, his divine eagle, and rushed to the banks of the Pushpa-Bhadra river, from where he brought back the head of a young elephant. The head of the elephant was joined with the headless body of Parvati's son, thus reviving him. The infant was named Ganesha and all the Gods blessed Ganesha and wished Him power and prosperity.|$|E

In the no-gesture condition, the teacher did not produce any hand gestures to the visual representations; however, she did <b>gaze</b> to elements <b>of</b> the graphs and equations when she spoke about them. In the gesture-to-graphs-only condition, the teacher pointed (and <b>gazed)</b> to elements <b>of</b> the graphs when she mentioned them during the lesson, {{but she did not}} point to the equations. Thus, she pointed and <b>gazed</b> to elements <b>of</b> the graphs, but only <b>gazed</b> to elements <b>of</b> the equations. In the gesture-to-equations-only condition, the teacher gestured to elements of the equations when she mentioned them during the lesson, but did not point to the graphs.
