Anthocyanin chromatographic analysis, color image analysis and near infrared hyperspectral imaging were carried out for the grapes. Then, a Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis (SLDA) was developed for each data set in order to discriminate grapes according to their grape variety. As a result, using anthocyanin profile, color image analysis and near infrared hyperspectral imaging respectively, 88 %, 54 % and 100 % of the samples were correctly classified in the internal validation process and 86 %, 52 % and 86 % were correctly classified in the leave-one-out cross-validation proces...|$|E

In this study, {{we looked}} at the yeast {{population}} present in four spontaneous alcoholic fermentations in the Rioja appellation (<b>D.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>Ca.</b> Rioja, Spain). The study was conducted through the identification of the yeasts via the PCR–RFLP technique of the ITS region of rDNA. In a first harvest, the qualitative diversity of the species present in spontaneous alcoholic fermentation was studied, and in a second harvest, their quantitative significance. In spontaneous fermentations, 17 different yeast species were found, although only two of them, Candida stellata and Kloeckera apiculata, as well as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, appeared in major proportions during fermentation. The significance of the non-Saccharomyces yeasts during the spontaneous alcoholic fermentation was conditioned by the presence of Saccharomyces cerevisiae in the medium. Species not cited in literature in connection with winemaking and yeasts associated with wines spoilage have been detected in all the alcoholic fermentations carried out in the qualitative study.

Nowadays, {{there is a growing}} demand of rapid and non-destructive analytical tools for analysing grapes, such as the emerging hyperspectral analysis. RESULTS: The hyperspectral images of intact grapes (Vitis vinifera L. cv. Tempranillo, Graciano, Garnacha and Mazuelo red grape from vineyards located in the <b>D.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>Ca.</b> Rioja at two different developmental stages) were recorded using a near infrared hyperspectral imaging device (900 – 1700 nm). Reference values of anthocyaninswere obtained by HPLC-DAD. Calibrationswere performed by modified partial least squares regression and present a good potential (coefficient of determination of 0. 72 and standard error of cross-validation values of 0. 78 and 0. 70 mg per grape for total and non-acylated anthocyanins respectively). CONCLUSION: The procedure reported here presents a good potential for a fast and reasonably inexpensive screening of these compounds in intact single berries. Moreover, the heterogeneity of anthocyanins within the same ripeness stage could be evaluated using this non-detructive tool...|$|E
40|$|The isotopic and {{chemical}} signatures for ice-age and Holocene ice from Summit, Greenland, and Penny Ice Cap, Baffin Island, Canada, are compared. The usual pattern of low <b>d</b> 18 <b>O,</b> high <b>Ca</b> 2 + and high Cl^ {{is presented in}} the Summit records, but Penny Ice Cap has lower than present Cl^ in its ice-age ice. A simple extension of the Hansson model (Hansson, 1994) is developed and used to simulate these signatures. The low iceage Cl^ from Penny Ice Cap is explained by having the ice-age ice originating many thousands of km inland near the centre of the Laurentide ice sheet and much further from the marine sources. Summit’s flowlines all start close to the present site. The Penny Ice Cap early-Holocene <b>d</b> 18 <b>O’s</b> had to be corrected to offset the Laurentide meltwater distortion.

40|$|Background and aims] Viral {{diseases}} in grapevines result in reduced vineyard performance, {{but it remains}} unclear to which extent some of their effects are direct or indirect, or if both kinds of effects co-occur. The aim of this work is to evaluate the effect of three virus diseases (GFLV, GLRaV and GFkV) on cv. Tempranillo. [Methods and results] A wide dataset that comprised yield components and grape composition of 531 cv. Tempranillo accessions for seven years was used, comparing their performance depending {{on the presence of}} each virus. GFLV showed the highest deleterious effects, followed by GLRaV- 3, whereas GFkV had no effect. GLRaV- 3 and, especially, GFLV effects were very relevant. [Conclusions] Regression analyses demonstrated that GFLV increases soluble solids (TSS) and colour density (CD) independently of yield reduction or advanced ripening, and causes higher pH independently of TSS. Similarly, GLRaV- 3 detrimental effect on CD is not caused only by delayed ripening, and higher pH is associated to imbalanced ripening. [Significance of the study] Our results highlight that a detailed analysis of a wide agronomic dataset allows a better understanding of virus diseases, unveiling to which extent some of their effects are direct or indirect.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{presence}} of different yeasts in the facilities of four wineries from the <b>D.</b> <b>O.</b> <b>Ca.</b> Rioja region in Spain. The study was conducted through the identification of the yeasts via the PCR-RFLP technique of the ITS region of rDNA. The diversity of non-Saccharomycesyeasts found in wineries has previously only been studied to a limited extent, despite the fact that these yeasts take part both in the start of spontaneous fermentation and in the changes which occur in the wines during their subsequent conservation. Most earlier studies carried out on cellar ecosystems have focussed on the clonal diversity of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The results obtained in this study indicated that the presence of non-Saccharomycesyeasts in facilities is higher than that of the S. cerevisiae, with percentages of over 60 % in all the wineries analyzed. Yeasts belonging to 10 genera and 18 species were isolated, but the only genera present in all four wineries were Cryptococcus, Pichia, and Saccharomyces. The Zygosaccharomyces bailiiyeast responsible for taint was detected in one cleaned winery, in both the winemaking equipment and the fermenting must. It was also noted that the quantity and type of yeasts present in the facilities are related to the product used for cleaning them. It is also necessary to point out that the cleaning of the cellars prior to the reception of the grapes does not completely eliminate the yeasts present, so that these can subsequently become part of the vinification process. This research received funding from the Government of La Rioja, Spain, and was carried out with the collaboration of four wineries that allowed us the use of their equipment for the study: Cooperativa de Alcanadre, Viña Ijalba, Torre de Oña and Bodegas Bilbainas.

Although {{the portion of the}} region close to the optimum sum s. <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. point is governed by the upper bounds due to secrecy constraints, the other portions of the region are governed by the upper bounds due to interference constraints.

We show that the unavailability of the eavesdropper's CSIT does not reduce the s. <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. of the wiretap channel with helpers. However, there is loss in s. <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. for both the multiple access wiretap channel and the interference channel with an external eavesdropper. In particular, we show that in the absence of eavesdropper's CSIT, the K-user multiple access wiretap channel reduces to a wiretap channel with (K- 1) helpers from a sum s. <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. perspective, and the optimal sum s. <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. reduces from K(K- 1) /K(K- 1) + 1 to K- 1 /K. For the interference channel with an external eavesdropper, the optimal sum s. <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. decreases from K(K- 1) / 2 K- 1 to K- 1 / 2 {{in the absence of the}} eavesdropper's CSIT. Our results show that the lack of eavesdropper's CSIT does not have a significant impact on the optimal s. <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. for any of the three channel models, especially when the number of users is large. This implies that physical layer security can be made robust to the unavailability of eavesdropper CSIT at high signal to noise ratio (SNR) regimes by careful modification of the achievable schemes as demonstrated in this paper.

40|$|Abstract — We {{study the}} K-user Gaussian {{interference}} wiretap channel with N external eavesdroppers. All the transmitters, receivers and eavesdroppers {{have a single}} antenna each. We propose an achievable scheme to lower bound the secure degrees of freedom (<b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f.) for each transmitter-receiver pair. Our approach {{is based on the}} (real) interference alignment technique. Our achievable scheme not only aligns the interference at each receiver to prevent the <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. from vanishing, but also aligns the signals observed by the eavesdroppers to reduce the secrecy penalty.

40|$|Corals are {{important}} marine archives for high-resolution reconstructions of low-latitude climate variability in preinstrumental and historical periods. Herein, we present monthly-resolved records of <b>d</b> 18 <b>O</b> and Sr/ <b>Ca</b> for the 20 th century (1917 – 2007) from a Porites lutea colony from the Maldives (northwestern Indian Ocean). Previous studies of annual mean extension rates of this coral revealed a distinct dependency of coral growth on variations of sea surface temperature (SST) and hydraulic energy, driven by El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and southwest-ern Indian monsoon forcing. This enables {{the investigation of}} coral <b>d</b> 18 <b>O</b> and Sr/Ca ratios from the Maldives as archives of historical ENSO and Indian monsoon variability. Unlike other locations in the Indian Ocean, correlation of <b>d</b> 18 <b>O</b> and SST is weak (r 5 20. 42; p, 0. 001), suggesting interferences of SST and seawater <b>d</b> 18 <b>O</b> at the location.

40|$|Abstract—A Gaussian wiretap channel with a helper, i. e., a {{cooperative}} jammer, is considered and its secure {{degrees of freedom}} (s. <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f.) is computed. Previous work showed that the s. <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. is upper bounded by 1 2 in this model when all parties are equipped with one antenna each. In this paper, the more challenging scenario where the eavesdropper has multiple anten-nas is tackled. Relying on structured signaling and cooperative jamming, specifically, by real interference alignment, it is shown that s. <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f. of 1 2 is achievable irrespective {{of the number of}} antennas the eavesdropper may have as long as the cooperative jammer has the same number of antennas as the eavesdropper. The design insight revealed is that the price to pay for {{the increase in the number}} of antennas at the eavesdropper is an equivalent increase in the number of antennas at the cooperative jammer in order to maintain the same s. <b>d.</b> <b>o.</b> f.
