5|$|Deeply {{shocked and}} {{upset by the}} accident, Wilbur {{determined}} to make <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> flight demonstrations; in the ensuing days and weeks he set new records for altitude and duration. In January 1909 Orville and Katharine joined him in France, {{and for a time}} they were the three most famous people in the world, sought after by royalty, the rich, reporters and the public. The kings of Great Britain, Spain and Italy came to see Wilbur fly.|$|E
5|$|The Hokies were {{slightly}} more effective rushing the ball. In the ground game, seven different players carried {{the ball at}} least once, netting 135rushing yards. Branden Ore finished the game with 116yards, leading all rushers on both teams. That total put him just eightyards short of his second-straight 1,000-yard season. Ore's total is <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> {{when one considers that}} he had been suspended for the entire first quarter of the game, his place taken by backup rusher Kenny Lewis, Jr. Lewis finished the game with four carries for 22yards, and did not see much action after Ore entered the game {{at the beginning of the}} secondquarter.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} the games were played, there was no Komi (in modern era, Black's initial {{advantage}} of moving first is offset by komi of 6.5-7.5 points). Because Go Seigen held white most of the time, his record is <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> than it appears.|$|E

He is disquieted by the discovery that Batman does still exist, however, and appears to be <b>even</b> <b>more</b> powerful and <b>impressive</b> than he ever was. Further evidence that something is very wrong comes when Bruce attempts to read first a newspaper and then a book from his personal library, discovering that the text is a garbled and unreadable mess.|$|R
25|$|Derbyshire were {{unchanged}} {{from their}} first Championship match, and the first day at the Parks left them at 225 for 8 at close. After recent rain in Oxford, and with a swinging ball in hand, the Oxford UCCE bowlers were commendably accurate. If 2 or 3 more catches had been taken, the scoreline would have looked <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> for the students.|$|E
25|$|<b>Even</b> <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> {{were the}} growing attendances at the Chicago Stadium where the Sting were outdrawing the Chicago Bulls (NBA) and fast {{catching}} up with the crowds pulled in by the Chicago Blackhawks (NHL). Besides the record crowd of 19,398 for the Tampa Bay Rowdies game, 18,374 saw the New York Cosmos game, 13,000 turned out for the regular season game against the Tulsa Roughnecks while 16,000 attended the playoff game against the Oklahoma side.|$|E
25|$|Boyd is {{typically}} {{defined as a}} goal poacher, whose key attribute is his strike rate. He scored {{an average of two}} goals for every three games when he arrived at Rangers; many of which came from the substitute bench, making his goals-to-games ratio <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>impressive.</b> He prefers to play in the penalty box, where he can play-off the shoulder of defenders who are close to their goals. Former Rangers manager Alex McLeish compared him to rival Ally McCoist in goalscoring ability.|$|E
50|$|After being {{ejected from}} Mario's castle in the {{previous}} game, Wario resolves to get his own castle, one <b>even</b> bigger and <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> than Mario's. To fund this extravagant dream, he travels to Kitchen Island, where the Brown Sugar Pirates have hidden many treasures and coins, including a golden statue of Princess Toadstool, stolen from the Mushroom Kingdom. Wario intends to retrieve this statue and sell it back to Mario {{for the price of}} a castle. After exploring the island, stealing the pirates' treasures, and infiltrating their Syrup Castle, Wario confronts the leader of the pirates, a female buccaneer named Captain Syrup. She summons a genie to destroy Wario, but he defeats the genie and Syrup destroys the castle with a large bomb as she escapes. In doing so, the pirates' biggest treasure is revealed: the giant gold statue of Princess Toadstool. However, Mario appears in a helicopter, thanks Wario and takes the statue away in front of his eyes.|$|R
40|$|Unprecedented {{progress}} has seen {{made in the}} last decade in the field of cancer immunotherapy. The recent approval of nivolumab (Opdivo), the first anti-programmed cell death- 1 (PD- 1) antibody, for metastatic melanoma in Japan, marked a milestone in the rapidly advancing field of cancer immunotherapy. Nivolumab together with ipilimumab (Yervoy 誖), the anti-cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen- 4 (CTLA- 4) antibody, are the first 2 drugs in the class of “immune checkpoint inhibitors ” that have delivered impressive responses in patients with metastatic melanoma and renal cell cancer (RCC) as well as a variety of solid tumors. The 3 -year survival rate of 22 % in patients with metastatic melanoma who received ipilimumab treatment represents a marked improvement in the management of this deadly disease[1]. <b>Even</b> <b>more</b> exciting, the <b>impressive</b> activity of ipilimumab has already been surpassed by other more active and potentially better tolerated immunotherapies, such as anti-PD- 1 /PD...|$|R
50|$|The Panamera Turbo S engine {{features}} larger turbochargers {{than the standard}} Panamera Turbo’s 4.8-litre V8, as well as high-pressure fuel injection, and aluminium-alloy pistons. The piston rings are coated in a low-friction surface to help eke out <b>even</b> <b>more</b> performance. The Panamera Turbo S accelerates to 62 mph in 3.8 seconds with launch control engaged. Roll-on acceleration should be <b>more</b> <b>impressive,</b> changes to the PDK (Porsche Doppelkupplung) gearbox allow for faster gearshifts, and the alleged 27.7mpg fuel economy is no worse than the less powerful Panamera Turbo.|$|R
25|$|Attendance at {{the renovated}} {{building}} rose significantly to 214,495 {{in just two}} months. In the past, both museums had drawn just 450,000 over 12 months. The achievement was <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> {{in the face of}} flat or declining attendance at all other Smithsonian museums. The higher attendance was not all positive. Some patrons spit on art they did not like, while others kissed or touched some paintings. Video security cameras were hastily installed in September 2007 to stop the vandalism. By the end of the year, more than 786,000 people had visited the two museums.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of December 2008, the R500 was featured on the popular BBC television show Top Gear, putting in a timed lap of the Top Gear circuit of 1 minute 17.9 seconds. This is, to date, the thirteenth fastest official lap timed by the show, faster than, amongst others, the Bugatti Veyron. This feat was considered <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> due to the coldness of the conditions which {{made it difficult for}} The Stig to get heat into the tyres. Shortly afterwards, on 14 December show, Top Gear made the R500 its '2008 Car of the Year'.|$|E
25|$|By 2009 Mexico ranked {{once again}} number 15 on World's leading {{exporters}} with US $230billion (And amongst {{the top ten}} excluding Intra-EU countries). Mexican trade is fully integrated with that of its North American partners: close to 90% of Mexican exports and 50% of its imports are traded with the United States and Canada. Nonetheless, NAFTA has not produced trade diversion. While trade with the United States increased 183% from 1993 to 2002, and that with Canada 165%, other trade agreements have shown <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> results: trade with Chile increased 285%, with Costa Rica 528% and Honduras 420%. Trade with the European Union increased 105% over the same time period.|$|E
50|$|With Stamford Harbor on the west-side of the point, and Westcott Cove to the east, {{boats were}} {{plentiful}} {{in the summer}} months. The Rev. Henry Codman Potter's yacht Pearl {{was one of the}} <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> sights at Stamford Harbor. A new steamer ship, The Shippan, was built in 1866. Some of these vessels ferried passengers to the newly opened Shippan resorts of Ennis and McDeavitt. The racetrack at the northeast end of the peninsula brought <b>even</b> <b>more</b> visitors, so in 1892 the Stamford Street Railway began trolley service to Shippan.|$|R

Nothing could be <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> than this scene--this silent but earnest appeal to the Most High by the man whom she suspected of murder--of crimes <b>even</b> <b>more</b> terrible. She could see his eyes, pleading and sincere, turned upward; could see his gray hair flutter in the breeze; could see his lips move, though they uttered no sound. And after he had poured out his heart to his Maker he extended his arms upon the slab, rested his head upon them and again became motionless.|$|R
25|$|In {{the best}} book on asthma of the 19th century, first {{published}} in 1860, the British physician and physiologist Henry Hyde Salter (1823–1871) included a chapter on treatment ″by stimulants″. Strong coffee was very helpful, presumably because it dispelled sleep, which favoured asthma. <b>Even</b> <b>more</b> <b>impressive,</b> however, was the response to ″strong mental emotion″: ″The cure of asthma by violent emotion is more sudden and complete than by any other remedy whatever; indeed, I know few things more striking and curious in {{the whole history of}} therapeutics. … The cure … takes no time; it is instantaneous, the intensest paroxysm ceases on the instant.″ ″Cure″ due to release of adrenaline from the adrenals is the retrospective interpretation.|$|E
25|$|Coleman kicked 537 {{goals in}} just 98 appearances, {{at an average}} of 5.48 goals per game. At the time of his retirement, it was the highest goals-per-game average by any player, {{exceeding}} the next-best total of Bob Pratt (4.31 goals per game) by more than a goal. Coleman's feats were <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> by virtue {{of the fact that he}} achieved them at a time when the rules of the game were less favourable to full-forwards: between 1925–1939, a free kick was always awarded against the last team to play the ball before it went out of bounds, which resulted in teams of the era adopting a direct game-plan which favoured strong full-forwards, and it was an era which produced many of the league's heaviest goalscorers, including Pratt, Gordon Coventry, Bill Mohr and Ron Todd; but Coleman played after the boundary throw-in had been re-introduced, resulting in more play along the wings and less prominence from full-forwards. As of 2014, Coleman's record has been surpassed by only Peter Hudson (5.64 goals per game).|$|E
25|$|However, having {{established}} himself as the best fast bowler in the world, {{at the end of}} the season Brearley announced that business claims would prevent him playing again. Although he changed his mind and did play five times for Lancashire in 1906 besides helping Neville Knox to form a remarkably hostile attack for the Gentlemen at Lord's, he refused to play again for his county until 1908. In 1907, Brearley only played a handful of first-class games for the Gentlemen and a couple of privately raised teams, but was still thought good enough to only just miss out on a Test place at Lord's against South Africa. 1908 saw Brearley end his dispute with the Lancashire committee and bowl superbly before business kept him out of most of the August matches. He took 148 wickets in just seventeen matches and was named a Cricketer of the Year by Wisden. In 1909 he was <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> so long as he could play, but failed in his only Test, and in the following two years business and a major accident limited him to just fourteen of Lancashire's fifty eight Championship games.|$|E

25|$|Prentice {{returned}} to Leicestershire after the Second World War, {{although he was}} thereafter handicapped to a degree by a bad fracture of the wrist he had sustained on war service. In a rather more mobile batting order, with competition for the opening places, Prentice often batted at No 3 {{in the first four}} post-war seasons, but passed 1000 runs in each of them. He bowled less after the war, and scarcely at all after 1947, but in 1946, despite the presence in the Leicestershire attack of Vic Jackson and Jack Walsh, he took five Gloucestershire wickets for 46 runs, and these were the best figures of his career. The 1948 and 1949 seasons were the best of his career as a batsman. In 1948, he scored 1328 runs at an average of 36.88 and headed the Leicestershire batting averages for the first and only time. His figures in 1949 were <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> – 1742 runs and an average of 38.71 – though he was beaten in the county's averages by Berry, who had been out of form in 1948. The 1949 record included five centuries before the end of June and the five included an innings of 191 against Nottinghamshire which was the highest of his career.|$|E
25|$|Roosevelt was {{a member}} of the New York State Assembly (New York Co., 21st D.) in 1882, 1883 and 1884. He {{immediately}} began making his mark, specifically in corporate corruption issues. He blocked a corrupt effort by financier Jay Gould to lower his taxes. Roosevelt exposed suspected collusion in the matter by Judge Theodore Westbrook, and argued for and received approval for an investigation to proceed, aiming for the impeachment of the judge. The investigation committee rejected impeachment, but Roosevelt had exposed the potential corruption in Albany, and thus assumed a high and positive political profile in multiple New York publications. Roosevelt's anti-corruption efforts helped him win re-election in 1882 by a margin greater than two-to-one, an achievement made <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>impressive</b> by the fact that Democratic gubernatorial candidate Grover Cleveland won Roosevelt's district. With Conkling's Stalwart faction of the Republican Party in disarray following the assassination of President James Garfield, Roosevelt won election as the Republican party leader in the state assembly. He allied with Governor Cleveland to win passage of a civil service reform bill. Roosevelt won re-election a second time, and sought the office of Speaker of the New York State Assembly, but was defeated by Titus Sheard in a 41 to 29 vote of the GOP caucus. In his final term, Roosevelt served as Chairman of the Committee on Affairs of Cities; he wrote more bills than any other legislator.|$|E
