40|$|In {{the midst}} of conflict, it 2 ̆ 7 s {{sometimes}} difficult {{to determine if the}} argument is hostile or actually a misunderstanding. However, according to Elaine Johannes, Kansas State University Extension family and community mental health specialist, if the conflict intentionally humiliates, degrades, belittles or antagonizes, there is no confusion whether or not the conflict comes from conversational style differences; it 2 ̆ 7 s definitely abuse. One theory that examines the lack of understanding between women and men is attributed to gender <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> the ways they speak. Problems may exist when couples ignore these <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> conversational styles. The differences are neither good or bad, but when they are taken to extremes they can be hurtful.

To encourage research and facilitate comparisons, the IRAGE editors proposed {{a series of questions}} on methodology and theory to researchers who are currently engaged in, or have completed, studies on IVF. 1. What are the basic findings of your IVF research? 2. Provide details of your research methodology, for example, how many women were <b>in</b> <b>your</b> study? How was the sample obtained? How did you obtain access? How did you measure success? 3. What conclusions do you draw from the research? 4. Do you see any <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>your</b> research and that of other feminists? If so, what are they? 5. Arising out of your research, what strategies for change do you advocate? 6.

5000|$|The {{last few}} years of Madarasz's life were spent in a {{business}} association in Goldfield, Nevada. It was there that health problems began to plague the penman. After a severe bout with pneumonia, Madarasz became diabetic and never regained his formally healthy physique. Quoting from The Secret of the Skill of Madarasz, a book published by the Zaner-Bloser Company in 1911 {{as a tribute to}} the great penman: [...] "He passed away quietly on December 23, 1910, having on the day he was stricken written a Christmas greeting in that beautiful clean cut style of penmanship which has been copied by so many thousand aspirants during the past thirty years." [...] At his request his body was cremated. His ashes rest in the beautiful columbarium at Fresh Pond, Long Island. [...] "The urn of Louis Madarasz is oxidized and not easy to read, no less in a photo. epitaph reads: (top) Dum Taget Clarat, (middle) In Memory of a Brave & Gentle Man Louis Madarasz January 20, 1860 - December 23, 1910...He put his house in order His Work was Done, (bottom) Here Rests a Woodman of the World" [...] Also in the niche behind Louis's urn is his wife Clara Kinstler and her husband Aaron A. Kinstler. The letter citing these facts is from the United States Columbarium, Fresh Pond Crematory 6140 Mount Olivet Crescent, Middle Village, NY 11379 dated February 9, 2010 addressed to Donald M. Tate 13528 S. Bella Monte Drive Draper, UT 84020. He is buried in Niche #1103 M.F.R.

40|$|In no {{more than}} a paragraph, compare one of Berkeley’s {{arguments}} against the ex-istence of infinitesimals in Sections 1 - 6 with his arguments against the existence of Lockean abstract ideas you read previously. Are there any obvious similarities and/or <b>differences?</b> • <b>In</b> <b>your</b> own words, summarize the following argument: For when it is said, let the Increments vanish, i. e. let the Increments be nothing, or let there be no Increments, the former Supposition that the In-crements were something, or that there were Increments, is destroyed, and yet a Consequence of that Supposition, i. e. an Expression got by virtue thereof, is retained. Which, by the foregoing Lemma, is a false way of reasoning. Certainly when we suppose the Increments to vanish, we must suppose their Proportions, their Expressions, and every thing else derived from the Supposition of their Existence to vanish with them.
