5|$|Kerry Conran {{grew up on}} {{films and}} comic books of the 1930s and 1940s. He and his brother, Kevin, were {{encouraged}} by their parents to develop their creative side at a young age. Kerry studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he {{realized that it was}} possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran had been out of film school for two years and was trying to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a movie. He figured that Hollywood would never take a chance on an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself.|$|E
25|$|A typical episode {{generally}} {{follows a}} simple formula: Beaver or Wally (or both) {{get into a}} scrape and then face their parents for a lecture regarding the event. Lectures sometimes {{take the form of}} fables, with Ward allowing the boys to discover their moral meanings and applying those meanings to their lives. Occasionally, when offenses are serious, punishments such as being grounded are dealt the miscreants. The parents are sometimes shown debating the best approach to the situation. Other episodes (especially in earlier seasons) even reverse the formula, with Ward making a parenting mistake and having to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up for it.|$|E
500|$|Joseph Gordon-Levitt as Arthur, Cobb's {{partner who}} manages and {{researches}} the missions. Gordon-Levitt compared Arthur to {{the producer of}} Cobb's art, [...] "the one saying, 'Okay, you have your vision; now I'm going to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> all {{the nuts and bolts}} work so you can do your thing'". The actor did all of his stunts but one scene and said the preparation [...] "was a challenge and {{it would have to be}} for it to look real". James Franco was in talks with Christopher Nolan to play Arthur, but was ultimately unavailable due to scheduling conflicts.|$|E

500|$|During {{production}} of the episode, the producers [...] "agonized" [...] over the teaser—due {{to the fact that}} it featured the death of a small child—as well as the darkness of the entire episode. Fox's standards and practices department took issues with Steve's strangulation scene; in the end, the sequence was left in the episode, but Steve's face was obscured to [...] "soften the impact". Although the episode's filming went along smoothly, the final cut [...] "didn't pass muster". Spotnitz explained that Carter [...] "spent a lot of time in the editing room trying to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this more terrifying." [...] Spotnitz later noted that Carter's dedication impacted his work ethic and proved that something could be so [...] "much better [...] if you didn't give up." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "All Is Full of Love" [...] was {{directed}} by Chris Cunningham. Björk was impressed by Cunningham's original music videos for IDM musicians Autechre, Squarepusher, and Aphex Twin, and by his clear lines, science fiction inclinations, and discordant imagery. This resulted in the singer contacting him to meet at his London office; she brought Chinese Kama Sutra {{as a guide to}} what she wanted. Cunningham had also associated the track with sex upon hearing it, but could not <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the video explicit yet broadcastable. Regarding this, the singer confessed, [...] "I think the only thing I said was that I thought it was very white [...] and I'm trying to describe some sort of a heaven. But I wanted also to have the other level there, there would be lust, it wouldn't be just clean". She complemented saying she mentioned that the video should be [...] "white" [...] and [...] "frozen", and then it [...] "melts because of love" [...] and [...] "making love".|$|E
500|$|... "Something There" [...] {{was written}} by lyricist Howard Ashman and {{composer}} Alan Menken. According to Menken, [...] "Something There" [...] was written as [...] "a very quick replacement for ... 'Human Again'," [...] the latter of which was ultimately cut from Beauty and the Beast because it was considered [...] "too ambitious" [...] for the film. Eleven minutes in length, producer Don Hahn explained that the song was cut because [...] "We just couldn't <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it work and not {{take away from the}} central story of Belle." [...] Upon learning that [...] "Human Again" [...] was removed from Beauty and the Beast, Ashman and Menken were forced to return [...] "to the drawing board to write something more contained and simple," [...] the ultimate result of which was the love song [...] "Something There," [...] which has been described as [...] "shorter and more direct" [...] than [...] "Human Again". The creative team had originally believed that the Beast saving Belle from the wolves was enough to justify the dance sequence {{near the end of the}} film, though later realised they had in fact not yet earned this moment; this quiet song where Beast gives Belle his library was pitched and written by Howard Ashman and [...] "as soon as that was written, we knew the movie was going to work".|$|E

A survey of students assigned to use a MediaWiki-based wiki found that when they were asked an open question about main problems with the wiki, 24% cited technical problems with formatting, e.g. [...] "Couldn't <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> get an image in.

500|$|... "I Am the Walrus" [...] was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews from critics. Rowan Kaiser of The A.V. Club gave the episode a positive review. In his review for the episode, he opined: [...] "The episode itself didn't disappoint either, as [...] this was a quality half-hour of jokes. Kaiser praised the argument between Stan and Steve, calling it a [...] "superb sequence". Concluding his review, Kaiser went on to write, [...] "Despite all the absurdity, the episode even manages to successfully come around to an emotional resolution when Stan, realizing that Steve is an utter failure at attempted mating, resolves to see Steve as a son instead of potential masculine competition. Then [...] there's a rape joke. But, it being American Dad, it's actually a surprisingly funny rape joke." [...] He went on to give the episode an [...] "A-", scoring higher than The Simpsons episode [...] "Love Is a Many Strangled Thing", but scoring lower than Bob's Burgers episode [...] "Spaghetti Western and Meatballs". Jason Hughes of TV Squad also reacted positively, writing, [...] "It was good to have American Dad back in the lineup. Roger was in fine form, and I can at least appreciate that they're trying to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Hayley and Jeff work in the family dynamic. They never quite got there with Hayley alone, so maybe things will work better this way." [...] However, he was more critical on the sub-plot. In his review for the episode, Hughes opined: [...] "The B-story left me wanting. The writers {{are still trying to}} figure out the new dynamic of having Hayley married and Jeff living in the house with the Smiths. The whole thing has been barely addressed, and this week we got a fairly weak exploration of them having fairly standard marital problems." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{choosing}} {{candidates for}} the Tatsunoko and Capcom character rosters, the development team was free to nominate any character it wished. However, the team faced limitations on its Tatsunoko candidates; Niitsuma explained, [...] " [...] had to consider licensing issues. Once we had that list we had to <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a balanced fighting game. On top of that we wanted a good balance {{between male and female}} characters." [...] Selection emphasis was placed on main characters, rather than on villains. Certain characters were denied by Tatsunoko Production without explanation to Capcom. [...] "We weren't privy to a lot of their decision making process. They didn't share a lot of reasons with us. When they said no and we asked why, they wouldn't tell us, but would give us another suggestion," [...] Niitsuma said. They disallowed characters from Genesis Climber MOSPEADA or Samurai Pizza Cats, despite the high number of fan requests for the latter. The eponymous characters of Tatsunoko's Muteking, The Dashing Warrior and Nurse Witch Komugi were among those planned for inclusion, but were eventually scrapped. The finalized Tatsunoko cast consists of characters that the team enjoyed in their youth. The development team hoped to include Capcom's Phoenix Wright and Franziska von Karma from the Ace Attorney series, but, while the latter's use of a whip made her easy to incorporate, the team struggled to find appropriate attacks for Phoenix. Since Phoenix doesn't move from the waist down in his original game environment, the team considered adding tires to his desk and having the entirety move as a single character. However, this was abandoned due to potential collision issues. Though they envisioned an attack that used his catch-phrase [...] "", with the letters themselves used to attack the opponent, they found that localization would have changed the Japanese four-character phrase (in kanji) to a ten-letter word in English, unbalancing the game. Arthur from Ghosts 'n Goblins, and Ingrid from Capcom Fighting Evolution were also scrapped.|$|E
2500|$|Before {{directing}} {{his first}} feature, Spanking the Monkey, Russell {{intended to make}} a film [...] "about a guy who sits {{in the back of a}} Chinese restaurant with microphones on every table to surreptitiously listen to everybody’s conversations, then write perversely personal fortunes for each of the people." [...] Hitting a writer's block, Russell could not <b>figure</b> <b>out</b> <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the film work. In the meantime Russell was called for jury duty, after which he stopped writing the film. Ideas in the script stayed with him though and they would later form the basis for the Huckabee script. The final idea came to Russell in a dream where [...] "This female detective she was not following me for criminal reasons, but she was following me for spiritual and metaphysical reasons." [...] Russell, who makes a habit of writing his dreams down, knew instantly upon reading his summary of the dream that this was the story he wanted to pursue.|$|E
