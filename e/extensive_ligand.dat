Although the exact mechanism of action of these gold(I) drugs for RA has not been clearly established, the interaction of these compounds with mammalian enzymes has been extensively studied. In this paper, we describe the interaction of therapeutic gold(I) compounds with mammalian proteins that contain cysteine (Cys) and selenocysteine (Sec) residues. Owing to the higher affinity of gold(I) towards sulfur and selenium, gold(I) drugs rapidly react with the activated cysteine or selenocysteine residues of the enzymes to form protein-gold(I) -thiolate or protein-gold(I) -selenolate complexes. The formation of stable gold(I) -thiolate/selenolate complexes generally lead to inhibition of the enzyme activity. The gold-thiolate/selenolate complexes undergo <b>extensive</b> <b>ligand</b> exchange reactions with other nucleophiles and such ligand exchange reactions alter the inhibitory effects of gold(I) complexes. Therefore, the effect of gold(I) compounds on the enzymatic activity of cysteine-or selenocysteine-containing proteins may play important roles in RA.

Evidence for the accumulation of the transition metal in the cell nucleus suggests DNA as one of the major targets. However, the characteristics of the interaction between different types of metallocenes and nucleic acids remain largely unknown. The progress of this therapeutic approach comprises the development of cyclopentadienyl-modified metallocenes and precise knowledge of their interaction with the target. Tandem mass spectrometry is the ideal method to investigate the formation of metallodrug adducts and to elucidate nucleobase selectivity and binding. In this study, four different metallocenes were incubated with eight dinucleotide monophosphates (AT, TA, CG, GC, CT, TC, AG, GA) to elucidate the favored binding sites.

40|$|The unique G-quadruplex {{secondary}} structures {{formed from}} guanine-rich DNA are implicated as anti-cancer targets {{for their ability}} to inhibit overactive DNA polymerase and aberrant gene expression. As the body's natural on-off switch for controlling cell life cycles, stabilisation of G-quadruplex by external ligands can reduce cellular dysfunction. Despite the extensive research on G-quadruplex stabilising agents, few ligands have reached clinical trials and moved further onto the market. Selectivity and potency issues can hinder this process. Through rational design, we developed three series of ligands to enhance potency, selectivity, and cell permeability: two aromatic planar series targeting G-tetrads, and one groove-binding series targeting a c-kit G-quadruplex groove site. For the first series, we used Schrodinger's Glide molecular docking software and an arbitrary selection of ligands from an <b>extensive</b> <b>ligand</b> database to perform a virtual screen on the ckit 1 groove site. Results showed triangular ligands such as triarylpyridines and triarylpyrimidines were potent groove-binding ligands. From these docking results, we synthesised two 4 '-substituted 2, 2 : 6, 2 "-terpyridine derivatives and purchased three 2, 2 : 6, 2 "-terpyridine ligands with reported low G-quadruplex selectivity as negative controls for surface plasmon resonance (SPR) analysis. In the second series, the parallel synthesis of linear, crescent, and triangular-shaped arylcarboxamides through amide coupling allowed the development of an <b>extensive</b> <b>ligand</b> library to ascertain the best pharmacophore for specific G-quadruplex structures. Initial attempts to synthesise a crescent 1 -(4 -aminophenyl) guanidine derivative was successful, however the method used was not transferrable to the linear and triangular counterparts. Following an alternate literature method, aniline and 3 -aminopyridine derivatives were synthesised through isolation from a reagent, sym-collidine, appeared difficult. Using this method the linear 1 -(4 -aminophenyl) guanidine derivative was synthesised, though only intermediates were isolated for triangular derivative. The third series, we postulated triazolophane macrocycles to bind to G-tetrad surface due to its high planarity and aromaticity. A rationally designed triazolophane was devised with a pyridyl-based core featuring propylguanidine groups through ester and ether appendages for enhanced binding with the DNA backbone. The multistep synthesis of phenyl diazide and pyridyl dialkyne building blocks has thus far been fruitless as ideal "click" conditions are yet to be discovered for full triazolophane synthesis. Finally, SPR analysis of a model triazolophane, the crescent guanidine-based arylcarboxamide, and the five terpyridine ligands provided the impetus for further G-quadruplex ligand development. The terpyridine series showed no selectivity for cki 1 and its groove site, or preference for G-quadruplex DNA - alternative molecular docking programs are required to determine an ideal ckitl-specific groove binding agent. Both the arylcarboxamide and model triazolophane displayed G-quadruplex selective binding - these positive results supports the full development of our arylcarboxamide ligand database and further analysis for the development of triazolophane macrocycles.

It remains {{important to understand}} apo-LBD conformation {{and the way that}} it rearranges with ligands to develop better TR pharmaceuticals. In this study, we conducted hydrogen/deuterium exchange on TR LBDs with or without agonist (T- 3) or antagonist (NH 3). Both ligands reduce deuterium incorporation into LBD amide hydrogens, implying tighter overall folding of the domain. As predicted, mass spectroscopic analysis of individual proteolytic peptides after hydrogen/deuterium exchange reveals that ligand increases the degree of solvent protection of regions close to the buried ligand-binding pocket. However, there is also <b>extensive</b> <b>ligand</b> protection of other regions, including the dimer surface at H 10 -H 11, providing evidence for allosteric communication between the ligand-binding pocket and distant interaction surfaces. Surprisingly, C-terminal activation helix H 12, which is known to alter position with ligand, remains relatively protected from solvent in all conditions suggesting that it is packed against the LBD irrespective of the presence or type of ligand.

Attempts to synthesize heteroleptic iodide-containing species led to the isolation of the homoleptic compounds [{H 2 B(ImtBu) 2 } 2 MTHF) n] (M = Ca, n = 1; M = Sr, n = 2) most likely because of the reduced steric demands of the halide coligand. Although extension of the “one pot” synthetic method to precursors containing N-mesityl-substituted imidazoles resulted in <b>extensive</b> <b>ligand</b> degradation, use of [Ca{N(SiMe 3) 2 } 2 (THF) 2] as both base and group 2 element source provided the target heteroleptic silylamide complex. X-ray diffraction analyses demonstrated that the borate ligands adopt a facial η 3 -binding mode in which coordination is provided through the two N-heterocyclic carbene (NHC) donors and an additional agostic-type interacton from one hydrogen of the BH 2 residue. Analysis of this ligand binding by DFT methods indicates that, although the bonds from the carbon centers are similar in character to those provided by neutral NHC ligands, the bonding is supplemented by an electrostatic component which is manifested as a coordination of a hydridic BH bond.

40|$|The overall aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} strategies {{to aid in the}} measurement of G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) activity for high-throughput screening and sensing applications. GPCRs are cell surface receptors which have seven membrane spanning domains. They are the largest family of membrane proteins in the human genome and are involved in a number of physiological and pathophysiological pathways. They are the most widely targeted protein family for therapeutics being the target for over 30 % of the currently available prescription drugs (Jacoby et al. 2006). For this reason commercial interest and investment into compound screening using these receptors as targets is of high importance in lead drug discovery. Additionally, the <b>extensive</b> <b>ligand</b> range of the GPCR superfamily, which includes light, odorants/ volatiles, neurotransmitters and hormones, make them an attractive biological recognition element in biosensor applications. This thesis demonstrates the functional expression of the H 1 -histamine, M 2 -muscarinic and α₂ₐ-adrenergic receptors of the G-protein coupled receptor family, along with their associated G-proteins (Gα, Gβ and Gγ). Expression was achieved using the Sf 9 /baculovirus expression system. The G-proteins were successfully incorporated into an assay system using time-resolved fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TRFRET). TR-FRET was used {{in order to create a}} homogeneous assay format capable of monitoring GPCR activation through the movement of the G-protein subunits. Fluorescence changes in the TR-FRET assay indicated a change in distance between the Gα subunit and Gβγ dimer. The separation of the Gα subunit and the Gβγ dimer after activation resulted in a significant decrease in TR-FRET measurement. The homogeneous set-up of the TR-FRET assay could potentially be adaptable to an array based format. This thesis describes the capture of vesicles containing functional GPCRs onto a solid substrate via the specific interaction between complementary oligonucleotides. GPCR presence and function within the immobilized vesicles, was demonstrated using fluorescent ligands.

The specific significant achievements of the current grant period include: 1) we have performed magnetic and computational studies on (terpyridine) NiMe, an active catalyst for alkyl-alkyl cross couplings, and have discovered that the unpaired electron resides heavily on the terpyridine ligand and that the proper electronic description of this nickel complex is a Ni(II) -methyl cation bound to a reduced terpyridine ligand; 2) we have for the first time shown that alkyl halide reduction by terpyridyl nickel catalysts is substantially ligand based; 3) we have shown by isotopic labeling studies that the active catalyst (terpyridine) NiMe is not produced via a mechanism that involves the formation of methyl radicals when (TMEDA) NiMe 2 is used as the catalyst precursor; 4) we have performed an <b>extensive</b> <b>ligand</b> survey for the alkyl-alkyl cross-coupling reactions and have found that electronic factors only moderately influence reactivity in the terpyridine-based catalysis and that the most dramatic effects arise from steric and solubility factors; 5) we have found that the use of bis(dialkylphosphino) methanes as ligands for nickel does not produce active catalysts for cross-coupling but rather leads to bridging hydride complexes of varying geometries; 6) we have determined that the geometry of aforementioned bridging hydride complexes is largely determined by external forces such as hydrogen bonding interactions and crystal packing forces; 7) we have found that the rate of reductive elimination of alkane from a (pyridyl- 2 -pyrrolide) AuMe 2 complex is severely inhibited due to the rigid geometry of the pyridyl- 2 -pyrrolide ligand; 8) we have prepared, structurally characterized, and explored the reactivity of 1 -adamantylzinc reagents as model nucleophiles for sterically challenging alkyl-alkyl cross-coupling reactions. The continued success of this work will lead to alkyl-alkyl cross-coupling catalysts with broad scope and selectivities. The work has potential to significantly impact science and technologies of interest to the DOE as the chemistry is focused on developing useful reactions using reagents that can be directly prepared from petroleum and natural gas feedstocks. Moreover, the developing synthetic chemistry can profoundly affect the way materials, fine chemicals, and drugs are made. Since the methodology we are developing can shorten existing synthetic protocols, proceed at room temperature, and operate under environmentally benign conditions, it can greatly reduce energy expenditures, especially considering the contribution of the chemical manufacturing field to the gross domestic product...|$|E

40|$|Designing bioresponsive nanocarriers for {{controlled}} and efficient intracellular drug release {{for cancer therapy}} is a major thrust area in nanomedicine. With recent recognition by the US FDA as a safe material for human trials, mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNPs) are being extensively explored as promising theranostic agents. Green fluorescent carbon quantum dots (CQDs), though known as possible alternatives for their more toxic and relatively less efficient predecessors, are less known as gate keepers for drug release control. We report {{for the first time}} an efficient bioresponse of CQDs when judiciously designed using glutathione cleavable (redox responsive) disulphide bonds. When the anticancer drug doxorubicin loaded MSNPs are capped with these CQDs, they display promising drug release control on exposure to a mimicked intracellular cancer environment. Their dual functionality is well established with good control on preventing the premature release and exceptional bio-imaging of HeLa cancer cells. Fluorescence images prove selective targeting of HeLa cells by overexpression of folate receptors from the surface functionalised folic acid <b>ligand.</b> <b>Extensive</b> characterisation using XRD, TEM, BET analysis, drug loading tests, drug release kinetics, MTT assay and fluoroscence cell imaging helps in understanding the multi-functionalities of the successful design, extending its scope with exciting prospects towards non-invasive targeted drug delivery and bio-imaging for effective cancer diagnosis and treatment...|$|R
40|$|International audienceHeptahelical receptors {{communicate}} extracellular {{information to}} the cytosolic compartment by binding an <b>extensive</b> variety of <b>ligands.</b> They do so through conformational changes that propagate to intracellular signaling partners as the receptor switches from a resting to an active conformation. This active state has been classically considered unique and responsible for regulation of all signaling pathways controlled by a receptor. However, recent functional studies have challenged this notion {{and called for a}} paradigm where receptors would exist in more than one signaling conformation. This study used bioluminescence resonance energy transfer assays in combination with ligands of different functional profiles to provide in vivo physical evidence of conformational diversity of delta-opioid receptors (DORs). DORs and alpha(i 1) beta(1) gamma(2) G protein subunits were tagged with Luc or green fluorescent protein to produce bioluminescence resonance energy transfer pairs that allowed monitoring DOR-G protein interactions from different vantage points. Results showed that DORs and heterotrimeric G proteins formed a constitutive complex that underwent structural reorganization upon ligand binding. Conformational rearrangements could not be explained by a two-state model, supporting the idea that DORs adopt ligand-specific conformations. In addition, conformational diversity encoded by the receptor was conveyed to the interaction among heterotrimeric subunits. The existence of multiple active receptor states has implications for the way we conceive specificity of signal transduction...|$|R
40|$|Vibrational {{circular}} dichroism (VCD) spectroscopic {{measurements and}} density functional theory (DFT) calculations {{have been used}} to obtain the absolute structural information about four sets of diastereomers of pentacoordinate spirophosphoranes derived separately from L- (or D-) valine and L- (or D-) leucine for the first time. Each compound contains three stereogenic centers: one at the phosphorus center and two at the amino acid <b>ligands.</b> <b>Extensive</b> conformational searches for the compounds have been carried out and their vibrational absorption (VA) and VCD spectra have been simulated at the B 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++ G** level. Although both VA and VCD spectra are highly sensitive to the structural variation of the apical axis, that is, the O-P-O or N-P-O arrangement, the rotamers generated by the aliphatic amino side chains show little effect on both. The dominant experimental VCD features in the 1100 - 1500 cm(- 1) region were found to be controlled by the chirality at the phosphorus center, whereas those at the C=O stretching region are determined by the chirality of the amino acid ligands. The good agreement between the experimental VA and VCD spectra in CDCl 3 solution and the simulated ones allows us to assign the absolute configurations of these pentacoordinate phosphorus compounds with high confidence. This study shows that the VCD spectroscopy complemented with DFT calculations is a powerful and reliable method for determining the absolute configurations and dominating conformers of synthetic phosphorus coordination complexes in solution.

40|$|NKG 2 D is an {{activating}} receptor expressed on {{the surface}} of natural killer (NK) cells, CD 8 (+) T cells, and subsets of CD 4 (+) T cells, invariant NKT cells (iNKT), and γδ T cells. In humans, NKG 2 D transmits signals by its association with the DAP 10 adapter subunit, and in mice alternatively spliced isoforms transmit signals either using DAP 10 or DAP 12 adapter subunits. Although NKG 2 D is encoded by a highly conserved gene (KLRK 1) with limited polymorphism, the receptor recognizes an <b>extensive</b> repertoire of <b>ligands,</b> encoded by at least eight genes in humans (MICA, MICB, RAET 1 E, RAET 1 G, RAET 1 H, RAET 1 I, RAET 1 L, and RAET 1 N), some with extensive allelic polymorphism. Expression of the NKG 2 D ligands is tightly regulated at the level of transcription, translation, and posttranslation. In general, healthy adult tissues do not express NKG 2 D glycoproteins on the cell surface, but these ligands can be induced by hyperproliferation and transformation, as well as when cells are infected by pathogens. Thus, the NKG 2 D pathway serves as a mechanism for the immune system to detect and eliminate cells that have undergone "stress. " Viruses and tumor cells have devised numerous strategies to evade detection by the NKG 2 D surveillance system, and diversification of the NKG 2 D ligand genes likely has been driven by selective pressures imposed by pathogens.

40|$|Our {{understanding}} of cell-cell interactions has been significantly improved {{in the past}} years {{with the help of}} Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence Microscope (TIRFM) in combination with an antigen presenting system supported by planar lipid bilayer (PLB) membranes, which are used to mimic the <b>extensive</b> receptor and <b>ligand</b> interactions within cell-cell contact interface. In TIRFM experiments, it is a challenge to uniformly present ligand molecules in monomeric format on the surface of PLB membranes. Here, we introduce a new and robust method of tethering IgG surrogate antigen ligands on the surface of Ni(2 +) -containing PLB membranes. In this method, we use a modified D domain from staphylococcal protein A molecule that is fused with an N-terminus polyhistidine tag (H 12 -D-domain) to tether IgG surrogate antigens on Ni(2 +) -containing PLB membranes. We systematically assessed the specificity and capability of H 12 -D-domain construct to capture IgG molecules from different species through live cell and single molecule TIRFM imaging. We find that these IgG surrogate antigens tethered by H 12 -D-domain show better lateral mobility and are more uniformly distributed on PLB membranes than the ones tethered by streptavidin. Neither IgM molecules, nor Fab or F(ab') 2 fragments of IgG molecules can be tethered on PLB membranes by H 12 -D-domain construct. These tethered IgG surrogate antigens strongly induce the formation and accumulation of signaling active antigen receptor microclusters within the immunological synapse in B or T lymphocyte cells. Thus our method provides a new and robust method to tether IgG surrogate antigens or other molecules fused with IgG Fc portion on PLB membranes for TIRFM based molecule imaging experiments...|$|R

40|$|In this study, we {{performed}} an extensive {{exploration of the}} ligand entry mechanism {{for members of the}} steroid nuclear hormone receptor family (androgen receptor, estrogen receptor α, glucocorticoid receptor, mineralocorticoid receptor, and progesterone receptor) and their endogenous ligands. The exploration revealed a shared entry path through the helix 3, 7, and 11 regions. Examination of the x-ray structures of the receptor-ligand complexes further showed two distinct folds of the helix 6 – 7 region, classified as “open” and “closed”, which could potentially affect ligand binding. To improve sampling of the helix 6 – 7 loop, we incorporated motion modes based on principal component analysis of existing crystal structures of the receptors and applied them to the protein-ligand sampling. A detailed comparison with the anisotropic network model (an elastic network model) highlights the importance of flexibility in the entrance region. While the binding (interaction) energy of individual simulations can be used to score different <b>ligands,</b> <b>extensive</b> sampling further allows us to predict absolute binding free energies and analyze reaction kinetics using Markov state models and Perron-cluster cluster analysis, respectively. The predicted relative binding free energies for three ligands binding to the progesterone receptor are in very good agreement with experimental results and the Perron-cluster cluster analysis highlighted the importance of a peripheral binding site. Our analysis revealed that the flexibility of the helix 3, 7, and 11 regions represents the most important factor for ligand binding. Furthermore, the hydrophobicity of the ligand influences the transition between the peripheral and the active binding site.

Molecularly resolved STM images reveal that these films form highly ordered 2 -D trigonal arrays, which appear to be composed of one-dimensional polymeric strands with a repeat unit of (tpy-dendrimer-tpy-M) x, {{in the case of}} dendrimers, or (tpy-bridge-tpy-M) x, {{in the case of the}} bridging <b>ligands.</b> An <b>extensive</b> study with <b>ligands</b> of tailored architecture has been carried out, providing insight on the relationship between the ligand’s molecular structure and that of the resulting films. The formation of ordered domains appears to be controlled, at least in part, by the rigidity of the molecule containing the terpyridine groups. Films derived from bridging ligands containing long chains did not give rise to observable periodic structures, whereas, rotationally hindered bridging ligands gave rise to well-ordered films. The use of optically active ligands gave rise to helical structures whose sense was dependent on the chirality of the molecule employed. The physical extension of the ordered domains appears to be delimited by terrace width on the HOPG surface. The dimensions obtained from an analysis of STM images are consistent with the estimated size (from molecular modeling) of the molecules from which the films were derived.

40|$|We {{report the}} first {{application}} of polarized fluorescence depletion (PFD), a technique which combines {{the sensitivity of}} fluorescence detection with the long lifetimes of triplet probes, to the measurement of membrane protein rotational diffusion on individually selected, intact mammalian cells. We have examined the rotation of type I Fc epsilon receptors (Fc epsilon RI) on rat mucosal mast cells of the RBL- 2 H 3 line in their resting monomeric and differently oligomerized states using as probes IgE and three monoclonal antibodies (mAbs; H 10, J 17, and F 4) specific for the Fc epsilon RI. PFD experiments using eosin (EITC) -IgE show that individual Fc epsilon RI on cells have a rotational correlation time (RCT) at 4 degrees C of 79 +/- 4 microseconds. Similarly, Fc epsilon RI-bound EITC-Fab fragments of the J 17 Fc epsilon RI-specific mAb exhibit an RCT of 76 +/- 6 microseconds. These values agree with previous measurements of Fc epsilon RI-bound IgE rotation by time-resolved phosphorescence anisotropy methods. Receptor-bound EITC-conjugated divalent J 17 antibody exhibits an increased RCT of 140 +/- 6 microseconds. This {{is consistent with the}} ability of this mAb to form substantial amounts of Fc epsilon RI dimers on these cell surfaces.
