40|$|Purpose: VUR is {{a common}} urologic problem in children. Cystoscopic {{injection}} of bulking agents (most commonly <b>Deflux)</b> has gained popularity as the first line treatment in the west. However, primarily due to cost factors, it has not gained much popularity in our country. We present our initial experience with cystoscopic <b>Deflux</b> injection for VUR. Materials and Methods: We reviewed our 3 -yr experience {{with the use of}} Dx/HA (<b>Deflux)</b> for correction of VUR in children and adolescents. All children were evaluated with Ultrasound, MCUG and DMSA renal cortical scan. The indications for surgical correction of VUR included breakthrough infections while on antibiotic prophylaxis, persistent high-grade VUR beyond 3 yrs of age, and presence of significant renal damage on DMSA at diagnosis (in those children presenting with UTI). All children underwent cystoscopic <b>Deflux</b> injection using the standard technique of subureteral injection (0. 4 - 1 ml per ureter). All children received antibiotic prophylaxis for 3 - 6 months after the injection. USG was done at 1 month and MCUG at 3 - 6 months after the injection. Results: 33 patients (48 ureters) underwent cystoscopic <b>Deflux</b> injection for correction of VUR. Mean age was 4. 5 yrs (1 - 17 yrs); there were 12 boys and 21 girls. Thirteen children had antenatally diagnosed HDN, while 20 children presented with febrile UTI. All children had primary VUR except one child with persistent VUR 4 yrs after PUV fulguration. The VUR was grade 1 - 2 in 8, grade 3 - 4 in 37, and grade 5 in 3 ureters. Every child had at least one ureter with dilating reflux (grades 3, 4 or 5). When present, low grade VUR (grade 1 or 2) was always on the contralateral side. Only one child received a 2 nd injection after 6 months. Follow-up MCUG was done in 28 children (41 ureters). Complete reflux resolution was achieved in 27 ureters (65 %), and the reflux was downgraded in 2 (5 %). There were no complications of <b>Deflux</b> injection. Conclusions: Endoscopic correction of VUR in children is a safe and effective minimally invasive treatment for VUR. It stops or downgrades VUR in 70 % of ureters. At present, we recommend it as a first-line treatment for grades 1 - 4 VUR requiring surgical management. Cost is the major factor limiting its use in our country...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aim. Vesicouretheral reflux (VUR) is an {{inherited}} abnormality of the urinary tract caused by dysfunction of vesicouretheral junction frequently accompanied by recurrent urinary infection. The optimal treatment method of VUR is still controversial. The {{aim of the}} study was to analyze medical charts of children with VUR with special focus on the results of endoscopic treatment with <b>Deflux.</b> Methods. This retrospective study analyzed the medical charts of all children diagnosed with VUR at the Institute for Children and Youth Health Care of Vojvodina, in five years period. The analyzed data were: age, gender, grade, bilateral or unilateral presence of reflux, distribution to the sides of the body, urinary tract infections, associated anomalies and complications of VUR, treatment methods and the success rate of endoscopic correction with <b>Deflux.</b> Data processing was performed using the standard statistical methods. Results. The study included 167 patients (101 females and 66 males) with 231 refluxing ureters. The patients age at diagnosis was 1 month to 18 years (mean 4. 6 years). Frequencies of different grades of VUR at initial investigation were: 17 %, 27 %, 22 %, 21 % and 13 % for grades I to V, respectively. VUR was unilateral in 103 patients (left in 65 and right in 38), and bilateral in 64. Urinary tract infections were present in 78. 4 % of patients, reflux nephropathy in 38. 3 %, hypertension in 3. 0 %, chronic renal insufficiency in 4. 8 %, associated anomalies in 39. 5 % of patients. The treatment method was recorded in 154 cases. Medically were treated 80 patients, and surgically 74. Endoscopic injection of <b>Deflux</b> was carried out in 59 patients. From 79 ureters treated, five had grade I reflux, 11 grade II, 23 grade III, 27 grade IV, and 13 grade V. In 46 patients <b>Deflux</b> injection was carried out once. A second injection was required in eight, and third injection in five patients. Reflux was absent in 42 of the treated patients (71. 2 %) and 15 patients (25. 4 %) had a decreased grade of reflux after the treatment. Overall success rate was 96. 6 %. Conclusion.

40|$|Purpose: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare cure rates and {{complications}} of polydimethylsiloxane (Macroplastique Ⓡ) and dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer (<b>Deflux</b> Ⓡ) in the treatment of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). Materials and Methods: From April 2001 to March 2008, 29 boys and 42 girls (total of 115 ureters) with a mean age of 6 years who had undergone endoscopic subureteral transurethral injection for VUR were enrolled. A single subureteral injection of Macroplastique was performed in 31 ureters in 23 children (group I; grade II: 4; grade III: 12; grade IV: 9; grade V: 6), and a single subureteral injection of <b>Deflux</b> was performed in 84 ureters in 48 children (group II; grade II: 24; grade III: 14; grade IV: 25; grade V: 21). Renal ultrasound was done 1 day after injection, and voiding cystourethrography (VCUG) was done at 3 months. Successful reflux correction was defined as absent or grade I reflux on follow-up VCUG. Results: No significant difference in success rates was observed between group I and group II [80. 6 % (25 / 31) vs. 78. 6 % (66 / 84), respectively, p> 0. 05]. The following postoperative complications developed: ureteral obstruction in 2 ureters of group I and 3 ureters of group II, asymptomatic urinary tract infection in 3 patients of group I and 2 patients of group II, and bladder calcification by erosion or mucosal necrosis in 2 patients of group I.

40|$|Purpose: In the {{endoscopic}} {{treatment of}} vesicoureteral reflux, {{the relatively high}} rate of success, {{the simplicity of the}} procedure, high patient compliance, and a lack of complications has led to the increased development of injection materials and techniques. We report a method of identifying and maintaining a clear visual field during ureteral and bladder submucosal wall injection of a dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer (<b>Deflux,</b> Oceana, Therapeutics Inc.) by use of the hydrodistention implantation technique (HIT) with the aid of temporary ureteral catheter insertion. Materials and Methods: We prospectively reviewed patients with grade IV or V reflux who received an endoscopic injection of <b>Deflux.</b> Reflux grade was evaluated before and after treatment (3 months) by use of voiding cystourethrograms. Conventional sub-trigonal injection (STING) was performed with injection of <b>Deflux</b> underneath the bladder mucosa at the 6 o’clock position. HIT was performed either with hydrodistention or with guidewire insertion. These techniques increase visualization of the intramural portion of the distal ureteral wall. Patients with treatment failures were offered reinjection up to three times. Results: Sixty-three patients completed endoscopic injection and follow-up of 3 months. The overall resolution rate for conventional STING was 58 %, i. e., 67 % for grade IV and 43 % for grade V. The overall resolution rate for HIT was 80 %, i. e., 93 % for grade IV and 66 % for grade V. The modified methods showed higher resolution rates for overall cure owing to the success in patients with grade IV reflux (p= 0. 026). Although the success of grade V treatment was higher with the modified method, the success rate was not statistically significant (p= 0. 27).

40|$|Introduction: In the past, urological {{complications}} after renal transplantation {{were associated}} with significant morbidity. With the development and application of endourological procedures, {{it is now possible}} to manage these cases with minimally invasive techniques. Materials and Methods: A MEDLINE search for articles published in English using key words for the management of urological complications after renal transplantation was undertaken. Forty articles were selected and reviewed. Results: The incidence of urological complications postrenal transplantation was reported to be 2 – 13 %. Ureteric leaks occurred in up to 8. 6 %, and 55 % were managed endourologically. The incidence of lymphocele was as high as 20 %, and less that 12 % of the cases required treatment. Ureteric stricture was the most common complication, and endourological management was successful in 50 – 70 %. The occurrence of complicated vesicoureteral reflux was 4. 5 %, and 90 % of low-grade reflux cases were successfully treated with <b>deflux</b> injections. Stones and obstructive voiding dysfunction occurred in about 1 % of kidney transplant recipients. Conclusion: Minimally invasive techniques have a critical role in the management of urological complications after renal transplantation. Urinary leakage should be managed with complete decompression. Percutaneous drainage should be the first line of treatment for lymphocele that is symptomatic or causing ureteric obstruction. Laparoscopic lymphocele deroofing is successful in aspiration-resistant cases. <b>Deflux</b> is highly successful for the management of complicated low-grade kidney transplant reflux.

40|$|Introduction. Vescicoureteral reflux (VUR) is {{a dynamic}} event {{in which there is}} a {{retrograde}} passage of urine from the bladder to the ureters. It is the most common urological disease in the childhood and it manifests with recurrent urinary tract infections (UTI). The therapeutic strategy provides an antibiotic prophylaxis, invasive surgery (Cohen reimplantation) and minimally invasive surgery (endoscopic subureteral injection). Recently, Endoscopic Subureteral Injection with <b>Deflux</b> became the treat- ment of choice. The purpose of this work was to conduce a retrospective study of our patients with VUR to evaluate the role of endoscopic technique (<b>Deflux</b> and Macroplastique) in the treatment. Materials and Methods. Forty two patients with VUR were treated by us in 65 refluxing units. Twenty were males (47. 6 %) and 22 (52. 4 %) females. Sex, age of infiltration, presence of associated diseases, unilaterality and bilaterality, side of pres- entation of VUR and substance used for injection were considered. The follow-up study included urine cultures and periodic renal ultrasound. The mintional cistouretrography was performed after 12 months. The results were statistically evaluated with the "Wilcoxson test”, comparing data of patients treated with <b>Deflux</b> and Macroplastique. results. Refluxing ureters underwent endoscopic treatment by submeatal injection were 65, 4. 6 % with VUR grade I, 12. 3 % grade II, 43 % grade III, 29. 23 % grade IV and 10. 87 % gradeV. In 19 patients, amounting to 45. 2 %, this was a unilateral VUR (84. 2 % left, 15. 78 % right) and in 23 patients, equal to 54. 76 %, a bilateral VUR. Thirdy eight per cent of these patients had associated diseases. At the first follow-up, the cure rate was 81. 53 %. At the second follow-up, the cure rate, including the 9 children re-infiltrated, was 89. 23 %. Four patients underwent a further infiltration, so as at the third follow-up, the overall cure rate was 93. 84 %. In only one patient with bilateral VUR grade IV, it was necessary to perform Cohen ureteral reimplan- tation due to the persistence of VUR after 2 endoscopic infiltration. In another one, due to the clinical severity and the per- sisting of VUR after two endoscopic infiltration, we decided to plan the bilateral reimplant according to Cohen. We have not been demonstrated significant differences based on gender, age of infiltration and the substance used, were not observed. Conclusions. At the moment, ours patients have a regular weight-height growth and they don’t have urinary tract infection or vescicoureteral reflux. The sub-meatal infiltration is a simple, repeatable and reliable techinique whereby results are imme- diate and safe in most cases. For this reason, we conclude that the submeatal infiltration represents the first-line treatment in patients with vescicoureteral reflux...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: We report our {{experience}} with subureteral submucosal injection therapy for vesicoureteral reflux {{and determine the}} safety and efficacy in patients treated with dextranomer/ hyaluronic acid co-polymer. Background: Vesicoureteral reflux affects 1 % of children and increases the chances of urinary tract infection, pyelonephritis, hypertension and chronic renal insufficiency. The aim of identifying and treating vesicoureteral reflux in children is to prevent occurrence of long term complications. Method: A total of sixty three patients aged between 1 - 21 years with grade III – V vesicoureteral reflux, who had failed on conservative treatment were considered for this study during February 2004 to May 2012. Vesicoureteral reflux was diagnosed by voiding cysto-urethrogram (VCUG). They underwent subureteral injection of dextranomer/ hyaluronic acid co-polymer. Results: Among the sixty three patients treated, 51 (81 %) were cured with single injection while a second injection raised the cure rate to 60 (95 %). Conclusion: The minimally invasive treatment of vesicoureteral reflux with <b>deflux</b> (dextranomer/ hyaluronic acid co-polymer) is an effective alternative procedure to open surgical technique requiring minimal operating time with low morbidity...|$|R

Endoscopic treatment for vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) has become an established alternative to long-term antibiotic prophylaxis and ureteral reimplantation. We present the outcome of endoscopic treatment with dextranomer/hyaluronic acid copolymer (<b>Deflux)</b> for VUR in children by a single surgeon at our institute from October 2003 to October 2009. We reviewed the cases of 150 patients (total 239 ureters), 56 girls (37 %) and 94 boys (63 %), {{with a mean age}} of 2. 2 years and a median followup of 2. 5 years (range 3 – 68 months). Among the 239 ureters treated, 67. 4 % (161 / 239) were cured with a single injection, and a second and third injection raised the cure rate to 86. 6 % (207 / 239) and 88. 3 % (211 / 239), respectively.

40|$|Introduction. Crossed renal ectopia with fusion is a {{very rare}} {{congenital}} anomaly and the reported incidence varies between 1 : 1000 and 1 : 7000. The kidney {{is located on the}} opposite site of the mid- line from where the ureter enters the bladder. Eighty-five percent of crossed renal ectopia kid- neys are fused from below to the normally located kidney. This anomaly is more frequent for left kidney and it’s associated with vesico-ureteral re- flux (VUR) in 25 - 70 % of cases. We report the management of a six-years-old patient with Pluri- malformative Syndrome, trisomy p 16 and mono- somy q 2, crossed renal ectopia with fusion type A and bilateral vesico-ureteral reflux (grade IV in the right kidney and grade III in the left). Materials and Methods. A 6 -year-old boy was ammitted to our hospital for UTI in plurimalfor- mative syndrome characterized at birth by cleft palate, macrocephaly, congenital clubfeet, twisted right arm, congenital dysplasia of the hip, balanic hypospadias, bilateral inguinal hernia, right renal agenesis and epilepsy tonic-clonic. MRI revealed a fusion of the ectopic kidney with the left ortho- topic kidney (crossed renal ectopia with fusion type A). Voiding cystography showed a dilatated ureter of the crossed ectopic kidney passing across the midline and of the left ureter, and a bilateral vesico-ureteral reflux (grade IV VUR in the right kidney and grade III VUR in the left). For this reason bilaterally endoscopic subureteral infiltra- tion was performed with <b>Deflux</b> (0. 3 cc for side). Results. Patient was discharged in third day and he took antibiotic for one week. There weren’t complications like fever, obstruction or UTI. Fol- low-up after 1 month is normal and there weren’t UTI. Conclusion. Generally the outcome of patients with fused crossed renal ectopia is good. Presence of associated pathology likeVUR, could lead to a progressive deterioration of renal function. There- fore, in patient with uninhabited kidney area and UTI, it’s very important a carefull radiological in- vestigation to exclude a renal ectopy complicated by RVU and especially to realize an appropriate treatment strategy before the patient develops a chronic renal failure. Endoscopic infiltration with <b>Deflux,</b> in our case, was detected a viable surgical technique for its minimally invasiveness and also for its efficacy with a relatively short hospital stay...|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decades the surgery for total {{continent}} reconstruction has been changed {{by the introduction of}} intermittent catheterized stoma with the purpose to preserve urinary tract function, urinary continence, elimination of fecal soiling, preservation of quality of life with complete self-sufficiency. We report a rare case of complete incontinence in caudal regression syndrome in whom the appendix was long enough to be divided for creation of both channels for the treatment of urinary and fecal incontinence. A 9 -year-old male patient with complete incontinence in caudal regression syndrome was submitted to a Mitrofanoff appendicovesicostomy procedure (AV) in conjunction with appendicocecostomy procedure (ACE). The appendix was divided into two different parts preserving adequate perfusion. Fecal continence was achieved for a period of 18 - 20 hours after a colonic irrigation with 500 ml of saline solution one time daily, while urinary continence was obtained after suburethral endoscopic injection of dextranomer/hyaluronic acid (<b>Deflux)</b> and intermittent catheterization every 3 hours with an evident reduction of upper urinary tract dilatation.

40|$|Aim of the Study: Subureteral {{endoscopic}} {{injection of}} a bulking agent {{is an attractive}} alternative to open surgery or antibiotic prophylaxis for vesico ureteral reflux (VUR). Little information is available about long-term risk of recurrence after an initially successful treatment. Aim {{of this paper was}} to review short- and long-term success rate of endoscopic treatment in a single Center series after risk stratification of individual patients. Materials and Methods: The records of 126 patients who underwent <b>Deflux</b> injection for primary VUR were examined. Indications to treatment were an unvaried high grade VUR (IV-V) at 1 year from diagnosis and/or and recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI) on antibiotic prophylaxis even in the presence of mild grade VUR (III grade). Gender, age and mode of diagnosis, infections (UTI), voiding dysfunctions, VUR grade and side, renal function, number of treatments were correlated to outcome. Long-term evaluation was planned at a minimum of 1 year from the last negative post-injection cystogram (MCUG). A new MCUG and DMSA scan were also offered to those complaining new UTI episodes. Late recurrences were correlated to history and grade of reflux. Data were analyzed with Graph Pad Instat software; the Chi-square test was used for univariate comparisons, the Fisher′s exact test for categorical variables. and multiple regression tests for factors influencing outcome. Results: M/F ratio was 62 to 64; median age at diagnosis was 28 months. VUR affected 198 renal units. Preinjection VUR grade was I in 1, II in 27, III in 107, IV in 59, and V in 4 units. Reduced DMSA uptake was evidenced in 51 units and scarring in 24. Median age at treatment was 34. 5 months, for persistent high grade VUR (IV-V) in 55 patients and recurrent IVU in 92. Two hundred sixty seven injections were performed on 198 ureters. Complete resolution was documented by MCUG at 3 - 5 months in 68 %, low grading < II in 20 %, persistence or unsignificant reduction in 11 %. Preoperative recurrent UTI, higher grade VUR, and bilaterality were correlated to a poorer surgical outcome. Among 80 successfully treated cases, 12 complained of persistent UTI. Recurrence of VUR was demonstrated in 31 % of them. Deteriorated uptake or additional scarring in 25 % was independent from VUR recurrence. Preoperative recurrent UTI and voiding dysfunction correlated significantly to late outcome. Conclusions: Preoperative recurrent IVU, together with high-grade reflux, seem to correlate to lower success rate of <b>Deflux</b> injection for primary VUR. Even after successful endoscopic treatment, long-term surveillance may be needed among these cases, mainly if voiding dysfunction is also recorded. Late recurring VUR must be actively excluded in case of new IVU episodes...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. Complications {{following}} renal transplantation include ureteral obstruction, urinary leak and fistula, urinary retention, urolithiasis, and vesicoureteral reflux. These complications {{have traditionally}} been managed with open surgical correction, but minimally invasive techniques are being utilized frequently. Materials and Methods. A literature review {{was performed on the}} use of endourologic techniques for the management of urologic transplant complications. Results. Ureterovesical anastomotic stricture is the most common long-term urologic complication following renal transplantation. Direct vision endoureterotomy is successful in up to 79 % of cases. Urinary leak is the most frequent renal transplant complication early in the postoperative period. Up to 62 % of patients have been successfully treated with maximal decompression (nephrostomy tube, ureteral stent, and Foley catheter). Excellent outcomes have been reported following transurethral resection of the prostate shortly after transplantation for patients with urinary retention. Vesicoureteral reflux after renal transplant is common. 				<b>Deflux</b> injection has been shown to resolve reflux in up to 90 % of patients with low-grade disease in the absence of high pressure voiding. Donor-gifted and de novo transplant calculi may be managed with shock wave, ureteroscopic, or percutaneous lithotripsy. Conclusions. Recent advances in equipment and technique have allowed many transplant patients with complications to be effectively managed endoscopically...|$|R
40|$|Background: Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR) {{is a major}} urological {{problem in}} children. Its {{incidence}} ranges from 1 to 3 % in healthy children. Materials and Methods: We treated 38 children and analysed their data on age, sex, reflux grade, laterality, and results of endoscopic treatment (ET), at the different grades of reflux. All children were operated on an Ambulatory Surgery basis, studying the complications and post-operative course. Results: Thirty-eight patients were operated {{during a period of}} six years, of age between one and twelve years. VUR was bilateral in 24 (63 %) patients, unilateral in 14 (34 %), with a collection of a total of 62 renal units or ureters. In 29 children (76 %), 46 refluxing ureters (70 %) completely disappeared after just 1 ET. Nine patients (24 %) with 16 ureteral units (30 %) received a second ET, with the reflux disappearing successfully in seven children (12 ureteral units), changing the success rate in the disappearance of VUR, after two injections of <b>Deflux,</b> to 90 % of the total group of ureters (58 of 62). Conclusion: The endoscopic treatment of VUR has become the first choice of treatment to control the primary reflux, {{not just because of the}} good results, but because of the low post-operative morbidity and the direct relationship with the Ambulatory Surgery Unit...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} {{our experience}} and results {{of using the}} MicroPerc™ micropercutaneous nephrolithotomy armamentarium (PolyDiagnost, Germany) for unusual indications unexplored using this modality. Patients and methods: We used the MicroPerc™ system for stone clearance in three ureteric calculi, two bladder calculi, one case of urethral calculus, for antegrade biopsy {{in a case of}} upper tract urothelial carcinoma, for Deflux® (dextranomer/hyaluronic copolymer, Salix Pharmaceuticals, Uppsala, Sweden) injection in three cases of vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR), and three cases of posterior urethral valve (PUV) fulgurations. A 4. 85 -F ‘All-Seeing Needle®’ (PolyDiagnost) was used in most of the cases. An 8 -F mini-micro sheath was used where stability was deemed necessary. Clinical data were collected in a dedicated database. Intraoperative variables, postoperative complications, and outcomes were assessed. Results: All patients were successfully treated with complete stone clearance at 1  month with no residual fragments. The antegrade biopsy confirmed a high-grade papillary neoplasm. There were no technical difficulties with injection of <b>Deflux</b> or PUV fulgurations. Follow-up at 1  year revealed no stone recurrence, resolved reflux in all three cases, and all the children that had had PUVs were voiding well. The small sample and retrospective nature of the analysis are the limitations of this study. Conclusion: MicroPerc™, besides its usual use for minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy, can also be feasibly used for ureteric, bladder and urethral stones, and for treating non-calculus diseases such as PUVs and VUR. True to its name, it may be an ‘All-Seeing Needle’ in reality with much more to offer and harvest from...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction and Objective: Multiple options {{exist for}} the {{surgical}} management of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). We report on our 10 -year experience using the inguinal approach to extravesical ureteral reimplantation (EVR). Materials and Methods: Patient characteristics of age, gender, and reflux grade were obtained and outcomes of operative time, hospital stay, and radiographic resolution were assessed. Results: 71 girls and 20 boys {{with a mean age}} of 74 months (range 14 - 164) underwent inguinal EVR via a 3. 5 -cm inguinal mini-incision. Mean follow up was 10. 9 months (range 0. 4 - 69. 7). Average grade of reflux was 2. 80. Average operative time was 91 minutes (range 51 - 268). The procedure was successful in 87 of 91 patients (95. 6 %). The 3 cases of reflux that persisted were all grade 1 and managed expectantly. Contralateral reflux developed in 9 cases, all of which resolved after treatment with either <b>Deflux</b> or ureteral reimplant. There were 4 case of urinary retention that resolved after a brief period of CIC or indwelling catheterization. There were no cases of ureteral obstruction. Most patients were discharged on post-operative day 1 (85 / 91) and no hospitalization extended beyond 3 days. Conclusions: The inguinal approach to extravesical ureteral reimplantation should be considered as a potentially minimally invasive alternative to endoscopic and robotic treatment of VUR with a success rate more comparable to traditional open approaches. We feel it is the method of choice in cases of unilateral VUR requiring surgical correction...|$|R

A fundamental undemanding of the chemical natu ~ of process specific contamination is essential to enable thegroper selection of appropriate alternative cleaning agents. In this study, the role and need of CFCs used in hybrid assembly cleaning prior to hermetic encapsulation was studied. The specific case of mishandling contamination removal (i. e., fingerprints) was addressed. Due to the unpredictable nature {{of this type of}} contamination, a method of applying "standard" contamination to simulate accidental handling contamination was d The contamination added contained both a non-polar organic component (fat) and a (salt). m groups of commercially available non-halogenated solvents, alcohols, terpene based and ester based, were evaluated for <b>defluxing</b> and general surface cleaning in various hybrid assembly cleaning operations. The abiity of these solvents to remove polar (ionic) and non-polar (organic) contaminants was analyzed and compared to that of the CFCs. Surface cleanliness was monitoTed using surface analytical techniques such as X-Ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy. The results indicate that some cleanem are able to surpass the cleaning efficiency of the CFCs, especially for removing polar species. All of the solvents studied performed well. Judicious and practical choice of alternative solvent, therefore, depends on the specific application. Although this study has targeted hybrid cleaning specifically, the results can be extended to other cleaning applications involving organic contamination removal, e. g., fingerprints. The cleaning materials evaluated here can potentially serve as replacements for the chlomflo"s, pending specific process evaluations. -...|$|R
