25|$|Game 6 on Oct 27, {{averaged}} 21.1 {{million viewers}} with a 12.7 {{rating and a}} 21 share. Through six games, the 2011 World Series on FOX <b>is</b> <b>averaging</b> a 9.3/15 in household rating/share, with 15.3 million viewers, +11% in rating over last year (8.4/14, 14.3 million) and 2008 (8.4/14, 13.6 million). Both were five game series. The current 9.3/15 average for the 2011 World Series would rank as the sixth highest-rated show (live+same day) in primetime, a ranking that was likely to improve with {{the inclusion of a}} rare Game 7. Game 6 opened with an 8.5 at 8:00 PM EDT and grew steadily throughout the night averaging 11.7 from 9:00–9:30 PM EDT; 12.9 from 10:00–10:30 PM EDT; and 13.2 from 11:00–11–30 PM EDT. The broadcast peaked with a 15.0 HH rating and 25.2 million viewers from midnight-12:30 AM EDT.|$|E
25|$|However, {{for a large}} {{data set}} (over 100 points) from a {{symmetric}} population, the mean can be estimated reasonably efficiently relative to the best estimate by L-estimators. Using a single point, this is done by taking the median of the sample, with no calculations required (other than sorting); this yields an efficiency of 64% or better (for all n). Using two points, a simple estimate is the midhinge (the 25% trimmed mid-range), but a more efficient estimate is the 29% trimmed mid-range, that <b>is,</b> <b>averaging</b> the two values 29% {{of the way in}} from the smallest and the largest values: the 29th and 71st percentiles; this has an efficiency of about 81%. For three points, the trimean (average of median and midhinge) can be used, though the average of the 20th, 50th, and 80th percentile yields 88% efficiency. Using further points yield higher efficiency, though it is notable that only 3 points are needed for very high efficiency.|$|E

Unlike in Holochilus brasiliensis, which occurs in the same area, the tail is longer than the head and body. It is sparsely haired and dark, and there is no difference in color between the upper and lower side. The coat, which is long, dense, and soft, is yellow–brown at the sides, but becomes darker on the upperparts and lighter on the underparts. The large hindfeet are characterized by conspicuous interdigital webbing, but they lack tufts of hair on the digits and several of the pads are reduced. As in some other semiaquatic oryzomyines, fringes of hair are present along the plantar margins and between some of the digits. The forefeet also lack tufts on the digits and show very long claws, a character unique among oryzomyines.

The season one finale aired August 5, 2007, and received the lowest rating of the year – 1.051million and only in the 13th slot of the night. This was predominantly because it aired {{in the same time}}-slot as the season premiere of rival program Australian Idol.

The show was [...] "shelved" [...] after the ninth episode was shown on July 2, and will resume airing the remaining episodes until after the Olympics. It was replaced by [...] "RSPCA Animal Rescue". Ugly Betty returned to Seven on August 28, 2008, at a new and later timeslot of 9:30 pm Thursdays. The episode aired, [...] "Bananas For Betty" [...] was viewed by only 597,000 viewers and was removed. Seven later announced that Ugly Betty will return twice a week, every Tuesday and Thursday at 7:30 pm, starting when Summer begins. It was then moved to only once a week at Thursday 7:30 pm. Soon after, the show was pulled from screening (after finishing the second season) due to moderately low ratings. It was later confirmed on October 23, 2009, that Ugly Betty would return to Australian screens on Seven's new secondary digital channel 7Two. It will resume with the premiere of Season 3, [...] "The Manhattan Project", starting Tuesday, November 3, 7:30 pm. It will air right through summer, with Season 3 to then finish in April/May 2010.
