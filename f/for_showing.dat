5|$|There {{were two}} reasons <b>for</b> <b>showing</b> Oscar's head and {{shoulders}} within the frame during the flashback scenes, rather than letting the camera be the character's eyes. The first was {{that this is the}} way Noé usually sees himself in dreams and when recalling past events. He also thought it would be easier for the viewer to care about a character who is visible, as many point-of-view films, in his opinion, look unintentionally funny.|$|E
5|$|Two {{versions}} of the film were released to DVD, the original broadcast version and an extended directors cut.

The husband-and-wife team of Gerty Cori and Carl Ferdinand Cori shared the 1947 Prize in Physiology or Medicine as did the husband-and-wife team of May-Britt Moser and Edvard Moser in 2014 (along with John O'Keefe). J. J. Thomson was awarded the Physics Prize in 1906 <b>for</b> <b>showing</b> that {{electrons}} are particles. His son, George Paget Thomson, received the same prize in 1937 <b>for</b> <b>showing</b> that they also have the properties of waves. William Henry Bragg and his son, William Lawrence Bragg, shared the Physics Prize in 1915 for inventing the X-ray spectrometer. Niels Bohr was awarded the Physics prize in 1922, as did his son, Aage Bohr, in 1975. Manne Siegbahn, who received the Physics Prize in 1924, was the father of Kai Siegbahn, who received the Physics Prize in 1981.

5|$|Dopamine {{was first}} {{synthesized}} in 1910 by George Barger and James Ewens at Wellcome Laboratories in London, England and first {{identified in the}} human brain by Kathleen Montagu in 1957. It was named dopamine {{because it is a}} monoamine whose precursor in the Barger-Ewens synthesis is 3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (levodopa or L-DOPA). Dopamine's function as a neurotransmitter was first recognized in 1958 by Arvid Carlsson and Nils-Åke Hillarp at the Laboratory for Chemical Pharmacology of the National Heart Institute of Sweden. Carlsson was awarded the 2000 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine <b>for</b> <b>showing</b> that dopamine is not only a precursor of norepinephrine (noradrenaline) and epinephrine (adrenaline), but is also itself a neurotransmitter.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of the album, Stone Sour went on to promote it for almost a year; {{releasing}} three singles and touring in several regions, including the United States and several countries in Europe.

5|$|Kotarou becomes {{disillusioned with}} Guardian's tactics {{and returns to}} Kazamatsuri where he meets Kagari again. She tells him she must {{initiate}} re-evolution, but since this {{would lead to a}} dead world, Kagari must find good memories brought out through the betterment of life on Earth, as opposed to bad memories caused by war and conflict. Kotarou agrees to help her and he acts as a double agent, demolishing Gaia's and Guardian's infrastructure in Kazamatsuri and killing those on either side. Kazamatsuri is partly destroyed when Gaia attempts to force Kagari to initiate re-evolution, but Kotarou manages to stop this from occurring. As a result, Kagari praises Kotarou and shows gratitude <b>for</b> <b>showing</b> her satisfactory memories. Kotarou unwillingly stabs Kagari, and after a kiss, they evolve into an orb of light inside a tree.|$|E

5|$|Lumumba's speech, {{broadcast}} {{live on the}} radio across the world, denounced colonialism and was interpreted as an affront to Belgium and Baudouin personally. While it was well-received within the Congo, it was widely condemned internationally as unnecessarily confrontational and <b>for</b> <b>showing</b> ingratitude {{at a time when}} Belgium had granted independence to the state. The speech nearly provoked a diplomatic incident between the Congo and Belgium and Lumumba later gave further speeches attempting to adopt a more conciliatory tone.|$|E
5|$|Money Can't Buy was a one-off concert show held on 15 November 2003 at {{entertainment}} venue Carling Apollo, London, {{to promote}} Australian recording artist Kylie Minogue's ninth studio album Body Language. It was entitled so as no tickets were {{offered for sale}} publicly and only invited guests and competition winners attended the show. William Baker and Alan MacDonald served as creative and art directors, respectively, while Michael Rooney and Steve Anderson worked on the choreography and musical arrangements. Display hardware manufacturer Barco provided LED displays <b>for</b> <b>showing</b> graphics as backdrops to the performances. Minogue wore five different costumes, designed by fashion houses such as Balenciaga, Chanel, and Helmut Lang, for the 75 minutes-long show. The total cost of staging the concert was £1 million.|$|E
5|$|Rarely {{will you}} find Floyd dishing up catchy hooks, tunes short enough for air-play, or {{predictable}} three-chord blues progressions; {{and never will}} you find them spending much time on the usual pop album of romance, partying, or self-hype.

Where most other bands neatly fit the songs to the music, the two forming a sort of autonomous and seamless whole complete with memorable hooks, Pink Floyd tends to set lyrics within a broader soundscape that often {{seems to have a}} life of its own...

5|$|The NFL's {{struggle}} against the AAFC generated stress on wages, attendance, marketing, and by 1949, it had prevented the NFL <b>for</b> <b>showing</b> a profit for three consecutive years. Bell and representatives from both leagues met to attempt a merger, but their efforts were fruitless. In an unrelated matter, he apprised the owners that attendance records had shown televising games locally had {{a negative impact on}} the sale of home tickets. Nevertheless, he actualized the NFL's first television contract—the 1949 championship game. Simultaneously, he dealt with a lawsuit from Bill Radovich, who had been blacklisted for leaving the Lions and gaining employment with the AAFC. Bell and the owners were advised by John C. Jr. that this lawsuit was potentially not winnable, and the ramifications from the outcome of the case weighed heavily on Bell.|$|E

Contemptuously, Naritsugu announces that both {{the people and the}} samurai have only one purpose and that is to serve their lords. Shinzaemon counters by telling Naritsugu that lords cannot live without the support of the people and that, if a lord abuses his power, the people will always rise against him. Naritsugu and Shinzaemon mortally wound each other. As the lord crawls away in mud crying and experiencing fear and pain for the first time, he thanks Shinzaemon <b>for</b> <b>showing</b> him excitement before Shinzaemon chops his head off.|$|E
