5|$|Always a loner, {{he spent}} hours playing with toy trains, preferring {{to cross the}} street rather than speak to anyone. He {{attended}} Whitehall Infant School, then Whitehall Junior School, feeling nervous and shy to the point of feeling faint during morning assembly and having to leave before <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> <b>out.</b> The family doctor suggested a referral to a child psychologist, but his father would have none of it.|$|E

He spent five years with his regiment before attending the Staff College, Camberley in 1889–90; after leaving Camberley, he was promoted to captain in December 1891. From 1896 to 1901 he served on the staff as the deputy assistant adjutant-general at Quetta, in India, with a promotion to major in December 1898.

5|$|After the 1976 tour, Townshend took {{most of the}} {{following}} year off {{to spend time with}} his family. He discovered that former Beatles and Rolling Stones manager Allen Klein had bought a stake in his publishing company. A settlement was reached, but Townshend was upset and disillusioned that Klein had attempted to take ownership of his songs. Townshend went to the Speakeasy where he met the Sex Pistols' Steve Jones and Paul Cook, fans of the Who. After leaving, <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> <b>out</b> in a doorway, where a policeman said he would not be arrested if he could stand and walk. The events inspired the title track of the next album, Who Are You.|$|E
5|$|Assigned to the infantry, during basic {{training}} at Camp Wolters, Texas, Murphy earned the Marksman Badge with Rifle Clasp and the Expert Badge with Bayonet Clasp. While {{participating in a}} close-order drill during that hot Texas summer, <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> <b>out.</b> His company commander thought his build was too slight for service in the infantry, and tried to have him transferred to a cook and bakers' school, but Murphy insisted on becoming a combat soldier. He completed the 13-week {{basic training}} course and in October was given leave to visit his family, after which {{he was sent to}} Fort George G. Meade in Maryland for advanced infantry training until January 1943.|$|E
5|$|In September 1941 Smith {{formally}} {{enlisted in}} the Royal Air Force. He began his instruction with Initial Training Wing in Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia's second city, and after six weeks there transferred to Elementary Flying Training School at Guinea Fowl, just outside Gwelo. The majority of the men he trained alongside were Australians, and many others were British. Smith was glad to find himself in a course that would ultimately lead to flying fighters as opposed to bombers—at Guinea Fowl, he learned to pilot Tiger Moths, then Harvards—and was also pleased to have been posted only a half-hour car journey from Selukwe. Late in the course he was picked out to undergo instruction as an officer cadet, which meant he was transferred to Thornhill, another Gwelo airbase. <b>He</b> <b>passed</b> <b>out</b> in September 1942 with the rank of pilot officer; his training in Southern Rhodesia had taken a year in all.|$|E
50|$|Jezebel {{tries to}} {{convince}} Batman {{that he is}} simply living a life he has fabricated in his own head as a child {{to cope with the}} death of his parents. This suggestion begins to affect Batman's already strained psyche (he almost died and was forced to re-live very traumatic moments in his life as Batman just weeks earlier) and <b>he</b> <b>passes</b> <b>out</b> when Jezebel says aloud a word that was on all the Bat-computer's screens: Zur-En-Arrh. As <b>he</b> <b>passes</b> <b>out,</b> Dr. Hurt and minions of his diabolical club, the Black Glove, infiltrate the Batcave. They drug Batman, beat Alfred, and wreak havoc upon the cave.|$|R

5|$|In the north, 1 RAR was {{inserted}} into its new landing zone—LZ March— to the south-west. With B Company securing the site, the battalion moved on {{foot to the}} line of departure but not before they were mistakenly engaged by US helicopter gunships and artillery fire. However, after the Australians established communications, the shelling was halted and they began their advance. No sooner had the lead elements—D Company under the command of Major Ian Fisher—emerged into the cleared area that was originally to have been used as the battalion's LZ, when the forward platoon came under fire from Viet Cong positions in the tree-line on the north-east corner. In the action which followed, six Australians from 12 Platoon were wounded, including platoon commander Lieutenant Jim Bourke, who was shot through the jaw but remained in command until <b>he</b> <b>passed</b> <b>out</b> from loss of blood. Meanwhile, two medics who attempted to move forward to treat the casualties were themselves shot and killed.|$|E
5|$|The lack of patrolling by MacGregor's troops {{allowed the}} Spanish to march {{straight}} into Porto Bello early on 30 April 1819. MacGregor {{was still in}} bed when the Spaniards found his riflemen drilling in the main square and opened fire. Awoken by the noise, MacGregor threw his bed and blankets from the window onto the beach below and jumped out after them, then attempted to paddle out to his ships on a log. <b>He</b> <b>passed</b> <b>out</b> and would probably have drowned {{had he not been}} picked up and brought aboard the Hero by one of his naval officers. MacGregor would claim that on regaining consciousness he immediately raised his standard over the Hero, then despatched runners to Rafter ordering him not to surrender. The version of events favoured by Sinclair is that Rafter received orders to this effect only after he had himself contacted MacGregor on the Hero. Rafter, in the fort with 200 men, kept up a steady barrage and waited for his commander to fire on the royalists from the ships—but to the colonel's astonishment MacGregor instead ordered his fleet to turn about and made for the high seas. Abandoned, Colonel Rafter and the remnants of MacGregor's army {{had no choice but to}} surrender; most of the surviving officers and troops entered miserable existences in captivity. Rafter was ultimately shot with 11 other officers for conspiring to escape.|$|E
5|$|When {{the news}} of Bohr's escape reached Britain, Lord Cherwell sent a {{telegram}} to Bohr asking {{him to come to}} Britain. Bohr arrived in Scotland on 6 October in a de Havilland Mosquito operated by the British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC). The Mosquitos were unarmed high-speed bomber aircraft that had been converted to carry small, valuable cargoes or important passengers. By flying at high speed and high altitude, they could cross German-occupied Norway, and yet avoid German fighters. Bohr, equipped with parachute, flying suit and oxygen mask, spent the three-hour flight lying on a mattress in the aircraft's bomb bay. During the flight, Bohr did not wear his flying helmet as it was too small, and consequently did not hear the pilot's intercom instruction to turn on his oxygen supply when the aircraft climbed to high altitude to overfly Norway. <b>He</b> <b>passed</b> <b>out</b> from oxygen starvation and only revived when the aircraft descended to lower altitude over the North Sea. Bohr's son Aage followed his father to Britain on another flight a week later, and became his personal assistant.|$|E
