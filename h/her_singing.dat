50|$|Hekja {{hates the}} Norse {{and will not}} share her {{beautiful}} gift of singing with them, {{even if it does}} mean that she would not have to mind the cows as a thrall, if they were to hear <b>her</b> <b>sing.</b> She had told one of the Norsemen, Snorri, when he heard <b>her</b> <b>sing</b> that she did not want anybody to know that she can sing because everything has been taken away from her and that if they heard <b>her</b> <b>sing</b> they would take that away from her too. Hekja's spirit and sheer determination means that she soon finds herself joining her mistress Freydis' expedition to Vinland. Hekja befriends Freydis' brother's thrall, Hikki, and he is the only one she will sing to. They develop a firm friendship.|$|R
5|$|Following {{the release}} of her debut studio album, Breaking Night (1989), La India went on to produce When the Night is Over (1991), a {{collaboration}} between her then-husband Little Louie Vega and Marc Anthony.

India and Vega left Atlantic Records, as India wanted to pursue <b>her</b> <b>singing</b> career performing in Spanish. Three years later, American musician Eddie Palmieri, who had heard <b>her</b> <b>singing</b> on the radio, wrote and produced India's first Spanish-language record titled Llegó la India, via Eddie Palmieri (1992).

In 1995, the album was re-released as a CD {{during a period of}} customer interest in 1950s exotica. Its artistry was re-examined in light of Angelou's later fame; it was said to exemplify the calypso music of the period, spiced with a feeling for the tradition's roots.|$|E
5|$|Kurosaki {{originally}} {{became interested}} in becoming a performer during her elementary years.

The Jacksons {{as well as an}} early love of musicals—motivated her to become a {{professional}} recording artist, and the show's producer encouraged her to sing. Jackson served as a backing vocalist for several musicians around this time, as well as a cabaret singer. She contributed her voice for songs by artists such as The Emotions, Sonny Bono, and Betty Wright before Jackson's second pregnancy stalled her musical career for a short time.|$|E

She dressed and acted modestly, only wearing jewelry for occasions of state, and gave the impression of being somewhat sad. She had no interest in politics and occupied her time writing letters, reading, doing needlework, and attending to religious obligations and charitable projects. She possessed a beautiful voice, and often practiced <b>her</b> <b>singing</b> skills. Her appreciation for music also meant that she enjoyed opera and balls.|$|E
