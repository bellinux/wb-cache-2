Narrow timber steps lead up to the stage at {{both sides of the}} hall. Behind the stage are three rooms; a kitchen and two toilets. The wall dividing the stage area from the rear rooms is a single skinned timber lined wall with exposed cross bracing partially exposed in the kitchen area only. The toilet areas have been created by the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>partition</b> walls lined with fibrous cement sheeting. Ceramic tiling has been used to cover the timber floors in the toilet areas. Fretted fanlights above the toilet and kitchen doors are recent installations.|$|R
5|$|The Mostyns' {{principal}} residence was Mostyn Hall in Flintshire and so {{the family}} rented out Plas Mawr to various tenants during the 18th and 19th centuries. In the 18th century the gatehouse {{was used as a}} courthouse and the main house as cheap housing. In the 19th century, parts of the house were converted into a school and space for other small businesses, as well as still being used for domestic accommodation: in 1881, the house had 25 residents. Minor changes were made to Plas Mawr in the process, such as the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> <b>partition</b> walls to subdivide the larger rooms, but it remained largely intact. The Mostyns offered the house for sale in 1870, as part of a package of land including Bodysgallen Hall, but there were no offers.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} a CFD analysis on thermal comfort and energy consumption effected by partitions in an air-conditioned building. CFD experiments {{are carried out}} to simulate variables of indoor air before/after <b>installation</b> or removal <b>of</b> <b>partitions.</b> Accordingly, the Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) is determined {{as an indicator of}} thermal comfort while the cooling load of make-up air is calculated for energy consumption. Some simulated results are validated by measurements with good agreement where a case study is conducted in an air-conditioned space of a library. With the proposed methodology, it can be recommended in a case study that the significant effects <b>of</b> <b>partition</b> on thermal comfort are observed in the regions where occupants feel warmer and in the regions where occupants feel uncomfortably cool after installing the partition while the energy consumption increases by 24 %. The <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>partition</b> at the desired location is not encouraged regarding to occupant's comfort and energy consumption without modification of the air-conditioning units...|$|R

Researches on the acoustic conditions of NICU in Indonesia are still limited. The acoustical study conducted in this research is using objective, subjective, and simulation methods based on soundscape concept with the concern on the nurse’s perception. This research was conducted at a national hospital in Jakarta. According to National Standardization Agency of Indonesia (SNI) and World Health Organization (WHO), the suitable sound pressure level (SPL) for noise in patient’s room is 35 dBA. From the study, it was found that the equivalent SPL value exceeded the standard. Soundscape in NICU can be improve with the addition of curtain on the incubator’s side, <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> glass <b>partition,</b> and ceiling absorber in the nurse station area. The result of simulation showed that the SPL in the room decreased with average value 8. 9 dBA for sound source alarm ventilator and 8. 2 dBA for sound source medical officer conversations. And the speech transmission index (STI) increased from “bad” to “good” range became “fair” to “excellent” range...|$|R
40|$|Partition {{walls are}} {{considered}} {{as one of the}} most crucial elements on interior space within the buildings. While a considerable amount of research has been carried out studying theses critical elements to be used on the interior space of the buildings, BIM has not been exploited so far in order to enhance the accuracy of work. Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to compare three types <b>of</b> commonly used <b>partition</b> walls in terms of materials, time and cost needed to install each of them using BIM. To achieve the specified goal, a case study was chosen. The framework used in this study consists <b>of</b> modeling the <b>installation</b> steps <b>of</b> each <b>partition</b> wall based on the chosen case study using Revit Architecture and Autodesk Inventor. In order to calculate the materials, time and cost required, Naviswork Manage was employed and it was found that drywall could be considered as the most useful one to be installed on the interior space of the buildings in comparison to the other two types <b>of</b> <b>partitions...</b>|$|R

It {{was the first time}} a New York City bus operator had been killed on the job since an incident on the [...] in 1981, where another bus driver was fatally shot, also because the driver had refused to give the passenger a transfer. The incident led to the strict enforcement of the MTA policy not to confront fare evaders, and <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> Plexiglas <b>partitions</b> on many city buses to protect bus operators; previously drivers were only protected by a single metal bar. The pilot program for the bus partitions began at the Flatbush Depot, where the B46 is dispatched from, in 2009. The same year as Thomas's stabbing, the MTA and New York City Police Department (NYPD) began deploying teams of police officers as well as squads of uniformed and plainclothes transit security officials (called EAGLE teams) on the B46 and other target routes to crack down on fare evaders, {{in the spirit of the}} broken windows theory.

5|$|The library has {{undergone}} a number of repairs and renovations. Between 1948 and 1949, Macon was closed for a repainting, the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> new windows, {{the addition of a}} new heater, and the removal <b>of</b> <b>partitions</b> in its reading areas. Efforts to modernize the library's interior space took place from 1973 to 1977 including an HVAC upgrade, the construction of an auditorium, and the <b>installation</b> <b>of</b> fluorescent lighting. Around 1996, the library was being rehabilitated once again, with efforts underway to improve library accessibility and the building's air conditioning system, and to install a new roof designed to mimic the original roof. The latter project was headed by the architect Leslie Defer. Macon was again renovated between 2006 and 2008 by Sen Architects. The project was intended to bring the library closer to its original appearance by making HVAC systems less visible and replacing the hanging fluorescent lights with lamps like those in the space when it opened. The renovation also included the addition of the African American Heritage Center.|$|R
