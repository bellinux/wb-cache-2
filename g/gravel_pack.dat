5000|$|Multi-screen casing completion: the MLS is {{installed}} {{inside of a}} multi-screened steel or PVC well. Each well screen segment has a sand or <b>gravel</b> <b>pack</b> {{between it and the}} borehole wall, and is thus isolated from monitoring zones above and below by a grout or bentonite seal. The MLS is then constructed inside of the multi-screened well. This adds another step to the well installation process (i.e., first installing a multi-screened well), but has several advantages. First, installing conventional steel or PVC wells is straightforward and routine for most drilling contractors. Consequently, it is not necessary that the drilling contractor have expertise in installing multilevel monitoring systems. Once the multi-screened wells have been installed and developed, the drilling contractor's job is done, and the multilevel systems can often be installed by field technicians, often at a lower cost. Second, the various monitoring zones can be developed using standard well development equipment and procedures before the multilevel monitoring systems are installed in the wells. Finally, installing multilevel systems inside multi-screened wells may simplify the task of decommissioning the wells once they are no longer needed. Most of the multilevel systems can be constructed {{so that they can be}} easily removed from the multi-screened wells. Then, the multi-screened wells can be pressure-grouted or drilled out using standard well decommissioning procedures.|$|E

The two vertical displacements were done to calculate the absolute permeability, relative permeabilities and saturations. Production performance and displacement efficiency was also determined to find out the recovery of the vertical displacement. The horizontal displacement was performed to see the occurrence of viscous fingering. It was assumed that after a certain time, water started to cone upwards towards the well and entered the <b>gravel</b> <b>pack.</b> Then the experimental part was to see on how the water was fingering through the <b>gravel</b> <b>pack.</b> Viscous fingering appeared in both horizontal and vertical displacement. The vertical displacement was also affected by gravity segregation. This was because the displacing water is denser than the displaced oil and the displacing direction is vertical upwards. Two models have been designed for modeling the <b>gravel</b> <b>pack.</b> The original model was based on experimental setup of the formation and the <b>gravel</b> <b>pack,</b> to see water coning effect in <b>gravel</b> <b>pack.</b> The revised model is the horizontal model used for experimental visualization of the water flow through <b>gravel</b> <b>pack...</b>|$|E

The source areas of these domestic wells {{and the effect of}} an extended <b>gravel</b> <b>pack</b> on the source area are typically unknown, and few resources exist for estimating these. In this article, we use detailed, high-resolution ground water model-ing to estimate the capture zone (source area) of a typical domestic well located in an alluvial aquifer.

Duration of one stage is equal to time which is necessary for reagent to pass ring part.

40|$|Abstract: Sand {{production}} in water, {{oil and gas}} wells is usually controlled by gravel packing techniques worldwide. Consideration in the <b>gravel</b> <b>pack</b> design requires that the particle size is {{five or six times}} the formation sand depending on the formation sand median diameter. Sieve analysis result shows that the grain sizes of sand and gravel of the Ethiope River sediments fall within the size range (0. 378 - 12. 0 mm) recommended for a <b>gravel</b> <b>pack</b> by the American Petroleum Institute. Acid solubility test on the gravel and sand gives desirable results as the maximum solubility of 1. 0 % required for gavel pack is not exceeded. The sphericity and roundness of the particle grains range from 0. 70 - 0. 68 and 0. 70 - 0. 67 respectively, which is within the range (0. 6) allowed for <b>gravel</b> <b>pack.</b> The presence of the objectionably high content of silt and clay in some of the samples particularly those collected near the Ethiope River source area (e. g.

40|$|The {{production}} of sand from poorly consolidated formation {{is a problem}} that has plagued {{the oil and gas industry}} for a long time. The problem of sanding can be alleviated by producing under the critical flow rate that triggers sand production. However, this critical production rate is usually small and uneconomical. Therefore, some from of sand control is employed of which the mechanical sand retention, i. e. <b>gravel</b> <b>pack</b> and sand control screen are the most popular. The use of sand control devices inevitably causes decline in well productivity, which is characterized by the additional pressure drop across the device(s). The drop in productivity is often aggravated by high velocity and two-phase flow. A computer simulation program will be developed to evaluate the prodcutivity of <b>gravel</b> <b>pack</b> and sand control screen with a few assumptions such as semi-steady state flow around the wellbore, perforations are treated as perfect cylinders and the annulus between the perforation and screen is completely filled with gravel. For screen only completion, the natural sand bridging will not be considered. For the <b>gravel</b> <b>pack,</b> a three-dimensional, two-phase finite difference scheme will be developed that is capable of modelling the dispersed flow pattern, which exists in the <b>gravel</b> <b>pack.</b> The effect of turbulence would be accounted for by means of the Forschheimer's equation. A dedicated, CFD based model will be used to study the fluid flow across sand control screens. The pressure drop associated with perforations will be calculated using correlations based on the finite-element modeling. Such phenomena as partial penetration, drilling damage and perforation damage will be included. The resulting package can be used to study the effect on overall productivity of such factors as perforation density, geometry, flow rate and fluid properties...|$|E

According to investigation and analysis, {{we learn that}} the <b>gravel</b> <b>packing</b> has been used widespread in sand control when the contents of {{fine particles}} are high. Based on designing the pre-packed screen, different fine particles sand control research is completed combining with test method. (1) We find that the sequence of fine particles flowing into the well has {{an enormous impact on}} the screen jam rate, and the smaller the fine particle diameter, the more obvious the screen plugging. The jam rate for the pure clay is five times with pure fine-silty sand, and four times with mixture of the fine-silty sand and the clay. When the experimental achieve octet stability, the Fluid Productivity Index Per-Meter (FPIPM) of the pure clay is pretty much equivalent with the mixture of the fine-silty sand and the clay. It is 70  % of the pure fine-silty sand FPIPM but has limited influence to effectiveness of the blockage.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work is to study slurry transport in horizontal openhole <b>gravel</b> <b>packing</b> and to investigate the process of sedimentation, both inside work string and for alpha wave. An attempt to quantify the amount of gravel deposited in the work string is made, since control of the gravel consumption is vital for {{the outcome of the}} operation, and uncontrolled sedimentation can cause unnecessary confusion during the packing process. A practical and straightforward method to quantify the gravel deposition in horizontal section of the work string is presented. Sedimentation is strongly affected by internal pipe diameter and pump rate, and these parameters should be carefully evaluated through operational planning. The utilization of the presented model could aid in designing the slurry transport, by selecting the ideal pump rate and work string specifications. Modelling for typical pipe sizes shows a lower limit for the pump rate where sedimentation arises. Alpha wave design is a key factor for successful <b>gravel</b> <b>packing,</b> and the models typically used are either based on small-scale experiments or not specifically developed for <b>gravel</b> <b>packing.</b> Gruesbeck et al., Penberthy et al. and Oroskar and Turian models were used in this thesis to find the critical flow velocity. Estimating the actual flow velocity above alpha dune was performed using Gruesbeck et al. pressure drop balance and a proposed method for describing the flow rate split between the annuli. This allowed finding the corresponding alpha dune gravel fill for the distinct models. The true volumetric gravel fill percent was found based on data from the actual field case and compared to the modelled. Gruesbeck et al. showed the best fit. Oroskar and Turian model was not developed for <b>gravel</b> <b>packing</b> purpose, and results showed that it may not be suitable for the eccentric annular configuration encountered. Modelling of flow velocity was done using friction loss based on wall roughness, and it is believed to represent the overall friction, rather than characterize the borehole wall. Results from the work string modelling suggest that the phenomenon of bed surface friction needs to be investigated further for alpha wave. It is a considerable contributor to the frictional pressure loss, especially for higher gravel fill percentages. Using borehole wall roughness to calculate friction factor might not give the best representation of the reality. To verify the flow rate split and investigate the bed friction influence, a full-scale experiment involving true diameters of screens and washpipe should be conducted, and a proposal for this is given in the thesis...|$|R
40|$|Gravel packing is a {{well-known}} method in sand control where stabilizing the formation with gravel prevents the production of formation sand. Longer and more complex completion operations are making the business of completing wells continually changing with new challenges, new technology and new methods. The purpose of this thesis is to discuss the gravel placement in nearly vertical openhole systems with blank pipe sections between the screens. In vertical openhole completions with long blank pipe sections slurry and gravel settling regimes will occur differently compared to a conventional <b>gravel</b> <b>pack</b> operation without blank pipe sections. The {{reason for this is}} when a lower screen section is packed with gravel and the overlying section is with blank pipe, the carrier fluid can no longer flow through the lower screen. The gravel in the blank pipe sections is mainly settling due to gravitational forces and therefore displaces the carrier fluid, which flows upwards to the upper screen section. By simulating <b>gravel</b> <b>pack</b> operations with blank pipe sections in Halliburton’s laboratory scale model in Tananger it has recently been shown (with continuous pumping) that with a higher inclination on the well (less vertical), a better packing is achieved in the blank pipe section; a higher <b>gravel</b> <b>pack</b> efficiency is achieved. By analyzing and calculating theoretically how the gravel settles with regards to physical laws in fluid dynamics will give a better view on how to optimize the packing of gravel in the blank pipe sections in nearly vertical wells. How to optimize the packing in these blank pipe sections without the use of extensive expensive rig-time was one of several challenges that had {{to be taken into account}} during the work with this thesis.

A proposed 3.3 mi extension of the trail would connect it northwest to the nearby village of Freeville (also in the Town of Dryden), and eventually via the Varna / Fall Creek trail to Ithaca. It is <b>gravel</b> <b>packed</b> and suitable for bicycling, and is also level for the entire route.|$|R
