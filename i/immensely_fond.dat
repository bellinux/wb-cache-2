6000|$|Then came {{a honeymoon}} at Arundel, and the Mamma wept copiously before she allowed her one {{daughter}} to sail away to India {{under the care}} of Georgie Porgie the Bridegroom. Beyond any question, Georgie Porgie was <b>immensely</b> <b>fond</b> of his wife, and she was devoted to him as the best and greatest man in the world. When he reported himself at Bombay he felt justified in demanding a good station for his wife's sake; and, because he had made a little mark in Burma and was beginning to be appreciated, they allowed him nearly all that he asked for, and posted him to a station which we will call Sutrain. It stood upon several hills, and was styled officially a 'Sanitarium,' for the good reason that the drainage was utterly neglected. Here Georgie Porgie settled down, and found married life come very naturally to him. He did not rave, as do many bridegrooms, over the strangeness and delight of seeing his own true love sitting down to breakfast with him every morning 'as though it were the most natural thing in the world.' ...|$|E
60|$|But {{though he}} has {{disappeared}} as irrevocably as Eurydice, these minor questions may settle the major one above mentioned. How could Pendennis have got all that information about Ethel's goings-on at Baden, and with Lord Kew, unless she had told somebody--her husband, for instance, who, having made Pendennis an early confidant in his amour, gave him the whole story? Clive, Pendennis writes expressly, is travelling abroad with his wife. Who is that wife? By a most monstrous blunder, Mr. Pendennis killed Lord Farintosh's mother at one page and brought her to life again at another; but Rosey, who is so lately consigned to Kensal Green, it is not surely with her that Clive is travelling, for then Mrs. Mackenzie would probably be with them to a live certainty, and the tour would be by no means pleasant. How could Pendennis have got all those private letters, etc., but that the Colonel kept them in a teak box, which Clive inherited and made over to his friend? My belief then is, that in Fable-land somewhere Ethel and Clive are living most comfortably together: that she is <b>immensely</b> <b>fond</b> of his little boy, {{and a great deal}} happier now than they would have been had they married at first, when they took a liking to each other as young people. That picture of J. J.'s of Mrs. Clive Newcome (in the Crystal Palace Exhibition in Fable-land), is certainly not in the least like Rosey, who we read was fair; but it represents a tall, handsome, dark lady, who must be Mrs. Ethel.|$|E
6000|$|All {{this had}} been for Lady Beldonald an {{agitation}} so great that access to her apartment was denied for a time even to her sister-in-law. It was much more {{out of the question}} of course that she should unveil her face to a person of my special business with it; so that the question of the portrait was by common consent left to depend on that of the installation of a successor to her late companion. Such a successor, I gathered from Mrs. Munden, widowed childless and lonely, as well as inapt for the minor offices, she had absolutely to have; a more or less humble alter ago to deal with the servants, keep the accounts, make the tea and watch the window-blinds. Nothing seemed more natural than that she should marry again, and obviously that might come; yet the predecessors of Miss Dadd had been contemporaneous with a first husband, so that others formed in her image might be contemporaneous with a second. I was much occupied in those months at any rate, and these questions and their ramifications losing themselves for a while to my view, I was only brought back to them by Mrs. Munden's arrival one day with the news that we were all right again--her sister-in-law was once more [...] "suited." [...] A certain Mrs. Brash, an American relative whom she hadn't seen for years, but with whom she had continued to communicate, was to come out to her immediately; and this person, it appeared, could be quite trusted to meet the conditions. She was ugly--ugly enough, without abuse of it, and was unlimitedly good. The position offered her by Lady Beldonald was moreover exactly what she needed; widowed also, after many troubles and reverses, with her fortune of the smallest, and her various children either buried or placed about, she had never had time or means to visit England, and would really be grateful in her declining years for the new experience and the pleasant light work involved in her cousin's hospitality. They had been much together early in life and Lady Beldonald was <b>immensely</b> <b>fond</b> of her--would in fact have tried to get hold of her before hadn't Mrs. Brash been always in bondage to family duties, to the variety of her tribulations. I daresay I laughed at my friend's use of the term [...] "position"--the position, one might call it, of a candlestick or a sign-post, and I daresay I must have asked if the special service the poor lady was to render had been made clear to her. Mrs. Munden left me in any case with the rather droll image of her faring forth across the sea quite consciously and resignedly to perform it.|$|E

She paid tribute to the bloom in this painting, originally entitled Miracle Flower. Jimson Weed was commissioned by cosmetics magnate Elizabeth Arden for the new Gymnasium Moderne of her Fifth Avenue Salon in New York City. Placed in the exercise room, the unfurling blossoms were meant to encourage clients in their stretches. Arden paid the exorbitant sum of $10,000 for the largest floral composition O'Keeffe would ever create.|$|E

His real form is that of the [...] "round ball" [...] the doll holds. Many girls in the school are attracted to him for unknown reasons, which he says is because of his [...] "passionate eyes, deep voice and cute body". Incidentally, Marta (the Director of the academy) has a crush on him. He seems <b>immensely</b> <b>fond</b> of Ulrika, often trying to get her attention. His previous form was that of a raccoon and other animals (as said by Peperoni) and he describes his current form as that of a [...] "pegasus". His actual form is that of a tall red-haired man as seen in his ending.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 34 - 37) This thesis {{attempts to}} express my views of photorealism in relation to society, art history, art criticism and art education. I was first introduced to photorealism in 1976 at U. C. L. A., while earning my B. A. degree in Painting, Sculpture and Graphic Arts. Under the instruction of James Valerio, I began my first photorealist portrait, entitled ???Margaret. ??? Later at California State University, Northridge, {{under the supervision of}} Bruce Everett, I completed ???Margaret,??? and commenced work on two more photorealist portraits, ???Susan??? and ???Susan Positive/Negative. ??? At the same time, with the guidance and assistance of Dr. William Kasza and Dr. Paul Kravagna, I combined my interests in art education with my practical studio experience in photorealist painting. Since 1976, I have studied photorealism, as a style, technique and form of expression. During this period, I became aware of the controversial nature of photorealist expression: critics have often regarded photorealism as confining, restricting and trite. As I became more familiar with the techniques and demands of photorealism, gradually, I formed my own opinions, attitudes and philosophy toward art education in general, and particularly, photorealist instruction. I am grateful to have received instruction in realism at various stages of my art education, especially because it has provided me with the means to develop specific technical skills, and formulate creative and artistic goals. My realist and photorealist education has exposed me to a world which I have found stimulating, inspiring, and socially relevant. I cannot deny the importance of abstract art. Indeed, I am <b>immensely</b> <b>fond</b> of it: but to deny students realist instruction merely limits their ability to explore and investigate what is possible...|$|E
