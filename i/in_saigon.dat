5|$|As {{part of the}} {{evacuation}} plan agreed with the DAO, Air America committed 24 of its 28 available helicopters to support {{the evacuation}} and 31 pilots agreed to stay <b>in</b> <b>Saigon</b> to support the evacuation; this meant that most helicopters would have only one pilot rather than the usual two. At 08:30 on 29 April, with the shelling of Tan Son Nhut Airport subsiding, Air America began ferrying its helicopter and fixed-wing pilots from their homes <b>in</b> <b>Saigon</b> to the Air America compound at Tan Son Nhut, {{across the road from}} the DAO Compound. Air America helicopters started flying to the rooftop LZs <b>in</b> <b>Saigon</b> and either shuttled the evacuees back to the DAO Compound or flew out to the ships of TF76. By 10:30 all of Air America's fixed-wing aircraft had departed Tan Son Nhut, evacuating all non-essential personnel and as many Vietnamese evacuees as they could carry and headed for Thailand. At some point during the morning VNAF personnel took 5 ICCS UH1-H Hueys and one Air America Bell 204 from the Air America ramp.|$|E

5|$|The Buddhists <b>in</b> <b>Saigon</b> {{were aware}} that a raid on the pagodas was imminent. Buddhist {{relatives}} of Special Forces and combat police personnel had tipped off the monks, and Buddhists who lived near pagodas had observed them move into {{the region in the}} lead-up. American journalists were tipped off and traveled through Saigon to visit the pagodas ahead of the raids. The pagodas had been locked by the monks in preparation for the attacks and the doors were barricaded with furniture and reinforced by nailing wooden planks across them. The monks told members of the U.S. press corps <b>in</b> <b>Saigon</b> that the raids were coming, allowing them to be more prepared for the event than the U.S. embassy.|$|E

5|$|Although the U.S. command <b>in</b> <b>Saigon</b> and the {{politicians}} in Washington became increasingly aware of this arrangement during 19661967, they declined to overtly interfere due to the political ramifications of conducting military operations against a neutral country and the wishes of Sihanouk. Washington still had hopes of reopening a dialog with Sihanouk, and refrained from any actions that might alienate him further.|$|E
5|$|As the VPAF {{pilots were}} {{completing}} the final phases of their conversion training, the VPAF Command chose to attack Tan Son Nhut Air Base <b>in</b> <b>Saigon.</b> On {{the afternoon of}} April 27, the pilots were flown out to Phù Cát Air Base in Bình Định Province where Major-General Le Van Tri, commander of the VPAF, briefed them on the upcoming operation.

5|$|Diệm's {{government}} formulated procedural regulations ostensibly {{designed to}} ensure results and ballots were correctly accounted for and to prevent election fraud. In reality however, the votes were counted without independent supervision, which resulted in Diệm being credited with 98.2% of the vote. The prime minister tallied 605,025 votes <b>in</b> <b>Saigon,</b> although only 450,000 voters were registered in the capital. Diệm's tally exceeded the registration numbers in other districts. French newspapers claimed that {{only half of the}} registered voters <b>in</b> <b>Saigon</b> had actually voted, and that the rest had boycotted the election, implying that more than 60% of the votes in the capital were not authentic. Defenders of Diệm claim this was due to recently arrived, mostly Catholic, refugees from North Vietnam who voted without being enrolled, rather than large-scale ballot stuffing.|$|E
