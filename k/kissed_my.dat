They were put under the charge of Major-General Dennehy and first served the Queen at breakfast in Frogmore House at Windsor on 23 June 1887. The Queen {{described}} Karim in her diary for that day: [...] "The other, much younger, is much lighter , tall, and with a fine serious countenance. [...] His father is a native doctor at Agra. [...] They both <b>kissed</b> <b>my</b> feet." ...|$|E
500|$|... "The meeting {{which took}} place after Easter in 1967 lasted two minutes … I told him in a few words the purpose of my visit: for him to bless the Congregation of the Holy Ghost which was due to hold an {{extraordinary}} General Chapter meeting … Then Padre Pio cried out. 'Me, bless an archbishop, no, no, it is you who should be blessing me!' And he bowed, to receive the blessing. I blessed him, he <b>kissed</b> <b>my</b> ring and continued {{on his way to}} the confessional... That was the whole of the meeting, no more, no less..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Pope {{and other}} foreign dignitaries hailed Sobieski as the [...] "Savior of Vienna and Western European civilization." [...] In {{a letter to his}} wife, he wrote, [...] "All the common people <b>kissed</b> <b>my</b> hands, my feet, my clothes; others only touched me, saying: 'Ah, let us kiss so valiant a hand!'" ...|$|E
5000|$|Another {{possible}} inspiration {{could be}} the phrase [...] "pogue mahone" [...] from the Irish [...] "póg mo thóin" [...] meaning <b>kiss</b> <b>my</b> rump, <b>kiss</b> <b>my</b> bottom, or <b>kiss</b> <b>my</b> ass; the word [...] "póg" [...] meaning kiss. However, no references have been found that {{would allow us to}} trace such a derivation.|$|R

2500|$|During {{her time}} in Brazil Bishop became {{increasingly}} interested in the languages and literatures of Latin America. She was influenced by South and Central American poets, including the Mexican poet Octavio Paz and the Brazilian poets João Cabral de Melo Neto and Carlos Drummond de Andrade, and translated their work into English. Regarding de Andrade, she said, [...] "I didn't know him at all. He's supposed to be very shy. I'm supposed to be very shy. We've met once — on the sidewalk at night. We had {{just come out of}} the same restaurant, and he <b>kissed</b> <b>my</b> hand politely when we were introduced." [...] After Soares took her own life in 1967, Bishop spent more time in the United States.|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1904, KR became {{somewhat}} {{attached to}} an attractive young {{man by the name}} of Yatsko. [...] "I sent for Yatsko and he came this morning. I easily persuaded him to be candid. It was strange for me to hear him describe the familiar characteristics: he has never felt drawn to a woman, and has been infatuated with men several times. I did not confess to him that I knew these feelings from my own personal experience. Yatsko and I talked for a long time. Before leaving he <b>kissed</b> <b>my</b> face and hands; I should not have allowed this, and should have pushed him away, however I was punished afterwards by vague feelings of shame and remorse. He told me that, ever since the first time we met, his soul has been filled with rapturous feelings towards me, which grow all the time. How this reminds me of my own youth." [...] A few days later, KR and Yatsko met again, and a relationship developed between the two.|$|E
2500|$|Allison Stewart of The Washington Post {{found the}} song to be [...] "galloping, out-of-place synth-rock number" [...] {{and added that}} [...] "even Adele can't save" [...] the song. Nick Freed of Consequence of Sound said that [...] "Set Fire to the Rain" [...] finds Adele at [...] "her strongest and most open." [...] He further called the song [...] "one of 21s angrier tracks" [...] and concluded: [...] "The chorus' hooks are crazy catchy, and by the final one Adele {{releases}} and her hurt slips through the anger {{to give you a}} damn real and forward show of emotion. I’d imagine seeing this song live or in a stripped down setting would make one bawl like a child. You’ll want to pump your fist and pound your chest. That’s a guarantee." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy praised the song saying, [...] "'It was dark and I was over/ Until you <b>kissed</b> <b>my</b> lips and saved me,' she admits over a gloomy piano riff, before launching into a ballsy, hands-in-the-air chorus. 'I set fire to the rain/ and I threw us into the flames,' she belts with growly vocals against cinematic strings. Rounding out with a suitably breathtaking blast from her impressive pipes and the result sounds like classic, though it's anything but camp." ...|$|E
