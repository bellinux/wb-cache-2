50|$|Oftentimes {{found in}} the retina, bipolar cells are crucial as they serve as both direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>cell</b> pathways. The {{specific}} location of the bipolar cells allow them to facilitate the pathway of signals both where they start in the receptors as well as where they arrive at the ganglion cells. Bipolar cells in the retina are also unique as they do not fire impulses like the other cells found within the retina. Rather, bipolar cells have a receptive-field that surrounds them. Therefore, bipolar cells may exist as off-center or on-center. The off-center bipolar cells possess excitatory relationships with the synapses and are hyperpolarized by light. On-center bipolar cells have inhibitory synapses and therefore are suppressed in the dark.|$|E

Despite some evidence which suggests that these phagocytic cells had little function in the response, one cannot ascertain whether the lymphoid cells were responding directly to a second contact with antigen or whether the few contaminating phagocytic cells were performing a function essential to the response by the lymphoid cells. Physiologically different populations of cells appear to develop after priming {{and are able to}} respond in vitro in a macrophage-poor culture.

Because zinc deficiency, {{as well as other}} nutritional deficiences, causes extensive damage to the immune system, the question arose as to whether zinc-deficient mice could repair the thymus and fully regenerate T-cell helper function if returned to diets containing adequate amounts of zinc. Five-week-old A/J female mice were fed either a zinc-deficient (< 1 μg of Zn per g) or a zinc-adequate (50 μg of Zn per g) diet for 31 days. Histological examination of thymuses from the zinc-deficient mice revealed that the cortex was preferentially involuted and the thymus was about one-third of normal size. The direct plaque-forming cells produced per mouse spleen in response to immunization with sheep erythrocytes was 34 % of normal; <b>indirect</b> plaque-forming <b>cells</b> were 18 % of normal (Jerne plaque assay). After the deficient mice had been fed a zinc-adequate diet for 1 week, their response was nearly normal, except that the indirect response was 68 % of controls; in this same period, the thymuses of these mice had quadrupled in size and exhibited a greatly enlarged cortex repopulated with immature thymocytes.

40|$|Vertical {{transport}} of heat by ocean circulation is investigated using a coupled climate model and novel thermodynamic methods. Using a streamfunction in temperature-depth coordinates, cells are identified by {{whether they are}} thermally direct (flux heat upward) or indirect (flux heat downward). These cells are then projected into geographical and other thermodynamic coordinates. Three cells are identified in the model: a thermally direct cell coincident with Antarctic Bottom Water, a thermally <b>indirect</b> deep <b>cell</b> coincident with the upper limb of the meridional overturning circulation, and a thermally direct shallow cell coincident with the subtropical gyres at the surface. The mechanisms maintaining the thermally <b>indirect</b> deep <b>cell</b> are investigated. Sinking water within the deep cell is more saline than that which upwells, because of the coupling between the upper limb and the subtropical gyres in a broader thermohaline circulation. Despite the higher salinity of its sinking water, the deep cell transports buoyancy downward, requiring a source of mechanical energy.

We studied quantitatively the production of cells releasing IgM hemolysins (direct plaque-forming <b>cells),</b> IgG hemolysins (<b>indirect</b> plaque-forming <b>cells),</b> and hemagglutinins (cluster-forming cells). We found {{that each of these}} immunocyte populations was distinct, i. e., that cells releasing agglutinins did not, as a rule, release hemolysins, and vice versa. We also found that cell populations secreting IgM hemolysins did not shift, under certain experimental conditions, to the production of IgG hemolysins during the primary immune response. By transplanting graded numbers of spleen cells, we succeeded in limiting to one or a few the number of antigen-sensitive units that reached the recipient spleen. We estimated thereby the frequency of antigen-sensitive units in donor cell suspensions and tested their potential for production of immunocytes of more than one type. Our results indicated that antigen-sensitive units were unipotent for they displayed in the spleens of unprimed donors the same restrictions of function and heterogeneity (antibody-specificity differentiation, antibody-class differentiation) found among antibody-forming cells. Furthermore, antigen-sensitive precursors for direct plaque-forming <b>cells,</b> <b>indirect</b> plaque-forming <b>cells,</b> and cluster-forming cells were detected in the spleens of unprimed mice in different frequencies, i. e., 1 in ∼ 106, 1 in ∼ 7 x 106, and 1 in ∼ 19 x 106 spleen cells, respectively.

40|$|The {{amplification}} of {{the gene}} MYCN (V-myc myelocytomatosis viral-valeted oncogene, neuroblastoma derived) has been a well-documented indicator for poor prognosis in neuroblastoma, a childhood cancer. Unfortunately, there has been limited success in understanding MYCN functionality in the landscape of neuroblastoma and more importantly, given that MYCN has been deemed undruggable, the need to potentially illuminate key opportunities that indirectly target MYCN is of great interest. To this end, this work employs an emerging quantitative technique from network science, namely network curvature, to quantify the biological robustness of MYCN and its surrounding neighborhood. In particular, when amplified in Stage IV cancer, MYCN exhibits higher curvature (more robust) than those samples with under expressed MYCN levels. When examining the surrounding neighborhood, the above argument still holds for network curvature, but is lost when only analyzing differential expression - a common technique amongst oncologists and computational/molecular biologists.

We use a general circulation model of the atmosphere in an aquaplanet configuration with prescribed sea surface temperature and investigate {{the influence of the}} gravitational acceleration g on the structure of the circulation. For g=g₀= 9. 81 ms⁻², three meridional cells exist in each hemisphere. Up to about g/g₀= 1. 4 all cells increase in strength. Further increasing this ratio results in a weakening of the thermally <b>indirect</b> <b>cell,</b> such that a two- and finally a one-cell structure of the meridional circulation develops in each hemisphere. This transition is explained by the primary driver of the thermally direct Hadley cell: the diabatic heating at the equator which is proportional to g.

The technologies that have recently emerged in the clinic for the selective hemosorption of endotoxin in combination with dynamic monitoring of its blood level (LAL test) open up wide prospects for the treatment of abdominal sepsis.
