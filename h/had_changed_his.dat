In 1965, the U.S. Army published a multi-volume history of World War II, including one on The Ardennes: The Battle of the Bulge. Author Hugh M. Cole only briefly mentioned Bouck's platoon, which upset former platoon member William James (who <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> name from Tsakanikas). James contacted Bouck and encouraged him to get his men proper recognition.|$|E
5|$|By his own account, in {{the late}} 1950s, while living in San Francisco, young John A. Carradine was arrested for assaulting a police officer; he pleaded to a lesser charge of {{disturbing}} the peace. While in the Army (1960–1962) he faced court-martial, {{on more than one}} occasion, for shoplifting. After he became an established actor and <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> name to David, he was arrested, in 1967, for possession of marijuana.|$|E
5|$|Crittenden {{remained}} in Washington {{for a few}} weeks after Congress adjourned. Having learned that John Archibald Campbell, an Alabaman serving on the Supreme Court, had decided to resign in light of his state's secession, President Lincoln proposed to appoint Crittenden to the vacant seat. Lincoln's cabinet approved, and the nomination papers were drafted, but Campbell belatedly reconsidered his resignation, {{and by the time he}} definitely determined to resign, Lincoln <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> mind regarding Crittenden's nomination.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, {{the late}} King had only insisted on that oath {{to protect the}} {{stability}} of the kingdom, and in light of the chaos that might now ensue, Stephen would be justified in ignoring it. Henry was also able to persuade Hugh Bigod, the late King's royal steward, to swear that the King <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> mind about the succession on his deathbed, nominating Stephen instead. Stephen's coronation was held a week later at Westminster Abbey on 22 December.|$|E
5|$|On March 17, Booth {{learned that}} Lincoln would be {{attending}} {{a performance of}} the play Still Waters Run Deep at a hospital near the Soldier's Home. Booth assembled his team on a stretch of road near the Soldier's Home {{in the attempt to}} kidnap Lincoln en route to the hospital, but the president did not appear. Booth later learned that Lincoln <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> plans at the last moment to attend a reception at the National Hotel in Washington where, coincidentally, Booth was then staying.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the election, Dato' Onn Ja'afar <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> approach, {{forming the}} Parti Negara after IMP {{suffered}} crushing losses to the Alliance in local elections. Advocating stronger pro-Malay policies recognising Malay political dominance, the Parti Negara failed {{to shake the}} Alliance's grip on power. However, some believe Parti Negara's proposals helped sway UMNO politicians towards more radically pro-Malay policies. The British themselves insisted on handing over power only to a multiracial government, and the Alliance was considered to meet this requirement.|$|E

5|$|At first, Innocent {{took the}} side of the monks, and lifted Pica's excommunication. While the newest appeal was taking place, Pica and a number of his supporters, who had {{traveled}} to Rome to appeal in person, died in Rome in 1200, and some of the monks alleged this was by poison administered on the orders of Savaric. Meanwhile, Innocent <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> mind, and reinstalled Savaric as abbot, ordering some English clergy to judge the specifics of the case, and allot the revenues of the abbey between Savaric and the monks. Savaric then attempted to secure more control over other monasteries in his diocese, but died before he could set the plans in motion.|$|E
5|$|During the Jacobite Rising of 1745, the Jacobites under Charles Edward Stuart stormed Dunrobin Castle without warning, {{because the}} Clan Sutherland {{supported}} the British government. The 17th Earl of Sutherland, who <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> surname from Gordon to Sutherland, narrowly escaped them, exiting through a back door. He sailed for Aberdeen where {{he joined the}} Duke of Cumberland's army. On {{the death of the}} 18th Earl in 1766, the house passed to his daughter, Elizabeth, who married the politician George Leveson-Gower, later created 1st Duke of Sutherland. In 1785, the house was altered and extended again.|$|E
5|$|Edmund FitzAlan {{was born}} in the Castle of Marlborough, in Wiltshire, on 1 May 1285. He was the son of Richard FitzAlan, 8th Earl of Arundel, and his wife, Alice of Saluzzo, {{daughter}} of Thomas I of Saluzzo in Italy. Richard had been in opposition to the king during the political crisis of 1295, and as a result he had incurred great debts and had parts of his land confiscated. When Richard died in 09/03/1301, Edmund's wardship was given to John de Warenne, Earl of Surrey. Warenne's only son, William, had died in 1286, so his daughter Alice was now heir apparent to the Warenne earldom. Alice was offered in marriage to Edmund, who for unknown reasons initially refused her. By 1305 he <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> mind, however, and the two were married.|$|E

5|$|His {{time in the}} Senate allowed Blaine {{to develop}} his foreign policy ideas. He {{advocated}} expansion of the American navy and merchant marine, which had been in decline since the Civil War. Blaine also bitterly opposed {{the results of the}} arbitration with Great Britain over American fishermen’s right to fish in Canadian waters, which resulted in a $5.5 million award to Britain. Blaine’s Anglophobia combined with his support of high tariffs. He had initially opposed a reciprocity treaty with Canada that would have reduced tariffs between the two nations, {{but by the end of}} his time in the Senate, he <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> mind, believing that Americans had more to gain by increasing exports than they would lose by the risk of cheap imports.|$|E
5|$|Live {{television}} {{coverage of the}} race began at 3:30p.m. EST in the United States on Fox. Around {{the start of the}} race, weather conditions were sunny, between , and no rain was expected. Gusty winds from the north created strong headwinds on the back straight. Kenny Farmer, chaplain of Las Vegas Motor Speedway, began pre-race ceremonies with an invocation. Actress Carol Linnae Johnson of the stage production Mamma Mia! performed the national anthem, and John Byers, co-director of UAW-Chrysler National Training Center, commanded the drivers to start their engines. During the pace laps, two drivers moved {{to the rear of the}} field because of unapproved changes: Bowyer had switched to a back-up car, and Kahne <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> engine.|$|E
5|$|Stevenson opposed {{almost every}} effort to expand blacks' rights beyond the {{minimums}} assured by federal amendments and legislation. The Civil Rights Act of 1866 guaranteed that blacks could testify against whites in federal courts, but he opposed New Departure Democrats when they insisted that Kentucky amend its laws to also allow black testimony against whites in state courts, and the measure failed in the 1867 legislative session. Later that year, the Kentucky Court of Appeals declared the Civil Rights Act unconstitutional, but a federal court soon overturned that decision. Stevenson backed Bourbon Democrats' appeal of that decision to the Supreme Court of the United States. By 1871, however, he <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> mind and supported blacks' right to testify. Despite Stevenson's support, the measure failed in the General Assembly again in 1871, but it passed the following year, after Stevenson had left office.|$|E

5|$|The Togolese {{team for}} the 2004 Athens Games {{featured}} canoeist Boukpeti competing in the men's K-1. This was his debut at an Olympic Games, although he would later return for both the 2008 and 2012 Games. Boukpeti had competed for France as a junior, but switched allegiance in adulthood to Togo since his father was born there. Boukpeti had only ever visited the country once, as a child. Boukpeti <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> national allegiance {{in order to make}} Olympic qualification easier. He was the only competitor for an African national at the 2004 Games in the events held at the Deodoro Olympic Whitewater Stadium.|$|E
5|$|The {{start of}} his 2011 season saw him take a fourth {{consecutive}} national title over 60m with a European-leading time. At the 2011 European Athletics Indoor Championships the following month he was beaten to the line by Obikwelu, although he {{was pleased with the}} silver medal as he <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> training to focus towards the 100m for that season. Four straight wins on the Brazilian Athletics Tour came {{at the beginning of his}} outdoor season in May, including a season's best of 10.01seconds, and he took his fifth national title at the British trials. At the 2011 World Championships he reached the 100m semi-finals but fell foul of the IAAF's new false start rule: he twitched in his blocks and was immediately disqualified.|$|E
5|$|Berkman {{spent his}} last years eking out a {{precarious}} living {{as an editor}} and translator. He and his companion, Emmy Eckstein, relocated frequently within Nice in search of smaller and less expensive quarters. Aronstam, who <b>had</b> <b>changed</b> <b>his</b> name to Modest Stein and attained success as an artist, became a benefactor, sending Berkman a monthly sum to help with expenses. In the 1930s his health began to deteriorate, and he underwent two unsuccessful operations for a prostate condition in early 1936. After the second surgery, he was bed-ridden for months. In constant pain, forced {{to rely on the}} financial help of friends and dependent on Eckstein's care, Berkman decided to commit suicide. In the early hours of June28, 1936, unable to endure the physical pain of his ailment, Berkman tried to shoot himself in the heart with a handgun, but he failed to make a clean job of it. The bullet punctured a lung and his stomach and lodged in his spinal column, paralyzing him. Goldman rushed to Nice to be at his side. Berkman recognized her but was unable to speak. He sank into a coma in the afternoon, and died at 10o'clock that night.|$|E
