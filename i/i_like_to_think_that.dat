However, in September 2010, she ruled out a return, saying, [...] "It was a bit selfish of me but I didn't want to be killed off. I am never going to go back but <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> 's still out there somewhere." [...] At the recording of the new series of The Rob Brydon Show for BBC Two, Brydon asked if she would consider returning, to which Windsor replied, [...] "Never say never".|$|E
500|$|Due to {{his support}} for the LGBT community, and his {{portrayal}} of gay characters in his projects, Franco's sexuality has been a subject of discussion in [...] media sources, relentlessly questioning if he himself is gay. In response to questions regarding his sexuality, he insists he finds plenty more dimensions to the characters than their bedroom proclivities. [...] "Or, you know what," [...] he quipped, [...] "maybe I’m just gay". In a March 2015 interview with Four Two Nine magazine, Franco again opened up about his sexuality, commenting that it is not who you have sex with that defines your sexuality, but instead how you act. [...] "In the twenties and thirties, they used to define homosexuality by how you acted and not by whom you slept with. Sailors would fuck guys all the time, but as long as they behaved in masculine ways, they weren’t considered gay". Franco added, [...] "Well, <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I’m gay in my art and straight in my life".|$|E

It's a mix of Native American, Buddhist and transcendental ideas. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of earth as mother. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> of sky as grandfather. God {{has been used for}} ulterior motives." [...] In another interview, he has said: [...] "I believe very firmly that indigenous populations had a really good, intuitive understanding of why we're here. And we're trying to gain that same understanding through psychology and intellect in modern civilization." ...|$|R

500|$|In September 2014, Chris was {{the focus}} of a coward punch storyline. During Kyle and Georgia's joint bucks and hen night, Chris was forced to eject a drunk Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) from The Waterhole when he caused a scene. Shortly after, Josh {{returned}} and hit Chris with a coward punch, causing him to fall and hit his head on a rock. Kyle and Georgia found Chris unconscious and he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Mason was pleased to be given the storyline, explaining that it was a topical issue in Australia at the time. He said [...] "The whole moral of the story is that one little mistake can have really dire consequences. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> we can use this story to really educate people and get the word out there that this is something really serious that we're battling against at the moment." [...] Mason thought that Chris might be able to forgive Josh in the future, but it would be [...] "a long process", and he would {{have to deal with the}} fact that his life had changed forever due to the attack first. Mason added that Chris would have difficulties accepting that someone like Josh attacked him.|$|E

During the 2000s he issued three more albums, One More Time – Live at St Andrews (2001), Highlights of Bob Barnard's Jazz Party (2003) and Mine & Some I Adopted (2005). Tilders {{described}} his concept {{for the latter}} album, [...] "he idea was to show-case what I love to do best, playing solo, without the restrictions of an ensemble". He categorised his style of music [...] "ome of it is not strictly blues but it has {{the basis of that}} genre. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> the listener gets a good feeling and doesn't take me too seriously. I'm a little irreverent at times but tongue in cheek".|$|E
2500|$|Ryan's {{poems are}} often quite short. In {{one of the}} first essays on Ryan, Dana Gioia wrote about this aspect of her poetry. [...] "Ryan reminds us of the suggestive power of poetry–how it elicits and rewards the reader’s intellect, imagination, and emotions. <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> Ryan’s magnificently {{compressed}} poetry – along with the emergence of other new masters of the short poem like Timothy Murphy and H.L. Hix and the veteran maestri like Ted Kooser and Dick Davis – signals a return to concision and intensity." [...] Ryan tends to avoid using the personal [...] "I" [...] in her poetry, claiming that she [...] "didn’t want confession. [...] didn’t want to be Anne Sexton." [...] Though distanced, her work is often deeply introspective, analyzing both the nature of the mind [...] and the ability of language to mold reality.|$|E

2500|$|Lone Wolf {{was one of}} {{the first}} Indian artists to paint other Indians, and Indian subjects. He was also one of the first Indian artists to be academically trained in art. [...] He was known for both his {{painting}} and sculpting skills. He played a [...] "significant role" [...] in capturing the events of the American West during the latter part of the 1800s and the early part of the 1900s. He had personal experience, as well as his tribe's personal knowledge of people and events. He was the first Indian to achieve national recognition as an artist, creating over 500 paintings. He was influenced and encouraged by Thomas Moran, who he met during his time wrangling at the Grand Canyon, and his style has been compared to that of Frederic Remington and Charles Marion Russell. Russell also encouraged and instructed Lone Wolf in his early career. Lone Wolf had his first solo show in Los Angeles in 1917. The headline in the Los Angeles Times about the exhibition read, [...] "Vance Thompson Discovers Wonderful Indian Artist, An Artist With a Vision." [...] In that article, Vance Thompson said of Lone Wolf, [...] "The message he has to give is his own; and already he has shaped – if he has not perfected – a distinct, individual and interesting technique." [...] He went to say, [...] "It is a rare thing to discover an artist. I have seen the young painters pass in droves through the schools and salons of Paris, and in 20 years I can claim to have been the discoverer of only one great artist. Now <b>I</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>that</b> I have, at last, discovered another and he is an artist who has authentic vision, sincerity and a brush which is already capable of doing precisely the thing he wants it to..." ...|$|E

But I daresay he had no more soul than the creatures {{of the woods and}} forests who made pipes from reeds and bathed in the {{mountain}} streams when the world was young, and you might catch sight of little fawns galloping through the glade {{on the back of a}} bearded centaur. A soul is a troublesome possession and when man developed it he lost the Garden of Eden." ...|$|E
