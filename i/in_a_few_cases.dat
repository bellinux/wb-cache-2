5|$|Djedkare is well attested in sources {{contemporaneous}} {{with his}} reign. The tombs {{of many of}} his courtiers and family members have been discovered in Giza, Saqqara and Abusir. They give insights into the administrative reforms that Djedkare conducted during his reign and, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>cases,</b> even record letters that the king sent to his officials. These letters, inscribed on the walls of tombs, typically present royal praises for the tomb owner.|$|E
5|$|Pilgrimages were {{a popular}} {{religious}} practice throughout the Middle Ages in England, with the tradition {{dating back to}} the Roman period. Typically pilgrims would travel short distances to a shrine or a particular church, either to do penance for a perceived sin, or to seek relief from an illness or other condition. Some pilgrims travelled further, either to more distant sites within Britain or, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>cases,</b> onto the continent.|$|E
5|$|Tales of love often involve incest, or the {{seduction}} or rape of a mortal woman {{by a male}} god, resulting in heroic offspring. The stories generally suggest that relationships between gods and mortals are something to avoid; even consenting relationships rarely have happy endings. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>cases,</b> a female divinity mates with a mortal man, as in the Homeric Hymn to Aphrodite, where the goddess lies with Anchises to produce Aeneas.|$|E

5|$|The {{church does}} not require that Christian Scientists avoid all medical care—adherents use dentists, optometrists, obstetricians, {{physicians}} for broken bones, and vaccination when required by law—but maintains that Christian-Science prayer is most effective when not combined with medicine. Between the 1880s and 1990s the avoidance of medical treatment led {{to the deaths of}} several adherents and their children. Parents and others were prosecuted for, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>cases</b> convicted of, manslaughter or neglect.|$|E
5|$|After {{its last}} {{performance}} at the Gaiety in 1872, Thespis appears to have remained unperformed until 1953, although an attempted reconstruction from the 1940s has been discovered. Tillett and Spencer, who discovered the ballet music, identified twenty separate reconstructions of Thespis between 1953 and 2002. About half of these use music adapted from Sullivan's other works; the others use new music {{for all but the}} surviving songs, or, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>cases,</b> re-compose those as well. No version has become predominant in recent productions.|$|E
5|$|However, not all peptide {{bonds are}} formed in this way. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>cases,</b> {{peptides}} are synthesized by specific enzymes. For example, the tripeptide glutathione {{is an essential}} part of the defenses of cells against oxidative stress. This peptide is synthesized in two steps from free amino acids. In the first step, gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase condenses cysteine and glutamic acid through a peptide bond formed between the side chain carboxyl of the glutamate (the gamma carbon of this side chain) and the amino group of the cysteine. This dipeptide is then condensed with glycine by glutathione synthetase to form glutathione.|$|E

5|$|Some true fungi specialise in the {{colonisation}} of the Myxogastriae: {{almost all}} of these are species of sac fungi. The most common such fungus is Verticillium rexianummainly species from Comatricha or Stemonitis. Gliocladium album and Sesquicillium microsporum are often found on Physaridae, while Polycephalomyces tomentosus is often found on certain species of Trichiidae. Nectriopsis violacea specialises on Fuligo septica. Bacterial associates, mainly from the family Enterobacteriaceae, were discovered on plasmodia. The combination of plasmodia and bacteria can bind atmospheric nitrogen or produce enzymes which make possible the decomposition of e.g. lignin, carboxymethylcellulose or xylan. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>cases,</b> the plasmodia acquired salt tolerance or tolerance of heavy metals through this association.|$|E
5|$|The Russians avoided Napoleon's {{objective}} of a decisive engagement and instead retreated deeper into Russia. A brief attempt at resistance {{was made at}} Smolensk in August; the Russians were defeated {{in a series of}} battles, and Napoleon resumed his advance. The Russians again avoided battle, although <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>cases</b> this was only achieved because Napoleon uncharacteristically hesitated to attack when the opportunity arose. Owing to the Russian army's scorched earth tactics, the French found it increasingly difficult to forage food for themselves and their horses.|$|E
5|$|The {{symmetry}} {{on earth}} mirrors the symmetric perfection of heaven. The purpose {{of art at}} this time—in architecture, the visual arts, and music—was not to create something entirely new, but to reflect this divine perfection, {{and in this way}} to praise God. We find such a symmetric outline in many pieces by Johann Sebastian Bach,19 but only <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>cases</b> is this outline as consequent as in the B Minor Mass.

Some of them later claimed to have been forced to join the revolt by the rebels. Clergy also formed part of the revolt; as well as the more prominent leaders, such as John Ball or John Wrawe, nearly 20 are mentioned in the records of the revolt in the south-east. Some were pursuing local grievances, some were disadvantaged and suffering relative poverty, and others appear to have been motivated by strong radical beliefs.|$|E
5|$|A {{river is}} a natural watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>cases,</b> a river simply flows into the ground or dries up {{completely}} before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a river {{is said to be}} larger than a creek, but this is not always the case, due to vagueness in the language. A river is part of the hydrological cycle. Water within a river is generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).|$|E
5|$|Battles {{play out}} using a turn-based system where each unit {{on both sides}} is given their chance to move and act. Characters move and attack within the same turn, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>cases</b> units can take two moves in a turn. A key part of combat is the Weapons Triangle, a new {{addition}} which governs the opposing {{strengths and weaknesses of}} weapon types based on a rock–paper–scissors system - lances are stronger than swords, swords are stronger than axes, and axes are stronger than lances. A secondary system governs the magic system, where Fire, Lightning, and Wind spells have varying strengths and weaknesses against each other. Each unit has a character class which determines their weapon, skill set, movement and attack range, how much effect they have on other units, which latent skills they possess, and whether they use passive or aggressive skills when in combat. Different weapon types also affect character movement and battle performance: for instance, a powerful sword deals damage while slowing a character's movement.|$|E

50|$|Smoking {{cannabis}} {{has been}} linked to adverse respiratory effects including: chronic coughing, wheezing, sputum production, and acute bronchitis. It has been suggested that the common practice of inhaling cannabis smoke deeply and holding breath could lead to pneumothorax. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>case</b> reports involving immunocompromised patients, pulmonary infections such as aspergillosis have been attributed to smoking cannabis contaminated with fungi. The transmission of tuberculosis {{has been linked}} to cannabis inhalation techniques, such as sharing water pipes and 'Hotboxing'.|$|R
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the Paleozoic, around 400 Mya, the brachiopods were among the most {{abundant}} filter feeders in the ocean, and over 12,000 fossil species are recognized. By the PermianTriassic extinction event 250 Mya, bivalves were undergoing a huge radiation of diversity. The bivalves were hard hit by this event, but re-established themselves and thrived during the Triassic period that followed. In contrast, the brachiopods lost 95% of their species diversity. The ability of some bivalves to burrow and thus avoid predators may have been a major factor in their success. Other new adaptations within various families allowed species to occupy previously unused evolutionary niches. These included increasing relative buoyancy in soft sediments by developing spines on the shell, gaining the ability to swim, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>cases,</b> adopting predatory habits.|$|E
5|$|For {{decades after}} the {{discovery}} of GRBs, astronomers searched for a counterpart at other wavelengths: i.e., any astronomical object in positional coincidence with a recently observed burst. Astronomers considered many distinct classes of objects, including white dwarfs, pulsars, supernovae, globular clusters, quasars, Seyfert galaxies, and BL Lac objects. All such searches were unsuccessful, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>cases</b> particularly well-localized bursts (those whose positions were determined with {{what was then a}} high degree of accuracy) could be clearly shown to have no bright objects of any nature consistent with the position derived from the detecting satellites. This suggested an origin of either very faint stars or extremely distant galaxies. Even the most accurate positions contained numerous faint stars and galaxies, and it was widely agreed that final resolution of the origins of cosmic gamma-ray bursts would require both new satellites and faster communication.|$|E
5|$|For the box set release, Quatermass and the Pit was {{extensively}} restored. A {{process called}} VidFIRE {{was applied to}} all of the scenes originally broadcast live, restoring the fluid interlaced video look they would have had on transmission, but which was lost during the telerecording process. For the pre-filmed scenes, most of the high-quality original 35mm film inserts still existed, as they had been spliced into the 1959–60 compilation repeat version in place of the lower-quality telerecorded versions of the same sequences. As this compilation also survived in the BBC archives, these film sequences were able to be digitally remastered and inserted into the newly restored episodic version for the DVD release. The compilation used a separate magnetic soundtrack, and although the original had decayed a safety copy had survived. This yielded better sound quality than the optical soundtracks accompanying the original episodes, and was therefore the main source for the audio remastering except in the case of scenes that were not in the compilation, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>cases</b> where faults on the magnetic tracks necessitated their replacement by the optical versions.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, Wallace was {{drawn into the}} debate over {{mandatory}} smallpox vaccination. Wallace originally saw the issue {{as a matter of}} personal liberty; but, after studying some of the statistics provided by anti-vaccination activists, he began to question the efficacy of vaccination. At the time, the germ theory of disease was very new and far from universally accepted. Moreover, no one knew enough about the human immune system to understand why vaccination worked. When Wallace did some research, he discovered instances where supporters of vaccination had used questionable, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>cases</b> completely phony, statistics to support their arguments. Always suspicious of authority, Wallace suspected that physicians had a vested interest in promoting vaccination, and became convinced that reductions in the incidence of smallpox that had been attributed to vaccination were, in fact, due to better hygiene and improvements in public sanitation.|$|E
5|$|Many {{microbes}} {{have been}} proposed as triggers of MS, but none have been confirmed. Moving {{at an early age}} from one location in the world to another alters a person's subsequent risk of MS. An explanation for this could be that some kind of infection, produced by a widespread microbe rather than a rare one, is related to the disease. Proposed mechanisms include the hygiene hypothesis and the prevalence hypothesis. The hygiene hypothesis proposes that exposure to certain infectious agents early in life is protective, the disease being a response to a late encounter with such agents. The prevalence hypothesis proposes that the disease is due to an infectious agent more common in regions where MS is common and where in most individuals it causes an ongoing infection without symptoms. Only <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>cases</b> and after many years does it cause demyelination. The hygiene hypothesis has received more support than the prevalence hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Observations {{of females}} in {{southern}} Texas revealed that ovaries are developed by {{two years of}} age and the first birth takes place typically a year later, though <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>cases</b> females as young as one-and-a-half years may mate successfully. Females can breed again around a year after parturition. Males in the same location were found to have active testes by the age of three years, that matured considerably by the next year. Males become sexually active at four or five years. Mating may occur throughout the year, with peaks of three to four months. The time of the year when these peaks occur varies geographically. In Texas, a peak is apparent from December to March. In Bharatpur National Park (Rajasthan, India) the breeding season is from October to February, peaking in November and December. The Sariska reserve witnesses a similar peak in December and January.|$|E
