5|$|Although cheetahs and leopards {{preferentially}} prey {{on smaller}} animals than those hunted by spotted <b>hyenas,</b> <b>hyenas</b> will steal their kills {{when the opportunity}} presents itself. Cheetahs are usually easily intimidated by <b>hyenas,</b> and put up little resistance, while leopards, particularly males, may stand up to <b>hyenas.</b> There are records of some male leopards preying on <b>hyenas.</b> <b>Hyenas</b> are nonetheless dangerous opponents for leopards; {{there is at least}} one record of a young adult male leopard dying from a septicemia infection caused by wounds inflicted by a spotted hyena. There is also a case of two spotted <b>hyenas</b> killing and eating a young leopard in Timbavati Game Reserve, after a young hyena was killed by the leopard.|$|E
5|$|Spotted <b>hyenas</b> {{dominate}} other hyena species wherever their ranges overlap. Brown <b>hyenas</b> encounter spotted <b>hyenas</b> in the Kalahari, {{where the}} brown species outnumbers the spotted. The two species typically encounter {{each other on}} carcasses, which the larger spotted species usually appropriate. Sometimes, brown <b>hyenas</b> will stand their ground and raise their manes while emitting growls. This usually {{has the effect of}} seemingly confusing spotted <b>hyenas,</b> which will act bewildered, though they will occasionally attack and maul their smaller cousins. Similar interactions have been recorded between spotted and striped <b>hyenas</b> in the Serengeti.|$|E
5|$|A single {{spotted hyena}} can eat at least 14.5kg of meat per meal. Although spotted <b>hyenas</b> act aggressively {{toward each other}} when feeding, they {{compete with each other}} mostly through speed of eating, rather than by {{fighting}} as lions do. When feeding on an intact carcass, spotted <b>hyenas</b> will first consume the meat around the loins and anal region, then open the abdominal cavity and pull out the soft organs. Once the stomach, its wall and contents are consumed, the <b>hyenas</b> will eat the lungs and abdominal and leg muscles. Once the muscles have been eaten, the carcass is disassembled and the <b>hyenas</b> carry off pieces to eat in peace. Spotted <b>hyenas</b> are adept at eating their prey in water: they have been observed to dive under floating carcasses to take bites, then resurface to swallow. A single hyena can take less than two minutes in eating a gazelle fawn, while a group of 35 <b>hyenas</b> can completely consume an adult zebra in 36 minutes. Spotted <b>hyenas</b> do not require much water, and typically only spend 30 seconds drinking.|$|E
50|$|Hyaena is a genus {{comprising}} two of {{the living}} species of hyenas: the striped <b>hyena</b> (Hyaena hyaena) from western Asia and northern Africa and the brown <b>hyena</b> (Hyaena brunnea) from southern Africa. The brown <b>hyena</b> has sometimes been placed in a separate genus Parahyaena, or even included in the otherwise fossil genus Pachycrocuta, but recent sources have tended to place it in Hyaena. The brown <b>hyena's</b> skull is larger {{than that of the}} striped <b>hyena.</b> The male brown <b>hyena</b> is slightly larger than the female, while the sexes of the striped <b>hyena</b> are equally sized. Both species are smaller than the spotted <b>hyena,</b> but larger than the aardwolf. They are predominantly scavengers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hyena</b> chase (or <b>Hyena</b> game, or <b>Hyena)</b> is {{a simple}} race game {{originating}} in North Africa. It features a spiral track, and players race their pieces along the spiral from the outside to the centre and back. The first player to finish wins the <b>hyena,</b> which also travels along the spiral. On the return journey to the outside, the <b>hyena</b> eats any of the players it passes.|$|R

5|$|Black-backed and side-striped jackals, and African golden wolves {{will feed}} {{alongside}} <b>hyenas,</b> though {{they will be}} chased if they approach too closely. Spotted <b>hyenas</b> will sometimes follow jackals and wolves during the gazelle fawning season, as jackals and wolves are effective at tracking and catching young animals. <b>Hyenas</b> do not take to eating wolf flesh readily; four <b>hyenas</b> were reported to take half an hour in eating a golden wolf. Overall, the two animals typically ignore each other {{when there is no}} food or young at stake.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} <b>hyenas,</b> the spotted hyena shows a greater {{relative}} amount of frontal cortex which {{is involved in}} the mediation of social behavior. Studies strongly suggest convergent evolution in spotted hyena and primate intelligence. A study done by evolutionary anthropologists demonstrated that spotted <b>hyenas</b> outperform chimpanzees on cooperative problem-solving tests; captive pairs of spotted <b>hyenas</b> were challenged to tug two ropes in unison to earn a food reward, successfully cooperating and learning the maneuvers quickly without prior training. Experienced <b>hyenas</b> even helped inexperienced clan-mates to solve the problem. In contrast, chimps and other primates often require extensive training, and cooperation between individuals is not always as easy for them. The intelligence of the spotted hyena was attested to by Dutch colonists in 19th-century South Africa, who noted that <b>hyenas</b> were exceedingly cunning and suspicious, particularly after successfully escaping from traps. Spotted <b>hyenas</b> seem to plan on hunting specific species in advance; <b>hyenas</b> have been observed to indulge in activities such as scent marking before setting off to hunt zebras, a behaviour which does not occur when they target other prey species. Also, spotted <b>hyenas</b> have been recorded to utilise deceptive behaviour, including giving alarm calls during feeding when no enemies are present, thus frightening off other <b>hyenas</b> and allowing them to temporarily eat in peace. Similarly, mothers will emit alarm calls in attempting to interrupt attacks on their cubs by other <b>hyenas.</b>|$|E
5|$|Red foxes may {{compete with}} striped <b>hyenas</b> on large carcasses. Red foxes may {{give way to}} <b>hyenas</b> on unopened carcasses, as the latter's {{stronger}} jaws can easily tear open flesh that is too tough for foxes. Foxes may harass <b>hyenas,</b> using their smaller size and greater speed to avoid the hyena's attacks. Sometimes, foxes seem to deliberately torment <b>hyenas</b> even {{when there is no}} food at stake. Some foxes may mistime their attacks, and are killed. Fox remains are often found in hyena dens, and <b>hyenas</b> may steal foxes from traps.|$|E

5|$|Spotted <b>hyenas</b> {{have also}} been found to catch fish, tortoises, humans, black rhino, hippo calves, young African elephants, {{pangolins}} and pythons. There {{is at least one}} record of four <b>hyenas</b> killing an adult or subadult hippopotamus in Kruger National Park. The fossil record indicates that the now extinct European spotted <b>hyenas</b> primarily fed on Przewalski's horses, Irish elk, reindeer, red deer, roe deer, fallow deer, wild boar, ibex, steppe wisent, aurochs, and woolly rhinoceros. Spotted <b>hyenas</b> are thought to be responsible for the dis-articulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons. Such large carcasses were an optimal food resource for <b>hyenas,</b> especially at the end of winter, when food was scarce. Spotted <b>hyenas</b> may consume leather articles such as boots and belts around campsites. Jane Goodall recorded spotted <b>hyenas</b> attacking or savagely playing with the exterior and interior fittings of cars, and the species is thought to be responsible for eating car tyres.|$|E
5|$|Spotted <b>hyenas</b> usually keep a safe {{distance}} from Nile crocodiles. Though they readily take to water to catch and store prey, <b>hyenas</b> will avoid crocodile-infested waters.|$|E
5|$|Spotted <b>hyenas</b> {{will follow}} packs of African wild dogs {{in order to}} {{appropriate}} their kills. They will typically inspect areas where wild dogs have rested and eat any food remains they find. When approaching wild dogs at a kill, solitary <b>hyenas</b> will approach cautiously and attempt to take off {{with a piece of}} meat unnoticed, though they may be mobbed by the dogs in the attempt. When operating in groups, spotted <b>hyenas</b> are more successful in pirating dog kills, though the dog's greater tendency to assist each other puts them at an advantage against spotted <b>hyenas,</b> who rarely work in unison. Cases of dogs scavenging from spotted <b>hyenas</b> are rare. Although wild dog packs can easily repel solitary <b>hyenas,</b> on the whole, {{the relationship between the two}} species is a one sided benefit for the <b>hyenas,</b> with wild dog densities being negatively correlated with high hyena populations.|$|E
5|$|Traditional Western {{beliefs about}} the spotted <b>hyena</b> {{can be traced back}} to Aristotle's Historia Animalium, which {{described}} the species as a necrophagous, cowardly and potentially dangerous animal. He further described how the <b>hyena</b> uses retching noises to attract dogs. In On the Generation of Animals, Aristotle criticised the erroneous belief that the spotted <b>hyena</b> is a hermaphrodite (which likely originated from the confusion caused by the masculinised genitalia of the female), though his physical descriptions are more consistent with the striped <b>hyena.</b> Pliny the Elder supported Aristotle's depiction, though he further elaborated that the <b>hyena</b> can imitate human voices. Additionally, he wrote how the <b>hyena</b> was held in high regard among the Magi, and that <b>hyena</b> body parts could cure different diseases, give protection and stimulate sexual desire in people.|$|R

5|$|Where spotted <b>hyenas</b> and lions {{occupy the}} same {{geographic}} area, {{the two species}} occupy the same ecological niche, and are thus in direct competition with one another. In some cases, the extent of dietary overlap can {{be as high as}} 68.8%. Lions typically ignore spotted <b>hyenas,</b> unless they are on a kill or are being harassed by them. There exists a common misconception that <b>hyenas</b> steal kills from lions, but most often it is the other way around. Lions will readily steal the kills of spotted hyenas; in the Ngorongoro Crater, it is common for lions to subsist largely on kills stolen from <b>hyenas.</b> Lions are quick to follow the calls of <b>hyenas</b> feeding, a fact demonstrated by field experiments, during which lions repeatedly approached whenever the tape-recorded calls of <b>hyenas</b> feeding were played. When confronted on a kill by lions, spotted <b>hyenas</b> will either leave or wait patiently at a distance of 30–100 metres until the lions have finished eating. In some cases, spotted <b>hyenas</b> are bold enough to feed alongside lions, and may occasionally force lions off a kill. This mostly occurs during the nighttime, when <b>hyenas</b> are bolder. Spotted <b>hyenas</b> usually prevail against groups of lionesses unaccompanied by males if they outnumber them 4:1. In some instances they were seen to have taken on and routed two pride males while outnumbering them 5:1. The two species may act aggressively toward one another even when there is no food at stake. Lions may charge at <b>hyenas</b> and maul them for no apparent reason; one male lion was filmed killing two <b>hyenas</b> on separate occasions without eating them, and lion predation can account for up to 71% of hyena deaths in Etosha. Spotted <b>hyenas</b> have adapted to this pressure by frequently mobbing lions which enter their territories. Experiments on captive spotted <b>hyenas</b> revealed that specimens with no prior experience with lions act indifferently to the sight of them, but will react fearfully to the scent.|$|E
5|$|Wolves may {{encounter}} striped <b>hyenas</b> in Israel, Central Asia and India, usually in disputes over carcasses. Striped <b>hyenas</b> feed extensively on wolf-killed carcasses {{in areas where}} the two species interact. One-to-one, <b>hyenas</b> dominate wolves, and may prey on them, but wolf packs can drive off single or outnumbered <b>hyenas.</b> However, there was a case of a female striped hyena dominating 12 Arabian wolves. Two cases are known however from southern Israel, where wolves and striped <b>hyenas</b> associated closely with each other in an apparently amicable way.|$|E
5|$|Although {{attacks against}} living humans are rare, the spotted hyena readily feeds on human corpses. In the {{tradition}} of the Maasai and the Hadza, corpses are left in the open for spotted <b>hyenas</b> to eat. A corpse rejected by <b>hyenas</b> is seen as having something wrong with it, and liable to cause social disgrace, therefore {{it is not uncommon for}} bodies to be covered in fat and blood from a slaughtered ox. In Ethiopia, <b>hyenas</b> were reported to feed extensively on the corpses of victims of the 1960 attempted coup and the Red Terror. <b>Hyenas</b> habituated to scavenging on human corpses may develop bold behaviours towards living people; hyena attacks on people in southern Sudan increased during the Second Sudanese Civil War, when human corpses were readily available to them.|$|E

5|$|In Africa, {{the spotted}} hyena is usually portrayed as an {{abnormal}} and ambivalent animal, {{considered to be}} sly, brutish, necrophagous and dangerous. It further embodies physical power, excessivity, ugliness, stupidity, as well as sacredness. Spotted <b>hyenas</b> vary in their folkloric and mythological depictions, depending on the ethnic group from which the tales originate. It {{is often difficult to}} know whether or not spotted <b>hyenas</b> are the specific hyena species featured in such stories, particularly in West Africa, as both spotted and striped <b>hyenas</b> are often given the same names. In west African tales, spotted <b>hyenas</b> symbolise immorality, dirty habits, the reversal of normal activities, and other negative traits, and are sometimes depicted as bad Muslims who challenge the local animism that exists among the Beng in Côte d’Ivoire. In East Africa, Tabwa mythology portrays the spotted hyena as a solar animal that first brought the sun to warm the cold earth.|$|E
5|$|Nathan Lane {{originally}} {{auditioned for}} Zazu, and Ernie Sabella, {{for one of}} the <b>hyenas.</b> Upon meeting each other at the recording studio, the actors, who at the time both co-starred in Guys and Dolls, were asked to record together as <b>hyenas.</b> The directors laughed at their performance and decided to cast them as Timon and Pumbaa. For the <b>hyenas,</b> the original intention was to reunite Cheech & Chong, but while Cheech Marin accepted to play Banzai, Tommy Chong was unavailable. Thus his role was changed into a female hyena, Shenzi, who was voiced by Whoopi Goldberg.|$|E
5|$|Natural {{historians of}} the 18th and 19th centuries {{rejected}} stories of hermaphroditism in <b>hyenas,</b> and recognised {{the differences between}} the spotted and striped hyena. However, they continued to focus on the species' scavenging habits, their potential to rob graves and their perceived cowardice. During the 20th century, Western and African stereotypes of the spotted hyena converged; in both Ernest Hemingway's Green Hills of Africa and Disney's The Lion King, the traits of gluttony and comical stupidity, common in African depictions of <b>hyenas,</b> are added to the Western perception of <b>hyenas</b> being cowardly and ugly. After the release of The Lion King, hyena biologists protested against the animal's portrayal: one hyena researcher sued Disney studios for defamation of character, and another who had organized the animators' visit to the University of California's Field Station for Behavioural Research, where they would observe and sketch captive <b>hyenas</b> suggested boycotting the film.|$|E
40|$|Two {{wetlands}} (<b>Hyena</b> and Nalogomon) in the Nairobi National Park {{were investigated}} by comparing plant composition {{in and around}} their immediate vicinity.

The terrestrial vegetation surrounding <b>Hyena</b> wetland dominated by while that of surrounding Nalogomon wetland was the grass Hyparrhemia rufa. It was also noted that <b>Hyena</b> Dam waters were colonized by aquatic weeds, namely Gunnera perpensa, Enhydra fluctuans and Ludwigia abyssinica, that were absent in Nalogomon wetland waters. This could {{have been due to}} eutrophication of the waters of <b>Hyena</b> Dam as it originated from human settlements (city estates) outside the park boundary...|$|R

5|$|Spotted <b>hyenas</b> may {{contract}} brucellosis, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. They {{are vulnerable}} to Trypanosoma congolense, which is contracted by consuming already infected herbivores, rather than through direct infection from tsetse flies. It is known that adult spotted <b>hyenas</b> in the Serengeti have antibodies against rabies, canine herpes, canine brucella, canine parvovirus, feline calici, leptospirosis, bovine brucella, rinderpest and anaplasmosis. During the canine distemper outbreak of 1993–94, molecular studies indicated that the viruses isolated from <b>hyenas</b> and lions were {{more closely related to}} each other than to the closest canine distemper virus in dogs. Evidence of canine distemper in spotted <b>hyenas</b> has also been recorded in the Masai Mara. Exposure to rabies does not cause clinical symptoms or affect individual survival or longevity. Analyses of several hyena saliva samples showed that the species is unlikely to be a rabies vector, thus indicating that the species catches the disease from other animals rather than from intraspecifics. The microfilaria of Dipetalonema dracuneuloides have been recorded in spotted <b>hyenas</b> in northern Kenya. The species is known to carry at least three cestode species of the genus Taenia, none of which are harmful to humans. It also carries protozoan parasites of the genus Hepatozoon in the Serengeti, Kenya and South Africa. Spotted <b>hyenas</b> may act as hosts in the life-cycles of various parasites which start life in herbivores; Taenia hyaenae and T. olnogojinae occur in <b>hyenas</b> in their adult phase. Trichinella spiralis are found as cysts in hyena muscles.|$|E

Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the <b>hyenas</b> while Scar, {{attempting}} to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock.

5|$|Both Björn Kurtén and Camille Arambourg {{promoted}} an Asiatic origin for the species; Kurtén focussed {{his arguments}} on the Plio-Pleistocene taxon Crocuta sivalensis from the Siwaliks, a view defended by Arambourg, who nonetheless allowed {{the possibility of}} an Indo-Ethiopian origin. This stance was contested by Ficarelli and Torre, who referred to evidence of the spotted hyena's presence from African deposists dating from the early Pleistocene, a similar age to the Asian C. sivalensis. Studies on the phylogeographic distribution of mtDNA haplotypes indicates three migration events from Africa to Eurasia, though neither the topology of the phylogenetic tree or the fossil record exclude {{the possibility of an}} Asian origin. The earliest migration of spotted <b>hyenas</b> from Africa to Eurasia began less than 3.5 million years ago, most probably from the area where the first spotted hyena fossils were discovered, reaching East Asia and most likely also Pakistan. The second migration of spotted <b>hyenas</b> occurred less than 1.3–1.5 million years ago and resulted in the first arrival of <b>hyenas</b> in Europe and a separation of African spotted <b>hyenas</b> into a southern and a northern population. The third spotted hyena migration took place 0.36 million years ago, starting from the northern African population and reaching both Europe and Asia. Unlike other African carnivores, {{with the exception of the}} leopard, there is no evidence to suggest that spotted <b>hyenas</b> underwent a genetic bottleneck during the Pleistocene.|$|E
2500|$|The striped <b>hyena</b> may dig its own dens, {{but it also}} {{establishes}} its lairs in caves, rock fissures, erosion {{channels and}} burrows formerly occupied by porcupines, wolves, warthogs and aardvarks. <b>Hyena</b> dens can be identified {{by the presence of}} bones at their entrances. The striped <b>hyena</b> hides in caves, niches, pits, dense thickets, reeds and plume grass during the day to shelter from predators, heat or winter cold. The size and elaboration of striped <b>hyena</b> dens varies according to location dens in the Karakum have entrances 0.67–0.72 m wide and are extended over a distance of 4.15–5 m, with no lateral extensions or special chambers.
