40|$|This essay aims {{to examine}} the {{discourse}} that conceptualizes the educational exchange and the European culture {{within the framework of}} a theory of European identity construction. Then, I shall discuss the main positions of this discourse, their concern with the global market and their indifference about political and material inequalities. The following question is posed: which are the innovative proposals that could set in course an ideal of a unified, just and radical Europe? A first approach to it is provided by Habermas' and Derrida's recent publications. Their views constitute the starting point of my intervention in the debate on the educational future of Europe and the inculcation of a European identity in students' consciousness. But my response to the above question challenges the kind of European philosophical discourse that does not rethink the main objectives of the social and political elites of Europe. I suggest that we criticize the dominant position of those elites and that we promote an alternative normativity of equality and justice. In the absence of such a normative condition, the bad side of modernity may continue to prevail and serve the material and symbolic interests of the privileged <b>European</b> <b>classes...</b>|$|E
40|$|Lake Tovel is a LTER {{research}} site (IT 09 - 005 -A) {{within the larger}} Mountain Lakes parent site (IT- 009 - 000 -A). It {{is also part of}} NETLAKE (EU Cost Action ES 1201) that aims to build a network of sites and individuals to support the development and deployment of sensor-based systems in lakes, and promote their use to address water issues in Europe. Longterm ecological datasets collected in a consistent way over time offer the opportunity to study the response of an ecosystem to environmental stressors. Mountain lakes, because of their sensitivity to environmental changes, can be used as early warning systems for climate change and are ideal study sites to investigate ecological processes at the whole-ecosystem level. Furthermore, their phytoplankton communities are frequently made up of difficult to identify small flagellates, often limiting the taxonomic resolution achieved. Despite the strategic importance of our environment, citizens often have a poor understanding of environmental issues, even though they make the management decisions that will affect ecosystems. Lake Tovel provided the ideal setting for addressing these different topics-phytoplankton taxonomy and citizens 2 ̆ 7 education. NETLAKE supported a Short-Term Scientific Mission for a trained phycologist who provided a more refined taxonomic definition of Tovel phytoplankton, thereby strengthening the basis for future studies on phytoplankton communities. A further objective of NETLAKE was to raise citizen awareness of local lakes and build a network of LakePals within Europe. These objectives were achieved by increasing lake visibility to the public by setting up a dedicated website and positioning a webcam, donated by the local bank Cassa Rurale Tuenno. In addition, the local middle school, along with other <b>European</b> <b>classes,</b> participated in the WaterPals initiative geared to inform children about their environmental heritage regarding Lake Tovel. This is particularly important because these children will be the decision makers of tomorrow...|$|E
40|$|The {{reproductive}} performance of cattle {{may be influenced}} by several factors, but mineral imbalances are crucial in terms of direct effects on reproduction. Several studies have shown that elements such as calcium, copper, iron, magnesium, selenium, and zinc are essential for reproduction and can prevent oxidative stress. However, toxic elements such as lead, nickel, and arsenic can have adverse effects on reproduction. In this paper, we applied a simple and fast method of multi-element analysis to bovine semen samples from Zebu and <b>European</b> <b>classes</b> used in reproduction programs and artificial insemination. Samples were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma spectrometry (ICP-MS) using aqueous medium calibration and the samples were diluted in a proportion of 1 : 50 in a solution containing 0. 01 % (vol/vol) Triton X- 100 and 0. 5 % (vol/vol) nitric acid. Rhodium, iridium, and yttrium were used as the internal standards for ICP-MS analysis. To develop a reliable method of tracing the class of bovine semen, we used data mining techniques that make it possible to classify unknown samples after checking the differentiation of known-class samples. Based on the determination of 15 elements in 41 samples of bovine semen, 3 machine-learning tools for classification were applied to determine cattle class. Our results demonstrate the potential of support vector machine (SVM), multilayer perceptron (MLP), and random forest (RF) chemometric tools to identify cattle class. Moreover, the selection tools made it possible {{to reduce the number of}} chemical elements needed from 15 to just 8.

40|$|Este estudo sobre os primeiros anos de atividades da Sociedade das Casas de Asilo da Infância Desvalida firmou-se na exploração do arquivo da instituição, denominada desde há poucos anos Fundação D. Pedro IV. Ela orientou-se pela filantropia, seguindo as tendências manifestadas pelas classes hegemônicas européias, sobretudo em França, tendo à sua frente o ex-Imperador do Brasil, que regressou a Lisboa após a derrota dos absolutistas. As Casas de Asilo tinham uma fisionomia própria que se distinguia das salles d'asile. No intuito de acharem um rumo ajustado às necessidades da sociedade portuguesa, os animadores da iniciativa começaram por criar uma "escola de ensino". Colhidos os primeiros frutos da experiência, o movimento das Casas de Asilo começou a difundir-se pelo país e a diversificar as suas intervenções. Embora destinadas a um público de crianças provenientes de famílias muito pobres ou indigentes, em idade pré-escolar, essas instituições configuravam as escolas de Primeiras Letras, mas incluíam no currículo atividades educativas, manuais ou artísticas, e de educação social, visando à integração de seu público. Apesar disso, essa experiência de educação infantil não logrou desprender-se da tradição escolarizante que a marcava. This {{study on}} {{the first years of}} {{activity}} of the Society of Homes for Disabled Children bases itself in the exploration of the archives of the institution, recently renamed the Foundation D.

It was oriented by philanthropy, following the tendencies manifested by the hegemonic <b>European</b> <b>classes</b> especially in France and headed by the ex-Emperor of Brazil who had returned to Lisbon after the defeat of the Absolutists. The Homes for Disabled Children had their own physiognomy, different from the salles d'asile. Aiming to set a course consonant with the needs of Portuguese society, the promoters of the initiative started by creating a "school for teaching". Harvesting the first fruits of the experience, the Homes for Disabled Children movement began to spread throughout the country and diversify its interventions. Although intended for children of pre school age from poor or indigent families, these institutions became schools for learning first literacy, they also included manual and artistic educational activities in their curriculum as well as social education aimed at integrating their public. Despite this, the experience of early childhood education did not manage to disengage from the teaching tradition that characterized it...|$|E
