40|$|The {{importance}} of distinguishing between direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>losses</b> of disasters is stressed.

For {{the case of the}} Great Hanshin-Awaji (Kobe) Earthquake of 1995, direct stock losses of both the manufacturing and the commercial sectors record almost same size of big damage. As for <b>indirect</b> flow <b>losses,</b> the commercial and the other services sectors show far greater damage than the manufacturing sector. A careful statistical analysis of <b>indirect</b> <b>losses</b> using the gross regional product in the stricken area presents a new finding that the lost product and income in terms of estimated <b>indirect</b> <b>losses</b> are quite large and continue to arise for longer than 10 years, mounting to some 14 trillion yen (about US$ 0. 13 trillion).

40|$|This paper explores {{sovereign}} risk preferences against direct and <b>indirect</b> natural disasters <b>losses</b> in industrialized countries. Using Australia {{as a case}} study, the analysis compares expected disaster losses and government capacity to finance losses. Utilizing a national disaster loss dataset, extreme value theory is applied to estimate an all-hazard annual loss distribution. Unusually but critically, the dataset includes direct as well as <b>indirect</b> <b>losses,</b> allowing for the analysis to consider the oft-ignored issue of <b>indirect</b> <b>losses.</b> Expected annual losses (direct, and direct plus indirect) are overlaid with a risk-layer approach, to distinguish low, medium and extreme loss events. Each risk layer is compared to available fiscal resources for financing losses, grounded in the political reality of Australian disaster financing. When considering direct losses only, we find support for a risk-neutral preference {{on the part of}} the Australian government for low and medium loss levels, and a risk-averse preference in regard to extreme <b>losses.</b> When <b>indirect</b> <b>losses</b> are also estimated, we find that even medium loss levels are expected to overwhelm available fiscal resources, thereby violating the available resources assumption underlying arguments for {{sovereign risk}} neutrality. Our analysis provides empirical support for the assertion that <b>indirect</b> <b>losses</b> are a major, under-recognised concern for industrialized countries. A risk-averse preference in regard to medium and extreme loss events recommends enhanced investment in both corrective and prospective risk reduction in relation to these risks level, in particular to reduce <b>indirect</b> <b>losses...</b>|$|R

In this paper a conceptual indicator framework is presented which allows to assess the indirect vulnerability of industrial sectors to different types of disasters in a quantitative manner. The results are useful for information sharing and decision making in crisis management and emergency planning (mitigation measures, business continuity planning), since the developed indicator system helps to take the complex phenomenon of industrial vulnerability and the underlying interdependencies into account.

Jerry Nickelsburg, an economics professor at UCLA Anderson School of Management, presented UCLA Anderson Forecast's economic report. He stated that so far, the strike has not affected the economy deeply, citing the network's inventory stockpiling in preparation of the strike and the increase in usage of reality shows. Ultimately, the Forecast predicted an economic impact of $380 million if the strike were to last 22 weeks, which was how long the 1988 strike had lasted.

50|$|In other words, the court's {{main task}} is to do justice as between these parties in their present situation. For this purpose, a {{weighing}} evaluative process is required, rather than a clear-cut rule of law. For example, in Meah v McCreamer and others (No. 2) (1986) 1 AER 943, the claimant suffered head injuries and brain damage {{as a result of}} the defendant's negligent driving, which led to a personality disorder. Four years later, he sexually assaulted and raped three women. The illegal nature of his conduct was not raised at the civil trial, and the claimant was held entitled to damages to compensate him for being imprisoned following his conviction. In separate proceedings, the three women assaulted obtained a judgment for compensation, so he sought indemnification from the negligent driver and his insurers for the amounts he had been ordered to pay. This was not a claim for his own personal injuries nor direct financial loss, but <b>indirect</b> <b>loss.</b> The three women could not have sued the driver directly because they were not foreseeable and so no duty of care was owed to them. The question was whether a person convicted of a crime was entitled to be indemnified against the consequences of that crime. Woolf J. held that the action would be dismissed on two grounds. First, the damages were too remote to be recoverable and, if such actions were to be allowed, it would leave insurers open to indefinite liability for an indefinite duration. Secondly, as a matter of policy, defendants should not have a right to be indemnified against the consequences of their crimes. In Clunis v Camden and Islington Health Authority (1998) QB 978 the claimant had been discharged from hospital where he had been detained under s3 Mental Health Act 1983. He was to receive aftercare services in the community under s117 Act 1983, but his mental condition deteriorated and, two months later, he fatally stabbed a stranger at a London Underground station. He pleaded guilty to manslaughter on the ground of diminished responsibility and was ordered to be detained in a secure hospital. Subsequently, he brought an action against his local health authority for negligence. The health authority applied to strike out the claim as disclosing no cause of action on two grounds. First, that the claim arose out of the health authority's statutory obligations under s117 Act 1983 and those obligations did not give rise to a common law duty of care. Secondly, that the claim was based on the plaintiff's own criminal act. In the Court of Appeal, the health authority's appeal was allowed on both grounds.|$|E

40|$|Frequent {{packet loss}} of media data is a {{critical}} problem that degrades the quality of streaming services over mobile networks. Packet loss invalidates frames containing lost packets and other related frames at the same time. <b>Indirect</b> <b>loss</b> caused by losing packets decreases the quality of streaming. A scalable streaming service can decrease the amount of dropped multimedia resulting from a single packet loss. Content providers typically divide one large media stream into several layers through a scalable streaming service and then provide each scalable layer to the user depending on the mobile network. Also, a scalable streaming service {{makes it possible to}} decode partial multimedia data depending on the relationship between frames and layers. Therefore, a scalable streaming service provides a way to decrease the wasted multimedia data when one packet is lost. However, the hierarchical structure between frames and layers of scalable streams determines the service quality of the scalable streaming service. Even if whole packets of layers are transmitted successfully, they cannot be decoded {{as a result of the}} absence of reference frames and layers. Therefore, the complicated relationship between frames and layers in a scalable stream increases the volume of abandoned layers. For providing a high-quality scalable streaming service, we choose a proper relationship between scalable layers as well as the amount of transmitted multimedia data depending on the network situation. We prove that a simple scalable scheme outperforms a complicated scheme in an error-prone network. We suggest an adaptive set-top box (AdaptiveSTB) to lower the dependency between scalable layers in a scalable stream. Also, we provide a numerical model to obtain the <b>indirect</b> <b>loss</b> of multimedia data and apply it to various multimedia streams.

This paper explores the conditions under which the <b>indirect</b> coupling <b>loss</b> factors are zero, so that the system is described by a "proper-SEA" model. It also investigates the dependence of the direct and <b>indirect</b> coupling <b>loss</b> factors on the modal properties of the system and on the modal overlap.

It is seen that in the low modal overlap limit the coupling loss factors are proportional to the damping loss factor and equipartition of energy only occurs if all modes are global. For higher modal overlap the SEA parameters depend on the detailed statistics of the modes and the situation is complicated. However, if all the modes are local the <b>indirect</b> coupling <b>loss</b> factors are all zero. In the high modal overlap limit the coupling loss factors asymptote to constants, with <b>indirect</b> coupling <b>loss</b> factors becoming zero.
