50|$|Shortly thereafter, {{it became}} a monastery. Two houses with cells were built for nuns brought from Socola Monastery. Soon, Prince Alexander Mourousis moved the nuns to Agapia Monastery, and the cells were left {{in the hands of}} that establishment, as well as Văratec Monastery. It was during its {{affiliation}} with the nuns that the present name was bestowed. Aside from living quarters, the nuns used the cells to teach pupils and to host students and visitors. In 1819, the church was again rebuilt by postelnic Mihail Pascu. Following earthquakes, as well as bombings during World War II, the building was seriously deteriorated, so that exterior repairs were carried out in 1959. A new support pole for the spire cross was installed and <b>interior</b> <b>varnishing</b> was done in 1966.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} two {{substrates}} – luminium and plywood – n {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC) emissions from an <b>interior</b> finishing <b>varnish</b> were investigated using a dynamic environmental chamber. The VOCs concentrations were analyzed by a gas chromatography/mass selective detector (GC/MSD). The concentrations of VOCs were monitored for the first 10 h. The concentrations generally increased to their maximum values within 1 h and then decreased as the emission rate declined. Four major VOCs, toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene and o-xylene, were identified in the varnish emissions. The highest VOC concentrations were found on painted aluminium substrate while the lowest {{were found on the}} painted plywood substrate. First-order decay and double-exponential models were used to evaluate the characteristics of the emissions. The present work confirmed that the substrate had a marked influence on the VOC concentrations and emissions from an <b>interior</b> finishing <b>varnish...</b>|$|R
50|$|Water-based {{paint is}} far easier and cheaper to apply, as undercoat, {{to produce a}} good smooth finish with a {{fraction}} of the time and effort of enamel paints, but harder and slower-drying enamel is best for the top coat {{on the outside of the}} hull, which is subject to a lot of bumps and scraps. Limit varnishing to smaller areas, such as grab rails, hatches, toe rails and trim, unless you have lots of patience and a very dust-free environment for varnishing. Use only marine gloss varnish on the outside, as <b>interior</b> <b>varnish</b> will peel off very quickly in hot sun and rain. Marine varnish has UV inhibitors to slow down peeling and fading. Never varnish a deck as it is slippery when wet. Even top-quality marine varnish is not as water-resistant as paint, so you must apply at least 4 coats. Often perfectionists will apply 8 coats or more to get a glass-like, reflective finish. Never varnish submerged parts like rudders.|$|R

40|$|This {{study has}} been {{performed}} for determining the impacts of impregnation with Timbercare Aqua (TA) to surface roughness of some varnishes. For analysis, measurements were performed in the vertical direction of fibers by using Mitutoya Surftest- 301 stylus scanner device. Roughness values were determined with ± 0. 01 μm sensitivity where scanning length (lt) was 12 mm and sampling length was (λc) 2. 5 mm according to TS 971 and ISO 4288 standards. As a result, Surface roughness (Ra) mean value was measured as highest in oak (3. 359 μm), in waterborne <b>interior</b> space <b>varnish</b> (2. 465 μm) and TA and one layer application (3. 320 μm). For the combination of wood, type of varnish and impregnation process, surface smoothness was lowest in combination of Scotch pine and polyurethane varnish and one layer impregnation (0. 433 μm) and highest in combination oak and <b>interior</b> space <b>varnish</b> and one layer impregnation with TA (6. 502 μm). Ra was measured highest on the surfaces impregnated with TA. So, {{it can be said}} that TA has an increasing effect on the surface roughness of woods...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} four substrates-an {{aluminium}} board, a plasterboard, a gypsum board and a plywood board-on {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC) emissions from an <b>interior</b> finishing <b>varnish</b> were investigated using a dynamic environmental chamber. Four major VOCs, including toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene and o-xylene, were identified in the varnish emissions. The average amount of VOCs emitted from the painted aluminium substrate was approximately 65 % more than that from the painted plywood substrate during the 10 h test period. The results indicated that most VOC emissions from the painted aluminium substrate occurred in the early stage through an evaporation-like processes. However, {{the majority of the}} VOC from the plywood substrate was emitted in a later stage through a diffusion-like process.

50|$|The {{interior}} of the town house's main block consists of a single large chamber, with doors at the east end leading to the toilets and vault. The <b>interior</b> finish is <b>varnished</b> pine {{on the walls and}} ceiling, and fir flooring. The wall finish is vertically laid wainscoting below the windows, and horizontal above the chair rail. A simple, low rail-and-style fence separates a holding area for voting booths, and there is a raised platform for the selectmen's table near the doorway to the vault. The building was electrified in 1937, retaining its original fixtures, and the vault was provided in 1935 by the Herring-Hall-Marvin Safe Company of Cincinnati, Ohio.|$|R
50|$|The H-class {{cars were}} {{progressively}} updated during the 1970s, {{again in the}} late 1980s and most recently (on five trams) in 2000. These included toughened safety glass in windows, replacing wooden panels with fibreglass, upgrading bogies, fluorescent lights inside the cars, and sealed-beam headlights and brake/hazard lamp clusters outside. In 1986 the trams were converted from trolley pole to pantograph operation. Despite the various refurbishments and upgrades, the overall character of the H-class trams has stayed very much as they were built. The <b>interiors</b> are still <b>varnished</b> wood and glass etched with MTT logos, and with no heating or air conditioning. Any remaining services are crew operated, with a driver and conductor on single cars, or a driver and two conductors on two-car sets.|$|R
5000|$|Both {{the house}} and barn built by the Burgesses {{included}} recent innovations not found in many farms in rural Maine, because agriculture was generally in decline. The barn was a large structure with a gambrel roof, a western innovation that improved hay storage capacity, and the larger number of milking stations indicated that the farm was shifting to an increased emphasis in dairy production. The house was a two story frame foursquare structure, with a hip roof. A single-story hip-roofed porch, supported by Tuscan columns, spanned the front and wraps around to one side. The <b>interior</b> retained original <b>varnished</b> woodwork. An ell joined {{the house to the}} barn. [...] The entire complex was engulfed by an accidental fire, probably started by sparks in the barn, and destroyed in July 2013.|$|R
50|$|On 21 October 1896 The North Queensland Register {{reported}} that Daking-Smith's new residence, {{one of the}} finest in the town, was approaching completion. The position of the building, facing the corner, was apparently designed to secure an expansive outlook, while increasing privacy. The building's style, the bungalow, was seen as the most suitable for the local climate, and features mentioned at the time included: a handsome flight of front steps; a spacious verandah with cast iron railings; glass front and rear doors, both with sidelights; an arch in the hallway and one between the dining and drawing rooms; cedar cornices and an embossed stamped paper frieze in the dining and drawing rooms; two floor-to-ceiling bay windows to the front verandah; <b>varnished</b> <b>interior</b> woodwork; three large bedrooms in the main building; ventilation tubing from the ornamental panels in each ceiling, with an iron ventilator on the roof; and bedrooms {{on either side of the}} latticed back verandah, separated from the main building. There was also a separate pantry, on piles set in vessels of water, off the rear verandah; and the kitchen wing included the kitchen, a bathroom and three bedrooms (counting the bedroom on the south end of the rear verandah). The contractor for the residence was TB O'Meara, the architect was WHA Munro, and the plumber was Charles Fraser.|$|R
40|$|There {{has long}} been a debate as to whether rock varnish {{deposits}} are microbially mediated or are deposited by inorganic processes. Varnished rocks are found throughout the world primarily in arid and semi-arid regions. The varnish coats are typically up to 200 microns thick and are composed of clays and alternating layers enriched in manganese and iron oxides. The individual layers range in thickness from 1 micron to greater than 10 microns and may continue laterally for more than a 100 microns. Overlapping botryoidal structures are visible in thin section and scanning electron micrographs. The coatings also include small amounts of organic mater and detrital grains. Amino-acid hydrolysates offer a means of assessing the organic composition of rock varnish collected from the Sonoran Desert, near Phoenix, AZ. Chromatographic analyses of hydrolysates from powdered samples of rock varnish suggest that the <b>interior</b> of rock <b>varnish</b> is relatively enriched in amino acids and specifically in d-alanine and glutamic acid. Peptidoglycan (murein) is the main structural component of gram-positive bacterial cell walls. The d-enantiomer of alanine and glutamic acid are specific to peptidoglycan and are consequently an indicator for the presence of bacteria. D-alanine is also found in teichoic acid which is only found in gram-positive bacteria. Several researchers have cultured bacteria from the surface of rock varnish and most have been gram-positive, suggesting that gram-positive bacteria are intimately associated with varnish coatings and {{may play a role in}} the formation of varnish coatings...|$|R
5|$|By 1965, the six {{passenger}} cars of the DRR's Retlaw 1 train, {{due to their}} slow passenger loading and unloading times, began to be phased out of service. In July 1974, the Retlaw 1 {{passenger cars}} were retired and stored in the DRR's roundhouse, except for the Grand Canyon observation coach, which was converted into a parlor car and renamed Lilly Belle after Walt Disney's wife Lillian. The Lilly Belle was given a new exterior paint scheme and a new <b>interior,</b> which included <b>varnished</b> mahogany paneling, velour curtains and seats, a floral-patterned wool rug, and Disney family pictures framed and hung on the walls. The first official passenger to come aboard the Lilly Belle after its conversion into a parlor car in September 1975 was Japanese Emperor Hirohito, and since then it can be regularly seen coupled {{on the ends of}} the DRR's trains. In 1996, rail collector Bill Norred acquired the five other Retlaw 1 passenger cars. Norred died two years later, and in 1999 his family sold the four coaches of the former Retlaw 1 passenger train to Rob Rossi, owner of the Pacific Coast Railroad located within Santa Margarita Ranch in Santa Margarita, California, leaving only the Retlaw 1 combine car in the Norred family's possession. On July 10, 2010, the Norred family sold the Retlaw 1 combine car to the Carolwood Foundation, which restored it and put it on display next to Walt Disney's Carolwood Barn within the Los Angeles Live Steamers Railroad Museum complex in Los Angeles' Griffith Park.|$|R
