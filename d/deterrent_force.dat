5|$|STRAT-X, or Strategic-Experimental, was a U.S. government-sponsored study {{conducted}} during 1966 and 1967 that comprehensively analyzed the potential {{future of the}} U.S. nuclear <b>deterrent</b> <b>force.</b> At the time, the Soviet Union was making significant strides in nuclear weapons delivery, and also constructing anti-ballistic missile defenses to protect strategic facilities. To address a potential technological {{gap between the two}} superpowers, U.S. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara entrusted the classified STRAT-X study to the Institute for Defense Analyses, which compiled a twenty-volume report in nine months. The report looked into more than one hundred different weapons systems, ultimately resulting in the MGM-134 Midgetman and LGM-118 Peacekeeper intercontinental ballistic missiles, the s, and the Trident submarine-launched ballistic missiles, among others. Journalists have regarded STRAT-X as a major influence on the course of U.S. nuclear policy.|$|E
5|$|The {{arguments}} {{that led to}} the cancellation of the B-70 program had led some to question the need for a new strategic bomber of any sort. The USAF was adamant about retaining bombers as part of the nuclear triad concept that included bombers, ICBMs, and submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) in a combined package that complicated any potential defense. They argued that the bomber was needed to attack hardened military targets and to provide a safe counterforce option because the bombers could be quickly launched into safe loitering areas where they could not be attacked. However, the introduction of the SLBM made moot the mobility and survivability argument, and a newer generation of ICBMs, such as the Minuteman III, had the accuracy and speed needed to attack point targets. During this time, ICBMs were seen as a less costly option based on their lower unit cost, but development costs were much higher. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara preferred ICBMs over bombers for the Air Force portion of the <b>deterrent</b> <b>force</b> and felt a new expensive bomber was not needed. McNamara limited the AMSA program to studies and component development beginning in 1964.|$|E

25|$|For {{some time}} this <b>deterrent</b> <b>force</b> had {{been based on}} the Royal Air Force's V bomber force. This looked {{increasingly}} vulnerable {{in the face of}} ever-increasing Soviet Air Defence Forces, and by the late 1950s the RAF was pursuing the Blue Steel II standoff missile to allow its bombers to fire their weapons while still (hopefully) outside the range of the defensive fighters.|$|E
25|$|The Zahleh {{campaign}} {{took place}} between December 1980 and June 1981. During the seven-month period, the city of Zahleh endured a handful of political and military setbacks. The opposing key players were on the one side, the LF (Lebanese Forces) aided by Zahlawi townspeople, {{and on the other}} side, the Syrian Army Forces also known as ADF Arab <b>Deterrent</b> <b>Force,</b> aided by some PLO (Palestinian Liberation Organization) factions.|$|E
25|$|Since 2003, the B-2's forward {{presence}} {{has become}} a reality and proved the aircraft can deliver combat airpower, any time and any place. The deployment to Guam, which began in February 2005, provided a continuous bomber presence in the Asia Pacific region and augmented Pacific Command's establishment of a <b>deterrent</b> <b>force.</b> The 80-day tour, the longest in the bomber's 13-year history, also marked the first B-2 deployment since the aircraft was declared fully operational.|$|E
50|$|Although not {{considered}} part of the <b>deterrent</b> <b>forces,</b> all of the nuclear powers deployed large numbers of tactical nuclear weapons in the Cold War. These could be delivered by virtually all platforms capable of delivering large conventional weapons.|$|R
50|$|In 1962, the Strategic Air Commands 390th Strategic Missile Wing (390 SMW) and its 18 Titan II ICBM {{sites around}} Tucson were activated. The 390 SMW {{was one of}} only three Titan II missile wings in SAC and {{represented}} the heaviest land-based missile and the largest single warhead ever fielded by U.S. strategic <b>deterrent</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|R
50|$|As Chief of the Russian General Staff he {{had some}} success in {{reforming}} the command structure for the strategic <b>deterrent</b> <b>forces,</b> but feuded with Defence Minister Sergei Ivanov {{and many of his}} subordinates. Kvashnin also proved to be indecisive at times, he split then merged the Volga-Urals Military District, combined the Strategic Rocket Forces with the Russian Space Forces and the Early Warning System, then restored their independence.|$|R
25|$|In 1975, {{following}} increasing sectarian tensions, {{a full-scale}} civil {{war broke out}} in Lebanon. The Lebanese Civil War pitted a coalition of Christian groups against the joint forces of the PLO, left-wing Druze and Muslim militias. In June 1976 Lebanese President Elias Sarkis asked for the Syrian Army to intervene {{on the side of}} the Christians and help restore peace. In October 1976 the Arab League agreed to establish a predominantly Syrian Arab <b>Deterrent</b> <b>Force,</b> which was charged with restoring calm.|$|E
25|$|For {{the next}} twelve years, the 1st BS {{remained}} {{at the forefront of}} America’s nuclear <b>deterrent</b> <b>force.</b> In November 1955, the squadron helped established a non-stop point-to-point long distance record during a flight from Mountain Home Air Force Base, Idaho, to New Zealand, a distance of 8,300 miles, with the aid of aerial refueling. And from 1955 through 1958, the squadron would deploy to RAF Fairford, England; Kadena Air Base, Okinawa; Eielson Air Force Base, Alaska; and Andersen AFB, Guam.|$|E
25|$|After Belize {{achieved}} {{independence in}} 1981 the United Kingdom maintained a <b>deterrent</b> <b>force</b> (British Forces Belize) {{in the country}} to protect it from invasion by Guatemala (see Guatemalan claim to Belizean territory). During the 1980s this included a battalion and No. 1417 Flight RAF of Harriers. The main British force left in 1994, three years after Guatemala recognized Belizean independence, but the United Kingdom maintained a training presence via the British Army Training and Support Unit Belize (BATSUB) and 25 Flight AAC until 2011 when the last British Forces left Ladyville Barracks, with the exception of seconded advisers.|$|E

Its mission was the responsibility for all land-based Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles (ICBM)s. 20th Air Force's rebirth came at a time when America's nuclear forces were entering a decade of unprecedented force reductions and changes. Spawned by the Cold War's end and the breakup of the Soviet Union, these changes reshaped the basic fabric of the nation's nuclear <b>deterrent</b> <b>forces.</b>|$|R

The 78th Tactical Fighter Squadron was stationed at Woodbridge, while the 91st and 92nd were stationed at Bentwaters. The 81st TFW {{served as a}} strategic nuclear <b>deterrent</b> <b>force,</b> the Voodoo's long range putting {{almost all of the}} Warsaw Pact countries, and targets up to 500 miles deep into the Soviet Union within reach.|$|E
25|$|After {{establishment}} {{of its own}} <b>deterrent</b> <b>force,</b> the Force de Dissuassion, more {{commonly known as the}} Force de frappe, France withdrew from the military command structure of NATO in 1966. French President Charles de Gaulle viewed the operational {{establishment of}} the Mirage IV fleet, a critical component of the independent Force de frappe, as highly influential to his decision to withdraw France from NATO, and that an independent French nuclear deterrent was necessary to ensure independence as a nation. From 1964 to 1971, the Mirage IV was France's sole means of delivering nuclear ordnance, at this point they were armed with a single 60 kiloton nuclear bomb each.|$|E
25|$|In October 1976, Syria {{accepted}} the proposal of the Arab League summit in Riyadh. This gave Syria {{a mandate to}} keep 40,000 troops in Lebanon as the bulk of an Arab <b>Deterrent</b> <b>Force</b> charged with disentangling the combatants and restoring calm. Other Arab nations were {{also part of the}} ADF, but they lost interest relatively soon, and Syria was again left in sole control, now with the ADF as a diplomatic shield against international criticism. The Civil War was officially ended at this point, and an uneasy quiet settled over Beirut and {{most of the rest of}} Lebanon. In the south, however, the climate began to deteriorate as a consequence of the gradual return of PLO combatants, who had been required to vacate central Lebanon under the terms of the Riyadh Accords.|$|E
50|$|The first sea-based missile <b>deterrent</b> <b>forces</b> were a {{small number}} of {{conventionally}} powered cruise missile submarines (SSG) and surface ships fielded by the United States and the Soviet Union in the 1950s, deploying the Regulus I missile and the Soviet P-5 Pyatyorka (SS-N-3 Shaddock), both land attack cruise missiles that could be launched from surfaced submarines. Although these forces served until 1964 and (on the Soviet side) were augmented by the nuclear-powered Project 659 (Echo I class) SSGNs, they were rapidly eclipsed by SLBMs carried by nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs) beginning in 1960.|$|R
50|$|He {{continued}} the basic Truman administration policy of containment of Soviet expansion, and {{strengthening of the}} economies of Western Europe. He added more emphasis on the American (and British) nuclear <b>deterrent</b> <b>forces</b> against a major invasion. He wanted the Allies to provide local security. His goal was troop reductions in Europe, reduction of military expenditures, and a sharing of labor with European nations. Europeans, however, never quite trusted the idea of nuclear deterrence and were reluctant to shift away from NATO into a proposed European Defence Community (EDC). The result was that EDC plans were dropped and American ground troops remained stationed in Europe.|$|R
5000|$|To {{save his}} life, agent Charles Grant (Stephen Boyd), pilot Captain Bill Owens (William Redfield), Dr. Michaels (Donald Pleasence), surgeon Dr. Peter Duval (Arthur Kennedy), and his {{assistant}} Cora Peterson (Raquel Welch) are placed aboard a specially designed submarine at the C.M.D.F. (Combined Miniature <b>Deterrent</b> <b>Forces)</b> facilities. The submarine, named the Proteus, is then miniaturized and injected into Benes. The ship is reduced to one micrometer, giving the team one hour (60 minutes) to remove the clot. After the 60 minutes have elapsed, the Proteus and its crew will begin to revert to its normal size, become vulnerable to Benes's immune system, and (in the words of Asimov's novelization) [...] "kill Benes regardless {{of the success of}} the surgery." ...|$|R
25|$|At {{the time}} bombers {{had a slight}} {{performance}} advantage over fighters due to having multiple engines and streamlined, but heavy, cantilever wing designs, so a successful interception would require careful planning to bring interceptor aircraft into a suitable defensive position {{in front of the}} bombers. Before World War II and the invention of radar, detection systems were visual or auditory, which gave only a few minutes' warning. Against World War I designs these systems were marginally useful, but against 1930s aircraft flying at twice their speed or more, they did not provide enough time to arrange interception missions. This balance of force meant that bombs would be falling before the fighters were in position and there was little that could be done about it. For Britain, the answer was to concentrate on bomber production, primarily as a <b>deterrent</b> <b>force.</b>|$|E

2500|$|Since {{playing a}} decisive {{role in the}} victory, the navy has been a <b>deterrent</b> <b>force</b> {{maintaining}} peace for India in a region of turmoil. In 1983, the Indian Navy planned for Operation Lal Dora to support the government of Mauritius against a feared coup. In 1986, in Operation Flowers are Blooming, the Indian Navy averted an attempted coup in the Seychelles. In 1988, India launched Operation Cactus, to successfully thwart a coup d'état by PLOTE in the Maldives. Naval maritime reconnaissance aircraft detected the ship hijacked by PLOTE rebels.

50|$|Another {{factor in}} D. aurantiacus plants that impacts larval growth is leaf {{nitrogen}} content. Unlike resin levels, heightened nitrogen levels are correlated with increased larval growth and survivorship. In a controlled experiment, larva that were fed {{a diet of}} fertilized D. aurantiacus plants, which contained 50% more nitrogen than unfertilized plants, experienced higher survival rates and growth than larvae that fed on unfertilized plants. While leaves with increased nitrogen content are the most attractive for the larvae, {{they are also the}} most valuable carbon-gainers for the plant. This leads to the activity patterns of larvae and D. aurantiacus plants synchronizing. Larvae emerge from diapause as D. aurantiacus plants start flowering. This is when the plants need the most carbon. The plants then concentrate their resin in their youngest leaves, which contain the largest amount of nitrogen; this resin <b>deterrent</b> <b>forces</b> larvae to feed on less valuable older leaves whose nitrogen content is lower. To maximize their own nutritional benefits, larvae selectively eat leaves with the highest available nitrogen:resin ratio. In addition, larvae exhibit a strong preference for feeding on host plant leaves that have been in the sun compared to leaves that have been in the shade.|$|R
