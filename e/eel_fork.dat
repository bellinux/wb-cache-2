50|$|The East Branch South <b>Fork</b> <b>Eel</b> River, a {{tributary}} of the South <b>Fork</b> <b>Eel</b> River, is formed by the confluence of Cruso Cabin Creek and Elkhorn Creek, in Mendocino County in the U.S. state of California. The river is roughly 25 mi long, meandering west to its confluence with the South <b>Fork</b> <b>Eel</b> at Benbow Lake State Recreation Area. Major tributaries of the East Branch include Buck Mountain Creek, Squaw Creek, Rays Creek, and Tom Long Creek. The river flows west, turns north, and flows west again, through rugged terrain in the Coast Range of California. The East Branch is the South <b>Fork</b> <b>Eel's</b> largest tributary.|$|R

50|$|Cedar Creek is an 11.2 mi {{tributary}} of the South <b>Fork</b> <b>Eel</b> River in Mendocino County in the U.S. state of California. The creek begins southeast of Red Mountain, at an elevation of 778 ft. It makes an S-curve west-northwest then bends sharply south, dropping into {{the valley of the}} South <b>Fork</b> <b>Eel.</b> The confluence is south of the city of Leggett, on the river's right bank. The only named {{tributary of}} Cedar Creek is Little Cedar Creek, a headwaters tributary. Big Dann Creek joins the South <b>Fork</b> <b>Eel</b> on the same bank, just upstream of Cedar Creek, while the next major tributary downstream of Cedar is Rock Creek. The Cedar Creek watershed is rugged and has few tributaries.|$|R

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) [...] Humboldt State University, Environmental Systems: Geology, 2010 Multiple knickpoints {{are present}} in two {{tributary}} basins of the South <b>Fork</b> <b>Eel</b> River. These tributaries are downstream from a major knickpoint on the South <b>Fork</b> <b>Eel</b> River, which may be a transient knickpoint propagating base-level fall throughout the basin. Knickpoints are identified from longitudinal profiles extracted from LiDARderived DEMs. Knickpoints and knickzones, knickzones being the immediate downstream reach of higher gradient, are present throughout the two basins. Many of the knickpoints display correlative elevations between the two basins. Knickpoints are most common on first-order streams, and knickpoint frequency decreases with increasing stream order. Major knickzones were found throughout the basins, but the largest knickzone reaches were found closest to the basin outlets. Although only the lowest major knickpoints on each tributary likely correlate with the major knickpoint on the South Fork, {{it does appear that}} knickpoints in these tributary basins are the result of multiple instances of base-level lowering on the South <b>Fork</b> <b>Eel</b> River...|$|R

50|$|Below the dam {{the river}} turns north, flowing {{through a long}} {{isolated}} valley, receiving Outlet Creek from the west and then the Middle <b>Fork</b> <b>Eel</b> River from the east at Dos Rios. About 20 mi downstream, the North <b>Fork</b> <b>Eel</b> River - draining {{one of the most}} rugged and remote portions of the watershed - joins from the east. Between the North and Middle Forks the Round Valley Indian Reservation lies east of the Eel River. After this confluence the Eel flows briefly through southwestern Trinity County, past Island Mountain, before entering Humboldt County near Alderpoint.|$|R
5000|$|Primary human {{usage of}} the basin include very limited farming, ranching, grazing and logging. A study {{conducted}} in 1996 reported that the North <b>Fork</b> <b>Eel</b> River basin has only 200 full-time residents. About 50 {{percent of the land}} is government-owned, 48% are private, and 2% belongs to the Round Valley Indian Reservation. Recreational uses, such as hunting and boating, are more common. For rafting, the North <b>Fork</b> <b>Eel</b> River is considered a very [...] "difficult" [...] river, shallow and fluctuating highly in flow, with Class IV and III rapids decreasing in size closer to the mouth.|$|R

5000|$|In 1967, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers {{proposed}} {{to build an}} enormous dam just above {{the confluence of the}} Eel River and the Middle <b>Fork</b> <b>Eel</b> River at Dos Rios. The Dos Rios Dam would have been 730 ft tall, creating a reservoir that covered 110000 acre of land (including Round Valley, the Middle <b>Fork</b> <b>Eel</b> River watershed's primary agricultural area and also the location of the town of Covelo, plus the Round Valley Indian Reservation). If built, this dam would have diverted most of the flow of the river into the Central Valley for irrigation purposes. The project was defeated by outcry from local residents and the intervention of then-California governor Ronald Reagan. Reagan remarked, [...] "Enough treaties had already been broken with the Indians".|$|R
