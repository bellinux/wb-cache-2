500|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} disorders of consciousness goes by the name anosognosia, a Greek-derived term meaning unawareness of disease. [...] This is a condition in which patients are disabled in some way, most commonly {{as a result of a}} stroke, but either misunderstand the nature of the problem or deny that there is anything wrong with them. [...] The most frequently occurring form is seen in people who have experienced a stroke damaging the parietal lobe in the right hemisphere of the brain, giving rise to a syndrome known as hemispatial neglect, characterized by an inability to direct action or attention toward objects located to the left with respect to their bodies. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect are often paralyzed on the right side of the body, but sometimes deny being unable to move. [...] When questioned about the obvious problem, the patient may avoid giving a direct answer, or may give an explanation that doesn't make sense. [...] Patients with hemispatial neglect may also fail to recognize paralyzed parts of their bodies: [...] one frequently mentioned case is of a man who repeatedly tried to throw his own paralyzed right leg out of the bed he was lying in, and when asked what he was doing, complained that somebody had put a <b>dead</b> <b>leg</b> into the bed with him. [...] An even more striking type of anosognosia is Anton–Babinski syndrome, a rarely occurring condition in which patients become blind but claim to be able to see normally, and persist in this claim in spite of all evidence to the contrary.|$|E

50|$|For wet etch and clean, most {{tools are}} single wafer processes, which require {{flow through the}} filter upon tool demand. The {{resultant}} intermittent flow, which will range from full flow through the filter upon initiation of UPW flow through the spray nozzle, {{and then back to}} a trickle flow. The trickle flow is typically maintained to prevent a <b>dead</b> <b>leg</b> in the tool. The filter must be robust to withstand the pressure and low cycling, and must continue to retain captured particles throughout the service life of the filter. This requires proper pleat design and geometry, as well as media designed to optimized particle capture and retention. Certain tools may use a fixed filter housing with replaceable filters, whereas other tools may use disposable filter capsules for the POU UPW.|$|E

50|$|Bacteria {{have been}} {{referred}} to {{as one of the most}} obstinate in this list to control. Techniques that help in minimizing bacterial colony growth within UPW streams include occasional chemical or steam sanitization (which is common in the pharmaceutical industry), ultrafiltration (found in some pharmaceutical, but mostly semiconductor industries), ozonation and optimization of piping system designs that promote the use of Reynolds Number criteria for minimum flow along with minimization of <b>dead</b> <b>legs.</b> In modern advanced UPW systems positive (higher than zero) bacteria counts are typically observed in the newly constructed facilities. This issue is effectively addressed by sanitization using ozone or hydrogen peroxide. With proper design of the polishing and distribution system no positive bacteria counts are typically detected throughout the life cycle of the UPW system.|$|R

In this latter sense, such an injury is known as <b>dead</b> <b>leg.</b> [...] In Australia it is also known as a corked thigh or corky.
