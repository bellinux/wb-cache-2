40|$|The recent {{interest}} {{in the use of}} CATV networks for advanced telecommunication purposes has spurred research in modems for upstream communication. Signal disturbances along the upstream path necessitate the use of advanced signal processing methods. One of these disturbances is group delay distortion. This paper describes two algorithmic alternatives to solve this particular problem. I. Introduction Recently, coaxial cable networks have received much attention in the context of interactive applications [1], [4]. In countries with a high penetration of CATV (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>Belgium</b> ? 90 %), the cable network forms a viable alternative to classical telephone networks. Envisaged applications include telephony, interactive television, home-shopping, video-on-demand and high-speed internet browsing.

40|$|We {{outline the}} {{competitive}} television news {{market in the}} enlarged European Union (EU) and demonstrate the continued importance of traditional media, in particular television, {{in the context of}} proliferation in choice of news sources, including on-line news services. Drawing upon a content analysis of the most widely watched evening television news programs in each of the EU countries, we find that on average, EU news in 2004 was more visible in the new member states than in the old member states. The level of coverage in the old member states was slightly higher in 2004 compared to 1999. Looking at individual countries there was considerable variation with some countries (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Greece, Denmark, Slovakia, and Austria) devoting about 20 % of the news to the elections and others (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> Germany, <b>Belgium,</b> and the Czech Republic) devoting about 5 % or less to the elections...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCompared {{with natural}} conception, IVF is an {{effective}} form of fertility treatment associated with higher rates of obstetric complications and poorer neonatal outcomes. While some increased risk is intrinsic to the infertile population requiring treatment, the practice of multiple embryo transfer contributes to these complications and outcomes, especially concerning its role in higher order pregnancies. As a result, several jurisdictions (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> Sweden, <b>Belgium,</b> Turkey, and Quebec) have legally mandated elective single-embryo transfer (eSET) for young women. We accept that in very high-risk scenarios (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> past history of preterm delivery and poor maternal health), double-embryo transfer (DET) should be prohibited due to unacceptably high risks. However, we argue that mandating eSET for all young women can be considered an unacceptable breach of patient autonomy, especially since DET offers certain women financial and social advantages. We also show that mandated eSET is inconsistent with other practices (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> ovulation induction and intrauterine insemination–ovulation induction) that can expose women and their offspring to risks associated with multiple pregnancies. While defending the option of DET for certain women, some recommendations are offered regarding IVF practice (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> preimplantation genetic screening and better support of IVF and maternity leave) to incentivise patients to choose eSET...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent decades}} {{a large number}} of new {{sovereign}} states has been created through secessions, decolonization and breakup of existing countries. Since 1990 the Soviet Union split into fifteen independent countries, Yugoslavia gave away to six sovereign states (not counting Kosovo), Czechoslavakia broke into two separate states, Eritrea seceded from Ethiopia, Namibia gained indepen- dence from South Africa, and Timor Leste left Indonesia. Today there are 193 internationally recognized sovereign states in the world, up from 74 in 1945 (the latest UN member is Montenegro, which joined in 2006). At the same time numerous countries, while remaining unified, have taken steps towards more regional autonomy and decentralization.

40|$|We {{present a}} model with adverse {{selection}} where information sharing between lenders arises endogenously. Lenders' incentives {{to share information}} about borrowers are positively related to the mobility and heterogeneity of borrowers, {{to the size of}} the credit market and to advances in information technology; on the other hand, such incentives are reduced by the fear of competition from potential entrants. In addition, information sharing increases the volume of lending when adverse selection is so severe that safe borrowers drop out of the market. These predictions are supported by international and historical evidence in the context of the consumer credit market.

About two thousand years ago Greek and Latin had a lasting influence especially on Western European languages, whereas in the beginning modem era French became the prevailing idiom, which is nowadays removed from English as the language of technology and culture. In addition peoples migrations because of wars and poverty as well as increasing tendencies of globalisation raise the clashes of different languages and cultures all over Europe.

40|$|It is {{difficult}} to analyse private universities in Europe (including those {{that are part of}} the EUEREK case studies) in the context of entrepreneurialism in the form the concept has emerged in the basic literature on the subject and available case studies. The private sector in higher education in Europe, with several exceptions (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> Portugal and Spain) — from the point of view of both numbers of institutions, share of enrolments in the sector, and study areas offered — has been an educational phenomenon of the transition countries. In some countries (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> Sweden, <b>Belgium,</b> and the Netherlands), nominally private institutions are funded in practice with public money, in various forms and under different umbrellas. This chapter is based, in more theoretical terms, on the conceptual work on 'entrepreneurial', 'enterprising', and 'proactive' universities by Clark 'self-reliant' and 'enterprising' — as well as; more generally, 'successful' — universities by Shattock and Williams, and Sporn's notion of 'adaptive' universities.

40|$|Economic {{research}} has inquired {{the role of}} asymmetric information between central and local governments in shaping the structure of optimal regional grants. In the mainstream literature, the theoretical setting has been characterized by some basic informational asymmetry between central authority and local government (the informed party) {{about the state of}} regional social and economic fundamentals (i. e. adverse selection). This setting fits quite well in the stylized facts of consolidated federalism, while it is hardly satisfactory in the case of devolved-powers states: fiscal systems that were recently reformed in the sense of higher degree of decentralization of policy decision-making and implementation (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> : <b>Belgium,</b> Italy, etc.). This paper points out that the situation of newly decentralized public systems is better analyzed under pure moral hazard : the only source of asymmetric information is the imperfect verifiability of local policy (while the information about social and economic fundamentals is symmetric). Building on a simple model, it is shown that the sign of optimal distortion that grants induce on regional fiscal policy is likely to differ between federalism (adverse selection and moral hazard) and devolution (pure moral hazard) ...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The European Economic Union (EEU) {{adopted a}} single currency, the “euro” on January 1, 1999. Such a {{development}} has far-reaching implications {{for development of}} information systems, the engines {{that will have to}} run and control the new monetary order. For example, euro-compliant systems will need to accommodate: (1) six decimal places, a major change for those companies in countries that did not require decimal places (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>Belgium</b> and Italy), or even those that require only two, (2) “triangulation ” between curren-cies rather than classic inversion, (3) multiple currencies for each transaction, and (4) differ-ences between invoice amounts and amounts actually paid, since there can be rounding differences on conversions with triangulation. These changes are just the surface require-ments for the euro currency change. Because the euro problem is very new, few companies have begun, let alone completed making, their euro systems changes. As a result, limited research is available regarding the euro. The {{purpose of this article is}} to help fill this void by examining the principal issues of the euro’s impact on information systems and to identify research opportunities related to the euro problem...|$|E
40|$|Political careers {{have become}} more diversified in {{multi-level}} systems over the last decades. In ‘classic’ federations (e. g. the US, Canada, and Germany), regional offices have become attractive positions {{with the process of}} professionalization. In newly regional political systems (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>Belgium,</b> Spain, and the UK), the regional level has been quickly perceived by ambitious candidates as a professionalized political arena. Overall, regional positions in multi-level contexts are no longer conceived as amateur positions or mere stepping stones towards the national level.

This paper discusses the benefits and limitations of a mix-methods research design relevant for the study of elites’ career patterns.

40|$|This article proposes and applies {{a method}} to {{estimate}} the revenues of beggars in Brussels (Belgium). This is relevant for three reasons. First, though {{the literature on the}} informal economy assumes that the income will be low, we lack reliable empirical knowledge of informal street-level activities like begging, in particular due to the prevalence of many irregular Eastern-European immigrants among the begging population. Second, popular representation of beggars often depicts them as fraudulent, criminal and wealthy. Finally, the assumption of criminal organizations behind beggars legitimated the recent criminalization of (aspects of) begging in Western countries, <b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> in <b>Belgium</b> and France. An analysis of existing attempts to measure beggars’ income teaches us that the best design is to triangulate with data from different sources. Three datasets were collected, based on observation, self-reports and quasi-experimental observations. The combination of these datasets allows for more reliable and valid conclusions. The hypotheses based upon popular myths and the assumptions behind the criminalization of begging are dismissed. The evidence does seem to support the hypothesis based upon the literature on informal activities. begging; informal economy; hard-to-reach populations; poverty; income...|$|R

40|$|In this presentation, I briefly review current {{practices}} {{in different countries}} (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> USA, <b>Belgium)</b> concerning the interim storage of intermediate and high-level radioactive waste. Drawing on ongoing research within the Programme for the Integration of Social Aspects into nuclear research (PISA) at the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre SCK-CEN, I provide a definition of interim storage and outline a possible research agenda for this area. Interim storage {{is defined as the}} stowing of high-level radioactive waste in temporary facilities for an indefinite period, until a more permanent solution is established. As the large majority of countries still has decades, if not centuries, to go before geological disposal facilities become operational, the notions of “temporary” and “interim” cover immense timespans that remain unaccounted for by scientists, technologists, regulators, implementers, and policy makers. It is therefore worth asking the following research questions: Which social, legal, and ethical considerations come into play when the concepts of “temporary” and “interim” are stretched? How do social, legal, and technical considerations interact with regard to (prolonged) interim storage facility safety? The outputs of this line of investigation are relevant to all actors involved in radioactive waste management, including governments, waste management organisations, civil society, and wider publics...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{psychotropic drug}} {{utilization}} {{in the general}} population of six European countries, and the pattern of use in individuals with different DSM-IV diagnoses of 12 -month mental disorders. METHOD: Data were derived from the European Study of the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMeD/MHEDEA 2000), a cross-sectional psychiatric epidemiological study in a representative sample of 21 425 adults aged 18 or older from six European countries (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>Belgium,</b> France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain). Individuals were asked about any psychotropic drug use in the past 12 months, even if they used the drug(s) just once. A colour booklet containing high-quality pictures of psychotropic drugs commonly used to treat mental disorders was provided to help respondents recall drug use. RESULTS: Psychotropic drug utilization is generally low in individuals with any 12 -month mental disorder (32. 6 %). The extent of psychotropic drug utilization varied according to the specific DSM-IV diagnosis. Among individuals with a 12 -month diagnosis of pure major depression, only 21. 2 % had received any antidepressants within the same period; the exclusive use of antidepressants was even lower (4. 6 %), while more individuals took only anxiolytics (18. 4 %). CONCLUSION: These data question the appropriateness of current pharmacological treatments, particularly for major depression, in which under-treatment is coupled with the high use of non-specific medications, such as anxiolytics. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Previous {{research}} {{suggests that there is}} a rather heterogeneous use of the Internet as an instrument for investor relations and corporate reporting between companies and between countries. In this paper we investigate whether these differences in Internet reporting policies might be due to cultural differences in corporate reporting. According to Hofstede (1980) and Gray (1988), there are cultural differences between distinct groups of countries in Europe. The accounting frameworks of European countries are merely classified as more developed Latin (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>Belgium,</b> France), Anglo (e. g. UK, Ireland), Germanic (e. g. Germany, Austria) and Nordic (Netherlands, Denmark). Since corporate reporting on the Internet is typically voluntary, the secretiveness of these different cultural groups may influence Internet reporting practices. Also other culturally related factors like the judicial system (code vs. common law), the shareholder vs. stakeholder approach, … may influence Internet reporting practices. Our sample of 60 companies from the UK, Belgium and Germany tries to give an indication of the main cultural spectrum of Western Europe. All companies are analysed by visiting their websites – if present and traceable. A prior-tested list of website features and reporting contents is used {{in order to determine the}} factors that influence Corporate Internet Reporting. The results of this study might be useful to standardising committees who consider regulating the Internet corporate reporting scene and to all other interested parties.

In countries where a substantial proportion of drinking water is produced from surface water, <b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>Belgium,</b> this poses a constant threat on drinking water safety. Our objective was to monitor the presence of Cryptosporidium and Giardia in different water catchment sites in Belgium and to discriminate between (oo) cysts from human or animal origin using genotyping. Monthly samples were collected from raw water and purified drinking water at four catchment sites. Cryptosporidium and Giardia were detected using USEPA method 1623 and positive samples were genotyped. No contamination was found in purified water at any site. In three catchments, only low numbers of (oo) cysts were recovered from raw water samples (< 1 /liter), but raw water samples from one catchment site were frequently contaminated with Giardia (92 %) and Cryptosporidium (96 %), especially in winter and spring. Genotyping of Giardia in 38 water samples identified the presence of Giardia duodenalis assemblage AI, AII, BIV, BIV-like, and E. Cryptosporidium andersoni, Cryptosporidium suis, Cryptosporidium horse genotype, Cryptosporidium parvum, and Cryptosporidium hominis were detected. The genotyping results suggest that agriculture {{may be a more}} important source of surface water contamination than human waste in this catchment.

40|$|This article {{examines}} the consequences of contracting-out {{on the basis of}} the four criteria of efficiency, economy, effectiveness and equality (3 or 4 e's concept), which are borrowed from New Public Management research. The paper is based on 76 expert interviews and informative discussions conducted in the three countries. In addition, contractual documents and other primary sources were evaluated and the existing secondary literature was taken into account. To sum up, private providers seem to have advantages in all four dimensions. Efficiency can be increased by competition incentives, outcome-dependent payment and a sustained measurement of performance. It is possible to achieve a higher level of economy by means of modern personnel policy and the scope available to private providers in buying in additional expertise for their case management. The effectiveness of job placement is raised in particular by the flexibility of the providers. The danger of private providers taking the pick of the bunch can be counteracted, perhaps even better than in a public employment service, by various mechanisms (e. g. performance measurement, differentiation of target groups or involvement of the job-seekers in the quality control). The increasing distribution of contracting-out in countries other than those observed here (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>Belgium,</b> Denmark) should be a reason to lead an open discussion about this reform approach in Germany too.

An important issue is the decisive separation of two concepts: waste generated and waste collected. The study includes analysis of the generation rate for Poland with division into urban and rural areas. The estimated and projected rate of municipal waste generation for Poland provided in subsequent editions of National Waste Management Plans (KPGO) changed since 2000 within wide range from about 300 to more than 500 kg per capita in an individual year (kg/pc/year). Currently, the National Waste Management Plan for the years 2017 - 2022 estimates municipal waste generation rate at approx. 270 kg/per capita/year with a projected increase to 330 kg/per capita/year in 2030. Most European countries adopt higher municipal waste generation rate, often exceeding 600 kg/per capita/year.

About 1 : 6000 do have problems with information exchange in their daily practice, such as patients with severe autistic disorders, and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), Locked-in Syndrome (LIS) and Speech and Language Impaired (SLI) patients, and their communication is often limited to care takers and family, because the interaction with other people through electronic systems often fails. In fact, all these disabled yearn to basically participate in our society. Enhancing the amount of adapted devices and personal care takers has huge consequences and is mostly unfeasible by firm limits in specialists, infrastructure and budget. The quality of life can be graded up by a service-oriented {{information architecture}} that supports an on-line Mind Speller®, i. e., a Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) that enables subjects to spell text on a computer screen, and potentially have it voiced, without muscular activity, to assist or enable patients to communicate, but also to provide speech revalidation, as in autism spectrum disorder patients. The Mind Speller® operates non-invasively by detecting P 300 signals in their EEG. With the support of predictive text algorithms, the mind spelled characters will be words and sentences, and even stories (story telling), enabling the communication-disabled to participate in either the physical environment as - by the Internet - the global digital world. status: publishe...|$|R

Acta Psychiatr Scand 2004 : 109 (Suppl. 420) : 55 - 64. © Blackwell Munksgaard 2004. Objective: To assess psychotropic drug utilization {{in the general population}} of six European countries, and the pattern of use in individuals with different DSM-IV diagnoses of 12 -month mental disorders. Method: Data were derived from the European Study of the Epidemiology of Mental Disorders (ESEMeD/MHEDEA 2000), a cross-sectional psychiatric epidemiological study in a representative sample of 21 [*] 425 adults aged 18 or older from six European countries (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>Belgium,</b> France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain). Individuals were asked about any psychotropic drug use in the past 12 [*]months, even if they used the drug(s) just once. A colour booklet containing high-quality pictures of psychotropic drugs commonly used to treat mental disorders was provided to help respondents recall drug use. Results: Psychotropic drug utilization is generally low in individuals with any 12 -month mental disorder (32. 6 %). The extent of psychotropic drug utilization varied according to the specific DSM-IV diagnosis. Among individuals with a 12 -month diagnosis of pure major depression, only 21. 2 % had received any antidepressants within the same period; the exclusive use of antidepressants was even lower (4. 6 %), while more individuals took only anxiolytics (18. 4 %). Conclusion: These data question the appropriateness of current pharmacological treatments, particularly for major depression, in which under-treatment is coupled with the high use of non-specific medications, such as anxiolytics...|$|E
40|$|The American duckweed Lemna minuta Kunth is {{considered}} an invasive species in several European countries (<b>e.</b> <b>g.,</b> <b>Belgium,</b> Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy), but its invasiveness outside its original range remains poorly studied. We therefore analyse: (i) {{the speed with which}} L. minuta has spread throughout Europe; and (ii) its capability to compete with L. minor L., the most common European native duckweed. Based on literature data, the increasing number of observations of L. minuta since it was reported for the ﬁrst time in France (1966) indicated the wide extent reached by this species in most of Europe, highlighting its high capacity to colonize new areas. By samplingLemna populations from 41 stations in standing waters in Central Italy, it emerged that the frequency of the two species was similar, but the alien species was more abundant than the native one, showing generally higher coverages, and predominating in mixed Lemna populations. A negative correlation between L. minuta and L. minor was observed in our study. This relationship was not explained by different ecological requirements, since the two species responded similarly to the main environmental gradient, but was linked to an antagonistic dynamism between both species. A multitemporal analysis, based on the comparison of Lemna coverage data recorded at the same stations at two different times (last vs. ﬁrst record), revealed that L. minuta had appeared where it had been absent previously and that its abundance had increased to the detriment of L. minor, which in some cases disappeared within a few years. The arrival of L. minuta in a site can be considered a real threat to conservation of the native plant diversity due to its competition with the congeneric L. minor...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Our aim was {{to provide}} an {{up-to-date}} and review the incidence and mortality of oral and pharyngeal cancer in Europe. Methods: Data were retrieved from both national and regional population-based cancer registries. The online browser {{used in the present}} study was the European Network of Cancer Registries (EUREG. Version 1. 0), which provided data for 22 countries of Northern and Eastern Europe and for 20 countries of Western and Southern Europe on the incidence of and mortality for oral and pharyngeal cancer. For countries not included in EUREG, data were retrieved from the European Cancer Estimates (EUCAN), the Global Cancer Estimates (GLOBOCAN) and Cancer Incidence in Five Continents. Oral cancer sub-sites were classified according to International Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems, 10 th Edition categories. Results: Hungary recorded highest rates among European countries for both morbidity and mortality. Historically, France has had high rates particularly in areas in the north of France, where oral cancer was the most common in men. A decline in the incidence has been noted in the past one and half decades. However, France still has the highest incidence rates of orophayngeal cancer, one of the highest in the world. Denmark records high rates of oral cancer in women and lip cancer incidence is high in Spain. Conclusions: In Europe, regional differences in oral and pharyngeal cancer in terms of incidence and mortality are evident not only between north and south and between east and west but also within single regions (e. g. between the Scandinavian countries and the former Soviet republics). These findings reflect differences in lifestyle and in exposure to risk factors such as smoking (e. g. high incidence in Danish women), alcohol (e. g. in Lithuanian men) or both (<b>e.</b> <b>g.</b> <b>Belgium</b> and Portugal). Other traditional factors, such as actinic radiation, are responsible for a considerable number of cases of lip cancer (e. g. Spain), and oncogenic potential of human papillomavirus explains the rising trend in oropharyngeal cancer in some countries (e. g. Denmark and Scotland). Full Tex...|$|E
