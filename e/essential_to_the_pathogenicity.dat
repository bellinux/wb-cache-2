40|$|Shigella flexneri is a gram negative, rod shaped {{bacterium}} {{that is the}} causative {{agent of}} bacillary dysentery, which is characterized by fever, abdominal pain, and bloody diarrhea. Genes <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pathogenicity</b> of S. flexneri are encoded by a virulence plasmid. Shigella has evolved a complex regulatory system to regulate transcription of virulence genes. This involves two regulators, VirF and VirB, which allow the bacterium to respond to environmental stimuli and maximally exploit host niches. An additional factor impacting virulence gene regulation is H-NS, a histone nucleoid structuring protein that globally represses transcription. This work addresses the transcriptional regulation of icsP and ospZ, divergent virulence plasmid encoded genes. Analysis of the intergenic region shared by icsP and ospZ has identified remote VirB binding sites essential to icsP promoter activity. Analyses of the requirements for VirB-dependent regulation of icsP promoter activity identified the VirB binding sites as a cis -acting element with small spacing requirements. In addition, analyses of H-NS-dependent regulation of the icsP promoter showed that intrinsic curvature {{does not have a}} role in H-NS mediated repression. Together, these data indicate that the VirB and H-NS interact to modulate icsP promoter activity, demonstrating that transcriptional regulation is an intricate process...|$|E

A number of different mutation types and locations in the THAP 1 gene {{have been associated with}} a range of severity and dystonia phenotypes, but, as yet, it has been difficult to identify clear genotype phenotype patterns. Here, we screened the THAP 1 gene in a further series of dystonia cases and evaluated <b>the</b> mutation <b>pathogenicity</b> in this series as well as previously reported mutations to investigate possible phenotype-genotype correlations. THAP 1 mutations have been identified throughout the coding region of the gene, with the greatest concentration of variants localized <b>to</b> <b>the</b> THAP 1 domain. In the additional cases analyzed here, a further two mutations were found. No obvious, indisputable genotype-phenotype correlation emerged from these data.

Gómez-Muñoz for making flow cytometry facilities available and SGIker (Analytical and High-Resolution Microscopy in Biomedicine Service of the UPV/ EHU) and Monty Krieger for kindly providing CHO-ldlA 7 cells. Capillary sequencing was performed at Unidade de Tecnologia e Inovação (Departamento de Genética Humana, Instituto Nacional de Saúde Doutor Ricardo Jorge). Purpose: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) {{is one of}} the most common monogenic disorders, and the high concentrations of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol presented since birth confers on these patients an increased cardiovascular risk. More than 1, 600 alterations have been described in the LDL receptor gene (LDLR), but a large number need to be validated as mutations causing disease to establish a diagnosis of FH. This study aims to characterize, both at the phenotypic and genotypic levels, families with a clinical diagnosis of FH and present evidence for the importance of the integration of clinical, molecular, and functional data for the correct diagnosis of patients with FH. Methods:A detailed analysis of the phenotype and genotype presented by 55 families with 13 different alterations in the LDLR was conducted. For eight of these, an extensive functional characterization was performed by flow cytometry, confocal microscopy, and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. Results:Carriers of neutral alterations presented a significantly lower incidence of premature cardiovascular disease, lower levels of atherogenic lipoproteins and a large number of these individuals had LDL-cholesterol values below the 75 th percentile. presented a significantly lower incidence of premature cardiovascular disease, lower levels of atherogenic lipoproteins and a large number of these individuals had LDL-cholesterol values below the 75 th percentile However, the functional study was <b>essential</b> <b>to</b> determine <b>the</b> <b>pathogenicity</b> of variants.

40|$|Superoxide dismutases (SODs) play an {{important}} role in protection against oxidative stress and have been shown <b>to</b> contribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pathogenicity</b> of many bacterial species. <b>To</b> determine <b>the</b> function of the mycobacterial copper and zinc-cofactored SOD (CuZnSOD), we constructed and characterized Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Mycobacterium bovis BCG CuZnSOD null mutants. Both strains were more sensitive to superoxides and hydrogen peroxide than were their respective parental strains. The survival of M. bovis BCG in unstimulated as well as activated mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages was not affected by the loss of CuZnSOD. The survival of CuZnSOD deficient-M. tuberculosis in guinea pig tissues was comparable to that of its parental strain.

A full-length genome plasmid encoding the complete antigenomic cDNA of the RC-HL strain and helper plasmids containing cDNAs of the complete open reading frame of the N, P, and L genes, respectively, were constructed. After transfection of these plasmids into BHK- 21 cells infected with the T 7 RNA polymerase-expressing vaccinia virus, infectious rabies virus with almost the same biological properties {{as those of the}} wild-type RC-HL strain was rescued. Using this reverse genetics system of the RC-HL strain, we generated a chimeric virus with the open reading frame of the glycoprotein gene from the parent Nishigahara strain, which kills adult mice after intracerebral inoculation, in the background of the RC-HL genome.

Recently, we isolated two A. veronii strains, named GYC 1 and GYC 2, from diseased Gibel carp (Carassius gibelio) in China. Based on gyrB (DNA gyrase B subunit) genes of GYC 1 and GYC 2, the constructed phylogenetic tree showed that the two strains were clustered with A. veronii. Sixteen virulence genes related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>pathogenicity</b> of Aeromonas spp. were subjected <b>to</b> PCR assay. <b>The</b> genes of ompAI, ompAII, lafA, act, aer, fla, gcaT and acg were detected in the two strains, while genes of hly, ahp, lip, ast and alt were not detected.
