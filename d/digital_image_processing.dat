25|$|From {{the late}} 1980s onward, digital imaging {{technology}} was reintroduced to fluoroscopy after development of improved detector systems.

25|$|What {{distinguished}} {{computer vision}} from the prevalent field of <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> {{at that time}} was a desire to extract three-dimensional structure from images with the goal of achieving full scene understanding.

25|$|Focus {{stacking}} is a <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> technique {{which combines}} multiple images taken at different focus distances {{to give a}} resulting image with a greater depth of field {{than any of the}} individual source images.

Knowledge of normal anatomy as well as of its variations is helpful in images interpretation and to address surgical planning on a case-by-case basis.

25|$|High-pass and {{low-pass}} filters {{are also used}} in <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> to perform image modifications, enhancements, noise reduction, etc., using designs done in either the spatial domain or the frequency domain. The unsharp masking, or sharpening, operation used in image editing software is a high-boost filter, a generalization of high-pass. A high-pass filter, if the imaging software does not provide one, {{can be achieved by}} duplicating the image, applying a Gaussian blur to the dupe, inverting the colors, and blending the images using a low opacity (say 50%) for the dupe.|$|E
25|$|It {{was only}} {{with the advent of}} <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> that {{multiple}} images could be quickly and easily combined into one. The Library of Congress undertook a project in 2000 to make digital scans of all the photographic material received from Prokudin-Gorsky's heirs and contracted with the photographer Walter Frankhauser to combine the monochrome negatives into color images. He created 122 color renderings using a method he called digichromatography and commented that each image took him around six to seven hours to align, clean and color-correct. In 2001, the Library of Congress produced an exhibition from these, The Empire That Was Russia: The Prokudin-Gorskii Photographic Record Recreated. The photographs have since been the subject of many other exhibitions in the area where Prokudin-Gorsky took his photos.|$|E
25|$|A {{pioneering}} three-color additive {{system was}} patented in England by Edward Raymond Turner in 1899. It used a rotating set of red, {{green and blue}} filters to photograph the three color components {{one after the other}} on three successive frames of panchromatic black-and-white film. The finished film was projected through similar filters to reconstitute the color. In 1902, Turner shot test footage to demonstrate his system, but projecting it proved problematic because of the accurate registration (alignment) of the three separate color elements required for acceptable results. Turner died a year later without having satisfactorily projected the footage. In 2012, curators at the National Media Museum in Bradford, UK, had the original custom-format nitrate film copied to black-and-white 35mm film, which was then scanned into a digital video format by telecine. Finally, <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> was used to align and combine each group of three frames into one color image. The result is that the whole world can now view brief motion pictures from 1902 in full color.|$|E

25|$|Thus, {{over time}} the cameras and {{recording}} media for fluoroscopic imaging have progressed as follows. The original kind of fluoroscopy, and the common kind for its first half century of existence, simply used none, because for most diagnosis and treatment, they weren't essential. For those investigations {{that needed to be}} transmitted or recorded (such as for training or research), movie cameras using film (such as 16 mm film) were the medium. In the 1950s, analog electronic video cameras (at first only producing live output but later using video tape recorders) appeared. Since the 1990s, there have been digital video cameras, flat panel detectors, and storage of data to local servers or (more recently) secure cloud servers. Late-model fluoroscopes all use <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> and image analysis software, which not only helps to produce optimal image clarity and contrast but also allows that result with a minimal radiation dose (because signal processing can take tiny inputs from low radiation doses and amplify them while to some extent also differentiating signal from noise).|$|E

500|$|Regarding {{graphic design}} and images, a common feature of grunge bands {{was the use}} of [...] "lo-fi" [...] (low fidelity) and {{deliberately}} unconventional album covers, for example presenting intentionally murky or miscolored photography, collage or distressed lettering. Early grunge [...] "lbum covers and concert flyers appeared Xeroxed not in allegiance to some DIY aesthetic" [...] but because of [...] "economic necessity", as [...] "bands had so little money". This was already a common feature of punk rock design, but could be extended in the grunge period due to the increasing use of Macintosh computers for desktop publishing and <b>digital</b> <b>image</b> <b>processing.</b> The style was sometimes called 'grunge typography' when used outside music.

40|$|A highly {{influential}} {{factor in}} the performance of <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> algorithms is the amount of noise present in the <b>digital</b> <b>image.</b> A priori knowledge of the expected levels of noise in the image dramatically improves the performance and efficiency in <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> routines. In a <b>digital</b> photofinishing system, <b>image</b> noise is primarily attributed to film grain and scanner noise. Therefore, if the film and scanner sources are known, it is possible to deduce the expected noise level in a <b>digital</b> <b>image.</b> However, <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> applied to the image after scanning will affect the noise statistics. In order for the <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> algorithms to deliver optimum performance, the estimated noise statistics need to be modified according to each processing step applied. We consider image-processing operations as applying transformations to the image data, and corresponding ones to the image noise statistics. We will discuss analytic equations that approximate the propagation of image noise statistics through several basic image transformations, and their interaction with algorithms in a <b>digital</b> photofinishing <b>image</b> chain...|$|R
