40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to {{identify}} and define a set of criteria by which building materials and elements can be assessed in terms of forming part of closed <b>loop</b> material <b>cycle,</b> and from which legally binding targets can be developed to support good practice in relation to sustainable material design in the built environment. An initial investigation into the research context of sustainability applied to the built environment and the means of implementing good practice in the building industry {{is followed by a}} review of selected sustainable material design philosophies. Based on a synthesis of these philosophies and how they can be applied to building practice, the dissertation proposes a concept for a comprehensive approach to sustainable material design that incorporates a requirement for close <b>loop</b> material <b>cycle</b> construction. The characteristics of closed <b>loop</b> material <b>cycles</b> and their relevance to the building industry are considered, and a set of criteria for closed <b>loop</b> material <b>cycle</b> construction is formulated, drawing on existing research and guidance on natural recovery and design for deconstruction and recycling. The criteria are applied in a pilot assessment of selected materials, building elements and three whole house designs, which suggests that closed <b>loop</b> material <b>cycle</b> construction is technically feasible. The assessment results are used to suggest possible practical good practice targets for closed <b>loop</b> material <b>cycle</b> construction content that are achievable for mainstream housing construction and that can bring significant benefits in terms of improving the sustainability of construction developments. The dissertation concludes with a critical reflection on the conceptual development and practical application of the closed <b>loop</b> material <b>cycle</b> criteria and proposes an agenda for further research in this field.

40|$|Chemical and {{carbonate}} <b>looping</b> <b>cycles</b> have {{a strong}} potential for efficient CO 2 capture with limited energy penalty. The main objective of this thesis is to assess the feasibil- ity and to evaluate the potential of these solid <b>looping</b> <b>cycles</b> in integrated gasification combined cycles (IGCC) power plants. Chemical looping combustion (CLC) can replace the combustion chamber of the con- ventional gas turbine cycle. The integration of this process can result in nearly 100 % car- bon capture efficiency and around 5 % electrical efficiency penalty of the combined cycle. The sensitivity analysis reveals the strong impact of the oxidation reactor temperature and of the pressure ratio. Several configurations of the combined cycles with, for example, CO 2 -turbine and top firing have thus been proposed and can all achieve close to 100 % CO 2 -capture. Chemical looping gasification (CLG) {{does not have the}} potential of capturing carbon dioxide but eliminates the need for a cryogenic distillation unit and ease the generation of synthesis gas. However, the type of oxygen carrier, the solids flow rate and the oxygen- to-fuel ratios are critical design factors for a successful integration of CLG. Carbonate looping ex situ allows the capture of carbon dioxide by moving the equi- librium of the water-gas shift reaction towards the generation of hydrogen. The capture of carbon dioxide can reach up to 93 % and its purity up to 97 %. This thesis suggests therefore that both chemical and carbonate <b>looping</b> <b>cycles</b> have a high potential for efficient power generation, with or without carbon dioxide capture. The easiest process to integrate, from a technological aspect, may nevertheless be chemical looping combustion of synthesis gas...|$|R

The raw feed for cement production includes ~ 85 wt% limestone with the remaining material consisting of clay and additives (e.g. SiO2, Al2O3 etc.).

40|$|A high {{temperature}} solid <b>looping</b> <b>cycle</b> (HTSLC) {{is a type}} of chemical process carried out in twin reactor system. The hot solid particles are transferred from first reactor to second reactor and same particles are transferred back to the original reactor in the continuous and endless cyles. The purpose of the solid transfer is either to provide heat to carry out the desired reaction or to regenerate the particle reactivity. In some operations solid transport is required for both purposes. The calcium looping process, steam gasification process and chemical looping combustion are the examples of {{high temperature}} solid <b>looping</b> <b>cycles.</b> All these processes are well acknowledged for their potential in carbon capture development. Although these processes differ on the basis of chemistry, they require the use of same reactor system called dual fluidized bed (DFB) system. These HTSLCs are currently under the demonstration phase at pilot scale. A 200 kWth test plant is built at University of Stuttgart to demonstrate calcium looping and sorption enhanced reforming process.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{research on}} CO 2 capture by lime-based <b>looping</b> <b>cycles.</b> This {{is a new}} and promising technology that may help in mitigation of global warming and climate change caused primarily {{by the use of}} fossil fuels. The intensity of the anticipated changes urgently requires solutions such as the developing technologies for CO 2 capture, especially those based on CaO <b>looping</b> <b>cycles.</b> This technology is at the pilot plant demonstration stage and there are still significant challenges that require solutions. The technology is based on a dual fluidized bed reactor which contains a carbonator - a unit for CO 2 capture, and a calciner - a unit for CaO regeneration. The major technology components are well known from other technologies and easily applicable. However, even though CaO is a very good candidate as a solid CO 2 carrier, its performance in a practical system still has significant limitations. Thus, research on CaO performance is critical and this paper discusses some of the more important problems and potential solutions that are being examined at CETC-O...|$|R
