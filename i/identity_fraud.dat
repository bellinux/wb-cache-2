40|$|The {{growing problem}} offraudulent tax returns being {{submitted}} based on stolen identities is a 2 ̆ 2 tsunami offraud, 2 ̆ 2 and victims, lawmakers, {{and law enforcement}} are struggling with {{how to deal with}} the fallout. The issues surrounding <b>identity</b> theft-based tax <b>fraud</b> are complex. Current IRS efforts to stem the tide involve pouring resources into assisting victims, updating IRS processes to detect and prevent refund fraud, and increasing the number of criminal investigations and prosecutions it pursues. The IRS 2 ̆ 7 s approach and pending proposed legislation are not enough to address the problems created by <b>identity</b> theft-based tax <b>fraud.</b> This Article argues the IRS and Congress must use a holistic approach to attack this species of tax fraud. To that end, this Article supports enhanced criminal penalties and proposes new civil tax penalties aimed specifically at <b>identity</b> theft tax <b>fraud.</b> This Article pursues two goals. First, it documents and explains the problem of <b>identity</b> theft-based refund <b>fraud,</b> highlighting particular issues with respect to tax compliance. In so doing, it analyzes existing civil and criminal tax penalties to punish and deter identity thieves, an analysis which reveals that existing criminal penalties are insufficient and that there is no directly applicable existing civil penalty. Second, to address the gaps in existing law, the Article proposes standards for Congress to use in crafting a comprehensive penalty scheme to apply to <b>identity</b> theft-based refund <b>fraud.</b> This Article proceeds in three parts. Part II addresses the nature and scope of <b>identity</b> theft tax <b>fraud,</b> explaining the consequences such fraud has on tax administration, fair enforcement, and public confidence in voluntary compliance, which is the bedrock of our tax system. Part III explores the inadequacy of existing criminal and civil penalties. Part IV then proposes legislative action, evaluates proposed and pending legislation, and makes specific recommendations for enhanced criminal penalties and the creation of a new civil penalty aimed specifically at <b>identity</b> theft-based tax <b>fraud...</b>|$|R
