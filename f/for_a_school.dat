5|$|After {{the land}} had been surveyed, the first buyer was the Education Board, {{securing}} land <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>school</b> {{in the market}} square, and a teacher's house on the adjacent section. Both these buildings were also built in concrete and exist to this day. The school was built to a northern hemisphere design and has windows {{on the south side}} only to stop children from becoming distracted, but the windows are on the wrong side to utilise the sun. Since the school closed in 1938 it has been used for functions and as a hall. The former teacher's house is used as a bach. Both buildings are owned by Ashburton District Council.|$|E
5|$|An example {{may be a}} {{local school}} system in the United States. It {{receives}} {{a grant from the}} its local state government to support a new special education initiative, another grant from the federal government <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>school</b> lunch program, and an annuity to award teachers working on research projects. At periodic intervals, the school system needs to generate a report to the state about the special education program, a report to a federal agency about the school lunch program, and a report to another authority about the research program. Each of these programs has its own unique reporting requirements, so the school system needs a method to separately identify the related revenues and expenditures. This is done by establishing separate funds, each with its own chart of accounts.|$|E

40|$|Jensen and Vestergaard (2003) compare price {{regulation}} with quantity regulation under economic {{uncertainty in the}} spirit of Weitzman (1974). <b>For</b> <b>a</b> <b>schooling</b> fishery without search cost, they find that {{price regulation}} is preferred over quantity regulation, when demand for fish is elastic. However, this finding is based on an assumption that does not hold and, in fact; quantity regulation is always preferred for this type of fishery, irrespective of the demand elasticity. In this note, we show that a pro quota result always applies <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>schooling</b> fishery without search costs. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the conditions for}} generalizing the analysis in Weitzman (1974) to fisheries. It is shown that it is straightforward to generalize the analysis if the cost function is direct additively separable in stock size and catches. This leads {{to the conclusion that}} the analysis holds <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>schooling</b> fishery with and without search costs, but it might not hold <b>for</b> <b>a</b> search fishery. A further result is that <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>schooling</b> fishery without search costs, where the marginal cost function is steeper than the marginal benefit function, taxes are likely to be preferred over individual transferable quotas. ...|$|R

San Diego had to compete with Fresno, Los Angeles, and several other cities <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>school,</b> and its first attempt to establish one in 1895 was vetoed by California governor James Budd.
