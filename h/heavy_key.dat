6000|$|... "Beshrew the old fool!" [...] muttered Sir William Howe, growing {{impatient}} of her obstinacy {{and ashamed}} of the emotion into {{which he had been}} betrayed. [...] "She is the very moral of old-fashioned prejudice, and could exist nowhere but in this musty edifice.--Well, then, Mistress Dudley, since you will needs tarry, I give the province-house in charge to you. Take this key, and keep it safe until myself or some other royal governor shall demand it of you." [...] Smiling bitterly at himself and her, he took the <b>heavy</b> <b>key</b> of the province-house, and, delivering it into the old lady's hands, drew his clonk around him for departure.|$|E
60|$|She paused {{under the}} porch, and ere fitting the <b>heavy</b> <b>key</b> to the lock, felt that strange {{pressure}} and emotion {{of the heart}} that even if it be sorrow is also an exquisite sensation. If it were mournful that the one last office she could render to Humfrey was over, it was precious to her {{to be the only}} one who had a right to pay it, the one whom he had loved best upon earth, round whom she liked to believe that he still might be often hovering--whom he might welcome by and by.

50|$|Shipboard {{installations}} usually used a DC motor (usually {{run off the}} ship's DC lighting supply) {{to drive}} an alternator whose AC output was then stepped up to 10,000-14,000 volts by a transformer.

(Lower-powered units sometimes used the morse key to directly switch the AC, but this required a <b>heavier</b> <b>key</b> {{making it more difficult}} to operate).|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile, Lawrence and Lambourne {{rolled on}} the floor of the apartment, closely grappled together. Neither had, happily, {{opportunity}} to draw their daggers; but Lawrence found space enough to clash his <b>heavy</b> <b>keys</b> across Michael's face, and Michael in return grasped the turnkey so felly by the throat that the blood gushed from nose and mouth, so that they were both gory and filthy spectacles when one of the other officers of the household, attracted by the noise of the fray, entered the room, and with some difficulty effected the separation of the combatants.|$|R
60|$|There {{was little}} more to do than to cross the street, and Sir Edmund hurried her through the flagged and dirty yard, and the dim, foul hall, filled with fumes of smoke and beer, where melancholy debtors held out their hands, idle scapegraces laughed, heavy {{degraded}} faces scowled, and evil sounds were heard, {{up the stairs to}} a nail-studded door, where Anne shuddered to hear the <b>heavy</b> <b>key</b> turned by the coarse, rude-looking warder, only withheld from insolence by the presence of a magistrate. Her escort tarried outside, and she saw Charles, his rush-light candle gleaming on his gold lace as he {{wrote a letter to the}} ambassador to be forwarded by his father.|$|E
60|$|Smiling bitterly {{at himself}} and her, {{he took the}} <b>heavy</b> <b>key</b> of the Province House, and {{delivering}} it into the old lady's hands, drew his cloak around him for departure. As the General glanced back at Esther Dudley's antique figure, he deemed her well fitted for such a charge, as being so perfect {{a representative of the}} decayed past--of an age gone by, with its manners, opinions, faith and feelings, all fallen into oblivion or scorn--of what had once been a reality, but was now merely a vision of faded magnificence. Then Sir William Howe strode forth, smiting his clinched hands together, in the fierce anguish of his spirit; and old Esther Dudley was left to keep watch in the lonely Province House, dwelling there with memory; and if Hope ever seemed to flit around her, still was it Memory in disguise.|$|E
60|$|So on the {{following}} morning shortly after sunrise Hugh and Grey Dick, guided by David, took boat and rowed through most fearful scenes and sounds to the Palazzo Cattrina, a splendid but somewhat dilapidated building situated {{in a part of}} the city that, like itself, had seen more prosperous times. The great doors of the place set in a marble archway stood half open. Over them were cut the cognizance of the floating swan, and beneath, in letters of faded gold, the titles of Acour, de Noyon, and Cattrina. No wonder they were open, since the porter's lodge was occupied only by a grisly corpse that lay rotting on the floor, a <b>heavy</b> <b>key</b> in its hand. The courtyard beyond was empty and so, save for a dead horse, were the stables to the right. Passing up the steps of the hall that also stood open, they entered.|$|E

60|$|The {{patients}} were a wondrous lot, and told eloquently of human carelessness. Here were found letters containing articles that no envelope of mere paper {{could be expected}} to hold--such as bunches of <b>heavy</b> <b>keys,</b> articles of jewellery, etcetera, which had already more than half escaped from their covers. There were also frail cardboard boxes, so squeezed and burst that their contents were protruding, and parcels containing worsted and articles of wearing apparel, which had been so carelessly put up as to have come undone in the mail-bags. All these things were being re-tied, re-folded, patched up here and there with sealing-wax, or put into new covers, by the postal surgeons, and done with as much care, too, as though the damage had been caused by the Post-Office rather than by carelessness in the public.|$|R

60|$|It was in vain that De Catinat raved and threatened, {{invoking the}} most terrible menaces upon all who were {{concerned}} in detaining him. Two stout knaves thrusting him from behind and one dragging in front forced him through a narrow gate and along a stone-flagged passage, a small man in black buckram {{with a bunch of}} keys {{in one hand and a}} swinging lantern in the other leading the way. Their ankles had been so tied that they could but take steps of a foot in length. Shuffling along, they made their way down three successive corridors and through three doors, each of which was locked and barred behind them. Then they ascended a winding stone stair, hollowed out in the centre by the feet of generations of prisoners and of jailers, and finally they were thrust into a small square dungeon, and two trusses of straw were thrown in after them. An instant later a <b>heavy</b> <b>key</b> turned in the lock, and they were left to their own meditations.|$|E
60|$|And Esther Dudley fancied {{that as soon}} as {{the wide}} door should be flung open all the pomp and splendor of bygone times would pace majestically into the province-house and the gilded {{tapestry}} of the past would be brightened by the sunshine of the present.

Advancing up the court-yard appeared a person of most dignified mien, with tokens, as Esther interpreted them, of gentle blood, high rank and long-accustomed authority even in his walk and every gesture. He was richly dressed, but wore a gouty shoe, which, however, did not lessen the stateliness of his gait. Around and behind him were people in plain civic dresses and two or three war-worn veterans--evidently officers of rank--arrayed in a uniform of blue and buff. But Esther Dudley, firm in the belief that had fastened its roots about her heart, beheld only the principal personage, and never doubted that this was the long-looked-for governor to whom she was to surrender up her charge.

She set the mansion in the best order that her means allowed, and, arraying herself in silks and tarnished gold, stood long before the blurred mirror to admire her own magnificence. As she gazed the gray and withered lady moved her ashen lips, murmuring half aloud, talking to shapes that she saw within the mirror, to shadows of her own fantasies, to the household friends of memory, and bidding them rejoice with her and come forth to meet the governor. And while absorbed in this communion Mistress Dudley heard the tramp of many footsteps in the street, and, looking out at the window, beheld what she construed as the royal governor's arrival.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Identification of {{significant}} patterns in network traffic, such as IPs or flows that contribute large volume (heavy hitters) or introduce large changes (heavy changers), has many applications in accounting and network anomaly detection. As network speed {{and the number}} of flows grow rapidly, tracking per-IP or per-flow statistics becomes infeasible due to both the computational overhead and memory requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel sequential hashing scheme that requires only O(H log N) both in memory and computational overhead that are close to being optimal, where N is the the number of all possible keys (e. g., flows, IPs) and H is the maximum number of <b>heavy</b> <b>keys.</b> Moreover, the generalized sequential hashing scheme makes it possible to trade off among memory, update cost, and detection cost in a large range that can be utilized by different computer architectures for optimizing the overall performance. In addition, we also propose statistically efficient algorithms for estimating the values of heavy hitters and heavy changers. Using both theoretical analysis and experimental studies of Internet traces, we demonstrate that our approach can achieve the same accuracy as the existing methods do but using much less memory and computational overhead.
