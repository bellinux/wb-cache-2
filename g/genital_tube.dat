50|$|The {{number of}} visible Chrysidid {{segments}} varies among subfamilies. Chrysis ignita has three segmented abdomens in both sexes, which make sex determination difficult. The morphology of the abdominal anatomy translates into defensive function for the wasp. The visible segments are heavily sclerotized and weakly intermusclated. The abdominal segments I through IV possess spiracles, which the wasp breathes through. The chrysidid stinger is essentially nonfunctional, having {{been reduced to}} an ovipositor in females and a <b>genital</b> <b>tube</b> in males.|$|E
5000|$|We {{have still}} {{to notice the}} larger works, on which the author's claim to {{distinction}} chiefly rests. Papers on the Coleoptera of the Hawaiian Islands had been published by the Entom. Soc. of London in 1878, 1879 and 1880. These were followed in 1899 and 1908 by the Fauna Hawaiiensis brought out by the Royal Society. Of even more importance is the Beetles of Central America, prepared chiefly from material collected by Godman and Salvin, and published in 1894 and later years in that monumental work known as the [...] "Fauna Centrali-Americana". In 1895 appeared {{the first volume of}} the Insecta in the Cambridge Natural History, this being followed by the second volume in 1899. Of their influence on the advancement of entomology, and especially of our knowledge of insects as living things, too much cannot be said. Their enormous sale has prevented the appearance of a new edition, which their author would have liked to bring out. One point especially which he wished to emend was the classification of insects into Natural Orders, his views and suggestions on which will be found in the paper in the Entomologist to which reference has already been made. In 1910 the Insecta was translated into Russian by N. Y. Kuznetsov. In 1912 the Entom. Soc. of London, {{with the assistance of the}} Royal Society, brought out as Part III of the Transactions The Comparative Anatomy of the Male <b>Genital</b> <b>Tube</b> in Coleoptera by Sharp & Muir, an exhaustive treatise of 166 pages, and 37 plates. All the families were examined, and the results of the multitudinous dissections are given in detail. This work is of first-rate importance.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{phylogeny}} of {{a number}} of diverse, tropical Australian lineages has been studied recently {{to lay the groundwork for}} biogeographic analyses. As part of this effort, we present here a cladistic analysis of the Australasian Coelometopini (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae: Coelometopinae). A total of 101 morphological characters were coded for 50 taxa. Results show that the Australasian Coelometopini comprises several well-supported clades and that the majority of flightless species from Australian high elevation rainforests form a single monophyletic group. Features of the female <b>genital</b> <b>tube</b> and ovipositor were especially useful in determining close relationship within the tribe. The Coelometopini has been redefined over recent years, and we synthesize and summarize the biology and ecology of the group taking into account the most current circumscription...|$|E

40|$|Aim. Distribution, {{habitats}} and morphological variability of two subspecies of the endemic Caucasian species Blaps scabriuscula Ménétriés, 1832 are {{considered in the}} paper. Results and main conclusions. Nominotypical subspecies is very rare and inhabits deserts of eastern Azerbaijan (Gobustan). The subspecies Blaps scabriuscula subalpina is distributed in the Eastern and the Central Caucasus and inhabits steppe and alpine landscapes to 3000 m. Several morphological forms are separated from the Central (North Ossetia, Kabardino-Balkaria, KarachayCherkessia) and the Eastern Caucasus (Chechnya, Dagestan, southern slopes of the Big Caucasus from Azerbaijan to Georgia – Khevsureti). Blaps scabriuscula subalpina is found in Rostov-on-Don (the first record for Rostov Region) in sandy soil meadow during building works. Rostov population is morphologically differs from Caucasian populations of the species. It is assumed that this record {{is associated with the}} ancient human migrations because of many representatives of this species-group (B. mortisaga (Linnaeus, 1758), B. puella Allard, 1880, B. scabriuscula, B. kovali Abdurakhmanov, Nabozhenko, 2011) have a propensity to synanthropy. Morphological description of Rostov population and differential characters of Caucasian populations are given. Female <b>genital</b> <b>tubes</b> of different populations of B. scabriuscula are described and figured for the first time.

30|$|The {{fallopian tube}} cancers {{constitute}} 0.3 % {{of the female}} <b>genital</b> cancers. Mainly, <b>tube</b> cancers are seen in {{women between the ages}} of 55 and 60. Nearly all cancers are of epithelial origin and generally of serous histological type [2]. Fallopian tube MMMTs constitute less than 1 % of genital sarcomas. They may include homologous or heterologous components as sarcomatous elements. Condromatose areas, as in our study, are generally determined as heterologous structures in these tumors [1]. The tumor spread at the time of diagnosis and the residual tumor volume after the surgery have been shown as the most important prognostic factors [4].|$|R
40|$|Microsurgery is the {{treatment}} of choice for most patients with a tubal factor. In-vitro fertilization-embryo transfer (TVF-ET) is performed in patients with the so-called classical indications: bilateral salpingectomy and tubal damage which is not correctable by means of microsurgery. We also discuss FVF in patients who have not conceived within 1 to 2 years following microsurgery. In women with tubal re-occlusion FVF should be performed. In patients with patent tubes following microsurgery, gamete intra-Fallopian transfer (GUT) forms part of a controlled clinical study. More clinical experience can perhaps solve the dilemma whether it is beneficial to perform GIFT or to offer IVF primarily to these patients. In patients with andrological infertility, GIFT is offered after six unsuccessful attempts of intrauterine insemination (IUI). In long-standing infertility, GIFT is performed when IUI with ovarian stimulation fails. Patients with <b>genital</b> pathology (patent <b>tubes)</b> are treated with GIFT unless it is not technically feasible. In these cases microsurgery or FVF should be discussed.

40|$|A primate {{model of}} chlamydial pelvic in¯ammatory disease {{was used to}} {{characterize}} serum antibody responses to the 60 kDa chlamydial heat shock protein (CHSP 60). Forty monkeys were infected in the fallopian tubes with Chlamydia trachomatis and then were treated. Twenty-three (58 %) monkeys developed antibodies against CHSP 60, of whom 6 (15 %) had CHSP 60 responses that persisted throughout the study and 17 (42. 5 %) had a transient response. A persistent CHSP 60 antibody response was correlated with being culture- or ligase chain re-action±positive in the fallopian tubes (), {{but not in the}} cervix pretreatment, and withP 5. 004 being tubal-positive posttreatment (). Compared with tubal-negative monkeys, tubal-P 5. 02 positive monkeys had more intense CHSP 60 responses () that lasted longer (P 5. 006 P 5). Among CHSP 60 responders, an was correlated with more severe salpingeal. 002 OD 1 0. 5 pathology before treatment ().

40|$|SummaryBackgroundLittle {{is known}} about multidrug-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (MDRP) {{outbreaks}} in long-term care facilities (LTCFs). AimTo describe an MDRP outbreak in an LTCF and to clarify risk factors for MDRP acquisition. MethodsPatients who were positive for MDRP at an LTCF from January 2013 to January 2014 were analysed. A descriptive analysis, a case–control study, and a microbiological analysis were performed. FindingsA total of 23 MDRP cases were identified, 16 of which were confirmed in sputum samples. Healthcare workers were observed violating hand hygiene procedures when performing oral, wound, and <b>genital</b> care. Nasogastric <b>tube</b> and oxygen mask use was associated with MDRP acquisition in the respiratory tract, {{which might have been}} confounded by poor hand hygiene. Sharing unhygienic devices, such as portable oral suction devices for oral care, and washing bottles and ointments for wound and genital care with inadequate disinfection could explain the transmission of MDRP in some cases. Isolates from 11 patients were found to be indistinguishable or closely related by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and harbouring the blaGES- 5 gene. Subsequent enhanced infection control measures were supported by nearby hospitals and a local public health centre. No additional cases were identified for a year after the last case occurred in January 2014. ConclusionAn outbreak of MDRP with an antimicrobial resistance gene, blaGES- 5, occurred in a Japanese LTCF. It was successfully controlled by enhanced infection control measures, which neighbouring hospitals and a local public health centre supported...|$|R
40|$|Gonorrhea {{is a set}} of {{clinical}} conditions resulting from infection with the sexually-acquired bacterial pathogen Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Acquisition may involve multiple mucosal sites in the lower female genital tract, including the urethra, cervix, Bartholin’s and Skene’s glands, as well as the anorectal canal, pharynx, and conjunctivae. It may spread to the upper <b>genital</b> tract, uterine <b>tubes,</b> abdominal cavity, and other systemic sites. Gonorrhea is the second most commonly reported sexually-transmitted infection in the US and rates are higher among women than men. Women and infants are affected disproportionately by gonorrhea, because early infection may be asymptomatic and also because extension of infection is often associated with serious sequelae. Screening is critical for infection identification and the prevention or limitation of upper genital tract spread, and horizontal and vertical transmission. Routine genital screening is recommended annually for all sexually active women at risk for infection, including women aged < 25 years and older women with {{one or more of the}} following risks: a previous gonorrhea infection, the presence of other sexually transmitted diseases, new or multiple sex partners, inconsistent condom use, commercial sex work, drug use, or human immunodeficiency virus infection with sexual activity or pregnancy. Pharyngeal gonococcal infections are common in adolescents, and direct culture screening is necessary to identify affected individuals. Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) are considered the standard for screening and diagnosis. Although urine NAAT testing is most commonly used, there is growing support for vaginal swabs collected by providers or patients themselves. Resistance to all antibiotics currently recommended for the treatment of gonorrhea has been documented and complicates therapeutic strategies.
