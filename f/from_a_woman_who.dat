However, Robert Brownell, in his analysis Marriage of Inconvenience, argues that Ruskin's difficulty with the marriage was financial and related to concerns that Effie and her less-affluent family were trying to tap into Ruskin's considerable wealth.|$|E

2500|$|Palmer {{edited and}} rewrote the manuscript, {{increasing}} the {{total word count}} to a novella length of 31,000.

The issue sold out, and generated quite a response: between 1945 and 1949, many letters arrived attesting to the truth of Shaver's claims (tens of thousands of letters, according to Palmer). The correspondents claimed that they, too, had heard strange voices or encountered denizens of the Hollow Earth. One of the letters to Amazing Stories was <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> claimed to have gone into a deep subbasement of a Paris, France building via a secret elevator. After months of rape and other torture, the woman was freed by a benevolent Tero. Another letter claiming involvement with Deros came from Fred Crisman, later to gain notoriety {{for his role in the}} Maury Island Incident and the John F. Kennedy Assassination. [...] "Shaver Mystery Club" [...] societies were created in several cities.
