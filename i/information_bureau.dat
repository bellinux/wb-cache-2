He started his career by designing a small hovercraft, but remained unconvinced by his choice of a job at DRDO. Kalam was also part of the INCOSPAR committee working under Vikram Sarabhai, the renowned space scientist. In 1969, Kalam was transferred to the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) where he was the project director of India's first Satellite Launch Vehicle (SLV-III) which successfully deployed the Rohini satellite in near-earth orbit in July 1980; Kalam had first started work on an expandable rocket project independently at DRDO in 1965. In 1969, Kalam received the government's approval and expanded the programme to include more engineers.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{is based on}} the observation that people in the service industry is being replaced by technology.   This insight formed a foundation for the presentation of the problem this essay is based upon. We began to speculate over how tourist <b>information</b> <b>bureaus</b> handle the changes, regarding information technology, in their surroundings when their main task is to inform and communicate with their market. Information technology has created new possibilities for organizations to reach their consumers and it has influenced all kinds of industries. We decided to examine organizations in the tourism sector because {{it is one of the}} biggest and fastest growing industries in the world. The entering of information technology in the tourism industry has changed its structure and we want to examine how tourist <b>information</b> <b>bureaus</b> succeed to deal with this phenomenon. The aim with this essay is to examine how and to what extent tourist <b>information</b> <b>bureaus</b> integrate with changes in their surroundings caused by information technology and which values that slip away/ is added by the adaption. To accomplish this we have interviewed six persons representing the tourist <b>information</b> <b>bureaus</b> in Färjestaden, Kalmar, Tranemo, Visby and Norrköping. By applying the empirical material, which we gathered through interviews, on theory we wanted to create a deeper understanding in how an organization can handle changes in their surroundings, created by information technology. Both the theoretical and the empirical chapter are divided into two main parts, “Information technology” and “Organizational fit”. The conclusion of the {{research is}} described in the analyze and discussion chapter. ...|$|R
5|$|After {{both the}} British Industrial Syndicalist Education League (ISEL), a {{short-lived}} syndicalist organization {{heavily involved in}} the strike wave in Britain from 1910, and the Dutch syndicalist union National Labor Secretariat (NAS) published proposals for an international syndicalist congress in 1913, the FVdG {{was the first to}} express support. There were difficulties in organizing the congress, and the largest syndicalist union worldwide— the CGT— refused to participate because it was already affiliated with the social democratic International Federation of Trade Unions. Despite these challenges, the First International Syndicalist Congress took place at Holborn Town Hall in London from September 27 to October 2. British, Swedish, Danish, Dutch, Belgian, French, Spanish, Italian, Cuban, Brazilian, and Argentine organizations—both labor unions and political groups— had delegates in London in addition to the FVdG, which was represented by Karl Roche, Carl Windhoff, and Fritz Kater. There were also links with Norwegian, Polish, and American groups. Kater was elected co-president of the congress alongside Jack Wills. After Wills was forced to resign, Kater served as co-president with Jack Tanner. The congress had difficulty agreeing on many issues, the main source of conflict being whether further schisms in the European labor movement (as had occurred in Germany and the Netherlands) should be risked. The FVdG generally agreed with their Dutch comrades in calling on other unions to decide between syndicalism and socialism, while their Italian, French, and Spanish counterparts, most notably Alceste De Ambris of the Italian USI, were more intent on preventing further division. Accordingly, the congress was divided {{on the question of whether}} its purpose was to simply pave the way for deeper relations between the syndicalist unions or whether a Syndicalist International was to be founded. The opponents of a new organization prevailed, but the congress agreed to establish an <b>Information</b> <b>Bureau.</b> The <b>Information</b> <b>Bureau</b> was based in Amsterdam and published the Bulletin international du mouvement syndicaliste. The congress was considered a success by most who attended, with the notable exception of De Ambris. A second congress was scheduled to take place in two years' time in Amsterdam. Due to the outbreak of World War I, the congress did not take place. The Bulletin only published for eighteen issues before the war caused it to cease publication.|$|E

When individuals wrote to the Bureau to inquire if their relative had been taken prisoner, it appears that the Bureau provided a reply which neither confirmed or denied whether the man was a prisoner. Although the Bureau's role included facilitating mail between POWs and their families, this was not carried out as the families were not notified and few POWs wrote home. The lack of communication with their families increased the POWs feelings of being cut off from Japanese society.|$|E

In the Soviet Union, {{foreign intelligence}} was formally formed in 1920, as a foreign department of Cheka (Inostrannyj Otdiel—INO). Soviet intelligence services were formed during the Russian Civil War of 1918–1920. On December 19, 1918, the Central Committee Bureau of the Russian Communist Party (Bolshevik) had decided to combine front formations of Cheka and the Military Control Units, which were controlled by the Military Revolutionary Committee, and responsible for counter-intelligence activities, into one organ which was named Special Section (department) of Cheka. The head of the Special Section (department) was Mikhail Sergeyevich Kedrov. The task of the Special Section was to run human intelligence: to gather political and military intelligence behind enemy lines, and expose and neutralize counter-revolutionary elements in the Red Army. At the beginning of 1920, in Cheka's Special Section there was an under section named War <b>Information</b> <b>Bureau</b> (WIB) which conducted political, military, scientific and technical intelligence in surrounding countries.

Hoxha was threatened {{on the basis of his}} opposition to the pro-Yugoslav line, as Xoxe's final goal was to overthrow Hoxha and to incorporate Albania into Yugoslavia as its Seventh Republic. The Soviet–Yugoslav split in 1948, however, had allowed Albania to break from Yugoslav dominance, and it became the first state to side with the <b>Information</b> <b>Bureau</b> (better known in the West as the Cominform) with its resolution attacking the Yugoslav leadership for allegedly pursuing a road of nationalist deviation and capitalist restoration. From that point onwards relations between Albania and the Soviet Union [...] "remained quite close until March 5, 1953," [...] when Stalin died. In the words of historian Nicholas C. Pano, [...] "by the beginning of 1949, Albania had progressed from the status of a sub-satellite to that of a full-fledged satellite of the Soviet Union."

[...] On May 25 the Central Committee of the Party of Labour sent a letter to its Soviet counterpart stating among other things that, [...] "In our opinion such a hasty (and ill-considered) decision on an issue of great importance and of principle" [...] was conducted [...] "without first making a profound analysis together with all the parties interested in this issue." [...] With only Albania among the Eastern Bloc states opposing Khrushchev's move, the Soviets succeeded in unilaterally rehabilitating Tito's standing within the international communist movement and apologized for past Soviet activities in relation to Yugoslavia.|$|E
