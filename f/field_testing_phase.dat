50|$|Field testing, or beta testing, is done {{by those}} who can provide {{valuable}} feedback on the product. This usually lasts {{a long period of}} time and the participants can include customers, partners, or anyone who is not familiar with the producing company. At this juncture the product fully resembles its planned launch version in all aspects; therefore the participants' interaction rate will be higher because they know all the features and benefits. During this phase there are three primary objectives to be achieved. The first objective is to see how much the participant is interested. It is also worthwhile to note which individual attribute they prefer and if they would buy the product. Next, determine how the customer uses the product and evaluate its durability. Confirm the environment in which the customers will be using the product. Recording and analyzing customer feedback is the final step in the <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> <b>phase.</b> This feedback may be used to help inform any minor design improvements that need to be made. The sales and marketing team will also be a beneficiary of field testing feedback; they can use this information to help focus their sales presentation.|$|E

40|$|Melanoma is an {{increasingly}} common skin cancer worldwide. Recent treatment advances have provided patients and healthcare professionals (HCPs) with choices where {{quality of life}} (QoL) and toxicity are important considerations. A melanoma-specific QoL questionnaire is being developed in a cross-cultural setting using a four phase process developed by the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Group. In phase 1, a literature search identified a list of pertinent QoL issues; this was shown to HCPs and patients in eight countries and rated for importance and relevance. Questions were constructed for the highest-rated issues (phase 2) and piloted in another patient sample (phase 3). Using EORTC Quality of Life Group criteria and sequential use of factor and Rasch analysis, scales were hypothesized for <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> (<b>phase</b> 4). Seven QoL domains (disease symptoms, treatment issues, financial issues, access/quality of information, satisfaction with care, psychosocial issues and support), comprising 73 QoL issues, were rated by 46 HCPs and 78 patients. Fifty-six issues were rephrased as questions and piloted with 132 patients. A 38 -item questionnaire (QLQ-MEL 38) is available for field testing {{in conjunction with the}} EORTC QLQ-C 30. This study has shown that melanoma patients have important QoL issues that have been incorporated into a new cross-culturally validated instrument.

40|$|Purpose A {{significant}} proportion of oncological patients ex-periences lack of appetite. Precise measurement is relevant to improve the management of lack of appetite. The so-called computer-adaptive test (CAT) allows for adaptation of the questionnaire to the individual patient, thereby optimizing measurement precision. The EORTC Quality of Life Group is developing a CAT version of the widely used EORTC QLQ-C 30 questionnaire. Here, {{we report on the}} development of the lack of appetite CAT. Methods The EORTC approach to CAT development com-prises four phases: literature search, operationalization, pre-testing, and field testing. Phases 1 – 3 are described in this paper. First, a list of items was retrieved from the literature. This was refined, deleting redundant and irrelevant items. Next, new items fitting the “QLQ-C 30 item style ” were cre-ated. These were evaluated by international samples of experts and cancer patients. Results The literature search generated a list of 146 items. After a comprehensive item selection procedure, the list was reduced to 24 items. These formed the basis for 21 new items fitting the QLQ-C 30 item style. Expert evaluations (n= 10) and patient interviews (n= 49) reduced the list to 12 lack of appetite items. Conclusions Phases 1 – 3 resulted in 12 lack of appetite candi-date items. Based on a <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> (<b>phase</b> 4), the psychomet-ric characteristics of the items will be assessed and the final item bank will be generated.

40|$|Abstract Background Many {{people with}} {{dementia}} experience anxiety, {{which can lead}} to decreased independence, relationship difficulties and increased admittance to care homes. Anxiety is often treated with antipsychotic medication, which has limited efficacy and serious side effects. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is widely used to treat anxiety in a range of populations, yet no RCTs on CBT for anxiety in dementia exist. This study aims to develop a CBT for anxiety in dementia manual and to determine its feasibility in a pilot RCT. Methods/design Phase I involves the development of a CBT for anxiety in dementia manual, through a process of (1) focus groups, (2) comprehensive literature reviews, (3) expert consultation, (4) a consensus conference and (5) <b>field</b> <b>testing.</b> <b>Phase</b> II involves the evaluation of the manual with 50 participants with mild to moderate dementia and anxiety (and their carers) in a pilot, two-armed RCT. Participants will receive either ten sessions of CBT or treatment as usual. Primary outcome measures are anxiety and costs. Secondary outcome measures are participant quality of life, behavioural disturbance, cognition, depression, mood and perceived relationship with the carer, and carer mood and perceived relationship with the person with dementia. Measures will be administered at baseline, 15 weeks and 6 months. Approximately 12 qualitative interviews will be used to gather service-users' perspectives on the intervention. Discussion This study aims to determine the feasibility of CBT for people with anxiety and dementia and provide data on the effect size of the intervention in order to conduct a power analysis for a definitive RCT. The manual will be revised according to qualitative and quantitative findings. Its publication will enable its availability throughout the NHS and beyond.

40|$|M. A. This study {{serves to}} expand the work of A. C. Faul on scale {{development}} in social work to incorporate the demand for multiculturalism. Ecometrics – the measurement of ecosystems – is a steadily growing field in South Africa. To date, however, scale development has assumed that the ecometrics will be practiced in a monocultural context. This is obviously {{not the case in}} South Africa. Consequently, the research goal is to design a process model for the development of social work scales for multicultural use in South Africa. As a secondary objective, the study aims to test this model in practice, through the development of a multicultural scale that accurately measures the social health of military employees/families. A number of issues underlying the technical aspects of multicultural scale development are first explored, including issues of the characteristics of ecometrics; the meaning of the term culture; the emic-etic debate; cultural equivalence; and bias, fairness and standards in ecometrics. Thereafter, a process model for the development of multicultural ecometric scales is introduced and five main phases are described: analysis, design, development, evaluation, and diffusion & adoption. Each of these phases is further decomposed into main moments and steps, each of which is described at both theoretical and technical levels. In order to test this process model in the real world, a new multicultural, multilingual, multidimensional, systems-oriented, salutogenic scale was created, called the Military Social Health Index. In the analysis phase, the need for the scale was analysed and the innovation requirements determined and contracted with the client. A theoretical framework – family resilience theory – was identified and explored, resulting in the development of an assessment model that underlies the scale. The cross-cultural comparability of the constructs was assessed and each construct was operationally defined, using facet maps. In the design phase, a multicultural, multilingual team of social workers generated close to 200 items, as well as instructions, using a multifocus approach, in which items were generated in four languages simultaneously (English, Zulu, Setswana and Afrikaans). Only items that could be expressed equivalently across languages were accepted. This resulted in an initial instrument, comprising 175 items (plus 16 demographic items), covering seven constructs, in four languages, at an average reading level of Grades 6 - 7. During the development (or <b>field</b> <b>testing)</b> <b>phase,</b> the instrument was reviewed by a group of social workers for content relevance, translation equivalence, item formulation, etc. Thereafter it was reviewed by focus groups of soldiers in the SANDF.

As the overall strategy, the 11 work packages (WPs) of the work plan were grouped into 3 key phases: (1) RD basis for cost-effective sensor development, (2) Sensor development, sensor web platform and integration, and (3) Field testing. In the first two phases, partners involved in WP 1 and WP 2 have provided a general understanding and integrated basis for a cost effective sensors development. Within the following WPs 4 to 8 the new sensors were created and integrated into different identified platforms. During the third phase of field testing (WP 9), partners have deployed precompetitive prototypes at chosen platforms (e. g. research vessels, oil platforms, buoys and submerged moorings, ocean racing yachts, drifting buoys). Starting from August 2015 (month 22; task 9. 2), these platforms have allowed the partnership to test the adaptability and performance of the in-situ sensors and verify if the transmission of data is properly made, correcting deviations. In task 9. 1 all stakeholders identified in WP 2 have been contacted in order to agree upon a coordinated agenda for the <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> <b>phase</b> for each of the platforms. Field testing procedures (WP 2) and deployment specificities, defined during sensor development in WPs 4 to 8, have been closely studied by all stakeholders involved in field testing activities in order for everyone to know their role, how to proceed and to provide themselves with the necessary material and equipment (e. g. transport of instruments). All this information have provided the basis for designing and coordinating field testing activities. Subsequently, the available new sensors have been tested since August 2015 till mid-October of the current year (2016) as part of task 9. 2, following the indications defined in D 9. 1, such as the intercomparison of the new sensors with commercial ones, when possible. The availability of new sensors was quite different in time starting with the first tests in September and October 2015 on noise, nutrient and heavy metals sensors and closing with pCO 2 in late September 2016. Sensors are technically fully described in the deliverables of WPs 3 to 8 and are here just mentioned where necessary. For further details, please consider those reports.

In task 9. 1 all stakeholders identified in WP 2, and other relevant agents, have been contacted in order to close a coordinated agenda for the <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> <b>phase</b> for each of the platforms. Field testing procedures (WP 2) and deployment specificities, defined during sensor development in WPs 4 to 8, are closely studied by all stakeholders involved in field testing activities in order for everyone to know their role, how to proceed and to provide themselves with the necessary material and equipment (e. g. transport of instruments). All this information will provide the basis for designing and coordinating field testing activities. Type and characteristics of the system (vessel or mooring, surface or deep, open sea or coastal area, duration, etc.), used for the field testing activities, are planned comprising the indicators included in the above-mentioned descriptors, taking into account that they must of interest for eutrophication, concentration of contaminants, marine litter and underwater noise. In order to obtain the necessary information, two tables were realized starting from the information acquired for D 2. 2 delivered in June 2014. One table was created for sensor developers and one for those partners that will test the sensors at sea. The six developers in COMMON SENSE have provided information on the seven sensors: CEFAS and IOPAN for underwater noise; IDRONAUT and LEITAT for microplastics; CSIC for an innovative piro and piezo resistive polymeric temperature and pressure and for heavy metal; DCU for the eutrophication sensor. This information is anyway incomplete because in most cases the novel sensors are still far to be ready and will be developed over the course of COMMON SENSE. So the sensors cannot be clearly designed yet and, consequently, technical characteristics cannot still be perfectly defined. This produces some lag in the acquired information and, consequently, in the planning of their testing on specific platforms that will be solved in the near future. In the table for Testers, partners have provided information on fifteen available platforms. Specific answers have been given on number and type of sensors on each platforms, their availability and technical characteristics, compatibility issues and, very important when new sensors are tested, comparative measurements to be implemented to verify them. Finally IOPAN has described two more platforms, a motorboat not listed in the DoW, but already introduced in D 2. 2, and their oceanographic buoy in the Gdansk Bay that was previously unavailable. The same availability now is present for the OBSEA Underwater observatory from CSIC, while their Aqualog undulating mooring is still not ready for use. In the following months, new information on sensors and platforms will be provided and the planning of testing activities will improve. Further updates of this report will be therefore necessary in order to individuate the most suitable platforms to test each kind of sensor.

40|$|The {{results of}} the {{research}} project show that solar cookers can be introduced and distributed successfully in countries with severe problems {{in the field of}} energy (firewood) supply. However, a precondition is that these solar cookers are adjusted {{to the needs of the}} corresponding user group. The most important adjustments are: The users must be able to prepare their traditional meals with solar cookers without having to change their cooking habits. The handling of solar cookers must be simple and without any risks. Another important aspect for the acceptance and distribution of solar cookers is the acquisition price of the systems. The manufacturing of solar cookers in these countries is essential for the reduction of the acquisition price. This would be a possible solution in several countries.

These new CAT measures are conceptualised to reflect the same constructs as the QLQ-C 30 scales. Accordingly, the Fatigue-CAT is intended to capture physical and general fatigue. Methods The EORTC approach to CAT development comprises four phases (literature search, operationalisation, pre-testing, and <b>field</b> <b>testing).</b> <b>Phases</b> I-III are described in detail in this paper. A literature search for fatigue items was performed in major medical databases. After refinement through several expert panels, the remaining items were {{used as the basis}} for adapting items and/or formulating new items fitting the EORTC item style. To obtain feedback from patients with cancer, these English items were translated into Danish, French, German, and Spanish and tested in the respective countries. Results Based on the literature search a list containing 588 items was generated. After a comprehensive item selection procedure focusing on content, redundancy, item clarity and item difficulty a list of 44 fatigue items was generated. Patient interviews (n = 52) resulted in 12 revisions of wording and translations. Discussion The item list developed in phases I-III will be further investigated within a field-testing phase (IV) to examine psychometric characteristics and to fit an item response theory model. The Fatigue CAT based on this item bank will provide scores that are backward-compatible to the original QLQ-C 30 fatigue scale...|$|R
40|$|In our {{paper we}} {{describe}} a 3 -D vision system designed and constructed at the Technical Research Centre of Finland in co- operation with the University of Oulu. The main application fields our 3 -D vision system {{was developed for}} are geometric measurements of large objects and manipulator and robot control tasks. It seems to be potential in automatic vehicle guidance applications, too. The system has now been operative for about one year and its performance has been extensively tested. Recently we have started a <b>field</b> <b>test</b> <b>phase</b> to evaluate its performance in real industrial tasks and environments. The system consists of three main units: the range finder, the scanner and the computer. The range finder {{is based on the}} direct measurement of the time-of- flight of a laser pulse. The time-interval between the transmitted and the received light pulses is converted into a continuous analog voltage, which is amplified, filtered and offset-corrected to produce the range information. The scanner consists of two mirrors driven by moving iron galvanometers. This system is controlled by servo amplifiers. The computer unit controls the scanner, transforms the measured coordinates into a cartesian coordinate system and serves as a user interface and postprocessing environment. Methods for segmenting the range image into a higher level description have been developed. The description consists of planar and curved surfaces and their features and relations. Parametric surface representations based on the Ferguson surface patch are studied, too. 1...|$|R

The problem addressed in this study is the development of a placement instrument using the Rasch Model to accomplish (1) the placement of students into beginning technical math courses, and (2) the comparison between student cohorts entering Technology and the Arts and Sciences. To accomplish the first task, test results from a total of over 900 students were examined in the test construction and the <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> <b>phases.</b> Cutoff scores were established and data were collected over a period of three semesters to establish field validity. Item measure drift was observed over this same time interval to find the stability of the items. The test was constructed with distinct arithmetic and algebra sections. This had the advantage that the test could also be re-examined as two individual tests. On the whole, the Rasch Model fits the population although it fits the Technology cohort better than the Arts and Sciences cohort. Comparison of the cohorts was accomplished by a series of hypotheses tests. The two cohorts are different. Arts and Sciences students scored significantly higher on the test. Examination of subtests showed both cohorts scoring comparably on the arithmetic part, but not on the algebra part. It is performance on algebra that distinguishes the two cohorts. The two cohorts differ in other respects. The extensive demographic description of the two cohorts presented shows average age, employment, sex, and other differences between the groups. This facet of information should not be ignored in the placement process since it influences student retention and success...|$|R
40|$|Under the {{sponsorship}} of the U. S. Department of Energy’s National Energy Technology Laboratory, Siemens Westinghouse has conducted a three-year program to develop an ultra low NOx, fuel flexible catalytic combustor for gas turbine application in IGCC. The program is defined in three phases: Phase 1 - Implementation Plan, Phase 2 - Validation <b>Testing</b> and <b>Phase</b> 3 – <b>Field</b> <b>Testing.</b> Both <b>Phase</b> 1 and Phase 2 of the program have been completed. In IGCC power plants, the gas turbine must be capable of operating on syngas as a primary fuel and an available back-up fuel such as natural gas. In this program the Rich Catalytic Lean (RCLTM) technology is being developed as an ultra low NOx combustor. In this concept, ultra low NOx is achieved by stabilizing a lean premix combustion process by using a catalytic reactor to oxidize {{a portion of the}} fuel, increasing the temperature of fuel/air mixture prior to the main combustion zone. In Phase 1, the feasibility of the catalytic concept for syngas application has been evaluated and the key technology issues identified. In Phase II the technology necessary for the application of the catalytic concept to IGCC fuels was developed through detailed design and subscale <b>testing.</b> <b>Phase</b> III (currently not funded) will consist of full-scale combustor basket testing on natural gas and syngas...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to build a high temperature, cost-effective, logging while drilling (HT-LWD) system {{with the ability to}} operate at 175 C with more than 100 hours mean time between failures (MTBF). Such a commercial real-time formation evaluation (FE) system would help operators to drill and produce hydrocarbon resources from moderately deep, hot reservoirs which otherwise might be uneconomic to drill. The project plan was to combine the existing Sperry-Sun high temperature directional and gamma logging system with lower temperature FE sensors which were upgraded to higher temperature operation as part of the project. The project was to be completed in two phases. Phase I included the development of the HT system, building two complete systems, demonstrating operational capability at 175 C and survivability at 200 C in the laboratory, and successfully testing the system in two low temperature <b>field</b> <b>tests.</b> <b>Phase</b> II was to test the system in a well with a bottom hole temperature of 175 C. The high temperature FE sensors developed as part of this project include gamma ray (DGR), resistivity (EWR-Phase 4), neutron (CTN), and density (SLD). The existing high temperature pulser and telemetry system was upgraded to accommodate the data and bandwidth requirements of the additional sensors. Environmental and lifetime testing of system components and modules indicates that system life and reliability goals will be substantially exceeded. The system has performed well in domestic and international high temperature wells (to 175 C). In addition to the sensor modules specified in the project contract, Sperry has now upgraded other system components to higher temperature as well. These include a LWD sonic sensor (BAT), pressure while drilling sensor (PWD), and a more powerful central system controller (CIM) ...|$|R
40|$|Starting {{from the}} {{increasingly}} demand {{of performance and}} comforts on pleasure boats, this work refers to an innovative integrated system for the simultaneous production of fresh water and electricity onboard. In particular, a 1 kWe Stirling engine coupled with a thermal desalination plant has been considered for the purpose. The prototype, which refers to the distributed micro cogeneration field, has the final aim of building and testing a single effect distillation plant with a fresh water production of about 150 l/day. Firstly, the technical and economic feasibility has been evaluated together with the potential plant performance. Then, thermodynamic theories and numerical analysis have been adopted to define the final prototype configuration. Later on, a <b>field</b> <b>test</b> <b>phase</b> {{has been carried out}} to evaluate the actual plant performance. Hence, a comparative analysis with a compact reverse osmosis desalination plant has been performed. In general, the experimental analysis has been in good agreement with the predicted results. In particular, at nominal operating conditions (@ 50 °C) the maximum heat transfer rate was higher than the designed condition (5 kWt). Despite the non-ideal plant thermal insulation, fresh water production reached about 7 l/h at best operating conditions, proving a good process efficiency. Definitively, the experimental phase has provided a significant contribution to confirm and understand most of the mutual interconnections between the different key process parameters. According to the predicted behavior, fresh water production has been strongly dependent on salt content of the treated water and on temperature difference between the heating fluid and the salt water in the evaporator tank. However, even at the most severe operating conditions the thermal desalination plant has shown very interesting performance. Moreover, the apparatus exhibited a very good response to varying in time thermal power input thus confirming the opportunity to operate also powered by different forms of waste heat...|$|R

40|$|The {{first phase}} of this project {{involved}} {{the development of a}} high performance composite membranes for the treatment of natural gas. The objective of the second phase is to demonstrate the commercial potential of a full-size membrane module in a pilot scale <b>field</b> <b>test.</b> This <b>phase</b> is undertaken jointly with our commercial partner, UOP LLC. At the conclusion of Phase I, two composite membrane products had been developed for the enrichment (sweetening) of natural gas. The one was a low pressure membrane with a high CO{sub 2 }/CH{sub 4 } separation factor that falls within the target range of 25 - 30 (at 50 C) set for the program. This is a significant improvement over current commercial membranes that have separation factors of around 18 - 19. The second membrane had excellent high pressure capability and good contamination resistance, with a separation factor of 20 - 22. Based on the performance and the economic evaluation of the newly developed membranes, and with the input of UOP and DOE, it was decided to devote the demonstration phase of the program to the <b>field</b> <b>testing</b> and commercial evaluation of natural gas dehydration membranes. Due to the events of September 11, the program was also extended by 6 months until June 30, 2002. In Phase II, UOP has essentially completed preparation of the <b>field</b> <b>test</b> site.

In two experiments, repetition priming was exemplar-abstract yet visual when test objects were presented directly to the left cerebral hemisphere, but exemplar-specific when test objects were presented directly to the right cerebral hemisphere, contrary to predictions from single-system theories of object recognition. In two other experiments, stimulus degradation during encoding and task demands during test modulated these results in predicted ways. The results support the theory that dissociable neural subsystems operate in parallel (not in sequence) to underlie visual object recognition: An abstract-category subsystem operates more effectively than a specific-exemplar subsystem in the left hemi-sphere, and a specific-exemplar subsystem operates more effectivel...|$|R
40|$|The Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP), {{owned by}} the Department of Energy (DOE), has been {{enriching}} uranium since the early 1950 s. The enrichment process involves electrical and mechanical components that require periodic cleaning. The primary cleaning agent was trichloroethene (TCE) until the late 1980 s. Historical documentation indicates that a mixture of TCE and dry ice were used at PGDP for testing the integrity of steel cylinders, which stored depleted uranium. TCE and dry ice were contained in a below-ground pit and used during the integrity testing. TCE seeped from the pit and contaminated the surrounding soil. The Lasagna{trademark} technology was identified in the Record of Decision (ROD) as the selected alternative for remediation of the cylinder testing site. A public-private consortium formed in 1992 (including DOE, the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency, and the Kentucky Department for Environmental Protection, Monsanto, DuPont, and General Electric) developed the Lasagna{trademark} technology. This innovative technology employs electrokinetics to remediate soil contaminated with organics and is especially suited to sites with low permeability soils. This technology uses direct current to move water through the soil faster and more uniformly than hydraulic methods. Electrokinetics moves contaminants in soil pore water through treatment zones comprised of iron filings, where the contaminants are decomposed to basic chemical compounds such as ethane. After three years of development in the laboratory, the consortium <b>field</b> <b>tested</b> the Lasagna{trademark} process in several phases. CDM installed and operated Phase I, the trial installation and <b>field</b> <b>test</b> of a 150 -square-foot area selected for a 120 -day run in 1995. Approximately 98 percent of the TCE was removed. CDM then installed and operated the next phase (IIa), a year-long test on a 600 -square-foot site. Completed in July 1997, this test removed 75 {{percent of the total}} volume of TCE down to a depth of 45 feet. TCE in the test sites. Based on the successful <b>field</b> <b>tests</b> (<b>Phases</b> I and IIa), the ROD was prepared and the Lasagna{trademark} alternative was selected for remediation of TCE contaminated soils at the cylinder testing site Solid Waste Management Unit 91 (SWMU 91). Bechtel Jacobs Company LLC contracted CDM to construct and operate a full-scale Lasagna{trademark} remediation system at the site (Phase IIb). Construction began in August 1999 and the operational phase was initiated in December 1999. The Lasagna{trademark} system was operated for two years and reduced the average concentration of TCE in SWMU 91 soil from 84 ppm to less than 5. 6 ppm. Verification sampling was conducted during May, 2002. Results of the verification sampling indicated the average concentration of TCE in SWMU 91 soil was 0. 38 ppm with a high concentration of 4. 5 ppm...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. February 2017. Major: Educational Psychology. Advisors: Joan Garfield, Andrew Zieffler. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 289 pages. Developing students’ statistical thinking has been stressed {{as an important}} learning objective for statistics courses. In general, statistical thinking {{has been defined as}} “thinking like an expert applied statistician. ” However, there is currently no consensus on the characteristics that make up statistical thinking. In addition, there is no known assessment that measures the complete construct of statistical thinking. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess students’ statistical thinking in an introductory statistics course that is based on modeling and simulation. Specifically, the research question of interest was what components of students’ statistical thinking are revealed and developed in an introductory course that is based on modeling and simulation? To assess this, an assessment was created, called Modeling to Elicit Statistical Thinking (MODEST), that was based on a model of statistical thinking and utilized a type of problem that has been suggested to assess expert-like thinking (i. e., a Model-Eliciting Activity; MEA). To try to ensure that MODEST was an assessment of statistical thinking, several phases of feedback and pilot testing were carried out during the assessment development <b>phase.</b> In the <b>field</b> <b>test</b> <b>phase,</b> MODEST was administered online twice, at the beginning and at the end of the semester, to students enrolled in an introductory course that is based on modeling and simulation. Responses from 88 students were scored using a detailed scoring rubric to answer the research question. The results indicated that students appeared to enter the course with a moderate amount of statistical thinking (average score = 52 %) and leave having developed some statistical thinking as a result of the course (average score difference = 6 %; 95 % CI: 2 % to 10 %). Even though the increase in their overall statistical thinking was significant, it was moderate (Cohen’s d = 0. 34). Based on this, it appears that more could be done in the course to increase students’ statistical thinking. MODEST can be a valuable addition to the statistics education community by filling in the gap of assessing students’ statistical thinking. Both statistics education researchers and instructors would benefit from using MODEST to understand statistical thinking...|$|R

This master thesis deals with an experimental study of this heavy light interface and its behavior when exposed to rotation from the drill string. In this thesis three test rigs were designed and constructed. Based on the Reelwell operational and fluid properties, a total of 31 experimental studies were carried out. The studies investigated several parameters that influenced the dynamics of the heavy light interface and the resulting mixing zone...|$|R
