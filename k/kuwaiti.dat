5|$|Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, who {{had already}} {{tried and failed to}} draw Coalition troops into costly ground engagements by {{shelling}} Saudi positions and oil storage tanks and firing Scud surface-to-surface missiles at Israel, ordered the invasion of Saudi Arabia from southern Kuwait. The 1st and 5th Mechanized Divisions and 3rd Armored Division were ordered to conduct a multi-pronged invasion toward Khafji, engaging American, Saudi and <b>Kuwaiti</b> forces along the coastline.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Marine Corps {{reconnaissance}} {{estimated that}} the Iraqi Army had amassed around 60,000 troops across the border, near the <b>Kuwaiti</b> town of Wafra, {{in as many as}} 5 or 6 divisions. Infantry divisions normally consisted of three brigades with an attached commando unit, although some infantry divisions could have up to eight brigades–however most infantry divisions along the border were understrength, primarily due to desertion.|$|E
5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States in spring 1991, the 24th was reorganized with two brigades at Fort Stewart and the 3rd Brigade reactivated at Fort Benning, Georgia, replacing the 197th Infantry Brigade. In fall 1994, Iraq again threatened the <b>Kuwaiti</b> border, and two brigades from the division returned to southwest Asia. As part of the Army's reduction to a ten-division force, the 24th Infantry Division was inactivated on 15 February 1996 and reflagged to become the 3rd Infantry Division. Its three brigades were reflagged as 3rd Infantry Division brigades.|$|E
5|$|All 45 {{members of}} the Olympic Council of Asia that existed as of 2010 participated in the 2010 Asian Games. All National Olympic Committees were ordered to submit their entries before September 30, 2010. Organizers allowed each NOC to submit {{additional}} entries and injury replacements after the deadline. After the final registration deadline, some 9,704 athletes, {{as well as some}} 4,750 team officials, took part in the Games, an increase of 184 athletes from the previous Asian Games in Doha. According to the Games' official website, <b>Kuwaiti</b> athletes participated the Games under the Olympic flag because the Kuwait Olympic Committee was suspended due to political interference in January 2010.|$|E
5|$|Distressed by the {{occupation}} of Khafji, Saudi commander General Khaled bin Sultan appealed to American General Norman Schwarzkopf for an immediate air campaign against Iraqi forces {{in and around the}} city. However this was turned down because the buildings would make it difficult for aircraft to spot targets without getting too close. It was instead decided that the city would be retaken by Arab ground forces. The task fell to the 2nd Saudi Arabian National Guard Brigade's 7th Battalion, composed of Saudi infantry and two <b>Kuwaiti</b> tank companies attached to the task force. These were supported by U.S. Army Special Forces and Marine Reconnaissance personnel.|$|E
5|$|During the battle, Coalition forces {{incurred}} 43 fatalities and 52 injured casualties. This included 25 Americans killed, 11 {{of them by}} {{friendly fire}} along with 14 airmen killed when their AC-130 was shot down by Iraqi SAMs. The Americans also had two soldiers wounded and another two soldiers were captured in Khafji. Saudi and <b>Kuwaiti</b> casualties totaled 18 killed and 50 wounded. Two <b>Kuwaiti</b> AMX-30s main battle tanks and between seven and ten lightly armored Saudi V-150s were knocked out. Most of the V150s were knocked out by RPG-7 fire in close-range fighting inside the town of Khafji, although {{one of the two}} that was a catastrophic kill was hit by a 100mm main gun round from a T-55. Iraq listed its casualties as 71 dead, 148 wounded and 702 missing. U.S. sources present at the battle claim that 300 Iraqis lost their lives, and at least 90 vehicles were destroyed. Another source suggests that 60 Iraqi soldiers were killed and at least 400 taken prisoner, while no less than 80 armored vehicles were knocked out; however these casualties are attributed to the fighting both inside and directly north of Khafji. Whatever the exact casualties, the majority of three Iraqi mechanized/armored divisions had been destroyed. The U.S. Army's 2nd Armored Division's 1st Tiger Brigade claims 181 destroyed or captured enemy tanks, 148 APCs, 40 artillery pieces, 27 AA emplacements, 263 Iraqi dead and 4,051 captured after 100 hours of combat.|$|E
5|$|The Iraqi Army had between 350,000 and 500,000 {{soldiers}} in theater, organized into 51 divisions, including eight Republican Guard divisions. Republican Guard units normally received the newest equipment; for example, {{most of the}} estimated 1,000 T-72 tanks in the Iraqi Army {{on the eve of}} the war were in Republican Guard divisions. The Iraqi Army in the <b>Kuwaiti</b> Theater of Operations (KTO) also included nine heavy divisions, composed mostly of professional soldiers, but with weapons of a generally lesser grade than those issued to the Republican Guard.|$|E
5|$|The Saudi and <b>Kuwaiti</b> units renewed {{operations}} {{the following}} day. Two Iraqi companies, with about 20 armored vehicles, {{remained in the}} city and had not attempted to break out during the night. While the Saudi 8th Battalion continued operations in the southern portion of the city, the 7th Battalion began to clear the northern sector of the city. Iraqi resistance was sporadic and most Iraqi soldiers surrendered on sight; as a result, the city was recaptured on 1 February 1991.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Missouri was {{outfitted}} with 40mm grenade launchers and 25mm chain guns {{and sent to}} take part in Operation Earnest Will, the escorting of reflagged <b>Kuwaiti</b> oil tankers in the Persian Gulf. These smaller-caliber weapons were installed due to the threat of Iranian-manned, Swedish-made Boghammar cigarette boats operating in the Persian Gulf at the time. On 25 July, the ship departed on a six-month deployment to the Indian Ocean and North Arabian Sea. She spent more than 100 continuous days at sea in a hot, tense environment– a striking contrast to her world cruise months earlier. As the centerpiece for Battlegroup Echo, Missouri escorted tanker convoys through the Strait of Hormuz, keeping her fire control system trained on land-based Iranian Silkworm missile launchers.|$|E
5|$|In February 1973 Abu Daoud {{was arrested}} in Jordan for an attempt on King Hussein's life. This led to Abu Nidal's first operation, using the name Al-Iqab ("the Punishment"); on 5 September 1973 five gunmen entered the Saudi embassy in Paris, took 15 hostages and {{threatened}} {{to blow up the}} building if Abu Daoud was not released. The gunmen flew two days later to Kuwait on a Syrian Airways flight, still holding five hostages, then to Riyadh, threatening to throw the hostages out of the aircraft. They surrendered and released the hostages on 8 September. Abu Daoud was released from prison two weeks later; Seale writes that the <b>Kuwaiti</b> government paid King Hussein $12 million for his release.|$|E
5|$|That night, two U.S. Army heavy {{equipment}} transporters entered {{the city of}} Khafji, apparently lost, and were fired upon by Iraqi troops. Although one truck managed {{to turn around and}} escape, the two drivers of the second truck were wounded and captured. This led to a rescue mission organized by 3rd Battalion 3rd Marine Regiment, which sent a force of 30 men to extract the two wounded drivers. Although encountering no major opposition, they did not find the two drivers who had, by this time, been taken prisoner. The Marines did find a burnt out <b>Kuwaiti</b> AMX-30, with its dead crew. That same night, a U.S. Air Force AC-130 was shot down by an Iraqi surface-to-air missile (SAM), killing the aircraft's crew of 14.|$|E
5|$|The {{final two}} co-productions of the 1970s, both made in 1979, {{occurred}} in Kuwait and Spain. The <b>Kuwaiti</b> show, Iftah Ya Simsim, which ran until 1990, {{was the first}} of its kind in the Arab world. It used Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), and was broadcast in 22 Arab countries. The show continued to be well-known decades after it went off the air. It returned in 2013, and had similar goals and objectives as the original version, including the use of MSA. Barrio Sésamo, made in Spain, featured a snail character who was able to hide a thousand and one things in her shell. One of the show's Muppet characters, Dr. Valentin Ruster, was based upon Dr. Valentin Fuster, a native Spaniard who worked at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City. Dr. Fuster's likeness was created to educate children in Spain about exercise and eating healthy.|$|E
5|$|These three divisions, {{which had}} been heavily damaged by Coalition {{aircraft}} in the preceding days, attacked on 29 January. Most of their attacks were repulsed by U.S. Marines as well as U.S. Army Rangers and Coalition aircraft, {{but one of the}} Iraqi columns occupied Khafji on the night of 29–30 January. Between 30 January and 1 February, two Saudi Arabian National Guard battalions and two <b>Kuwaiti</b> tank companies attempted to retake control of the city, aided by Coalition aircraft and American artillery. By 1 February, the city had been recaptured at the cost of 43 Coalition servicemen dead and 52 wounded. Iraqi Army fatalities numbered between 60 and 300, while an estimated 400 were captured as prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|While {{the events}} at {{observation}} post 4 were unfolding, the Iraqi 5th Mechanized Division crossed the Saudi border near observation post 1. A Company of the 2nd Light Infantry Armored Battalion, which was screening the Iraqi unit, reported {{a column of}} 60–100 BMPs. The column was engaged by Coalition A-10s and Harrier jump jets. This was then followed by another column with an estimated 29 tanks. One of the column's T-62 tanks was engaged by an anti-tank missile and destroyed. Coalition air support, provided by A-10s and F-16s, engaged the Iraqi drive through observation post 1 and ultimately repulsed the attack back over the <b>Kuwaiti</b> border. Aircraft continued to engage the columns throughout the night, until the next morning. Another column of Iraqi tanks, approaching observation post 2, were engaged by aircraft and also repulsed that night.|$|E
5|$|After Operation Credible Sport {{ended the}} Army {{leadership}} decided the unit {{was needed for}} future contingency operations. Thusly, on October 16, 1981 Task Force 158 became the 160th Aviation Battalion, with Brown a founding member. The choice of the unit's name was accepted by the U.S. Army Institute of Heraldry as a logical progression of the 101st's 158th and 159th Battalions. The 160th Aviation Battalion was later renamed the 160th Special Operations Aviation Group in 1986; {{it was not until}} 1990 when it would take on its current name, 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment. In October 1983, Brown participated in the invasion of Grenada, during which his unit became the first aviation unit to use night vision goggles in combat. In the late 1980s, Brown led all U.S. forces assigned to Operation Prime Chance, which provided escort security for American-flagged <b>Kuwaiti</b> tankers during the Iran-Iraq War. During Operation Prime Chance Brown's unit became the first aviation unit to engage in combat using night vision devices when they engaged an Iranian-flagged ship, Iran Ajr, that was seen deploying mines in the Persian Gulf.|$|E

25|$|<b>Kuwaiti</b> {{society is}} {{markedly}} more open than other Gulf Arab societies. Kuwait {{stands out in}} the region as the most liberal in empowering women in the public sphere. <b>Kuwaiti</b> women outnumber men in the workforce. <b>Kuwaiti</b> political scientist Ghanim Alnajjar sees these qualities as a manifestation of <b>Kuwaiti</b> society as a whole, whereby in the Gulf region it is “the least strict about traditions”.|$|E
25|$|The Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development financed a water {{project in}} Sidon and Sour (<b>Kuwaiti</b> Dinar 10m {{approved}} in 1996), Beirut (<b>Kuwaiti</b> Dinar 17m approved in 2002) and {{for water and}} wastewater in various other areas of Lebanon (<b>Kuwaiti</b> Dinar 25m in 2006).|$|E
25|$|<b>Kuwaiti</b> society embraced {{liberal and}} Western attitudes {{throughout}} the 1960s and 1970s. For example, most <b>Kuwaiti</b> {{women did not}} wear the hijab in the 1960s and 70s.|$|E
25|$|When voting {{was first}} {{introduced}} in Kuwait in 1985, <b>Kuwaiti</b> women {{had the right to}} vote. The right was later removed. In May 2005, the <b>Kuwaiti</b> parliament re-granted female suffrage.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kuwaiti</b> Arabic is {{a variant}} of Gulf Arabic, sharing {{similarities}} with the dialects of neighboring coastal areas in Eastern Arabia. Due to immigration during its early history as well as trade, <b>Kuwaiti</b> Arabic borrowed a lot of words from Persian, Indian, Turkish, English and Italian. The Iranian sub-dialects of Larestani, Khonji, Bastaki and Gerashi also influenced the vocabulary of <b>Kuwaiti</b> Arabic.|$|E
25|$|Aside {{from the}} Marines, {{there was a}} small {{civilian}} caretaker presence on the island consisting of <b>Kuwaiti</b> citizens, as well as a few shop owners, which surprised the Marines a little bit as they were under the impression that the island was deserted. Nevertheless, the Marines felt very safe and secure on the island as Kuwait was an ostensibly U.S.-allied country, the <b>Kuwaiti</b> government told them it was safe, and {{there was a small}} contingent of <b>Kuwaiti</b> police there as well. In addition, the <b>Kuwaiti</b> civilians with whom the Marines interacted with were friendly and were ostensibly glad to have U.S. military forces in their country.|$|E
25|$|Kuwait {{has a large}} wealth-management {{industry}} that stands out in the region. <b>Kuwaiti</b> investment companies administer more assets than those of any other GCC country, save the much larger Saudi Arabia. The Kuwait Financial Centre, in a rough calculation, estimated that <b>Kuwaiti</b> firms accounted for over one-third of the total assets under management in the GCC. The relative strength of Kuwait in the financial industry extends to its stock market. For many years, the total valuation of all companies listed on the <b>Kuwaiti</b> exchange far exceeded the value of those on any other GCC bourse, except Saudi Arabia. In 2011, financial and banking companies made up {{more than half of}} the market capitalization of the <b>Kuwaiti</b> bourse; among all the Gulf states, the market capitalization of <b>Kuwaiti</b> financial-sector firms was, in total, behind only that of Saudi Arabia.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kuwaiti</b> {{society is}} diverse and tolerant. The {{majority}} of the population is Sunni Muslim, with a significant minority of Shia Muslims. The country includes a native Christian community, estimated to be composed of between 259 and 400 Christian <b>Kuwaiti</b> citizens. Kuwait is the only GCC country besides Bahrain to have a local Christian population who hold citizenship. There is also a small number of Bahá'í <b>Kuwaiti</b> citizens. Kuwait also has a large community of expatriate Christians, Hindus, Buddhists, and Sikhs.|$|E

25|$|Christian Kuwaitis can {{be divided}} into two groups. The first group {{includes}} the earliest <b>Kuwaiti</b> Christians, who originated from Iraq and Turkey. They have assimilated into <b>Kuwaiti</b> society, like their Muslim counterparts, and tend to speak Arabic with a <b>Kuwaiti</b> dialect; their food and culture are also predominantly <b>Kuwaiti.</b> The make up roughly a quarter of Kuwait's Christian population. The rest (roughly three-quarters) of Christian Kuwaitis make up the second group. They are more recent arrivals in the 1950s and 1960s, mostly Kuwaitis of Palestinian ancestry who were forced out of Palestine after 1948. There are also smaller numbers who originally hail from Syria and Lebanon. This second group is not as assimilated as the first group, as their food, culture, and Arabic dialect still retain a Levant feel. However, they are just as patriotic as the former group, and tend to be proud of their adopted homeland, with many serving in the army, police, civil, and foreign service. Most of Kuwait's citizen Christians belong to 12 large families, with the Shammas (from Turkey) and the Shuhaibar (from Palestine) families being some of the more prominent ones.|$|E
25|$|Political {{groups and}} {{parliamentary}} voting blocs exist, although most candidates run as independents. Once elected, many deputies form voting blocs in the National Assembly. <b>Kuwaiti</b> {{law does not}} recognize political parties. However, numerous political groups function as de facto political parties in elections, and there are blocs in the parliament. Major de facto political parties include the National Democratic Alliance, Popular Action Bloc, Hadas (<b>Kuwaiti</b> Muslim Brotherhood), National Islamic Alliance and the Justice and Peace Alliance.|$|E
25|$|In Kuwait, <b>Kuwaiti</b> {{children}} {{may go to}} free government kindergartens for two years (KG1 and KG2) {{between the ages of}} four and six.|$|E
25|$|The Great Depression harmed Kuwait's economy, {{starting}} in the late 1920s. International trading was one of Kuwait's main sources of income before oil. <b>Kuwaiti</b> merchants were mostly intermediary merchants. As {{a result of the}} decline of European demand for goods from India and Africa, Kuwait's economy suffered. The decline in international trade resulted in an increase in gold smuggling by <b>Kuwaiti</b> ships to India. Some <b>Kuwaiti</b> merchant families became rich from this smuggling. Kuwait's pearl industry also collapsed {{as a result of the}} worldwide economic depression. At its height, Kuwait's pearl industry had led the world's luxury market, regularly sending out between 750 and 800 ships to meet the European elite's desire for pearls. During the economic depression, luxuries like pearls were in little demand. The Japanese invention of cultured pearls also contributed to the collapse of Kuwait's pearl industry.|$|E
