2500|$|The {{church of}} All Saints, Syerston is small, as befits a former parochial chapelry, {{and has an}} aisle-less nave. It {{measures}} within from the east wall {{to the door of}} the vestry at the base of the tower, just under sixty-seven and a half feet; and from the south to the north wall nearly fifteen feet. The nave and chancel are probably of fourteenth-century origin and were rebuilt in 1896 in memory of G. H. Fillingham (q.v), at the expense of his widow. On the south side are two square headed fourteenth century windows as well as a, probably earlier, double-lancet window. On the north side is a blocked-up doorway; it may have been used as an exit point for the processions which were a feature of church services before the Reformation. The porch was repaired in 1724 and bears the date and the initials W.H.and C.W. The very fine carved-oak pulpit, its eight sides, backboard, and canopy all a mass of carved panels, is from 1636. [...] The pews are Victorian. The arms of George III are displayed on a square painted board. The monuments are all to the Fillinghams from William the <b>encloser,</b> who died in 1795 to George Augustus, died 1974. There is a small unbuttressed thirteenth-century tower, with battlements which replaced an earlier brick and plaster parapet at the 1896 refurbishment. Two scratch (or mass) dials, each with its central hole for a gnomon, appear on the south wall of the church to the right of the porch, and another, strangely inverted, scratch dial appears incorporated into the stonework of the porch, probably upturned at its rebuilding. These would have given some indication of the times of church services and perhaps also acted as a village timepiece, before clocks came into general use.|$|E

Mr. Greenwood finds the young Shakspere impossible--because of his ignorance--which made him such a really good pseudo-author, and such a successful mask for Bacon, or Bacon's unknown equivalent. The Shakspere of later life, the well-to-do Shakspere, the purchaser {{of the right to}} bear arms; so bad at paying one debt at least; so eager a creditor; a would-be <b>encloser</b> of a common; a man totally bookless, is, to Mr. Greenwood's mind, an impossible author of the later plays.|$|E

60|$|This is {{a natural}} power, like light and heat, and all nature cooperates with it. The reason why we feel one man's {{presence}} and do not feel another's {{is as simple as}} gravity. Truth is the summit of being; justice is the application of it to affairs. All individual natures stand in a scale, according to the purity of this element in them. The will of the pure runs down from them into other natures as water runs down from a higher into a lower vessel. This natural force is no more to be withstood than any other natural force. We can drive a stone upward for a moment into the air, but it is yet true that all stones will forever fall; and whatever instances can be quoted of unpunished theft, or of a lie which somebody credited, justice must prevail, and it is the privilege of truth to make itself believed. Character is this moral order seen through the medium of an individual nature. An individual is an <b>encloser.</b> Time and space, liberty and necessity, truth and thought, are left at large no longer. Now, the universe is a close or pound. All things exist in the man tinged with the manners of his soul. With what quality is in him he infuses all nature that he can reach; nor does he tend to lose himself in vastness, but, at how long a curve soever, all his regards return into his own good at last. He animates all he can, and he sees only what he animates. He encloses the world, as the patriot does his country, as a material basis for his character, and a theatre for action. A healthy soul stands united with the Just and the True, as the magnet arranges itself with the pole; so that he stands to all beholders like a transparent object betwixt them and the sun, and whoso journeys towards the sun, journeys towards that person. He is thus the medium of the highest influence to all who are not on the same level. Thus, men of character are the conscience of the society to which they belong.|$|E
6000|$|It is hard, indeed, to {{set forth}} {{the views of}} the Baconians and of the [...] "Anti-Willians" [...] in a shape which will satisfy them. The task, {{especially}} when undertaken by an unsympathetic person, is perhaps impossible. I can only summarise their views in my own words as far as I presume to understand them. I conceive the Baconians to cry that [...] "the world possesses a mass of transcendent literature, attributed to a man named William SHAKESPEARE." [...] Of a man named William SHAKSPERE (there are many varieties of spelling) we certainly know that he was born (1564) and bred in Stratford-on-Avon, a peculiarly dirty, stagnant, and ignorant country town. There is absolutely no evidence that he (or any Stratford boy of his standing) ever went to Stratford school. His father, his mother, and his daughter could not write, but, in signing, made their marks; and if he could write, which some of us deny, he wrote a terribly bad hand. As far as late traditions of seventy or eighty years after his death inform us, he was a butcher's apprentice; and also a schoolmaster [...] "who knew Latin pretty well"; and a poacher. He made, before he was nineteen, a marriage tainted with what Meg Dods calls [...] "ante-nup." [...] He early had three children, whom he deserted, as he deserted his wife. He came to London, we do not know when (about 1582, according to the [...] "guess" [...] of an antiquary of 1680); held horses at the door of a theatre (so tradition says), was promoted to the rank of [...] "servitor" [...] (whatever that may mean), became an actor (a vagabond under the Act), and by 1594 played before Queen Elizabeth. He put money in his pocket (heaven knows how), for by 1597 he was bargaining for the best house in his native bourgade. He obtained, by nefarious genealogical falsehoods (too common, alas, in heraldry), the right to bear arms; and went on acting. In 1610-11 (?) he retired to his native place. He never took any interest in his unprinted manuscript plays; though rapacious, he never troubled himself about his valuable copyrights; never dreamed of making a collected edition of his works. He died in 1616, probably of drink taken. Legal documents prove him to have been a lender of small sums, an avid creditor, a would-be <b>encloser</b> of commons. In his will he does not bequeath or mention any books, manuscripts, copyrights, and so forth. It is utterly incredible, then, that this man wrote the poems and plays, so rich in poetry, thought, scholarship, and knowledge, which are attributed to [...] "William Shakespeare." [...] These must be the works of [...] "a concealed poet," [...] a philosopher, a courtier moving in the highest circles, a supreme legist, and, necessarily, a great poet, and student of the classics.|$|E

This wild area posed far fewer {{challenges for the}} <b>encloser</b> than the more densely populated and intensively cultivated areas of Penkridge parish. However, there were still rows with neighbouring landowners and with cultivators who used {{the resources of the}} Hay. In 1561 Henry Stafford, 1st Baron Stafford, complained that Sir Edward Littleton (d. 1574) was committing spoils there. In 1569 the Earl of Oxford complained that Littleton's enclosures prevented his tenants in Acton Trussell and Bednall pasturing their animals in the Hay and obstructed their common way to Cannock Wood and Cannock Heath. The Littletons went on to establish a park and coppice in the Hay. In 1675 the people of Penkridge and Bednall demanded that both be thrown open. The struggle was to continue until all common land in the Hay was finally enclosed in 1827.|$|E
50|$|Recorded as Loans, Lones, or Lons, {{the name}} of the village may have no {{connection}} with lending and be derived from the green loans or loaning (a piece of soft, rough ground) around the Bushie and Craiksland Burns, which joined each other at the foot the old orchard at Crossburn.

50|$|Leveson's main estates were at Lilleshall and Trentham, {{although}} he inherited or acquired many smaller estates and houses. The estates were assessed at £313 {{at the beginning}} of his wardship - an income commensurate with landed gentry status. However, Leveson was regionally powerful and influential, not least because he also had lucrative business interests in the North Sea trade - interests which were to prove his undoing. He was ruthless in pursuing his interests in his estates. After a long dispute, he managed to recover possession of Leegomery, near Wellington, Shropshire from his sister Elizabeth and her husband, William Sheldon.Leveson, like all his family, was a vigorous <b>encloser.</b> He did all he could to establish effective control of marginal or disputed lands around his estates. This was especially so in the Weald Moors, a large, extra-parochial area, stretching west of Lilleshall, where tenants in all the surrounding manors had common grazing rights. The landowners all wanted to maximise their profit from the moors by draining and improving them, and were determined to have defined boundaries. In 1574 Leveson and the lord of Kynnersley agreed on a fixed boundary. In 1582 George Talbot, 6th Earl of Shrewsbury, who was lord of Wrockwardine, sold his interest in the moor to Leveson for a perpetual rent. Leveson then set about enclosing and improving so that he could let out separate holdings. Very soon the whole area from Wrockwardine to Kynnersley was enclosed by Leveson or his tenants, apart from a few remaining areas of marshy soil. On Leveson's estate at Little Wenlock the tenants had access to the woods for timber, although both their tenth and the rest of the woodland were in poor condition because of poor management and constant extraction of timber for building. Leveson enclosed all the woodland, simply abrogating the commoners' rights.|$|E
5000|$|For {{most of its}} existence, Syerston {{seems to}} have been a chapelry of East Stoke, from which it is {{physically}} separated by Elston parish. Dr Robert Thoroton says ' I suppose this Town is in Stoke Parish, for the Vicar comes and serves the Cure here';. This ecclesiastical arrangement was superseded in 1866 when one of the effects of the Poor Law Amendment Act of that year, was to make places which levied a separate poor rate into civil parishes. So Syerston gained its independence from East Stoke. The church of All Saints, Syerston is small, as befits a former parochial chapelry, and has an aisle-less nave. It measures within from the east wall to the door of the vestry at the base of the tower, just under sixty-seven and a half feet; and from the south to the north wall nearly fifteen feet.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores {{how early}} modern playwrights articulated complaint and critique through a dramaturgy of hunger. During {{the sixteenth and seventeenth}} centuries England faced poor harvests, changes in land use, and ineffectual government action leading to repeated subsistence crises both actual and perceived. Employing the anthropological concept of “foodways,” which recognizes food’s entanglement in multiple imaginative and material systems of meaning, the dissertation offers a corrective to contemporary literary and cultural scholarship in {{accounting for the}} sociopolitical implications of consumption in the context of these crises. Playwrights addressed the inequities of feasting and hunger in England from a range of competing ideological perspectives, engaging with the cultural dilemmas posed by scarcity through the interplay of plenty and want onstage. Chapter One explores the poor harvest of 1586 and the drama produced in its wake, in which hungry tyrants call attention to imaginative tensions within religious framings of hunger as a punishment. Shakespeare’s 2 Henry VI simultaneously presents the rebel Cade as an ambitious glutton and draws attention to the consuming violence of the <b>encloser</b> Alexander Iden. Chapter Two focuses on two historical duologies influenced by the scarcity of the 1590 s that re-evaluated governmental discourses condemning specific economic agents for exacerbating dearth. Shakespeare’s Henry IV plays suggest the corruption of Justices Shallow and Silence in tandem with Falstaff, while Thomas Heywood’s Edward IV plays highlight the king’s failures of traditional hospitality. Chapter Three first analyzes how Shakespeare drew on images of James-as-father and Elizabeth-as-nurturing-mother to address the 1607 Midlands Revolt in Coriolanus and Timon of Athens, then explores Thomas Middleton and Thomas Dekker’s The Bloody Banquet, which links the Queen’s starved infants with the appetites of the father-Tyrant’s court and implicitly interrogates the material value of patriarchal political theory. Chapter Four argues that representations of hungry soldiers in early Caroline drama echo Continental military humiliations to indict the royal favorite Buckingham. In The Unnatural Combat, Philip Massinger subverts this paradigm to blame the captain Belgarde’s hunger on the governor’s neglect, condemning Charles I for subsistence failures and suggesting the threat posed by an unchecked royal will. 2019 - 03 - 04 T 00 : 00 : 00...|$|E
