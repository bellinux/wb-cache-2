25|$|Intersex {{people are}} {{excluded}} almost completely. Intersex isn’t {{as rare as}} it seems; about 1% {{of the population is}} intersex in some way. News medias outline {{what it means to be}} male or female, which causes a gap for anyone who doesn’t fall into those two categories. This has led newspapers to bring up issues like intersexuality in athletes due to sports being gendered, leaving the big question to everyone on what <b>exactly</b> <b>is</b> intersexuality. This was brought to worldwide attention with the case of Caster Semenya, where news spread on sporting officials having to determine whether she was to be considered female or male.|$|E

25|$|In the 20th century, the Newtonian {{concepts}} of absolute {{time and space}} were challenged by relativity. Einstein's principle of equivalence put all observers, moving or accelerating, on the same footing. This led to an ambiguity as to what <b>exactly</b> <b>is</b> meant {{by the force of}} gravity and weight. A scale in an accelerating elevator cannot be distinguished from a scale in a gravitational field. Gravitational force and weight thereby became essentially frame-dependent quantities. This prompted the abandonment of the concept as superfluous in the fundamental sciences such as physics and chemistry. Nonetheless, the concept remained important in the teaching of physics. The ambiguities introduced by relativity led, starting in the 1960s, to considerable debate in the teaching community as how to define weight for their students, choosing between a nominal definition of weight as the force due to gravity or an operational definition defined by the act of weighing.|$|E
500|$|After seven episodes, Richard Eisenbeis of Kotaku {{disliked the}} series {{so much that}} he {{discouraged}} viewers from watching it for that particular season. He supported this by stating that the premise of teenagers summoning monsters has been done to death and that the adaptation has no compelling mysteries nor are there deeper psychological dilemmas being explored. Eisenbeis shared sentiments with the Anime News Network reviewers when he elaborated on what he called the [...] "woefully underdeveloped" [...] characters of Devil Survivor 2 who are only given rudimentary back-stories. This had the added effect of making it nearly impossible to figure out who <b>exactly</b> <b>is</b> a one-off character and who is a main character since they are all equally subjected to the threat of death. Eisenbeis noted that this made their demise genuinely shocking as it added to the viewing tension. Eisenbeis went on to write that the other characters were contrast to the main villain (or antihero) Yamato Hotsuin since he gets so much development that much of the series' runtime is spent on his backstory and goals than all the other characters combined. This helps give an in-depth understanding of the character and simultaneously made him an excellent villain.|$|E
500|$|Aside {{from the}} genre's punk and {{alternative}} rock roots, many grunge bands were equally influenced by heavy metal {{of the early}} 1970s. Clinton Heylin, author of Babylon's Burning: From Punk to Grunge, cited Black Sabbath as [...] "perhaps the most ubiquitous pre-punk influence on the northwest scene". Black Sabbath {{played a role in}} shaping the grunge sound, through their own records and the records they inspired. Musicologist Bob Gulla asserted that Black Sabbath's sound [...] "shows up in virtually all of grunge's most popular bands, including Nirvana, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains". The influence of Led Zeppelin is also evident, particularly in the work of Soundgarden, whom Q magazine noted were [...] "in thrall to '70s rock, but contemptuous of the genre's overt sexism and machismo". Jon Wiederhorn of Guitar World wrote: [...] "So what <b>exactly</b> <b>is</b> grunge?...Picture a supergroup made up of Creedence Clearwater Revival, Black Sabbath and the Stooges, and you're pretty close." [...] Catherine Strong states that grunge's strongest metal influence was thrash metal, which had a tradition of [...] "equality with the audience", based on the notion that [...] "anyone could start a band" [...] (a way of thinking also shared by US hardcore punk, which Strong also cites as an influence on grunge) which was also taken up by grunge bands. Strong states that grunge musicians were opposed to the then-popular [...] "hair metal" [...] bands.|$|E

[...] Chris Willman from Yahoo! compared the song to Gaga's [...] "Telephone", where Knowles appears as a featured artist, and wrote that [...] "Maybe it's because {{the lack of a}} video for Gaga's [...] "Telephone" [...] leaves more to the imagination, but if this were a contest, I'd have to say her tune trumps Beyoncé's.
