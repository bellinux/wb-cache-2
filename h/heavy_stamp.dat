[...] The title La Clef du cabinet des princes de l’Europe ou recuëil historique & politique sur les matieres du tems was a whole agenda: the newspaper was to grant insight behind the scenes of the government cabinets, where war and peace in Europe were decided (this was the time of the War of the Spanish Succession).The structure was always the same: international news, divided by the kingdoms; there was a rubric for [...] "Gossip and Current Affairs" [...] (ceremonies and hunts that the King had participated in, birth of monarchs' children, etc.), and reviews of new books. Gradually, more and more news on regional parliaments appeared, or articles on Enlightenment philosophers who opposed absolutism. The first 12 years the newspaper appeared without the name of the editor or the place of publication. As it did not have a Privilège royal, it was not protected against unlicensed reprinting, and had to pay a <b>heavy</b> <b>stamp</b> duty.|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{addressed}} {{to the question of}} an appropriate planning technology in Zimbabwe. Note is taken of some of the physical and social manifestations of "Capitalist Planning" in methods borrowed from Eurocentric Social Democracy which still bear the <b>heavy</b> <b>stamp</b> of Keynesianism and welfare state doctrines. History has revealed the latter doctrines to have been social instruments of oppression devised during the Great Depression of 1929 - 1939, to contain social revolution in North America. Lacking the basic historical base of real experiences that is the social field of inquiry, the paper argues, the missing element in National Planning strategies has been the scant attention paid to the accumulation of social technology. Despite very glib references to the mode of production, Marxists in Zimbabwe have not as yet been {{able to come up with}} a National Planning System that goes beyond the imperatives of World Bank and IMF-funded research proposals into the social relations of production. Research proposals emanating from these very eminent world resourceful persons sitting in Washington DC are mere instruments for the containment of the African revolution, whose tornado is currently sweeping over the sub-continent. It is therefore unlikely in the long run that the grey eminence of International Capital can actually sponsor research that is for the common good of the struggling masses of Azania. The paper also seeks to warn against the adoption of imported intellectual fashions. Import substitution projects should surely stop at the material base of society, because clearly in Africa, the limits for the indigenization of the social logic for capital accumulation have been reached. Planners in the political, economic and social sciences should therefore now direct their attention to the whole issue of indigenizing the socialist political economy. At the most basic level then the debate about planning amongst the left intellectuals in Zimbabwe is still not about the dualism of ideologies in Zimbabwe's superstructure. Rather, it is the articulation of Euro-centric versions of what the best road is to socialism. This is manifested in the fragmentation of the whole academic field of planning into regional and urban planning, social planning, district planning, etc. And despite much talk about political economy, we have not stopped to engage in self-critiques of our own individual planning ideologies or notions of "order"...|$|E

A cradle such as you see in the upper picture, water, a tin pan, this was the most simple apparatus, and sometimes enormous nuggets were found, almost pure lumps of virgin gold. The gold is now obtained from the quartz, a process involving heavy and expensive machinery, the chief being a battery of <b>heavy</b> <b>stamps</b> to crunch the quartz.

The boy was strong and swift, the girl stout and ungainly in her movements, not mistress of her body; he caught her and twisted her arm, roughly--Janet could hear her cries through the window-=when an elderly woman entered, seized him, struggling with him.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In manufacturing, automation has replaced many dangerous, mundane, arduous and routine manual operations, for example, transportation of <b>heavy</b> parts, <b>stamping</b> of large parts, repetitive welding and bolt fastening. However, skilled operators still carry out critical manual processes in various industries such as aerospace, automotive and heavy-machinery. As automation technology progresses through more flexible and intelligent systems, the potential for these processes to be automated increases. However, the decision to undertake automation is a complex one, involving consideration of many factors such as return of investment, health and safety, life cycle impact, competitive advantage, and resources and technology availability. A key challenge to manufacturing automation {{is the ability to}} adapt to process variability. In manufacturing processes, human operators apply their skills to adapt to variability, {{in order to meet the}} product and process specifications or requirements. This thesis is focussed on understanding the ‎variability involved in these manual processes, and how it may influence the automation solution. ‎ Two manual industrial processes in polishing and de-burring of high-value components were observed to evaluate the extent of the variability and how the operators applied their skills to overcome it. Based on the findings from the literature and process studies, a framework was developed to categorise variability in manual manufacturing processes and to suggest a level of automation for the tasks in the processes, based on scores and weights given to the parameters by the user. The novelty of this research lies in the creation of a framework to categorise and evaluate process variability, suggesting an appropriate level of automation. The framework uses five attributes of processes; inputs, outputs, strategy, time and requirements and twelve parameters (quantity, range or interval of variability, interdependency, diversification, number of alternatives, number of actions, patterned actions, concurrency, time restriction, sensorial domain, cognitive requisite and physical requisites) to evaluate variability inherent in the process. The level of automation suggested is obtained through a system of scores and weights for each parameter. The weights were calculated using Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) with the help of three experts in manufacturing processes. Finally, this framework was validated through its application to two processes consisting of a lab-based peg-in-a-hole manual process and an industrial process on welding. In addition, the framework was further applied to three processes (two industrial processes and one process simulated in the laboratory) by two subjects for each process to verify the consistency of the results obtained. The results suggest that the framework is robust when applied by different subjects, presenting high similarity in outputs. Moreover, the framework was found to be effective when characterising variability present in the processes where it was applied. The framework was developed and tested in manufacturing of high value components, with high potential to be applied to processes in other industries, for instance, automotive, heavy machinery, pharmaceutical or electronic components, although this would need further investigation. Thus, future work would include the application of the framework in processes in other industries, hence enhancing its robustness and widening its scope of applicability. Additionally, a database would be created to assess the correlation between process variability and the level of automation...|$|R
