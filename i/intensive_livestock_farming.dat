For every ton of Carbon captured through a Carbon Offset Program, a qualified “Carbon Credit / Carbon Offset” is created. Companies such as British Petroleum (BP), Google, Chevron, FedEx and several hundred US companies purchase carbon credits at established market prices, in some cases to avoid environmental penalties that cost well in excess of the carbon credit. Thus, NAVF provides financing and project management for North American indigenous tribes, given that the total land holdings of this minority is in excess of 3% of the entire landmass of the continent.

40|$|As {{goals are}} set to {{increase}} the share of renewable energy production within the province of Overijssel, the Netherlands, the project group Groen Gas Salland is founded and has taken the initiative to explore the opportunities of green gas production through a biogas infrastructure within the region of Salland. Since within the region of Salland (<b>intensive)</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> is practised, {{it is assumed that}} the utilisation of manure for the production of green gas by means of the anaerobic digestion process has a considerable potential. To comprehend whether the manure can be made available for energy production, it is necessary to learn how manure is currently used and valued by the local farmers within Salland. Due to <b>intensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> the manure production exceeds the local demand for manure-based fertilisers, which is considered a problem as this (local) abundance of manure urges for a manure distribution system of which the costs are high. Furthermore, circumstances within the (<b>intensive)</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming</b> sector are changing especially due to the amendment of policies that monitor farming activities. Changes within these institutional rules and especially the perceptions that these changes occur unpredictably, affect the decision making of local farmers and will influence the condition that underlie the manure distribution system. In order to explore the potential for manure-based energy within this complex system, we developed an agent-based model by means of the MAIA framework. Based on our research we found that the energy potential is low due to several related causes. A clear expectation of what will be gained is lacking due to uncertainties about both the amount of subsidy that will be granted and the order of the specific technology costs. Furthermore, since a sufficient production capacity is required, many small-scale to middle-scale farms will not consider manure-based energy production. A considerable investment capital is required as well, this puts a lot of pressure upon the farmers as they often experience at the same time poor financial situations and ongoing changes in the policies. We state that farmers do not obtain a clear benefit concerning the production of manure-based energy as current issues with respect to the abundance of manure are not solved and meanwhile the produced digestate, almost identical in volume and composition to manure, had to find its way back to the manure distribution system. Although cooperation between farmers should not be taken for granted, we found in case farmers do cooperate, the potential for manure-based energy production to be highly increased. In order to increase the potential, we recommend to create a clear benefit from a farmer's point of view, increase their understanding with respect to manure-based energy and reduce institutional barriers, especially with respect to regulations that control subsidy.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an attempt to {{estimate}} the regional and national economic consequences of a wholesale move to sustainable agricultural systems in the UK. The study reviews definitions of agricultural sustainability, and draws a distinction between sustainable and organic farming systems. Farm-level definitions of sustainability are developed for all the main farm types encountered in the UK, and key indicators with targets are developed to assess and monitor any move towards sustainability. Linear Programming models are constructed, for 23 representative UK farm types under conventional and sustainable farming scenarios, to estimate the farm-level impacts of the adoption of sustainable farming {{at some point in the}} future. The farm-level models are aggregated to regional and national levels to estimate the likely changes in UK agricultural production of a more widespread adoption of sustainable farming practices. The wider economic effects of these changes at the regional and national levels are then examined by the use of output, income and employment multipliers.

40|$|The 'Law on Reconstruction of the Concentration Areas' (2002) {{applies to}} the Dutch sandy areas where the {{concentration}} of <b>intensive</b> <b>livestock</b> is high. Goals expressed in this law are a reduction of veterinary risks {{and an increase in}} the quality of the environment and nature, including quality of landscape and water. To achieve these goals, the provinces have prepared reconstruction plans. Parties participating in their preparation do subscribe to them, which is an important success factor for implementation. The plans provide for spatial partitioning of land-use functions. The proposed zoning is small-scaled; however, this type of zoning can be made more effective by choosing larger areas. Realizing fewer small-scaled nature areas in the National Ecological Network is a precondition. The budget requested for realization of these plans is 7 billion euro for the 2004 - 2016 period, to be invested mainly in nature, water management and agriculture. Investments in agriculture are directed to scaling-up through transfer of over 400 <b>intensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farms</b> and the establishment of specified areas for agricultural development. Outside incidental advantages at local level, farm transfer will not benefit the quality of nature and the environment. Reduction of veterinary risks, the political reason for the reconstruction, has been given little attention in the plans. Curative measures will be less necessary after the policy of non-vaccination has been abandoned, but preventive measures will still be needed. Measures anticipated for quantitative water management will contribute substantially to existing goals. Implementation of the plans will also contribute to the realization of new nature areas in the National Ecological Network. The reconstruction plans will not achieve a decrease in nutrient streams, and therefore not respond to the challenge of meeting environmental policy goals; the generic manure policy is expected to bring this about. However, as it is uncertain if the revised manure policy will succeed in realizing its goals, this is considered a risky projection.

The purpose of this legislation is to reach a new balance between various functions in the rural areas. In the current report conclusions are drawn regarding plan development, based on literature and a series of interviews with parties involved in the planning process. The study gives the impression that parties involved subscribe to the plans, there is support. This legislation stipulates differentiation between areas where agriculture can develop, areas where various functions are intertwined and areas for extensifying agricultural activities. The emphasis by law on zoning results in less attention being paid to other possible solutions for problems related tot <b>intensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming.</b> In the provinces of Noord-Limburg and Noord-Brabant, existing but unused planological rights remain valid in the extensification zones; so there is no change compared to the existing situation as laid down in regional plans. The initial ambitions in the extensification zones were adjusted, after both the central government and the provinces appeared hesitant to pay for damage caused by earlier planning. The designation of pig-free zones free is an obligation by law, however, the informers are sceptical about the benefits. Although stronger co-operation between farmers and their supply and purchase companies could diminish the veterinary vulnerability, no initiatives have been taken to this effect in the plans. The central government will assess the plans according to a detailed framework and decide for financing, after the provinces have drawn up the plans. This will leave little room for interpretation by provinces themselves. Due to developments in relevant environmental laws and re-prioritising policy goals, parties involved had little certainty beforehand.

We have investigated the influence of three different sources of enhanced N deposition on NO and N 2 O emissions 1) elevated NH 3 deposition to woodlands downwind of poultry and pig farms, 2) increased wet cloud and occult N deposition to upland forest and moorland and 3) enhanced N deposition to trees as NO- 3 and NH+ 4 aerosol. Flux measurements of NO and N 2 O were made using static chambers in the field or intact and repacked soil cores in the laboratory and determination of N 2 O by gas chromatography and of NO by chemiluminescence analysis. Rates of N deposition to our study sites were derived from modelled estimates of N deposition, NH 3 concentrations measured by passive diffusion and inference from measurements of the 210 Pb inventory of soils under tree canopies compared with open grassland.

40|$|Simulation {{was used}} to analyze the {{distribution}} of benefits from the 1981 and 1982 federal income tax legislation for farm types that exhibit various tax characteristics. The results indicate that distributional effects are largely attributable to the reduced progressivity of the tax rate schedule. The largest farms benefited relative to the smaller farms of all <b>farm</b> types. <b>Intensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farms</b> and producers of perennial crops experience additional benefits relative to other farm types primarily because of the large reduction in useful life for tax purposes of specialized livestock facilities, orchards, and vineyards. Almost all farmers could benefit from the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 (ERTA), but not all farmers could benefit equally. Dif-ferences in benefits depended on the farm en-terprise mix, and the type and quantity of as-sets used in production, For example, the im-pact of accelerated depreciation on farm in-come and growth was likely to differ between an intensive hog operation with large amounts of depreciable property and a cattle ranch with relatively little depreciable property, Other differences depended on the farmer’s total in-come. Tax rates were cut in all tax brackets, but the reduction in tax liabilities was greatest for the higher income taxpayers. The Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) of 1982, modified some ERTA pro-visions, but did not alter the basic thrust of the legislation. This study quantifies the distribution of ben-efits from the 1981 and 1982 income tax re-form among farmers by farm size and major enterprise. The benefits of the tax reform came primarily through reduced tax liabilities, which create higher after-tax income and per-mit greater farm business growth.

The policy simulations show that impacts on structural change, competitiveness, and income distribution vary greatly depending on how the policy scheme is implemented. If direct pay-ments are completely decoupled from land use (no obligation to farm land) this has significant and lasting effects on the competitiveness of agriculture, structural change, farmers’ incomes and land-use. agricultural policy analysis, agent-based models, decoupling...|$|E
40|$|Mechanized milking {{has become}} widely used for buffalos in Italy in recent years, thus {{improving}} {{the management and}} the productivity of farms. The apparent similarities between buffalo and cattle have often resulted in applying the same milking systems and techniques currently used for dairy cows. Considering the effect of mechanical milking on animal health, productivity, and welfare in <b>intensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farming,</b> this study compares the effects of milking at low vacuum (36 kPa) and medium vacuum (42 kPa) on milk emission characteristics and milking system performance. Individual milk flow curves were registered to analyze milk yield, average flow rate, and milking time, and milking operations were recorded to evaluate the system performances. When using 36 kPa vacuum, {{a significant increase in}} milking time and in the lag time before milk ejection occurred, as well as a decrease in average flow rate and residual milk. However, the vacuum level did not influence both milk yield and milk ejection time. As a consequence of decreasing the vacuum level to 36 kPa, the milking system throughput was decreased at most by 5 buffalo/h...|$|E
40|$|Increased {{agricultural}} intensification {{has led to}} well-documented {{declines in}} the fauna and flora associated with intensive grasslands in the UK. We aimed to quantify the effectiveness of different field margin management strategies for putting bumblebee and butterfly biodiversity back into intensive grasslands. Using four <b>intensive</b> <b>livestock</b> <b>farms</b> in south-west England, we manipulated conventional management practices (addition of inorganic fertilizer, cutting frequency and height, and aftermath grazing) to generate seven grass-based treatments along a gradient of decreasing management intensity. We also tested two more interventionist treatments which introduced sown components into the sward: (i) a cereal, grass and legume mix, and (ii) a diverse conservation mix with kale, mixed cereals, linseed and legumes. These crop mixtures were intended to provide forage and structural resources for pollinators but were not intended to have agronomic value as livestock feed. Using a replicated block design, we monitored bumblebee and butterfly responses in 27 plots (10 x 50 m) in each farm from 2003 to 2006. Bumblebees were most abundant, species-rich and diverse in the sown treatments and virtually absent from the grass-based treatments. The diverse conservation mix treatment supported larger and more diverse bumblebee assemblages than the cereal, grass and legume mix treatment. The sown treatments, and the most extensively managed grass-based treatments, had the highest abundance, species richness and diversity of adult butterflies, whereas butterfly larvae were only found in the grass-based treatments. Bumblebee and butterfly assemblage structure was driven by floral abundance, floral richness, the availability of nectar resources, and sward structure. Only vegetation cover was correlated with butterfly larval abundance. Synthesis and applications. This study has identified management options {{in the margins of}} intensive grasslands which can enhance bumblebee and butterfly biodiversity. Extensification of conventional grass management by stopping fertilization, reducing cutting frequency and not grazing, benefits butterflies. However, to enhance bumblebees requires a more interventionist approach in the form of sowing flower-rich habitat. Both approaches are potentially suitable for adoption in agri-environment schemes in the UK and Europe...|$|R
50|$|The {{enclosure}} {{of livestock}} in pastures and barns {{is a relatively}} new development in the history of agriculture. When cattle are enclosed, the type of confinement may vary from a small crate, a large-area fenced-in pasture, or a paddock. The type of feed may vary from naturally growing grass to animal feed. Animals are usually intentionally bred through artificial insemination or supervised mating. Indoor production systems are typically used for pigs, dairy cattle, poultry, veal cattle, dairy goats, and other animals depending on the region and season. Animals kept indoors are generally farmed intensively, as large space requirements could make indoor farming unprofitable if not impossible. However, indoor farming systems are controversial due to problems associated with handling animal waste, odours, the potential for groundwater contamination, and animal welfare concerns.
