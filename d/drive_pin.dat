In the Mercedes-Euklid, a long slotted lever, pivoted at one end, moves nine racks ("straight gears") endwise by distances proportional to their distance from the lever's pivot. Each rack has a <b>drive</b> <b>pin</b> that is moved by the slot. The rack for [...] is closest to the pivot, of course.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Drive</b> <b>Pin</b> - A <b>drive</b> <b>pin</b> is {{a special}} nail-like {{fastener}} designed to permanently attach one material to another, such as wood to concrete or wood to steel. Head diameters vary in size from 1/4" [...] to 3/8". However, for additional head bearing in conjunction with soft materials, washers, of larger diameters are either fastened through or made part of the <b>drive</b> <b>pin</b> assembly.|$|E
50|$|A carrier is {{most often}} used when turning between centers on a lathe, {{but it may be}} used on {{dividing}} heads or any similar situation. It is used in conjunction with a drive plate and drive pins: the plate is mounted directly on the machine spindle (as with a chuck) and the <b>drive</b> <b>pin</b> is attached to the plate. In use the carrier and workpiece are inserted between centers and the leg of the carrier rests against the <b>drive</b> <b>pin.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The figure {{shows the}} motions curves for an {{external}} four-slots Geneva drive, in arbitrary units. There is a discontinuity in the acceleration when the <b>drive</b> <b>pin</b> enters {{and leaves the}} slot. This generates an [...] "infinite" [...] peak of jerk (Dirac peak), and therefore vibrations.|$|E
50|$|Carriers {{may be of}} the {{straight}} leg or bent leg type. The straight leg requires the <b>drive</b> <b>pin,</b> the bent leg fits into a slot machined into the drive plate. The bent leg type is considered safer as there are (slightly) fewer protruding parts to cause accidents.|$|E
50|$|The {{combustion}} chamber is {{in two parts}} and is normally open to the atmosphere. When the contact tip is pushed onto a piece of work, the lower piston chamber (which also serves as the piston bore) is pushed into the upper part, sealing it. Simultaneously, a metered amount of fuel is squirted into the chamber from the fuel cell. When the trigger is pulled, a spark plug ignites the fuel charge, pushes the piston and connected <b>drive</b> <b>pin</b> {{to the bottom of}} the chamber, and drives a nail. A small amount of combustion gas is briefly stored in a side chamber and is used to push the piston back into the ready position after the nail is driven.|$|E
50|$|The Cylindrical Energy Module is a sine-wave {{swashplate}} {{engine that}} {{can also be used}} as a standalone pump, powered by an external source. The rotating swashplate rotor assembly is moved back and forth with the help of piston <b>drive</b> <b>pins,</b> which follow a stationary sinusoidal cam track that encircles the rotor assembly.|$|R

Supports static, 2-mux, 3-mux, 4-mux, 5-mux, 6-mux, 7-mux, 8-mux (1/3 bias) LCDs. Segment and Common pins may be reprogrammed to available LCD <b>drive</b> <b>pins.</b> This peripheral may be driven in LPM3.5 (RTC running+Main CPU core shutdown low-power mode).|$|R
50|$|SATA 2.6 is {{the first}} {{revision}} that defined the slimline connector, intended for smaller form-factors such as notebook optical <b>drives.</b> <b>Pin</b> 1 of the slimline signal connector, denoting device presence, is shorter than the others to allow hot-swapping. The slimline signal connector is identical and compatible with the standard version, while the power connector is reduced to six pins so it supplies only +5 V, and not +12 V or +3.3 V.|$|R
50|$|However, two {{different}} basic mechanisms, the Mercedes-Euklid and the Marchant, move the dials at speeds {{corresponding to the}} digit being added or subtracted; a 1 moves the accumulator the slowest, and a 9, the fastest. In the Mercedes-Euklid, a long slotted lever, pivoted at one end, moves nine racks ("straight gears") endwise by distances proportional to their distance from the lever's pivot. Each rack has a <b>drive</b> <b>pin</b> that is moved by the slot. The rack for 1 is closest to the pivot, of course.For each keyboard digit, a sliding selector gear, much {{like that in the}} Leibniz wheel, engages the rack that corresponds to the digit entered. Of course, the accumulator changes either on the forward or reverse stroke, but not both. This mechanism is notably simple and relatively easy to manufacture.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (MRI) system mainly consists of a large powerful magnet, a high power frequency tunable RF source, several receivers, L-C parallel resonance circuits, timing control unit, signal processing unit and a T/R switching unit. In {{order to protect the}} receivers from overload, and to obtain clear images the switching unit should meet the several requirements: low insertion, high isolation and fast switching speed. Such a switching unit with 1. 5 Kilowatts handling capability is presented employing PIN diodes as key elements. This paper consists of four parts. (1) how to specify a PIN diode; (2) how to drive a PIN diode, and then presents a new method to <b>drive</b> <b>PIN</b> diode. It is no need to utilize neither optocoupler nor isolated power; (3) how to design a switch employing PIN diodes. (4) A simulation for the switch was performed to analyze its approximately specifications in advance and some measured results of the actual switch are shown...|$|E

Traditional multiplexing takes many more <b>pins</b> to <b>drive</b> {{the same number of}} LEDs; 2n pins must be used to drive n2 LEDs (though a 1-of-n decoder chip can be used {{to reduce the number of}} microcontroller I/O pins to [...] ).|$|R
50|$|Note the {{connections}} to the common ground bus from sockets 2 (top left), 19 (center bottom row), 22, 24, 26, 30, and 40 on all connectors. Also note (enlarged detail, bottom, looking from {{the opposite side of}} the connector) that socket 34 of the blue connector does not contact any conductor but unlike socket 34 of the other two connectors, it does connect to the common ground bus. On the gray connector, note that socket 28 is completely missing, so that pin 28 of the drive attached to the gray connector will be open. On the black connector, sockets 28 and 34 are completely normal, so that pins 28 and 34 of the drive attached to the black connector will be connected to the cable. Pin 28 of the black <b>drive</b> reaches <b>pin</b> 28 of the host receptacle but not pin 28 of the gray <b>drive,</b> while <b>pin</b> 34 of the black <b>drive</b> reaches <b>pin</b> 34 of the gray <b>drive</b> but not <b>pin</b> 34 of the host. Instead, pin 34 of the host is grounded.|$|R

In the second quarter, the Texans {{responded with a}} 23-yard field goal by kicker Kris Brown. The Ravens would punt on the ensuing <b>drive,</b> <b>pinning</b> the Texans at their 3-yard line. On the next play, Texans OT Duane Brown committed a holding penalty while in his own endzone, giving the Ravens a safety. Baltimore would increase their lead as rookie kicker Steven Hauschka got a 54-yard field goal. The Texans would close out the half as Brown nailed a 48-yard field goal.|$|R

50|$|With Western Digital {{hard disk}} <b>drives,</b> <b>Pin</b> 11 of the SATA Power Interface {{controls}} whether Staggered Spin-Up (SSU) is enabled or not. Pin 11 {{is also used}} as an activity LED connection. When the drive is initially powered on, the <b>drive</b> senses whether <b>Pin</b> 11 is left floating (high or '1' logic state) or grounded (low or '0' logic state). SSU is disabled when Pin 11 is grounded. When disabled, the drive will spin-up as soon as power is applied to it. SSU is enabled when Pin 11 is left floating or driven high (high or '1' logic state). The drive will not spin-up until the SATA Phy Interface becomes active with a connection to a SATA controller or SATA RAID controller. The SATA or SATA RAID controller can control when and how many drives can be spun-up. SSU and PUIS are features that are configured in software or firmware by the manufacturer.|$|R

40|$|A {{one piece}} {{reusable}} fastener capable of joining materials together {{from one side}} (blind backside) comprises a screw <b>driven</b> <b>pin</b> ending in a wedge-shaped expander cone. The cone cooperates within a slotted collar end which {{has a number of}} tangs on a cylindrical body. The fastener is set by inserting it through aligned holes in the workpieces to be joined. Turning the pin in one direction draws the cone into the collar, deforming the tangs radially outward to mate with tapered back-tapered hold in the workpiece, thus fastening the two pieces together. Reversing the direction of the pin withdraws the cone from the collar, and allows the tangs to resume their contracted configuration without withdrawing the fastener from the insertion hole. The fastener is capable of joining materials together from only one side with substantial strength in tension and shear over many resue attachment cycles, with no special operations on the main assembly parts other than the tapering of the back end of the insertion hole...|$|R

6000|$|Rollo {{asked his}} mother {{if she would}} not be kind enough to help them fix their apparatus; but she said she would give them {{particular}} directions, though she should prefer letting them do the whole themselves, and then, if they met with any difficulties, they might come and report them to her, and she would tell them how to surmount them. So she recommended to them to go and find a blank card, or piece of white pasteboard, or of stiff white paper, as big as a common card. [...] "Then," [...] said she, [...] "choose some window where the sun shines in at noon, and put the card down upon the sill, and <b>drive</b> the <b>pin</b> down through it. But you must not <b>drive</b> the <b>pin</b> through the middle of the card, for the shadow will always be off {{to the north of the}} pin, and therefore the pin may be pretty near the south end of the card. Then the shadow will be more likely to come wholly upon the card, even when it is longest. You had better place the card in such a position, too, that its sides shall lie in the direction of north and south. Then the shadow at noon will lie along exactly in the middle of it. You must get a large and stout <b>pin,</b> too; and <b>drive</b> it in firmly, a little way, with a small hammer. It will be well, too, to <b>drive</b> another smaller <b>pin</b> into the other end of the card, so as to keep it fixed in its north and south position." ...|$|R
50|$|When a {{cartridge}} {{is not in}} a <b>drive,</b> the <b>pin</b> is held {{in place}} {{at the opening of the}} cartridge with a small spring. A common reason for a cartridge failing to load into a drive is the misplacement of the leader pin as a result of the cartridge having been dropped.

The Eagles led 7-0, the Philadelphia crowd was deafening, and the Eagles now looked certain to cruise to victory. The Buccaneers recovered quickly, driving for a 48-yard Martin Gramatica field goal on their first possession. The Eagles punted on their next <b>drive,</b> <b>pinning</b> Tampa Bay at their own 4-yard line. On 3rd-and-2 from the Tampa 24-yard line, quarterback Brad Johnson hit Joe Jurevicius on a crossing route over the middle. Jurevicius badly beat veteran safety Blaine Bishop, who was playing injured, on the coverage {{and ran down the}} sideline {{all the way to the}} Eagle 5-yard line. The 71-yard play turned the tide of the game and Mike Alstott finished the drive with a touchdown to put Tampa Bay ahead 10-7. In the second quarter, Philadelphia drove into the Tampa Bay red zone and tied the game with a 30-yard David Akers field goal. However, the Buccaneers began a 12-play drive on the ensuing kickoff that ended in a 9-yard touchdown pass from Brad Johnson to Keyshawn Johnson, making it 17-10 Tampa Bay. Donovan McNabb took the Eagles back into Tampa Bay territory before halftime, but Simeon Rice sacked McNabb and recovered the resultant fumble.|$|R
