5|$|Around 00:15, the {{stewards}} began {{ordering the}} passengers {{to put on}} their lifebelts, though again, many passengers took the order as a joke. Some set about playing an impromptu game of association football with the ice chunks that were now strewn across the <b>foredeck.</b>|$|E
5|$|Thrust is {{provided}} by four Rolls-Royce Mermaid azimuth thruster type podded propulsion units, each featuring one forward-facing low-vibration propeller with separately bolted blades. The forward pair of thrusters is fixed, but the aft pair can swivel through 360°, removing {{the need for a}} rudder. The Queen Mary 2 is the first quadruple-propeller passenger ship completed since the SS France in 1961. Queen Mary 2 carries eight spare blades on the <b>foredeck,</b> immediately forward of the bridge screen.|$|E
5|$|The cockpit in the Sea Harrier {{includes}} a conventional centre stick arrangement and left-hand throttle. In addition to normal flight controls, the Harrier has a lever for controlling {{the direction of}} the four vectorable nozzles. The nozzles point rearward with the lever in the forward position for horizontal flight. With the lever back, the nozzles point downward for vertical takeoff or landing. The usefulness of the vertical landing capability of the Sea Harrier was demonstrated in an incident on 6 June 1983, when Sub Lieutenant Ian Watson lost contact with the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious and had to land Sea Harrier ZA176 on the <b>foredeck</b> of the Spanish cargo ship Alraigo.|$|E
50|$|The Kennedy is {{currently}} {{planned to be}} retired in 2020, along with the two Barberi-class ferries. These three vessels {{will be replaced by}} a new trio of ferries, collectively known as the Ollis-class. The design of this new class will be heavily influenced by the Kennedy, featuring its distinctive outdoor promenades and extended <b>foredecks.</b>|$|R
5|$|Italian {{ships of}} Mussolini's navy {{retained}} its pre-war scheme of light gray overall for its smaller ships, but the larger units mostly had dazzle camouflage of dark gray, light sea blue, light sea green and light gray. Italian <b>foredecks</b> had a high-visibility pattern {{of red and}} white diagonal stripes so that their own aircraft would not attack them.|$|R
5000|$|She {{displaces}} approximately 90 LT, and her {{top speed}} is approximately [...] [...] The class {{is designed for}} missions lasting up to three days. Marine Protector cutters are lightly armed, with all but the four owned by the US Navy mounting a main armament {{of a pair of}} crew-served fifty caliber Browning machine guns, on either side of their <b>foredecks.</b>|$|R
5|$|Tirpitz was {{rendered}} {{unfit for}} combat by Operation Paravane. The Tallboy bomb that struck the battleship {{passed through the}} <b>foredeck</b> and hull, and exploded in the water on the starboard side of her bow. This damage wrecked the bow, and left the battleship's forward compartments flooded with 2,000 tons of water. The explosions of several other Tallboys in the water near Tirpitz also buckled some of her hull plates and bulkheads. The battleship's casualties were not heavy, with five men killed and fifteen wounded. The damage was assessed as needing nine months' worth of work to repair. After reporting on the damage, Tirpitzs commanding officer, Kapitän zur See Wolf Junge, recommended to the German Navy's high command that the battleship be removed from service.|$|E
5|$|The German {{flotilla}} {{had reached}} home ports {{on the evening}} of the 12 February. However, while the threat from RAF bombers in daylight had now gone, Bomber Command was soon making night bombing attacks on Kiel’s port. Gneisenau was moved into an inner basin alongside her depot ship, Monte Olivia. The hatches were left open and her tanks, still containing a large amount of fuel, were left unattended. RAF Bomber Command made its first attack {{on the night of the}} 25/26 February, when 61 bombers flew over Kiel. Monte Olivia was destroyed but Gneisenau escaped. On 26/27 February another 61 RAF bombers returned. A bomb penetrated Gneisenaus <b>foredeck</b> and exploded. The oil fumes from the tanks ignited and the ship was engulfed in fire from her bow to the Anton turret. The entire forward part of the bow needed to be replaced. She steamed to Gdynia, in Poland on 4 April where she was decommissioned out of range of RAF bombers. Gneisenau did not put to sea again. The raid cost three aircraft, one Hampton and two Wellingtons. German casualties amounted to 16 civilians and 116 sailors dead.|$|E
5|$|Within {{minutes of}} the British attack, Ceylon {{surrendered}} and boats from Magicienne sought but failed to take possession of her. The French crew drove the captured East Indiaman on shore, joined shortly afterwards by Minerve, Bellone and later by Victor, so that by 6:30 pm the entire French force was grounded and all but Bellone prevented from firing their main broadsides by beached ships blocking their arc of fire. Bellone however was ideally positioned to maintain her fire on Nereide from her beached position, and at 7:00 pm a cannon shot cut Nereides stern anchor cable. The British frigate swung around, presenting her stern to Bellone and pulling both her broadsides away from the French squadron. Raked by Bellone and desperate to return fire, Willoughby had the bow anchor cable cut, bringing {{a portion of his}} ship's starboard broadside to bear on Bellone. At 8:00 pm, Duperré was seriously wounded in the cheek by shrapnel from a grape shot fired by Nereide; Ensign Vigoureux concealed his unconscious body under a signal flag and discreetly brought him below decks while Bouvet assumed command of the French squadron on board Bellone, placing Lieutenant Albin Roussin in charge of Minerve. Building an improvised bridge between the French ships and the shore, Bouvet increased the men and ammunition reaching Bellone and thus significantly increased her rate of fire. He also had the rail removed between the <b>foredeck</b> and the quarterdeck of Minerve, and had iron hooks nailed to the freeboard below the starboard gangway as to provide attachment points for additional guns, thus building a continuous second deck on his frigate where he constituted a complete second battery. By 10:00 pm Nereide was a wreck, receiving shot from several sides, with most of her guns dismounted and casualties mounting to over 200: the first lieutenant was dying, the second was severely wounded and Willoughby's left eye had been dislodged from its socket by a wooden splinter. Recognising her battered state, Bouvet then diverted fire from Nereide to concentrate on Magicienne.|$|E
25|$|The {{next day}} (March 12) was {{given over to}} {{repairing}} the damage suffered by the gunboats, and giving them additional protection by placing cotton bales on the <b>foredecks.</b> Smith also landed a pair of 30-pounder Parrott guns, one from his flagship Rattler and the other from Forest Rose. He also sent ashore a 12-pounder howitzer. They were sited some 800 yards (730 m) from the fort, and were, like the guns in the fort, shielded by cotton bales covered with dirt.|$|R
25|$|Replenishment at sea {{can take}} place over the bow, over the stern, or amidship. Liquid and dry goods as well as {{passengers}} weighing up to 250 kilograms can be transferred this way. Vertical replenishment via helicopters {{can take place}} over the helideck and/or the <b>foredeck.</b>|$|E
25|$|Vitus Bering is an {{upgraded}} version of SCF Sakhalin, a similar icebreaking platform supply vessel built at Helsinki in 2005. Several modifications {{have been made}} to the original design, including adding a fourth main engine, but the hull form is nearly identical. The most noticeable external difference is the covered <b>foredeck,</b> which will protect the mooring equipment from icing.|$|E
25|$|Her {{armament}} {{consisted of}} six 14 cm/50 3rd Year Type naval guns in three turrets on the <b>foredeck,</b> giving Nisshin nearly the firepower {{of a light}} cruiser. Anti-aircraft protection was initially provided by 18 Type 96 25 mm AA guns in eight twin and two single mountings. An additional 18 sets were installed in early 1943.|$|E
25|$|On {{the main}} deck above, the <b>foredeck</b> cabin {{included}} the officers' quarters, a first-class kitchen complete with French maitré de cuisine, and, in another innovation, a barber's shop, with patented adjustable chair. The aft cabin, which {{connected to the}} saloon below, contained the men's smoking room. This cabin also housed the helmsman, with whom the captain communicated by a bell signal. The captain also communicated with the engine room {{by means of a}} mechanical signalling device.|$|E
25|$|One bomb hit Diamonds engine room, {{stopping}} her {{engines and}} bringing down her funnel, mast and radio aerial. Another {{exploded in the}} sea off her port side, holing her hull below her <b>foredeck.</b> Her engine room petty officer, H.T. Davis, had been on deck, but rushed below and released the pressure from her No. 3 boiler to prevent {{the risk of a}} boiler explosion. She sank in eight minutes. Both of her lifeboats were destroyed, but her crew launched her three Carley floats.|$|E
25|$|The first steam {{boats were}} made of wood, but steel hulls were soon {{introduced}} and were divided into watertight compartments. They were well designed for the crew with a large building that contained the wheelhouse and the deckhouse. The boats built in the 20th century only had a mizzen sail, which was used to help steady the boat when its nets were out. The main function of the mast was now as a crane for lifting the catch ashore. It also had a steam capstan on the <b>foredeck</b> near the mast for hauling nets. These boats had a crew of twelve {{made up of a}} skipper, driver, fireman (to look after the boiler) and nine deck hands.|$|E
25|$|In 1912, Hibernia hosted {{trials in}} naval {{aviation}} with the temporary {{addition of a}} runway to her <b>foredeck,</b> and the first launch of an aircraft from a vessel underway was achieved from her in early May. Later in 1912, after her experiment with aviation was completed, {{she and her sister}} ships formed the 3rd Battle Squadron. The squadron was assigned to the Grand Fleet at the beginning of World War I, and served on the Northern Patrol. In 1915 she supported the Dardanelles Campaign and provided cover for the evacuation from the Gallipoli Peninsula. On returning to the United Kingdom she was again attached to the Grand Fleet before being transferred to Nore Command in May 1916, finishing the war as an accommodation ship. She was decommissioned in 1919 and scrapped in 1922.|$|E
25|$|In 1911, Lieutenant Longmore and Oswald Short {{installed}} streamlined {{air bags}} on the undercarriage struts and under the tail of Improved S.27 No. 38 to enable the aircraft to land on water. On 1 December 1911, Longmore used the aircraft {{to become the first}} person in the United Kingdom to take off from land and make a successful water landing when he landed in the river Medway off Sheerness, after which No.38 was brought ashore and flown back to Eastchurch. A flying-off platform was constructed over the <b>foredeck</b> and forward 12-inch (305mm) gun turret of the pre-dreadnought battleship HMS Africa, and on 10 January 1912 Samson, piloting No.38, used the platform while Africa was anchored off Sheerness to make the United Kingdom’s first successful aeroplane take-off from a ship. The platform was later transferred to the battleship HMS Hibernia.|$|E
25|$|The first steam {{boats were}} made of wood, but steel hulls were soon {{introduced}} and were divided into watertight compartments. They were well designed for the crew with a large building that contained the wheelhouse and the deckhouse. The boats built in the 20th century only had a mizzen sail, which was used to help steady the boat when its nets were out. The main function of the mast was now as a crane for lifting the catch ashore. It also had a steam capstan on the <b>foredeck</b> near the mast for hauling nets. The boats had narrow, high funnels so that the steam and thick coal smoke was released high above the deck {{and away from the}} fishermen. These funnels were nicknamed woodbines because they looked like the popular brand of cigarette. These boats had a crew of twelve made up of a skipper, driver, fireman (to look after the boiler) and nine deck hands.|$|E
25|$|While Sampo had {{not been}} damaged in the war, she was docked at the Hietalahti {{shipyard}} for extensive maintenance and repairs — when she left to the port of Hanko in mid-February 1919, 69 bottom plates had been replaced. In December 1922 Sampo struck a rock in the port of Loviisa and her bow propeller shaft was damaged, {{but there was no}} time for repairs and for the rest of the season she had to assist ships to the port of Helsinki without her bow propeller. Another incident occurred on 24 March 1926 when the bow propeller of Sampo hit a stone bank in the port of Helsinki, came loose and dropped to the bottom. It was found after searching for a couple of days and winched on board. On 30 March, while Sampo was assisting a Finnish steamship Albert Kasimir, the stern propeller shaft snapped when the engine was reversed and the propeller dropped to the bottom. While the icebreaker still had its bow propeller, it was of no use as it was waiting for installation on the <b>foredeck.</b> Murtaja towed the immobilized icebreaker to Hanko on the following day and to Helsinki for repairs on 20 April.|$|E
500|$|Ramming Cumberland nearly {{resulted}} in the sinking of Virginia as well. [...] Virginia's bow ram got stuck in the enemy ship's hull, and as Cumberland listed and began to go down, she almost pulled Virginia under with her. At the time the vessels were locked, one of Cumberland's anchors was hanging directly above the <b>foredeck</b> of Virginia. Had it come loose, the two ships might have gone down together. Virginia broke free, however, her ram breaking off as she backed away.|$|E
500|$|Ten 37 mm/50cal {{semi-automatic}} AA {{guns were}} carried by Pluton. Two were fitted on the <b>foredeck,</b> six amidships between the funnels and two {{on a platform}} at the stern. 10,000rounds were carried with 144 rounds in ready-use boxes near each gun. The guns could depress 15° and elevate to 80°. They fired [...] shells at a muzzle velocity of [...] Their effective anti-aircraft range was less than [...] All of these guns—except for the pair on the stern—were removed shortly after Pluton was commissioned in 1932.|$|E
500|$|Prinz Eugen was [...] long overall, {{and had a}} beam of [...] and {{a maximum}} draft of [...] After launching, her {{straight}} bow was replaced with a clipper bow, increasing the length overall to [...] The new bow kept her <b>foredeck</b> much drier in heavy weather. The ship had a design displacement of [...] and a full-load displacement of [...] Prinz Eugen was powered by three sets of geared steam turbines, which were supplied with steam by twelve ultra-high pressure oil-fired boilers. The ship's top speed was , at [...] As designed, her standard complement consisted of 42 officers and 1,340 enlisted men.|$|E
500|$|A {{memorial}} plaque {{was laid}} on the <b>foredeck</b> of Centaur on 12 January 2010, during the fourth and final ROV dive on the hospital ship. This would normally be a breach of the Historic Shipwrecks Act, but a special dispensation permitted the manoeuvre, as placing the plaque on the seabed next to the ship would have seen it sink into the sediment. Following the ship's discovery, a national memorial service at St John's Cathedral, Brisbane on 2 March 2010 was attended by over 600 people, including Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. A second ceremony for 300 relatives of the hospital ship's personnel was held aboard [...] on 24 September. During the service, which occurred over the wreck site, wreaths were laid and the ashes of three survivors were scattered.|$|E
500|$|In 1936, an {{experimental}} twin 13.2mm gun mount {{with a gun}} shield was added between the starboard 75-mm guns and more rangefinders were added to bring her total up to 31. Her boilers and condensers were repaired in a refit between 25 November 1936 and 13 March 1937. Later that year Pluton had a major refit that involved repair of her turbines, replacement of her 138mm fire-control director {{by one of the}} type used by the [...] light cruisers and the transfer of the <b>foredeck</b> 13.2mm machine guns to positions on the forward superstrucut. Her last refit, from 15 November 1938 – 15 February 1939, retubed two boilers, enclosed the AA director to protect it from the weather, improved the remote control of the 138mm guns and added gun shields to each of the twin 13.2mm mounts.|$|E
500|$|She entered {{service with}} the French Mediterranean Fleet in 1932. Pluton {{experienced}} many teething problems, {{particularly with the}} machinery. Shortly after she was commissioned the Navy decided to give her an extra role as a gunnery training ship and she entered Toulon Dockyard for the necessary modifications on 24 October 1932. Quarters for 40 men were added on the mine deck. Most of the 37-mm AA guns {{and all of the}} 8mm machine guns were replaced by four 50-caliber 75mm Canon de 75mm Mle 22 or 24 AA guns and 12 [...] Hotchkiss machine guns on six twin mounts, two mounts where the 37mm guns had been mounted on the <b>foredeck</b> and four between the funnels. The 75mm guns had a maximum depression of 10° and a maximum elevation of 90°. They fired a [...] shell at a muzzle velocity of [...] at a rate of fire of 8–18 rounds per minute and had a maximum effective ceiling of [...] The Hotchkiss guns had a cyclic rate of fire of 450 rounds per minute, but the practical rate was between 200 and 250 rounds per minute to allow for reloading its 30-round magazines. They had a theoretical ceiling of [...] A simple fire-control director was added for the 138mm guns and 15 additional rangefinders were installed for use by the Rangefinding School.|$|E
2500|$|PT PAL {{confirmed}} that the SSVs will be designed to support one [...] gun on the <b>foredeck</b> as the main armament. Two stern-facing [...] guns will also be fitted, one each on the port and starboard sides.|$|E
2500|$|The upgrade {{involved}} stripping all the weaponry {{and missile}} launcher tubes from the ship's <b>foredeck</b> {{to make way}} for a [...] "short take-off but arrested recovery" [...] (STOBAR) configuration, converting the Gorshkov from a hybrid carrier/cruiser to a pure carrier.|$|E
2500|$|In 1907, {{there were}} gold strikes in the Portland Canal area. [...] Servicing these strikes became a {{profitable}} {{business for the}} Camosun. [...] In 1909, the Union Steamship company acquired a mail contract. [...] Other cargo carried at this time included fifty head of cattle carried on the <b>foredeck.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The reconstructed Alice was a {{significant}} improvement over the original steamer. [...] The cabin structure, called the “house” was completely new. [...] Additional space was left on the <b>foredeck,</b> {{so that there was}} more room for the crew to move on the deck, and also to stack additional freight.|$|E
2500|$|The hull of Chester was flexible, {{being kept}} in its proper shape by system of hog posts and hog chains. [...] This {{combination}} of posts and chains {{held up the}} boiler, stern and <b>foredeck,</b> and held down the points where the hog posts were stepped. [...] The hull was designed to bend without breaking any of the joints or causing the caulking to break out from between the planks.|$|E
2500|$|For {{loading and}} {{unloading}} of general cargo, containers and bulk cargo the ships are geared with four deck cranes located on the centerline, one on the aft deck and three forwards of the superstructure. The No. 2 crane on the <b>foredeck</b> is a twin type crane with a lifting capacity of 2 × 40 tonnes at [...] while the others are single hydraulic cranes, capable of lifting 20 tonnes, with a maximum outreach of [...]|$|E
2500|$|Around noon on 11 August the [...] started hunting her. Clan Macarthur was {{proceeding}} at {{full speed}} on a zigzag course, {{and it was not}} until the small hours of 12 August that the submarine managed to hit her. At 0332 hrs two G7a torpedoes hit Clan Macarthurs port side. One blew off her twin propellers and extinguished all her lights. The other hit her further forward, fracturing her <b>foredeck</b> across her beam. Many of her Lascar crew were trapped in their quarters.|$|E
2500|$|Initially President Sukarno and Vice-president Hatta {{opposed the}} agreement, but after hearing reports of {{shortages}} of ammunition and worried that Dutch would attack again if the agreement not signed, they agreed. They were also reluctant {{to accept responsibility}} for substantial civilian and military casualties if the fighting continued. After the Dutch and republican sides agreed on a truce along the Van Mook Line and the proposals put forward by the CGO and the Dutch, the agreement was signed on the <b>foredeck</b> of USS Renville on 17 January 1948 ...|$|E
2500|$|Curlew was {{purchased}} for $44,000 by the U.S.Navy in 1861 for the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. [...] She was outfitted as a gunboat with armament {{consisting of a}} 30-pounder rifled gun on the <b>foredeck</b> and six 32-pounder smoothbores on the main deck. [...] Curlew participated in the expedition to Port Royal, S.C. {{under the command of}} Acting Lieutenant P.G. Watmough. When her machinery proved to be inadequate she was towed to New York by the transport Baltic arriving on 21 November 1861 to be returned to her owners before the sixty-day trial period expired.|$|E
2500|$|The R {{class were}} the first Royal Navy {{submarines}} to be fitted with six bow torpedo tubes, number of torpedoes being considered more important than range or size of warhead carried when attacking U-boats. The torpedo tubes were originally the smaller [...] but later changed to 21 inch (533 mm). As designed, one spare torpedo was allowed for, but in operation six reloads were carried {{in place of the}} senior ratings' accommodation. It was originally intended to fit a [...] gun on the <b>foredeck,</b> but this was dropped due to the adverse effect it would have had on submerged speed.|$|E
