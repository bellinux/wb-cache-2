5|$|At {{a session}} of the Arab League's Joint Defence Council on January 27–30, 1973, Egypt {{presented}} a report stressing that an attack against Israel {{would have to be}} carried out simultaneously from Egypt, Syria and Jordan because of the <b>Israeli</b> <b>air</b> superiority. According to the report, Egypt and Syria's air forces, if reinforced with 16 air squadrons from other Arab countries would achieve numerical superiority. However, the Israelis offset this by superior training, avionics, aircraft payload and weaponry. A simultaneous Arab attack could dilute the effectiveness of the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Air</b> Force (IAF), and would force Israeli ground forces to fight a two-front war.|$|E

50|$|In July 2006, a {{group of}} Hezbollah fighters crossed from {{southern}} Lebanon into northern Israel killing three Israeli soldiers and abducting two, which started the Lebanon-Israeli war. Faced with <b>Israeli's</b> <b>air</b> attacks, Hezbollah needed to create a defensive system that would enable these rocket attacks to continue uninterrupted throughout any conflict with Israel. To do so they created an intricate system of tunnels and underground bunkers, anti-tank units, and explosive-ridden areas.|$|R

5|$|The Egyptian army {{unleashed}} {{its full}} anti-aircraft arsenal and hit Alon's plane, {{but he managed}} to crash-land unharmed at 20:05, performing a ground loop. Weizmann landed at 20:15. Eddie Cohen, a volunteer pilot from South Africa, crashed and died, although it is unknown whether he was hit by anti-aircraft fire, or a technical problem caused the plane to malfunction. A report by Dan Tolkovsky, the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Air</b> Force operations officer at the time, stated that Cohen likely attempted to land at the Hatzor Airbase instead of Ekron, where eyewitnesses saw a burning plane crashing in the distance. He was the first <b>Israeli</b> <b>Air</b> Force KIA, and was buried in Tel Aviv (Nahalat Yitzhak) after his remains were found at the end of 1949.|$|E
50|$|The Egyptians {{were caught}} by surprise, and {{nearly the entire}} Egyptian air force was {{destroyed}} with few Israeli losses, giving the <b>Israelis</b> <b>air</b> superiority. Simultaneously, the Israelis launched a ground offensive into the Gaza Strip and the Sinai, which again caught the Egyptians by surprise. After some initial resistance, Egyptian leader Gamal Abdel Nasser ordered the evacuation of the Sinai. Israeli forces rushed westward {{in pursuit of the}} Egyptians, inflicted heavy losses, and conquered the Sinai.|$|R

5|$|The 1967 war {{severely}} depleted Egypt's military strength, as most {{of their}} air force and a large quantity of equipment was destroyed. Soviet assistance helped the Egyptian military to start the rebuilding of their armed forces shortly after the war, and by September 1968 Egyptian ground forces sufficiently recovered to challenge the Israeli presence east of the Suez canal. The War of Attrition began with Egyptian artillery barrages and commando raids into the Sinai, which were countered by deep-striking Israeli airstrikes and heli-borne raids into Egypt. Egypt's inability to challenge <b>Israeli</b> <b>air</b> superiority led to the deployment of Soviet-operated air-defense assets to protect parts of Egypt's interior, deterring the Israelis from launching their deep penetration raids and allowing the Egyptians to rebuild their air defenses. The defensive upgrades incurred increasing <b>Israeli</b> <b>air</b> losses, leading to an August 1970 ceasefire that lasted until 1973. Nasser died in September 1970 and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 June, the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Air</b> Force struck Egyptian air fields, {{destroying}} much of the Egyptian Air Force. Before the day ended, Israeli armored units had cut through Egyptian defense lines and captured the town of el-Arish. The next day, Amer ordered the immediate withdrawal of Egyptian troops from Sinai—causing the majority of Egyptian casualties during the war. Israel quickly captured Sinai and the Gaza Strip from Egypt, the West Bank from Jordan, and the Golan Heights from Syria.|$|E
5|$|Starting {{at sunrise}} on October 20, the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Air</b> Force {{launched}} aerial attacks {{for the duration}} of the day, targeting Ismailia, the nearby al-Galaa' army base, and Jebel Mariam. Close air support was also provided to advancing ground forces. Israeli aircraft employed ordnance fitted with time fuses, as well as napalm to demoralize Egyptian troops. Shazly left Ismailia that evening, returning to Cairo where he presented a grim evaluation of the military situation to GHQ. His recommendation to withdraw armored forces to counter the Israeli threat on the west bank created a serious command crisis, and ultimately no withdrawal took place.|$|E

5|$|The F-16's first air-to-air combat {{success was}} {{achieved}} by the <b>Israeli</b> <b>Air</b> Force (IAF) over the Bekaa Valley on 28 April 1981, against a Syrian Mi-8 helicopter, which was downed with cannon fire. On 7 June 1981, eight Israeli F-16s, escorted by F-15s, executed Operation Opera, their first employment in a significant air-to-ground operation. This raid severely damaged Osirak, an Iraqi nuclear reactor under construction near Baghdad, to prevent the regime of Saddam Hussein from using the reactor {{for the creation of}} nuclear weapons.|$|E
5|$|A large {{force of}} Israeli {{infantry}} and armor went east {{to block the}} road from Salt to the Allenby bridge, and they encountered the Jordanian 60th Armored Brigade trying to join the defense of Karameh. In the resulting battle, the Jordanians lost eight Patton tanks without destroying any Israeli tanks, then withdrew to the hills to dig in and continue firing down on the Israelis. The <b>Israeli</b> <b>Air</b> Force launched airstrikes against Jordanian armor and artillery positions, {{but was unable to}} stop the firing. Within the next two hours, Israeli artillery fire and airstrikes were launched against Jordanian defenses on the Musri-Karameh road, the Salt road, and east of Abdullah Bridge. The Israelis also consolidated their hold on Karameh with airstrikes and artillery, and began demolishing the camp. A total of 175 houses were blown up.|$|E
5|$|At 6:30AM, Israeli {{helicopters}} started landing {{the bulk}} of the paratrooper battalion north of Karameh. An Israeli aircraft was supposed to drop leaflets addressed to Fatah, after the paratroopers had surrounded the town; however, due to difficult weather conditions, the helicopters flying the paratroopers arrived twenty minutes too late. Met with resistance by Fatah commandos and Jordanian regulars supported by Jordanian artillery, the paratroopers suffered heavy losses. When the southern task force began their drive north towards Karameh, they encountered a Jordanian infantry brigade supported by armor, artillery and antitank weapons. The <b>Israeli</b> <b>Air</b> Force launched airstrikes, but was only able to inflict minor damage on the dug-in Jordanians. Fighting from their entrenched positions, the Jordanians repelled several Israeli assaults.|$|E

5|$|In March 2008, a {{coalition}} of human rights groups charged that the Israeli blockade of the city had caused the humanitarian situation in Gaza to have reached its worst point since Israel occupied the territory in the 1967 Six-Day War, and that <b>Israeli</b> <b>air</b> strikes targeting militants in the densely populated areas have often killed bystanders as well. In 2008, Israel commenced an assault against Gaza. Israel stated the strikes were in response to repetitive rocket and mortar attacks from the Gaza Strip into Israel since 2005, while the Palestinians stated that they were responding to Israel's military incursions and blockade of the Gaza Strip. In January 2009, at least 1,300 Palestinians {{were killed in the}} conflict.|$|E
5|$|On 4 September 2003, three <b>Israeli</b> <b>Air</b> Force F-15 Eagles {{performed}} a fly-over of Auschwitz-Birkenau during a {{ceremony at the}} camp below.

On 27 January 2015, some 300 Auschwitz survivors and other guests gathered under a giant tent {{at the entrance to}} Auschwitz II Birkenau to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the camp's liberation. Attendees included president of the World Jewish Congress Ronald Lauder, film director Steven Spielberg, and world leaders such as Polish president Bronisław Komorowski and King Willem-Alexander of the Netherlands.

50|$|The issue {{remained}} unresolved {{until late}} 2006 {{when it was}} announced that the airport would be vacated to make way for residential redevelopment. It is unclear, however, when this will actually take place as the Tel Aviv municipality, the <b>Israeli</b> domestic <b>air</b> carriers and other interests such as the general aviation community oppose closing the airport.
