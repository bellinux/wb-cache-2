5000|$|Beginning in the 1940s, Cattell used several {{techniques}} {{including the}} new statistical technique of common factor analysis applied to the English-language trait lexicon to elucidate the major underlying dimensions within the normal personality sphere. This method takes as its starting point the matrix of inter-correlations between these variables {{in an attempt to}} uncover the underlying source traits of human personality. Cattell found that personality structure was hierarchical, with both primary and secondary stratum level traits. At the primary level, the 16PF measures 16 primary trait constructs, with a version of the Big Five secondary traits at the secondary level. These higher-level factors emerged from factor-analyzing the 16 x 16 <b>intercorrelation</b> matrix for the sixteen primary factors themselves. The 16PF yields scores on primary and second-order [...] "global" [...] traits, thereby allowing a multilevel description of each individual's unique personality profile. A listing of these trait dimensions and their description can be found below. Cattell also found a third-stratum of personality organization that comprised just two overarching factors.|$|E
50|$|Multicollinearity often {{occurs in}} {{high-throughput}} biostatistical settings. Due to high <b>intercorrelation</b> between the predictors (such as gene expression levels), the information of one predictor might be contained in another one. It {{could be that}} only 5% of the predictors are responsible for 90% of the variability of the response. In such a case, one could apply the biostatistical technique of dimension reduction (for example via principal component analysis). Classical statistical techniques like linear or logistic regression and linear discriminant analysis do not work well for high dimensional data (i.e. {{when the number of}} observations n is smaller than the number of features or predictors p: n < p). As a matter of fact, one can get quite high R2-values despite very low predictive power of the statistical model. These classical statistical techniques (esp. least squares linear regression) were developed for low dimensional data (i.e. where the number of observations n is much larger than the number of predictors p: n >> p). In cases of high dimensionality, one should always consider an independent validation test set and the corresponding residual sum of squares (RSS) and R2 of the validation test set, not those of the training set.|$|E

The third essay dissects the strategic behavior of labor market participants as they compete with one another in the matching game that brings together employers and employees, and then extrapolates what that behavior means for the labor market as a whole in terms of unemployment and welfare. The last essay takes a more dynamic look at the labor market, treating it as an intergenerational matching game to investigate the phenomenon of economic stratification and to find out what effects policies aimed at improving intergenerational mobility might have on economic growth. ...|$|E
