40|$|Part 6 : Modelling and OptimizationInternational audienceAbstraction <b>in</b> model <b>checking</b> is {{the most}} {{effective}} method to overcome the state explosion problem, the most serious problem <b>in</b> model <b>checking</b> when the size and the complexity of the system-under-check are increasing. Unfortunately, when the abstraction goes wrong, the answer must be validated with the concrete system, so it faces the state explosion problem again. Moreover, the techniques <b>in</b> <b>checking</b> the abstraction and in validating must not be obstructions <b>in</b> the <b>checking</b> process. Research recently has shown that, the way to abstract a model and the approach to use abstraction are the main concerns <b>in</b> abstraction model <b>checking.</b> <b>In</b> this work, we report our study on both two questions: (1) a model analyzing method to find a way of abstraction effectively, and (2) an error refinement approach using multiple abstraction <b>in</b> symbolic model <b>checking.</b> The experimentation shows that the new approach has a great performance <b>in</b> <b>checking</b> both ‘buggy‘ and ‘correct‘ models...|$|R

5|$|When a king {{is under}} {{immediate}} attack {{by one or}} two of the opponent's pieces, it is said to be <b>in</b> <b>check.</b> A response to a check is a legal move if it results in a position where the king is no longer under direct attack (that is, not <b>in</b> <b>check).</b> This can involve capturing the checking piece; interposing a piece between the checking piece and the king (which is possible only if the attacking piece is a queen, rook, or bishop and there is a square between it and the king); or moving the king to a square where it is not under attack. Castling is not a permissible response to a check. The object of the game is to checkmate the opponent; this occurs when the opponent's king is <b>in</b> <b>check,</b> and there is no legal way to remove it from attack. It is illegal for a player to make a move that would put or leave the player's own king <b>in</b> <b>check.</b>|$|E

The International Civil Aviation Organization, a United Nations agency, also recommends prohibiting e-cigarettes <b>in</b> <b>checked</b> luggage. A spokesman for the Tobacco Vapor Electronic Cigarette Association said that e-cigarettes do not pose a problem if they are packed correctly in static-free packaging, but that irresponsible people may sometimes pack them carelessly or tamper with them. In-flight use of e-cigarettes is prohibited in the US.|$|R

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, some Roman writers, {{particularly}} Republican figures, used Alexander as {{a cautionary tale}} of how autocratic tendencies can be kept <b>in</b> <b>check</b> by republican values.

5|$|The Hokies {{were led}} on defense by All-America safety Frank Loria, who caught three interceptions and {{returned}} three punts for touchdowns {{as a junior}} during the 1966 season.

5|$|The king {{cannot be}} <b>in</b> <b>check,</b> nor can the king pass through squares {{that are under}} attack by enemy pieces, or move to a square where it {{would result in a}} check.

5|$|A {{challenger}} to Planica {{arrived in}} 1949 {{with the construction}} of Heini-Klopfer-Skiflugschanze ("Heini Klopfer ski flying hill") in Oberstdorf, West Germany. Designed by former ski jumper turned architect Heini Klopfer, as well as then-active ski jumpers Toni Brutscher and Sepp Weiler, the hill had a K-point of 120m to match that of Bloudkova velikanka. The FIS, still wary of the rising popularity of ski flying and wanting to keep it <b>in</b> <b>check,</b> refused to sanction the construction of the hill, having previously denounced the 1947 and 1948 events in Planica.|$|E

5|$|Except for {{any move}} of the knight and castling, pieces cannot jump over other pieces. A piece is {{captured}} (or taken) when an attacking enemy piece replaces {{it on its}} square (en passant is the only exception). The captured piece is thereby permanently removed from the game. The king can be put <b>in</b> <b>check</b> but cannot be captured (see below).|$|E
