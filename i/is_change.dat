25|$|The {{first line}} {{treatment}} <b>is</b> <b>change</b> of lifestyle (e.g., Dietary Guidelines for Americans and physical activity). However, if in {{three to six months}} of efforts at remedying risk factors prove insufficient, then drug treatment is frequently required. Generally, the individual disorders that compose the metabolic syndrome are treated separately. Diuretics and ACE inhibitors may be used to treat hypertension. Cholesterol drugs may be used to lower LDL cholesterol and triglyceride levels, if they are elevated, and to raise HDL levels if they are low. Use of drugs that decrease insulin resistance, e.g., metformin and thiazolidinediones, is controversial; this treatment is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Weight loss medications may result in weight loss. As obesity is often recognized as the culprit behind many of the additional symptoms, with weight loss and lifestyle changes in diet, physical activity, the need for other medications may diminish.|$|E

500|$|A {{major theme}} of the film <b>is</b> <b>change,</b> and people's {{response}} to that change. Meyer considered Valeris and Chang [...] "frightened people, who are frightened of change", who cling to old ways despite the changing world. He hoped that the fictionalization of a current events story allowed for an objective look at the issues, rather than being blinded by personal bias. At {{the beginning of the}} film, Kirk operates under a similar bias, calling the Klingons [...] "animals" [...] and putting him at odds with Spock. The Vulcan sees the Gorkon peace initiative as logical, responding to the sudden change in the status quo in a collected manner; he even opens the peace dialog at the behest of his father.|$|E

500|$|The word, [...] "untrimmed" [...] in line eight, can {{be taken}} two ways: First, {{in the sense of}} loss of {{decoration}} and frills, and second, in the sense of untrimmed sails on a ship. [...] In the first interpretation, the poem reads that beautiful things naturally lose their fanciness over time. [...] In the second, it reads that nature is a ship with sails not adjusted to wind changes in order to correct course. [...] This, in combination with the words [...] "nature's changing course", creates an oxymoron: the unchanging change of nature, or the fact that the only thing that does not change <b>is</b> <b>change.</b> [...] This line in the poem creates a shift from the mutability of the first eight lines, into the eternity of the last six. [...] Both change and eternity are then acknowledged and challenged by the final line.|$|E
500|$|Discussing her own {{reaction}} to the storyline, Smith has commented; [...] "I was psyched. I {{thought it was a}} great idea." [...] She revealed that the writers have not fully divulged Hahn's romantic backstory to her, explaining; [...] "a lot of it is still vague. I mean, there's what the writers think and what I've sort of thought, and in my mind. Maybe I had a crush in high school or in college or something— there was something, but I don't think it's ever— I think it might be her first time." [...] Continuing with this theme, Smith also spoke with Kristin Dos Santos for E! about her character's lack of definitive romantic history, jesting; [...] "I'll look at the script next week and be like [...] "Oh my God, I've been a lesbian for years and I didn't know." [...] She also discussed the meetings with GLAAD she and Ramirez attended, and their impact on her portrayal of the storyline, explaining: [...] "It was actually very helpful because they did talk about their own personal lives, and how, I guess if you're an open person, and life <b>is</b> <b>change,</b> then anything can happen. And it could really rock your world I imagine, if you all of a sudden thought that you might be in love with a woman and maybe you weren't before." ...|$|E

2500|$|Process {{philosophy}} {{embraces the}} Einsteinian world-view, {{and its main}} proponents include Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne. The core belief of process philosophy is the claim that events and processes are the principal ontological categories. Whitehead asserted in his book The Concept of Nature that the things in nature, what he referred to as [...] "concresences" [...] are a conjunction of events that maintain a permanence of character. Process philosophy is Heraclitan {{in the sense that}} a fundamental ontological category <b>is</b> <b>change.</b> Charles Hartshorne was also responsible for developing the process philosophy of Whitehead into process theology.|$|E

2500|$|An emf is induced in a coil or {{conductor}} {{whenever there}} <b>is</b> <b>change</b> in the flux linkages. Depending {{on the way}} in which the changes are brought about, there are two types: When the conductor is moved in a stationary magnetic field to procure a change in the flux linkage, the emf is statically induced. [...] The electromotive force generated by motion is often referred to as motional emf. [...] When the change in flux linkage arises from a change in the magnetic field around the stationary conductor, the emf is dynamically induced. The electromotive force generated by a time-varying magnetic field [...] is often referred to as transformer emf.|$|E
2500|$|A {{potential}} important {{influence on}} adolescence <b>is</b> <b>change</b> {{of the family}} dynamic, specifically divorce. With the divorce rate up to about 50%, divorce is common and adds to the already great amount of change in adolescence. Custody disputes soon after a divorce often reflect a playing out of control battles and ambivalence between parents. Divorce usually results in less contact between the adolescent and their noncustodial parent. [...] In extreme cases of instability and abuse in homes, divorce can {{have a positive effect}} on families due to less conflict in the home. However, most research suggests a negative effect on adolescence as well as later development. A recent study found that, compared with peers who grow up in stable post-divorce families, children of divorce who experience additional family transitions during late adolescence, make less progress in their math and social studies performance over time. Another recent study put forth a new theory entitled the adolescent epistemological trauma theory, which posited that traumatic life events such as parental divorce during the formative period of late adolescence portend lifelong effects on adult conflict behavior that can be mitigated by effective behavioral assessment and training. A parental divorce during childhood or adolescence continues to have a negative effect when a person is in his or her twenties and early thirties. These negative effects include romantic relationships and conflict style, meaning as adults, they are more likely to use the styles of avoidance and competing in conflict management.|$|E
2500|$|Another {{powerful}} argument hooks discusses is one {{in which}} she describes how starting from a very young age, boys and girls are constantly being knocked down and told to fit into the tiny boxes of characteristics that are expected of them. Hooks points out that the boy is denied his right to show, or even have, any true feelings. To further explain, she uses men in the American culture as an example, and describes how they have been socialized to mistrust the value and power of love. While the girl is taught {{that the most important thing}} she can do <b>is</b> <b>change</b> herself and her own feelings, with the hopes of attracting and pleasing everyone else. These unfair expectations lead boys and girls to grow up into men and women who are convinced that lies are the way to go, and no one should be showing their truest feelings to each other. This leads to the paradox hooks points out because in order to have a functional, and healthy loving relationship, honesty is a natural requirement. In bell hooks's own words, [...] "Lies may make people feel better, but they do not help them to know love" [...] (hooks). Another central argument in hooks's All About Love is the way in which it is almost impossible for women to find happiness in what she sees as a brutal culture where men are taught to worry more about sexual satisfaction and performance than actually loving someone. This reality pointed out by hooks, paired with the fact that women focus so strongly on obtaining themselves a partner, leads to most relationships being completely one sided. In this case, the men are emotionally satisfied, and the women are left without any true happiness. Hooks points out that despite these evident problems in modern-day love culture, love can be revived, and this is what she is arguing throughout her book.|$|E
