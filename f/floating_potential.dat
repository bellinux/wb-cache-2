30|$|While {{there are}} {{numerous}} papers on the solution of electrostatic field problems with <b>floating</b> <b>potentials</b> by boundary element methods and related methods, like the charge simulation method [2, 3], in the engineering literature, a detailed view based on a mathematically profound basis seems to be missing. In this paper, we try to close this gap and, in addition, compare several formulations in practical examples. In particular, we consider boundary element methods, see, e.g., [4 – 6], for the solution of electrostatic field problems with <b>floating</b> <b>potentials</b> in a multi-dielectric setting. We apply an indirect approach based on the single layer potential and a domain decomposition method based on symmetric approximations of the local Dirichlet to Neumann maps, the so-called Steklov-Poincaré operators, see e.g. [7 – 10]. These two methods have been compared for magnetostatic problems in [11, 12]. Here, we apply these formulations for electrodes at <b>floating</b> <b>potentials.</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceConsidering standards, {{the main}} source of far field emitted by power {{electronic}} structures is the common mode current generated by the <b>floating</b> <b>potentials</b> tracks. Moreover, due to the frequency and power increases, the compliance to EMC becomes more and more difficult. In consequence, it is necessary to investigate practical solutions to reduce the emitted field. A useful solution is the shielding of wounded components which are near field influent sources. But this solution may be not efficient for far field reduction and investigations concerning component placement can be a better and cheaper solution. A FE-PEEC hybrid method was developed and can be used to investigate near field interactions and shielding influence. The method is applied to a structure combining a common mode filter with the <b>floating</b> <b>potentials</b> of an inverter. Using the hybrid method, the near field interactions and the influence of the common mode inductance shielding are analyzed on the <b>floating</b> <b>potentials</b> which are the sensitive part of the structure...|$|R

50|$|A {{ball-pen}} probe is novel {{technique used}} to measure directly the plasma potential in magnetized plasmas. The probe was invented by Jiří Adámek in the Institute of Plasma Physics AS CR in 2004. The ball-pen probe balances the electron saturation current to the same magnitude {{as that of the}} ion saturation current. In this case, its <b>floating</b> <b>potential</b> becomes identical to the plasma potential. This goal is attained by a ceramic shield, which screens off an adjustable part of the electron current from the probe collector due to the much smaller gyro-radius of the electrons. The electron temperature is proportional to the difference of ball-pen probe(plasma potential) and Langmuir probe (<b>floating</b> <b>potential)</b> potential. Thus, the electron temperature can be obtained directly with high temporal resolution without additional power supply.|$|E

50|$|Collisions between ions and {{electrons}} {{will also}} affect the I-V {{characteristic of a}} Langmuir probe. When an electrode is biased to any voltage other than the <b>floating</b> <b>potential,</b> the current it draws must pass through the plasma, which has a finite resistivity. The resistivity and current path can be calculated with relative ease in an unmagnetized plasma. In a magnetized plasma, the problem is much more difficult. In either case, the effect is to add a voltage drop proportional to the current drawn, which shears the characteristic. The deviation from an exponential function is usually not possible to observe directly, so that the flattening of the characteristic is usually misinterpreted as a larger plasma temperature. Looking {{at it from the}} other side, any measured I-V characteristic can be interpreted as a hot plasma, where most of the voltage is dropped in the Debye sheath, or as a cold plasma, where most of the voltage is dropped in the bulk plasma. Without quantitative modeling of the bulk resistivity, Langmuir probes can only give an upper limit on the electron temperature.|$|E

During the 5 hours, 22 minutes spacewalk, He and NASA astronaut William McArthur installed a new camera assembly and jettisoned the <b>Floating</b> <b>Potential</b> Probe. They also completed two get-ahead tasks. Tokarev wore an all-white suit for the spacewalk. Their first primary task was the camera assembly installation on the Port 1 Truss. The two spacewalkers spent about 2 hours, 10 minutes on the installation. In order to have daylight for the <b>Floating</b> <b>Potential</b> Probe (FPP) jettison, they {{moved on to the}} retrieval of a failed remote joint motor controller. Once it was completed, the pair with MacArthur in the lead then moved up the P6 truss to the FPP. The dysfunctional FPP had been designed to measure the space station's electrical potential and compare it to the surrounding plasma. Tokarev and McArthur released and stowed a grounding wire, then released the FPP housing from its stanchion. They checked its condition and McArthur carefully jettisoned the FPP. The FFP removal and jettisoning took an hour to complete. The two spacealkers next removed and replaced a remote power controller module on the mobile transporter. After completing all the tasks the pair returned to the Quest airlock at 3:54 EST. [...] On February 3, 2006, Torakev performed his second career spacewalk. He and McArthur donned in red-striped Orlan suits, ventured outside the ISS at 5:44 p.m. EST from the Pirs docking comapartment airlock to begin the spacewalk. During the spacewalk, Tokarev and McArthur relocated a boom adapter for the Strela, a Russian hand-operated crane, from the Zarya module to Pressurized Mating Adapter 3.

50|$|A second {{benefit of}} {{deposition}} within a discharge {{arises from the}} fact that electrons are more mobile than ions. As a consequence, the plasma is normally more positive than any object it is in contact with, as otherwise a large flux of electrons would flow from the plasma to the object. The difference in voltage between the plasma and the objects in its contacts normally occurs across a thin sheath region. Ionized atoms or molecules that diffuse {{to the edge of the}} sheath region feel an electrostatic force and are accelerated towards the neighboring surface. Thus, all surfaces exposed to the plasma receive energetic ion bombardment. The potential across the sheath surrounding an electrically-isolated object (the <b>floating</b> <b>potential)</b> is typically only 10-20 V, but much higher sheath potentials are achievable by adjustments in reactor geometry and configuration. Thus, films can be exposed to energetic ion bombardment during deposition. This bombardment can lead to increases in density of the film, and help remove contaminants, improving the film's electrical and mechanical properties. When a high-density plasma is used, the ion density can be high enough that significant sputtering of the deposited film occurs; this sputtering can be employed to help planarize the film and fill trenches or holes.|$|E
