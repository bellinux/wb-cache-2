5000|$|A flicker {{light bulb}}, flicker flame light bulb or flicker <b>glow</b> <b>lamp</b> is a gas-discharge lamp which {{produces}} light by ionizing a gas, usually neon mixed with helium {{and a small}} amount of nitrogen gas, by an electric current passing through two flame shaped electrode screens coated with partially decomposed barium azide.

5000|$|A {{neon lamp}} (also neon <b>glow</b> <b>lamp)</b> is a {{miniature}} gas discharge lamp. The lamp typically {{consists of a}} small glass capsule that contains a mixture of neon and other gases at a low pressure and two electrodes (an anode and a cathode). When sufficient voltage is applied and sufficient current is supplied between the electrodes, the lamp produces an orange glow discharge. The glowing portion in the lamp is a thin region near the cathode; the larger and much longer neon signs are also glow discharges, but they use the [...] which is not present in the ordinary neon lamp. Neon glow lamps are widely used as indicator lamps in the displays of electronic instruments and appliances.|$|E
5000|$|Neon {{lighting}} {{consists of}} brightly glowing, electrified glass tubes or bulbs that contain rarefied neon or other gases. Neon lights are {{a type of}} cold cathode gas-discharge light. A neon tube light is a sealed glass tube with a metal electrode at each end, filled with {{one of a number}} of gases at low pressure. A high potential of several thousand volts applied to the electrodes ionizes the gas in the tube, causing it to emit colored light. The color of the light depends on the gas in the tube. Neon lights were named for neon, a noble gas which gives off a popular orange light, but other gases and chemicals are used to produce other colors, such as hydrogen (red), helium (yellow), carbon dioxide (white), and mercury (blue). Neon tubes can be fabricated in curving artistic shapes, to form letters or pictures. They are mainly used to make dramatic, multicolored glowing signage for advertising, called neon signs, which were popular from the 1920s to the 1950s. [...] The term can also refer to the miniature neon <b>glow</b> <b>lamp,</b> developed in 1917, about seven years after neon tube lighting.
