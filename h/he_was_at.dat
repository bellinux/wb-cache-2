5|$|A few teams {{expressed}} interest in St. Louis. He chose to sign with the Tampa Bay Lightning as he believed {{they were the most}} likely to give him playing time in the NHL. He made his debut with the team on October 6, 2000. He struggled at first, failing to score a goal in the first six weeks of the season and again found himself out of the lineup at times. Realizing that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> a career crossroads, St. Louis abandoned the changes to his game that his NHL coaches had impressed on him, trusting his own instincts. He scored his first goal of the season in late November, and finished the season with 18 goals and 40 points – 34 of which came after December 1.|$|E
5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia.

5|$|According to Cassius Dio, {{the conspirators}} {{approached}} Nerva {{as a potential}} successor prior to the assassination, which indicates that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> least aware of the plot. Suetonius by contrast does not mention Nerva, but he may have omitted his role out of tactfulness. Considering the works of Suetonius were published under Nerva's direct descendants Trajan and Hadrian, {{it would have been}} less than sensitive of him to suggest the dynasty owed its accession to murder. On the other hand, Nerva lacked widespread support in the Empire, and as a known Flavian loyalist his track record would not have recommended him to the conspirators. The precise facts have been obscured by history, but modern historians believe Nerva was proclaimed Emperor solely on the initiative of the Senate, within hours after the news of the assassination broke.|$|E

In his only season at the club, he impressed with his technical ability and was subsequently recruited by Championnat National club Libourne Saint-Seurin who had scouted the player eight times while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>at</b> Langon-Castets.|$|E
