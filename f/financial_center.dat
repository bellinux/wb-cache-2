40|$|The {{article is}} aimed at {{determining}} the contemporary trends {{in the development of}} leading financial centres and analyzing the prospects of Asian centers in the context of globalization. A classification of the world <b>financial</b> <b>centers</b> (WFC) is provided. Results of the Global <b>Financial</b> <b>Centers</b> Index in 2017 were analyzed. A comparative analysis of the four major world <b>financial</b> <b>centers</b> (London, New York, Hong Kong, Singapore) was carried out by the major economic ratings. It was assumed that the gap between the classical world <b>financial</b> <b>centers</b> and the new Asian ones would be further narrowed. It has been determined that the growing influence of Asian <b>financial</b> <b>centers</b> is linked to positive trends in economic growth, favorable fiscal policies, and dynamic investment activities.

5|$|The world {{experienced}} {{substantial changes}} prior to 1914, which created an environment favorable {{to an increase}} in and development of international financial centers. Principal among such changes were unprecedented growth in capital flows and the resulting rapid <b>financial</b> <b>center</b> integration, as well as faster communication. Before 1870, London and Paris existed as the world's only prominent financial centers. Soon after, Berlin and New York grew to become major financial centres. An array of smaller financial centers became important as they found market niches, such as Amsterdam, Brussels, Zurich, and Geneva. London remained the leading international <b>financial</b> <b>center</b> in the four decades leading up to World War I.|$|E

Furthermore, managers in <b>financial</b> <b>centers</b> increase trading after good performance. This result is particularly strong for inexperienced, more educated male fund managers investing in growth stocks and located in New York.

The North Tower, South Tower, the Marriott Hotel (3WTC), and 7WTC were completely destroyed. The U.S. Customs House (6 World Trade Center), 4 World Trade Center, 5 World Trade Center, and both pedestrian bridges connecting buildings were severely damaged. The Deutsche Bank Building on 130 Liberty Street was partially damaged and demolished some years later, starting in 2007.

5|$|Dallas and Fort Worth {{experienced}} one {{of their}} greatest oil-related construction booms in 1930 and 1931, when {{the opening of the}} East Texas oil field helped establish Dallas as the <b>financial</b> <b>center</b> for the oil industry in Texas and Oklahoma. New business offices and municipal buildings appeared in the city, including the Highland Park Village shopping center, one of the nation's earliest shopping malls. The Depression slowed population growth in the Dallas area somewhat during the later 1930s, but rapid growth patterns returned again during the 1940s. By this time, though, Dallas had already begun to rediversify, becoming a center for aircraft manufacturing and electronics technology in addition to a variety of other industries.|$|E

40|$|The rapid {{progress}} {{of globalization and}} information technology has stimulated profound changes in the global financial landscape and attracted growing interest in the geography of finance. Although there is apparently remarkable stability in the ordering of <b>financial</b> <b>centers</b> over time, the spatial changes of regional, national, and even global <b>financial</b> <b>centers</b> are an ongo-ing process.

5|$|Shanghai's first {{building}} boom {{occurred in the}} 1920s and 1930s, during the city's heyday as a multinational center of business and finance. The city's international concessions permitted foreign investment, and with it came architectural styles from the West, as seen today {{in areas such as}} the French Concession and the Bund. After the Communist takeover in 1949 the city's development was stifled, punished for its earlier capitalist excesses. After economic reforms beginning in the 1980s, the city is undergoing its second construction boom to fulfill its desire to regain its status as an important global <b>financial</b> <b>center.</b>|$|E

The statue was displayed on a float, which traveled along Fifth Avenue north from 23rd Street to 56th Street. It was dedicated that same day, in a ceremony led by Vice President Joe Biden and Lieutenant-General John Mulholland, commander of U.S. Army Special Operations Command and formerly commander of Task Force Dagger during the initial days of the War in Afghanistan.

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, the federal and state governments left Philadelphia, but the city continued for some years to be the country's cultural and <b>financial</b> <b>center.</b> Its large free black community aided fugitive slaves and founded the first independent black denomination in the nation, the African Methodist Episcopal Church. Philadelphia {{became one of the first}} U.S. industrial centers with a variety of industries, the largest being textiles. It had many economic and family ties to the South, with southern planters maintaining second homes in the city and having business connections with banks, sending their daughters to French finishing schools run by refugees from Saint-Domingue (Haiti), selling their cotton to textile manufacturers, which in turn sold some products to the South, for instance, clothing for slaves. At {{the beginning}} of the American Civil War, there were many southern sympathizers, although most city residents became firmly Union as the war went on.|$|E
5|$|Istanbul {{is home to}} Borsa Istanbul, {{the sole}} {{exchange}} entity of Turkey, which combined the former Istanbul Stock Exchange, the Istanbul Gold Exchange, and the Derivatives Exchange of Turkey. The former Istanbul Stock Exchange was originally established as the Ottoman Stock Exchange in 1866. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, Bankalar Caddesi (Banks Street) in Galata was the <b>financial</b> <b>center</b> of the Ottoman Empire, where the Ottoman Stock Exchange was located. Bankalar Caddesi continued to be Istanbul's main financial district until the 1990s, when most Turkish banks began moving their headquarters to the modern central business districts of Levent and Maslak. In 1995, the Istanbul Stock Exchange (now Borsa Istanbul) moved to its current building in the İstinye quarter of the Sarıyer district. A new central business district is also under construction in Ataşehir and will host the headquarters of various Turkish banks and financial institutions upon completion.|$|E

5|$|The Arabian Peninsula {{was largely}} arid and volcanic, making {{agriculture}} difficult except near oases or springs. The landscape was dotted with towns and cities; {{two of the}} most prominent being Mecca and Medina. Medina was a large flourishing agricultural settlement, while Mecca was an important <b>financial</b> <b>center</b> for many surrounding tribes. Communal life was essential for survival in the desert conditions, supporting indigenous tribes against the harsh environment and lifestyle. Tribal affiliation, whether based on kinship or alliances, was an important source of social cohesion. Indigenous Arabs were either nomadic or sedentary, the former constantly travelling {{from one place to another}} seeking water and pasture for their flocks, while the latter settled and focused on trade and agriculture. Nomadic survival also depended on raiding caravans or oases; nomads did not view this as a crime.|$|E
5|$|As {{one of the}} world's leading {{international}} financial centres, Hong Kong has a major capitalist service economy characterised by low taxation and free trade. From {{the second half of}} the 19th century and continuing into the first half of the 20th century, Hong Kong operated as a key command centre for the allocation of Asian capital in its broadest form. Hong Kong stature as an International Financial centre (IFC), gradually developed from the 1950s to become a key component of the island's economy. It is an important centre for international finance and trade, with one of the greatest concentrations of corporate headquarters in the Asia-Pacific region. The Hong Kong Stock Exchange is the seventh largest in the world and has a market capitalisation of US$3.2 trillion as of December 2016. In 2009, Hong Kong raised 22 percent of worldwide initial public offering (IPO) capital, making it the largest centre of IPOs in the world and the easiest place to raise capital. In the 2017 Global Financial Centres Index, Hong Kong was ranked as having the fourth most competitive <b>financial</b> <b>center</b> in the world (alongside cities such as London, New York City, Tokyo, San Francisco, Chicago, Sydney, Boston, and Toronto in the top 10), and second most competitive in Asia after Singapore.|$|E
