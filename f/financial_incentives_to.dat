5|$|Following his defeat, Patton {{returned}} to Pike County. In 1989 he was re-elected {{for a third}} term as judge/executive, receiving over 70percent {{of the vote in}} a three-way Democratic primary and subsequently winning the general election by nearly a three-to-one margin. He immediately began preparing for another run for lieutenant governor in 1991. In the earlier campaign, the UMWA had been vociferously opposed to Patton because employees in his coal mines had been affiliated with the Southern Labor Union. Skipper Martin introduced him to Teamsters leaders, and Patton worked with them to unionize Pike County employees. He also worked with Kelsey Friend to pass the Kentucky Rural Economic Development Act, a measure giving <b>financial</b> <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> companies that located in economically depressed rural counties.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1891, the Society for the {{improvement}} of New Forest Ponies organised a stallion show and offered <b>financial</b> <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> encourage owners of good stallions to run them on the Forest. In 1905 the Burley and District NF Pony Breeding and Cattle Society was set up to start the stud book and organise the Breed Show; the two societies merged in 1937 to form the New Forest Pony Breeding and Cattle Society. Overall numbers of livestock grazing the Forest, including ponies, tended to decline in the early twentieth century; in 1945 there were just 571 ponies depastured. By 1956 the number of ponies of all breeds on the Forest had more than doubled to 1,341. Twenty years later pony numbers were up to 3,589, rising to 4,112 in 1994, before dipping back below four thousand until 2005. As of 2011, there were 4,604 ponies grazing on the New Forest.|$|E

In 1973 he converted Gabonese President Omar Bongo, an action which he repeated {{three years later}} with Jean-Bédel Bokassa, president of the Central African Republic. Between 1973 and 1979, Libya provided $500 million in aid to African countries, namely to Zaire and Uganda, and founded joint-venture companies throughout the country to aid trade and development. Gaddafi was also keen on reducing Israeli influence within Africa, using <b>financial</b> <b>incentives</b> <b>to</b> successfully convince eight African states to break off diplomatic relations with Israel in 1973. A strong relationship was also established between Gaddafi's Libya and Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's Pakistani government, with the two countries exchanging nuclear research and military assistance; this relationship ended after Bhutto was deposed by Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq in 1977.|$|E

40|$|Shareholder {{litigation}} {{is important because}} it is costly and can influence firms' reporting behavior. Prior research finds that attorneys' incentives and specific firm characteristics drive shareholder litigation. In this study, I control for these known drivers in order to examine whether an additional behavioral factor, investor retribution, also drives shareholder litigation. Retribution theory suggests that investors will initiate litigation to punish managers for misreporting even when there is no <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> do so. My study uses experimental markets to examine whether retribution plays a role in investors' litigation decisions, and if this, in turn, affects managers' reporting decisions. Consistent with economic theory, I find that when investors do not have an option to initiate litigation, managers frequently misreport and investors do not find their reports credible. Further, when investors have an option to initiate litigation and a <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> do so (similar to current securities laws), misreporting decreases and the credibility of managers' reports increases. However, inconsistent with economic theory but consistent with retribution theory, when investors have an option to initiate litigation but have no <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> do so, misreporting decreases and the credibility of managers' reports increases to approximately the same level as when investors have a <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> initiate litigation. These findings have important implications for regulators and managers who need to accurately anticipate investors' litigation decisions in order to make optimal policy and reporting decisions...|$|R
50|$|Sometimes {{moral hazard}} is so severe it makes {{insurance}} policies impossible.

40|$|Whereas firms {{traditionally}} {{have been evaluated}} solely on financial criteria, contemporary firms are also evaluated on various non-financial criteria, including Corporate Social Performance (CSP).

Evidence on such relationships is valuable from many perspectives. It is valuable to managers who seek to improve their understanding {{of the ways in which}} CSP interacts with firm characteristics, it is valuable to investors who seek to improve their understanding of how CSP relates to financial asset characteristics, and ultimately it is valuable to regulators who seek to improve their understanding of the firms <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> self-regulate on corporate social responsibility issues. This paper presents a cross-sectional analysis comparing environmental, social and corporate governance performance with financial characteristics of 237 Australian firms over the August 1997 to July 2003 period. The analysis allows for some heterogeneity in CSP-financial characteristics relationships related to company size, trading history and industry, which provides valuable additional information on such relationships. Findings indicate that the <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> self-regulate on environmental criteria is weak and contingent on industry. The <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> self-regulate on social criteria is marginally stronger and less contingent on industry. The <b>financial</b> <b>incentive</b> <b>to</b> self-regulate on governance criteria is very strong across the board, though it is particularly strong within the banking, diversified financials, insurance and telecommunications industries. This is indicated both by a significant positive association between governance and financial performance and very strong significant negative association between governance and risk.
