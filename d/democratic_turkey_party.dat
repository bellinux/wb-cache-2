40|$|The {{commitment}} to the procedural rules of democracy, particularly to the electoral mechanism, {{on the part of}} political leadership is considered necessary for the establishment and survival of democracy. However, the political actors' {{commitment to}} the electoral mechanism does not guarantee the well-being of the democratic regime. In newly established democracies, the electoral mechanism itself can also function as a disadvantage to democracy if it is manipulated by the political elite. Based on this assumption, this article analyzes the case of <b>Turkey's</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (DP, Demokrat Parti) under the leadership of Celal Bayar and Adnan Menderes between 1946 and 60 and demonstrates that political actors can exploit the electoral mechanism by either rescheduling elections or amending the electoral regulations despite their acceptance of it as one of the basic procedural rules of democracy. © 2011 Taylor & Francis...|$|R

Until then it had held this majority without interruption for 13 years since it had come to power in 2002. Also, in this election, the AK Party was pushing to gain 330 seats in the Grand National Assembly so that it could put a series of constitutional changes to a referendum, one of them was to switch Turkey from the current parliamentary government to an American-style executive presidency government. This pursuit met with a series of oppositions and criticism from the opposition parties and their supporters, fearing the measure would give more unchecked power to the current President of Turkey Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, who has been drawing fierce criticisms both from home and abroad for his active role in the election, abandoning the traditional presidential role of maintaining a more neutral and impartial position in elections by his predecessors in the office. The result of the Kurdish issues-centred Peoples' <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> (<b>Turkey),</b> HDP, breaking through the 10% threshold to achieve 13.12% out of the total votes cast and gaining 80 seats in the Grand National Assembly in this election successfully derailed the AK Party from maintaining its hold of power as the majority party and a single-party government as well as enacting a referendum necessary to change the constitution.
