However, due to equipment constraints, the aim was changed to developing an understanding of the settling characteristics of the mud.

It is shown here, however, that a Debye-like screening of a particle’s velocity disturbance, leading to a finite variance, will occur if the pair probability reflects a net deficit of one particle in the vicinity of each particle. The three-particle interactions, which determine the structure of a dilute, monodisperse suspension of spheres, lead to a deficit of neighbouring particles. The magnitude and range of this deficit are shown to be sufficient to lead to a Debye-like screening of the velocity disturbance a t a radial distance of order a 4 -l, where a is the particle radius and 4 their volume fraction. A self-consistent approximation to the screened conditional average velocity field and pair distribution is presented.

Two setups were investigated: one without liquid filling the reactor and one with filling the reactor with an inert liquid medium (BP Energol CS-HB 220). The liquid level of the reactor was (according to the experiments for the catalytic HDO of CVO) two-thirds at the reaction temperature relative to the overall reactor volume.

40|$|Coagulation is the {{formation}} of large particles ‘from multiple collisions of smaller ones. Because larger particles fall faster than smaller ones, coagulation can be important in accelerating the export of organic matter from the ocean’s surface to the deep sea and {{has the potential to}} limit phyto-plankton populations. We have developed a model of an algal bloom that includes nutrient and light limitation of algal growth rate and coagulation of single algal cells. The results show two effects of coagulation on the growth model. Loss of dividing cells to coagulating particles can occur when algal cells are growing at a fairly constant rate, placing a cap on the concentrations that algae can achieve. The second effect is enhancement of vertical particle flux from the surface mixed layer in aggregates. This enhanced transport moves algal biomass from the surface mixed layer over shorter periods at rates far greater than those associated with settling of single cells. For example, half the material associated with a bloom of 2 -pm-radius algae, which would take 350 <b>d</b> to <b>settle</b> out as isolated cells, took 42 d as aggregates.
