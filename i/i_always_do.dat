2500|$|In a small {{business}} all these functions might be done by one person or shared between the participants. In larger enterprises roles can differentiate and become more specialized emphasizing one or more aspects of the VSM. Local conditions, the environment {{and nature of the}} service or product, determines where warehousing, sales, advertising, promotion, dispatch, taxation, finance, salaries etc., fit into this picture. Not all enterprises charge for their transactions (e.g. some schools and medical services, policing) and voluntary staff may not be paid. Advertising or shipping might not be part of the business or they might be the principal activity. Whatever the circumstances, all enterprises are required to be useful to their users if they are to remain viable. For all participants the central question remains: [...] "Do I do what <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> for this transaction or do I innovate?" [...] It is embodied in the calls on System 4. The VSM describes the constraints: a knowledge of past performance and how it may be improved.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Imogene huskily, {{and she let}} an {{interval}} that was long to them both elapse before she said anything more. [...] "Have <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>done</b> what you thought best, Mrs. Bowen?" ...|$|R
60|$|THE STATUE. I was {{expected}} to, Juan. That is {{how things were}} arranged on earth. I was not a social reformer; and <b>I</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> what it was customary for a gentleman to do.|$|R
