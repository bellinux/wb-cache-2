6000|$|If, however, your {{children}} are not average children, if you are so happy as to have begotten children of exceptional intelligence, {{it does not follow}} that this fact will save them from conclusions quite parallel to those of the common child. Suppose they do penetrate the pretence that there is no intrinsic difference between the Royal Family {{and the members of the}} peerage on the one hand, and the average person in any other class on the other; suppose they discover that the whole scale of precedence and honour in their land is a stupendous sham;-- what then? Suppose they see quite clearly that all these pretensions of an inviolate superiority of birth and breeding vanish at the touch of a Whitaker Wright, soften to a glowing cordiality before the sunny promises of a Hooley. Suppose they perceive that neither King nor lords really believe in their own lordliness, and that at any point in the system one may find men with hands for any man's tip, provided it is only sufficiently large! Even then!--How <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>going</b> to react upon our children's social conduct? ...|$|E
60|$|It will {{be obvious}} that the {{interest}} of this speculation, at any rate, centres upon this great intermediate mass {{of people who are}} neither passively wealthy, the sleeping partners of change, nor helplessly thrust out of the process. Indeed, from our point of view--an inquiry into coming things--these non-effective masses would have but the slightest interest were it not for their enormous possibilities of reaction upon the really living portion of the social organism. This really living portion seems at first sight to be as deliquescent in its nature, to be drifting down to as chaotic a structure as either the non-functional owners that float above it or the unemployed who sink below. What were once the definite subdivisions of the middle class modify and lose their boundaries. The retail tradesman of the towns, for example--once a fairly homogeneous class throughout Europe--expands here into vast store companies, and dwindles there to be an agent or collector, seeks employment or topples outright into the abyss. But under a certain scrutiny one can detect here what we do not detect in our other two elements, and that <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>going</b> on {{side by side with the}} processes of dissolution and frequently masked by these, there are other processes by which men, often of the most diverse parentage and antecedent traditions, are being segregated into a multitude of specific new groups which may presently develop very distinctive characters and ideals.|$|E

He's in some bum shack, pressing pants all day, or stooped over sewing, and having to be polite to any grouch that blows in and jams a dirty stinking old suit in his face and says, 'Here you, fix this, and be blame quick about it.' He won't even have enough savvy to get him a big shop. He'll pike along doing his own work--unless you, his wife, go help him, go help him in the shop, and stand over a table all day, pushing a big heavy iron. Your complexion will look fine after about fifteen years of baking that way, won't it! And you'll be humped over like an old hag. And probably you'll live in one room back of the shop. And then at night--oh, you'll have your artist--sure! He'll come in stinking of gasoline, and cranky from hard work, and hinting around that if it hadn't been for you, he'd of gone East and been a great artist. Sure! And you'll be entertaining his relatives----Talk about Uncle Whit! You'll be having some old Axel Axelberg coming in with manure on his boots and sitting down to supper in his socks and yelling at you, 'Hurry up now, you vimmin make me sick!' Yes, and you'll have a squalling brat every year, tugging at you while you press clothes, and you won't love 'em like you do Hugh up-stairs, all downy and asleep----" ...|$|E

The central icon of the linga in the sanctum is not the original but a duplicate, as the original is untraced. Worship is offered at the temple by the local people. A unique feature of the depictions on the linga is that it has 999 more lingas carved all around its surface.

5000|$|The parade {{took place}} in August 2016, and TIE were joined by various cross-party {{politicians}} including Mhairi Black, Alyn Smith, Angela Crawley, Patrick Harvie, Martin Docherty and Clare Haughey in calling for urgent action from the Scottish Government with regards to LGBT inclusivity within education. In a well received speech ahead of the parade, TIE co founder Liam Stevenson restated the campaign's aim of ensuring that LGBT issues were taught in all schools {{in an effort to}} tackle homophobic bullying, concluding that “...there are young people with laceration marks on their arms and young people who have committed suicide due to being bullied.

50|$|In 2010 Polidoro {{was asked}} to write the biography, and {{during the past year}} he spent time looking through the {{material}} gathered by Jillette and Scheinberg, along with the material used for the film “An Honest Liar”. The documentary, directed by Justin Weinstein and Tyler Measom, tells the story of Randi’s life. In an interview Polidoro stated, “ One of the most interesting things <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>going</b> through the research about Randi's life, his stories, when he tells them, that's quite something because many times you see they are different, but the original ones, they're even more interesting, more surprising! And that's how memory works.” The biography will be co-authored by Scheinberg with an introduction by Jillette. The current goal is to find a publisher {{by the end of the}} year. Another possibility that is being considered is to launch a fund raising campaign through a crowd-funding website.|$|E

5000|$|In {{a number}} of Canadian cities, high schools are called [...] "collegiate institutes" [...] (C.I.), a {{complicated}} form of the word [...] "college" [...] which avoids the usual [...] "post-secondary" [...] connotation. The term [...] "collegiate institute" [...] first appeared in Ontario after the 1900s {{in the name of}} high schools because at the higher grades it was one of very few forms of education besides a [...] "formal" [...] university. Another reason <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>going</b> back in history secondary schools have traditionally focused on academic, rather than vocational subjects and ability levels, for example, collegiates offered Latin while vocational schools offered technical courses. In Ontario at one time schools that focused on vocational educational were [...] "officially" [...] called High school/ secondary school and went up to grade 12, while schools that went up to grade 13, and prepared students for University were called [...] "Collegiate Institute" ...|$|E
5000|$|In May 2014, Tim decided his {{relationship}} with Sally should {{come to an end}} and dumped her. Discussing Tim's reason behind his actions, Duttine said: [...] "She was getting a bit judgmental about Tim’s opinion of Maddie, and she wasn’t very sympathetic about Maddie’s situation with Ben. Plus, she was being a bit snobby about his window cleaning job. She lost her sense of humour, and I think when Tim tried to lighten the mood, it didn’t go down very well. He just thought she was being too much of a nightmare and bailed out. For Tim, it’s all about having an easy life and not wanting too much conflict or confrontation." [...] They quickly reunited and when Sally spots Tim in a jewellers, she jumps to the conclusion he is going to propose. This makes Tim consider proposing to Sally. Talking to Lynn Connolly of Unreality TV, Duttine said: [...] "He goes in there to buy Faye a watch, but then Sally jumps to the conclusion that he’s going to propose to her. He then goes to buy a ring with the intention of proposing to Sally because he feels it’s what she wants, not because he wants it. So I guess he does love her, and he’s putting her first and trying to please her." [...] Duttine continued to say how after Tim proposes, they discuss their relationship and realise neither of them want to get married, before revealing he [...] "un-proposes" [...] to Sally in the Rovers Return Inn. Duttine said he thought this was [...] "sweet". Duttine also went on to say how he felt Tim and Sally were a [...] "good, fun couple". In May 2015, Duttine and Dynevor discussed Tim and Sally's relationship with Phillip Schofield and Amanda Holden on ITV daytime programme, This Morning, with Dynevor saying how she initially thought Tim and Sally would not go well as a couple: [...] "I was like, 'Tim Metcalfe and Sally Webster - how <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>going</b> to work?' but as soon as they put us together and we got the script and starting working together we found things hilariously funny." [...] Duttine commented that Tim is [...] "just pleased to be here and glad somebody will have him." [...] and Dynevor agreed, saying that Sally [...] "feels the same - she’s just glad she has a boyfriend!" ...|$|E

40|$|Phenomena {{that take}} place at a global level, beyond any control of {{national}} governments are subject of great controversies. Even {{if there is a}} little knowledge about how to control these processes, scientists are interested in assessing effects of globalization. Because {{a large part of the}} arguments that are opposing globalization come from environmental effects, we have considered necessary to make some clarification in this field. The main economic effect of globalization is an increase in trade. Because this represents one of the premises for economic growth, general acceptance <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>going</b> global means going richer. But there is an other side of the coin – environment. If environmental effects are to be considered, calculation results could point out some unexpected, and unwanted, long-term effects.
