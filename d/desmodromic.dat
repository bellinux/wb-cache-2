2500|$|As planned, the World Championship races {{returned}} to Formula One regulations for the 1954 season, now {{based on a}} new 2.5-litre atmospheric engine regulation. This successfully brought more entrants to the field. Lancia and Mercedes-Benz came to the formula, hiring the best drivers of the era: Ascari for Lancia, Fangio for Mercedes. Featuring <b>desmodromic</b> valves, fuel injection, magnesium and exotic alloys parts, [...] "streamlined" [...] bodywork and other advanced features, the brand new Mercedes began the 1954 season with Fangio taking pole position at the [...] "Grand Prix de l'ACF" [...] at Reims-Gueux with the first lap over [...] in Formula One before winning the race after a duel with other Mercedes driver Karl Kling, who finished second.|$|E
2500|$|This period {{featured}} teams {{managed by}} road car manufacturers Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz, and Maserati; {{all of whom}} had competed before the war. The first seasons were run using pre-war cars like Alfa's 158. They were front-engined, with narrow tyres and 1.5-litre supercharged or 4.5-litre normally aspirated engines. The [...] and [...] World Championships were run to Formula Two regulations, for smaller, less powerful cars, due to concerns over the paucity of Formula One cars available. When a new Formula One, for engines limited to 2.5litres, was reinstated to the world championship for 1954, Mercedes-Benz introduced the advanced W196, which featured innovations such as <b>desmodromic</b> valves and fuel injection as well as enclosed streamlined bodywork. Mercedes drivers won the championship for two years, before the team withdrew from all motorsport {{in the wake of the}} 1955 Le Mans disaster.|$|E
2500|$|In the 1960s, Ducati earned {{its place}} in motorcycling history by {{producing}} the fastest 250cc road bike then available, the Mach 1. In the 1970s Ducati began producing large-displacement V-twin [...] motorcycles and in 1973, released a V-twin with the trademarked <b>desmodromic</b> valve design. In 1985, Cagiva bought Ducati and planned to rebadge Ducati motorcycles with the [...] "Cagiva" [...] name. By the time the purchase was completed, Cagiva kept the [...] "Ducati" [...] name on its motorcycles. Eleven years later, in 1996, Cagiva accepted the offer from Texas Pacific Group and sold a 51% {{stake in the company}} for US$325 million; then, in 1998, Texas Pacific Group bought most of the remaining 49% to become the sole owner of Ducati. In 1999, TPG issued an initial public offering of Ducati stock and renamed the company [...] "Ducati Motor Holding SpA". TPG sold over 65% of its shares in Ducati, leaving TPG the majority shareholder. In December 2005, Ducati returned to Italian ownership with the sale of Texas Pacific's stake (minus one share) to Investindustrial Holdings, the investment fund of Carlo and Andrea Bonomi.|$|E

5000|$|Fully {{controlled}} valve movement was conceived during {{the earliest days}} of engine development, but devising a system that worked reliably and was not overly complex took a long time. <b>Desmodromic</b> valve systems are first mentioned in patents in 1896 by Gustav Mees. Austin's marine engine of 1910 produced 300 bhp and was installed in a speedboat called [...] "Irene I"; its all-aluminium, twin-overhead-valve engine had twin magnetos, twin carburetors and <b>desmodromic</b> valves. The 1914 Grand Prix Delage and Nagant (see Pomeroy [...] "Grand Prix Car") used a <b>desmodromic</b> valve system (quite unlike the present day Ducati system).|$|E

50|$|The {{common valve}} spring system is {{satisfactory}} for traditional mass-produced engines {{that do not}} rev highly and are of a design that requires low maintenance. At the period of initial <b>desmodromic</b> development, valve springs were a major limitation on engine performance because they would break from metal fatigue. Vacuum melt processes developed in the 1950s helped remove impurities in the steel used to make valve springs, although after sustained operation above 8000 RPM often springs would still fail. The <b>desmodromic</b> system was devised to remedy this problem. Furthermore, as maximum RPM increases, higher spring force is required to prevent valve float, leading to increased cam drag and higher wear on the parts at all speeds, problems addressed by the <b>desmodromic</b> mechanism.|$|E
50|$|In January, 1968, Ducati {{announced}} plans to build and market the 450 cc Mark 3D. The D was for <b>Desmodromic.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1959, the Maserati {{brothers}} introduced one {{of their}} final designs: a <b>desmodromic</b> four-cylinder, 2000cc engine for their last O.S.C.A. Barchetta.|$|E
50|$|In 1956, Fabio Taglioni, a Ducati engineer, {{developed}} a <b>desmodromic</b> valve {{system for the}} Ducati 125 Grand Prix, creating the Ducati 125 Desmo.|$|E
50|$|The Mercedes-Benz W196 Formula One {{racing car}} of 1954-1955, and the Mercedes-Benz 300SLR sports racing car of 1955 both had <b>desmodromic</b> valve actuation.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the days}} when valve drive {{dynamics}} could be analyzed by computer, <b>desmodromic</b> drive seemed to offer solutions for problems that were worsening with increasing engine speed. Since those days, lift, velocity, acceleration, and jerk curves for cams have been modelled by computer to reveal that cam dynamics are not what they seemed. With proper analysis, problems relating to valve adjustment, hydraulic tappets, push rods, rocker arms, and above all, valve float, became things of the past without <b>desmodromic</b> drive.|$|E

50|$|A <b>desmodromic</b> valve is a {{reciprocating}} engine valve that is positively closed by a cam and leverage system, {{rather than by}} a more conventional spring.|$|E
50|$|The Ducati 888 was a {{motorcycle}} manufactured by Ducati as an upgrade to the Ducati 851. The earlier 851 had introduced liquid cooling, computerized fuel injection and four-valve {{heads to the}} company's two cylinder motors. In 1991 Ducati increased {{the capacity of the}} 851 to 888 cc to create the 888. Both engines featured the Desmoquattro valvetrain concept in which a four valve per cylinder motor was given <b>desmodromic</b> valve actuation, with cams both opening and closing the valves. Ducati's <b>desmodromic</b> system reduces the frictional penalty from conventional valve springs.|$|E
50|$|In contrast, <b>desmodromic</b> drive uses two cams per valve, {{each with}} {{separate}} rocker arm (lever tappets). Maximum valve acceleration being limited by cam-to-tappet galling stress, {{is governed by}} moving mass and cam contact area. Rigidity and contact stress are best achieved with conventional flat tappets and springs whose lift and closure stress is unaffected by spring force, both occurring at the base circlewhere spring load is minimum and contact radius is largest.Curved (lever) tappetsof <b>desmodromic</b> cams cause higher contact stress than flat tappets for the same lift profile, thereby limiting rate of lift and closure.|$|E
50|$|In modern engines, {{valve spring}} failure at high RPM has been mostly remedied. The main {{benefit of the}} <b>desmodromic</b> system is the {{prevention}} of valve float at high rpm.|$|E
50|$|It {{performs}} {{similarly to}} BMW's Valvetronic system but with <b>desmodromic</b> {{control of the}} output cam, allowing VVEL to operate at higher engine speeds (RPM). Other similar systems are offered Toyota (Valvematic).|$|E
50|$|Firsts {{included}} {{the use of}} <b>desmodromic</b> valves and Daimler-Benz developed mechanical direct fuel injection adapted from the DB 601 high-performance V12 used on the Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighter during World War II.|$|E
50|$|As {{with its}} {{predecessor}} the GP8 contains a four-cylinder 800cc engine with <b>desmodromic</b> actuation of its 16 valves. The engine has improved mid-range response and top-end power {{compared to that}} of the GP7.|$|E
50|$|Azzariti, a short lived Italian {{manufacturer}} from 1933 to 1934, produced 173 cc and 348 cc twin-cylinder engines, some {{of which}} had <b>desmodromic</b> valve gear, with the valve being closed by a separate camshaft.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>desmodromic</b> system avoids this problem, {{because it}} does not have to {{overcome}} the static energy of the spring. It must work against the momentum of the valve opening and closing, and that force still depends on the effective mass of the moving parts. The effective mass of a traditional valve with spring includes one-half of the valve spring mass and all of the valve spring retainer mass. However, a <b>desmodromic</b> system must deal with the inertia of the two rocker arms per valve, so this advantage depends greatly on the skill of the designer. Another disadvantage is the contact point between the cams and rocker arms. It is relatively easy to use roller tappets in conventional valvetrains, although it does add considerable moving mass. In a <b>desmodromic</b> system the roller would be needed {{at one end of the}} rocker arm, which would greatly increase its moment-of-inertia and negate its [...] "effective mass" [...] advantage. Thus, desmo systems have generally needed to deal with sliding friction between the cam and rocker arm and therefore may have greater wear. The contact points on most Ducati rocker arms are hard-chromed to reduce this wear. Another possible disadvantage is that it would be very difficult to incorporate hydraulic valve lash adjusters in a <b>desmodromic</b> system, so the valves must be periodically adjusted, but this is true of typical performance oriented motorcycles as valve lash is typically set using a shim under a cam follower.|$|E
50|$|In 1963 the {{brothers}} sold {{the company to}} Count Domenico Agusta, owner of MV Agusta, They did design work for Agusta until 1966. One of their final designs was a <b>desmodromic</b> four-cylinder engine. O.S.C.A. ended operations in 1967.|$|E
50|$|In 1967, {{after eight}} years of development, Ducati {{introduced}} its first production <b>Desmodromic</b> engine, a machine that drew as much from the race track as it did from the drawing board, epitomising the engineering concept that “form follows function”.|$|E
50|$|Some Capriolo engines {{featured}} the Küchen <b>desmodromic</b> valve system, and others used face-cams http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/199885/face-cam {{rather than the}} usual camshaft valve operation. Another Capriolo used a longitudinal flat twin, a layout not usually seen except on BMWs or BMW derivatives.|$|E
