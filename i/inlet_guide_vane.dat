40|$|The {{ability of}} a part-span {{variable}} <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> to modulate the thrust of a high bypass turbofan engine was evaluated at altitude/Mach number conditions of 4572 m/ 0. 6 and 9144 m/ 0. 93. Fan-tip, gas generator and supercharger performance were also determined, both on operating lines and during fan duct throttling. The evaluation was repeated with the bypass splitter extended forward to near the fan blade trailing edge. Gross thrust attenuation of over 50 % was achieved with 50 deg variable <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> closure at 100 % corrected fan speed. Gas generator supercharger performance fell off with variable <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> closure but this loss was reduced when a splitter extension was added. The effect of variable <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> closure on gas generator performance was minimal...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of Inlet Guide Valve is optimized with designing new efficient mechanism for their actuation. Inlet Guide Valve is an umbrella term which comprises both inlet Guide Vanes and the mechanism to actuate them. Guide vanes not only provide the inlet pressure drop but also impart a whirl motion {{to the gas}} as it enters the compressor impeller. Since this whirl motion is in the rotational direction of the impeller, it reduces {{the amount of work}} the impeller is required to do on the gas. This paper contains the basic concept behind <b>Inlet</b> <b>Guide</b> <b>Vane,</b> their working & importance. Also included is the new designed mechanism. The results of various positions of <b>Inlet</b> <b>Guide</b> <b>Vane</b> on Upstream Fluid Flow are analyzed & include in this paper. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} determine the electric power requirements necessary for ice protection of <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> by continuous heating and by cyclical de-icing. Data are presented to show the effect of ambient-air temperature, liquid-water content, air velocity, heat-on period, and cycle times on the power requirements for these two methods of ice protection. The results showed that for a hypothetical engine using 28 <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> under similar icing conditions, cyclical de-icing can provide a total power saving as high as 79 percent over that required for continuous heating. Heat-on periods {{in the order of}} 10 seconds with a cycle ratio of about 1 : 7 resulted in the best over-all performance with respect to total power requirements and aerodynamic losses during the heat-off period. Power requirements reported herein may be reduced by as much as 25 percent by achieving a more uniform surface-temperature distribution. A parameter in terms of engine mass flow, vane size, vane surface temperature, and the icing conditions ahead of the <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes.</b> was developed by which an extension of the experimental data to icing conditions and <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes,</b> other than those investigated was possible...|$|R

40|$|In a VAV (variable air volume) system, the {{set point}} of the static {{pressure}} (usually measured at 213 downstream of the main supply air duct) is maintained by modulating the fan speed or <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> position. The set {{point of the}} static pressure is often set at a constant value, which is adequate to provide design flow to each room. This method consumes more fan power than necessary under partial load conditions. The fan speed or <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> can also be controlled based on the maximum damper position of the terminal boxes. This method is called air volume control logic. Under this control logic, terminal box airflow requirements are met with reduced static pressure. Fan power consumption is minimized. However, the actual system performance also depends on other factors, such as inaccurate temperature or flow sensors, faulty control valves, unbalanced loads, etc. This paper discusses the existing air volume control logic, its reliability and an improved air volume control logic...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{an analysis of}} moveable <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> operation for use in active control of rotating stall in axial flow compressors. The results indicate that blade deflections needed (in degrees) are approximately {{one half of the}} sensed axial velocity disturbance (in percent). Models were developed for the blade row, the control perturbations launched by the moving blades, and the compressor. These models were used in a parametric study which showed that from a control wave launching point of view, airfoil camber and mean flow turning of the cascade are unimportant, whereas fraction of blades moved and solidity are the key parameters. Furthermore, the compressor model lead to the result that the more in phase the blade misstaggering is with the velocity disturbance, the more effective the control is. These results were then used to design and build an <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> row of 12 blades for testing as a stall control device...|$|E
40|$|The overall {{performance}} of a fan stage with nine <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle settings is presented. These data were obtained over the stable flow range at speeds from 60 to 120 percent of design for vane setting angles from - 25 to 42. 5 degrees. At design speed and design <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> angle, the stage has a peak efficiency of 0. 892 at a pressure ratio of 1. 322 and a flow of 25. 31 kg/s. The stall margin based on peak efficiency and stall was 20 percent. Based on an operating line passing through the peak efficiency point at the design setting angle, the useful operating range of the stage at design speed is limited by stall at the positive setting angles and by choke at the negative angles. At design the calculated static thrust along the operating line varied from 68 to 114 percent of that obtained at design setting angle...|$|E

40|$|The {{cavitation}} {{performance of}} an {{axial flow pump}} with <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> for different flow rates is studied in this article. The effects of <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> on pump hydraulic performance and cavitation are investigated, where the total vapor fraction of impeller zone (Ftv) is calculated to predict the critical net positive suction head, which is compared with that predicted by efficiency criterion for different flow rates. The influences {{of the development of}} cavitation on internal flow in impeller zone are also investigated. The results obtained show that the cavitation performance of axial flow pump can be improved at off-design flow conditions by adjusting angles of <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> to positive values at low flow rates and by regulating angles of <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> to negative values at high flow rates. As the net positive suction head decreases, the vapor fraction first increases slowly and then increases greatly, clearly presenting cavitation process from inception to full development, which can be used to predict the required net positive suction head. When net positive suction head decreases to the value around required net positive suction head, the cavitation zone from tip of blade suction side close to leading edge and the cavitation zone from hub part of the blade suction side connect together. After the connection, the cavitation zones have great influence on the velocity flow, leading to the decrease in pump performance...|$|R

40|$|Variable <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> (IGV) is used {{to control}} the mass flow and {{generate}} prewhirl in centrifugal compressors. The efficient operation of IGV {{is limited to the}} range of aerodynamic characteristics of their vane profiles. In order to find out the best vane profile for IGV regulation, the modern optimization method was adopted to optimize the <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> profile. The main methodology idea was to use artificial neural network for continuous fitness evaluation and use genetic algorithm for global optimization. After optimization, the regulating performance of IGV has improved significantly, the prewhirl ability has been enhanced greatly, and the pressure loss has been reduced. The mass flow and power of compressor reduced by using the optimized guide vane at large setting angles, and the efficiency increased significantly; the flow field distribution has been improved obviously, since the nonuniform distribution of flow and flow separation phenomenon greatly weakened or even completely disappeared. The achievement of this research can effectively improve the regulation ability of IGV and the performance of compressor...|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> {{with the}} 24 -inch {{supersonic}} compressor {{resulted in a}} decrease in maximum pressure ratio and adiabatic efficiency, and {{a slight increase in}} equivalent mass flow. The loss in total pressure and efficiency resulted from reduced diffusion in the rotor-blade passages, increased shock losses at the higher entrance Mach number, and increased mixing separation, and transfer of mass flow toward the rotor hub. The unsteady flow field created at the compressor entrance by the guide-vane wakes is also responsible for some of the losses. This inherent loss will be encountered whenever <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vanes</b> are used with the shock-in-rotor type of supersonic compressor...|$|R

The data were analyzed and correlated with the existing velocity profile correlations. The end wall losses were also derived from these data...|$|E
40|$|A 0. 5 hub/tip radius ratio {{compressor}} stage {{consisting of a}} 1500 ft/sec tip speed rotor, a variable camber <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> and a variable stagger stator was designed and tested with undistorted inlet flow, flow with tip radial distortion, and flow with 90 degrees, one-per-rev, circumferential distortion. At the design speed and design IGV and stator setting the design stage pressure ratio was achieved at a weight within 1 % of the design flow. Analytical results on rotor tip shock structure, deviation angle and part-span shroud losses at different operating conditions are presented. The variable geometry blading enabled efficient operation with adequate stall margin at the design condition and at 70 % speed. Closing the inlet guide vanes to 40 degrees changed the speed-versus-weight flow relationship along the stall line and thus provided the flexibility of operation at off-design conditions. Inlet flow distortion caused considerable losses in peak efficiency, efficiency on a constant throttle line through design pressure ratio at design speed, stall pressure ratio, and stall margin at the 0 degrees IGV setting and high rotative speeds. The use of the 40 degrees <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> setting enabled partial recovery of the stall margin over the standard constant throttle line...|$|E

Hot-wire measurements taken in the rotor-stator axial gap have been ensemble-averaged to determine periodic fluctuations in turbulence level and velocity. These results are compared to measurements made at low turbulence levels without the turbulence grid.

40|$|Abstract: In a {{conventional}} one-dimensional scheme design of centrifugal fans and compres-sors, {{it is assumed}} that there is no flow prewhirl at the impeller inlet when the <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane</b> is absent. However, many experiments have proved that the flow prewhirl does exist at the inlet of centrifugal impellers. This results in an error in the design of centrifugal fans and compressors. In this study a new method is presented to calculate the Euler work of centrifugal impellers con-sidering the presence of an inlet flow prewhirl in the case without the <b>inlet</b> <b>guide</b> <b>vane.</b> Stodola’s approachdealingwith the slip velocity at the impeller outlet is applied to the impeller inlet. A new formula for Euler work calculation is deduced to evaluate the effect of the inlet prewhirl. The new formula has been applied to 33 industrial centrifugal fans and the calculated results have been compared with the experimental data of these fans. The comparison shows that the new formula is more accurate in most cases than the original formula without consideration of the inlet flow prewhirl, and the accuracy has been improved by more than 10 per cent on average. The aim {{of this study is to}} improve the accuracy of the one-dimensional scheme design of centrifugal fans and to provide a reference for a similar research...|$|E
