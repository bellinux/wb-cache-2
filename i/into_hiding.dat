40|$|We {{study in}} detail MSW-like {{resonant}} conversions of QCD axions <b>into</b> <b>hidden</b> axions, including {{cases where the}} adiabaticity condition is only marginally satisfied, and where anharmonic effects are non-negligible. When the resonant conversion is efficient, the QCD axion abundance is suppressed by the hidden and QCD axion mass ratio. We find that, when the resonant conversion is incomplete due to a weak violation of the adiabaticity, the CDM isocurvature perturbations can be significantly suppressed, while non-Gaussianity of the isocurvature perturbations generically remain unsuppressed. The isocurvature bounds on the inflation scale can therefore be relaxed by the partial resonant conversion of the QCD axions <b>into</b> <b>hidden</b> axions.

5|$|The {{day after}} Clifford's death {{the bulk of}} the Yorkist and Lancastrian armies faced each other at the Battle of Towton. After what is now {{considered}} the biggest and possibly bloodiest battle ever to take place on English soil, the Lancastrians were routed, and the son of the duke of York was crowned King Edward IV. On 4 November 1461, at Edward's first parliament, Clifford was attainted and his estates and barony forfeited to the king; a large portion were later granted to the earl of Warwick. The story– which would later be repeated by George Edward Cokayne in his Complete Peerage– of how Clifford's widow, fearing her son, Henry, would be slain in retaliation for Rutland's death, sent him <b>into</b> <b>hiding</b> as a shepherd, is almost certainly a folklore. As Dr James Ross has pointed out, the young Henry Clifford was pardoned in 1472, and as early as 1466 was named publicly as receiving a bequest, although Ross does suggest that Henry may well have gone <b>into</b> <b>hiding</b> for a time from his father's enemies.|$|E

The warrant against Aurobindo was withdrawn.|$|E

40|$|The DELPHI {{experiment}} at LEP has {{measured the}} inclusive charmless B hadron decay branching ratio, the B branching ratio into two charmed particles, {{and the total}} number of charmed particles per B decay, using the hadronic Z data taken between 1992 and 1995. The results are extracted from a fit to the b-tagging probability distribution based on the precise impact parameter measurements made using the microvertex detector. The inclusive charmless B branching ratio, including B decays <b>into</b> <b>hidden</b> charm (c (c) over bar), is measured to be 0. 033 +/- 0. 021. The B branching ratio into two open charmed particles is 0. 136 +/- 0. 042. The mean number of charmed particles per B decay (including hidden charm) is 1. 147 +/- 0. 041. After subtracting the B decay branching ratio <b>into</b> <b>hidden</b> charm, the charmless B branching ratio is found to be 0. 007 +/- 0. 021, compatible with the Standard Model expectation. Models that predict an additional contribution to the charmless B branching ratio of 0. 037 or higher are excluded with at least 95 % confidence. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V.
