5|$|Sundiata Acoli, Assata Shakur, Trooper Harper, and a New Jersey Turnpike {{driver who}} saw {{part of the}} {{incident}} were the only surviving witnesses. Acoli did not testify or make any pre-trial statements, nor did he testify in his own trial or give {{a statement to the}} police. The driver traveling north on the turnpike testified that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> State Trooper struggling with a Black man between a white vehicle and a State Trooper car, whose revolving lights illuminated the area.|$|E
5|$|The four-engined {{chartered}} propliner departed Columbia, South Carolina, at 15:24 EST, {{and landed}} in Newark, New Jersey, at 17:37, where it picked up its first group of 26 passengers. It departed at 18:22 for Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania, where it picked up 31 additional passengers. At 19:12 it departed for Baltimore, Maryland, where it picked up a final group of 17 passengers and departed for South Carolina at 20:30. During these flight segments, as he would later testify at the CAB hearing, the flight engineer opened the cross feed valves between the number three and four engines, since <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> drop in fuel pressure on the number 3 fuel pressure gauge after the initial takeoff from Columbia.|$|E
5|$|The Structure and Distribution of Coral Reefs, Being {{the first}} part of the geology of the voyage of the Beagle, under the command of Capt. Fitzroy, R.N. during the years 1832 to 1836, was {{published}} in 1842 as Charles Darwin's first monograph, and set out his theory of the formation of coral reefs and atolls. He conceived of the idea during the voyage of the Beagle while still in South America, before <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> coral island, and wrote it out as HMS Beagle crossed the Pacific Ocean, completing his draft by November 1835. At the time there was great scientific interest in the way that coral reefs formed, and Captain Robert FitzRoy's orders from the Admiralty included the investigation of an atoll as an important scientific aim of the voyage. FitzRoy chose to survey the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean. The results supported Darwin's theory that the various types of coral reefs and atolls could be explained by uplift and subsidence of vast areas of the Earth's crust under the oceans.|$|E

5|$|The first {{mention of}} rings around Neptune {{dates back to}} 1846 when William Lassell, the {{discoverer}} of Neptune's largest moon, Triton, thought <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> ring around the planet. However, his claim was never confirmed {{and it is likely}} that it was an observational artifact. The first reliable detection of a ring was made in 1968 by stellar occultation, although that result would go unnoticed until 1977 when the rings of Uranus were discovered. Soon after the Uranus discovery, a team from Villanova University led by Harold J. Reitsema began searching for rings around Neptune. On 24 May 1981, they detected a dip in a star's brightness during one occultation; however, {{the manner in which the}} star dimmed did not suggest a ring. Later, after the Voyager fly-by, it was found that the occultation was due to the small Neptunian moon Larissa, a highly unusual event.|$|E
5|$|Alternatively, Lindemann {{may have}} left his combat {{position}} when the ship's controls were rendered inoperable, and {{prior to the}} lethal hit on the command position, {{in order to give}} the command to abandon the ship. The surviving Matrose Paul Hillen—who had managed to escape to the upper deck in the final phase of the battle, stated that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> group of 20–30 people standing at the bow, among them a man with a white peaked cap. Normally on a German naval vessel at sea, a white cap is worn only by the commanding officer. In addition, the surviving Maschinengefreiter—Rudolf Römer, who at the time was already in the water—claimed that he had seen Lindemann standing on the bow, near Bismarcks forward 38cm turret, Anton. He was said to be with his combat messenger, a leading seaman, and apparently trying to persuade his messenger to save himself. In this account, his messenger took Lindemann's hand and the two walked to the forward flagmast. As the ship turned over, the two stood briefly to attention, then Lindemann and his messenger saluted. As the ship rolled to port, the messenger fell into the water. Lindemann continued his salute while clinging to the flagmast, going under with the ship.|$|E

25|$|In February 1807, Jackall towed Thames, Maule, master, on {{a voyage}} from London to Jamaica, into Ramsgate after Thames ran into {{difficulties}} off Fecamp.

25|$|In 1949, Tombaugh {{had also}} told the Naval missile {{director}} at White Sands Missile Range, Commander Robert McLaughlin, that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> bright flash on Mars on August 27, 1941, which he now attributed to an atomic blast.

25|$|The {{following}} day, Tandy {{was working}} on his fencing foil, with the handle held in a vice. Although there was nothing touching it, the blade started to vibrate wildly. Further investigation led Tandy {{to discover that the}} extractor fan in the lab was emitting a frequency of 18.98Hz, very close to the resonant frequency of the eye given as 18Hz by NASA. This, Tandy conjectured, was why <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> ghostly figure—it was, he believed, an optical illusion caused by his eyeballs resonating. The room was exactly half a wavelength in length, and the desk was in the centre, thus causing a standing wave which caused the vibration of the foil.|$|E
25|$|The French cycling union, the Union Vélocipédique Française, {{heard from}} dozens of {{competitors}} and witnesses and in December disqualified all the stage winners and the first four finishers: Garin, Pothier, César Garin, and Hippolyte Aucouturier. The UVF did not say precisely {{what had happened and}} the details were lost when Tour archives were transported south in 1940 to avoid the German invasion and never seen again. Stories spread of riders spreading tacks on the road to delay rivals with punctures, of riders being poisoned by each other or by rival fans.

25|$|A {{few days}} before Pentecost, one of Fredrick's {{soldiers}} named Ludwig of Helfenstein reported that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> white clad warrior, identified as Saint George, on a white horse attacking the Turks, and the chronicled accounts provide no evidence that anyone doubted him. On the evening of May 13, 1190, Frederick's troops were ordered to confess their sins and received penance. During the battle on May 14, the priests and bishops (at the risk of injury or death) went to the front, among the troops, to pray, wearing their white stoles that made them obvious targets for the Muslims. The invocation of Saint George for help had by then become the standard battle cry of the soldiers. The crusaders prevailed in the battle and captured Iconium on May 16, 1190.|$|E
25|$|The {{foundation}} of Puebla {{begins with a}} letter from the bishop of Tlaxcala in 1530, Julián Garcés, to the Spanish queen outlining the need for a Spanish settlement between Mexico City and the port of Veracruz. According to legend, the bishop had a dream about where to build the city. In this dream, he saw a valley with woods and meadows crossed by a clear river and dotted with fresh-water springs on fertile land. While he was contemplating this scenery, he supposedly saw a group of angels descend from heaven and trace out the city. Convinced <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> divine vision, he celebrated Mass, and took some of the brothers out in search of the place. Five leagues from the monastery he declared they had found the place shown in the dream. This legend is the source of Puebla’s original name, Puebla de los Ángeles, and its current nickname Angelópolis (literally, City of Angels).|$|E
25|$|The marble herm {{figure with}} the bearded head of philosopher type, bearing the {{explicit}} inscription, {{must be taken}} as purely conventional. Unidentified portrait heads did not find a ready market in post-Renaissance Rome. This bust was formerly {{in the collection of}} marchese Pietro Massimi at Palazzo Massimi and belonged to marchese L. Massimi at the time the engraving was made. It is now in the Villa Albani, Rome (inv. 1034). The inscribed bust has often been illustrated in engravings and photographs: a photograph of it forms the frontispiece to the Loeb Classical Library Theophrastus: Enquiry into Plants vol. I, 1916. André Thevet illustrated in his iconographic compendium, Les vraies Pourtrats et vies des Hommes Illustres (Paris, 1584), an alleged portrait plagiarized from the bust, supporting his fraud with the invented tale that he had obtained it from the library of a Greek in Cyprus and that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> confirming bust in the ruins of Antioch.|$|E

25|$|On 21 February 2001, {{police arrested}} Field at his flat in Birmingham. Field {{was held in}} police custody for more than the {{lawfully}} prescribed 24 hours in order to assist the investigation. He denied knowing Tutill or having {{anything to do with}} his death, and whilst admitting to his historic offences against boys said he had put that behaviour behind him. Just before Field was put into his cell for a third night he had been asked to submit DNA samples. Field could not sleep that night and the following day he confessed in detail to the abduction, rape and murder of Tutill. He said <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> boy get off a bus and thumb for a lift and that he had picked him up. He said he drove the boy to a layby where he anally raped him over the front seat.

25|$|Shortly before 1pm a {{submarine}} surfaced {{ahead of the}} ships and ordered them to stop. Filey attempted to ram the submarine, which submerged but fired a torpedo at the tanker. Von Rosenberg reported that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> tanker under escort by ships flying the white ensign and had seen no flag on the escorted ship. After firing the torpedo, he spotted a US flag on the tanker, so broke off the attack. At 12:50 an explosion took place sending a column of water into the air alongside Gulflight's starboard bow. The ship immediately started to sink and shortly the forward deck was awash. The crew abandoned ship and were taken onboard by the patrol ship Iago which turned towards St Mary island. At about 2.30 am Captain Gunter from the Gulflight was taken ill and died around 3:40 am from a heart attack. The remainder of the crew arrived at St. Mary 10 am on Sunday 2 May. The Gulflight did not sink but instead was towed to Crow Bay by patrol vessels. Ralph Smith, previously first officer, was now invited to inspect the ship, which was examined by divers and had a large hole in the starboard bow. Smith and the first engineer remained with Gulflight while {{the remainder of the}} crew were evacuated to Penzance.|$|E
25|$|Nomura's father {{influenced}} {{his interest}} in art and games early on, creating little drawings and unique Sugoroku board games for him. Nomura started drawing {{at the age of}} three years and developed his own Sugoroku games during his elementary school years. As a child, he spent much of his free time playing baseball, swimming, fishing and building fortresses. When he was in middle school, his father told him that an era of computers would come and bought him his own computer. Nomura played Legends of Star Arthur: Planet Mephius on it and started creating his own video games by learning programming. He first tried a Nintendo product with the tennis and ping-pong variant of the Color TV Game console and later borrowed a Family Computer in high school. Around that time, Dragon Warrior became Nomura's favorite because it surprised him and introduced him to video games with story elements. His art teacher in high school pointed him towards the works of Final Fantasy illustrator Yoshitaka Amano. Nomura also created his own manga during class and intended to do this as a profession although he ultimately abandoned the idea. Nomura went to vocational school to learn magazine and advertising artwork. Nomura then looked for an advertising job at a publishing company. However, he eventually applied at the video game company Square after <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>seen</b> <b>a</b> job advertisement with a drawing by Yoshitaka Amano.|$|E
