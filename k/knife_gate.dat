5000|$|A sluice (from the Dutch [...] "sluis") is a {{water channel}} {{controlled}} at its head by a gate. A mill race, leet, flume, penstock or lade is a sluice channelling water toward a water mill. The terms sluice, sluice gate, <b>knife</b> <b>gate,</b> and slide gate are used interchangeably {{in the water}} and wastewater control industry.|$|E
50|$|Pipe {{fittings}} are moulded {{and come}} in many sizes: tee 90° equal (straight and reducing), tee 45°, cross equal, elbow 90° (straight and reducing), elbow 45°, short radius bend 90° socket/coupler (straight and reducing), union, end caps, reducing bush, and stub, full face, and blanking flanges.Valves are moulded and also come in many types: ball valves (also multiport valve), butterfly valves, spring-, ball-, and swing-check non-return valves, diaphragm valves, <b>knife</b> <b>gate</b> valve, globe valves and pressure relief/reduction valves.Accessories are solvents, cleaners, glues, clips, backing rings, and gaskets.|$|E
5000|$|A gate valve, {{also known}} as a sluice valve, is a valve which opens by lifting a round or {{rectangular}} gate/wedge out of the path of the fluid. The distinct feature of a gate valve is the sealing surfaces between the gate and seats are planar, so gate valves are often used when a straight-line flow of fluid and minimum restriction is desired. The gate faces can be parallel, but are most commonly wedge-shaped. Gate valves are primarily used to permit or prevent the flow of liquids, but typical gate valves shouldn't be used for regulating flow, unless they are specifically designed for that purpose. Because of their ability to cut through liquids, gate valves are often used in the petroleum industry. For extremely thick fluids, a specialty valve often known as a <b>knife</b> <b>gate</b> valve is used to cut through the liquid. [...] On opening the gate valve, the flow path is enlarged in a highly nonlinear manner with respect to percent of opening. This means that flow rate does not change evenly with stem travel. Also, a partially open gate tends to vibrate from the fluid flow. Most of the flow change occurs near shutoff with a relatively high fluid velocity causing gate and seat wear and eventual leakage if used to regulate flow. Typical gate valves are designed to be fully opened or closed. [...] When fully open, the typical gate valve has no obstruction in the flow path, resulting in very low friction loss.|$|E
5|$|Three {{different}} gate types {{require a}} specific manner of crossing. Double cone gates must be crossed in level flight, single cone gates must be crossed in a 90° angle, and slalom {{flying through the}} chicane <b>gates</b> (<b>knife</b> or level flying not mandatory).|$|R
40|$|This work {{describes}} a coupling between the 1 D {{method of characteristics}} (MOC) and the 3 D finite volume method of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The coupling method is applied to compressible flow in hydraulic systems. The MOC code is implemented {{as a set of}} boundary conditions in the OpenFOAM open source CFD software. The coupling is realized by two linear equations originating from the characteristics equation and the Riemann constant equation, respectively. The coupling method is validated using three simple water hammer cases and several coupling configurations. The accuracy and robustness are investigated with respect to the mesh size ratio across the interface and to 3 D flow features close to the interface. The method is finally applied to the transient flow caused by the closing and opening of a <b>knife</b> valve (<b>gate)</b> in a pipe, where the flow is driven by the difference in free surface elevation between two tanks. A small region surrounding the moving gate is resolved by CFD, using a dynamic mesh library, {{while the rest of the}} system is modeled by MOC. Minor losses are included in the 1 D region, corresponding to the contraction of the flow from the upstream tank into the pipe, a separate stationary flow regulation valve, and a pipe bend. The results are validated with experimental data. A 1 D solution is provided for comparison, using the static gate characteristics obtained from steady-state CFD simulations...|$|R
50|$|Sir Michael Marsh {{reveals that}} he needs Matt's blood to {{complete}} the black magic ritual that will open Raven's Gate. Marsh is about to stab the knife into Matt when Matt uses his powers to stop the knife. He defeats Marsh and frees himself and Richard. They escape to {{the lower levels of}} the power station but are followed by Mrs Deverill. She knocks out Richard and is about to kill Matt when Richard recovers and shoves Deverill into a pool of radioactive acid. Then they escape from Omega One by jumping into an underground river under the building. Back in the inner sanctum, the station's levels are at critical mass. The villagers panic and run out of the protective circle, killing them all and leaving Sir Michael Marsh alone. Marsh then realises there is a tiny drop of Matt's blood on the knife and stabs down with the <b>knife,</b> causing Raven's <b>Gate</b> to break and explode open. The King of the Old Ones climbs out of the portal and crushes Sir Michael to death. The power station then overloads and explodes, but all the heat and radiation is sucked into the gate, taking the Old Ones with it. The portal and the Gate are sealed and the Old Ones are once again trapped in their separate dimension.|$|R
40|$|Cross-flow {{pressure}} regulating valve structures are attractive for high-flow pressure control applications due to the decreased actuation force required and the reduced device footprint area. A <b>knife</b> <b>gate</b> valve was fabricated, controlling a flow of 1. 3 Nl/min at a supply pressure of 1. 5 bar.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the first area-optimized micromachined <b>knife</b> <b>gate</b> microvalve. In comparison to recent microvalves the pressure-flow performance is increased using out-of-plane actuators and an out-of-plane orifice. Three different actuator-gate designs and their fabrication are described. The valve features integrated therinal silicon/aluminum bimorph actuators where the aluminum layer forins the resistive heater {{as well as}} the bimorph material. The characterization of the actuators and of the pressure-flow perfon-nance is presented.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{methods for}} the wafer-level integration of {{shape memory alloy}} (SMA) and electrostatic actuators to functionalize MEMS devices. The integration methods are based on heterogeneous integration, which is the integration of different materials and technologies. Background information about the actuators and the integration method is provided. SMA microactuators offer the highest work density of all MEMS actuators, however, they are not yet a standard MEMS material, partially {{due to the lack}} of proper wafer-level integration methods. This thesis presents methods for the wafer-level heterogeneous integration of bulk SMA sheets and wires with silicon microstructures. First concepts and experiments are presented for integrating SMA actuators with <b>knife</b> <b>gate</b> microvalves, which are introduced in this thesis. These microvalves feature a gate moving out-of-plane to regulate a gas flow and first measurements indicate outstanding pneumatic performance in relation to the consumed silicon footprint area. This part of the work also includes a novel technique for the footprint and thickness independent selective release of Au-Si eutectically bonded microstructures based on localized electrochemical etching. Electrostatic actuators are presented to functionalize MEMS crossbar switches, which are intended for the automated reconfiguration of copper-wire telecommunication networks and must allow to interconnect a number of input lines to a number of output lines in any combination desired. Following the concepts of heterogeneous integration, the device is divided into two parts which are fabricated separately and then assembled. One part contains an array of double-pole single-throw S-shaped actuator MEMS switches. The other part contains a signal line routing network which is interconnected by the switches after assembly of the two parts. The assembly is based on patterned adhesive wafer bonding and results in wafer-level encapsulation of the switch array. During operation, the switches in these arrays must be individually addressable. Instead of controlling each element with individual control lines, this thesis investigates a row/column addressing scheme to individually pull in or pull out single electrostatic actuators in the array with maximum operational reliability, determined by the statistical parameters of the pull-in and pull-out characteristics of the actuators.

40|$|The work {{density of}} shape memory a lloy (SMA) exceeds {{that of other}} {{actuation}} mechani sms available at the microscale {{by at least one}} or der of magnitude and remains constant upon miniatu rization, thus making SMA actuators attractive for applications requiring high forces and large displacements. Despite its favorable charact eristics, full exploitation of SMA in Micro E lectro-Mechanical Systems (MEMS) has been hindered, partially {{because of a lack of}} cost-efficient an d robust integration methods. This thesis addresse s this issue and presents novel manufacturing sche mes for fabricating MEMS actuators using wafer-lev el integration of SMA wires to silicon struct ures. The SMA wires are integrated to a rrays of micromachined single crystalline sil icon cantilevers, which provide the cold state res et mechanism. The wires are eccentrically placed o nto the cantilever beams, thus providing ecce ntric loading of the cantilevers and resulting int o out-of-plane deflection. Tensioning of NiT i wires, alignment and placement to the wafer ¨is performed using specially built wire fram e tools and a coarse adhesive bonding approach. Anchoring of the wires to the individual devices is demonstrated using two different m ethods: the first method is based on adhesive bond ing of the SMA wires to the array of micromac hined cantilevers using a negative photoresist (SU - 8) and the actuators are operated using an extern al energy source. The second method uses elec troplating to form nickel anchors that both provid e a strong mechanical coupling between the SMA wir es and the silicon microstructures and that serve¨ as electrical contact pads. The fabricated actuato rs are operated using Joule heating of the SM A wires and exhibit both a high reliability d uring long term cycling and displacements that are ¨among the highest yet reported. High-flow g as valves serve as a case study to illus trate the benefits of the developed actu ators with respect to the current state-of-the-art. A new design for <b>knife</b> <b>gate</b> microvalves is presented and the first batch-manufactured si licon valves using SMA wires for actuation ar e fabricated. These microvalves allow controlling¨ high gas flows at a low voltage actuation and at l ow power consumption. status: publishe...|$|E
