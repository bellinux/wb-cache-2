40|$|Transparent {{films of}} poly(methyl methacrylate) /poly(vinyl acetate) blend with {{different}} concentrations were prepared by using solution-cast technique.

The study has been also extended to include {{the changes in the}} optical parameters including the band tail width and band gap energies <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>samples.</b> Moreover, <b>the</b> refractive index was calculated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> from specular reflection and absorption spectrum before and after exposure to UV and filtered radiation...|$|R
30|$|The {{exchange}} current densities <b>for</b> <b>the</b> as-deposited <b>samples</b> were generally {{lower than those}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dealloyed <b>samples.</b> <b>The</b> increase in {{exchange current}} density <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> after dealloying is more pronounced (over an order of magnitude) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> with larger initial Cu content. This increase cannot be explained purely {{by an increase in}} effective surface area. The measured capacitances generally increased by a factor of 2 to 3 after dealloying (Figure 5), so the additional increase in reactivity must be due to structural and compositional changes in the thin films.|$|R

25|$|Ellipsometry is a {{powerful}} technique for the measurement of the optical properties of a uniform surface. It involves measuring the polarization state of light following specular reflection from such a surface. This is typically done {{as a function of}} incidence angle or wavelength (or both). Since ellipsometry relies on reflection, it is not required <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> to be transparent to light or for its back side to be accessible.|$|E
25|$|The sample extrema can be {{used for}} a simple {{normality}} test, specifically of kurtosis: one computes the t-statistic of the sample maximum and minimum (subtracts sample mean and divides by the sample standard deviation), and if they are unusually large <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> size (as per the three sigma rule and table therein, or more precisely a Student's t-distribution), then the kurtosis of the sample distribution deviates significantly from that of the normal distribution.|$|E
30|$|<b>The</b> common {{condition}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{separation of}} the active materials from the aluminum foils would then be to use an HNO 3 concentration of 2  mol/L at 70  °C, and the separation would occur within 83  s for samples from all manufacturers. It would also be possible, however, to use lower temperatures which would work <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> from manufacturers A and B but would approximately double <b>the</b> separation time <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> from manufacturer C.

25|$|Each {{observation}} measures {{one or more}} properties (such as weight, location, color) of observable bodies distinguished {{as independent}} objects or individuals. In survey sampling, weights {{can be applied to}} the data to adjust <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> design, particularly stratified sampling. Results from probability theory and statistical theory are employed to guide the practice. In business and medical research, sampling is widely used for gathering information about a population. Acceptance sampling is used to determine if a production lot of material meets the governing specifications.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{collecting}} data from samples using the flow cytometer is termed 'acquisition'. Acquisition is mediated {{by a computer}} physically connected to the flow cytometer, and the software which handles the digital interface with the cytometer. The software is capable of adjusting parameters (e.g., voltage, compensation) <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> being tested, and also assists in displaying initial sample information while acquiring sample data to ensure that parameters are set correctly. Early flow cytometers were, in general, experimental devices, but technological advances have enabled widespread applications {{for use in a}} variety of both clinical and research purposes. Due to these developments, a considerable market for instrumentation, analysis software, as well as the reagents used in acquisition such as fluorescently labeled antibodies has developed.|$|E
25|$|Liquid {{chromatography}} (LC) is {{a method}} {{that in some ways}} is more powerful than GC, but can be coupled to mass spectrometry just as easily. In LC, the concerns involving sample preparation can be minimal. In LC, both the stationary and mobile phase can affect the separation, whereas in GC only the stationary phase should be influential. This allows <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>sample</b> preparation to be minimal if one is willing to adjust the stationary phase or mobile phase before running the sample. The primary concern is the concentration of analyte. If the concentration is too high then separation can be unsuccessful, but mass spectrometry as a detection method does not need complete separation, showing another benefit of coupling LC to a mass spectrometer.|$|E

40|$|The {{magnetism}} of Cr {{thin films}} in Fe/Cr multilayers was studied using 119 Sn subatomic layers {{inserted in the}} Cr layers as a Mo¨ssbauer probe for Cr layer thickness from 10 to 160 A. The size {{and direction of the}} Cr magnetic moments were inferred from the size and direction of the magnetic hyperfine fields at the Sn nuclear sites. The detected magnetic hyperfine fields indicate that the Cr magnetic moments reduce as the Cr layer thickness decreases, while they do not remarkably change {{as a function of the}} distance from the Fe/Cr interface. The magnetic hyperfine fields <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> grown at 200 °C are smaller and more oriented to the film plane than <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> grown at room temperature. These observations suggest that the magnetic frustration resulting from Fe/Cr interface imperfections is accommodated by the reduction of the Cr magnetic moments <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> grown at elevated temperatures, whereas it is accommodated by the reorientation of Cr magnetic moments toward the perpendicular direction to the Fe magnetic moments <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>samples</b> grown at lower temperatures...|$|R
