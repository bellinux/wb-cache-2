And in one of the most aristocratic districts of Paris, on Île Saint-Louis, where old marquises, counts and countesses, dukes and duchesses live, one respective lady suddenly asked me after my report: “Is it true, Monsieur Moskovitch, that unnatural relationships occur between the men in the colonial troops where you served during the war?” I answered her honestly, because you shouldn’t lie to your potential voters, so I told her: “Madame, even a black soldier will look to you like a beauty after six months in the desert!"

Either they think that talking about a purpose in life is a meaningless attempt to find out if they have a reason for living or it is a waste of time. Yet, it seems reasonable to me that every person should have a personal purpose; one that gives them hope and a future. Why? Because life is more than going to work and bringing home a pay check, however important. While life is mostly about getting a job, making money, paying the bills, getting married, raising a family, working and having fun, and many other expectations, the icing on the cake is a person’s dream and the work that goes into it.

40|$|Repeated {{exposures}} to thin-idealized body shapes may alter women’s perceptions of what normal (e. g., accepted) and ideal (e. g., desired) bodies {{in a cultural}} environment look like. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate whether exposure to thin and round body shapes may change the subsequent esthetic appreciation of others’ bodies and the perceptual and cognitive–affective dimensions of self-body image in patients suffering from anorexia nervosa (AN). Thirteen AN patients and 13 matched healthy controls were exposed to pictures of either thin or round unfamiliar body models and, before and after exposure, they were required to either express liking judgments about round and slim figures of unfamiliar bodies (esthetic task) or to adjust distorted pictures of their own body to their perceptual (How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>yourself?),</b> affective (How do you feel yourself?), metacognitive (How do others see you?) and ideal (How would you like to look like?) body image (self-body adjustment task). Brief {{exposures to}} round models increased liking judgments of round figures in both groups. However, only in AN patients, exposure to round models induced an increase in thin figures liking, which positively correlated with their preoccupation with dieting. Furthermore, exposure to round bodies in AN patients, but not in controls, increased the distortion for the perceptual body image and decreased the size of the ideal one. No differences between the two groups were obtained after adaptation to thin models. Our results suggest that AN patients’ perception of their own and others’ body is more easily malleable by exposure to round figures as compared to controls. Crucially, this mechanism may strongly contribute to the development and maintenance of self-body image disturbances. © 2015, Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|E
40|$|Reflexivity {{has been}} a focal theme in much recent youth research, {{including}} my own. This theme connects studies of identity construction, subject form­ation and text reception with diagnoses of cultural modernization and method­o­log­ic­al issues of qualitative ethnography. Popular-cultural mass-media texts are continuously drawn into reflexive practices in everyday life, appar­ent­ly in increasingly intense and complex ways. ‘Reflexivity’ derives from the Latin ‘reflectere’: fold back. What is being folded back in cultural con­texts are thoughts or symbol­i­za­tions. Human sub­jects may {{be more or less}} reflexive, as people use texts (from talk and gestures to books and computers) in self-mirroring identity construct­ions, by explicitly defining who they are. Cultural texts may also be (more or less) reflexive, in two possible senses. A text (dialogue, magazine, film, etc.) may be auto-reflexive, i. e., mirror itself, thematize or make explicit its own construction. Advertisements or tele­vision programmes nowadays often depict how ads or TV works, sometimes in an ironical mode (cf. Hutcheon, 1980 / 1984; Stam, 1985 / 1992). Texts may secondly also be subject-reflexive, i. e., mirror the self-mirror­ings of human individuals and problematize the identities of the subjects who are symbolically produced in these texts. Some youth cultural texts (including words, songs and images) used and/or made by young people depict the pro­cess of reflexive sub­ject formation as an explicitly formulated theme. All these forms of reflexivity are closely inter­con­nect­ed, since reflexive texts mirror reflexive practices and in turn are used as mirrors in them. But it is this last sense of reflexivity as a theme in youth cultural texts, bridging subject‑ and text-reflexivity, which will be ana­lyz­ed here. The final, definitive version of this paper has been published in: Young: Nordic Journal of Youth Research, (3), 2, 3 - 22, 1995.

Este estudo buscou compreender como a mulher docente de enfermagem percebe seu corpo em sua atuação docente. A pesquisa qualitativa foi usada com a abordagem fenomenológica. Participaram da investigação dez mulheres docentes de enfermagem de uma universidade pública. Seus depoimentos foram coletados por meio de entrevistas com as seguintes questões norteadoras: Como você se vê como mulher e docente de enfermagem? Que significados você atribui ao seu corpo, sendo mulher e docente de enfermagem? Como você utiliza o seu corpo no ensino da enfermagem?Como você percebe a postura {{corporal}} dos alunos de enfermagem? O que você observa neles que considera serem respostas às suas posturas corporais?Os discursos foram analisados e interpretados à luz do referencial teórico-filosófico de Maurice Merleau-Ponty, originando-se três temas: Corporeidade: expressão da vivência, Corporeidade o ser mulher, Corporeidade e a docência de enfermagem. Os resultados do estudo permitiram compreender que a mulher, docente de enfermagem, utiliza-se de seu corpo e corporeidade em sua prática pedagógica, tendo intencionalidades e ações que demonstram a consciência do corpo, além dos aspectos meramente biológicos. Atribuem ao corpo-corporeidade significados importantes que podem contribuir na existência do ser mulher docente de enfermagem e, certamente, repercutir na prática e no conhecimento em enfermagemBy {{means of}} the body and corporality, choices can be made that affect interaction with others in a real and authentic manner, as well as intervene in aspects related to the nature of human phenomena: change, creation, sharing, teaching, transformation and being transformed. This study sought to comprehend how a woman professor of nursing perceives her body in her professional practice. Qualitative research was used with a phenomenological approach. Ten women participated in the investigation, all professors of nursing at a public university. Their statements were collected by means of interviews with the following questions: How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>yourself</b> as a woman and professor of nursing? What meanings have you attributed to your body as a woman and a professor of nursing? How do you utilize your body in the teaching of nursing? How do you perceive the corporal posture of your nursing students? What do you observe in them that you consider responses to your corporal postures? The statements were analyzed and interpreted in light of the theoretical-philosophical reference of Maurice Merleau-Ponty, giving rise to three themes: Corporality: expression of existence, Corporality of the woman being, Corporality and the teaching of nursing. The results of the study showed that the woman professor of nursing utilizes her body and corporality in her professorial practice, having intentionalities and actions that demonstrate an awareness of the body beyond mere biological aspects. They attribute to body-corporality important meanings that can contribute to the existence of the woman professor of nursing and, certainly, have repercussions on the practice and understanding of nursin...|$|E

40|$|It s {{thanks to}} his travels that he finally meets up with Spore, which he uses a lot on his farm. We first met on a Roman {{hillside}} in Italy, where he was organising farmers encounters during the World Food Summit. A month later, on another hill, in Brussels, Belgium, {{we caught up with}} him again. He took time out from his course on globalisation to wrap up our interview. He s visibly taken aback at the question: Do you still regard yourself as a young person? 'Sorry to say so, but no. When I look at all the problems affecting youth today, especially in rural areas, I can t call myself young anymore. I am bound to look at myself as an adult, who can do something for young people. I m an adult because I feel I have to help them. If I thought I was still young myself, then I would have to wait to be an adult, and I don t want to wait. ' Has he always been so impatient? He looks back, with a room-size laugh, at 'when it all started. It was on 28 th November 1990 that I came back home to my village, Torba 1, 138 kilometres east of the capital Yaoundé. I had qualifications under the belt, and I was a parish adviser and leader of small group of just six young people. ' So where does youth stop, or is it eternal? 'As far as MIJARC is concerned, at both national and international levels, it is between the ages of 15 and 35. Of course, it varies from culture to culture. Some of our members may even be in their fifties, but we insist that office-holders are between 15 and 35. ' How about being a farmer, how <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>yourself</b> there? He pounces back, as if being a farmer is eternal. 'Oh yes, not a shadow of doubt. I am a farmer, I shall forever be a farmer, even if I end up doing something else. Right now on my farm, we are harvesting our field of groundnuts. My wife and I have five hectares. ' He looks a tad forlorn about being away from home. 'I m not so sure she copes on her own like that. When I m in the country, I go home every weekend to work with her. And when I m away, I pay for someone to help her, to stand in for me. ' 'I have always been focused on farming. My life-long project is centred on agriculture. Nothing will please me more than if things work out well with my farm; I shall stop all the other things that I do. It s where I can do the most for my family and for others, where I can be sure to raise my family well. And it can serve as a statement for people who follow me. I shall be able to say Listen here, you d be better off trying this seed or that one. The thing is that young people don t know how to choose seeds; they re full of goodwill but a bit short on experience. When I started I didn t have any experience either. That s what I would like to put right. I want to make a practical statement. ' Statements are important to you, right? 'Very. They re what attracts people s attention, especially young kids. We should not be sitting around, not when they are wanting to get on with their lives. They can do a lot, they re full of potential, they need the chance, to build up their confidence. I also want to make a statement to those adults who could be doing something, but aren t, for young people; I want to get them to work too. ' All well and good, but isn t it the case that young people in the village have absolutely no choice but to stay? 'Absolutely, none at all. It s impossible to get a job in town; there s next to no recruitment going on, and, you know, even when a young man has got qualifications, he ll most likely have a wife and children too, so how can you expect him to live in the city? They ll stay at home, in the village. But to survive there, they ll be needing some knowledge. ' So being a farmer is just something you have to do? His eyes flash, we ve touched a raw nerve here. 'Listen, listen good. Being a farmer is a matter of pride, you have to be proud of being a farmer. Some of the kids in the village say that they ended up there by accident. They really wanted a good job in town, or in Europe or America. That s not the attitude to take. The education system has taught them to think like that. We ll only get our pride if we change the content of education. ' 'But there are other barriers too. Top of the list is the traditional one about having access to land. You may have the skills you need but you won t get very far if you haven t got the land The second issue is about being able to invest. As well as skills, you need to have real money to start off with. And then young people don t have any collateral, can t get a guarantee, and so they won t get any loans from the banks. That s really disappointing for them. ' He s gone almost sullen. Let s talk about change, what should be changed? 'We need to have a thorough review of our rural advisory services, and liberalise their management. Then we need to appoint advisors and workers with a specific focus on youth. If we stick to a service full of generalists, we re going to make all sorts of compromises to try to keep everyone happy. At the end of the day, it s the young person who s going to be left to fend for himself. If, on the other hand, we have a focused set-up, we can devote the proper attention to young people, with lots of energy and commitment, and then things will move. ' It sounds rather similar to the positive discrimination towards women that got some things rolling, gender-wise, 20 years ago. 'That s right. We should be talking of women-focused strategies in the same breath as youth-focused ones. We should even bring in child-focused issues. That should be the priority today because it helps to define the world of tomorrow. ' How about CTA, do you see it as a partner for young people? 'Easy. CTA has an important role to play in shaping attitudes, through training, as well as an information task. So it should be joining in those efforts which aim to help young people to better understand agriculture, to love it, and to get into it.
