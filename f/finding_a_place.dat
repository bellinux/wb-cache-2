For example, in America in 2012 there were some 78 million dogs, 86 million cats, and 3.5 million rabbits. There is a tension between the role of animals as companions to humans, and their existence as individuals with rights of their own.|$|E
5|$|Thom {{wished to}} examine whether or not prehistoric peoples used high-accuracy astronomy. He {{believed}} that by using horizon astronomy, observers could make estimates of dates in the year to a specific day. The observation required <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> where on a specific date the sun set into a notch on the horizon. A common theme is a mountain which blocked the Sun, but on the right day would allow the tiniest fraction to re-emerge {{on the other side}} for a 'double sunset'. The animation below shows two sunsets at a hypothetical site, one the day before the summer solstice and one at the summer solstice, which has a double sunset.|$|E
5|$|For Halloween II, Zombie {{decided to}} focus more on the {{connection}} between Laurie and Michael, and the idea they share similar psychological problems. Zombie wanted the sequel to be more realistic and violent than its 2007 predecessor. For the characters of Halloween II, it is about change. Zombie wanted to look at how the events of the first film affected the characters. Zombie also wanted to show the connection between Laurie and Michael, and provide a glimpse into each character's psyche. Filming primarily took place in Georgia, which provided Zombie with a tax incentive as well as the visual look the director was going for with the film. When it came time to provide a musical score, Zombie had trouble <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to include John Carpenter's original Halloween theme music. Although Carpenter's theme was used throughout Zombie's remake, the theme was only included in the final shot of this film.|$|E

25|$|New Zealand's first Orange lodge {{was founded}} in Auckland in 1842, only {{two years after the}} country became part of the British Empire, by James Carlton Hill of County Wicklow. The lodge {{initially}} had problems <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to meet, as several landlords were threatened by Irish Catholic immigrants for hosting it. The arrival of large numbers of British troops to fight the New Zealand land wars of the 1860s provided a boost for New Zealand Orangeism, and in 1867 a North Island Grand Lodge was formed. A decade later a South Island Grand Lodge was formed, and the two merged in 1908.|$|E

25|$|Willow {{chooses to}} attend college with Buffy in Sunnydale {{although}} she is accepted to prestigious schools elsewhere. Her relationships with Buffy and Xander become strained {{as they try to}} find their place following high school. Willow becomes much more confident in college, finally <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> that respects her intellect, while Buffy has difficulty in classes and Xander does not attend school. Willow's relationship with Oz continues until a female werewolf appears on the scene, aggressively pursuing him, and he leaves town to learn how to control the wolf within. She becomes depressed and explores magic more deeply, often with powerful but inconsistent results. She joins the campus Wicca group, meeting Tara Maclay, eventually falling in love with and choosing to be with her even when Oz returns to Sunnydale after apparently getting his lycanthropic tendencies under control.|$|E
25|$|The scene {{gradually}} became increasingly {{common in the}} art of the Western church, and increasingly rare in Orthodox art. Various themes in theological exegesis of the event influenced the treatment in art. As the first drawing of Christ's blood, it was also seen as a forerunner of, or even the first scene of, the Passion of Christ, {{and was one of the}} Seven Sorrows of Mary. Other interpretations developed based on it as the naming ceremony equivalent to Christian baptism, the aspect which was eventually to become most prominent in Catholic thinking. Both in this respect and in terms of <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> in a pictorial cycle, consideration of the circumcision put it in a kind of competition with the much better established Presentation of Jesus; eventually the two scenes were to be conflated in some paintings.|$|E
25|$|The {{feeling that}} the early 20th century was an era of {{economic}} growth due to technological advances contrasted dramatically with {{the standard of living}} of lower social classes. The growth of the previous decades led to an unprecedented population explosion starting in 1929. The Great Depression caused the collapse of the nitrate industry in the north, leaving 60,000 unemployed, which added to the decline in agricultural exports, resulting in a total number for the unemployed to be about 300,000 nationwide. These unemployed workers saw Santiago and its booming industry as the only chance to survive. Many migrants arrived in Santiago with nothing and thousands had to survive on the streets due to the great difficulty in <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> they could rent. Widespread disease, including tuberculosis, claimed the lives of hundreds of the homeless. Unemployment and living costs increased dramatically whilst the salaries of the population of Santiago fell.|$|E

Once there, she tried to tell him about Henry, only to discover that he had died while saving a family from a burning building.

After Emma's reunion of the children with Michael that evening, Henry arrived with pumpkin pie to give Emma in order to thank her for explaining about his birth father. They are interrupted by a stranger (Eion Bailey) on a motorcycle with a unique box. Without giving his name, he asks Emma about <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> to stay. After referring him to Granny's Bed & Breakfast, she reminds Henry that he said no one else ever comes to or leaves Storybrooke and Henry replies that they don't.|$|E

500|$|On July 5, {{with the}} Indians in Chicago {{in the midst}} of a road trip, Doby made his debut as the second black {{baseball}} player after Robinson to play in the majors after establishment of the baseball color line. Veeck hired two plainclothes police officers to accompany Doby as he went to Comiskey Park. Player-manager Lou Boudreau initially had a hard time <b>finding</b> <b>a</b> <b>place</b> in the lineup for Doby, who had played second base and shortstop for most of his career. Boudreau himself was the regular shortstop, while Joe Gordon was the second baseman. That day, Doby met his new teammates for the first time. [...] "I walked down that line, stuck out my hand, and very few hands came back in return. Most of the ones that did were cold-fish handshakes, along with a look that said, 'You don't belong here", Doby reminisced years later. Four of Doby's teammates did not shake his hand, and of those, two turned their backs to Doby when he tried to introduce himself. During warm-ups, Doby languished for minutes while his teammates interacted with one another. Not until Joe Gordon asked Doby to play catch with him was Doby given the chance to engage. Gordon befriended Doby and became one of his closest friends on the team.|$|E

30|$|As we {{see from}} the examples, a {{relocation}} is a last resort for the households. They move due to push factors, not because of minor qualitative improvements.
