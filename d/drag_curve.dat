5000|$|In {{order to}} allow {{the use of a}} G1 {{ballistic}} coefficient rather than velocity data Dr. Pejsa provided two reference drag curves. The first reference <b>drag</b> <b>curve</b> is based purely on the Siacci/Mayevski retardation rate function. The second reference <b>drag</b> <b>curve</b> is adjusted to equal the Siacci/Mayevski retardation rate function at a projectile velocity of 2600 fps (792.5 m/s) using a [...]30-06 Springfield Cartridge, Ball, Caliber [...]30 M2 [...] rifle spitzer bullet with a slope or deceleration constant factor of 0.5 in the supersonic flight regime. In other flight regimes the second Pejsa reference <b>drag</b> <b>curve</b> model uses slope constant factors of 0.0 or -4.0. These deceleration constant factors can be verified by backing out Pejsa's formulas (the <b>drag</b> <b>curve</b> segments fits the form V(2 - N) / C and the retardation coefficient curve segments fits the form V2 / (V(2 - N) / C) = C * VN where C is a fitting coefficient). The empirical test data Pejsa used to determine the exact shape of his chosen reference <b>drag</b> <b>curve</b> and pre-defined mathematical function that returns the retardation coefficient at a given Mach number was provided by the US military for the Cartridge, Ball, Caliber [...]30 M2 bullet. The calculation of the retardation coefficient function also involves air density, which Pejsa did not mention explicitly. The Siacci/Mayevski G1 model uses the following deceleration parametrization (60 °F, 30 inHg and 67% humidity, air density ρ = 1.2209 kg/m3). Dr. Pejsa suggests using the second <b>drag</b> <b>curve</b> because the Siacci/Mayevski G1 <b>drag</b> <b>curve</b> does not provide a good fit for modern spitzer bullets. To obtain relevant retardation coefficients for optimal long range modeling Dr. Pejsa suggested using accurate projectile specific down range velocity measurement data for a particular projectile to empirically derive the average retardation coefficient rather than using a reference <b>drag</b> <b>curve</b> derived average retardation coefficient. Further he suggested using ammunition with reduced propellant loads to empirically test actual projectile flight behavior at lower velocities. When working with reduced propellant loads utmost care must be taken to avoid dangerous or catastrophic conditions (detonations) with can occur when firing experimental loads in firearms.|$|E

50|$|The above example {{illustrates}} the central problem fixed <b>drag</b> <b>curve</b> models have. These models will only yield satisfactory accurate predictions {{as long as}} the projectile of interest has the same shape as the reference projectile or a shape that closely resembles the reference projectile. Any deviation from the reference projectile shape will result in less accurate predictions. How much a projectile deviates from the applied reference projectile is mathematically expressed by the form factor (i). The form factor can be used to compare the drag experienced by a projectile of interest to the drag experienced by the employed reference projectile at a given velocity (range). The problem that the actual <b>drag</b> <b>curve</b> of a projectile can significantly deviate from the fixed <b>drag</b> <b>curve</b> of any employed reference projectile systematically limits the traditional drag resistance modeling approach.

40|$|Recently {{proposed}} flight {{research at}} NASA Dryden Flight Research Center (DFRC) has prompted study into the aerodynamic effects of modifications {{made to the}} surfaces of laminar airfoils. The research {{is focused on the}} high-aspect ratio, laminar-flow type wings commonly found on UAVs and other aircraft with a high endurance requirement. A broad range of instrumentation possibilities, such as structural, pressure, and temperature sensing devices may require the alteration of the airfoil outer mold line as part of the installation process. This study attempts to characterize the effect of installing this additiona 1 instrumentation on key airfoil performance factors, such as transition location, lift and <b>drag</b> <b>curves,</b> and stall point. In particular, the general case of an airfoil that is channeled in the spanwise direction is considered, and the impact on key performance characteristics is assessed. Particular attention is focused on exploring the limits of channel depth and low-Reynolds number on performance and stall characteristics. To quantify the effect of increased skin friction due to premature transition caused by protruding or recessed instrumentation, two simplified, conservative scenarios are used to consider two potential sources of diaturbance: A) that leading edge alterations would cause linearly expanding areas (triangles) of turbulent flow on both surfaces of the wing upstream of the natural transition point, and B) that a channel or bump on the upper surface would trip turbulent flow across the whole upper surface upstream of the natural transition point. A potentially more important consideration than the skin friction drag increment is the change in overall airfoil performance due to the installation of instrumentation along most of the wingspan. To quantify this effect, 2 D CFD simulations of the flow over a representative mid-span airfoil section were conducted in order to assess the change in lift and <b>drag</b> <b>curves</b> for the airfoil in the presence of disturbed flow due to the installed instrumentation.

50|$|Besides the {{traditional}} <b>drag</b> <b>curve</b> models for several standard projectile shapes or types other more advanced drag models exist.

50|$|In aviation, {{induced drag}} {{tends to be}} greater at lower speeds because a high angle of attack is {{required}} to maintain lift, creating more drag. However, as speed increases the angle of attack can be reduced and the induced drag decreases. Parasitic drag, however, increases because the fluid is flowing more quickly around protruding objects increasing friction or drag. At even higher speeds (transonic), wave drag enters the picture. Each of these forms of drag changes {{in proportion to the}} others based on speed. The combined overall <b>drag</b> <b>curve</b> therefore shows a minimum at some airspeed - an aircraft flying at this speed will be at or close to its optimal efficiency.

50|$|A {{lift and}} <b>drag</b> <b>curve</b> {{obtained}} in wind tunnel testing is {{shown on the}} right. The curve represents an airfoil with a positive camber so some lift is produced at zero angle of attack. With increased angle of attack, lift increases in a roughly linear relation, called {{the slope of the}} lift curve. At about 18 degrees this airfoil stalls, and lift falls off quickly beyond that. The drop in lift {{can be explained by the}} action of the upper-surface boundary layer, which separates and greatly thickens over the upper surface at and past the stall angle. The thickened boundary layer's displacement thickness changes the airfoil's effective shape, in particular it reduces its effective camber, which modifies the overall flow field so as to reduce the circulation and the lift. The thicker boundary layer also causes a large increase in pressure drag, so that the overall drag increases sharply near and past the stall point.|$|E

50|$|In flight, {{induced drag}} {{results from the}} lift force that must be {{produced}} so that the craft can maintain level flight. Induced drag is greater at lower speeds where a high angle of attack is required. As speed increases, the induced drag decreases, but parasitic drag increases because the fluid is striking the object with greater force, and is moving across the object's surfaces at higher speed. As speed continues to increase into the transonic and supersonic regimes, wave drag grows in importance. Each of these drag components changes {{in proportion to the}} others based on speed. The combined overall <b>drag</b> <b>curve</b> therefore shows a minimum at some airspeed; an aircraft flying at this speed will be close to its optimal efficiency.

50|$|The {{greatest}} {{strength of the}} Pejsa model is that any projectile within a given flight regime (for example the supersonic flight regime) can be mathematically modeled well with only two velocity measurements, a distance between said velocity measurements, and a slope or deceleration constant factor. The model allows the <b>drag</b> <b>curve</b> to change slopes or curvature at three different points. Down range velocity measurement data can be provided around key inflection points allowing for more accurate calculations of the projectile retardation rate. The Pejsa model allows the slope factor to be tuned to account for subtle differences in the retardation rate of different bullet shapes and sizes. It ranges from 0.1 (flat-nose bullets) to 0.9 (very-low-drag bullets). If this slope or deceleration constant factor is unknown a default value of 0.5 will predict the flight behavior of most modern spitzer-type rifle bullets quite well. With the help of test firing measurements the slope constant for a particular bullet/rifle system/shooter combination can be determined. These test firings should preferably be executed at 60% and for extreme long range ballistic predictions also at 80% to 90% of the supersonic range of the projectiles of interest, staying away from erratic transonic effects. With this the Pejsa model can easily be tuned for the specific drag behavior of a specific projectile, making significant better (supersonic) ballistic predictions for ranges beyond 500 m (547 yd) possible. A practical downside of the Pejsa model is that accurate projectile specific down range velocity measurements to provide these better predictions {{can not be easily}} performed by the vast majority of shooting enthusiasts.|$|E
5000|$|Induced drag must {{be added}} to the {{parasitic}} drag to find the total drag. Since induced drag is inversely proportional to the square of the airspeed (at a given lift) whereas parasitic drag is proportional to the square of the airspeed, the combined overall <b>drag</b> <b>curve</b> shows a minimum at some airspeed - the minimum drag speed (VMD). An aircraft flying at this speed is operating at its optimal aerodynamic efficiency. According to the above equations, the speed for minimum drag occurs at the speed where the induced drag is equal to the parasitic drag. This is the speed at which for unpowered aircraft, optimum glide angle is achieved. This is also the speed for greatest range (although VMD will decrease as the plane consumes fuel and becomes lighter).The speed for greatest range (i.e., distance travelled) is the speed at which a straight line from the origin is tangent to the fuel flow rate curve. The curve of range versus airspeed is normally very flat and it is customary to operate at the speed for 99% best range since this gives about 5% greater speed for only 1% less range. (Of course, flying higher where the air is thinner will raise the speed at which minimum drag occurs, and so permits a faster voyage for the same amount of fuel. If the plane is flying at the maximum permissible speed, then there is an altitude at which the air density will be what is needed to keep it aloft while flying at the angle of attack that minimizes the drag. The optimum altitude at maximum speed, and the optimum speed at maximum altitude, may change during the flight as the plane becomes lighter.) ...|$|E
