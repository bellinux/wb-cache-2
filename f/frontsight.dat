5000|$|... #Caption: Remington New Model Army Revolver, early {{model with}} {{mortised}} <b>frontsight</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{variant of}} the CQB, this {{features}} a removable <b>frontsight</b> {{in addition to the}} original [...] "Compact"'s features.|$|E
50|$|Features of {{the weapon}} include a {{chrome-plated}} trigger, slide release, and shell carrier. There is also an oversized triangular push-button safety. The trigger group is held in the receiver by two pins which makes removal for cleaning and maintenance very easy. Some models have a flip-up <b>frontsight</b> (which serves as a low-profile sight when closed) while others have a small blade sight. Other models were issued with ghost-ring sights.|$|E
5000|$|The flaw {{with the}} pepperbox {{is that it}} becomes more front-heavy if the length and number of barrels is increased, making {{accurate}} aiming difficult. With most types, in particular those with rotating barrel-clusters, {{it is almost impossible}} to aim beyond close range because the hammer is in the line of sight (some pepperboxes have a slot in the hammer through which one is supposed to aim), there is no place to put a <b>frontsight</b> (putting one for each barrel would only increase the weight of the front end and likely make drawing the weapon awkward), and the gun is too front-heavy to permit quick and steady aiming. However, the primary market was for civilian self-defense so its most common use was at close range. Common practice at the time, indeed, was not to aim pistols, but instead to [...] "shoot from the hip," [...] holding the gun low and simply pointing at the target's center of mass. Gunfights often happened at point-blank range. With this use in mind, many pepperboxes, in fact, have smooth-bored barrels, even though rifling had been commonly used for decades by the time of their manufacture. Bobbins & Lawrence models had rifled barrels.|$|E
