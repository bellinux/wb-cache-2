40|$|The present {{research}} deals with cultural and psycho-sociological reexamination of both {{structure and function}} of the collective behaviour, characterized by non-conventionalism and which are, in public opinion, evaluated negatively from the ethical perspective, giving birth to a <b>disappointing</b> feeling and a guilty attitude of the community. We propose the term of <b>disappointing</b> collective behaviour for efficiency and we have identified two major components: the problematic situation {{and the presence of}} an arbitrary constituted community, as well as the double proportion (real and imaginary) between them. We have presented two emblematical cases of <b>disappointing</b> collective behaviour: Deletha Word (Detroit, 1995) and Angel Arce Torres (Hartford, 2008) and we have investigated them from the procedure perspective, as well as their public perception. We have identified three types of <b>disappointing</b> sources in front of collective non-interventionist behaviour (cultural, psycho-cultural and social). We have also tried to find theoretically based and experimental explanations for mechanisms of producing <b>disappointing</b> collective behaviour, pointing out the benefits of these approaches that are based mostly on highlighting the presence of psychological processes (responsibility diffusion, pluralistic ignorance etc.), and also the existing limits in the nowadays research of these phenomena. The penultimate chapter is dedicated to analysis of three recent cases of <b>disappointing</b> collective behaviour, while the last chapter presents the research conclusion...|$|R
