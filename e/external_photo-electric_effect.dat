In spite of this, the observational situation remains very limited; the last instrument dedicated to X-ray polarimetry flew decades ago on OSO- 8, and the few recent measurements {{have been made by}} instruments optimized for other purposes. However, the technical capabilities to greatly advance the observational situation are in hand. Recent developments in micro-pattern gas detectors allow use of the polarization sensitivity of the <b>photo-electric</b> <b>effect,</b> which is the dominant interaction in the band above 2 keV. We present the scientific and technical requirements for an X-ray polarization observatory consistent with the scope of a NASA Small Explorer (SMEX) mission, along with a representative catalog of what the observational capabilities and expected sensitivities for the first year of operation could be.

40|$|From {{a formal}} and {{academic}} point of view, the Hounsfield number definition is only truly independent {{of energy for}} water and vacuum. The X-ray attenuation coefficients of other substances do not vary with energy {{in the same way}} as water and indeed they are often very different. Thus before even considering energy spectra and beam hardening effects, the definition is already ambiguous because the mono-energetic X-ray beam is undefined. Many papers have been published on the compensation of beam hardening and among those papers there is a subcategory that proposes some form of integration over the energy spectrum for practical X-ray sources. Usually, there is some mention of the “effective beam energy” 1 or mapping values to “some mono-chromatic energy”, 2 which in the case of Reference 2 is 70 keV. Thus, both academically and practically, there is a need for defining the conditions under which the Hounsfield number definition is valid. This requires not only the energy to be defined but also the attenuation coefficient. For the former, an alternative might be to define an energy spectrum, but this appears more difficult, at least at first sight. For the latter, it would mean specifying the attenuation coefficient for either scattering plus the <b>photo-electric</b> <b>effect</b> or for just the <b>photo-electric</b> <b>effect.</b> When measuring uniform samples for a standard, it would be possible to adapt the detector to include or exclude scattered photons to a high level of accuracy. Of course, the adoption of a rigorous definition would not cure all CT problems overnight, but it would create a firmer foundation and would open the way to publishing standard Hounsfield values for common materials. Communities other than the medical community working with CT scanners in different energy ranges may require definitions adapted to their particular needs, but the existence rather than the absence of standards can only be positive...|$|R

40|$|The {{relative}} ionisation efficiencies of alanine dosimeters and tooth enamel differ greatly between gamma and X-ray irradiations.

In contrast, the photon energies emitted from X-ray sources are usually much lower and energy is, at least in part, transferred to matter via the <b>photo-electric</b> <b>effect,</b> which has a cubic relationship between energy transfer and average Z -value of the absorber. The decomposition of the ESR spectra of an enamel fragment shows that the X-ray generated distribution of anisotropic View the MathML source radicals is virtually the same as in the natural sample, but quite different to gamma irradiated samples.

For circularly polarized states the soliton’s envelope is a circular ellipsoid whose length is the observed wavelength (λ), and whose diameter is λ/π; this envelope contains the electromagnetic energy of the wave (hν = hc/λ).

The central question of this MSc research project was to verify if the EUV power sensor signal can be purified by suppressing the out-of-bound secondary electron signal using an electrostatic barrier, and, if so, which potential difference suffices. To this end, we designed a Secondary Electron Energy Distribution (SEED) analyzer to characterize the e-beam-induced secondary electron emission of gold and carbon targets. It was shown that the SEED analyzer allows filtering of electrons on their kinetic energy and could perform SE yield measurements as well as SE energy distribution measurements. However, systematic errors occurred {{in the form of}} secondary electron emission of the grid inside the SEED analyzer, leakage current flow, a loss of emitted electrons through the SEED analyzer’s opening and deflection of electrons due to lack of a field-free region.
