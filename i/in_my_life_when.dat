I was made fun of with braces and kinky hair, and being from a multicultural family, etcetera... And it really hurts when you're that age, but later when you get something of your own or you get involved in activities like a sport, you begin to be accepted for what you do, and your personality and who you are, instead of your clothes and how you look and the name designer brands you have on.|$|E

500|$|Kaif's {{career as}} a model led to {{anticipation}} surrounding her Bollywood debut. Boom (2003) had its first screening at the Cannes Film Festival, and was heavily promoted at the event. Boom was a commercial and critical failure. Kaif's enactment of a supermodel ensnared in the Mumbai underworld was poorly received, with Ziya U. Salam of The Hindu attributing the weak performances of the film's leading ladies to [...] "the vacuity of their expressions". Hindustan Times reported that after Booms release, Kaif was written off due to her poor Hindi and thick British accent. She later dismissed the film: [...] "I don't count Boom among important happenings <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> <b>When</b> I signed this film, I didn't know much about India and its film audience". Although Kaif was offered a number of modelling assignments, filmmakers were hesitant to cast her because of her poor command of Hindi. In one instance, Mahesh Bhatt replaced her with Tara Sharma in Saaya (2003) as he found her an [...] "inconsistent performer". Subsequently, Kaif began working on her diction through Hindi classes.|$|E

2500|$|It was the Liberal Party that wooed Sauvé into politics, {{asking her}} to run as a {{candidate}} in the Montreal riding of Ahuntsic during the 1972 federal election. Though she found campaigning arduous, saying: [...] "I felt uneasy {{for the first time}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> <b>when</b> I was campaigning... I must say I had qualms about it myself", Sauvé won, becoming one of five female MPs. She was subsequently both sworn into the Queen's Privy Council and appointed as Minister of State for Science and Technology in the Cabinet chaired by Pierre Trudeau, thus becoming the first woman from Quebec to become a minister of the Crown and the sole female in that Cabinet. Sauvé ran again in the election two years later, re-winning Ahuntsic, and was given the environment portfolio until 1975, when she was appointed Minister of Communications.|$|E

2500|$|Sting was {{regarded}} by colleagues in WCW {{as a professional}} and well-respected locker room leader. Prominent adversary Big Van Vader felt that Sting had unsurpassed athletic prowess within the business, and [...] "ranks right up at the top" [...] as an in-ring performer.
