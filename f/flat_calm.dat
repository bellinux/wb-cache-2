He continued to date Kloepfer as well, though neither woman was aware of the other's existence. In the fall of 1973 Bundy matriculated at UPS Law School and continued courting Brooks, who flew to Seattle several times to stay with him. They discussed marriage; at one point he introduced her to Davis as his fiancée. In January 1974, however, he abruptly broke off all contact; her phone calls and letters went unreturned. Finally reaching him by phone a month later, Brooks demanded to know why Bundy had unilaterally ended their relationship without explanation. In a <b>flat,</b> <b>calm</b> voice, he replied, [...] "Stephanie, I have no idea what you mean" [...] and hung up. She never heard from him again. [...] He later explained, [...] "I just wanted to prove to myself that I could have married her"; but Brooks concluded in retrospect that he had deliberately planned the entire courtship and rejection in advance as vengeance for the breakup she initiated in 1968.|$|E

That Woodhouse, as a very condition of its own being, hated any approach to originality or real taste, this James Houghton could never learn.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{atmospheric}} and meteorological parameters for the control of blasting dust. Dust generated due to blasting at large surface coal mines causes air pollution in and around the mining area. The dispersion of blasting dust depends on prevailing atmospheric and meteorological conditions. A Sound Detection and Ranging (SODAR) was installed at the mine site to monitor atmospheric conditions in four seasons. Over 2000 sodar echograms were examined and classified into six categories as rising layers, thermal plume (free), ground based layer (spiky top), spiky top layer (clear weather), <b>flat</b> top layer (<b>calm</b> cold), and ground based stratified and multiple layers. Dot echo structures in the echograms were also observed during rainfall. From sodar echograms, unstable and stable periods were identified. Pasquill stability classes were evaluated by echograms and mixing heights. An automatic weather station was also installed at the site to monitor meteorological parameters as wind speed, wind direction, temperature, humidity, solar radiation and rainfall. Simple correlations as well as multiple regression analysis of meteorological parameters with mixing height show that solar radiation has strong influence on mixing height. The nearby villages that are likely to be affected by blasting dust can be protected by planting trees perpendicular to the wind direction as indicated by windrose diagrams. Dispersion factors, the product of mixing height and wind speed, were calculated for all the seasons. It was suggested that blasting should be conducted during the period when the dispersion factor is maximum so that the impacts of blasting dust on the environment can be minimised...|$|R

40|$|This {{thesis is}} devoted to the {{investigation}} of the impacts of fast moving ocean surface waves on the aerodynamics of offshore wind turbines. The impacts of non-locally generated waves (swell) on the Marine Atmospheric BoundaryLayer (MABL) and thereby on offshore wind turbine aerodynamics are studied numerically by using Large Eddy Simulations and the Actuator Line Method. The MABL is often interacting with ocean surface waves causing mass, heat and momentum exchange between the air and the underlying waves’ surface. Due to this coupling between the MABL and the surface waves, the MABL differs from boundary layer over land. The effects of ocean waves on the MABL are believed to be small and usually taken into account as a roughness height when offshore wind farms are designed. This roughness height is commonlytreated either as a constant or {{as a function of the}} friction velocity without regard to its dependency on the sea state (i. e. the waves’ height, slope and velocity). However, recent field observations and numerical simulations have shown that the impact of the waves, in particularly swell, on the MABL might be stronger than previously assumed. Wave statistics show that the earth’s oceans are strongly dominated by swell waves almost all the time. Hence, abetter understanding of swell effects on the MABL would provide a valuable information that can lead to improve: the offshore wind turbine design, the layout of offshore wind farms and the accuracy of wind farm power extractionrate estimations. The results presented in this thesis show that the swell impacts on the MABL are significant. By comparing the MABL over moving waves to that over <b>flat</b> surface (<b>calm</b> sea), the effects of swell are isolated from the effects of atmospheric turbulence. The wave-induced stress reduces the total wind stress resulting in higher wind velocity, less wind shear and lower turbulence intensity level. These effects increase by increasing the wave age and/or wave steepness. These modifications in the MABL in the presence of fast moving swells propagating in the direction of the local wind invalidate the use of the Monin–Obukhov Similarity Theory widely used in wind energy applications and indicate that the extrapolation of a wind speed measured at a certain height to another height assuming a logarithmic wind speed profile is questionable in the presence of swell. Moreover, the results show that fast moving waves have pronounced effects on wind turbine aerodynamics. Longer wind turbine wake regions and weaker velocity deficits downstream a stand-alone wind turbine with higher power extraction rates are obtained in the presence of swell. More remarkably, higher overall power extraction rates are obtained from a 2 by 2 wind farm in the presence of swell for the same hub-height wind velocity...|$|R

If you are the author or principal advisor of this work and would like to request open access for it, please contact us at open-help@bu. edu. Thank you. This thesis investigates the processes governing the hydro-morphodynamics of shallow coastal bays, through field investigations and numerical modeling. Particular attention is devoted to understand the coupling between three morphological units: salt marshes, tidal flats and tidal channels. This study demonstrates that sea level rise and sediment supply have a significant and complex control on the morphological evolution of coastal bays. Erosive processes in the lagoons ofVirginia Coast Reserve (VA) are explored through a detailed model for tidal currents and the dynamics of wind waves. The model reveals that both wave-induced erosion of the marsh boundary and tidal flat bed erosion increase with sea level rise. Both positive and negative feedbacks between wave energy at the boundaries and bottom shear stresses are predicted, depending on the fate of the sediments eroded from the salt marsh boundaries. A lD morphological model for the coupled evolution of marshes and tidal flats shows that both an increase in sea level and a decrease in sediment supply enhance marsh boundary erosion, suggesting that this erosion mechanism is a leading cause of marsh deterioration. In addtion, the model predicts that the scarp between salt marsh and tidal flat is a distinctive feature of marsh retreat, suggesting the use of this geometry as an indicator for ongoing erosion. Field investigations in Willapa Bay (WA) shed light on the transport of water and sediments in a channel-tidal <b>flat</b> complex. During <b>calm</b> weather suspended sediment concentration is higher in the channel than on the tidal flat, leading to a sediment flux toward the latter, while the opposite flux occurs during stormy weather. A "two-points" dynamical model shows that the morphology of a costal bay stems from a dynamical equilibrium between currents in the channels and wind waves on the tidal flats. Because multiple equilibria are present, abrupt morphological changes can be triggered by small changes in wind regime, sea level or sediment supply...|$|R
