40|$|International audienceHybrid cloud {{bursting}} (i. e., leasing temporary off-premise cloud {{resources to}} boost the overall capacity during peak utilization) is a popular and cost-effective {{way to deal with}} the increasing complexity of big data analytics. It is particularly promising for iterative MapReduce applications that reuse massive amounts of input data at each iteration, which compensates for the high overhead and cost of concurrent data transfers from the on-premise to the off-premise VMs over a weak <b>inter-site</b> <b>link</b> that is of limited capacity. In this paper we study how to combine various MapReduce data locality techniques designed for hybrid cloud bursting in order to achieve scalability for iterative MapReduce applications in a cost-effective fashion. This is a non-trivial problem due to the complex interaction between the data movements over the weak link and the scheduling of computational tasks that have to adapt to the shifting data distribution. We show that using the right combination of techniques, iterative MapReduce applications can scale well in a hybrid cloud bursting scenario and come even close to the scalability observed in single sites...|$|E
50|$|The Virtual Layer-3 Switch {{is useful}} to make a {{large-scale}} site-to-site VPN network. Although the easy {{way to make a}} site-to-site VPN network is to build the layer-2 bridging based VPN, if the number of computers is huge the number of broadcasting packets will increase to load the <b>inter-site</b> <b>links.</b> To prevent that scaling problem, the VPN administrator isolates IP networks by Virtual Layer-3 switch.|$|R
40|$|The {{possibility}} of using radio over fiber (RoF) analog transmissions {{to characterize the}} wireless propagation channel of distributed antenna systems is investigated. In particular, the coherence time of kilometer-long, fiber-based networks is analyzed. Joint measurements of the phase noise of parallel links to the same site (intra-site) and to different sites (inter-site) in such a network are presented. The coherence time of the phase noise and phase noise difference between links is evaluated {{by means of the}} Allan time deviation. Measurements are performed at a frequency of 2. 3 GHz under both stationary and non-stationary temperature conditions, for a duration of ten hours. In the setup analyzed, the phase noise was found to be white, with a phase drift component that determines the coherence time of the link. Coherence times between two to six minutes have been measured for a phase offset of 10 degrees Celcius. Values of the correlation coefficient r for intra-site phase noise processes higher than 0. 99 have been measured, while correlation coefficients for <b>inter-site</b> <b>links</b> exhibit lower values, r > 0. 87. All phase noise processes display a strong, negative correlation with the local environment temperature, with r <- 0. 75 and temperature drift coefficients in the range of - 20 $ degrees to - 30 degrees per Celcius degree. On the other hand, phase noise difference between links showed weak correlation with temperature, where coherence times were in the order of 15 minutes for <b>inter-site</b> <b>links</b> and 60 minutes for intra-site links. Moreover, it was found that hardware imbalances between links, as well as temperature gradients of several Celcius degrees per hour can considerably reduce coherence times. The results of this investigation suggest that, when parallel fiber optic links are used, the phase coherence of the measurement system might prevent the double-directional characterization of the wireless propagation channel, unless care is taken to minimize variations in the (distributed) temperature environment. Alternatively, phase offsets can be measured several times per hour...|$|R
40|$|Link {{analysis}} {{has been widely}} {{used to evaluate the}} im-portance of web pages. PageRank, the most famous link analysis algorithm, offers an effective way to rank the pages. However, the algorithm ignores three facts. First, nowadays the way that users retrieve information {{is quite different from the}} previous way when web search engine was not extensively used. Second, <b>inter-site</b> <b>links</b> and intra-site links should not be treated equally. A link from a different site is more important for a page than that within the same site. Third, most users start their browsing from a home-page, which should be given more weight than other pages. In this paper, we propose a novel ranking algorithm called XRank as a solution to these problems. Experimental results on the CWT 100 g show that our XRank algorithm outper-forms other famous ranking algorithms, including PageR-ank and Two-Layer PageRank, especially on sites recom-mendation and web spam avoidance. ...|$|R
40|$|Optical and {{microwave}} engineers {{ask for the}} required data rates when developing fourth generation (4 G) mobile backhaul solutions. Backhauling emerges into an important question since advanced interference mitigation techniques are used to improve the performance {{at the cost of}} higher backhaul traffic. In this paper, we provide an efficient method for estimating the backhaul traffic when using joint transmission (JT) coordinated multi-point (CoMP). With this technique, a cluster of base stations (BSs) performs joint signal processing to cancel the mutual interference between adjacent cells. The information exchange between the BSs depends on the cluster size that can be very dynamic depending on the actual interference situation at the mobile terminal. We observe that, on average, 2 / 3 of the exchange requires <b>inter-site</b> <b>links.</b> This simplifies the analysis and we can refer to the cluster size distribution to compute the backhaul traffic. Results depend on a threshold in the mobility management and on the antenna down-tilt. During busy hours, operators can serve up to 1. 3 Gb/s per cell in 50 MHz bandwidth. Backhaul traffic for JT CoMP can reach 5 and 20 Gb/s per triple-sector site for up- and downstream, respectively...|$|R
