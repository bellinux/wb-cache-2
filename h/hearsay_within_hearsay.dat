Japan receives a large amount of funding for neutrino activities, such as the T2K experiment, a factor not in its favor, although 20 huge caverns with access tunnels have already been constructed in Japan for hydroelectric power plants (e.g. the Kannagawa Hydropower Plant). Following the closure of the Tevatron some groups within the USA had expressed interest, with Fermilab being a favored site because of the facilities and manpower already present. Much of the speculated interest from other countries was <b>hearsay</b> from <b>within</b> the scientific community, and very few facts were published officially.

40|$|Crawford v. Washington {{should not}} have been surprising. The Confrontation Clause {{guarantees}} a criminal defendant the right 2 ̆ 2 to be confronted with the witnesses against him. 2 ̆ 2 The doctrine of Ohio v. Roberts, treating the clause as a general proscription against the admission of hearsay-except <b>hearsay</b> that fits <b>within</b> a 2 ̆ 2 firmly rooted 2 ̆ 2 exception or is otherwise deemed reliable-had so {{little to do with the}} constitutional text, or with the history or principle behind it, that eventually it was bound to be discarded. And the appeal of a testimonial approach to the clause seemed sufficiently strong to yield high hopes that ultimately the Supreme Court would adopt it. After all, on its face the clause establishes a categorical, unqualified right to be confronted with the adverse 2 ̆ 2 witnesses, 2 ̆ 2 and witnesses are those who give testimony. Plainly, the clause was meant to ensure that prosecution witnesses give their testimony face to face with the accused...|$|R
40|$|A three-year-old child, {{while being}} bathed by her babysitter, innocently {{mentions}} that her “pee-pee” hurts. When the babysitter asks the child how she hurt it, she says, “Uncle Ernie (her mother’s boyfriend) {{told me not}} to tell. ” A subsequent medical examination reveals that the child has gonorrhea, a sexually transmitted disease. By the time of trial, the child is four and-a-half-years old. When questioned by the trial judge, she cannot explain to the judge’s satisfaction, “the difference between the truth and a lie. ” Moreover, she has no long term memory of the incident. The judge rules the child incompetent to testify. Can the child have made a reliable statement {{a year and a half}} before? Should the babysitter’s testimony be admitted, if it otherwise falls <b>within</b> a <b>hearsay</b> exception? If the statement is nontestimonial under Crawford v. Washington and its progeny the due process clause governs, rather than the confirmation clause. The author’s thesis is that ruling on the admissibility of the child’s out-of-court statement should be informed by social science research in the field of developmental psychology. That research has shown that young children’s statements regarding recent events may be just as, or even more, reliable than adult’s observations and recollections. She proposes that if a child of the declarant’s age could have made a reliable statement of the type offered it ought to be admitted, and attacks on the child’s credibility should go to the weight of the evidence. Even if the child is found competent and permitted to testify at trial, a young child’s testimony may be either not forthcoming (like that of an adult domestic violence victim) or simply ineffective due to the child’s being confused by complex questions inappropriate to her age. The confrontation clause will not bar even testimonial hearsay statements when a child testifies at trial. The author argues that, in this situation, too, hearsay that passes the due process test should be admitted. Additionally, she argues that the judge ought to employ Evidence Rule 611 (a) to preclude developmentally inappropriate questioning of young witnesses...|$|R
40|$|Distinguished jurist and scholar, Judge Richard Posner of the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit penned a {{concurrence}} in United States v. Boyce, 742 F. 3 d 792 (7 th Cir. 2014), {{in which}} he launched a scathing attack on the scheme of categorical hearsay exceptions embodied in the Federal Rules of Evidence. After characterizing the existing hearsay regime as bad “folk psychology,” Judge Posner called for the repeal of categorical hearsay exceptions in favor of case-by-case determinations about the “reliability” of particular hearsay statements by trial judges. Prior to adoption of the Federal Rules, evidence experts debated whether a case-by-case or categorical approach to hearsay exceptions was superior. Judge Posner’s concurrence in Boyce resurrects that debate. Recent evidence scholarship highlights differences of opinion regarding the operation and propriety of specific <b>hearsay</b> exceptions <b>within</b> the Federal Rules of Evidence. Not until the gateway question raised in Boyce about the proper structure of the hearsay regime is resolved may the debate proceed concerning which hearsay exceptions belong in a categorical regime fit to serve the twenty-first century. This Article explores Judge Posner’s proposal through an economic lens, specifically highlighting {{the costs and benefits}} of the purely discretionary approach he proposes. On the cost side of the ledger, the article points out the decrease in predictability that a case-by-case reliability approach to hearsay would create and examines the litigation consequences of such decreased information flow. This Article also cautions against the damage to consistency and fairness certain to follow case-by-case consideration of all hearsay. Further, this Article highlights the scant benefits of a discretionary approach to hearsay. The Article concludes that Judge Posner’s proposal represents a bad bargain for the law of evidence and suggests that efforts to reform the hearsay regime would be more effectively focused on modifying existing categorical exceptions or in pursuing a truly new paradigm for hearsay evidence that eliminates amorphous considerations of “reliability” altogether. Thus, the Article urges the rejection of the purely discretionary model for evaluating hearsay evidence once and for all and seeks to stimulate thought about hearsay reforms that move evidence law forward...|$|R
40|$|The new Illinois Rules of Evidence (IRE), {{which took}} effect January 1, 2011, {{primarily}} reaffirm earlier laws dispersed throughout cases, statutes and rules. They modernize many evidence guidelines by incorporating “uncontroversial developments” {{found in the}} Federal Rules of Evidence (FRE) and in the laws of forty-four other surveyed jurisdictions. The new rules are said to change Illinois evidence laws in only two areas: they add opinion testimony {{as a method of}} proving character and they eliminate certain requirements <b>within</b> the <b>hearsay</b> exceptions on statements of then existing mental, emotional or physical condition. The new rules reference some, but far from all, preexisting statutes whose validity “are not affected by” the IRE. The rules contemplate future General Assembly laws on evidence {{as long as there is}} no conflict with the IRE. Finally, when there is redundancy between IRE and another Illinois Supreme Court Rule, “reference should be made solely to the appropriate Illinois rule of evidence. ” Other American states have also codified their evidence laws on the FRE model and, accordingly, both federal and other state experiences should be helpful to Illinois lawyers and judges. There are a few pitfalls, however. First, the legislative history behind the FRE is dispersed so that its persuasive use in Illinois courts will be challenging. Second, the role of the General Assembly in promulgating new evidence laws is uncertain. Uncertainty arises, in part, because evidence guidelines often implicate substantive law policies, thus prompting General Assembly responsibilities. Perhaps at least some evidence lawmaking in Illinois should be undertaken jointly by legislators and judges. Third, not all IRE provisions are modeled on FRE provisions so that care is required when utilizing federal precedents. IRE diversions from the FRE are sometimes expressly referenced in the notes accompanying the IRE. At other times, open issues of Illinois evidence law are recognized; here there may be diversions from the FRE. Fourth, even when the IRE and FRE appear similar, at times they will (and should) be read differently. Fifth, there may be more choice of law issues when applying the IRE rather than the FRE. Finally, there are some major questions left unaddressed in the IRE and little guidance from the rule makers and others on who will answer, when answers will come and what the answers will likely be...|$|R
40|$|The Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution {{guarantees}} {{a criminal}} defendant the right 2 ̆ 2 {{to be confronted}} with the witnesses against him. 2 ̆ 2 Four years ago, in Crawford v. Washington, the United States Supreme Court held that this right bars the admission of testimonial hearsay statements against criminal defendants, {{regardless of whether or}} not the statements fall <b>within</b> an evidentiary <b>hearsay</b> exception. It was a decision that other courts later described as a 2 ̆ 2 bombshell, 2 ̆ 2 a 2 ̆ 2 renaissance, 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 a newly shaped lens 2 ̆ 2 through which to view the Confrontation Clause. The case generated an extensive amount of discussion among legal commentators. Since its decision in Crawford, the Court has had to grapple regularly with questions that Crawford left unanswered. This term, the Court is poised to determine yet another unanswered Crawford question in Melendez-Diaz v. Massachusetts: 2 ̆ 2 [w]hether a state forensic analyst 2 ̆ 7 s laboratory report prepared for use in a criminal prosecution is 2 ̆ 7 testimonial 2 ̆ 7 evidence subject to the demands of the Confrontation Clause as set forth in Crawford v. Washington, 541 U. S. 36 (2004). 2 ̆ 2 The outcome in Melendez-Diaz will have a significant impact on America 2 ̆ 7 s criminal justice system in general. Moreover, the case could raise important implications in capital sentencing proceedings. Parts I and II of this comment provide a brief overview of Crawford and its progeny.

40|$|In this Essay, Professor Friedman places Giles v. California in {{the context}} of the recent {{transformation}} of the law governing the Confrontation Clause of the Sixth Amendment. He contends that a robust doctrine of forfeiture is an integral part of a sound conception of the confrontation right. One reason this is so is that cases fitting <b>within</b> the traditional <b>hearsay</b> exception for dying declarations can be explained as instances of forfeiture. This explanation leads to a simple structure of confrontation law, qualified by the principle that the confrontation right may be waived or forfeited but not subject to genuine exceptions. But this view of forfeiture now appears to be foreclosed by the decision in Giles that the accused does not forfeit the right unless his conduct was designed to render the victim unavailable as a witness. One justification offered for the result in Giles is the near circularity of holding that the accused forfeited the confrontation right on the basis of the same misconduct with which he is charged. This coincidence of issues should not be regarded as a genuine problem-any more than when, in a conspiracy prosecution, the judge admits a statement on the ground that it was made by a conspirator of the accused. Another justification offered by the majority was equity-an unpersuasive ground when the reason the accused cannot examine the witness is that he murdered her, albeit for some reason other than preventing her testimony at trial. And finally, the majority contends that the imminence requirement of the dying declaration exception would have been without force ifforfeiture doctrine had been broad enough to apply to cases of statements by victims who did not appear to be on the verge of death at the time. Professor Friedman contends that the imminence requirement can be understood as marking the boundary of cases in which the prosecution has a duty of mitigation-that is, a duty to try to preserve so much of the confrontation right as reasonably possible given the situation created by the accused 2 ̆ 7 s misconduct. He also argues that over the long term the decision in Giles may turn out to weaken the Confrontation Clause-by encouraging manipulation of existing doctrine, by discouraging adoption of a doctrine of mitigation, and by complicating the structure of the confrontation right...|$|R
