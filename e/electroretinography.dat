25|$|Achromatopsia {{has also}} been called rod monochromacy and total {{congenital}} color blindness.

25|$|The hemeralopic {{aspect of}} ACHM can be {{diagnosed}} non-invasively using <b>electroretinography.</b> The response at low (scotopic) and median (mesotopic) light levels will be normal but the response under high light level (photopic) conditions will be absent.

25|$|Up to 150 {{mutations}} {{have been}} reported to date in the opsin gene associated with the RP since the Pro23His mutation in the intradiscal domain of the protein was first reported in 1990. These mutations are found throughout the opsin gene and are distributed along the three domains of the protein (the intradiscal, transmembrane, and cytoplasmic domains). One of the main biochemical causes of RP in the case of rhodopsin mutations is protein misfolding, and the disruption of molecular chaperones. It was found that the mutation of codon 23 in the rhodopsin gene, in which proline is changed to histidine, accounts for the largest fraction of rhodopsin mutations in the United States. Several other studies have reported various codon mutations associated with Retinitis Pigmentosa, including Thr58Arg, Pro347Leu, Pro347Ser, as well as deletion of Ile-255. In 2000, a rare mutation in codon 23 was reported causing autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa, in which proline changed to alanine. However, this study showed that the retinal dystrophy associated with this mutation was characteristically mild in presentation and course. Furthermore, there was greater preservation in <b>electroretinography</b> amplitudes than the more prevalent Pro23His mutation.|$|E

2500|$|Congenital {{stationary}} {{night blindness}} is an ophthalmologic disorder in horses which is present at birth (congenital), non-progressive (stationary) and affects the animal's vision in conditions of low lighting. Horses with CSNB may be hesitant to enter dimly-lit places - such as indoor arenas, dark stalls, or trailers - and be apprehensive when in such conditions, which {{may interfere with}} handling or riding. CSNB is usually diagnosed based on the owner's observations, but some horses have visibly abnormal eyes: poorly aligned eyes (dorsomedial strabismus) or involuntary eye movement (nystagmus). The condition can be confirmed using <b>electroretinography,</b> from which a [...] "negative ERG" [...] indicates CSNB. While the retina is a normal shape, the nerve signal triggered when light reaches rod cells does not reach the brain.

50|$|Knobloch {{syndrome}} {{is a rare}} genetic disorder presenting severe eyesight problems and often a defect in the skull. A usual occurrence is a degeneration of the vitreous humour and the retina, two components of the eye. This breakdown often results in {{the separation of the}} retina (the light-sensitive tissue {{at the back of the}} eye) from the eye, called retinal detachment, which can be recurrent. Extreme myopia (near-sightedness) is a common feature. The limited evidence available from <b>electroretinography</b> suggests a cone-rod pattern of dysfunction is also a feature.|$|E

5000|$|Examination with an {{ophthalmoscope}} will initially show no changes, {{but in a}} {{few months}} atrophy of the retina will resemble the appearance of progressive retinal atrophy. Pathologically, there is a loss of the rod and cone cells followed by degeneration of other layers of the retina. The retinal degeneration appears to be related to apoptosis of these cells. [...] SARDS must be distinguished from other causes of sudden blindness that have no visible pathology, including retrobulbar optic neuritis, a tumor at the optic chiasm, or other central nervous system diseases. <b>Electroretinography</b> is useful to definitively diagnose SARDS.|$|E
50|$|Immunosuppressive {{drugs such}} as the {{therapeutic}} monoclonal antibody daclizumab, ciclosporin and methotrexate {{have proven to be}} effective treatment options for birdshot chorioretinopathy. Substantial reduction and even stabilization of both vitreous inflammation and retinal vasculitis have been evident via <b>electroretinography,</b> during daclizumab (IL-2 receptor blocker) therapy. This is also supported by the observation of elevated levels of IL-2 in the eyes of patients. Loss of visual acuity unrelated to the inflammation caused by the disorder, however, often remains unchanged despite usage of the drug. This is reflected by the lack of difference in visual acuity and the vision-related quality of life among various treatment categories in birdshot patients. Contraindications and adverse side-effects are always a factor, as well.|$|E
50|$|Progressive {{vision loss}} in any {{dog in the}} absence of canine {{glaucoma}} or cataracts can be an indication of PRA. It usually starts with decreased vision at night, or nyctalopia. Other symptoms include dilated pupils and decreased pupillary light reflex. Fundoscopy to examine the retina will show shrinking of the blood vessels, decreased pigmentation of the nontapetal fundus, increased reflection from the tapetum due to thinning of the retina, and later in the disease a darkened, atrophied optic disc. Secondary cataract formation in the posterior portion of the lens can occur late in the disease. In these cases diagnosis of PRA may require <b>electroretinography</b> (ERG). For many breeds there are specific genetic tests of blood or buccal mucosa for PRA.|$|E
50|$|A study {{examined}} the effects of TUDCA on cones, in relation to retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a disease in which retinal rods and cones undergo apoptosis. Mice models were used, a wild-type and a mutant RP model, rd10. Both models were injected with TUDCA every 3 days from post-natal day 6 (p6) to p30 and compared to the vehicle. <b>Electroretinography</b> (ERG), photoreceptor cell counts, cone photoreceptor nuclei counts, and TUNEL labeling were all analyzed to show the effects of TUDCA. The dark-adapted and light-adapted ERG responses were greater in the TUDCA treated mouse than the vehicle treated mouse. TUDCA treated mice also had more photoreceptor counts, yet non-altered retinal morphology or function. Even at P30, a stage where rod and cone function is usually greatly diminished in the rd10 mouse model, the photoreceptor function was protected.|$|E
50|$|Because of {{the wide}} {{spectrum}} of fundus changes and the difficulty in making the diagnosis in the early stages, <b>electroretinography</b> (ERG) remains the best test for making the diagnosis. Abnormal cone function on the ERG is indicated by a reduced single-flash and flicker response when the test is carried out in a well-lit room (photopic ERG). The relative sparing of rod function in cone dystrophy is evidenced by a normal scotopic ERG, i.e. when the test is {{carried out in the}} dark. In more severe or longer standing cases, the dystrophy involves a greater proportion of rods with resultant subnormal scotopic records. Since cone dystrophy is hereditary and can be asymptomatic early on in the disease process, ERG is an invaluable tool in the early diagnosis of patients with positive family histories.|$|E

50|$|<b>Electroretinography</b> {{measures}} the electrical responses of various cell {{types in the}} retina, including the photoreceptors (rods and cones), inner retinal cells (bipolar and amacrine cells), and the ganglion cells. Electrodes (DTL silver/nylon fiber string) are usually placed {{on the surface of}} the cornea for Full Field/Global/Multifocal ERG's and brass/copper electrodes are placed on the skin near the eye for EOG type testing. During a recording, the patient's eyes are exposed to standardized stimuli and the resulting signal is displayed showing the time course of the signal's amplitude (voltage). Signals are very small, and typically are measured in microvolts or nanovolts. The ERG is composed of electrical potentials contributed by different cell types within the retina, and the stimulus conditions (flash or pattern stimulus, whether a background light is present, and the colors of the stimulus and background) can elicit stronger response from certain components.|$|E
50|$|The unique {{architecture}} of the retina and its relatively immune-privileged environment help this process. Tight junctions that form the blood retinal barrier separate the subretinal space from the blood supply, thus protecting it from microbes and most immune-mediated damage, and enhancing its potential to respond to vector-mediated therapies. The highly compartmentalized anatomy of the eye facilitates accurate delivery of therapeutic vector suspensions to specific tissues under direct visualization using microsurgical techniques. In the sheltered environment of the retina, AAV vectors are able to maintain high levels of transgene expression in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), photoreceptors, or ganglion cells {{for long periods of}} time after a single treatment. In addition, the eye and the visual system can be routinely and easily monitored for visual function and retinal structural changes after injections with noninvasive advanced technology, such as visual acuities, contrast sensitivity, fundus auto-fluorescence (FAF), dark-adapted visual thresholds, vascular diameters, pupillometry, <b>electroretinography</b> (ERG), multifocal ERG and optical coherence tomography (OCT).|$|E
50|$|The journal {{was founded}} as the {{official}} publication of the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms.

The original Associate Editors were Gene Block, Serge Daan, Jerry Feldman, Bruce Goldman, Mike Menaker, Bob Moore, and Terry Page. The first issue largely focused on zoology and physiology, {{but over the years}} the field of discussion has expanded to include neurobiology, cell and molecular biology, photobiology, computational biology, behavioral ecology, and translational medicine. Early experiments focused on Syrian and Siberian hamsters, ground squirrels, and bubble snails. Since those first publications, experimental subjects represented in the journal have grown to be more diverse, as well as the techniques used to research them. The techniques mentioned in the first few publications involved behavioral and physiological monitoring, circumscribed brain lesions, melatonin radioimmunoassays, <b>electroretinography,</b> and electrophysiological recordings. Early research topics included “splitting,” circannual rhythmicity, photoperiodic time measurement, and circadian pacemaker development, coupling, and output.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess the {{alteration}} of retinal function by multifocal <b>electroretinography</b> and full-field <b>electroretinography</b> in patients with age-related macular degeneration treated with bevacizumab. Methods: We performed a prospective pilot study of 26 eyes of 26 previously treatment-naive patients with neovascular age-related macular degeneration receiving intravitreal injections with 1. 25 mg bevacizumab. Patients were examined with multifocal <b>electroretinography,</b> full-field <b>electroretinography,</b> optical coherence tomography, and visual acuity. Follow-up was performed at 1 week, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. Results: Mean multifocal <b>electroretinography</b> P 1 amplitudes were significantly improved at 1 week in the central zone and after 3 and 6 months, improvement was seen in all 6 concentric rings corresponding to +/- 25 degrees of the central visual field. Full-field <b>electroretinography</b> results indicated a decrease in cone photoreceptor function at 3 months, which was normalized at 6 months compared with baseline. Furthermore, 2 of 3 of the combined rod-cone responses showed signs of decreased retinal function at 6 months. Conclusion: Our results indicate passing signs of an altered retinal cone photoreceptor function assessed by full-field <b>electroretinography.</b> The results do not show any conclusive signs of global retinal toxicity after 6 months.
