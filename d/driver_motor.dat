2500|$|Galileo high-gain antenna {{failed to}} fully deploy after its first flyby of Earth. The antenna had 18 ribs, like an {{umbrella}} {{and when the}} <b>driver</b> <b>motor</b> started and {{put pressure on the}} ribs, they were supposed to pop out of the cup their tips were held in. Only 15 popped out, leaving the antenna looking like a lop-sided, half-open umbrella. Investigators concluded that during the 4.5 years that Galileo spent in storage after the 1986 Challenger disaster, the lubricants between the tips of the ribs and the cup were eroded and worn away from vibration during three cross-country journeys by truck between California and Florida for the spacecraft. The failed ribs were those closest to the flat-bed trailers carrying Galileo on these trips, which were used instead of air transport to cut costs. [...] The antenna lubricants were not checked or replaced before launch.|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to examine {{intergroup}} bias among people who use roads in Jakarta. Intergroup bias refers to the tendency to prioritize, treat and perceive in-group members more favorable than out-groups. Three different groups of road users participated in this study: private <b>drivers,</b> <b>motor</b> riders, and public transportation drivers. Intergroup bias is measured as perception bias and attribution bias. The findings show that both forms of bias occur among the road users. Intergroup attribution bias that is found among the three groups are more in-group than out-group attribution bias. The private car <b>drivers,</b> <b>motor</b> riders, and public transportation drivers tend to attribute positive behavior of in-group to internal factor and negative behavior of in-group to external factors. Index of effect size in perception bias indicates substantive levels and represents large effect in the population.

On 20 December 1966, Fuchs was found guilty of being an accessory to the mass murder of at least 79,000 Jews and sentenced to four years imprisonment. Fuchs was married for the sixth time during the trial. Fuchs died on July 25, 1980 at the age of 78.|$|E

In that case, a 1986 segment on CBS News' 60 Minutes accused the Audi 5000 sedan of unintended acceleration defects, which was followed by numerous reports of tragic accidents and media expert commentary. At the time, Audi was reported to have the highest rate of acceleration complaints. However, the NHTSA later determined all complaints to be due to driver error.|$|E

[...] Murdoch sold the magazine profitably in 1991 to K-III Publications, which became Primedia - which was later sold to Source Interlink Media, the current owner of the magazine. When Automobile was acquired by K-III, Davis also became the editorial director of the company's Motor Trend magazine. Automobile celebrated its 25th anniversary in 2011.|$|E
50|$|During {{the height}} of the recall crisis, Toyota came in for {{extensive}} editorial criticism, with commentators including CounterPunch suggesting that emphasis on profits had resulted in manufacturing defects. Editorials criticizing alleged disproportionate coverage of the recalls ran in Automotive News, AutoWeek, BusinessWeek, Car and <b>Driver,</b> <b>Motor</b> Trend, Popular Mechanics, and the National Post. Such editorials commonly faulted media outlets for leaving out alternative explanations such as driver inattentiveness, driver skills, DUI, being on the cellphone, erroneous perceptions, reckless driving, or texting as causes of accidents. In one cited example, the Los Angeles Times did not mention that an alleged Toyota runaway driver was indicted for vehicular manslaughter and driving under the influence of marijuana.|$|E

50|$|Cruising in Detroit {{took place}} from the 1950s to the 1970s in the city's {{northern}} suburbs along M-1 (Woodward Avenue), from Ferndale north to Pontiac.

The cruising culture on Woodward Avenue faded in the 1970s when new car safety standards and higher gas prices altered American automotive design. Other popular cruising strips in the Detroit area include US 24 (Telegraph Road) from 12 Mile Road in Southfield to Michigan Avenue in Dearborn, and M-3 (Gratiot Avenue) on the East Side. The Woodward Dream Cruise occurs on the third Saturday in August along the original cruising strip in Detroit's northern suburbs.

40|$|Structure of a Switched Reluctance Motor (SRM) has double salient {{poles and}} does not include {{permanent}} magnet, conductor and bar. Therefore, this geometrical structure {{is intended to be}} used as an advantage for the screw pump proposal; magnetic rotor has been designed partially, inspired from the structure of radial and axial flux SRM. Proposed SRM has 6 / 4 poles and 3 phase configuration. Screw rotor, which is made of non-magnetic material, has been installed between magnetic rotor and the rotor structure of the screw pump has been obtained. In stator, there are 4 coils of 2000 turns installed in flux path for each phase. The screw rotor isn't included in the magnetic coupling. Here the pump rotor itself is an actuator of direct drive application. This system has been called as SP-SRM. Electrical and magnetic quantities like inductance, torque, power, magnetic flux of the SPSRM have been calculated analytically and predicted by finite elements method (Ansoft Maxwell 3 D); it doesn't cover mechanics and dynamics of the proposed system.
