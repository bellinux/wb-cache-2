Chatter vibrations can be avoided using stability diagrams for which tool point frequency response function (FRF) must be determined accurately.

In this study, spindle bearing dynamics are identified for various spindle rotational speeds and cutting forces. Then, for a real machining center, tool point FRFs under operating conditions are determined using the identified speed dependent bearing dynamics and the mathematical model proposed.

The <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>moment</b> then tends to rotate the aircraft about an axis perpendicular to those of the two angular speeds and, in the came of airscrews with three or more blades, is constant during a revolution of the airscrew. With two-bladed airscrews, on the contrary, although the calculate <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>moment</b> represents the mean value in time, it fluctuates about this value with a frequency equal to twice the revolutions per minute. In addition, pulsating moments likewise occur about the other two axes. This fact is known from the theory of the asymmetrical gyro; the calculations that have been carried out for the determination of the various gyroscopic moments, however, mostly require an exact knowledge of the gyro theory. The problem will therefore be approached in another manner based on quite elementary considerations.

Compared to conventional spindles, and motorized spindles are equipped with built-in motors for better power transmission and balance to achieve high-speed operation. However, the built-in motor introduces additional mass to the spindle shaft, besides, since its very high working speed, some high-speed rotational effects, including centrifugal forces and <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>moments</b> on the spindle shaft can not be neglected in the analysis as is done in conventional spindle, thus complicating its mechanical-dynamic behaviors.

In this paper, aiming at improving the operation stability, dynamic {{performance of}} SBS operating in high-speed field is investigated based on a finite element (FE) dynamic model. Firstly, the Timoshenko beam elements are applied to develop the SBS FE model with full consideration of HSE. Secondly, idle state frequency response function at the front tip is obtained analytically and experimentally to validate that the FE model can illustrate the system dynamic behaviors in static condition. Finally, by substituting various rotational velocities into the FE model, the HSE on system natural frequencies are studied one by one as well as together. The results show that, when bearing is being extremely light preloaded, SBS frequencies are affected by the HSE of shaft more than bearing, especially where the <b>gyroscopic</b> <b>moment</b> effect of shaft is the most influential factor.
