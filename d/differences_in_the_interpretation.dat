In one narrative, the myth does not mention it by name, but only allude to it or when it does, the negative connotations are made obscure, because of its former closeness to the divine before it was disgraced for disobeying the laws of Roog from whose womb it grew out of.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{scholars}} make sharp {{distinctions between}} moral or ethical {{usage of the}} word [...] "Tao" [...] that is prominent in Confucianism and religious Taoism and the more metaphysical usage of the term used in philosophical Taoism and most forms of Mahayana Buddhism; others maintain {{that these are not}} separate usages or meanings, seeing them as mutually inclusive and compatible approaches to defining the principle. The original use of the term was as a form of praxis rather than theory - a term used as a convention to refer to something that otherwise cannot be discussed in words - and early writings such as the Tao Te Ching and the I Ching make pains to distinguish between conceptions of the Tao (sometimes referred to as [...] "named Tao") and the Tao itself (the [...] "unnamed Tao"), which cannot be expressed or understood in language.

5000|$|... ==Theory of Qu'ran== For almost fifty years, Farahi {{reflected}} {{over the}} Quran, which remained his chief interest and {{the focal point}} of all his writings. His greatest contribution in its study is his discovery of coherence in the Quran. He has achieved the impossible, remarked Shibli nomani while praising his student's grand achievement. it is considered superhuman accomplishment, Farahi demonstrated to all the western critics that with a sound understanding of the Arabic language one can appreciate the coherence in the Quran which is certainly not a haphazard collection of injunctions. By taking into consideration, the three constituents of nazm (coherence): order, proportion and unity he proved that a single interpretation of the Quran was possible. This alone was a far reaching consequence of the principle of Quranic nazm. Serious <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>interpretation</b> of the Quran which have given rise to the menace of religious sectarianism are actually the result of disregarding thematic and structural coherence in the arrangement and mutual relationship of various Quranic verses and paragraphs. Each sect has adopted its interpretation because isolating a verse from its context can associate multiple meanings to it. It is only the coherence of the Qur’an, which if considered leads to a definite and integrated understanding of the Divine Message. It is only then that the Qur’an can be truly regarded as a Mizan (Balance of Justice) and a Furqan (Distinguisher of Good and Evil). It is only then that the Quranic verse: Hold fast to the Cable of Allah and he not divided’ (3:103), can become a manifest reality and the unity in the Muslim Ummah be achieved. Farahi went on to enunciate certain principles necessary to understand and interpret the Quran. The foremost among them was the principle of coherence. He was able to show that unless the Quran is understood through a holistic approach a lot of its treasure of wisdom remains hidden.|$|E
