40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 55 - 56). The {{objective of}} this project was to produce a working design of a 3 D graphics rendering pipeline using an FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) and to develop proficiency {{in the development of}} a digital design using Verilog Hardware Description Language. The FPGA is loaded with the bitstream of the GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) which produces an object on an LCD monitor. The final deliverable is Veri log source code describing the GPU which has been implemented on a Virtex- 5 LXIl OT FPGA development board. The input to the FPGA is a bidirectional serial PS/ 2 signal which passes data back and forth between FPGA and trackball. The output from the FPGA is a digital video signal which displays a projected object on a monitor where the orientation can be changed when a new dataset configuration is loaded. Finally, the design provides a method to load in new datasets and initialize on-chip Block RAM content with the datasets. The primmy functional units of the 3 D rendering pipeline include the vertex fetcher unit, rotation unit, mouse movement unit, projection unit, perspective division unit, viewport mapping unit, line <b>drawing</b> <b>unit</b> and video generation unit...|$|E

40|$|During {{the whole}} {{manufacturing}} process, most draftsmen use CAD software to make engineering drawings. Yet, the training content in training organizations for draftsmen, which include Industrial Vocational High Schools, Junior Colleges and Vocational Training Centers etc., {{does not fit}} the industrial factories needs. The {{purpose of this study}} was to identify the essential competency items and their sequence. To achieve this purpose, both theoretical and empirical methods were used, such as document analysis, meetings of experts, and DACUM (Developing A Curriculum). The participants in this study included technicians, content specialists, and professors in the engineering drawing and design field. It was concluded that a total of 68 competency items could be grouped into 15 units. The 15 units are arranged in a sequence. The Geometry <b>Drawing</b> <b>unit</b> is first; it covers basic techniques. The second unit is orthographic Projection Drawing, which covers basic concepts. The CAD system is the third unit. When the learner has learned the basic techniques and basic concepts, he can learn the CAD system and then apply the CAD system skills to learn the other techniques and knowledge. Units 4 to 9 are working drawing units. Units 10 to 15 are professional drawing units. Currently, some of the draftsman in factories still use 2. 5 D CAD software, so the competency items include unit 10. In the future, when all of them use 3 -D software, they can skip unit 10. The results of this study provide a basis not only for curriculum development for engineering drawing education and worker training, but also for improvement in engineering drawing education...|$|E
40|$|This {{case study}} {{examines}} some key {{factors that influence}} student engagement in a blended learning environment, in particular, when using interactive online resources to learn Carpentry theory. The participants were volunteers from two parallel classes of secondary school students working toward Level 1 Building Construction and Allied Trade Skills Certificate designed for secondary schools by the Building Construction Industry Training Organisation. The participant researcher was also the teacher for both classes. Data in this case study was collected by observation, reflective journal writing, student records, group discussion and analysis of student course results. It showed that the students responded positively to the blended classroom environment and the interactive online resources developed by the researcher for this study. The blended learning environment in the classroom increased student participation, aided classroom management, and more than halved the time needed for both classes to finish the Instrumental <b>Drawing</b> <b>Unit</b> Standard 7502 while the interactive online resources enhanced student engagement and achievement {{in other areas of}} their theory. Students responded positively to the automated formative feedback and were encouraged by knowing their results instantly; working to gain top results and correct answers rather than just completing an activity by filling in the blanks. A competitive element was introduced by integrating a timer into the resources. Challenges encountered included limited access to computers and the necessity for students to share computers, a network failure which made the online resources unavailable for an extended period, and storage problems for the online resources to allow them to be accessed from the online learning environment at school and at home. This study concluded that technology can enable teachers to enhance their teaching and enrich the student learning environment through the introduction of a variety of media. Students still depended on face-to-face teacher input but, in the blended classroom environment and the online environment, the role of the teacher changed noticeably to a role of facilitator...|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} principled {{approach}} for cursive handwriting recognition which builds upon handwriting generation models. According to such models handwriting is a learned complex motoric task which {{is accomplished by}} sequencing simpler movement called stroke. As learning proceeds in human, so does fluency, which results in producing similar sequence of strokes in correspondence of the same sequence of letters. Such invariants represents therefore the basic <b>drawing</b> <b>units</b> to which an interpretation can be associated. Recognition is then achieved by detecting the invariants used to produce the word to be recognized, associating to them their interpretations, and eventually concatenating the interpretations along the ink of the word. Experiments on on-line data of the current implementation are reported and discussed to show {{the effectiveness of the}} method...|$|R

40|$|Occupational stress among police {{officers}} {{is an important}} area of research because of the realisation that less stressed {{police officers}} are more effective {{and they tend to}} stay longer with the employing department. The spinoffs of longer stay with the safety and security department are, inter alia, less training costs on replacement staff, utilisation of more experienced staff in critical safety and security areas, and organisational commitment. A self-administered questionnaire was used to collect data from 276 police officers. A stratified random sampling technique was utilised to <b>draw</b> <b>units</b> of analysis for the study. A response rate of 75 % was obtained. Responses were analysed using frequency analysis. The results confirmed that police officers in the Sebokeng Cluster experienced role conflict.
