40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{explore the}} {{perceptions}} of general practice trainees regarding their discipline and to compare these spontaneously expressed views with recently proposed definitions of general practice. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A qualitative focus-group {{study was conducted in}} one Belgian and two French medical schools. Twenty-eight trainees took part (16 from Belgium and 12 from France). The transcripts were analysed by the <b>immersion</b> <b>crystallization</b> method. RESULTS: The participants in this study seemed prepared to take on the many responsibilities outlined in various definitions of general practice, but feared personal commitment to accessibility and continuous care. Being skilled clinicians and patients' advocates formed their "raison d'être" in the healthcare system. They were reluctant to act as gatekeepers within the system, a role that might jeopardize their advocacy function for their patients. They mentioned the lack of appeal of entrepreneurship aspect of practice. Participants reported that training settings typically offer traditional models of practice, which sometimes led them to feel estranged from a profession that they felt needs reorganization. CONCLUSIONS: Participants' descriptions generally coincided with official definitions of general practitioners' tasks, except for practice management and gate-keeping aspects. They were willing to accept the burden of general practice as long as responsibility could be shared and as long as there was freedom for flexible progress along a modern career track...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{aimed to}} qualitatively explore the Hispanic faith-based {{communities}} 2 ̆ 7 perceptions {{and willingness to}} address the childhood obesity epidemic. We will gain insights on faith-based communities’ perceptions of childhood obesity; their openness and willingness {{to address the issue}} of childhood obesity; their perceived barriers and facilitators to implementing faith-based community obesity prevention programs; and their ideas of appropriate obesity interventions in faith-based community settings. METHOD: In-depth interviews with 30 Hispanic church leaders and 7 focus groups with 38 church attending Hispanic children and 38 parents in San Antonio’s West Side, a low-income Hispanic community, were used to collect qualitative data. Interviews and focus groups were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative analysis was sequential, utilizing a combination of editing and <b>immersion</b> <b>crystallization.</b> Pertinent research findings will be disseminated to policy makers, community groups and health professionals through town hall meetings, community forums, conference presentation and publications. RESULTS: Preliminary Findings demonstrated that Hispanic faith-based communities are aware of the burning issues associated with obesity and its consequences, such as diabetes and hypertension, affecting their congregations. Both church leaders and members showed willingness to address childhood obesity in faith-based community settings. They perceived a relationship between ones’ faith and health. They identified the needs for culturally sensitive health education through sermons and Sunday school, free after-school activities or a summer camp providing physical activity opportunities for both parents and children, healthy cooking classes, church and home food environmental changes, as well as congregation-wide healthy competition. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that Hispanic faith-based communities in San Antonio are aware of and willing to address childhood obesity among their congregations. Implementation of future childhood obesity programs through the Hispanic faith-based community is worthy of investigation in the future...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: It {{has been}} evident that on average college {{students}} experienced excess weight gain as they transited from high school. The objectives {{of this study}} were to qualitatively explore college students’ perceived barriers and facilitators to maintaining a healthy bodyweight and identify the key modifiable factors underlying unhealthy behaviors. METHOD: The study employed photovoice (PV), a qualitative research method, in undergraduate students in South Texas. Participants took pictures and wrote descriptions of three perceived barriers and three facilitators to maintaining a healthy body weight; they were then asked to choose one of each for discussion. Eight focus groups were conducted with 96 participants and were audio-taped and transcribed verbatim. Qualitative analysis was sequential, utilizing a combination of editing and <b>immersion</b> <b>crystallization.</b> RESULTS: We were able to identify an array of common perceived facilitators and barriers to maintaining a healthy body weight among college students. Common barriers included time constraints, peer influences, unhealthy vending machine options, high cost of and limited access to healthy foods, obesogenic campus infrastructure, cultural environment, and social norms. Common facilitators included social support, access to a campus recreation center, having a variety of physical activity options available, health education classes, acting as a role model for their children, health benefits through work, sidewalks and staircases around campus, and the ability to pack healthier foods from home to take to campus. CONCLUSION: This study highlights the need for policy and environmental changes on college campuses such as: more affordable and accessible variety of healthier food options; meal heating and refrigeration facilities; bans on unhealthy vending content; and mandatory physical and health education. Social marketing campaigns and support groups would facilitate a shift of cultural and social norms toward a health promoting attitude...|$|E
40|$|Promoting early {{interest}} in healthcare careers among youth from underserved areas is one promising strategy {{for addressing the}} health professional shortage in such communities, Most career choice studies try to predict outcomes using such traditional measures as grades and test scores, This study examines experiences influencing healthcare career interest among high-school students participating in health professions introductory programs in underserved communities. The opinions of parents and teachers regarding students' motivations are also considered. Seven focus groups (N= 51) were conducted in one rural and two largely minority urban communities in New York State designated as health professional shortage areas. Qualitative data analysis involved a theory-driven, <b>immersion</b> and <b>crystallization</b> approach following the experiential learning model. Constructive experiences with the healthcare system, family role-modeling and support, interactive health-related school activities, the media, inspirational and accessible school staff, and strategic community partnerships, among other factors, facilitated student {{interest in}} health professions. Findings suggest that underserved and disenfranchised community environments still pose challenges for furthering healthcare career interest among youth...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To explore family physicians' {{experiences}} {{during the}} first year of Ontario's universal influenza immunization program. DESIGN: Qualitative study using in-depth interviews. SETTING: Thames Valley region of southwestern Ontario. PARTICIPANTS: A maximum variation sample of nine family physicians selected by snowball sampling after initial consultation with a local family physician advisory committee. METHOD: Interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Analysis was sequential, using a combination of editing, <b>immersion,</b> and <b>crystallization.</b> Interview transcripts were read by individual members of the team who met to compare findings at several stages during data collection. MAIN FINDINGS: The program affected family physicians because immunization strategies designed for immunizing high-risk patients needed to be modified to deal with greater numbers of patients. While generally supportive of the program, physicians found it difficult to implement. Responses reflected ongoing conflict between individual and public health priorities, particularly regarding children and pregnant women. CONCLUSION: The program could have been more effective if the culture and climate of Ontario family practice had been considered during its development and implementation...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{discover}} how physicians {{develop an understanding}} of Native patients and communities that enables them to communicate better with these patients. DESIGN: Qualitative method of in-depth interviews. SETTING: Native communities across Canada. PARTICIPANTS: Ten non-Native physicians providing primary care to Native patients and communities. METHOD: In-depth, semistructured interviews explored communication strategies developed by primary care physicians working with Native patients. The audiotaped and transcribed interviews were analyzed by the investigators using the phenomenologic approach of <b>immersion</b> and <b>crystallization.</b> MAIN FINDINGS: Three main themes emerged. First was elements of communication: during patient-physician communication, physicians speak less, take more time with patients, and become comfortable with silence. Second was community context: patients' illnesses are not distinct from their community context; patient care and community relations, culture, and values are often inseparable. Third was the process of change in physicians: over time, participants increased understanding of Native culture, ways of communicating, and behaviour. Change comes about through long service, listening well, and participating in community events. CONCLUSION: Developing cross-cultural communication was difficult and took years, if not forever. Understanding Native communities changed physicians. They described a journey of self-examination, development of personal relationships, and rewards and frustrations...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: In Peru, {{transgender}} women (TW) experience unique vulnerabilities for HIV infection due {{to factors}} that limit access to, and quality of, HIV prevention, treatment and care services. Yet, despite {{recent advances in}} understanding factors associated with HIV vulnerability among TW globally, limited scholarship has examined how Peruvian TW cope with this reality and how existing community-level resilience strategies are enacted despite pervasive social and economic exclusion facing the community. Addressing this need, our study applies the understanding of social capital as a social determinant of health and examines its relationship to HIV vulnerabilities to TW in Peru. Methods: Using qualitative methodology to provide an in-depth portrait, we assessed (1) intersections between social marginalization, social capital and HIV vulnerabilities; and (2) community-level resilience strategies employed by TW to buffer against social marginalization and to link to needed HIV-related services in Peru. Between January and February 2015, 48 TW participated (mean age =  29, range =  18 – 44) {{in this study that}} included focus group discussions and demographic surveys. Analyses were guided by an <b>immersion</b> <b>crystallization</b> approach and all coding was conducted using Dedoose Version 6. 1. 18. Results: Themes associated with HIV vulnerability included experiences of multilevel stigma and limited occupational opportunities that placed TW at risk for, and limited their engagement with, existing HIV services. Emergent resiliency-based strategies included peer-to-peer and intergenerational knowledge sharing, supportive clinical services (e. g. group-based clinic attendance) and emotional support through social cohesion (i. e. feeling part of a community). Conclusion: This study highlights the importance of TW communities as support structures that create and deploy social resiliency-based strategies aimed at deterring and mitigating the impact of social vulnerabilities to discrimination, marginalization and HIV risk for individual TW in Peru. Public health strategies seeking to provide HIV prevention, treatment and care for this population will benefit from recognizing existing social capital within TW communities and incorporating its strengths within HIV prevention interventions. At the intersection of HIV vulnerabilities and collective agency, dimensions of bridging and bonding social capital emerged as resiliency strategies used by TW to access needed healthcare services in Peru. Fostering TW solidarity and peer support are key components to ensure acceptability and sustainability of HIV prevention and promotion efforts...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Compassionate {{caring and}} dignity are key {{priorities}} in current policy and research agendas and {{are central to}} the quality of experience for patients, families and staff. Developing relationships has been identified as a key component in enabling excellence in caring to be realised in practice. However {{there is little evidence that}} identifies the processes involved in delivering compassionate relationship-centred care. This study sought to address this gap in the knowledge base. Aims and research questions The study's aim was to examine and evaluate processes that enhance compassionate relationship-centred care within an older people care setting in an acute hospital. Key objectives were: to develop an understanding of the concept of compassionate relationship-centred care within the practice setting through exploring the views, perceptions and experiences of staff, patients and their families; to develop, implement and evaluate strategies that promote this concept; to examine the processes that need to be put in place to enable sustainability of these strategies; and to identify the lessons learnt to inform practice, education, policy and research. This study was part of a larger programme of work that aimed to integrate compassionate care across practice and education. Approach and methods My role as a senior nurse and practitioner researcher meant that I was in a unique position to be able to capture not just theoretical views of compassion but how this was enacted in practice. To do this the study used the approach of appreciative inquiry. A range of methods was used: participant observation, stories using emotional touchpoints, photo-elicitation, and group discussions to explore beliefs and values. Data were continually fedback to staff participants to involve them in analysis. An iterative and inductive process of <b>immersion</b> <b>crystallization</b> was used to analyse data. Findings A key finding was the development of a practice model to support practitioners to deliver compassionate relationship-centred care. This model suggests that, in order to deliver such care, people need to engage in the process of appreciative caring conversations in order to understand a) who people are and what matters to them; and b) how people feel about their experience. This in turn enables a process of working together to shape the way things are done. The findings support the notion that during these caring conversations the practitioner needs to connect emotionally, be curious, collaborative, able to compromise, considerate of others perspectives, courageous and actively celebrate when practices have worked well in order to promote compassionate relationship-centred care. This framework comprises the 7 ‘C's of caring conversations and makes a unique contribution to the body of knowledge in providing practical guidance as to the ‘how' of compassionate relationship-centred care. Key outcomes of implementing this model were that people felt comfortable to express emotions, developed stronger relationships, were more consistent in delivering compassionate care practice across the team, and had a sense of learned hopefulness in the face of complex and competing demands. Conclusions and implications Implementation of activities in practice to support this way of working revealed that these processes are complex, often requiring the practitioner to takes risks and therefore the provision of appropriate support, facilitation and strong leadership are important factors in helping to sustain such practices. The outcomes of this research build upon the existing knowledge base by providing a practice model that specifies how to deliver compassionate relationship-centred care, and they demonstrate the impact of using appreciative approaches to facilitate improvement within health care contexts.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Sport Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2006. Stress {{and coping}} are complex {{phenomena}} {{that are not}} always fully understood. They are psychological factors that impinge on individuals and people’s responses in dealing with them are described and interpreted in various ways. This study compared the coping strategies used by football players from ethnically diverse backgrounds. The aim was to explore {{the role that the}} environment, ethnicity and culture play in players' responses to stressful situations. A sample of 33 players was drawn from a professional club in the Professional Premier Soccer League in the Western Cape, Republic of South Africa. Subjects were representative in terms of race, age, years of experience and playing positions. Eleven black, coloured and white players for each group were selected for individual interviews. Their ages ranged between 15 and 32 years. An interpretive-qualitative research methodology was employed. Semistructured interviews and a biographical questionnaire were used as tools to gather information. The data were analyzed using interpretive analysis or the <b>immersion</b> <b>crystallization</b> method. The results revealed that football players were exposed to stress and there were differences and similarities in the way they conducted themselves. The similarities were recorded on matters related to match situations e. g., pressure to perform, inclusion in a starting line-up, and unruly behavior of supporters. Differences were cited on issues related to language, culture, financial matters, poor playing conditions, negative evaluation of the team by others, losing matches, referees' decisions and being away from home. These differences were found both between and within ethnic groups. Players' perceptions of stress showed that black players were experiencing more stress than the other two ethnic groups and white players were experiencing far less stress than the other two groups. Despite this finding, the majority of players reported to have been in control of stressful situations. The perception of lack of control was reported by black and coloured players only. It appeared that background experience of stressful events was producing greater psychosocial consequences for non-white players than white players. The football players used multiple strategies to cope with their sport challenges and there were both differences and similarities within and between the ethnic groups in the use of these strategies. Subjects used problem-focused coping, emotion-focused coping, passive coping, and avoidance coping in stressful situations. Problem-focused coping and emotion-focused coping were the dominant strategies employed by all three groups. Passive coping and avoidance coping were the lesser-used strategies and were employed by the three groups in situations where players felt that they could not exert control e. g., playing conditions or dubious referees' decisions. Self-criticism, not blaming others, adopting a negative approach, substance use/abuse and turning to religion were the strategies that appeared only in specific groups. This finding supports the hypothesis of differences in strategies related to differences in ethnic backgrounds. It was also revealed that football players were responding differently to stressful challenges that were presented at the different stages of the match. The dominant strategies used at the pre-match stage by the nonwhite group were: planning and preparation, relaxation, praying, focusing and concentration. At the same stage, white players used mostly focusing, concentration and planning. There were strong similarities between the groups in the use of these strategies. During the match stage, non-white players used active coping, positive approach, suppression of competitive activities, focusing and concentration. White players used similar strategies including emotional expression and mental disengagement. Different strategies were employed by players during the match stage, most of them being problem-focused strategies. In the post-match stage players used less-dominant coping strategies. Some strategies were used by players in all three ethnic groups and others appeared in specific groups only, e. g., substance use (coloured group) and passive thinking (white group). The study further revealed that coping strategies could be classified either as sport or non-sport related. A variety of sport-related strategies were found mostly during the pre-match and match stages. The nonsport related strategies appeared mostly during the post-match stage and were used mostly by non-white players. Concerning the processes involved in the selection of strategies, the study revealed that thought-out processes, automatic processes, influence of experience and a combination of processes were used to identify and select coping strategies. Processing of information was a preferred option used by the three groups of players to identify strategies and very few players used automatic processes. Between-group differences were found in the relationship between environmental background and previous experience and the players' selection of coping strategies. For black and coloured players this influence related mostly from factors outside their home environment. For white players it came from within their home situations. The study showed that factors that affected the players in selecting coping strategies, were both intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic factors included personal safety and protection, performance, self-control and personal experience. Extrinsic factors included stress, influence of others, institutional influences, social background, pleasing others, family obligation, opponents and research. White players used intrinsic and extrinsic factors with equal frequency. Non-white players on the other hand, used fewer intrinsic factors than extrinsic factors. The results also showed that relatively less-experienced players were inclined to use achievement motivation as a determining factor. Black players were influenced by one other factor that did not appear in the other groups, that is, family obligations. Finally, exhaustion, cultural differences, language, absence of a family support structure, peer pressure, home circumstances, communication, diet, substance use/abuse, being in a new environment, personality differences and high expectations were identified as factors that restrict the use of coping strategy. Exhaustion and cultural differences appeared across all three groups. Group differences were however observed in language, absence of a family support structure, peer pressure, home circumstances, high expectations, and absence of compliments. These restrictive factors were experienced differently within and between the three ethnic groups and originated from exposure, challenges, and experiences that players encounter in their daily life situations...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: While {{increasing}} acuity {{levels and}} the concomitant complexity of service demand that physicians {{be involved in}} in-home care, conflicting evidence and opinions do not show how this can best be achieved. DESIGN: A phenomenologic research design was used to obtain insights into the challenges and opportunities of integrating physicians' services into the usual in-home services in London, Ont. SETTING: Home care in London, Ont. PARTICIPANTS: Twelve participants included three patients, two family caregivers, two family physicians, the program's nurse practitioner, two case managers, and two community nurses. METHOD: In-depth interviews with a maximally varied purposeful sample of patients, caregivers, and providers were analyzed using <b>immersion</b> and <b>crystallization</b> techniques. MAIN FINDINGS: Findings revealed the potential for enhanced continuity of care and interdisciplinary team functioning. Having a nurse practitioner, interdisciplinary team-building exercises and meetings, regular face-to-face contact among all providers, support for family caregivers, and 24 -hour coverage for physicians {{were found to be}} essential for success. CONCLUSION: Integration of services takes time, money, and sustained commitment, particularly when undertaken in geographically isolated communities. Informed choice and a fair remuneration system remain important considerations for family physicians...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{documented}} that there is decreased access and utilization of healthcare services by minority populations. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore experiences with, and views of, the healthcare system among remotely situated First Nations people of coastal British Columbia (BC), to shed light on elements considered crucial to healthcare delivery. The study was conducted as a critical ethnography with an underlying framework of phenomenology and critical social theory. Multiple sources of data collection included private interviews, community observations, conversations, celebratory gatherings, participant-observer field notes, and the art and music of the people involved. Multiphase data management consistent with <b>immersion</b> and <b>crystallization</b> offered reflective/emotional,structured and synthesis levels of analysis, providing a rich aggregate of themes. Findings revealed that individuals who had developed relationships of trust with providers, or whose family members acted as advocates in healthcare encounters reported a higher level of satisfaction with the healthcare they received. However, many voiced perceptions of prejudice and stigmatization, believing healthcare to be of a lower quality than that received by non-Aboriginal BC residents. These findings were deeply embedded contextually and were framed by the legacy of a colonial past, ongoing 'civilized oppression,' and the socioeconomics of isolated living.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Mergers of {{residency}} {{training programs}} {{have become more}} common, but little has been published about their educational impact. Following our own merger, we sought to understand this process and its aftermath by conducting focus groups. Methods: Three 1 -hour focus groups were conducted—one with third-year residents, one with first- and second-year residents, and one with core faculty members. The interview script {{was based on a}} five-factor transitional model where each factor represented a potential fracture point that could result in organizational conflict. The five factors were curriculum, corporate culture, day-to-day operations, teaching environment, and financial resources. Focus group audiotapes were transcribed, and the investigators independently identified themes using an <b>immersion</b> and <b>crystallization</b> approach. Feedback from participants was obtained. Results: Themes identified included unmet potential of the combined curriculum, a blending of two disparate cultures resulting in feelings of loss and displacement for some, and a sense of rapid policy change and lack of resident and faculty accountability. Faculty recommendations for other programs involved in mergers include creating frequent facilitated retreats, acknowledging loss, and establishing new rituals for the combined program. Conclusions: The transition through a merger of two residency programs is difficult and has direct educational and emotional impact. Such difficulties can, in part, be predicted, and improved communicatio...|$|R
40|$|A {{group of}} seven asthmatics were {{identified}} from family practice, following administration of a questionnaire, as expressing feelings of stigma or pessimism concerning their condition. They were interviewed in depth, using interpretive research methods, concerning their experience of asthma. Interpretive research uses qualitative methods to explore the emotions, feelings and meaning of the event of interest. All the interviews were transcribed verbatim by the principal researcher and analyzed by the technique of <b>immersion</b> and <b>crystallization.</b> The picture of asthma that emerged for {{the participants in this}} study gave rise to the concept of a dynamic model to illustrate their asthma experience. The model showed asthma as a continuum from diagnosis to final acceptance. The transistion phase included a need to integrate knowledge, experience and self-awareness before progressing to acceptance and control. A mentoring relationship greatly facilitated resolution of the transition phase. Progress along the continuum was accompanied by diminishing fear. Another important theme to emerge was the fact that tiredness and physical limitations were common feelings, irrespective of the severity of the asthma in medical terms. The implications of this research for health workers is that they have much to contribute in assisting astmatics to gain control over their condition, particularly in respect to understanding what knowledge concerning their condition is relevant to asthmatics and in understanding the potential benefit to asthmatics of a mentoring relationship. ...|$|R
40|$|Hispanics are {{the largest}} {{minority}} group in the United States. They are disproportionately affected by diabetes and {{are twice as likely}} to develop diabetes then are non-Hispanic white adults. Mexican Americans {{are the largest}} subpopulation of Hispanics in the United States and one out of ten has diabetes. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to explore the experiences of adults of Mexican origin who were newly informed of having elevated glucose levels in the diabetes range. This qualitative inquiry was conducted by means of in-depth semi-structured interviews with eight individuals of Mexican origin who had been recently informed of having hyperglycemic values exceeding the threshold of diabetes. A modified version of Kleinman's explanatory model of illness was used to elicit the EM of high blood sugar of the study participants. Qualitative content analysis was utilized to analyze the data. Domains, categories and subcategories were elicited through the <b>immersion</b> and <b>crystallization</b> of thematic units attained through the in-depth, semi-structured interviews. Three overarching domains emerged describing the experience and perception the participants had of being newly informed of having high blood sugar: 1) EM of High Blood Sugar 2) Response to Being Informed of High Blood Sugar 3) Facilitators and Barriers to Seeking Care. The participants describe a Temporal Order of how they responded to being informed of having high blood sugar. Facilitators, barriers and gaps to seeking care was also discussed.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} two-phased {{investigation}} was to enhance understanding of urinary incontinence (UI) knowledge translation (KT) to inform how UI management knowledge might be translated within in-home nursing practice and family caregiving. Although UI can be managed conservatively, it is a principal reason for the breakdown of family-care and care recipient admission to long-term care. Research has afforded little insight into family caregivers’ experience of KT {{and the process of}} in-home KT for UI management. The first study used a hermeneutic phenomenological approach to explore family caregivers’ experience of UI KT. Data were collected from in-depth interviews with a purposive sample of caregivers (n= 4) and analyzed with <b>immersion</b> and <b>crystallization</b> interpretive methods. KT was experienced through the social interaction of working together/not working together that was contextualized by homecare and personal attributes. The phase two grounded theory study explored the enactment of in-home KT. In-depth interview data were collected from a theoretical sample of 23 family caregivers, homecare recipients, and homecare providers. Constant comparison and Glaser’s analysis criteria were used to create the substantive theory of Translating Knowledge Through Relating. Findings illuminated how intersubjectivity and bi-directional relational interactions are interlinked in and essential to translating in-home care knowledge which is largely tacit and experiential in nature. Insights afforded understandings about how relational practice is necessary to foster mutual and equitable social construction of KT. The practical application of ‘Translating Knowledge Through Relating’ may constitute an important component of promoting health as a resource for everyday living with UI...|$|R
40|$|Older adults {{continue}} to live longer, and their desire is to not only live longer but to remain as independent as possible. Therefore, older adults strive to live more productive lives, not to just {{continue to}} exist. By living a healthy life, older adults are empowered to take control, not only of their health but of other important life decisions. The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore and describe rural older adults‘ behaviors toward healthy lifestyles. The theoretical framework for the study was Pender‘s health promotion model, which addressed factors that enhance health-promoting behavior, leading to improved health and quality of life for the older rural adult. This ethnographic study was conducted in West Tennessee, with 30 rural older adults, aged 62 years or older, independently living in a senior center apartment complex. Three research questions guided data collection: What are the barriers to health-promoting behaviors in rural older adults?; What are the health-promoting behaviors in the rural older adult?; and What qualities facilitate healthy aging in rural older adults? Data were collected through two interviews with each participant and participant observation. Key themes that emerged through the analysis process of <b>immersion</b> and <b>crystallization</b> were unhealthy behaviors, self-control, and healthy qualities. This study revealed that some rural older adults felt that the most important factors in aging were being positive about life, having a zest for life, and living viii life to the fullest. Some participants had knowledge of healthy behaviors, but through choice or lifelong habits, they continued with unhealthy behavioral choices. PhD NursingDoctoralUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} growing {{awareness}} of the unique challenges facing children recovering from an acquired brain injury (ABI). Within the literature, {{much has been written about}} the importance of a variety of therapeutic interventions throughout the rehabilitation process. However, the role of the teacher is rarely mentioned in the discussion of early-stage rehabilitation, despite the central role school plays in the lives of children. Using a case study methodology, this study investigates the benefits of extended educational and therapeutic collaboration, facilitated through the involvement of a hospital teacher. Three cases from a children's hospital are explored, beginning at the time of each child's accident, following through several months of intensive rehabilitation, and culminating in the eventual return to the community school. Through <b>immersion</b> and <b>crystallization</b> (Crabtree & Miller, 1999) the study identifies three meta-themes emerging from the transcribed voices of student, family, hospital and school, as participants describe the rehabilitation experience from their own perspective. Results are offered in a reader's theatre style presentation (Meyer, 2001) to emphasize these contrasting perspectives. The research offers compelling evidence that the early intervention of a rehabilitation school provides hope, normalization, motivation and a functional context for therapy for these individuals. Teamwork and communication between school, hospital and family is observed to be an effective method of establishing a baseline profile as individual rehabilitation goals are established. This teamwork approach supports teacher education and facilitates planning for success as the student returns to the community school. From the data, a socio-cultural model for paediatric rehabilitation is developed. This model provides a framework for much needed socialization and family advocacy, while addressing the need for ongoing support...|$|R

These immigrants have an increased Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) prevalence as well as diabetes complications occurring after they {{have lived in the}} U. S. for three years or more. Diabetes self-management among Sub-Saharan African immigrants with T 2 DM is poorly understood; diabetes data for Sub-Saharan Africa immigrants are interspersed among data of Blacks or African-Americans. The purpose of this qualitative descriptive study was to describe Sub-Saharan African immigrants' health-illness transition experiences associated with T 2 DM self-management. The framework for the study was the middle-range nursing theory of transitions. Purposive and snowball sampling were used to recruit participants. The primary investigator conducted face-to-face semi-structured in-depth interviews with 10 Sub-Saharan African immigrant men and women with T 2 DM, and used qualitative content analysis to analyze the data. Domains were selected apriori to respond to each research question, and categories and subcategories were elicited through the <b>immersion</b> and <b>crystallization</b> of thematic units. Four overarching domains selected apriori describing the health-illness transition experiences the participants had with T 2 DM self-management: 1) Knowledge of T 2 DM Self-Management Behaviors 2) Current T 2 DM Self-Management Behaviors 3) Inhibitors of T 2 DM Self-Management 4) Facilitators of T 2 DM Self-Management. Health professionals should be equipped with an understanding of the properties and conditions of health-illness transition necessary to build a foundation that facilitates healthy adaptation to the T 2 DM transition. The knowledge from this study will lead to the development of culturally tailored interventions to decrease inhibitors of and encourage self-management in daily diabetes care for Sub-Saharan African immigrants with T 2 DM...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{looked inside}} {{the black box}} of stroke care, so called because its {{contents}} are not clearly defined. This case study of success illustrated how a new inpatient stroke unit (SU) was created in an inner London teaching hospital, transforming treatment for patients with stroke. Whilst {{it is known that}} good stroke care results in improved patient outcomes, it is not fully understood how or why. As stroke is the second major cause of death in adults worldwide, and a leading cause of adult disability in the UK, it is essential more is known about how evidence translates into practical knowledge for use in mainstream practice. This action research study, through the systematic documentation and evaluation of the processes and outcomes, has unpacked and illuminated factors that enabled development of success, and provides the first empirical account of its kind. This study adds to the knowledge of knowing how. A variety of qualitative and quantitative methods were used to generate data between January 2001 and November 2002. Findings were analysed using <b>Immersion</b> I <b>Crystallization</b> and descriptive statistics. When the black box of stroke unit care was opened, four key interrelated themes emerged from the process findings: building a multidisciplinary stroke team; developing practice based knowledge and skills in stroke; valuing the central role of the nurse in stroke care and creating an organisational climate for supporting improvement. Analyses of findings suggest the creation of excellence in stroke care was linked {{to the development of a}} Community of Practice (CoP), which combines three elements; domain, community and practice, into a conceptual framework of learning that fundamentally places the acquisition of knowledge into a social process of learning. Whilst improvement initiatives have recently been linked in the literature to CoPs, no guidance is available on how this should be done. This thesis makes an original contribution to the body of knowledge by providing the first empirical evidence of not only on how a CoP was created, but shows how it developed into a functional multidisciplinary CoP, a concept identified in the literature as difficult to accomplish. In concluding, issues related to practice, research, education and policy are raised for future considerations...|$|R
40|$|Teen {{pregnancy}} in Hispanic {{youth is}} a poorly understood phenomenon, {{thought to have}} numerous and overlapping sociocultural influences. Although Hispanics have had the highest teen pregnancy rates in the United States since 1995 and pregnancy rates that have declined much more slowly when compared to every other ethnic group, there is limited literature about Hispanic youth whose families are long-term residents of the United States and {{the factors that influence}} the decision-making processes and sexual behaviors of this population. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore and describe the attitudes and behaviors related to teen pregnancy and parenting in Hispanic female teens from long-term families in northern New Mexico (NNM) (those with at least three generations of familial residence and termed Long-Term Hispanics [LTH]), whose primary language was English, and who have experienced pregnancy and motherhood in the 12 months prior to participation. A focused ethnographic design was used. The study was conducted in two counties of northern New Mexico known to have high rates of teen pregnancy and where the population is majority Hispanic with long-term residency in the areas. Data were collected using interviews with 10 adolescent LTH mothers (15 - 17 years old), 10 adults who work with adolescent mothers, and participant observation. Data were analyzed inductively through the process of <b>Immersion</b> and <b>Crystallization,</b> resulting in themes and sub-themes that captured the essence of the issue under study and which were contextualized with the spoken and observed experiences of those studied. Key findings of this study include themes that reveal the chaos and instability which characterized the homes of youth, low levels of communication related to reproductive issues in homes and schools, disappointment expressed by families and the community in response to teen pregnancy, and the role transitions/career choices teens experience when becoming mothers. The results of this study will aid in increasing the knowledge base related to long-term Hispanic youth and the many sociocultural factors affecting their sexual decisions and behaviors.

40|$|Since the {{introduction}} of national cervical cancer screening in the 1960 s, the mortality rates for cervical cancer have decreased significantly in most Western European nations. The countries of the European Union (EU) employ both opportunistic and organized screening programs for cervical cancer using Papanicolaou (Pap) smears as the method of screening. However, data from 2000 showed that Germany, an EU member, had a considerably higher incidence of cervical cancer mortality than did the EU. Study findings in the United States, Australia, and Thailand indicated that participation of Thai women was suboptimal. The extent to which those findings apply to Thai women in other countries is not known. The purpose of this focused ethnographic {{study was to determine}} the knowledge and attitudes about cervical cancer among Thai women living in Germany, their health beliefs and practices regarding cervical cancer, their cervical cancer screening practices, and the barriers to participation in cervical cancer screening. The Health Belief Model provided the theoretical guidance for the development of the research questions and the interview guide that was used in the interviews. Data were collected via semistructured interviews with 30 Thai immigrant women and 2 practicing German health care providers. Data were analyzed inductively through the process of <b>immersion</b> and <b>crystallization.</b> Key findings indicated that all participants had heard about cervical cancer screening and described their knowledge of cervical cancer based on personal, traditional, and clinical knowledge. Participants integrated both traditional and modern health beliefs and practices, which influenced their cervical cancer screening practices. Participants offered an array of cervical cancer prevention practices, including having a yearly Pap test. Personal, cultural, and health care system barriers were identified. Age, levels of education, and socioeconomic status did not seem to be factors in participating in screening, whereas having health insurance seemed to increase the likelihood of participation. The findings of this study may assist German health care providers in gaining insight and a more in-depth understanding of the cultural implications and barriers that may prevent Thai women from seeking early screening, thus, having a direct impact on immigrant Thai women’s preventative health.
