5|$|Mercyful Fate {{were a part}} of the <b>first</b> <b>wave</b> {{of black}} metal, along with other groups, such as Venom, Bathory and Hellhammer. Many of these groups helped {{establish}} the style upon which future black metal artists would later build. Unlike the other <b>first</b> <b>wave</b> bands, typical elements of Mercyful Fate's style are influences from progressive rock, epic 1970s hard rock and traditional heavy metal. As many of the band's songs featured lyrics about Satanism and the occult and King Diamond was among the first black metal musicians to use the now famous corpse paint, Mercyful Fate was a pioneer in developing black metal, although their musical style was not as much an influence as that of other <b>first</b> <b>wave</b> bands.|$|E
5|$|The {{fact that}} most of those who {{recovered}} from first-wave infections were now immune showed that {{it must have been the}} same strain of flu. This was most dramatically illustrated in Copenhagen, which escaped with a combined mortality rate of just 0.29% (0.02% in the <b>first</b> <b>wave</b> and 0.27% in the second wave) because of exposure to the less-lethal <b>first</b> <b>wave.</b>|$|E
5|$|Calypso {{has been}} popular in Dominica since the 1950s; the first Calypso King was crowned in 1959. Popular calypso in Dominica {{has always been}} closely {{associated}} with steelpan music.

40|$|In the <b>first</b> <b>waves</b> of an {{oscillating}} jet {{the velocity}} of the surface is {{less than that of}} the center. Application of Bohr's formula to these <b>first</b> <b>waves</b> gives values of the surface tension which are too high. Hansen and collaborators have proposed an empirical method of correction permitting calculation of the correct surface tension even {{in this part of the}} jet. This method, valid for pure liquids, is in the case of solutions subject to errors concerning the true surface age, due to the strong extension in area of each element of surface in the <b>first</b> <b>waves.</b> The authors tested the method used by Hommelen which consists in selecting capillaries which reduce the number of waves to which Bohr's formula is not applicable. © 1962.

5|$|On 24 April 1915, the {{battalion}} disembarked from Suffolk and boarded , which was bound for Gallipoli in the Dardanelles. At 4:30 {{on the morning}} of 25 April, 'A' and 'C' Companies of {{the battalion}} landed at Anzac Cove around Ari Burnu Knoll, a mile south of Fisherman's Hut, on the left flank of the <b>first</b> <b>wave.</b> Under heavy machine-gun and rifle fire, the battalion stormed the cliffs, driving the Turks back. However, the battalion became disorganised during the landing and mixed with other units. Small sections of the battalion were engaged in firefights all along the Australian front. Major Edmund Drake-Brockman, one of the battalion's senior officers, tried to sort the scattered men into their battalions: 9th on the right, 10th in the middle and 11th on the left. Meanwhile, {{the second half of the}} battalion landed further north of the <b>first</b> <b>wave,</b> directly under heavy machine-gun fire from Turks fully prepared and alerted by the <b>first</b> <b>wave.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{landings}} initially encountered heavy {{resistance from}} the German 716th Division; the preliminary bombardment proved less effective than had been hoped, and rough weather forced the <b>first</b> <b>wave</b> to be delayed until 07:35. Several assault companies—notably those of the Royal Winnipeg Rifles and The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada—took heavy casualties in the opening minutes of the <b>first</b> <b>wave.</b> Strength of numbers, coordinated fire support from artillery and armoured squadrons, cleared most of the coastal defences within two hours of landing. The reserves of the 7th and 8th brigades began deploying at 08:30 (along with the Royal Marines), while the 9th Brigade began its deployment at 11:40.|$|E
5|$|The {{second wave}} {{was also not}} {{under the command of}} the Emperor and was made up of a number of armies with their own commanders. Together, this group and the <b>first</b> <b>wave</b> {{numbered}} an estimated 60,000.|$|E

5|$|In the 1820s, Boston's {{population}} grew rapidly, and the city's ethnic composition changed dramatically with the <b>first</b> <b>wave</b> of European immigrants. Irish immigrants dominated the <b>first</b> <b>wave</b> of newcomers during this period, especially following the Irish Potato Famine; by 1850, about 35,000 Irish lived in Boston. In {{the latter half}} of the 19th century, the city saw increasing numbers of Irish, Germans, Lebanese, Syrians, French Canadians, and Russian and Polish Jews settling in the city. By the end of the 19th century, Boston's core neighborhoods had become enclaves of ethnically distinct immigrants. Italians inhabited the North End, Irish dominated South Boston and Charlestown, and Russian Jews lived in the West End. Irish and Italian immigrants brought with them Roman Catholicism. Currently, Catholics make up Boston's largest religious community, and the Irish have played a major role in Boston politics since the early 20th century; prominent figures include the Kennedys, Tip O'Neill, and John F. Fitzgerald.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, the Government {{decided that}} a further {{generation}} of new towns in South East England was needed to take the projected population increase of London, after the initial 1940s/1950s wave. Bletchley had already been considered as a new town in this <b>first</b> <b>wave,</b> and in the 1950s the London County Council had constructed overspill housing for several London boroughs there.|$|E

5|$|Ivry {{received}} {{the green light}} at 10:00 AM to execute the operation, but by then he had postponed the attack until 2:00 PM. At 1:30 PM, Eitan ordered Ivry to strike, and the Israeli aircraft took off in pairs. The <b>first</b> <b>wave</b> {{was made up of}} 96 F-15s and F-16s. The second wave which attacked the SAM batteries at 3:50 PM was made up of 92 aircraft. When the attack was launched, the Syrians ordered their combat air patrols to return to base and land.|$|E
5|$|McGill University {{played a}} {{meaningful}} {{role in the}} Great War. Many students and alumni enlisted in the <b>first</b> <b>wave</b> of patriotic fervor that swept the nation in 1914, but {{in the spring of}} 1915 — after the <b>first</b> <b>wave</b> of heavy Canadian casualties at Ypres — Hamilton Gault, the founder of the Canadian regiment and a wealthy Montreal businessman, was faced with a desperate shortage of troops. When he reached out to his friends at home for support, over two hundred were commissioned from the ranks, and many more would serve as soldiers throughout the war. On their return to Canada after the war, Major George McDonald and Major George Currie formed the accounting firm McDonald Currie, which later became {{one of the founders of}} Price Waterhouse Coopers. Captain Percival Molson was killed in action in July 1917. Percival Molson Memorial Stadium at McGill is named in his honour.|$|E
5|$|Of {{the nine}} {{companies}} {{landing in the}} <b>first</b> <b>wave,</b> only Company A of the 116th RCT at Dog Green and the Rangers to their right landed where intended. E/116, aiming for Easy Green, ended up scattered across the two beaches of the 16th RCT area. G/116, aiming for Dog White, opened up a 1,000-yard (900m) gap between themselves and A/116 to their right when they landed at Easy Green instead. I/16 drifted so far east it did not land for another hour and a half.|$|E

5|$|Sentries did detect boats {{moving along}} the river that morning, but they were expecting a French supply convoy to pass that night—a plan that had been changed without Vergor being notified. When the boats, loaded with the <b>first</b> <b>wave</b> lof British troops, were {{challenge}}d, a French-speaking officer, either a Captain Fraser or Captain Donald McDonald of the 78th Fraser Highlanders, was able to answer the challenge in excellent French, allaying suspicion.|$|E
5|$|Survivors of C company 2nd Rangers in the <b>first</b> <b>wave</b> {{landed on}} Dog Green around 06:45; by 07:30, they had scaled the cliffs near Dog Green and the Vierville draw.

5|$|The French {{position}} {{was such that}} they were able to lay down withering fire on the British forces as they advanced, and the abatis (a word that shares derivation with abattoir, or slaughterhouse) rapidly became a killing field. By about 2 pm, it was clear that the <b>first</b> <b>wave</b> of attack had failed. Montcalm was active on the battlefield, having removed his coat, and was moving among his men, giving encouragement and making sure all of their needs were being met. Abercrombie, who was reported by early historians like Francis Parkman and Thomas Mante to be at the sawmill (and thus well away from the action), was reported by his aide, James Abercrombie, to be near the rear of the lines by the La Chute River during much of the battle, and to have approached the front of the French lines at one point early in the battle. It is uncertain why, after the <b>first</b> <b>wave</b> of attack failed, Abercrombie persisted in ordering further attacks. Writing in his own defense, he later claimed that he was relying on Clerk's assessment that the works could be easily taken; this was clearly refuted by the failure of the first charge.|$|E

5|$|The {{detachment}} from No. 3 Commando went ashore in the <b>first</b> <b>wave,</b> securing a bridgehead {{through which the}} rest of the force proceeded to advance. By 08:00 on 3 October Termoli had been captured, although counterattacks continued until early on 6 October. Shortly after they received orders to return to the United Kingdom in order to prepare for the invasion of Normandy.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>wave</b> of the Muslim conquests {{ended with}} the siege of Constantinople in 718, and {{the border between the}} two empires became {{stabilized}} along the mountains of eastern Anatolia. Raids and counter-raids continued on both sides and became almost ritualized, but the prospect of outright conquest of Byzantium by the Caliphate receded. This led to far more regular, and often friendly, diplomatic contacts, as well as a reciprocal recognition of the two empires.|$|E
