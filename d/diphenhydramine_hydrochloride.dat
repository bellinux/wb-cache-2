40|$|The {{lyophilized}} wafer developed {{throughout this}} review {{is an effective}} and versatile drug delivery system for oromucosal application. This has been established from the extensive physicochemical and physic mechanical profiling conducted.

Suitable excipient and polymer combinations were established which allowed for the development of rapidly disintegrating and prolonged release wafer systems. The wafer system containing HPC, lactose, mannitol and glycine had the ability to disintegrate within 30 seconds. The modified wafer system, consisting of pectin cross linked with zinc ions serving as the drug reservoir, and mucoadhesive polymer combination of pectin, carmellose and gelatin, provided effective release of model drug <b>diphenhydramine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> over approximately six hours. The modification of this technology to provide a prolonged release mucoadhesive system seems promising.

40|$|Purpose. It {{has been}} {{confirmed}} that inflammatory cytokines {{are involved in the}} progression of pterygium. Histamine can enhance proliferation and migration of many cells. Therefore, we intend to investigate the proliferative and migratory effects of histamine on primary culture of human pterygium fibroblasts (HPFs). Methods. Pterygium and conjunctiva samples were obtained from surgery, and toluidine blue staining was used to identify mast cells. 3 -[4, 5 -Dimethylthiazol- 2 -yl]- 2, 5 -diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) was performed to evaluate the proliferative rate of HPFs and human conjunctival fibroblasts (HCFs); ki 67 expression was also measured by immunofluorescence analysis. Histamine receptor- 1 (H 1 R) antagonist (<b>Diphenhydramine</b> <b>Hydrochloride)</b> and histamine receptor- 2 (H 2 R) antagonist (Nizatidine) were added to figure out which receptor was involved. Wound healing model was used to evaluate the migratory ability of HPFs. Results. The numbers of total mast cells and degranulated mast cells were both higher in pterygium than in conjunctiva. Histamine had a proliferative effect on both HPFs and HCFs, the effective concentration (10 [*]μmol/L) on HPFs was lower than on HCFs (100 [*]μmol/L), and the effect could be blocked by H 1 R antagonist.

Furthermore, the characterization studies indicated that Fe-Co oxides were highly dispersed {{on the surface of}} mesoporous zirconia with multivalent oxidation states. The interfacial electron transfer process was greatly enhanced due to the presence of two redox couples (Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + and Co 2 +/Co 3 +) in Fe-Co/ZrO 2, which caused the higher catalytic reactivity for ozone decomposition into (OH) -O-aEuro cent radicals, leading to the efficient removal of toxic pollutants in aqueous solution. The catalytic mechanism of pollutants degradation over Fe-Co/ZrO 2 with ozone was proposed on the basis of all information obtained under different experimental conditions. The multivalent oxidation states, high dispersion and the synergistic effect of Fe-Co oxides in Fe-Co/ZrO 2 enhanced the interfacial electron transfer process, which caused the higher catalytic reactivity for the degradation of toxic pollutants in aqueous solution...|$|E

The matrices were prepared by direct compression of Methocel K 4 M (HPMC) or Ethocel 7 FP (EC) polymeric matrix formers and contained <b>diphenhydramine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> as a model drug. The addition of Dow 88 to the matrices decreased matrix hardness and increased thickness, diameter, and friability. In contrast, the addition of Am 64 increased matrix hardness and maintained the original thickness, diameter, and friability. In deionized water, both resins lowered drug release from HPMC-based matrices by virtue of the gelation property of matrix former and the drug exchange property of embedded resin, in other words in situ resinate formation. Dow 88 strongly dissociated and lowered the drug release {{to a greater extent than}} Am 64, which was weakly dissociated. However, Am 64 could retard drug release under simulated gastrointestinal conditions.

Kollicoat SR 30 D premixed with a selected plasticizer (10 % wt/wt propylene glycol, 2. 5 % triethyl citrate, or 2. 5 % dibutyl sebacute), talc, and red # 30 lake dye was coated onto the drug beads in an Aeromatic Strea I fluid-bed drier with a Wurster insert using bottom spray. With propylene glycol as the plasticizer, increases in polymer coating level retarded drug release from beads in a stepwise fashion along with apparent permeability, indicating a consistent release mechanisms. Stability studies at 40 °C/ 75 % RH revealed gradual decreases in dissolution rate, and additional curing studies further confirmed the dependence of release kinetics on curing condition. Furthermore, the type of plasticizer was found to play a key role. Unplasticized formulations exhibited the fastest dissolution, followed by formulations plasticized with triethyl citrate, propylene glycol, and dibutyl sebacate. All 4 formulations (unplasticized and plasticized), nevertheless, revealed a marked difference between uncured and cured dissolution profiles.

The dose of indomethacin was 75 mg (sustained release capsules) taken 12 and 24 hours before and 50 mg taken one hour before a two hour histamine infusion test. Indomethacin enhanced basal gastric secretion from 3. 5 +/- 0. 5 to 6. 4 +/- 0. 6 mmol/h (p less than 0. 01) and histamine stimulated secretion from 48 +/- 6 to 62 +/- 5 mmol/ 2 h (p less than 0. 05). Indomethacin significantly inhibited systemic prostaglandin biosynthesis as measured by urinary excretion (87 +/- 12 vs 41 +/- 6 ng PGE/g creatinine/h) and the drug increased platelet aggregation time two, five, and six fold, respectively, induced by ADP, collagen, and adrenaline. The data indicate that therapeutic doses of indomethacin augmented basal and secretagogue stimulated gastric acid secretion in control subjects. The enhancement of gastric acid secretion by indomethacin may be because of reduced levels of endogenous prostaglandins.

Beer’s law was obeyed with a good correlation coefficient (0. 9982 – 0. 9993) in the concentration ranges 0. 5 – 3, 2. 0 – 16, 2. 0 – 10 and 1. 0 – 10 μgml− 1 for PB, EBT, MO and BCP methods, respectively. The composition ratio of the ion-association complexes {{was found to be}} 1 : 1 in all cases as established by Job’s method. The conditional stability constant (Kf) and the free energy changes (ΔG°) were determined for all complexes formed. The proposed method was successfully applied for the determination of DPH in tablets and human urine with good accuracy and precision. Statistical comparison of the results with those obtained by the official method showed good agreement and indicated no significant difference in accuracy and precision...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a rapid and efficient Capillary Zone Electrophoresis (CZE) method for Quality Control analysis of pharmaceutical preparations containing antihistamines, decongestants, anticholinergic remedies and preservatives. Active ingredients of interest are: ChlorPheniramine Maleate (CPM), <b>DiPhenhydramine</b> <b>Hydrochloride</b> (DPH), Ephedrine hydrochloride (E), Isopropamide Iodide (II), Pheniramine Maleate (PM), Lidocaine hydrochloride (L), Tetracaine hydrochloride (T), Clopamide Hydrochloride (CH), DiHydroErgochristine (DHE), PhenylEphrine hy drochloride (PE) and Acetaminophen (A). Preservatives studied are: MethylParaben (MeP), EthylParaben (EtP), Pro pylParaben (PrP), ButylParaben (BuP), p -HydroxyBenzoic Acid (p- HBA). All these analytes were separated in a single run using 60 mM tetraborate buffer solution (TBS) pH = 9. 2 as a BackGround Electrolyte (BGE) by using an uncoated fused silica capillary of I. D. = 50 m m and applying a voltage of 25 kV {{in the first part of}} the electropheretic run (up to 5. 8 min) and 30 kV for the remaining time. The hydrodynamic pressurization of the inlet vial was 20 psi at 7. 2 min. up to the end of analysis. Total separation time was of 7. 5 min. The method was then successfully validated and applied to the simultaneous determination of active ingredients and preservatives. Good repeatability, linearity, and sensitivity were demonstrated. Precision of migration time (t m) was RSD% c) was RSD% 2 1. 000. LOD and LOQ, accuracy (recovery) and ruggedness were evaluated for each analyte demonstrating the good reliability of the method. Analyses of some pharmaceutical real samples were performed. </p...|$|E
40|$|Background: Mast cell-derived {{histamine}} {{is known}} to act on dermal fi broblasts and contribute to formation of an intractable chronic allergic dermatitis. Although this fi brotic event may also occur in other organs such as the nasal mucosa, no direct evidence has been reported as to whether responsiveness to histamine by fi broblasts derived from different organs is of the same intensity. Furthermore, while type 1 histamine receptor (H 1 R) blockers {{have been shown to}} be effective for alleviation of the symptoms of allergic diseases, their ability to affect histamine-induced tissue remodeling has not yet been clarifi ed. Objective: Our aim was to study the effect of H 1 R-blockers on histamine-induced tissue remodeling. Methods: A macroarray assay was used for a comprehensive analysis of histamine–induced gene expression by normal human fi broblasts. Fibroblasts derived from skin or nasal mucosa were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of histamine, and the synthesis of type 1 collagen was measured by means of semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. To determine the effect of H 1 R blockers, <b>diphenhydramine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> and emedastine difumarate were investigated in this assay. Results: Histamine induced expression of various kinds of fi brogenic molecules in fi broblasts. Increased type 1 collagen expression was observed in fi broblasts treated with high-dose (0. 1 mM to 1 µM) and low-dose (1 pM) histamine. This histamine-induced type 1 collagen synthesis was effectively diminished by emedastine difumarate. While organ specifi city seems to be involved, emedastine difumarate i...|$|E
40|$|This {{work was}} aimed at {{evaluating}} {{the effect of a}} pharmaceutical cationic exchange resin (Amberlite IRP- 69) on the properties of controlled release matrices using Methocel K 4 M (HPMC) or Ethocel 7 cP (EC) as matrix formers. <b>Diphenhydramine</b> <b>hydrochloride</b> (DPH), which was cationic and water soluble, was chosen as a model drug. HPMC- and EC-based matrices with varying amounts (0 – 40 %w/w) of resin incorporation were prepared by a direct compression. Matrix properties including diameter, thickness, hardness, friability, surface morphology and drug release were evaluated. The obtained matrices were comparable in diameter and thickness regardless of the amount of resin incorporation. Increasing the incorporated resin decreased the hardness of HPMC- and EC-based matrices, correlating with the degree of rupturing on the matrix surfaces. The friability of HPMC-based matrices increased with increasing the incorporated resin, corresponding to their decreased hardness. In contrast, the EC-based matrices showed no significant change in friability in spite of decreasing hardness. The incorporated resin differently influenced DPH release from HPMC- and EC-based matrices in deionized water. The resin further retarded DPH release from HPMC-based matrices due to the gelling property of HPMC and the ion exchange property of the resin. In contrast, the release from EC-based matrices initially increased because of the disintegrating property of the resin, but thereafter declined due to the complex formation between released drug and dispersed resin via the ion exchange process. The release in ionic solutions was also described. In conclusion, the incorporated resin could alter the release and physical properties of matrices...|$|E
40|$|Histamine has {{positive}} inotropic and chronotropic {{effects on}} the heart which are not abolished by beta adrenergic-blocking agents. Since the positive inotropic and chronotropic effects of other hormones on the heart {{are thought to be}} mediated by cyclic 3 ′, 5 ′-AMP, we examined the effect of histamine on adenyl cyclase in particulate preparations of guinea pig, cat, and human myocardium. Histamine at the peak of its dose-response curve, 3 × 10 - 4 moles/liter, produced approximately a 300 % increase in cyclic 3 ′, 5 ′-AMP accumulation in the guinea pig, 60 % in the cat, and 90 % in the human heart particles. Half-maximal activity for the histamine mediated activation of adenyl cyclase in the guinea pig was 9 × 10 - 6 moles/liter, almost identical with that observed for norepinephrine in the same preparation. DL-Propranolol, 1 × 10 - 5 moles/liter, did not abolish the activation of adenyl cyclase produced by histamine but did abolish the activation produced by norepinephrine. In contrast, <b>diphenhydramine</b> <b>hydrochloride,</b> Benadryl, 8 × 10 - 5 moles/liter, abolished the activation of adenyl cyclase by histamine but not that produced by norepinephrine. These data suggest that {{there are at least two}} receptor sites in guinea pig heart mediating the activation of adenyl cyclase, one responsive to histamine, the other to norepinephrine. In addition, combined maximal doses of histamine and norepinephrine produced completely additive {{effects on the}} activation of adenyl cyclase, which suggests that at least two separate adenyl cyclase systems are present in the heart, each responsive to one of these hormones. However, definitive proof would require physical separation of the two enzymes...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} whether charge {{sites in the}} walls of the microvasculature {{may play a role in}} maintaining the impermeability of the nonrenal capillaries to albumin. All experiments were performed in nephrectomized rats, studied in the awake state. The intravenous injection of protamine sulfate (4 mg/ 100 g body wt dissolved in 0. 9 % saline) was followed by a mean increase of 29. 1 % in hematocrit and a decrease of 28. 4 % in plasma albumin concentration over a 10 -min period, indicating a significant 50 - 60 % loss of albumin from the vascular space; a finding confirmed by studies using exogenous 125 I-labeled albumin. Changes persisted for the remaining 80 min of observation, and could be reproduced by the injection of two other polycations, hexadimethrine and poly-l-lysine. These effects were not prevented by the antihistamine <b>diphenhydramine</b> <b>hydrochloride.</b> In contrast to 125 I-labeled albumin, 14 C-labeled neutral dextran of comparable size was not confined to the vascular space; its apparent volume of distribution progressively increased during the 90 min of observation. Intravenous injection of protamine sulfate was followed by a significantly smaller loss of 14 C-dextran (36. 5 %) than albumin (59. 1 %) from the vascular space (P less than 0. 01). Protamine sulfate could not be demonstrated to result in any changes in the physicochemical characteristics of albumin. These observations suggest that the negative charge sites present in nonglomerular capillary walls have functions similar to equivalent sites present in the glomerular capillaries. Thus, charge sites could contribute to the low permeability of the microvasculature to negatively charged macromolecules such as albumin. This may be an important mechanism for retaining albumin in the vascular space and preventing edema formation in health...|$|E
