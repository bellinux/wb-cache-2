5|$|Gorbachev began {{a period}} of {{internal}} <b>economic</b> <b>restructuring,</b> known as perestroika, and agreed {{to a series of}} summits with the American president. Matlock was instrumental in preparing Reagan for his first summit with Gorbachev, arranging for specialists within the government to write a “Soviet Union 101” course of 21 papers on Russia for Reagan to study. Matlock also participated in a mock summit, playing the role of Gorbachev, allowing Reagan to practice the encounter in advance.|$|E
5|$|In {{her book}} The Shock Doctrine, author and social activist Naomi Klein criticized Friedman's {{economic}} liberalism, identifying {{it with the}} principles that guided the <b>economic</b> <b>restructuring</b> that followed the military coups {{in countries such as}} Chile and Argentina. Based on their assessments {{of the extent to which}} what she describes as neoliberal policies contributed to income disparities and inequality, both Klein and Noam Chomsky have suggested that the primary role of what they describe as neoliberalism was as an ideological cover for capital accumulation by multinational corporations.|$|E
5|$|Gorbachev {{set aside}} 5 billion rubles (about $8 billion U.S. dollars) in {{funds for a}} start on what would likely be a {{recovery}} cost that would exceed the cleanup bill for the 1986 nuclear and radiation accident in Ukraine. While foreign doctors did assist with the Chernobyl incident, the Soviet relief effort after the earthquake was augmented by the largest foreign cooperation since World War II. That deluge of western aid was a byproduct of the disaster that {{may have had a}} positive effect on Soviet Union–United States relations. The cost of rebuilding would be a severe obstacle for Perestroika, Gorbachev's plan for <b>economic</b> <b>restructuring.</b> Another adverse effect of the disaster was that the Armenians were already distrustful of Gorbachev's dismissal of their claims to the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh, which the Armenians had been contesting with neighboring Azerbaijan.|$|E

5|$|Nationwide strikes {{broke out}} {{in the spring and summer}} of 1988. They were much weaker than the strikes of 1980 and were {{discontinued}} after the intervention by Wałęsa, who secured the regime's commitment to begin negotiations with the opposition. The strikes were the last act of active political involvement of the working class in the history of People's Poland and were led by young workers, not connected to Solidarity veterans and opposed to socially harmful consequences of the <b>economic</b> <b>restructuring</b> in progress at that time. According to the researcher Maciej Gdula, the political activity that followed was conducted exclusively by the elites. It was neither inspired by nor consulted with any mass social organization or movement, as the opposition leading circles freed themselves from their strong in the past commitment to the welfare of working people. No longer secure as undisputed leaders, Polish dissidents of the KOR-Solidarity generations were eager to bargain with the weakened regime whose economic goals they now shared.|$|E
25|$|The late 1970s and the 1980s again saw {{a period}} of {{economic}} hardship hit the city as several major employers closed or restructured. The Eatons catalogue division closed in 1976 and CN closed its locomotive shops facility in 1988, throwing thousands {{out of work and}} forcing the federal and provincial governments to step in with <b>economic</b> <b>restructuring</b> packages to diversify the Moncton economy. CFB Moncton was also closed at about this time due to defence cutbacks resulting {{from the end of the}} Cold War.

40|$|A paper “Suzhi (Quality) Discourse and Laid-off Workers: The Role of Trade Unions in Post-Maoist China” was {{presented}} on June 18. (See attached schedule). Feedback {{inspired me to}} continue working on and revising the paper. More specifically, I plan to hire a research assistant in Beijing, China to verify my sources, and conduct interviews {{with a number of}} laid-off workers based on the questionnaire I provided. The final version of the paper will be submitted to a journal for publication. In addition to presenting the paper, I attended a number of sessions on China and other Asian countries, and met with scholars from the USA and countries across the world. Over the last 20 years, “suzhi” discourse pervaded government speeches, official media, and mainstream publications across China. This phenomenon attracted attention of western scholars, and their comments are mainly negative. A number of China observers see the promotion of “suzhi” a neoliberal governmentality, arguing that the emphasis of rural migrants’ lack of Suzhi has allowed the party-state to conceal the fact that China’s economic success was achieved at the expense of interior rural areas that supply cheap resources and labor. Some others focusing on women and minority groups indicate that the significant feature of “suzhi” discussion is its obsession with improving people’s quality, while neglecting the structural inequities created by the development strategies of the post-Maoist state. Inspired by western scholarship on Suzhi, this paper looks at Chinese trade unions’ activities in face of the massive layoffs caused by the <b>economic</b> <b>restructure</b> during the late 1990 s. Largely endorsing government policy of development, the All China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) viewed unemployment as a normal consequence of market economy, a price that workers had to pay in order for the country’s economy continuing to grow rapidly. Unable to protect workers from unemployment and ineffective in bargaining better compensation deals for the layoffs, ACFTU and its grass root branches instead focus on running training sessions to enhance laid off workers’ skills as well as “moral values”. Drawing upon archive research of official documents, journals and newspapers issued by the ACFTU, this paper attempts to reveal how the trade unions had greatly enhanced its educational function in the context of <b>economic</b> <b>restructure</b> in the late 1990 s. Trying to help workers improve their “suzhi” and adapt to the market economy, ACFTU was eager to placate discontented workers and prevent or defuse confrontational labor actions, making contributions to social harmony, the top priority of the party-state...|$|R
25|$|Annual {{per capita}} {{emissions}} in the industrialized countries are typically as much as ten times the average in developing countries. Due to China's fast economic development, its annual per capita emissions are quickly approaching the levels {{of those in the}} Annex I group of the Kyoto Protocol (i.e., the developed countries excluding the USA). Other countries with fast growing emissions are South Korea, Iran, and Australia (which apart from the oil rich Persian Gulf states, now has the highest percapita emission rate in the world). On the other hand, annual per capita emissions of the EU-15 and the USA are gradually decreasing over time. Emissions in Russia and Ukraine have decreased fastest since 1990 due to <b>economic</b> <b>restructuring</b> in these countries.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the {{economic}} booms of the 1960s and 1970s, when increasing exports played the {{key role in}} economic expansion, domestic demand propelled the Japanese economy in the late 1980s. This development involved fundamental <b>economic</b> <b>restructuring,</b> moving from dependence on exports to reliance on domestic demand. The boom that started in 1986 was generated by the decisions of companies to increase private plant and equipment spending and of consumers {{to go on a}} buying spree. Japan's imports grew at a faster rate than exports. Japanese post-war technological research was carried out for the sake of economic growth rather than military development. The growth in high-technology industries in the 1980s resulted from heightened domestic demand for high-technology products such as electronics, and for higher living, housing, and environmental standards; better medical care and more welfare; expanded leisure-time facilities; and improved ways to accommodate a rapidly aging society.|$|E
