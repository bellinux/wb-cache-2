40|$|Abstract Background For {{holometabolous}} insects {{there has}} been an explosion of proteomic and peptidomic information thanks to large genome sequencing projects. <b>Heterometabolous</b> insects, although comprising many important species, have been far less studied. The migratory locust Locusta migratoria, a <b>heterometabolous</b> insect, {{is one of the most}} infamous agricultural pests. They undergo a well-known and profound phase transition from the relatively harmless solitary form to a ferocious gregarious form. The underlying regulatory mechanisms of this phase transition are not fully understood, but it is undoubtedly that neuropeptides are involved. However, neuropeptide research in locusts is hampered by the absence of genomic information. Results Recently, EST (Expressed Sequence Tag) databases from Locusta migratoria were constructed. Using bioinformatical tools, we searched these EST databases specifically for neuropeptide precursors. Based on known locust neuropeptide sequences, we confirmed the sequence of several previously identified neuropeptide precursors (i. e. pacifastin-related peptides), which consolidated our method. In addition, we found two novel neuroparsin precursors and annotated the hitherto unknown tachykinin precursor. Besides one of the known tachykinin peptides, this EST contained an additional tachykinin-like sequence. Using neuropeptide precursors from Drosophila melanogaster as a query, we succeeded in annotating the Locusta neuropeptide F, allatostatin-C and ecdysis-triggering hormone precursor, which until now had not been identified in locusts or in any other <b>heterometabolous</b> insect. For the tachykinin precursor, the ecdysis-triggering hormone precursor and the allatostatin-C precursor, translation of the predicted neuropeptides in neural tissues was confirmed with mass spectrometric techniques. Conclusion In this study we describe the annotation of 6 novel neuropeptide precursors and the neuropeptides they encode from the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria. By combining the manual annotation of neuropeptides with experimental evidence provided by mass spectrometry, we demonstrate that the genes are not only transcribed but also translated into precursor proteins. In addition, we show which neuropeptides are cleaved from these precursor proteins and how they are post-translationally modified. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{last decade}} {{there has been}} an {{explosion}} of peptidomic information thanks to large genome sequencing projects. For invertebrate neuropeptides, mainly holometabolous insects (D. melanogaster, A. mellifera, …) and the nematode C. elegans have been studied. <b>Heterometabolous</b> insects, although comprising many economically important species, have been far less studied. The migratory locust, for example, {{is one of the most}} infamous agricultural pests. However, neuropeptide research is hampered by the absence of genomic information. Considering the locust’s genome size (30 x genome of D. melanogaster) this is not likely to change in the near future. Fortunately Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) can compensate for the lack of genomic information. Recently, EST databases were constructed for L. migratoria. Using bioinformatical tools, we screened these databases for neuropeptide precursors. Several previously identified neuropeptide precursors, two novel neuroparsin precursors and the hitherto unknown tachykinin precursor, which yielded an additional TK-like sequence, were annotated. Using neuropeptide precursors from D. melanogaster as a query, we succeeded in annotating the NPF, AST-C and ETH precursor, which until now had not been identified in any <b>heterometabolous</b> insect. Translation of the predicted neuropeptides in neural tissues was confirmed with mass spectrometric techniques for the TK-, ETH- and AST-C precursor. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Antiparasitic {{disinfection}} manifests unjustifiable deficiencies to date (Hiepe, 2010). Though DVG guidelines specify {{methods for}} testing disinfectants on protozoa and helminths in the veterinary medical parasitary field, however, test procedures on malignant arthropods are not included. In this work, M. domestica {{was selected for}} {{the investigation of the}} disin-fectant efficacy test for surface disinfection being a potential representative of malignant arthropods, Victor (1999) and Mielke et al. (2001) had conducted preliminary investigations on M. domestica using a registered cresol-based test preparation. The aim of my own investigations was to test the suitability of this species as an indicator organism. For this purpose, initially M. domestica were bred. All M. domestica developmental stages (eggs, larvae I, larvae II, larvae III, pupae, imagines) were included in both, the procedural execution and the efficacy tests. After presenting an analysis of the publications on disinfection and M. domestica, the breeding of the housefly and the execution of the developed test procedures were described in detail. The efficacy tests were carried out using two different test preparations with different active substances. Test preparation 1 (active substances: o-hydroxydiphenyl-fatty acid-eutectic, peracetic acid) is found in the 13 th list of disinfectants by DVG (N. N., 2011 / 1) (Spectrum of efficacy: bactericidal, tuberculocidal, fungicidal, virucidal, antiparasitary (worm eggs, coccidia)). Test preparation 2 (Active substances: glutaraldehyde, glyoxal, formaldehyde, benzalkonium-chloride, didecyl-dimethylammonium-chloride) is not listed by DVG, but by DGHM and by RKI (Spectrum of efficacy: bactericidal, tuberculocidal, sporicidal, fungicidal, virus inactivating). The disinfectant efficacy tests were performed at every M. domestica stage in the suspension test and the germ carrier test as well; only the adult house flies were exclusively examined in the suspension test. The germ carrier tests were performed with two different materials – poplar and the back side of tiles. The test procedures and the germ carriers used both proved to be suited for the disinfectant testing. However, the time and labour required for examining certain developmental stages of M. domestica were adversely affected by their ability to move. As expected, M. domestica exhibited different susceptibilities to the tested active agents at the different stages of their development. It could be proven that M. domestica -eggs is the only developmental stage that did not meet the requirements by DVG (N. N., 2007) specified for A. suum - eggs in comparison, neither in the suspension tests nor in the germ carrier tests of the two test preparations. Thus the M. domestica - egg exhibited the lowest overall susceptibility to the two test preparations (table 1. 1 - 1. 3, table 2. 1 - 2. 3). The test procedures on M. domestica - eggs and - pupae are recommended as suitable. The consideration of tenacity as well as the execution of the test procedures resulted in this finding. Efficacy tests on holometabolous malignant arthropods should be performed in 2 steps. Step 1 : Test on pupae, step 2 : Test on eggs, whereas step 2 should only be performed, if step 1 brought positive findings. The test on <b>heterometabolous</b> insects is only recommended at one developmental stage, the egg. Considering the lower overall efficacy obtained, the material property and seen from an ecological and economic perspective the germ carrier poplar is to be preferred to the back side of tiles. The established breeding of M. domestica {{plays a major role in}} deciding for an indicator organism of malignant arthropods. Own investigations show that the cosmopolite M. domestica is suited as an indicator for disinfectant efficacy tests on malignant arthropods (specifically eggs and pupae of holometabola) in the suspension test and in the germ carrier test as well...|$|E
