5|$|Film {{historian}} Howard Hughes suggests that, {{despite the}} <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large budget {{as a result}} of an international cast, as well as elaborate set and costume designs, there are several aspects that suggest otherwise. These include several continuity errors and revealing mistakes present throughout the film, and a variance in the quality of the film stock. In comparison to the Technicolor/Techniscope presentation most Spaghetti Westerns were filmed in, The Great Silence was filmed in the standard European widescreen format and printed in Eastmancolor.|$|E
5|$|Medical {{diagnosis}} of the onset of HD can be made following the appearance of physical symptoms specific to the disease. Genetic testing {{can be used to}} confirm a physical diagnosis if there is no family history of HD. Even before the onset of symptoms, genetic testing can confirm if an individual or embryo carries an expanded copy of the trinucleotide repeat in the HTT gene that causes the disease. Genetic counseling is available to provide advice and guidance throughout the testing procedure, and on the <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> confirmed diagnosis. These implications include the impact on an individual's psychology, career, family planning decisions, relatives and relationships. Despite the availability of pre-symptomatic testing, only 5% of those at risk of inheriting HD choose to do so.|$|E

5|$|In Polistes exclamans, equal {{sex ratio}} is {{obtained}} when only 46.3% of investment {{is devoted to}} females as female wasps are 1.16 times larger than male wasps. In a study done by Strassmann, {{it was found that}} sexual investment is female biased, especially during years of high predation and when nests are generally less successful. It has been seen that in Polistes exclamans, females are produced before males. This female investment bias may result from the ability of females to become either a worker or a reproductive (this is more adaptive for the nest as it gives the nest increased flexibility compared to that of males and may be important for overall nest success) or because females provide the colony with greater nest defense. Furthermore, even when the original queen is no longer present, the sexual investment is still biased towards females, which is not expected given the genetic <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new queen.|$|E

25|$|Meanwhile, James Campbell was {{frustrated}} {{in his efforts}} to create what might have been the nation's second largest steel corporation. In 1931, he attempted to merge the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Company with Bethlehem Steel, a move that was bitterly, and successfully, opposed by other local industrialists. Opponents of the merger were backed financially by Cyrus S. Eaton, founder of Republic Steel, who feared the <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> strengthened Bethlehem Steel.|$|E

25|$|Construction drafts for a fixed link were {{presented}} {{as early as}} the 1850s, with several suggestions appearing in the following decades. The Danish State Railways, responsible for the ferry service, presented plans for a bridge in 1934. The concepts of bridges over Øresund (152m DKK) and Storebælt (257m DKK) were calculated around 1936. In 1948, the Ministry for Public Works (now the Ministry of Transport) established a commission to investigate the <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fixed link.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{widespread}} belief, {{there is}} no empirical knowledge concerning extraterrestrial life forms and civilizations. The <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> detection of extraterrestrial life would vary greatly depending {{on the nature of}} that life, its location, and how human society reacts. Because of this lack of certainty, PDPs consider a variety of scenarios and the appropriate reactions. The formulation of a cohesive plan for a response to the detection of ETI would involve the development of scenario-contingent strategies for managing the discovery and its consequences.|$|E

5000|$|When {{referring}} to inanimate objects, estar {{is used to}} tell about non-permanent conditions when there is <b>an</b> <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> finished change <b>of</b> state, <b>an</b> <b>implication</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> state in <b>a</b> known point <b>of</b> <b>an</b> evolution, or a temporal condition {{which is expected to}} change. In some way, estar introduces an adverbial sense to adjectives (for example, la sopa està calenta, [...] "the soup is hot", as in [...] "it has come to be hot.") Thus, both using ser and estar is correct in many contexts, but there is a difference in nuance.|$|R

25|$|However, as {{with all}} voting systems, once PR-STV is {{understood}} there remain {{a number of areas}} of controversy surrounding its use. In particular, arguments for and against proportional representation in general are frequently referenced in debates among electorates considering STV, however the specific <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> particular STV system can be examined as well. Most of the arguments for and against STV and proportional representation in general are based around the expected outcomes of the alternative proposed system and not on the system itself.|$|E
25|$|As he {{developed}} his work throughout the 1980s, {{he moved from}} economic theory to mediation and mass communication. Although retaining his interest in Saussurean semiotics and the logic of symbolic exchange (as influenced by anthropologist Marcel Mauss), Baudrillard {{turned his attention to}} the work of Marshall McLuhan, developing ideas about how the nature of social relations is determined by the forms of communication that a society employs. In so doing, Baudrillard progressed beyond both Saussure's and Roland Barthes's formal semiology to consider the <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> historically understood version of structural semiology.|$|E

If the deceased brother was the firstborn son, his inheritance was a double share. However, if the deceased brother were childless, the living brother would be entitled to inherit an increased share; or if he is the oldest surviving son he would be entitled to a double share of the increased share.|$|E

25|$|David Cass was outspoken about {{academic}} and personal freedom. In 1994 he {{became involved in}} an administrative dispute with the University of Pennsylvania over the <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> consensual faculty-student relationship. At this time he had a consensual relationship with a then-graduate student. When a university policy on faculty-student relationships was adopted Cass was denied the appointment as Chair of the graduate program of the Department of Economics because of this relationship. As the graduate student in question graduated before the planned appointment of Cass as Chair of the department, the timeline of the administrative action rendered the initial objection moot.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} of whether P equals NP {{is one of the}} most important open questions in theoretical computer science because of the wide <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> solution. If the answer is yes, many important problems can be shown to have more efficient solutions. These include various types of integer programming problems in operations research, many problems in logistics, protein structure prediction in biology, and the ability to find formal proofs of pure mathematics theorems. The P versus NP problem is one of the Millennium Prize Problems proposed by the Clay Mathematics Institute. There is a US$1,000,000 prize for resolving the problem.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} types of LCA. Attributional LCAs seek to {{establish}} (or attribute) the burdens associated with the production and use of a product, or with a specific service or process, {{at a point in}} time (typically the recent past). Consequential LCAs seek to identify the environmental consequences of a decision or a proposed change in a system under study (oriented to the future), which means that market and economic <b>implications</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> decision may have to be taken into account. Social LCA is under development as a different approach to life cycle thinking intended to assess social implications or potential impacts. Social LCA should be considered as an approach that is complementary to environmental LCA.|$|E
