5|$|Ron Perranoski {{entered as}} the new pitcher for the seventh, Camilli took his place {{as the new}} catcher, and Ron Fairly {{replaced}} Wally Moon at first base. Burright became the new second baseman, replacing Gilliam who moved to third base while the previous third baseman, Tommy Davis, moved to center field. Perranoski allowed singles to Orsino and Pagán after a ground out by Felipe Alou. The Giants pinch hit Harvey Kuenn for Matty Alou and Bob Nieman for Hiller, but both recorded outs to end {{the top of the}} seventh. Ernie Bowman replaced Nieman at second base for the Giants {{in the bottom of the}} inning and no runs scored in the frame. The Giants continued to hit Perranoski in the top of the eighth, with singles by Davenport and Mays to open the inning. Jack Smith entered in relief but allowed a single to Ed Bailey pinch hitting for Larsen which scored Davenport to cut the Dodgers' lead to 7–6. Mays attempted to advance to third on the play but was called out. The play drew arguments from Mays, Alvin Dark, and third base coach Whitey Lockman as third base umpire Jocko Conlan appeared to call Mays safe before changing it to out. Carl Boles pinch ran for Bailey, and Cepeda reached on an error on <b>his</b> <b>fly</b> ball which allowed Boles to move to third. Stan Williams relieved Smith and walked Felipe Alou to load the bases. Orsino hit a sacrifice fly to tie the game at seven runs apiece and Pagán grounded out to end the inning.|$|E
500|$|... 1900 {{marked the}} {{so-called}} rediscovery of Mendel: Hugo de Vries, Carl Correns, and Erich von Tschermak independently arrived at Mendel's laws (which were not actually present in Mendel's work). Soon after, cytologists (cell biologists) proposed that chromosomes were the hereditary material. Between 1910 and 1915, Thomas Hunt Morgan and the [...] "Drosophilists" [...] in <b>his</b> <b>fly</b> lab forged these two ideas—both controversial—into the [...] "Mendelian-chromosome theory" [...] of heredity. They quantified {{the phenomenon of}} genetic linkage and postulated that genes reside on chromosomes like beads on string; they hypothesized crossing over to explain linkage and constructed genetic maps of the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, which became a widely used model organism.|$|E
500|$|Although The Fly {{character}} was retired after the tour, Bono began to wear tinted glasses, similar to <b>his</b> <b>Fly</b> sunglasses, in most public appearances. The glasses have since become a stylistic trademark of the singer in both his musical and activist roles. The Fly and MacPhisto characters {{appeared in the}} animated music video to U2's 1995 song [...] "Hold Me, Thrill Me, Kiss Me, Kill Me" [...] from the soundtrack to Batman Forever. Author Višnja Cogan wrote that [...] "the video crystallises and concludes the Zoo TV period and the changes that occurred". Director Joel Schumacher attempted to create a role for Bono as MacPhisto in Batman Forever, but both later agreed it was not suitable. Producer Nellee Hooper later told Bono that Zoo TV [...] "ruined irony for everyone".|$|E

500|$|Early {{the next}} morning, Nick fills a jar with 50 dew-heavy {{grasshoppers}} found under a log he names a [...] "grasshopper lodging-house", eats breakfast, drinks sweetened coffee {{and makes a}} sliced onion sandwich. After checking and assembling <b>his</b> <b>fly</b> fishing rod and tying on damp leader line, {{he walks to the}} river with a net hanging from his belt, a sack over his shoulder and the jar of grasshoppers dangling around his neck. Wading in the water, he fishes the shallows; he lands a trout that [...] "was mottled with clear, water-over-gravel color" [...] that he releases. Moving into a pool of deeper water, he hooks a large trout, [...] "as broad as a salmon", which he loses. After a rest, he moves away from the pool to the more shallow center of the river and catches two trout that he stows in his sack. Sitting on a log, smoking a cigarette and eating his onion sandwich, he thinks about fishing the deep water of the swamp, but decides to wait for another day. At the log in the river, he kills, guts and cleans the two trout before returning to camp.|$|E

60|$|Our famous north-country trout stream wound its {{flashing}} and foaming {{way through}} a ravine in the rocky moorland. It was a windy, shadowy evening. A heavily clouded sunset lay low and red in the west. A solitary angler stood casting <b>his</b> <b>fly</b> at a turn in the stream where the backwater lay still and deep under an overhanging bank. A girl (myself) standing on the bank, invisible to the fisherman beneath, waited eagerly to see the trout rise.|$|E

6000|$|On the day {{of their}} arrival, Fred seized his rod, and taking Hans to gaff the fish and show him the river, sallied forth, {{accompanied}} by about a score of natives, chiefly men and boys, who were eager {{to see the new}} style of fishing. They soon came to a fine-looking part of the stream, and Fred put together his rod. He was much amused at the looks of the men when they saw the thin supple point of the rod. They shook their heads gravely, and said, [...] "He cannot hold a big fish with that." [...] They were right so far, but they did not understand the use of the reel and the running line. Presently Fred cast, and almost immediately a large salmon took <b>his</b> <b>fly,</b> the rod bent like a hoop, and the reel whizzed furiously as the line ran out.|$|E
