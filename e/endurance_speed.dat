40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the effects of {{additional}} in-season <b>speed</b> <b>endurance</b> production versus <b>speed</b> <b>endurance</b> maintenance training regimes on performance in competitive male soccer players. In a randomised controlled trial 18 male sub-elite players were exposed to additional <b>speed</b> <b>endurance</b> production (SEP) or <b>speed</b> <b>endurance</b> maintenance (SEM) training (two additional sessions/wk for 4 weeks) during the competitive season. Players performed the Yo-Yo intermittent recovery level 2 test (YYIR 2) and a repeated sprint test (RST) pre- and post-intervention. Yo-Yo IR 2 performance increased (p< 0. 001) by 50 ± 8 % and 26 ± 5 % in SEP and SEM, respectively, with greater (p= 0. 03) improvement in SEP. RST performance improved by 2. 1 ± 0. 3 % and 1. 3 ± 0. 4 % in SEP and SEM, respectively, while the RST fatigue index decreased (4. 4 ± 0. 8 to 3. 4 ± 0. 5 %; p< 0. 04) in SEP only. Peak and average speed during training were higher (p< 0. 001) in SEP than in SEM (24. 5 ± 0. 3 vs 19. 2 ± 0. 3 and 15. 5 ± 0. 1 km·h- 1 vs 9. 4 ± 0. 1 km·h- 1).
