[...] Letters and memoirs from soldiers describing events similar to this do not have credible evidence of Pershing having been personally involved. [...] Similarly, the claim made by Donald Trump during his presidential campaign in February 2016 that Pershing executed 49 [...] "Muslim terrorists" [...] with bullets dipped in pig's blood, then let the 50th go free to spread the word about the religious atrocity, which Trump alluded to again while serving as president in August 2017, has been repeatedly debunked by historians, who find no evidence that such an incident occurred.|$|E
