25|$|Dr. Pedro Beauchamp is {{the first}} Puerto Rican {{specialist}} certified by the American Reproductive Endocrinology and Infertility Board who in 1985 performed the first in vitro fertilization (IVF) technique in Puerto Rico. In 1982, Dr. Beauchamp was responsible and is credited with delivering the first triplets born by <b>in-vitro</b> fertilization in the United States and the first <b>in-vitro</b> baby born in Argentina. His work is known as GIFT (in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer) and TET (Tubal Embryo Transfer). Dr. Beauchamp returned to Puerto Rico in 1985 and established his practice in reproductive endocrinology and infertility {{in the city of}} Bayamón. In 1986, he delivered the first child born from the <b>in-vitro</b> fertilization procedure in all of Puerto Rico at the Regional Hospital of Bayamón.|$|E

A bill granting adoption rights to same-sex parents and carers, as well as <b>in-vitro</b> fertilisation for lesbian relationships, was introduced in Parliament by then opposition Socialist and Left Block parties on 16 January 2015. On 22 January, Parliament rejected the proposals.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{multiple}} births has {{increased over the}} last decade. For example, in Canada between 1979 and 1999, the number of multiple birth babies increased 35%. Before the advent of ovulation-stimulating drugs, triplets were quite rare (approximately 1 in 8000 births) and higher-order births much rarer still. Much of the increase can probably {{be attributed to the}} impact of fertility treatments, such as <b>in-vitro</b> fertilization. Younger patients who undergo treatment with fertility medication containing artificial FSH, followed by intrauterine insemination, are particularly at risk for multiple births of higher order.|$|E
25|$|Pyrazinamide {{was first}} {{discovered}} and patented in 1936 but not used against tuberculosis until 1952. Its discovery as an anti-tubercular agent was remarkable {{since it has}} no activity against tuberculosis <b>in-vitro,</b> due to not being active at a neutral pH, so would ordinarily {{not be expected to}} work in-vivo. However, it was known that nicotinamide had activity against tuberculosis and pyrazinamide was thought to have a similar effect. Experiments in mice at Lederle and Merck confirmed its ability to kill tuberculosis and it was rapidly used in humans.|$|E
25|$|Angiogenesis is a {{physiological}} process involving {{the growth of}} new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels. Under normal physiological conditions angiogenesis is tightly regulated and is controlled by a balance of angiogenic stimulators and angiogenic inhibitors. Tumor growth is dependent upon angiogenesis and during tumor development a sustained production of angiogenic stimulatory factors is required along with {{a reduction in the}} quantity of angiogenic inhibitory factors tumor cells produce. The cleaved and latent form of antithrombin potently inhibit angiogenesis and tumor growth in animal models. The prelatent form of antithrombin has been shown to inhibit angiogenesis <b>in-vitro</b> but to date has not been tested in experimental animal models.|$|E
25|$|By being {{hydrophobic}} and small, or inhibiting astrocyte function, some compounds including certain neurotoxins {{are able}} to penetrate into the brain and induce significant damage. In modern times, scientists and physicians have been presented {{with the challenge of}} identifying and treating neurotoxins, which has resulted in a growing interest in both neurotoxicology research and clinical studies. Though clinical neurotoxicology is largely a burgeoning field, extensive inroads {{have been made in the}} identification of many environmental neurotoxins leading to the classification of 750 to 1000 known potentially neurotoxic compounds. Due to the critical importance of finding neurotoxins in common environments, specific protocols have been developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for testing and determining neurotoxic effects of compounds (USEPA 1998). Additionally, in vitro systems have increased in use as they provide significant improvements over the more common in vivo systems of the past. Examples of improvements include tractable, uniform environments, and the elimination of contaminating effects of systemic metabolism. In vitro systems, however, have presented problems as it has been difficult to properly replicate the complexities of the nervous system, such as the interactions between supporting astrocytes and neurons in creating the BBB. To even further complicate the process of determining neurotoxins when testing <b>in-vitro,</b> neurotoxicity and cytotoxicity may be difficult to distinguish as exposing neurons directly to compounds may not be possible in-vivo, as it is <b>in-vitro.</b> Additionally, the response of cells to chemicals may not accurately convey a distinction between neurotoxins and cytotoxins, as symptoms like oxidative stress or skeletal modifications may occur in response to either.|$|E
25|$|In {{an effort}} to address this complication, neurite outgrowths (either axonal or dendritic) in {{response}} to applied compounds have recently been proposed as a more accurate distinction between true neurotoxins and cytotoxins in an <b>in-vitro</b> testing environment. Due to the significant inaccuracies associated with this process, however, it has been slow in gaining widespread support. Additionally, biochemical mechanisms have become more widely used in neurotoxin testing, such that compounds can be screened for sufficiency to induce cell mechanism interference, like the inhibition of acetylcholinesterase capacity of organophosphates (includes DDT and sarin gas). Though methods of determining neurotoxicity still require significant development, the identification of deleterious compounds and toxin exposure symptoms has undergone significant improvement.|$|E
25|$|Parkinson's {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} disease described by the selective loss of dopaminergic neurons located in the substantia nigra. Today, {{the most commonly used}} drug to combat this disease is levodopa or L-DOPA. This precursor to dopamine can penetrate through the blood–brain barrier, whereas the neurotransmitter dopamine cannot. There has been extensive research to determine whether L-dopa is a better treatment for Parkinson's disease rather than other dopamine agonists. Some believe that the long-term use of L-dopa will compromise neuroprotection and, thus, eventually lead to dopaminergic cell death. Though there has been no proof, in-vivo or <b>in-vitro,</b> some still believe that the long-term use of dopamine agonists is better for the patient.|$|E
25|$|The {{discovery}} of a specific function for DCC {{that seemed to have}} little to do with cell cycle control, the low somatic mutation rate and the absence of cancer predisposition in DCC heterozygotes were fairly discouraging evidence for DCC's putative tumour suppressor status. This caused focus to shift to DCC's role in axon guidance for a time, until one study implicated DCC in regulation of cell death. As the 18q chromosomal deletions were never resolved to be related solely to another gene, DCC was rapidly reaccepted as a candidate. Recent research into the mechanisms of DCC signaling and <b>in-vitro</b> studies of DCC modifications have solidified DCC's tumour suppressor position, and have begun to integrate DCCs divergent functions as both an axon guidance molecule and a tumour suppressor into a single concept.|$|E
25|$|Israel is {{emerging}} as a popular destination for medical tourists. In 2006, 15,000 foreigners travelled to the country for medical procedures, bringing in $40 million of revenue. The advantages of Israel for health tourism include good natural resources; stable, comfortable climate all year round; a progressive medical systems, and scenic locations which have a calming effect on patients. Medical tourists choose Israel for several reasons. Some come from European nations such as Romania where certain procedures are not available. Others come to Israel, most commonly from the United States, because they can receive quality health care {{at a fraction of}} the cost it would be at home, for both surgeries and <b>in-vitro</b> fertilization treatments. Other medical tourists come to Israel to visit the Dead Sea, a world-famous therapeutic resort. The Israel Ministry of Tourism and several professional medical services providers have set out to generate awareness of Israel's medical capabilities.|$|E

25|$|Transformation using {{electroporation}} {{was developed}} in the late 1980s, increasing the efficiency of <b>in-vitro</b> transformation and increasing the number of bacterial strains that could be transformed. Transformation of animal and plant cells was also investigated with the first transgenic mouse being created by injecting a gene for a rat growth hormone into a mouse embryo in 1982. In 1907 a bacterium that caused plant tumors, Agrobacterium tumefaciens, was discovered and in the early 1970s the tumor-inducing agent was found to be a DNA plasmid called the Ti plasmid. By removing the genes in the plasmid that caused the tumor and adding in novel genes, researchers were able to infect plants with A. tumefaciens and let the bacteria insert their chosen DNA into the genomes of the plants. Not all plant cells are susceptible to infection by A. tumefaciens, so other methods were developed, including electroporation and micro-injection. Particle bombardment was made possible with the invention of the Biolistic Particle Delivery System (gene gun) by John Sanford in the 1980s.|$|E
25|$|Jane's {{paternal}} {{grandfather had}} come {{to live in the}} East End of London after escaping the Czarist pogroms when he was 14. He is listed in the 1911 census as Bethnal Green, working as a hairdresser, and eventually went on to have his own company. Jane's father Benjamin qualified at the UCL Medical School in 1938, and joined the medical branch of the RAFVR after the outbreak of war. Commissioned a flying officer on 25 June 1940, he was promoted to war-substantive flight lieutenant on 25 June 1941. During the war, he served in England, Belgium, Italy and South Africa. Ending the war as a squadron leader with a mention in despatches, he relinquished his reserve commission on 8 May 1959, retaining the rank of squadron leader. After the war, Frankenberg continued his career at various London hospitals, including at St Leonard's Hospital, Hackney, the East End Maternity Hospital, the City of London Maternity Hospital and finally at Hillingdon Hospital, for which he designed the maternity unit. A close associate of Patrick Steptoe, he assisted in pioneering discussions on <b>in-vitro</b> fertilisation and also published papers on adolescent and teenage sexual behaviours.|$|E
25|$|Israel is {{a popular}} {{destination}} for medical tourism. Many medical tourists to Israel come from Europe, particularly the former Soviet Union, {{as well as the}} United States, Australia, Cyprus, and South Africa. Medical tourists come to Israel for a variety of surgical procedures and therapies, including bone marrow transplants, heart surgery and catheterization, oncological and neurological treatments, orthopedic procedures, car accident rehabilitation, and <b>in-vitro</b> fertilization. Israel's popularity as a destination for medical tourism stems from its status as a developed country with a high-quality level of medical care, {{while at the same time}} having lower medical costs than many other developed countries. Israel is particularly popular as a destination for bone marrow transplants among Cypriots, as the procedure is not available in Cyprus, and for orthopedic procedures among Americans, as the cost of orthopedic procedures in Israel is about half that of in the United States. Israel is a particularly popular destination for people seeking IFV treatments. Medical tourists in Israel use both public and private hospitals, and all major Israeli hospitals offer medical tourism packages which typically cost far less than comparable procedures than in facilities elsewhere with a similarly high standard of care. In 2014, it was estimated that roughly 50,000 medical tourists came to Israel annually. There are reports that these medical tourists obtain preferential treatment, to the detriment of local patients. In addition, some people come to Israel to visit health resorts at the Dead Sea, and on Lake Kinneret.|$|E
