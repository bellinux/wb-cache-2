40|$|Australian <b>estuaries</b> can be {{classified}} into five groups {{on the basis of}} their hydrology: Mediterranean, Temperate, Transitional, Arid Tropical and Subtropical, and Wet and Dry Tropical and Subtropical.

40|$|Coastal eutrophication, {{defined as}} an {{increase}} in algal biomass (as chlorophyll (Chl)) is of increasing international concern. Although coastal eutrophication will likely increase as coastal populations grow, few models exist to support its management. Lake eutrophication has also long been recognized as an important environmental concern. However, effective lake eutrophication management exists, supported by regression and mass-balance models. Traditionally, these "Vollenweider" models link land-use to Chl via total phosphorus (TP), the nutrient considered to be limiting Chl. However, based on a data set of 63 lakes, Chl was more accurately predicted by models based on land-use than by those based on TP. This result provided the rationale to build Chl:land-use models for <b>estuaries</b> where the Chl:nutrient relations are unclear. Chl:land-use models were developed for 15 <b>estuaries</b> in PEI, 19 <b>estuaries</b> in Finland and 26 US <b>estuaries.</b> Land-use models predicted Chl more accurately than TP in the US <b>estuaries</b> and {{in some of the}} Finnish <b>estuaries.</b> In the Finnish <b>estuaries,</b> Chl was best predicted by a land-use model in <b>estuaries</b> dominated by nonpoint source loading whereas Chl was most accurately predicted by the Vollenweider approach in <b>estuaries</b> dominated by point-source loading. In the PEI <b>estuaries,</b> the accuracy of the land-use model was comparable to the accuracy of the TP model. The PEI <b>estuaries</b> had much lower yields of Chl per unit nutrient than lakes suggesting differences among systems. This Chl deficit (expected-observed Chl) was accounted for by herbivory and turbidity, neither of which factors are exclusive to <b>estuaries.</b> The comparison of Chl response to nutrients and land-use across lakes and <b>estuaries</b> demonstrated no systematic differences as a function of tidal energy, openness or salinity. The regression models based on the combined data accurately predicted Chl as a function of TP and percentage of the catchment forested and mean depth. These results su...|$|R

40|$|The {{biogeography}} {{and community}} {{structure of the}} fishes of South African <b>estuaries</b> was investigated. In all, 109 systems were examined representing two broad types: temporarily closed and permanently open <b>estuaries.</b> Multivariate analyses of the fish communities identified three biogeographic regions. A cool-temperate region extended along the west and southwest coasts; a warmtemperate zone stretched along the south, southeast and east coasts and a subtropical region occurred along the east coast. The boundaries of these biogeographic regions were also delineated. The general physico-chemical characteristics of the <b>estuaries</b> within the three biogeographic regions also reflected regional differences in climate, rainfall and ocean conditions. Estuarine temperatures followed the trend for marine coastal waters, decreasing from subtropical <b>estuaries</b> toward cool-temperate systems. The low rainfall and runoff in the warm-temperate region together with high evaporation rates and strong seawater input resulted in higher salinities in these <b>estuaries.</b> These factors also accounted for the predominantly clearer waters in warm-temperate <b>estuaries.</b> The <b>estuaries</b> in the three biogeographic regions were also shown to contain somewhat distinctive fish assemblages. Temperature and salinity {{appeared to be the}} two main factors affecting the distribution and abundance of fishes in South African <b>estuaries.</b> Subtropical systems were characterised by fishes mostly of tropical origin as well as certain south coast endemic species. Warm-temperate <b>estuaries</b> were dominated by endemic taxa with some tropical species also present. The fish fauna of cooltemperate <b>estuaries</b> mostly comprised south coast endemic species with cosmopolitan and temperate taxa also present. Certain functional components of the ichthyofauna also exhibited slight differences between regions. Freshwater fishes were a major component of closed subtropical <b>estuaries</b> while estuarine resident species were more abundant in warm-temperate <b>estuaries.</b> Overall, estuarine-dependent marine species dominated the fish fauna of the <b>estuaries</b> in all biogeographic regions, signifying that South African <b>estuaries</b> perform a vital nursery function for this group of fishes. Slight differences were also apparent in the trophic structure of the fishes; these were related to environmental differences between regions. Zooplanktivores and fishes that feed on aquatic macrophytes/invertebrates assumed a relatively higher importance in warm-temperate systems. Overall, detritivores dominated the estuarine fish fauna in all regions, indicating that detritus forms the main energy source in South African <b>estuaries...</b>|$|R

40|$|The role of {{asymmetric}} tidal mixing (ATM) in subtidal estuarine dynamics is investigated using {{a series}} of generic numerical experiments that simulate narrow <b>estuaries</b> under different stratification and external forcing conditions. The focus is on quantifying the characteristics of ATM-induced flow and its contributions to stratification and salt transport. The flow induced by ATM has a two-layer vertical structure in periodically stratified <b>estuaries,</b> {{similar to that of}} the density-driven flow. It has a three-layer vertical structure in the central regime of weakly stratified <b>estuaries,</b> and a reverse two-layer structure in highly stratified <b>estuaries.</b> The changes in vertical distribution of ATM-induced flows result from the influence of stratification on the covariance of eddy viscosity and vertical shear. Such covariance represents the driving force of ATM-induced flow in the tidally averaged momentum equation. Compared to density-driven flow, ATM-induced flow dominates in periodically stratified <b>estuaries</b> with strong tides, has the same order of magnitude in weakly stratified <b>estuaries</b> with moderate tides, and is less important in highly stratified <b>estuaries</b> with weak tides. In contrast to density-driven flow that always increases estuarine stratification and transports salt landward, the ATM-induced flow exhibits different behaviors because of its varying vertical structure. In <b>estuaries</b> with strong tides, ATMinduced flow tends to enhance stratification and to transport salt landward, similar to density-driven flow.
