Here we describe a system that allows high channel count recordings from a small volume of neuronal tissue using a lightweight signal multiplexing head-stage that permits free behavior of small rodents. The system integrates multi-shank, high-density recording silicon probes, ultra-flexible interconnects and a miniaturized microdrive. These improvements allowed for simultaneous recordings of local field potentials and unit activity from hundreds of sites without confining free movements of the animal. The advantages of large-scale recordings are illustrated by determining the electro-anatomical boundaries of layers and regions in the hippocampus and neocortex and constructing a circuit <b>diagram</b> <b>of</b> functional <b>connections</b> among neurons in real anatomical space.

[...] There’s no terminal punctuation; the sentences just hang there in midair, a lot like a radio transmission that suddenly goes dead. There’s a growing sense of desperation in the messages as the book progresses, and it ends with a final one-line transmission that somehow both ties everything together and busts it apart.

3000|$|Graph theory affords {{some insight}} into when unique, two-step {{projections}} can be made. There are close parallels between graphs and multistate models, though {{they have not been}} well explored from a demographic perspective. We have already used the graph theory concepts of path and cycle. Another useful concept is that of “tree”, a connected graph with no cycles (Chartrand and Zhang 2012; Rebane and Pearl 1987). In demographic terms, a tree describes a strictly hierarchical multistate model. There is one tree in two- and three-state models, the path model. In four-state models there are two trees, the path and “Y” forms, the latter where <b>diagrams</b> <b>of</b> the <b>connections</b> between states resemble the letter Y. When N[*]=[*] 5, there are three trees, the path, the Y, and the “star”, the latter having four states that connect directly to the fifth state. The number of tree forms increases with N, as six-, seven-, and eight-state models have 6, 11, and 23 distinct forms, respectively (Chartrand and Zhang 2012; Rebane and Pearl 1987). Each tree has (N[*]−[*] 1) links. Now assume that each link represents two rates, one in each direction. Every such modified tree can be interpreted as an acyclic multistate model with 2 (N[*]−[*] 1) rates. All such tree-form models are fully soluble by the two-step IL-RR approach when the τ [...]...|$|R

40|$|The {{material}} turn {{in critical}} approaches to contemporary media, games and art presents an impetus to go even deeper {{to the underlying}} logical and technical architecture of the digital: code. Whilst code may be as routinely obscured, by commercial and scholarly focus on more visible interfaces, as it is pervasive, we caution against the tendency to position code as a magical solution. Code, we argue, only executes {{in a way that}} is always composite and transversal, reliant upon and drawing into relation a vast network of actors and materialities, across multiple levels and forms. The papers that comprise this special issue take up the analytical challenge this suggests, addressing code in relation to topics ranging from material computing, digital heritage, gestural gaming, platform labour and the digitality of text, to DDoS attacks, the spatiality of ARGs, video game engrossment and the intimacy of white lines. Against this backdrop, this introductory essay frames the complex materialities and in/visibilities of code. We argue that code, in its semiotic and technical senses alike, both enables and obscures - in fact, it conveys often through forms of masking and erasure. We thus position code as a negative-yet-generative force, through a study of the politics and aesthetics of redaction. Code emerges as an analytical figure able to <b>diagram</b> forms <b>of</b> <b>connection</b> and tessellation, but also negation and erasure, within material, technological and cultural assemblages...|$|R
