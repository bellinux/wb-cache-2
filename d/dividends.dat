Between 1836 and 1856, they ranged from five per cent to eight per cent. Rather than the proprietors collecting the tolls, they were let to toll collectors. In 1816, John Keyworth paid £1,010 for the privilege, while by 1839, Joshua Bower had to pay £1,590. This practice ceased in 1851, as receipts fell.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} 1936, Aberhart's {{government}} had made no progress towards the promised <b>dividends,</b> leaving many Albertans disillusioned and frustrated. These Albertans included some of Aberhart's own Social Credit MLAs, who had been elected {{on the promise of}} <b>dividends</b> and were angry at Aberhart's failure to follow through. Some of them felt that, while the idea of social credit was sound, Aberhart lacked a real understanding of Douglas's theory and could not implement it. These MLAs wanted Douglas or somebody from his British organization to come to Alberta and deliver on Aberhart's campaign promises. One such MLA, Samuel Barnes, had been expelled from the Social Credit caucus and from the Social Credit League for voicing these views.|$|E

5|$|Payment of <b>dividends</b> to {{shareholders}} began in 1792, {{and over the}} next five years, tolls raised an average of £893 per year and the dividend was 3.1 per cent. At this time, George Wyndham, 3rd Earl of Egremont was buying shares and having obtained one third of them, he became chairman of the company. He then stopped the payment of <b>dividends</b> so that the borrowed capital could be paid off more quickly. Apart from an interim payment in 1821, <b>dividends</b> were not reinstated until 1830. In the 1790s Wyndham was responsible for the canalisation of the River Rother which joins the Arun at Stopham, and he also promoted the Wey and Arun Canal, which was seen {{as part of a larger}} scheme to link London to Portsmouth, an idea which had been contemplated several times since 1641. He chaired a meeting held at Guildford on 1 June 1811, at which it was decided to press ahead with the canal, and put up £20,000 of the initial £90,500 estimated cost. The canal opened in September 1816, but the estimated 100,000 tons of traffic passing between London and the dockyards at Portsmouth, and the 30,000 tons of local traffic, were far too optimistic, with actual traffic averaging around 15,000 tons per year throughout its life.|$|E

The dissidents were unhappy with Aberhart's failure to provide Albertans with C$25 monthly <b>dividends</b> through social credit as he had promised before his 1935election.

The LGOC was the dominant bus operator in the capital and its high profitability (it paid <b>dividends</b> of 18 per cent compared with Underground Group companies' <b>dividends</b> of 1 to 3 per cent) subsidised the rest of the group. Through the UERL's shareholding in the London and Suburban Traction Company (LSTC), which it owned jointly with British Electric Traction, the UERL took control in 1913 of the London United Tramways, the Metropolitan Electric Tramways and the South Metropolitan Electric Tramways. The UERL also took control of bus builder AEC. The much enlarged group became known as the Combine. Only the MR (and its subsidiaries the Great Northern & City Railway and the East London Railway) and the W (by then fully owned by the London and South Western Railway) remained outside of the Underground Group's control.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes that}} {{corporate}} private information is {{transmitted to the}} market in two complementary phases. The accounting information is released first, followed by a <b>dividend</b> change announcement. Hence, investors assess the <b>dividend</b> signal only after consideration of accounting information. The analysis suggests that the <b>dividend</b> signal has three components: the expected favourableness of a <b>dividend</b> signal (good, bad, or ambiguous), the direction of <b>dividend</b> change (+ or -) {{and the role of}} the <b>dividend</b> signal (confirmatory, clarificatory or unclear) in clearing corporate uncertainty. The mechanism of classifying the signal according to the three components is presented and tested. Consistent with the <b>dividend</b> literature, <b>dividend</b> change announcements are found to influence share prices. Also, the role of <b>dividend</b> signals has a distinguishable effect on the firm's share price. Nevertheless, the expected favourableness of a <b>dividend</b> signal emerges as the dominant factor among the three signalling components. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Defined by Baker and Wurgler (2004 a), <b>dividend</b> premium is the {{difference}} between the average market-to-book ratio of <b>dividend</b> payers and non-payers. We study what <b>dividend</b> premium is by examining two explanations, agency explanation and signaling explanation. Using U. S. industrial firms from 1962 to 2004, we find evidence consistent with the agency theory that <b>dividend</b> premium is higher when the need to mitigate the agency problem is greater. In particular, <b>dividend</b> premium is positively related to {{the difference}} in cash holdings {{at the beginning of the}} year between <b>dividend</b> payers and nonpayers, and is negatively related to the difference in future profitability between <b>dividend</b> payers and nonpayers. In other words, investors value <b>dividend</b> payers with a higher premium when <b>dividend</b> payers have more cash and fewer profitable future investment projects than nonpayers. 1...|$|R
