40|$|Sunspot {{groups and}} bipolar {{magnetic}} regions (BMRs) {{serve as an}} observational diagnostic of the solar cycle. We use Debrecen Photohelographic Data (DPD) from 1974 - 2014 that determined sunspot tilt angles from daily white light observations, and data provided by Li & Ulrich that determined sunspot magnetic tilt angle using Mount Wilson magnetograms from 1974 - 2012. The magnetograms allowed for BMR tilt angles that were anti-Hale in configuration, so tilt values ranged from 0 to 360 rather than the more common ± 90. We explore the visual representation of magnetic tilt angles on a traditional butterfly diagram by plotting the mean area-weighted latitude of umbral activity in each bipolar sunspot group, including tilt information. The large scatter of tilt angles {{over the course of}} a single cycle and hemisphere prevents Joy's law from being visually identified in the tilt-butterfly diagram without further binning. The average latitude of anti-Hale regions does not differ from the average latitude of all regions in both hemispheres. The distribution of anti-Hale sunspot tilt angles are broadly distributed between 0 and 360 with a weak preference for east-west alignment 180 from their expected Joy's law angle. The anti-Hale sunspots display a log-normal size distribution similar to that of all sunspots, <b>indicating</b> no <b>preferred</b> <b>size</b> for anti-Hale sunspots. We report that 8. 4...|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of wirelessly networked applications, components {{interact with each}} other more frequently. An essential challenge for security is to determine how one network entity can trust another. Most existing trust models evaluate trust, Choosing a single probability-based parameter based on probabilistic estimation. However malicious nodes can take advantage of this to either gain unfair trust values for themselves, or to degrade the trust values of other nodes. A multi-parameter trust framework for MANETs (MTFM) presented in this thesis employs multiple types of parameters for the evaluation of trust based on Grey theory. The proposed framework classifies the trust relationships into three types: direct, recommendation and indirect. The mobility of the MANET nodes in a trust grouping may cause large variances in the trust values. Simulations conducted in 6 -node network demonstrate that MTFM can maintain consistent total trust values in the presence of various types of mobility. Misbehaviour detection strategies for the MTFM apply weight vector groups for multiple parameters, based on the design of an Analytic Hierarchy Process. This approach brings a significant benefit; the MTFM can not only detect misbehaviour, but can also detect the particular parameter use<:! in the strategy of the malicious node. A new combined prediction model provides a boundary to permit discrimination between normal and abnormal behaviour. And additional contribution is the issue of the trust group size. Although the resulting trust value can be resilient to unfair evaluation from malicious neighbour nodes, however, due to their limited recourses, having a lot of neighbours is not practical for wireless mobile nodes. Therefore. {{there needs to be a}} balance between maintaining trust values and the insensitivity of a subgroup to a changed trust value.

40|$|A {{characteristic}} {{feature in}} the primary visual cortex is that visual responses are suppressed as a stimulus extends beyond the classical receptive field. Here, we examined the role of inhibitory neurons expressing somatostatin (SOM(+)) or parvalbumin (PV(+)) on surround suppression and <b>preferred</b> receptive field <b>size.</b> We recorded multichannel extracellular activity in V 1 of transgenic mice expressing channelrhodopsin in SOM(+) neurons or PV(+) neurons. <b>Preferred</b> <b>size</b> and surround suppression were measured using drifting square-wave gratings of varying radii and at two contrasts. Consistent with findings in primates, {{we found that the}} <b>preferred</b> <b>size</b> was larger for lower contrasts across all cortical depths, whereas the suppression index (SI) showed a trend to decrease with contrast. We then examined the effect of these metrics on units that were suppressed by photoactivation of either SOM(+) or PV(+) neurons. When activating SOM(+) neurons, we found a significant increase in SI at cortical depths > 400 mum, whereas activating PV(+) neurons caused a trend toward lower SIs regardless of cortical depth. Conversely, activating PV(+) neurons significantly increased <b>preferred</b> <b>size</b> across all cortical depths, similar to lowering contrast, whereas activating SOM(+) neurons had no systematic effect on <b>preferred</b> <b>size</b> across all depths. These data suggest that SOM(+) and PV(+) neurons contribute differently to spatial integration. Our findings are compatible with the notion that SOM(+) neurons mediate surround suppression, particularly in deeper cortex, whereas PV(+) activation decreases the drive of the input to cortex and therefore resembles the effects on spatial integration of lowering contrast...|$|R

When the choice was between mosquitoes of different sizes (both blood- or both sugar-fed), small juveniles chose the smaller prey, whereas adults and larger juveniles chose the larger prey.
