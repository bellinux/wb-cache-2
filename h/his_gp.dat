5000|$|In Kyuss, in {{an attempt}} to attain an {{original}} sound, Homme developed the unconventional method of downtuning his guitar by ear to a pitch around C standard, [...] "tuning down until the strings started to flop, and then (tuning) up a bit." [...] This tuning later became a staple of Homme's sound carried into Queens of the Stone Age.During the tours up until Lullabies to Paralyze, Homme used <b>his</b> Ovation Ultra <b>GP's</b> for such, while switching to first an Airline guitar, then his Gibson Marauder, Maton Mastersounds, and then finally his Epiphone Dot for other tunings. Following the Songs for the Deaf tour Homme desired a fundamental change, and retired <b>his</b> <b>GPs</b> from both live use and recording, and switched to almost exclusively using semihollow guitars such as his Maton BB1200s and MotorAve BelAires.
