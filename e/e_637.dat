40|$|Long QT {{syndrome}} type 2 (LQT 2) is {{the second}} most common type of all long QT syndromes. It is well-known that trafficking deficient mutant human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) proteins are often involved in LQT 2. Cells respond to misfolded and trafficking-deficient proteins by eliciting the unfolded protein response (UPR) and Activating Transcription Factor (ATF 6) has been identified as a key regulator of the mammalian UPR. In this study, we investigated the role of ER chaperone proteins (Calnexin and Calreticulin) in the processing of G 572 R-hERG and <b>E</b> <b>637</b> K-hERG mutant proteins. pcDNA 3 -WT-hERG, pcDNA 3 -G 572 R-hERG and pcDNA 3 -E 637 K-hERG plasmids were transfected into U 2 OS and HEK 293 cells. Confocal microscopy and western blotting were used to analyze subcellular localization and protein expression. Interaction between WT or mutant hERGs and Calnexin/Calreticulin was tested by coimmunoprecipitation. To assess the role of the ubiquitin proteasome pathway in the degradation of mutant hERG proteins, transfected HEK 293 cells were treated with proteasome inhibitors and their effects on the steady state protein levels of WT and mutant hERGs were examined. Our results showed that levels of core-glycosylated immature forms of G 572 R-hERG and <b>E</b> <b>637</b> K-hERG in association with Calnexin and Calreticulin were higher than that in WT-hERG. Both mutant hERG proteins could activate the UPR by upregulating levels of active ATF 6. Furthermore, proteasome inhibition increased the levels of core-glycosylated immature forms of WT and mutant hERGs. In addition, interaction between mutant hERGs and Calnexin/Calreticulin was stronger after proteasome inhibition, compared to WT-hERG. These results suggest that trafficking-deficient G 572 R-hERG and <b>E</b> <b>637</b> K-hERG mutant proteins can activate ER stress pathways and are targeted to the proteasome for degradation.

40|$|The BrafV <b>637</b> <b>E</b> {{mutation}} {{is frequently}} reported in mouse hepatic tumors, {{depending on the}} mouse strain, and corresponds to the human BrafV 600 E mutation. In this study, we detected the BrafV <b>637</b> <b>E</b> mutation by whole-exome analysis in 4 / 4 hepatic tumors induced by neonatal treatment with diethylnitrosamine (DEN) in male B 6 C 3 F 1 mice. We also detected the BrafV <b>637</b> <b>E</b> mutation in 54 / 63 (85. 7 %) hepatic lesions, including microscopic foci and grossly visible tumors, by PCR-direct sequencing. Although the mutation was detected in 5 / 7 (71. 4 %) hepatic tumors induced by neonatal DEN treatment followed by repeated CCl 4 administration, it was not detected in 24 tumors induced by CCl 4 treatment without DEN or in eight spontaneous lesions in B 6 C 3 F 1 mice, suggesting that the mutation is induced by the genotoxic action of DEN. The DEN-induced tumors exhibited hyperphosphorylation of ERK 1 and Akt, suggesting that the BrafV <b>637</b> <b>E</b> mutation might activate the MAPK and Akt pathways. Moreover, the DEN-induced tumors overexpressed mRNAs for the oncogene-induced senescence (OIS) markers such as p 15 Ink 4 b and p 19 Arf as well as pro-survival/pro-proliferative cytokines/chemokines such as complement C 5 /C 5 a, ICAM- 1, IL- 1 receptor antagonist and CXCL 9, suggesting that the BrafV <b>637</b> <b>E</b> mutation influences the expression of genes involved in either OIS or cellular growth/survival.

40|$|Colon {{cancer cells}} {{frequently}} carry mutations that activate the β-catenin and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling cascades. Yet how oncogenic alterations interact to control cellular hierarchies during tumor initiation and progression is largely unknown. We found that oncogenic BRAF modulates gene expression associated with cell differentiation in colon cancer cells. We therefore engineered a mouse with an inducible oncogenic BRAF transgene, and analyzed BRAF effects on cellular hierarchies in the intestinal epithelium in vivo and in primary organotypic culture. We demonstrate that transgenic expression of oncogenic BRAF in the mouse strongly activated MAPK signal transduction, {{resulted in the}} rapid development of generalized serrated dysplasia, but unexpectedly also induced depletion of the intestinal stem cell (ISC) pool. Histological and gene expression analyses indicate that ISCs collectively converted to short-lived progenitor cells after BRAF activation. As Wnt/β-catenin signals encourage ISC identity, we asked whether β-catenin activity could counteract oncogenic BRAF. Indeed, we found that intestinal organoids could be partially protected from deleterious oncogenic BRAF effects by Wnt 3 a or by small-molecule inhibition of GSK 3 β. Similarly, transgenic expression of stabilized β-catenin in addition to oncogenic BRAF partially prevented loss of stem cells in the mouse intestine. We also used BRAFV <b>637</b> <b>E</b> knock-in mice to follow changes in the stem cell pool during serrated tumor progression and found ISC marker expression reduced in serrated hyperplasia forming after BRAF activation, but intensified in progressive dysplastic foci characterized by additional mutations that activate the Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Our study suggests that oncogenic alterations activating the MAPK and Wnt/β-catenin pathways must be consecutively and coordinately selected to assure stem cell maintenance during colon cancer initiation and progression. Notably, loss of stem cell identity upon induction of BRAF/MAPK activity may represent a novel fail-safe mechanism protecting intestinal tissue from oncogene activation...|$|R
40|$|The {{relative}} importance of the three particulate matter (PM) size fractions in ambient air, i. e. coarse (2. 5 - 10 μm), fine (0. 1 - 2. 5 μm) and ultrafine (< 0. 1 μm) fractions, on the induction of adverse health effects is still unknown. Moreover, there is no straightforward relationship between ambient concentration levels, exposure (external dose) and the dose delivered to the target site (internal dose). Recently, a human and a rat airway PM deposition model (MPPDep V 1. 1) have been developed by CIIT Centers for Health Research and the National Institute of Public Health and the Environment (RIVM), {{based on the work}} of O. G. Raabe et al. (1977, In: W. H. Walton, editor, Inhaled Particles IV/ 2; Pergamon, Oxford) and S. Anjilvel and B. Asgharian (1995, Fundam Appl Toxicol 28 : 41 - 50). This paper describes studies using cadmium chloride (CdCl 2) as a model for toxic aerosol particles to (1) investigate the role of particle size in the development of pulmonary effects, and (2) evaluate the MPPDep model, by comparing predicted deposition with measured deposition of CdCl 2 in the respiratory tract. Rats (ten per group) were exposed for a single 4 -h period to CdCl 2 particles at various sizes, i. <b>e.</b> 33, 170, <b>637</b> and 1495 nm, all at a target concentration of 1 mg/m 3. Immediately after exposure, four of ten rats per group were killed and trachea, lung lobes, heart, liver and kidneys were collected and preserved to determine the amount of CdCl 2 present in each of these organs. CdCl 2 -induced toxicity, as measured by lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), N-acetyl glucosaminidase (NAG) and protein levels in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid, was determined in the remaining six rats per group the day after exposure. Animals exposed to 33 nm particles showed the highest level of respiratory toxicity, followed by animals exposed to 637 nm particles, then to 170 nm particles and finally by those exposed to 1495 nm particles. Pulmonary cadmium levels showed a similar relationship. The results from the present study suggest that the induction of pulmonary toxicity following inhalation exposure to soluble CdCl 2 particles in the range 30 - 1500 nm depends on the amount of deposited material, which in its turn depends on the initial (aerodynamic) particle size. In addition, the MPPDep model accurately predicted the measured CdCl 2 deposition. Conclusively, for soluble particles the deposited pulmonary mass (dose) of particles is important for toxicity and is dependent of particle size. These findings may have serious impact on the evaluation of the role of various particle sizes in PM 10 -associated health effects. Chemicals/CAS: Aerosols; Cadmium Chloride, 10108 - 64 -...|$|R
40|$|Dissertação (mestrado) —Universidade de Brasília, Faculdade de Ciências da Saúde, 2007. A Insuficiência Renal Crônica (IRC) é uma doença que afeta todo o sistema orgânico do indivíduo. Ela evolui com complicações sistêmicas como miopatia urêmica, anemia, hiperparatireoidismo secundário, entre outras que levam o paciente a desenvolver déficits funcionais. O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a função pulmonar, a capacidade de exercício e a qualidade de vida em pacientes com IRC. Foram avaliados 72 indivíduos, sendo 32 pacientes com IRC que estão sob tratamento de hemodiálise (GD) há mais de 6 meses, 10 pacientes transplantados renais (GT) e 30 sujeitos saudáveis para compor o grupo controle (GC). A distribuição da idade foi de 43, 9 (2, 3) anos, o peso 65, 9 (2, 2) Kg e a altura 1, 67 (0, 01) metros para o GD; 50, 4 (2, 7) anos, 75, 2 (5, 1) Kg e 1, 7 (0, 02) metros para o GT; 48, 4 (2, 6) anos, 71, 7 (2, 2) Kg e 1, 67 (0, 01) metros para o GC. A avaliação da função pulmonar constou de espirometria segundo as normas da American Thoracic Society (1995), avaliação da força muscular respiratória segundo a técnica de pressões inspiratória (PImax) e expiratória (PEmax) máximas, descrita por Black & Hyatt (1969) e mobilidade torácica segundo adaptação do método utilizado por Kakizaki (1999). A capacidade de exercício foi avaliada pelo teste da distância percorrida em seis minutos (DP 6 min) segundo American Thoracic Society (2002). A qualidade de vida (QV) foi avaliada mediante questionário genérico SF- 36 no GD e GT. Foram analisados resultados de exames laboratoriais: uréia, creatinina, PTH, hemoglobina, cálcio e fósforo para o GD. Todos os valores estão descritos na forma de média (erro padrão). A análise estatística utilizou os testes ANOVA e teste t de Student para os dados de distribuição normal; Mann-Whitney e Kruskall-Wallis para os dados de distribuição não-normal. Teste qui-quadrado para associação de grupos e variáveis e correlação de Pearson entre os parâmetros funcionais, considerando, para todos P< 0, 05 como índice mínimo de significância estatística. Foram encontrados resultados estatisticamente significativos (p< 0, 01) entre os grupos para os seguintes parâmetros: diminuição da função pulmonar (CVF, VEF 1, VVM, CV, PImax, PEmax) nos pacientes do GD e GT; associação entre diminuição da PImax e GD (? = 0, 5, p< 0, 001); diminuição da capacidade de exercício (DP 6 min) no GD e GT (p< 0, 01). Não foram encontrados diferenças nos parâmetros funcionais segundo a classificação dos exames laboratoriais no GD. Não houve diferença para a QV entre GD e GT porém a pontuação está abaixo do valor esperado para normalidade. Foram encontradas correlações significativas (p< 0, 05) no GD entre CVF e DP 6 min (r= 0, 355), CVF e Total do SF- 36 (r= 0, 414), CVF e VVM (r= 0, 469), DP 6 min e Total do SF- 36 (r= 0, 439), DP 6 min e Funcionalidade (r= 0, 708), VVM e Total do SF- 36 (r= 0, 348), PImax e PEmax (r= 0, 548).

This complication {{has been associated}} with symptoms like weakness and functional impairment. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate pulmonary function, exercise capacity and quality of life in the patients with CKD. There were evaluated 72 subjects: 32 patients with CKD (DG), 10 patients post renal transplantation (TG) and 30 normal subjects that was called control group (CG). The DG group has been on hemodialysis treatment during at least 6 months, 43, 9 (2, 3) years, 65, 9 (2, 2) Kg and 1, 67 (0, 01) meters. The TG group has done the renal transplantation at least 6 months and have to be clinically stable, 50, 4 (2, 7) years, 75, 2 (5, 1) Kg and 1, 7 (0, 02) meters. The CG group, 48, 4 (2, 6) years, 71, 7 (2, 2) Kg and 1, 67 (0, 01) meters, must not be respiratory, cardiac or others that can impaired the evaluated variables. The pulmonary function was evaluated by spirometry according to American Thoracic Society (1995), by maximal inspiratory pressure (MIP) and expiratory pressure (MEP) according to Black and Hyatt protocol (1969) and by chest wall motion using an adaptation from Kakisaki (1999) methods. The exercise capacity was measured using the six minute walking test (6 MWT) according to American Thoraci Society (2002). The quality of life was measured using SF- 36 questionnaire to DG and TG groups. There were analyzed the exams from DG group. Al values was showed with mean (standard error). The statistical analysis were done using one way ANOVA and Student t test for normal distribution sample. Mann-Whitney e Kruskall-Wallis tests for unormal distribution sample. Qui-square test for association between variables and groups and Pearson’s correlation between functional variables. All test has considered p< 0, 05 to minimum statistical significant level. The results showed statistical different values to: reduction of pulmonary function (FVC, FEV 1, MVV, VC, MIP, MEP) in DG and TG groups; association between MIP reduction and DG group; exercise capacity reduction (6 MWT) in DG and TG groups. There were not found differences in functional parameters when classifying DG group by exams results. There were not differences between DG and TG group in SF- 36 analysis; however the mean values were under the normal values expected for normal population. We found significative correlations (p< 0, 05) in DG group between FVC and 6 MWT (r= 0, 355), FVC and e Total from SF- 36 (r= 0, 414), FVC and MVV (r= 0, 469), 6 MWT and Total from SF- 36 (r= 0, 439), 6 MWT and Physical Functioning (r= 0, 708), MVV and Total from SF- 36 (r= 0, 348), MIP and MEP (r= 0, 548). We also found significative correlations (p< 0, 05) between MIP and MEP to TG (r= 0, 637) and CG (r= 0, 846) groups. We conclude that there were differences in pulmonary function, exercise capacity and quality of life in patient with CKD that indicate some degree of functional impairment in this population. This functional impairment appears in haemodialysis patients and in post renal transplant patients...|$|R
