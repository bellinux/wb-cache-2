5|$|The {{film was}} a success, {{securing}} three Oscar nominations, including Best Picture, Best Sound Recording and Best Supporting Actor for Lemmon, who won. While Cagney was not nominated, he had thoroughly enjoyed the production. Filming on Midway Island {{and in a}} more minor role meant that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> relax and engage in his hobby of painting. He also drew caricatures of the cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs {{joined the}} Corps in October 1916 as an air {{mechanic}} and after training was posted to London, then Norfolk; at first <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> appear in charity cricket matches {{and in several}} games for Idle. In November 1917, he joined 110 Squadron which remained in England despite plans {{to send it to}} France. By 1918, the cricket authorities began to arrange more matches and Hobbs played successfully several times at Lord's. In September 1918, 110 Squadron, as part of the newly formed Royal Air Force (RAF), was sent to France and took an active part in the fighting, but Hobbs never discussed his career in the RAF. Even so, some of his family remained critical and felt that the worst of the war was over when Hobbs went to France. He was demobilised in February 1919.|$|E

25|$|Writing to Darwin in 1871, Matthew {{enclosed}} {{an article}} {{he had written}} for The Scotsman and, as well as wishing that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> write a critique of The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, expressed the belief that {{there is evidence of}} design and benevolence in nature, and that beauty cannot be accounted for by natural selection. Such a belief is mainstream natural theology, and reveals how far Matthew was from Darwin in realising the potential of evolutionary explanations: for him as well as others, man was the sticking-point.|$|E
25|$|Alfredsson {{was arguably}} Ottawa's {{best player in}} the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals, which the Senators {{ultimately}} lost to the Anaheim Ducks in a five-game series. In a controversial incident in game four, an Alfredsson slap shot hit Ducks captain Scott Niedermayer {{at the end of the}} second period, leading to speculation that Alfredsson intended to injure Niedermayer. Alfredsson dismissed the notion, saying that he had glanced up at the clock to see if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> move in for a better shot, and then quickly fired in the heat of an important game.|$|E
25|$|Even though López did not {{participate}} in the 1941 event, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> join the Venezuelan league after returning from Cuba. He was unquestionably the dominant pitcher in the circuit, fashioning a ledger of 9-4 with 55 strikeouts and a 0.67 ERA to win the pitching Triple Crown, while handling a 121-inning work in his first full season for Magallanes, allowing also only nine earned runs on 67 hits and 22 walks. As an ace pitcher and cleanup hitter, he also hurled two no-hitters, led in innings pitched, and smashed the only home run of the tournament. Although this was a wasted effort, because of the fact of his team lost the final and decisive game to the eventual champions Patriotas de Venezuela.|$|E

25|$|On April 23, 1864, when Steele {{received}} the dispatch from Banks asking that he join Banks {{so they could}} move again on Shreveport, Steele responded {{that he was in}} no position to join Banks. He also noted that he now faced not only Confederate cavalry but Sterling Price's returned infantry and additional infantry under Kirby Smith. Kirby Smith had joined Price with some of the infantry which had been with Taylor at the battle of Pleasant Hill. Brigadier-General Thomas Churchill’s Arkansas division and Brigadier-General Mosby Parsons's Missouri division had returned to Price's command. They were followed by Major-General John Walker’s larger Texas division with Kirby Smith. Kirby Smith had decided that Steele was a bigger threat, and a bigger prize, than Banks when Banks continued to retreat after the battle of Pleasant Hill on April 9, 1864. Kirby Smith thought he could destroy Steele's force and perhaps still turn back and trap Banks later. Taylor vehemently disagreed with this decision and wanted to attack Banks immediately. Nonetheless, Taylor could not convince Kirby Smith to change his plan. As Banks appeared to be waiting for the naval force at Alexandria, Louisiana, Kirby Smith became even more certain that his decision was correct and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> execute it.|$|E
500|$|Despite his {{historic}} championship title, Gore was not {{enthusiastic about}} the new sport of lawn tennis. In 1890, thirteen years after winning his championship title, he wrote: [...] "...it is want of variety that will prevent lawn tennis {{in its present form}} from taking rank among our great games... That anyone who has really played well at cricket, tennis, or even rackets, will ever seriously give his attention to lawn tennis, beyond showing himself to be a promising player, is extremely doubtful; for in all probability the monotony of the game as compared with others would choke him off before <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> excel in it." [...] He did return for the 1878 Championship to defend his title in the Challenge Round but lost in straight sets to Frank Hadow, a coffee planter from Ceylon, who effectively used the lob to counter Gore's net play. It was Gore's last appearance at the Wimbledon Championships.|$|E

McGregor told Inside Soap that Mark {{did not stop}} loving Kate and that since <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> think about it, the issue was not as [...] "black and white" [...] as he first thought. Mark also noticed that Kyle Canning (Chris Milligan) had taken an interest in Kate {{and he did not}} like the idea of Kate moving on with Kyle. McGregor explained that Mark thought Kyle was an idiot and when he saw him with Kate, it forced Mark {{to come up with a}} plan to get closer to his ex-girlfriend. McGregor said, [...] "He comes up with a reason to summon her to the station - which Kate sees right through!" [...] Mark later asked Lucas for his advice, but Lucas was not much help. Both Kate and Mark wanted to get back together and Brewer said, [...] "They both have a lot of history, such as the lie that Kate told to protect Rebecca and then Mark does something which really hurts Kate, and this prevents them from moving forward." [...] The actress believed Mark was [...] "the one" [...] for Kate as they were both academic and focused.|$|E
60|$|This was {{addressed}} {{to the young man}} before mentioned, consisting chiefly of a human skeleton and a smock-frock, who was very awkward in his movements, apparently on account of having grown so very fast that before <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> get used to his height he was higher.|$|R

500|$|The {{management}} professor Peter Drucker credits Kafka {{with developing}} the first civilian hard hat while employed at the Worker's Accident Insurance Institute, {{but this is}} not supported by any document from his employer. His father often referred to his son's job as an insurance officer as a , literally [...] "bread job", a job done only to pay the bills; Kafka often claimed to despise it. Kafka was rapidly promoted and his duties included processing and investigating compensation claims, writing reports, and handling appeals from businessmen who thought their firms had been placed in too high a risk category, which cost them more in insurance premiums. He would compile and compose the annual report on the insurance institute for the several years he worked there. The reports were received well by his superiors. Kafka usually got off work at 2 p.m., so that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> spend on his literary work, to which he was committed. Kafka's father also expected him to help out at and take over the family fancy goods store. In his later years, Kafka's illness often prevented him from working at the insurance bureau and at his writing. Years later, Brod coined the term [...] ("The Close Prague Circle") to describe the group of writers, which included Kafka, Felix Weltsch and him.|$|E
500|$|Like God of War, {{the game}} uses Santa Monica's Kinetica engine. Senior combat {{designer}} Derek Daniels {{said that for}} God of War II, they were basing the magical attacks on elements (e.g., air and earth). He said the combat system was updated so that it flowed smoothly between attacks and switching between weapons and magic. He {{said that they were}} working for a similar balance of puzzle solving, exploration, and combat seen in the first game, and they used elements that worked in that game as a base for the overall balance. Unlike God of War where magic had a small role, Daniels said that for God of War II, their goal was to make magic {{an integral part of the}} combat system and to make it more refined. Barlog said the game would feature new creatures and heroes from the mythology, and he wanted to put more boss battles in it. Commenting on multiplayer options, Barlog said that [...] "there are possibilities for that but it is not something we are doing right now." [...] He said that he felt that God of War is a single-player experience, and although multiplayer [...] "would be cool," [...] it did not appeal to him to work on. As for a PlayStation Portable (PSP) installment, he said that he thought it [...] "would be freaking awesome," [...] but not something <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> work on and it was Sony's decision whether or not to make a PSP installment.|$|E

2500|$|Of {{greater concern}} to Donizetti was the singers {{who were to}} be engaged. Primarily, he was {{concerned}} about the identity of the leading tenor: [...] "Until I know for sure, I cannot compose duets, finales and trios", he writes in October. By the time Donizetti arrived in Venice on 6 January 1836, the score of Belisario was almost finished, and because of delays, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> hear several of the proposed singers in a performance of Rossini's L'assedio di Corinto given on 12 January, the day before rehearsals of Belisario were to begin.|$|E
2500|$|Edwards' father Thomas {{was from}} Middlesbrough {{and he was}} brought up in the town.

His obituary in The Times said that [...] "by ability and sheer hard work he rose to become a director of an old-established local ironworks", this being Messrs. Harrison Bros. (England) Ltd. As a director, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> pursue other business interests in the town, and also farmed in Guisborough. He was also a frequent visitor to the United States on lecture tours.|$|E
2500|$|Pressure {{from the}} Carter {{administration}} forced Banzer {{to institute a}} carefully regulated [...] "democratic opening" [...] in 1978. A restricted amnesty was declared, and the country prepared for democratic elections. Since the Bolivian constitution did not at the time allow a sitting president to immediately succeed himself, Banzer initially endorsed General Juan Pereda as the regime's candidate. It was assumed that Pereda would be elected with government [...] "help" [...] at the polls, rule for four years, and then allow Banzer to return as constitutional president once <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> polish up his image and transition to civilian politics. However, by election time the popularity of a left-wing coalition of former president Hernán Siles was such that nothing could disguise it.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1838, Donizetti {{moved to}} Paris vowing {{never to have}} {{dealings}} with the San Carlo again after the King of Naples banned the production of Poliuto {{on the grounds that}} such a sacred subject was inappropriate for the stage. In Paris, he offered Poliuto to the Opéra and it was set to a new and expanded four-act French-language libretto by Eugène Scribe with the title, Les Martyrs. Performed in April 1840, it was his first grand opera in the French tradition and was quite successful. Before leaving that city in June 1840, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> oversee the translation of Lucia di Lammermoor into Lucie de Lammermoor as well as to [...] write La fille du régiment, his first opera written specifically to a French libretto. This became another success.|$|E
2500|$|Ponting {{continued}} in the role for the series against the West Indies in 1996–97 in Australia. After two Test matches and three scores under 10, he was replaced by Justin Langer, despite scoring 88 in the First Test. He {{was out of the}} team for six months, and missed the remaining three Tests against the West Indies, the three Tests on the tour to South Africa, both series victories to Australia. Many [...] "experts" [...] thought the decision was unjustifiable. Former Australian coach, Bob Simpson, said: [...] "I really feel that Ricky could have been persevered with. He's a fine young cricketer and he'll now have to prove that he's got the tenacity and temperament to go with it." [...] Ponting's axing meant <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> regain his form in the Sheffield Shield.

[...] He was six feet tall and weighed [...] "190 pounds when in training and 212 pounds out of training. [...] One newspaper account described his athletic prowess as follows:"The famous athlete has won a 'Y' in three branches of sport and might win two or three more if <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> devote to that many games. [...] As left fielder on the baseball team, as hammer thrower on the track team and a football player Shevlin has been found worthy of the coveted letter. [...] He also is a good sprinter, basketball player, tennis expert and boxer. ... He can run 100 yards in less than 11 seconds and could easily make the varsity tennis and basket ball teams if he wished. [...] He is not on the golf team simply because he has not the time to devote to the game." ...|$|E
