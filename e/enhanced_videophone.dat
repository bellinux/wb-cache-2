40|$|Abstract - Arbitrarily programmable, but fixed-rate {{quadtree}} (QT) decomposed. parametrically <b>enhanced</b> <b>videophone</b> codecs using quarter common intermediate format (QCIF) video sequences {{are proposed}} {{as a direct}} replacement for mobile radio voice codecs In second generation systems, such as the Pan-European GSM, the American IS- 54 and IS- 95, {{as well as the}} Japanese systems. The corresponding bit rates are 13, 8, 9. 6 and 6. 7 kb/s, respectively. As an example, the proposed 11. 36 kb/s prototype Codec 1 and the 11 kb/s Codee 2 are embedded in the adaptively reconfigurable wireless videophone Systems 1 - 4 featured in Table IV and their video quality, bit rate, robustness, and complexity Issues are investigated. Coherent reconfigurable 16 or four-level pilot symbol assisted quadrature amplitude modulation (PSAQAM) is used and the system's robustness is Improved by a combination of diversity and automatic repeat request (ARQ) techniques. When using a bandwidth of 200 kHz, as In the Pan-European GSM mobile radio system, the number of videophone users supported varies between three and 16, while the minimum required channel signal to noise ratio over Gausslan and Rayleigh channels is in excess of 6 and 8 dB, respectively, assuming a noise-limited, rather than interference-limited scenario. The salient system features are summarized in Table 1 V...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the use of a videophone by people with an intellectual handicap and their relatives at a healthcare organisation in the Netherlands. A triangulation of methods is used. The first method was a questionnaire (pre-study) were 195 clients and 439 client representatives participated in a satisfaction survey from the healthcare organisation. Out of this satisfaction survey, approximately 30 % (N = 116 out of N = 374 reactions) identified concerns related to communication. Secondly, a literature study was carried out using Pubmed database. Eleven publications were selected. Finally, based on the pre-study and the literature an experiment was performed in which the videophone was evaluated. Two clients and two relatives used the videophone for approximately two months. The data supported the use of the videophone with intellectual handicapped and their relatives to improve communication. The addition of visual non-verbal cues and the fixed place of the <b>videophone</b> <b>enhanced</b> social presence, the concentration, the duration and the quality of the conversation. In general, the videophone was easy to use, but the sound and screen quality of the videophone could be improved to support communication...|$|R
