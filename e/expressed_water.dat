40|$|This study {{considered}} {{the possibility of using}} water expressed during the drying of fuel-grade peat as a substrate for microbial growth. Highly humified peat pressed for 2. 5 min at 1. 96 MPa produced water with a chemical oxygen demand of 690 mg/liter. Several biological compounds could be produced by using the organic matter in expressed peat water as a substrate. These included polymers such as chitosan, contained in the cell wall of Rhizopus arrhizus, and two extracellular polysaccharides, xanthan gum and pullulan, produced by Xanthomonas campestris and Aureobasidium pullulans, respectively. A very effective surfactant was produced by Bacillus subtilis grown in the <b>expressed</b> <b>water.</b> Small additions of nutrients to the peat pressate were necessary to obtain substantial yields of products. The addition of peptone, yeast extract, and glucose improved production of the various compounds. Biological treatment improved the quality of the <b>expressed</b> <b>water</b> to the extent that in an industrial process it could be returned to the environment...|$|E
40|$|Islands are {{specific}} environments whose natural features {{form the basis}} of social and economic development. It is particularly distinct on small islands. In hydrological terms, these are islands with surface areas between 100 and 1000 km 2. There are 40 small islands in the Mediterranean Basin. Most of these have very limited water resources, due to their geological structure and precipitation regime. This paper outlines the basic geographical and climatic features of small Mediterranean islands. It also suggests a ranking of islands with respect to an annual precipitation, precipitation surplus and hydrological size. In addition to an island's precipitation regime and geology, size and shape also influence its water potential.

5000|$|To take {{again the}} example of English, {{we find that the}} idea of <b>WATER</b> is <b>expressed</b> in a great variety of forms: one term serves to <b>express</b> <b>water</b> as a LIQUID; another one, water {{in the form of a}} large expanse (LAKE); others, water as running in a large body or in a small body (RIVER and BROOK); still other terms <b>express</b> <b>water</b> in the form of RAIN, DEW, WAVE, and FOAM.

40|$|ABSTRACT TO {{test the}} {{hypothesis}} that renal tissue contains multiple distinct water channels, mRNA prepared from either cortex, medulla, or papilla of rat kidney was injected into Xenopus oocytes. The osmotic water permeability (Pf) of oocytes injected with either 50 nl of water or 50 nl of renal mRNA (1 ~,g/~l) was measured 4 d after the injection. Pf was calculated from the rate of volume increase on exposure to hyposmotic medium. Injection of each renal mRNA preparation increased the oocyte Pf. This <b>expressed</b> <b>water</b> permeability was inhibited by p-chloromercuriphenylsulfonate and had a low energy of activation, consistent with the expression of water channels. The coinjection of an antisense oligonucleotide for CHIP 28 protein, at an assumed> 100 -fold molar excess, with either cortex, medulla, or papilla mRNA reduced {{the expression of the}} water permeability by ~ 70, 100, and 30 %, respectively. Exposure of the oocyte to cAMP for 1 h resulted in a further increase in Pf only in oocytes injected with medulla mRNA. This cAMP activation was not altered by the CHIP 28 antisense oligonucleotide. These results suggest that multiple distinct water channels were expressed in oocytes injected with mRNA obtained from sections of rat kidney: (a) CHIP 28 water channels in cortex and medulla, (b) cAMP-activated water channels in medulla, and (c) cAMP-insensitive water channels in papilla...|$|E

30|$|The {{mechanism}} whereby AVP regulates {{water balance}} is {{by increasing the}} renal collecting ducts’ permeability to water. Indeed, once it has been released in the systemic circulation, AVP binds to the V 2 receptor, a 7 -transmembrane domain protein coupled to G-proteins which {{is located on the}} basolateral surface of the collecting ducts. The ensuing intratubular cascade of events involves AMPc/PKA dependent pathways and culminates in the expression of aquaporin- 2 (AQP 2) water channels in the luminal surface of the collecting ducts, whereas they lay dormant niched in intratubular vesicles in the absence of AVP stimulation. AQP 2 thus serves as the regulated water entry route inside the tubule, as opposed to the exit route which depends upon constitutively <b>expressed</b> <b>water</b> channels (AQP 3 and AQP 4) found in the basolateral membrane of the tubules. However, the passive flux of water from the lumen of the tubule back to the systemic circulation is conditioned by the existence of an osmotic gradient between the tubular lumen (low) and the kidney’s interstitium (high), itself rendered possible by the corticopapillary gradient. [23]. AVP plays a vital part in sustaining this osmotic drive by enhancing the number of sodium channels (ENac), thus promoting sodium reabsorption in the cortical and outer medulla [24, 25]. For a comprehensive review and schematic representations of the interactions between AVP and the collecting duct, please refer to [26], figures  4 and 5.|$|E
40|$|AbstractExpression of aquaporins (AQP) {{and water}} {{permeability}} were studied in Xenopus laevis oocytes and immobilized glial cells by a pulsed-field gradient spin echo NMR technique and a photometric swelling assay. Oocytes injected with poly(A) RNA from C 6 -BU- 1 cells showed increased swelling behavior under hypoosmotic stress due to <b>expressed</b> <b>water</b> channels {{as compared to}} control oocytes. The swelling could be reversibly inhibited by HgCl 2. Furthermore, the intracellular relaxation time and the apparent intracellular diffusion coefficient of water in oocytes were determined by diffusion-weighted 1 H NMR experiments to be T 2 = 36 ms and Dapp,intra= 0. 18 × 10 − 3 mm 2 /s. In immobilized C 6 and F 98 cells the mean exchange time of intracellular water {{was found to be}} 51 ms which increased to 75 ms upon chronic treatment (4 days) in hypertonic medium. Additional hybrid depletion experiments with antisense oligonucleotides directed against AQP 1 were performed on oocytes and C 6 cells. Moreover, different water channel subtypes of glial cells were assessed by a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction assay. With this, the mRNA encoding AQP 1 could be detected in primary cultures and glial cell lines, whereas AQP 4 mRNA was found in astroglia-rich primary cultures, but not in F 98 and C 6 cells. Our results show that water permeability in glial cells is mainly mediated by water channels which {{play an important role in}} the regulation of water flow in brain under normal and pathological conditions...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Aquifer {{management}} {{is a complex}} problem in which various aspects {{should be taken into}} account. Specifically, there are conflicting objectives that should be achieved. On one side, there is the necessity to satisfy the water demand, on the other the resource water should be protected by infiltration of pollutants or substances that could reduce its availability in terms of short term and long term management. The aim {{of this paper is to}} develop a management model that is able to define the optimal pumping pattern for p (p= 1,…,P) wells that withdraw water from an aquifer (characterized by pollutant contamination) and hydraulically interact, with the objectives of satisfying an <b>expressed</b> <b>water</b> demand and control pollution. In order to formalize and solve the management problem, it is necessary to consider the equations governing flow and mass transport of the biodegradable pollutants characterizing the aquifer. Such equations may be solved by using a finite-difference numerical scheme. In this work, the numerical scheme is embedded in the management model. The decision (control) variables that are considered in the optimisation problems are the water flows pumped at each well p, at time interval t. Such flows influence the state variables of the system, that is, the hydraulic head and the pollutant concentrations in the aquifer. The objective function to be minimized in the optimisation problem includes three terms: water demand dissatisfaction, pollutant concentrations in the extracted water, and pollutant concentrations in all cells of the discretized aquifer. Finally, the optimisation problem has been solved for a specific case study (Savona District, Italy), relevant to a confined aquifer affected by nitrate pollution deriving from agriculture activities...|$|E

30|$|The {{membrane}} filtration technique was utilised for the cultivation and enumeration of faecal coliforms and Enterococcus spp. for both river water and riverbed sediments, following procedures described by Luna et al. (2010). The Chromocult® Coliform agar (Merck) and Chromocult® Enterococci agar (Merck) were used, respectively. In this study, the water displacement method previously described by Abia et al. (2015 a) {{was used to}} quantify the target bacteria in the sediments, instead of the common approach (weighting method). Briefly; this approach {{which is based on}} Archimedes’ principle consist of gradually transferring sediment samples were into a graduated 1  L Durham bottle containing 900  mL of 1 × PBS until the 1000  mL mark was reached to obtained a 10 % dilution (v/v). Thereafter the suspension was vigorously hand shaken for 2  min as described by Abia et al. (2015 a). The water displacement method, which is important to detach connected microorganisms from the sediment matrix and for the subsequent filtration step onto membranes, does not influence the growth of target bacteria (Abia et al. 2015 a). This method was developed in order to better compare microbial counts of sediment and water with one unit (CFU/ 100  mL) since other studies (Alm et al. 2003; Fries et al. 2008) <b>expressed</b> <b>water</b> and sediment in different units such as MPN GDW or CFU GDW versus CFU/ 100  mL.

For faecal coliforms, plates were incubated for 24  h at 44.5  °C and for Enterococcus spp., plates were incubated for 24 – 48  h at 37  °C. According to Abia et al. (2015 a), results obtained from riverbed sediments by water displacement methods for faecal coliform and Enterococcus spp. counts were reported as colony-forming units (CFUs) per 100  mL of sediment suspension in PBS and for river water as CFU/ 100  mL (Abia et al. 2015 a).|$|E
40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) {{is widely}} {{recognised}} {{as a growing}} global health issue with far ranging social and economic implications. The accumulation of Amyloid-β (Aβ) in the brain is a pathological hallmark of AD. A recently discovered lymphatic–like system in {{the central nervous system}} (termed the glymphatic system) has been postulated to be both implicit in the clearance of Aβ from the brain, and most effective during sleep—making sleep an important consideration in the investigation of AD. Central nervous system <b>expressed</b> <b>water</b> channel proteins, namely Aquaporin 1 and 4, have been suggested to play a pivotal role in glymphatic function and thus, clearance of Aβ from the brain. However, to-date this has only been investigated in AD rodent models and one human study of aquaporin/Aβ protein co-localisation in post mortem brain tissue. To partially address this gap in knowledge, the current study sought to investigate whether genetic variations (single nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) within the genes encoding aquaporin 1 (AQP 1) and aquaporin 4 (AQP 4), were associated with AD risk, brain Aβ burden and self-reported sleep parameters. Further, this study aimed to determine whether genetic variation moderated the relationship between sleep parameters and brain Aβ burden. This study was observational and cross-sectional in design, and utilised Genome-Wide Association Study, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), and Aβ positron emission tomography data from the larger Australian Imaging, Biomarkers and Lifestyle (AIBL) study. Genetic variation in AQP 1 and AQP 4 SNPs was not associated with either an increased AD risk or differences in brain Aβ burden. However, genetic variation in AQP 4, specifically rs 12968026, was associated with altered, self-reported, “overall” sleep quality (PSQI total score). Further, this study reports that several SNPs in AQP 1 and AQP 4 moderate the conditional effect that three PSQI-determined sleep parameters, namely, sleep latency (time taken to fall asleep, in minutes), sleep duration (length of sleep, in hours) and daytime dysfunction (disruption of daytime activities due to sleepiness), had on brain Aβ burden. Taken together, {{the results of this study}} add weight to the argument that the glymphatic system, is a major biological mechanism underpinning Aβ clearance from the brain. The findings also engender a greater understanding of what factors may moderate a sleep-AD phenotype relationship, and suggest that interventions targeted at improving suboptimal sleep parameters may be most effective at delaying AD onset when tailored to the genetics of the individual...|$|E

Two konjac types (Konjac/Starch, KS, Nutricol[] GP 440; Konjac/Carrageenan, KC, Nutricol[] GP 624) were incorporated into low-fat (3 %) bologna formulations at two levels (10 and 20 %). Each treatment combination was manufactured using a 65 and 70 % meat block (65 MB and 70 MB, respectively), and compared to 3 or 30 % fat controls formulated from the same meat base. Comparisons of konjac 65 MB treatments were made only with the 3 % fat control (3 C) due to "fatting out" of the 30 % fat control (30 C) during heat processing. All konjac treatments were formulated to contain 3 % fat to meet USDA nutritional labeling requirements for low-fat bologna and to be comparable to other low-fat products currently available at the retail level. Protein and fat contents, <b>expressed</b> <b>water,</b> bound water, water activity (aw), and cook yield were not different among 65 MB treatments. Percent moisture was slightly higher in KC 20 (65 MB) in comparison to 3 C and KS 20, and pH was lower in 3 C (6. 02) and higher in KS 20 (6. 15). No differences were observed in true shear stress, true shear strain, and texture profile analysis (TPA) parameters among 65 MB treatments. However, rigidity or stiffness (shear modulus, G) and sensory panel fracturability were less for KC 20 than all other treatments. In general, low-fat 70 MB samples (3 C and konjac treatments) as evaluated by torsion test, TPA, and sensory panel were harder, more rigid, springier, more cohesive and harder to fracture than 30 C. For most textural traits, KS and KC were similar, but KC tended to be slightly softer, less springy, less hard and more easily deformed than 3 C. Bologna containing either KS or KC was similar to 3 C for most traits evaluated, but quite different compositionally, texturally and color-wise from 30 C. Based on torsion analysis, 30 C was texturally similar to commercial beef bologna while konjac treatments were more similar to low-fat turkey bologna manufactured with mechanically deboned turkey meat. Fat replacements derived from the konjac/starch or konjac/carrageenan gels tested contributed positively to low-fat bologna formulations and could serve as fat mimics to reduce the caloric density of processed meat products...|$|E

For cells of different size and shape (Sf 9, MDCK, CHO, A 549, tracheal epithelia, BHK), increased cell volume was associated with decreased signal intensity; generally the signal decreased 10 – 20 % for a twofold increase in cell volume. A theory relating signal intensity to relative cell volume was developed based on spatial filtering and changes in optical path length associated with cell volume changes. Theory predictions were confirmed by signal measurements of cell layers bathed in solutions of various osmolarities and refractive indices. The excellent signal-to-noise ratio of the transmitted light detection permitted measurement of cell volume changes of < 1 %.
