40|$|The <b>starter</b> <b>unit</b> {{used in the}} {{biosynthesis}} of daunorubicin is propionyl coenzyme A (CoA) {{rather than}} acetyl-CoA, which {{is used in the}} production of most of the bacterial aromatic polyketides studied to date. In the daunorubicin biosynthesis gene cluster of Streptomyces peucetius, directly downstream of the genes encoding the β-ketoacyl:acyl carrier protein synthase subunits, are two genes, dpsC and dpsD, encoding proteins that are believed to function as the starter unit-specifying enzymes. Recombinant strains containing plasmids carrying dpsC and dpsD, in addition to other daunorubicin polyketide synthase (PKS) genes, incorporate the correct <b>starter</b> <b>unit</b> into polyketides made by these genes, suggesting that, contrary to earlier reports, the enzymes encoded by dpsC and dpsD {{play a crucial role in}} <b>starter</b> <b>unit</b> specification. Additionally, the results of a cell-free synthesis of 21 -carbon polyketides from propionyl-CoA and malonyl-CoA that used the protein extracts of recombinant strains carrying other daunorubicin PKS genes to which purified DpsC was added suggest that this enzyme has the primary role in <b>starter</b> <b>unit</b> discrimination for daunorubicin biosynthesis...|$|R

40|$|A stable-isotope assay {{was used}} to analyze the {{effectiveness}} of various perdeuterated short-chain acyl coenzyme A (acyl-CoA) compounds as <b>starter</b> <b>units</b> for straight- and branched-chain fatty acid biosynthesis in cell extracts of Streptomyces collinus. In these extracts perdeuterated isobutyryl-CoA was converted to isopalmitate (a branched-chain fatty acid), while butyryl-CoA was converted to palmitate (a straight-chain fatty acid). These observations are consistent with previous in vivo analyses of fatty acid biosynthesis in S. collinus, which suggested that butyryl-CoA and isobutyryl-CoA function as <b>starter</b> <b>units</b> for palmitate and isopalmitate biosynthesis, respectively. Additionally, in vitro analysis demonstrated that acetyl-CoA can function as a <b>starter</b> <b>unit</b> for palmitate biosynthesis. Palmitate biosynthesis and isopalmitate biosynthesis in these cell extracts were both effectively inhibited by thiolactomycin, a known type II fatty acid synthase inhibitor. In vivo experiments demonstrated that concentrations of thiolactomycin ranging from 0. 1 to 0. 2 mg/ml produced both a dramatic decrease in the cellular levels of branched-chain fatty acids and a surprising three- to fivefold increase in the cellular levels of the straight-chain fatty acids palmitate and myristate. Additional in vivo incorporation studies with perdeuterated butyrate suggested that, in accord with the in vitro studies, the biosynthesis of the palmitate from butyryl-CoA decreases in the presence of thiolactomycin. In contrast, in vivo incorporation studies with perdeuterated acetate demonstrated that the biosynthesis of palmitate from acetyl-CoA increases in the presence of thiolactomycin. These observations clearly demonstrate that isobutyryl-CoA is a <b>starter</b> <b>unit</b> for isopalmitate biosynthesis and that either acetyl-CoA or butyryl-CoA can be a <b>starter</b> <b>unit</b> for palmitate biosynthesis in S. collinus. However, the pathway for palmitate biosynthesis from acetyl-CoA is less sensitive to thiolactomycin, and it is suggested that the basis for this difference is in the initiation step...|$|R

The scheme allowed detecting 36 sequence types with a discriminatory index of 0. 98. The whole population was clustered in four deeply branched lineages, in which the dairy strains were spread. Moreover, the dairy strains could exhibit a high diversity within these lineages, leading to an overall dairy population with a diversity level as high as that of the nondairy population.

Incorporation studies with perdeuterated valine were consistent with these being generated using methylbutyryl-CoA and isobutyryl-CoA as <b>starter</b> <b>units,</b> respectively. Plasmid-based expression of a streptomycete fabH in the SJM 1 mutant led to restoration of overall prodiginine titers but the same overall ratio of undecylprodiginines and novel prodiginines.

40|$|Coronatine is a {{phytotoxin}} {{produced by}} Pseudomonas syringae spp. that infect {{a number of}} commercially important crops. Coronatine is composed of a cyclopropyl amino acid, coronamic acid, and a novel polyketide, coronafacic acid (CFA). This work discloses (1) chemical and (2) biological approaches towards understanding CFA biosynthesis. 1. It was previously known that CFA is assembled from a pyruvate, a butyrate, and three acetate units, but the mode of pyruvate incorporation was obscure. Precursor incorporation experiments with labeled forms of glutamate have now shown that pyruvate is incorporated only after its conversion {{to one of the}} <b>starter</b> <b>units,</b> alpha-ketoglutarate, succinic semialdehyde, or glutamate. It was hypothesized that polyketide chain extension of one of these <b>starter</b> <b>units</b> with an acetate unit followed by first ring cyclization would give 2 -cyclopenten- 1 -one 2 -carboxylic acid (CPC). This could be extended with a butyrate unit to give 2 -[1 -oxo- 2 -cyclopenten- 2 -ylmethyl]butanoic acid (CPE), a compound previously isolated from P. syringae culture broths. Finally, chain extension with an acetate unit and closure of the second ring would give CFA. This model of CFA biosynthesis (<b>starter</b> <b>unit</b> → CPC → CPE → CFA) has been tested by precursor incorporation experiments involving labeled forms of succinic semialdehyde and CPC. In addition, several synthetic routes to CPE have also been explored. 2. The nucleotide sequence of the remaining unsequenced region of the CFA biosynthetic gene cluster was completed in this work. Analysis revealed the presence of two large ORFs, cfa 6 and cfa 7, whose gene products show homologies to type I polyketide synthases (PKSs). Previous work had demonstrated the presence of a type II PKS in the CFA cluster, including two adenylating enzymes (Cfl and Cfa 5) and a thioesterase (Cfa 9). Consideration of all the putative enzymatic activities of the CFA cluster (Cfl and Cfa 1 [...] Cfa 9) has allowed a refinement of the earlier biosynthetic model, in which a good correlation exists between the enzymatic activities present and the putative biochemical steps of the earlier model (<b>starter</b> <b>unit</b> → CPC → CPE → CFA).

40|$|Sorghum bicolor is {{considered}} to be an allelopathic crop species, producing phytotoxins such as the lipid benzoquinone sorgoleone, which likely accounts for many of the allelopathic properties of Sorghum spp. Current evidence suggests that sorgoleone biosynthesis occurs exclusively in root hair cells and involves the production of an alkylresorcinolic intermediate (5 -[(Z,Z) - 82 ̆ 7, 112 ̆ 7, 142 ̆ 7 -pentadecatrienyl]resorcinol) derived from an unusual 16 : 3 D 9, 12, 15 fatty acyl-CoA <b>starter</b> <b>unit.</b> This led to the suggestion of the involvement of one or more alkylresorcinol synthases (ARSs), type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) that produce 5 -alkylresorcinols using medium to long-chain fatty acyl-CoA <b>starter</b> <b>units</b> via iterative condensations with malonyl-CoA. In an effort to characterize the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the pentadecyl resorcinol intermediate, a previously described expressed sequence tag database prepared from isolated S. bicolor (genotype BTx 623) root hairs was first mined for all PKS-like sequences. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed that three of these sequences were preferentially expressed in root hairs, two of which (designated ARS 1 and ARS 2) were found to encode ARS enzymes capable of accepting a variety of fatty acyl-CoA <b>starter</b> <b>units</b> in recombinant enzyme studies. Furthermore, RNA interference experiments directed against ARS 1 and ARS 2 resulted in the generation of multiple independent transformant events exhibiting dramatically reduced sorgoleone levels. Thus, both ARS 1 and ARS 2 are likely to participate in the biosynthesis of sorgoleone in planta. The sequences of ARS 1 and ARS 2 were also used to identify several rice (Oryza sativa) genes encoding ARSs, which are likely involved in the production of defense-related alkylresorcinols...|$|R

The hydrolysis of the N-acetylcysteamine thioesters of racemic 2 -methylbutyric acid confirmed the stereospecificity of the avermectin loading AT for an S configuration at the C- 2 position of the substrate.

40|$|Polyketides and {{fatty acids}} (FAs) are {{naturally}} produced molecules, which are both biosynthesized from acyl-CoA building blocks and have similar enzymatic machinery. However, the structures {{and functions of}} polyketides and fatty acids are very different. Polyketides are secondary metabolites {{that have been used}} as pharmaceuticals and leads in drug discovery, whereas fatty acids are the components of cell membranes and have roles as signaling molecules. The goal of this dissertation is {{to gain a better understanding}} of how the enzymes in type II polyketide synthases (PKSs) and fatty acid synthases (FASs) generate their diverse products. Type II PKSs generate reactive poly-!-ketone intermediates, which are regiospecifically cyclized and aromatized by aromatase/cyclase (ARO/CYCs) enzymes. In Chapter 2, the structural and functional studies of two functionally divergent di-domain ARO/CYCs are discussed. This work reveals the role of each domain in these di-domain enzymes, and identifies residues in the active site pockets that are important for catalysis. Type II PKSs typically have an acetyl-starter unit; however, some polyketide natural products exist that contain non-acetate <b>starter</b> <b>units.</b> The incorporation of non-acetate <b>starter</b> <b>unit</b> adds molecular diversity to the poly-!-ketone scaffold. DpsC is the enzyme responsible for the enzymatic incorporation of a propionyl <b>starter</b> <b>unit</b> during daunorubicin biosynthesis. Structural studies of DpsC that reveal insight into its mechanism and substrate specificity are discussed in Chapter 3. AuaEII is the CoA-ligase responsible for the generation of anthranoyl-CoA, which is used as a <b>starter</b> <b>unit</b> during the biosynthesis of a class of hybrid type II polyketides named the aurachins. Chapter 4 discusses the crystal structure of AuaEII and its implications for <b>starter</b> <b>unit</b> specificity of the aurachin biosynthesis pathway. An additional enzymatic strategy to generate structural diversity in type II polyketide natural products is polyketide oxidation. BE- 7585 A is a type II polyketide natural product that is proposed to catalyze an oxidative rearrangement during biosynthesis. The FAD/NADPH-dependent oxygenase BexE is proposed to catalyze this oxidation. The crystal structure and initial in vitro characterization of BexE are discussed in Chapter 5. The acyl carrier protein AcpP plays a central role in type II FA biosynthesis in E. coli. AcpP carries the nascent FA chain and delivers intermediates into the active sites of over 12 other enzymes during FA biosynthesis. The protein-protein interactions between AcpP and its target enzymes are transient, and this has hampered efforts to gain information about how AcpP interacts with target enzymes. Chapter 6 describes the application of mechanism-based crosslinkers to generate stable complexes between AcpP and two different partner enzymes: the dehydratase FabA and the ketosynthase FabB. Comparative analysis of the AcpP=FabA and AcpP=FabB crystal structures reveals differential AcpP interactions with partner enzymes during FA biosynthesis. This work serves as a basis for engineering protein-protein interactions to modulate the affinity of AcpP for different partner enzymes and alter fatty acid profiles in vivo for biofuel production...|$|R

Understanding the biochemistry of tetracycline PKSs is {{an important}} step toward the rational and combinatorial manipulation of tetracycline biosynthesis. To this end, we have sequenced the gene cluster of oxytetracycline (oxy and otc genes) PKS genes from Streptomyces rimosus. Sequence analysis revealed a total of 21 genes between the otrA and otrB resistance genes. We hypothesized that an amidotransferase, OxyD, synthesizes the malonamate <b>starter</b> <b>unit</b> that is a universal building block for tetracycline compounds. In vivo reconstitution using strain CH 999 revealed that the minimal PKS and OxyD are necessary and sufficient for the biosynthesis of amidated polyketides.

WJ 35 is an isoquinolone compound derived from an amidated decaketide backbone and cyclized with novel regioselectivity.
