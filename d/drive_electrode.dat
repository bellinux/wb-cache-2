40|$|The {{effects of}} the gas {{pressure}} (pg), microcavity height (t), Au vapor addition, and microwave frequency on the properties of three-dimensional confined microwave-induced microplasmas were discussed in light of simulation results of a glow microdischarge in a three-dimensional microcavity (diameter dh = 1000 μm) driven at constant voltage loading on the <b>drive</b> <b>electrode</b> (Vrf) of 180 V. The simulation was performed using the PIC/MCC method, whose results were experimentally verified. In all the cases we investigated in this study, the microplasmas were in the γ-mode. When pg increased, the maximum electron (ne) or ion density (nAr+) distributions turned narrow {{and close to the}} discharge gap due to the decrease in the mean free path of the secondary electron emission (SEE) electrons (λSEE-e). The peak ne and nAr+ were not a monotonic function of pg, resulting from the two conflicting effects of pg on ne and nAr+. The impact of ions on the electrode was enhanced when pg increased. This was determined after comparing the results of ion energy distribution function (IEDFs) at various pg. The effects of t on the peaks and distributions of ne and nAr+ were negligible in the range of t from 1. 0 to 3. 0 mm. The minimum t of 0. 6 mm for a steady glow discharge was predicted for pg of 800 Pa and Vrf of 180 V. The Au vapor addition increased the peaks of ne and nAr+, due to the lower ionization voltage of Au atom. The acceleration of ions in the sheaths was intensified with the addition of Au vapor because of the increased potential difference in the sheath at the <b>drive</b> <b>electrode...</b>|$|E

One obvious constraint is to limit the maximum Ohmic power dissipated in the body. Current patterns optimising distinguishability with respect to this constraint are singular functions of the difference of transconductance matrices with respect to the power norm. (the optimal currents of Isaacson). If one constrains the total current (L 1 norm) the optimal patterns are pair drives. On the other hand if one constrains the maximum current on each <b>drive</b> <b>electrode</b> (an L ∞ norm), the optimal patterns have each drive channel set to the maximum source or sink current value. In this paper we consider appropriate safety constraints and discuss how to find the optimal current patterns with those constraints. ...|$|E

We have built a fairly simple model of the arc, which satisfies the above requirements. The model is designed for the analysis of electromagnetic processes arc of varying length. We have compared the results obtained when testing the model with the results obtained on actual furnaces. Results. During melting in real chipboard under the influence of changes in temperature changes its properties arc plasma. The proposed model takes into account these changes.

40|$|Wastewater {{treatment}} technology {{is undergoing a}} transformation due to more restrictive regulations governing the dischar ge and disposal of hazardous pollutants. Electrochemical based technologies are very promising methods for treating wastewaters containing organic and inorganic pollutants resistant to biological processes or toxic for microorganisms. These methods present numerous advantages including the utilisation of a green reagent such as the electron, very high removal of numerous recalcitrant pollutants, efficient disinfection, high flexibility and no necessity to transport or stock chemical oxidants or reducents. O n the other hand, a wide utilisation of such methods {{is likely to be}} limited by: (i) the cost of electric energy necessary to <b>drive</b> <b>electrode</b> reactions; (ii) the cost of the supporting electrolyte for waste waters with no adequate conductibility and (iii), for some applications, by the cost of electrodic materials. In order to overcome some of these drawbacks, some innovative solutions were proposed in the last years such as the utilization of micro reactors to avoid the utilization of supporting electrolyt es and to increase the current efficiencies for electrochemical processes controlled by mass transport stages such as direct oxidation processes or electro - Fenton (EF). To avoid the supply of electric energy to the system also the utilization of microbial fuel cells or reverse electrodialysis processes was proposed. Reverse electrodialysis is a clean, renewable energy with large global potential since the electricity is produced from supplies of water with different salt concentrations. In reverse electrod ialysis (RED), cation and anion conductive membranes are placed in an alternating way in order to produce dilute and concentrate compartments. The salt concentration difference (salt gradient) between both compartments in the cell pair creates a Nernst pot ential across the cell pair which causes an electrical current to flow through the electrical load connected to the electrodes. The electrochemical treatment of two different kinds of waste waters contaminated by Cr(VI) and a model dye, the Acid Orange 7 (AO 7), respectively, driven by reverse electrodialysis processes was studied. It was shown that in both cases salinity gradients can be used to obtain electric energy and to successfully treat contaminated waste waters...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrokinetic}} {{method used}} for remediation of soil contaminated with heavy metals {{is a new}} developing technique for cleaning soil from heavy metals and radionuclides. By feeding an electric current through soil one induces movement of charges, which is generated by migration of ions and colloids in water present in pores and by reductive reactions {{on the surface of}} electrodes. The aim of the present investigation was to find out whether the electrokinetic soil cleaning method is suitable for cleanup of polluted soils. The method utilizes electrokinesis to drive contaminant species into and through a bed adjacent to a <b>drive</b> <b>electrode.</b> The bed comprises a moderately electrically conductive adsorbent material which is porous and is infused with water or other solvent capable of conducting electrical current. The efficiency of the method depends not so much on soil permeability as on the electric conductivity of water in pores and the distance of movement. The major task and the key goal were to determine suitability of the electrokinetic method for the treatment of soil contaminated with heavy metals (Cr, Cu, Mn, Ni, Zn and Pb). Also, it was important to determine the maximum level of cleanup, dependence on the voltage, the level of soil pollution for which this remediation method would prove to be effective for cleaning soil down to the permitted pollution limits, the type of soil most suitable for this remediation technique, the materials of the electrodes, etc. The electrokinetic method is most effective when cleaning polluted sand and sandy loam. The highest efficiency and smallest residual concentrations were reached when removing manganese and chromium from soil. A higher cleaning efficiency is reached applying 29 V rather than 24 V voltage. However, results were quite similar, therefore to clean soil from heavy metals the standard 24 V voltage could be applied, but the cleaning process should be prolonged.

It is found that the phase shift θ between the high (or low) frequency source and the pulse modulation has a great influence on the ion density and the ionization rate.

A detailed investigation of the temporal evolution of the plasma characteristics indicates that several high frequency harmonics can be excited at the initial stage of a pulse period by tuning the phase shift θ, and this gives rise to strong sheath oscillations, and therefore high ionization rates. For comparison, the pulsing of the low frequency source is also studied.
