500|$|McCoy is {{a member}} of the Church of Christ and {{attended}} Westover Hills Church of Christ in Austin, Texas. When living in Buffalo Gap, he attended and was very involved with the Oldham Lane Church of Christ. McCoy has participated in a church youth group since 2002. His work has included landscaping yards for the elderly, visiting nursing homes, helping with meals on wheels, and ministry. Fellow quarterback Tim Tebow said of McCoy, [...] "I was really proud of <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> think he represents college football and his faith extremely well, too, which I really respect as well. I think he's done a good job with everything he's going through." [...] McCoy was selected to welcome President George W. Bush home to Texas after his second term ended on January 20, 2009.|$|E
500|$|In {{a comment}} {{published}} on 1 December 2013 in The Independent {{in response to}} supporters' chants and banners of [...] "City Till (sic) We Die", Allam said, [...] "They can die {{as soon as they}} want, as long as they leave the club for the majority who just want to watch good football." [...] The supporters responded with chants of [...] "We're Hull City, we'll die when we want" [...] during that day's home match against Liverpool. Manager Steve Bruce credited the controversy for creating [...] " [...] a fantastic atmosphere" [...] but added, [...] "I have got to have a conversation with <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't think he quite understands what it means in terms of history and tradition." [...] However, Bruce also said that, because of the money Allam had invested in the club, [...] "If he thinks Hull Tigers is his way forward then we have to respect it." ...|$|E
500|$|He led the NHL {{in assists}} three times – 1992–93, 2000–01 and 2001–02 – and {{finished}} in the top ten on 12 occasions. He is also the only player in NHL history to centre three 50-goal scorers, helping Brett Hull, Cam Neely and Peter Bondra reach the mark. [...] His teammates praised his consistency, noting that Oates continued to score points at an elite level when he did not have star players as linemates. [...] Boston teammate Raymond Bourque suggested in 1994 that Oates was underrated: [...] "I {{think a lot of people}} take what he does for granted. He does it in a quiet way. He's not a flashy guy. He's not looking for attention, he just goes out and does it. He's the best centerman I've been around. I never knew he was this good playing against <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't see him this much." [...] Oates was able to score himself, reaching the 20 goal mark five times, including a career high 45 in 1992–93, a season in which he led the league with 11 game-winning goals.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{would advise}} {{me to be}} on my guard against <b>him,</b> <b>because,</b> {{although}} <b>I</b> look twenty-five and experienced, I am only nineteen and inexperienced. Thank you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I sent <b>him</b> away <b>because</b> <b>I</b> loved him,' she said, 'and because, {{after what}} had happened, {{he could never}} be certain that I loved him. Can you {{understand}} that?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Which {{means that}} you want the dog, must have him, {{and are going to}} got <b>him,</b> just <b>because</b> <b>I</b> can afford to do it for you," [...] he teased.|$|R
500|$|Solti {{described}} {{his father as}} [...] "a kind, sweet man who trusted everyone. He shouldn't have, but he did. Jews in Hungary were tremendously patriotic. In 1914, when war broke out, my father invested most of his money in a war loan to help the country. By the time the bonds matured, they were worthless." [...] Mor Stern was a religious man, but his son was less so. Late in life Solti recalled, [...] "I often upset <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> never stayed in the synagogue for longer than ten minutes." [...] Teréz Stern was from a musical family, and encouraged her daughter Lilly, eight years the elder of the children, to sing, and György to accompany her at the piano. Solti remembered, [...] "I made so many mistakes, but it was invaluable experience for an opera conductor. I learnt to swim with her." [...] He was not a diligent student of the piano: [...] "My mother kept telling me to practise, but what ten-year-old wants {{to play the piano}} when he could be out playing football?" ...|$|E
500|$|On 8 August 2010, Robinson {{retired from}} {{international}} football with immediate effect, despite having been selected for a friendly against Hungary. He said about his retirement, [...] "Only now have I {{been able to}} make this decision as previously I haven't been in contention for selection, I don't see myself as a number three or four keeper and find that role very frustrating," [...] while Allardyce backed his decision, stating, [...] "As my player, I support <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> see him week in, week out and know how well he has performed. It's a big decision he's made, but I understand it." [...] In his international career, Robinson had won 41 caps for England, 25 of which came in competitive international matches (either the qualification or final rounds of the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship). Despite Steve Kean stating that England should recall him in March 2012, Robinson stated that he had no interest in a return later that month. In February 2014, Robinson said that he would be open to an international return for the 2014 FIFA World Cup if England manager Roy Hodgson decided to recall him.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote him, that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for <b>him,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He is down on {{me because}} we have stopped trading with <b>him,</b> and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> won't work for him for {{starvation}} wages," [...] retorted Ralph. [...] "He is a mean skinflint, and half the village knows it." ...|$|R
60|$|And why? What reason can he give why God should save <b>him?</b> <b>Because,</b> he says, <b>I</b> {{have sought}} Thy commandments.|$|R
6000|$|... "Will {{you let me}} return to-morrow,--just for a few days,--and {{then you}} can talk to him as you please. I did not mean to come to stay. <b>I</b> wished <b>him</b> good-bye <b>because</b> <b>I</b> knew that I should not meet him here." ...|$|R
500|$|When {{asked about}} Barris's claim {{of being a}} CIA assassin, Clooney commented, [...] "I don't know how much I {{believed}} it. I didn't want to officially ask <b>him,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' I wanted {{to tell the story}} and I thought how interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris would have to do that. I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when I was growing up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and knew what it looked like and smelled like. And I know something about some of the trappings of fame, so I thought I had a unique take on it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Martin {{himself said}} of his {{partnership}} with Bryson in May 2014: [...] "I think people must hate playing against <b>him,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> certainly would. I wouldn't want to mark him. People can't stay with him, he's got that much energy. From my point of view, he helps my game, because he takes people away and runs in behind. It {{makes it easier for}} me to play, because he's always there next to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Pete Willis of Def Leppard {{was seen}} as another major {{influence}} for Darrell. In his Guitar World magazine tribute issue, Abbott was quoted as saying, [...] "Man, that first Leppard album really jams, and their original guitarist, Pete Willis, was a great player. I was inspired by <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was a small young dude {{and he was a}} small young dude, too—and he was out there kickin' ass. He made me want {{to get out there and}} play. Def Leppard used the two-guitar thing much more back then than they do now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you were}} to ask me where is the {{necessity}} of my hate for such as Haldin, I would answer you--there is nothing sentimental in it. I did not hate <b>him</b> <b>because</b> he had committed the crime of murder. Abhorrence is not hate. <b>I</b> hated <b>him</b> simply <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am sane. It is in that character that he outraged me. His death..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is {{a certain}} tutor, of whom I have some knowledge, who I think might suit the purpose," [...] said Mr. Jaggers. [...] "I don't {{recommend}} <b>him,</b> observe; <b>because</b> <b>I</b> never recommend anybody. The gentleman I speak of is one Mr. Matthew Pocket." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't run <b>him</b> down <b>because</b> {{he is not}} a gentleman," [...] Harry said. [...] "I run <b>him</b> down <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't {{like his}} face; and if he were the son of a duke instead of the son of a mayor I should dislike it just as much. You take my word for it, Ernest, that's a bad fellow." ...|$|R
2500|$|Victoire Pisa {{returned}} to Japan {{at the end}} of the year but was unable to reproduce his early season form. He finished thirteenth behind Buena Vista in the Japan Cup and eighth behind Orfevre in the Arima Kinen. He was retired from racing {{at the end of}} December. Sumii commented on the colt's retirement by saying that [...] "I feel I should apologise to <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> couldn't get him back to his best but at least I am happy that I can send him to the stud without any further accidents". Victoire Pisa was named Japanese Champion Older Male for 2011.|$|E
2500|$|... "I shot <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{thought he}} was {{breaking}} up my home," [...] Wanger told {{the chief of police}} of Beverly Hills. He was booked on suspicion of assault with intent to commit murder. Bennett denied a romance, however. [...] "But if Walter thinks the relationships between Mr. Lang and myself are romantic or anything but strictly business, he is wrong," [...] she declared. She blamed the trouble on financial setbacks involving film productions Wanger was involved with, and said he {{was on the verge of}} a nervous breakdown. The following day Wanger, out on bond, returned to their Holmby Hills home, collected his belongings and moved. Bennett, however, said there would not be a divorce.|$|E
2500|$|With {{his poor}} shanty town upbringing, Maradona has {{cultivated}} {{a man of}} the people persona. During a meeting with Pope John Paul II at the Vatican in 1987, they clashed on the issue of wealth disparity, with Maradona stating, [...] "I argued with <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was in the Vatican and I saw all these golden ceilings and afterwards I heard the Pope say the Church was worried about the welfare of poor kids. Sell your ceiling then amigo, do something!" [...] In September 2014, Maradona met with Pope Francis in Rome, crediting Francis for inspiring him to return to religion after many years; he stated, [...] "We should all imitate Pope Francis. If each one of us gives something to someone else, no one in the world would be starving." ...|$|E
6000|$|He lighted {{his pipe}} when Wilkinson started his team, and {{presently}} remarked: [...] "On the whole, I'm glad you headed <b>him</b> off, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> might have gone. You mean well, Stephen, but that man doesn't like you, and I've sometimes thought he doesn't like Sadie." ...|$|R
60|$|Ah! thought Ethel, {{it suits}} {{me as well}} as the children. I have a great giant on Cocksmoor, and here I am, not allowed to attack <b>him,</b> <b>because,</b> perhaps, <b>I</b> am not minding my sheep, and letting my lion and my bear run loose about the house.|$|R
6000|$|Stoller gulped and did {{not answer}} at once. Then he said, [...] "I stand by what I done. I'm {{not going to let}} him say I turned him down for doing what <b>I</b> told <b>him</b> to, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> hadn't the sense to know what I was about." ...|$|R
2500|$|Botham {{also had}} a holiday home nearby in Alderney and during {{the last seven years}} of Arlott's life they often had two meals a day {{together}} when he was staying on the island. [...] "At six minutes past nine every morning the phone would ring. John would say, 'C'mon over — and bring your thirst with you.' At the end when the emphysema took over and he was struggling with speech he had an oxygen mask and I often had to empty his bag for him. But he liked me being there because I knew to wait and let him finish his sentences between gasps. I didn't try to say the words for <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> knew how much they mattered. That was strange for me – to be patient and quiet. But I always wanted to listen to John." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 29, 2011, Zuckerberg made a {{surprise}} guest appearance on Saturday Night Live, which was being hosted by Jesse Eisenberg. They both {{said it was}} the first time they ever met. Eisenberg asked Zuckerberg, who had been critical of his portrayal by the film, what he thought of the movie. Zuckerberg replied, [...] "It was interesting." [...] In a subsequent interview about their meeting, Eisenberg explains that he was [...] "nervous to meet <b>him,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had spent now, a year and a half thinking about him..." [...] He adds, [...] "Mark has been so gracious about something that’s really so uncomfortable... The fact that he would do SNL and make fun of the situation is so sweet and so generous. It’s the best possible way to handle something that, I think, could otherwise be very uncomfortable." ...|$|E
2500|$|In March 2011, {{when asked}} about the album's musical {{direction}} in an interview with gossip website Dean Piper's World, Goulding stated, [...] "It's started to sound very dark and very weird. This album is going to be even more emotional [...] I wanted to make it so there is hope. I want to make an effect whether it's happy or sad." [...] Goulding added, [...] "This album for me is a journey from dark into light from confusion to understanding [...] I didn't set out to write a break-up record but I think it became one." [...] In an interview with MTV News on 29 August 2012, Goulding elaborated on the sound of the album, saying, [...] "I've moved on quite a bit since the first album, because I've discovered so much; I've learned a lot more and I've grown up a lot more. I've gained more influences and different influences and people have influenced it; I suppose just circumstances. It's a bit more tribal and anthemic; a bit more piano and vocal than anything. The last album was very electronic, but it was tied in with my voice; this one, to me, is way more of a pop record." [...] Goulding revealed to The Sun that her former relationship with BBC Radio 1 DJ Greg James provided inspiration for the album, stating, [...] "The last record I felt like I was singing about stuff like that and I thought it was really sincere but I listen back and I think, God that was really naive, that was nothing. This time it's the real deal. There's stuff about Greg. I played it to <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> felt that was better than him hearing it randomly somewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Was he? Well, so am I to Cyril, and he to me. We wouldn't be {{unreasonable}} if it wasn't--wasn't necessary. Talk, to Cyril, Auntie; then you'll understand. There he is; only, don't keep <b>him</b> long, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> want <b>him.</b> Oh! Auntie; I {{want him}} so badly!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I told <b>him</b> to come <b>because</b> <b>I</b> thought you'd like it, but {{if there}} isn't room he can go away again," [...] said Nat, sorrowfully.|$|R
6000|$|... "He has not {{breathed a}} word. He has not {{attempted}} to; {{but if he}} did, I would not let <b>him,</b> <b>because,</b> you see, <b>I</b> do not love him." ...|$|R
60|$|But I did not heed <b>him,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{was looking}} at the Lord God.|$|E
60|$|I {{knew the}} {{question}} absurd. I asked it of <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted him to}} ask it of me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't kill <b>him</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{threw away}} my sword," [...] said the other. [...] "I {{did it on}} purpose--or I'm not sure what might have happened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "To-day I made <b>him</b> like Stanley, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{think that}} is what papa would like him to be; and {{yesterday}} he was papa, and I was his coachman." ...|$|R
500|$|... "If the {{director}} tells the producer {{that he wants}} 50 camels, the latter will probably say, 'Why not 25? Can't you manage with 25 camels?' Whereas, if he is telling me the same thing... I will not waste time asking <b>him</b> questions <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am also creatively aware why he needs them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thou knowest {{that evil}} man's true name,' he replied, 'but I {{have chosen to}} call <b>him</b> Fulke <b>because</b> <b>I</b> promised <b>him</b> I would not {{tell the story of}} his wickedness so that any man might guess it. I have changed all the names in my tale. His {{children}}'s children may be still alive.' ...|$|R
