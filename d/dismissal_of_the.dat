5|$|In the Republic of the Congo, newly {{independent}} from Belgium since June 1960, the CIA-cultivated President Joseph Kasa-Vubu ordered the <b>dismissal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> democratically elected Prime Minister Patrice Lumumba and the Lumumba cabinet in September; Lumumba called for Kasa-Vubu's dismissal instead. In the ensuing Congo Crisis, the CIA-backed Colonel Mobutu Sese Seko quickly mobilized his forces to seize power through {{a military coup}} d'état.|$|E
5|$|The {{voting on}} the next issues was {{continued}} to be conducted without the utilization of the electronic counting system by showing hands. For the dismissal of Yanukovych all 226 parliamentarians registered in the session hall voted approvingly. The same results were obtained for the <b>dismissal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> current Cabinet of Ministers. For the appointment {{of the new government}} 227 parliamentarians raised their hands that afternoon.|$|E

5|$|After new {{parliamentary}} elections were called for 1993, Dar {{ran for a}} seat in the National Assembly of Pakistan from Lahore NA-95 constituency in by-election after the seat was vacated by Nawaz Sharif and was successfully elected for the first time by obtaining 39,483 votes as a candidate of PML (N). His tenure as Member of the National Assembly was terminated after the dissolution of the National Assembly in 1996 due to the <b>dismissal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Benazir Bhutto government by then President of Pakistan Farooq Leghari.|$|E
5|$|Although {{reviews in}} the birding and ornithological press {{have often been}} favourable, there have been criticisms. Peter Kennerley, author and Asian bird expert, {{considered}} {{that some of the}} illustrations are small and garish or technically inaccurate. He also believes that the over-reliance on sometimes very old museum specimens and <b>dismissal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wealth of observational data filed by amateur travelling birders is a mistake, and states that many of the taxonomic decisions appear to be random choices, unsupported by published research.|$|E
5|$|Belgium's 1920 Olympic squad {{was given}} a bye into the quarter-finals, where they won 3–1 against Spain, and reached the semi-finals, where they beat the Netherlands 3–0. In {{the first half of}} their final against Czechoslovakia, the Belgians led 2–0. Forward Robert Coppée {{converted}} a disputed early penalty, and the action in which attacker Henri Larnoe doubled the score was also a matter of debate. After the <b>dismissal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Czechoslovak left-back Karel Steiner, the discontented visitors left the pitch in the 40th minute. Afterwards, the away team reported their reasons for protest to the Olympic organisation; these complaints were dismissed and the Czechoslovaks were disqualified. The 2–0 score was allowed to stand and Belgium were crowned the champions.|$|E
50|$|His {{theories}} {{were widely}} influential for many practiticians, like Karl Henrici and Theodor Fischer. Modernist movements rejected these thoughts and Le Corbusier {{is known for}} his energetic <b>dismissals</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> work. Nevertheless, his work is often used and cited as a criticism <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Modernist movement, its importance reemerging in <b>the</b> post-modernist movement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> late sixties.|$|R

5|$|Kochanowski {{was born}} in 1530 into a prosperous noble family. In his youth he studied at the {{universities}} of Kraków, Königsberg and Padua and traveled extensively in Europe. He worked for a time as a royal secretary, and then settled {{in the village of}} Czarnolas, a part of his family inheritance. Kochanowski's multifaceted creative output is remarkable for both the depth of thoughts and feelings that he shares with the reader, and for its beauty and classic perfection of form. Among Kochanowski's best known works are bucolic Frascas (trifles), epic poetry, religious lyrics, drama-tragedy The <b>Dismissal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek Envoys, and the most highly regarded Threnodies or laments, written {{after the death of his}} young daughter.|$|E
5|$|New {{parliamentary}} elections were called for 24 October 1990.

He received 80,305 votes against 54,011 votes for PPP candidate Raja Muhammad Anwar. Upon the victory of IJI in the 1990 national election, he was made Parliamentary Secretary for Defence, a post he retained until {{the dissolution of the}} National Assembly in April 1993 with the <b>dismissal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Nawaz Sharif government by then President Ghulam Ishaq Khan.|$|E

5|$|Ten {{truckloads of}} bridge {{defenders}} {{were taken to}} jail and an estimated 500people were arrested in the city. Seventeen of the 47 professors at Huế University, who had resigned {{earlier in the week}} in protest against the <b>dismissal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rector Cao Văn Luân, a Catholic priest and opponent of Archbishop Thục (elder brother of Diệm and Nhu) were also arrested. The raids were repeated in cities and towns across the country. The total number of dead and disappeared was never confirmed, but estimates range up to several hundred. At least 1,400 were arrested.|$|E
5|$|The {{first to}} file suit over the {{election}} was Judge William M. Harrison, {{who had been on}} the Brooks ticket. He filed a Bill of Equity with the US Circuit Court in Little Rock, claiming he had a right to a seat on the Supreme Court due to the fraudulent election. The Brooks Campaign likewise filed suit in the Circuit Court shortly thereafter on January 7, 1873. Judge H.C. Caldwell heard the Harrison case, and rendered an opinion stating that the Federal Court had no jurisdiction in the matter, and dismissed the case. The Harrison decision resulted in the <b>dismissal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brooks case as well.|$|E
5|$|The five {{attorneys}} {{who volunteered to}} defend the communists were familiar with leftist causes and supported the defendants' rights to espouse socialist viewpoints. They were Abraham Isserman, George W. Crockett Jr., Richard Gladstein, Harry Sacher, and Louis F. McCabe. Attorney Maurice Sugar participated in an advisory role. Defendant Eugene Dennis represented himself. The ACLU was dominated by anti-communist leaders during the 1940s, and did not enthusiastically support persons indicted under the Smith Act; but it did submit an amicus brief endorsing a motion for <b>dismissal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> charges.|$|E

50|$|As an {{independent}} legal action {{and as a}} second option, a compensation payment may be requested within a separate court procedure. A prerequisite for that is a court decision as to <b>the</b> illegality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>dismissal.</b> <b>The</b> amount <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compensation payment due amounts to the gross salary for the month preceding <b>the</b> <b>dismissal</b> (Art. 228(1) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LC). The compensation payment is payable {{for a period of}} 6 months.|$|R
5|$|Abbasi's {{political}} career began {{after the death}} of his father Khaqan Abbasi in 1988. In May 1988, President Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq sacked the government of his handpicked Prime Minister Muhammad Khan Junejo, and prematurely dissolved the National Assembly. Consequently, new parliamentary elections were called for 16 November 1988. Abbasi ran for the National Assembly seat from Constituency NA-36 (Rawalpindi-I), which had been held by his father until his death. Abassi was elected with 47,295 votes as an independent candidate. He acquired Rawalpindi's National Assembly seat for the first time at the age of 30 by defeating both Raja Zafar ul Haq, a candidate of Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI), and Pakistan Peoples Party (PPP) candidate Raja Muhammad Anwar by a narrow margin. After winning the election he joined the IJI, which was newly founded in September 1988 by then Director-General of Inter-Services Intelligence to counter the PPP. His tenure as a Member of the National Assembly terminated after the National Assembly was dissolved prematurely in August 1990 following the <b>dismissal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> government of Benazir Bhutto by President Ghulam Ishaq Khan.|$|E
5|$|After Lukashenko {{assumed the}} {{presidency}} in 1994, he stated his intention to amend the recently passed Constitution. The amendments, according to Lukashenko, would expand {{the power of his}} office, marking a turning point in post-Soviet era politics in Belarus. A May 1995 national referendum was {{the first step in the}} amendment process. Out of the four questions, one asked if the president could disband parliament if the members violate national law. The vote, which several Supreme Soviet deputies protested, resulted in 77% in favor of the provision regarding the <b>dismissal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> legislature by the president. Other questions on the ballot, such as the national flag and national emblem, didn't affect the Constitution as a whole, but their status has been decided by the Constitution. Two years later, Lukashenko scheduled the first referendum that would potentially alter the Constitution. The last referendum on the Constitution occurred in 2004, also scheduled by Lukashenko.|$|E
5|$|Contrary to its {{misleading}} title, the Manifesto of the Sixteen {{had originally}} fifteen signatories—among them {{some of the}} most eminent anarchists in Europe—and was later countersigned by another hundred. The position of the Manifesto was in stark contrast to that of most anarchists of the day, many of whom denounced its signatories and their sympathizers, and accused them of betraying anarchist principles. In the fallout over the war, Kropotkin became increasingly isolated, with many former friends cutting their ties to him. The Russian anarchist movement was split into two, with a faction supporting Kropotkin's position to the strong criticism of the Bolsheviks. Elsewhere in Europe, including in the Spanish and Swiss anarchist movements, the <b>dismissal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Manifesto was overwhelming, with supporters being angrily denounced and marginalized.|$|E

50|$|Executive {{government}} is expressly placed in <b>the</b> hands <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prime Minister and <b>the</b> Council <b>of</b> Ministers. <b>The</b> duties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> President are mostly ceremonial; for example, <b>the</b> appointment and <b>dismissal</b> <b>of</b> ministers is <b>the</b> formal responsibility <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Prime Minister alone.|$|R

5|$|In October 2013, hip-hop artist Daz Dillinger {{issued a}} {{cease and desist}} letter to Rockstar Games and Take Two Interactive for {{allegedly}} using two of his songs without authorisation. American television personality Karen Gravano of the reality television programme Mob Wives filed suit against Rockstar Games in February 2014 in allegation that a character in the game is based on her likeness and story and was depicted without her consent. Rockstar filed to dismiss Gravano's lawsuit in April, and stated that the allegations are foreclosed by the First Amendment. In July, actress Lindsay Lohan also filed a lawsuit, claiming elements in the game, including the Lacey Jonas character, were influenced by her image, voice and clothing line without permission. Rockstar responded in court papers that sought a <b>dismissal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case, saying that the case was frivolous and filed for publicity purposes. In 2016, both lawsuits were dismissed.|$|E
5|$|Matthew Grant Webster, an 18-year-old {{who acted}} as a bouncer at the event, pleaded guilty to her murder {{and was sentenced to}} 20 years in prison with a 14-year non-parole period. He was {{released}} on parole in June 2004, after serving 14½ years. Guy Charles Wilson, the other bouncer and only other person aged over 18 at the party, pleaded guilty to assault; a third male (aged 15) pleaded guilty to having sex with a minor. The investigation of Leigh's murder proved controversial, however, as several people who admitted to various crimes, including assaulting Leigh, were never charged; nor was anyone ever charged with her sexual assault. Webster's confession did not match the forensic evidence. The murder investigation was reviewed by the New South Wales Crime Commission in 1996, and by the Police Integrity Commission in 1998, with the latter recommending the <b>dismissal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> detective in charge of the investigation.|$|E
5|$|On November 9, 2000, the WWF filed {{a lawsuit}} against the PTC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, {{claiming}} that the PTC's statements were false and constituted defamation. The WWF also filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the PTC for using clips from WWF programs in their promotional videos. The PTC filed for <b>dismissal</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> suit, but on May 24, 2001, U.S. district court Judge Denny Chin denied the PTC's motion on the basis that the WWF's lawsuit had merit. The PTC and the WWF settled out of court and, as part of the settlement agreement, the PTC paid the WWF $3.5 million USD and Bozell issued a public apology, stating that it was wrong to blame the World Wrestling Federation or any of its programs for the deaths of children and that the original statements had been based on what was later found to be false information designed by people close to the Lionel Tate case to blame the death of Tiffany Eunick on the WWF.|$|E
