5|$|Although he {{is known}} by many attributes, Ganesha's {{elephant}} head makes him <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify.</b> Ganesha is widely revered as the remover of obstacles, the patron of arts and sciences and the deva of intellect and wisdom. As the god of beginnings, he is honoured {{at the start of}} rites and ceremonies. Ganesha is also invoked as patron of letters and learning during writing sessions. Several texts relate mythological anecdotes associated with his birth and exploits and explain his distinct iconography.|$|E

5|$|Sydenham Hill {{is one of}} {{the highest}} {{locations}} in London; 109metres (357ft) above sea level (spot height on Ordnance Survey Map); {{and the size of the}} Palace and prominence of the site made it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> from much of London. This led to the residential area around the building becoming known as Crystal Palace instead of Sydenham Hill. The Palace was destroyed by fire on 30 November 1936 and the site of the building and its grounds is now known as Crystal Palace Park.|$|E
5|$|De Materia Medica is {{the prime}} {{historical}} {{source of information about}} the medicines used by the Greeks, Romans, and other cultures of antiquity. The work also records the Dacian names for some plants, which otherwise would have been lost. The work presents about 600 plants in all, along with some animals and mineral substances, and around 1000 medicines made from these sources. Botanists have not always found Dioscorides' plants <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> from his short descriptions, partly because he had naturally described plants and animals from southeastern Europe, whereas by the sixteenth century his book was in use all over Europe and across the Islamic world. This meant that people attempted to force a match between the plants they knew and those described by Dioscorides, leading to what could be catastrophic results.|$|E
5|$|Males are <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> due {{to their}} perceptibly broad and smaller mandibles. Their {{antennae}} consist of 13 segments, and are almost the same length as the ants' bodies. Ergatandromorph (an ant that exhibits both male and worker characteristics) males are known; in 1985, a male M. gulosa was collected before it hatched from its cocoon, {{and it had a}} long but excessively curved left mandible while the other mandible was small. On the right side of its body, it was structurally male, but the left side appeared female. The head was also longer on the female side, its colour was darker, and the legs and prothorax were smaller on the male side. Male genitalia are retracted into a genital cavity that is located in the posterior end of the gaster. The sperm is structurally the same to other animal sperm, forming an oval head with a long tail.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Jovovich {{starred in}} the horror/action film Resident Evil, {{released}} in the United States on March 15, 2002 {{and based on the}} CAPCOM video game series of the same name. She portrayed Alice, the film's heroine, who fights a legion of zombies created by the Umbrella Corporation. Jovovich had accepted the role because she and her brother Marco had been fans of the video game franchise. Jovovich had performed all the stunts required in the film, except for a scene that would involve her jumping to a cement platform, which her management deemed too dangerous, and had trained in karate, kickboxing, and combat-training. The film was commercially successful, grossing $17 million on its opening weekend, and gaining $40 million domestically and $102 million worldwide. Later, she portrayed the manipulative gang wife Erin in No Good Deed (2002), Nadine in the romantic comedy You Stupid Man (2002), punk rocker Fangora ("Fanny") in Dummy (2003), and provided a guest voice on the television series King of the Hill. The role of Fangora in Dummy allowed Jovovich to act in film with Oscar-winning Adrien Brody, who was a friend prior to filming. Jovovich found it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> with this role because she felt Fangora possessed similar qualities to the actress' own life.|$|E

25|$|Pesticide losses may be {{relatively}} <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> (large and sudden numbers of dead bees {{in front of}} the hive) or quite difficult, especially if the loss results from a gradual accumulation of pesticide brought in by the foraging bees. Quick-acting pesticides may deprive the hive of its foragers, dropping them in the field before they can return home.|$|E
25|$|Professional divers are {{screened}} for risk factors during initial and periodical medical examination for fitness to dive. In most cases recreational divers are not medically screened, but {{are required to}} provide a medical statement before acceptance for training in which {{the most common and}} <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> risk factors must be declared. If these factors are declared, the diver may be required to be examined by a medical practitioner, and may be disqualified from diving if the conditions indicate.|$|E

25|$|The {{t-distribution}} {{is often}} used {{as an alternative to}} the normal distribution as a model for data, which often has heavier tails than the normal distribution allows for; see e.g. Lange et al. The classical approach was to identify outliers and exclude or downweight them in some way. However, it is not always <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> outliers (especially in high dimensions), and the t-distribution is a natural choice of model for such data and provides a parametric approach to robust statistics.|$|E
25|$|Behavioral and {{ecological}} separation of tinamou species is evident where their ranges overlap through {{the utilization of}} different food sources and occupation of limited micro-habitats. These micro-habitats are not always <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify,</b> and are highly vulnerable to environmental changes. Some species, such as the red-winged tinamou, utilize multiple habitats such as the open savannas of Amazonia and the dry valleys of the Andes. Similarly, brown tinamous occur in both the Amazon basin and the humid montane forests on the Andean slope.|$|E
25|$|Jewel spiders have a {{distinctive}} appearance {{that makes them}} relatively <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify.</b> The cephalothorax is black in colour with a bluish metallic sheen. It is covered with small white hairs (setae). The carapace (upper part of the cephalothorax) is rectangular in shape. The sternum (chest) is brownish black, with a yellow central area. The chelicerae (fangs) are black with four to six small teeth. The maxillae and other mouthparts are black at the base, lightening to brown and bright yellow at the tips. The pedipalps are dark brown.|$|E

25|$|In astronomy, an {{asterism}} is any {{pattern of}} stars {{recognized in the}} Earth's night sky. It {{may be part of}} an official constellation or it may be composed of stars from more than one constellation. Asterisms are composed of stars which, although visible in the same general area of the sky as viewed from Earth, are located at very different distances from Earth, at great distances from each other. Many asterisms are simple shapes composed of a few bright stars, making them <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify,</b> and particularly useful to people who are familiarizing themselves with the night sky.|$|E
25|$|Die {{deterioration}} doubling is {{a result}} of a few simple causes, but {{it can be difficult to}} positively identify. There are a number of different features which appear similar, but the characteristic traits of each are <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify</b> with practice. Die deterioration doubling is often mistaken for hub doubling. The causes of the two types of doubling are different, but their appearance on the finished coin is often similar. Die deterioration doubling appears most often around the mintmark and date because they are alone in the field. When it occurs in other features, like an image of a bust, it looks more like a weak strike than doubling.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the process}} of {{clinical}} diagnosis begins and myiasis is recognised, the larvae are fairly <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>identify.</b> Their overall body structure resembles the spiraled screw shape on which their common name is based, a shape fairly unusual within parasitic larvae. The cranial end of the larvae has two sharply curved hooks, generally dark in color, and distinctive spiracle patterns are observed at the caudal end. The most identifying features, and {{the easiest way to}} differentiate between C. hominivorax and C. macellaria, are the prominent darkened tracheal tubes which are visible in the final third of the larval body of the former, and are often visible both with a microscope and to the naked eye.|$|E
