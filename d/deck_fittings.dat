2500|$|On 4 December 1912, Lady Elizabeth left Vancouver {{bound for}} Delagoa Bay Mozambique, with a {{shipment}} of lumber. The ship encountered severe weather halfway through the voyage and was damaged just off Cape Horn. Four crew members were lost overboard, along with the ship's two boats and part of her deck cargo. She also sustained damage to the <b>deck</b> <b>fittings,</b> wheel, moorings, {{and other parts of}} the ship. Captain Hoigh ordered the ship to the nearest port for repairs.

60|$|After {{watching}} {{it for some}} minutes he ordered the stays and runners to be cut, {{at the same time}} calling all hands aft. Scarcely had the men gathered there than the vessel plunged her head into the sea. There was a loud report, and the top-gallant mast fell over her bows with a crash. Two of the Chilians with axes crawled out along the bowsprit and cut away the gear that held the spar alongside, and the wreckage at once floated away. The jib-boom was then got in, and the vessel felt the relief and lifted her head more buoyantly over the seas. For four days the gale continued, her bulwarks were carried away, and the waves swept her decks continually. One tremendous roller carried away the boats, the caboose, and all the <b>deck</b> <b>fittings,</b> together with four of the Chilians and six of the Peruvian sailors. The straining had opened her seams, and although the pumps had been kept going as long as the crew had been able to work at them, the water had been gaining steadily, and even the Chilians, who had kept on doggedly long after the Peruvians had thrown themselves down exhausted and hopeless, now ceased what was evidently a useless labour.|$|E

50|$|The mast, which lacks shroud and bar, is hollow {{case and}} {{consists}} of glued wood with a hoisted (a planed or machined grooved) luff. The relatively coarse mast is supported by simple ball bearings at <b>deck</b> <b>fitting</b> and in the bottom. The sails are hoisted and hauled usually only once, in spring and autumn. During the season the sail(s) are wound up on the mast by this rotated by a crank in the cockpit which drives an endless rope on a collar attached to {{the lower part of}} the mast. Reefing is therefore simple. By rotating the mast slightly a better aerodynamic profile which avoids turbulence on the leeward side of the circular mast is created. At full run the two sails are hauled on each side so the sail area doubled.|$|R

50|$|The {{main purpose}} of the upper or primary deck is structural, and only {{secondarily}} to provide weather-tightness and support people and equipment. The deck serves as the lid to the complex box girder which is the hull. It resists tension, compression, and racking forces. The deck's scantling is usually {{the same as the}} topsides, or might be heavier if the deck is expected to carry heavier loads (for example a container ship). The deck will be reinforced around <b>deck</b> <b>fittings</b> such as the capstan, cleats, or bollards.|$|E
50|$|INS Kochi is {{the largest}} India-made warship, till {{the time of its}} commissioning. The warship is {{designed}} by the Navy's in-house organisation, directorate of naval design, and it is constructed by Mazagon Dock Ship builders Ltd in Mumbai. It has displacement of 7,500 tons and it is 164 m in length and 17 m at the beam and is propelled by four gas turbines and designed to achieve speeds in excess of 30 kn. The ship has built with advanced stealth features which have been achieved through shaping of hull and use of radar-transparent <b>deck</b> <b>fittings.</b> A bow mounted sonar dome, the second of its kind in an indigenous naval platform, has been introduced to enhance sonar acoustic performance.The ship has a complement of about 40 officers and 350 sailors.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} {{assigned}} to the Channel Fleet upon commissioning in 1865. Scorpion was refitted in 1867 with a flying bridge that connected the forecastle to the poop, above the tops of the turrets, and her sailing rig was reduced to a fore-and-aft rig. The ship recommissioned in 1868 for another tour with the Channel Fleet. She arrived in Bermuda in November 1869 where she became the local guard ship. In 1873 a proposal was made to remove her poop and forecastle, masts and <b>deck</b> <b>fitting</b> to convert her to a harbour defence monitor with all-around fire, but this was deemed too expensive and the project was abandoned in 1878. At some point during her service in Bermuda her rigging was removed and she was reduced to simple pole masts. The ship was fitted with searchlights and quick-firing guns in 1890. Scorpion was sunk as a target in 1901; she was raised in 1902 and sold in February 1903 for Â£736. She sank while under tow to Boston, Massachusetts.|$|R
5000|$|Since ships {{would be}} {{required}} to fight [...] "end-on" [...] when attempting to ram (or to rush into a pell-mell battle), many ships were designed to give as much fire ahead (and sometimes astern) as on the broadside. This was usually at the expense of seaworthiness, and in many cases firing directly ahead caused blast damage to superstructure, <b>decks</b> and <b>fittings.</b> This was another factor which made ramming invalid as a tactic.|$|R
5000|$|Chester {{was built}} by Edward Withy and Company in their Middleton Yard at Hartlepool and {{launched}} on 29 April 1884, sponsored by Miss Florence Withy. She was designed for the passenger and cargo service between Grimsby, England, and Hamburg, Germany. She had a long poop deck, a long bridge house, and a long topgallant forecastle. The bridge house was fitted up for the accommodation of thirty first-class passengers (including ladiesâ cabin), the captain, and so on. There was accommodation in the forecastle for second-class passengers, and in the poop aft for officers and crew. In the âtween <b>decks</b> were <b>fittings</b> for 100 emigrants.|$|R
5000|$|There was {{a longstanding}} rumour that the ships could not fire a full {{broadside}} without risk of structural damage. This was disproved during the {{action against the}} German battleship , where Rodney was able to fire upwards of 40 broadsides (380 shells) without major structural damage except to deck planking and upper <b>deck</b> <b>fittings,</b> although damage to sickbay fittings, partition bulkheads, toilet bowls and plumbing in the forecastle was extensive. Virtually every light bulb in the forward section was shattered also. [...] Despite the derisive criticism directed at this class of battleship {{by some of the}} media and some sailors upon their debut, naval historian Antony Preston considered that [...] "they were soundly conceived ships reflecting all the hard-won experience of World War One" [...] and that [...] "they proved to be very well-protected and well-designed ships".|$|E

50|$|Vickers Shipbuilders at Barrow-in-Furness were {{approached}} {{and asked to}} make their own survey to see what could be done. They reported that a new hull would be needed and that the superstructure would have to be replaced entirely. Furthermore, if she were to be steam powered once again, a suitable engine and boiler would have to be sourced. The original wrought iron gunwale plate - the curved edge of the ship where the deck meets the hull - was salvageable, however, and could form part of the new hull. Some of the barley-twist wrought iron handrails and railings were reusable, along with many of the bronze and brass <b>deck</b> <b>fittings.</b> Vickers were invited to proceed with work and further funds were raised from the same sources as before. The famous yard readily undertook the project. To get the original hull to Barrow, it was cut into three sections, which then had to be reassembled before work on the new hull could begin, using the lines of the original boat.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1914, {{the ship}} was requisitioned for {{military}} service. Berrima was taken to Cockatoo Island Dockyard on 12 August for refitting, but instead of being converted into a troop transport as originally planned, the ship underwent a six-day conversion for naval service. The modifications included converting holds into accommodation for 1,500 officers and soldiers, establishing a hospital was on the upper <b>deck,</b> and <b>fitting</b> four [...] BL naval guns and magazines, two on the forecastle, two on the poop deck. On 17 August, {{the ship was}} commissioned as the auxiliary cruiser HMAS Berrima, {{under the command of}} Commander J.B. Stevenson. The ship's civilian officer complement were inducted into the Royal Australian Naval Reserve, and the crew was supplemented by Royal Navy and RAN sailors.|$|R
2500|$|One major design {{difference}} between the Royal Navy Buckley-class frigates and the US Navy Buckley-class destroyer escorts was that the Royal Navy frigates did not mount torpedo tubes. (The Evarts-class was not designed to carry torpedoes.) [...] The resulting reduction in top weight combined with the previous reduction in the gun battery resulted in excessive stability, causing sharp and violent rolling behavior in the relatively short North Atlantic swells. [...] Several solutions were discussed including reshipping the torpedo tubes and replacing the American 3"/50 caliber guns with heavier British 4.5 inch but all proved impractical due to production bottlenecks and wartime congestion in British shipyards. [...] The problem was ultimately addressed by {{increasing the number of}} depth charges stowed on the upper <b>deck</b> and <b>fitting</b> larger bilge keels, which tamed the roll to manageable levels.|$|R
50|$|In 1900 the Naval and the Torpedo Corps were {{merged with}} the Garrison Artillery. The torpedo boat, by then {{thoroughly}} outmoded, was neglected and not replaced. When the Government later offered the vessel for sale it was bought for almost nothing by Mr Mark Thomas, a well-known Lyttelton steam launch proprietor. He removed many parts and dumped the hull on the Purau Beach. Her engines {{were given to the}} School of Engineering at Canterbury University. For many years the rusty remains of Defender lay on the beach at Purau Bay. The conning tower was eventually used in a nearby paddock as a watering trough, the steel plating, funnels, and <b>deck</b> <b>fittings</b> long since removed. Her ignominious end was the result of neglect and misuse from the time of her arrival at Lyttelton. In 1909 the Mt. Herbert County Council used a traction engine to pull the hull further up the shore but the whole thing broke in two during this operation. The rusty remains littered the beach until well after the Second World War. The local Borough Council eventually bulldozed what was left into a pit.|$|E
50|$|Retired {{aeronautical}} engineer Don Jordan tested {{what is now}} known as the series drogue, originally conceived and patented by E.J. Pagan and later patented by Sidelnikov in 1975; however, before his tests, numerous mariners had experimented with pulling several large drogues in series. Like Sidelnikov, Jordan expanded upon this idea, and affixed a large number of small parachute drogues to a nylon rope with a weight at the end. The large number of smaller drogues results in there always being a drag force on the line; it {{does not have to be}} adjusted to be in phase with the waves as the drag is spread out over many waves. Because the drogue line is prevented from becoming slack there is no jerking or snapping of high loads on the line. This prevention reduces damage to <b>deck</b> <b>fittings</b> and reduces the chance of breakage. The number of small parachutes, the length and thickness of the line, and the size of the end weight are all matched to the displacement of the boat. Another key design feature is the V-bridle. The two attachments should be made at the outer corners of the transom with the lengths of the two bridle lines being 2.5 times the width between the attachment points. According to Jordon, special reinforcement is required for the bridle attachment since Jordon projects that forces of 7,000 lb. to 27,000 lb. and even higher can occur with a breaking wave strike. With this deployment no steering of any kind is needed.|$|E
5000|$|Egremont {{differed}} externally to Leasowe in {{that she}} had a canvas awning fitted around her funnel. Early photographs of Leasowe and Egremont show them carrying what look like binnacle shrouds (the brass lids that sit atop of a binnacle) on the roof of their wheelhouses and wing cabs. It is not understood what these were. Some people have said that they were in fact ventilation devices. Upon the bridge there were numerous modern devices. Chadburn synchrostep telegraphs and rudder angle indicators, hydraulic steering telemotor and an automatic whistle control could be found in both the wheelhouse and the navigation boxes. There was also an internal communication system, a ship to shore radio and PA system and three binnacles on the bridge. Similar types of navigation equipment and <b>deck</b> <b>fittings</b> used on these vessels are extant on the Edmund Gardner Pilot Boat at Merseyside Maritime Museum. The Leasowe and Egremont were popular ferries with their crews as they had much improved crew accommodation compared to the earlier steamers, where much of the lower deck space was taken up with boilers and machinery. When the ferries entered service they all had Wallasey white and black funnel liveries. There was, however, a major design fault with Leasowe and Egremont. In order to reach the bows of the ship when casting off etc., crew members were required to either push through the hordes of commuters and climb down a ladder from the forward promenade deck or walk along the rubbing strake and climb over. In flat calm conditions this was not a problem, but in a force 8 gale with the vessel bobbing around wildly, it could be considerably dangerous. The simple reason for such problems was because there was no door leading from the main saloon to the bow area of the ships! ...|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of tinplate {{and improvements in}} machine tools enabled significant advances in ship modelling from 1900 onwards. Thin, workable sheets of iron could be coated with tin to prevent rusting, then mass-produced as parts of ship model kits. The process was pioneered by French ship model manufacturer Radiguet, which produced a line of zinc boats with pressurised steam engines, wooden <b>decking</b> and brass <b>fittings.</b> The speed of production for tinplate vessels enabled one 1909 manufacturer to produce ship models of speedboats that had competed that year in Monaco.|$|R
60|$|They {{laid the}} body on <b>deck,</b> and, after <b>fitting</b> the canvas to it, seated themselves, cross-legged like tailors, {{one on each}} side, and, with their {{lanterns}} before them, went to stitching away, as if mending an old sail. Both were old men, with grizzled hair and beard, and shrunken faces. They belonged to that small class of aged seamen who, for their previous long and faithful services, are retained in the Navy more as pensioners upon its merited bounty than anything else. They are set to light and easy duties.|$|R
