40|$|The {{problem in}} {{supplying}} iodine to {{people suffering from}} iodine deficiency disorders are technique to produce iodated salt and the great distance between producers and consumers. The delivery of iodine {{would be more effective}} if production of iodated salt is carried out near or in areas of iodine deficiency disorders. Nutrition Research and Development Centre, Ministry of Health, RI has produced a small-scale salt <b>iodation</b> plant. The plant has been tested in the laboratory. Field trial of the plant was carried out in collaboration with the Village Cooperatives Unit (Koperasi Unit Desa) at Bulu Cindeo, District of Pangkajene and Kepulauan, South Sulawesi. Locally-produced salt was iodated. The product was distributed not only in Pangkep but in neighbouring districts as well. It was observed that the small scale <b>iodation</b> plant was an appropriate technology for village level. It could be operated by man powers having minimum education (primary school). The production unit needs a not-too-big investment to run the plant During the trial, the Cooperatives learned that the plant was efficient and was economically profitable. The availability of iodated salt in the area, resulted in increased consumption. Keywords: salt <b>iodation,</b> <b>iodation</b> machine. </p...|$|E

40|$|Background: Iodine {{deficiency}} disorders (IDD) is a {{major public}} health problem worldwide, {{in which more than}} two billion people have insufficient iodine intake, including 285 million school-age children. In Tanzania, 41 % of the population is at risk of IDD and 30 % of perinatal mortality is estimated to be attributable to iodine deficiency. Iodine deficiency is the number one cause of preventable brain damage in children and an important cause of infant deaths. The most cost-effective health intervention to correct IDD is universal salt <b>iodation</b> (USI). Tanzania has adopted USI since the early 1990 s, but not much is known about its impact on the population and the challenges that were met in implementing this programme in the developing world. Objective: The iodine status of the population following iodine supplementation and salt fortification interventions, and performance of salt <b>iodation</b> technologies used to optimise intervention strategies for sustainable elimination of IDD in Tanzania, have been investigated. Methods: Three cross-sectional surveys were carried out in: a) the most iodine deficient areas in 1999; b) low priority intervening areas of Zanzibar islands in 2001; c) a national survey in mainland Tanzania in 2004. These involved testing of salt consumed in the households, analysis of urinary iodine, and goitre assessment in > 160 000 school-age children, and d) another survey in mainland Tanzania, which investigated the status of the salt <b>iodation</b> machines {{and the quality of the}} product at salt factories. An experimental study was also carried out to improve the local technologies for salt <b>iodation.</b> Results: In the most IDD affected areas in Tanzania, total goitre prevalence (TGP) dropped from 65 % in 1980 s to 24 % in 1999, with 83 % of households consuming iodated salt. In Zanzibar islands where there was no intervention, TGP was 25. 6 %. Pemba Island had a higher TGP of 32 % with almost no iodated salt consumed in the households. In mainland Tanzania, a marked improvement was observed in the national survey with a drop of 25 % in TGP in school-age children in 1980 s to 6. 9 % in 2004, and currently 94. 5 % of school children aged 6 - 12 years have no goitre countrywide. However, excessive iodine intake (> 300 μg/l) was found in 35 % of the urine samples, raising concern as to the effectiveness of quality control at the salt production factories. Interviews with salt workers indicated that the standard <b>iodation</b> machines previously serving 140 salt works had been abandoned due to high running costs. Instead, simple <b>iodation</b> techniques using sprayers and sprinklers had been adapted to iodinate the salt. However, 24 % and 69 % of the salt samples analysed from these local technologies were over-iodinated or under-iodinated. The local technologies needed to be evaluated if they were to sustain USI. Improved local <b>iodation</b> methods and procedures, achieved homogenous iodine concentrations with 96 % of the salt samples falling within the recommended iodine level of 40 - 80 ppm. Discussion: It has been demonstrated that a huge improvement in iodine status of large Tanzanian population has resulted from the USI. This might have prevented thousands of child deaths in the country and spared millions of school children from substandard IQ levels, which were both the correct policies. USI has to be extended to cover the Islands of Zanzibar. Locally adopted salt <b>iodation</b> methods with low running costs need to be introduced and maintained in for sustainable IDD elimination. Efforts to enforce salt law and monitor the production and sales of iodated salt have to be stepped up throughout the country for each household to benefit from this cost-effective intervention...|$|E

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of this Thesis, a method fot the preparation of 3, 6 - disubstituted pyranones was developed and 15 final lactones were synthesized, and their cytostatic and antifungal activity was investigated.

40|$|Endemic goitre due {{mainly to}} iodine {{deficiency}} {{has been recorded}} {{in many areas of}} the world throughout history and its response to crude iodine preparations has been noted. The good effect of the pure element in the treatment of goitre was modified by severe thyrotoxic reactions, reported particularly from areas of endemic goitre. A rational basis for the use of iodine in prophylaxis against goitre, came with the discoveries linking iodine with thyroid metabolism and measurements of low iodine concentrations in water, soil and plants. Mountainous areas which are far from the sea and have been subjected to glaciation in the last Ice Age are particularly prone to iodine deficiency. The excellent response to iodine prophylaxis in preventing goitre in the children of Ohio, U. S. A. was followed by an equally good one in Switzerland. However there were further reports of thyrotoxicosis following iodine prophylaxis again occurring in adult goitrous females. It was thought by those who believed that iodine caused thyrotoxicosis in some people, that the size of' thedose given was important but examples suggest that this was not so. Indeed many authorities denied the existence of iodbasedow. Tasmania has been a very satisfactory area to observe these phenomena. Population shifts are minimal and it was a moderately iodine deficient island with a goitre incidence among adult females of approximately 30 per cent. Although goitregens were pro- posed as a contributing cause of goitre none such have been found. <b>Iodation</b> of bread gave universal prophylaxis to the population and an excellent response has been achieved. Goitre prevalence in children has fallen to that seen in countries where goitre is not endemic. The pathology of goitre in Tasmania is similar to that seen in all parts of the world. There does not seem to be any increased incidence of thyroid cancer, cretinism is rare and before <b>iodation</b> of bread the incidence of thyrotoxicosis was lower than that recorded in iodine sufficient communities. Several factors have combined to produce a change in iodine content in the environment of Tasmania, before <b>iodation</b> of bread. The importation of large amounts of food from areas of Australia which are not iodine deficient and the use of iodophors in the food industry provided extra iodine. Several other sources of iodine were brought to Tasmania resulting in a gradual increase in iodine consumption. A steady increase in the incidence of thyrotoxicosis was noticed from 1960, as shown in Fig. 10 - 2 with a sudden rise which has continued from 1966 when bread was iodated. It is suggested that the incidence of thyrotoxicosis has risen to that occurring in nonendemic goitre areas, previous iodine deficiency having protected those otherwise prone to develope the disease. If this is so, the incidence will remain similar to that of the average world incidence for non-endemic goitre areas, but the age group affected should become progressively younger. The addition of iodine to the diet of the population of Tasmania can be justified by the disappearance of goitre and consequent decrease in thyrocardiac disease which is associated with nodular goitre in middle age, the probable disappearance of. lethal cancer of the thyroid in the elderly, tracheal obstruction by retrosternal goitre and the cosmetic effect in females who formed the majority affected by the condition. It is predicted that the price for this will be a slight increase in the incidence of thyrotoxicosis in an age group which will become progressively younger and more able to cope with the disease. On balance at the present time this price is reasonable. Evidence to support these assumptions are presented in the body of the thesis...|$|E
40|$|East salt sparingly- sprinkle, don't shake! The salt-blood {{pressure}} hypothesis {{states that}} an excessive salt intake {{leads to an}} increase in blood pressure in genetically susceptible persons and, if high intake is maintained long term, ultimately leads to sustained hypertension. It is estimated that about 3. 3 million South Africans (12. 6 % and 16. 3 % of adult men and women, respectively) are hypertensive. However, not all subjects within a particular population respond equally to exposure to high-salt diets. Methods to identify those who are 'salt sensitive ' remain in the research domain; therefore a population approach to the restriction of dietary salt intake is warranted. The message to 'eat salt sparingly ' will not interfere with the current nutritional and legal requirements regarding <b>iodation</b> of table salt.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} focused on the specifics of the nursing care of patients with hypothyroidism. Hypothyroidism is a disease of the thyroid gland, which is characterized by its reduced function, and its consequence is an insufficient supply of the thyroid hormones to the human body. The most common cause tends to be of the autoimmune nature which is when an organism creates antidotes against its structure thyroid. Here arises chronic inflammation which violates the gland. Thyroid disorder can also arise because of long term iodine deficiency. But it doesn't occur in our society due to the <b>iodation</b> of salt in the fifties of the last century. Hypothyroidism caused by the lack of iodine {{can be found in the}} mountainous areas of third world countries where there is low iodine content in the soil. Literature talks about the growing incidence of disease amongst the population, it can be misinterpreted by many factors such as the aging population, growth of autoimmune diseases, diagnostic procedures improvement and by the targeted search for disease. In our population postnatal hypothyroidism is more common. Its incidence grows with age and affects mainly women, men are affected considerably less. High-risk groups of population are pregnant and breastfeeding women, and also children and adolescents. The only source of iodine for the fetus during intrauterine development, newborns, and infants is their mother. The Mother's lack of iodine can cause serious malfunction in the child's brain development. Congenital disorders of thyroid gland are rare nowadays. There is no doubt that improving and increasing demands on nursing care are closely related to these facts...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a regional position on Universal Salt <b>Iodation</b> (USI) intervention in 14 countries ill the East, Central and Southern Africa(ECSA) region,namely;Botswana,Kenya,Malawi,Mauritius,Mozambique,Namibia,bells,South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe The is {{a follow-up to}} a resolution {{on the need to}} develop a regional position on USI intervention which was made at the Commonwealth Regional Health Community 25 th Health Ministers Conference in Port Louis, Mauritius from November; 29, 1996. The overall objective was to get views on the implementation of USI intervention in order to identify areas requiring facilitation, harmonization, coordination and collaboration at nation and regional levels in the ECSA. The preparation of paper involved reviewing of USI legislation regulations plans of action, survey reports and workshop papers. To substantiate the literature review, individual interviews were held with USI stakeholders in Malawi, Namibia, Tanzania, Zambia, and Zimbabwe from July 10 - 21, 1997 In respect of the findings, all the CRHC mainland member states are implementing USI intervention as a long term strategy for virtual elimination of the year 2000. The evaluation results of some of the national programmes have shown improvement of indicators of adequacy of iodine in the body. For example there is crease in levels of urinary iodine and reduction of goiter in countries where the intervention has been implemented actively over the past few years. In order to enforce the marketing of iodated salt, {{more than half of the}} CRHC member states have legislated USI where those who have not passed legislation yet are promoting USI through extensive advocacy and marketing strategy. These national USI programmes are being augmented by technical, financial and material support from United Nations and multilateral agencies, and the cooperation and compliance of the salt industry in iodating and packaging salt in line with USI legislation of country in the ECSA region. There are obstacles and constraints that impinge on the progress of USI in the entire ECSA region: The national USI legislation and regulations are not harmonized. The role of other sub-sector such as agriculture, trade and industry, and issues related to quality assurance are not spelt out in the regulations. There is still disparity in level of awareness of USI and its importance at all levels. Except Malawi, the rest of CRHC member states have no USI legislation for all salt intended for animal consumption. This is threatening sustenance of USI as there some leakages of uniodated salt from livestock sub-sector to people. Further threat emerges from communities who produce uniodated salt on a small scale for their own consumption and sale in their localities. The export and import duty for iodated and uniodate salt are the same. This does not deter traders and consumers to market and use uniodated salt because its price is either low or similar to the price of iodated salt. The challenge is, therefore, how to place the USI high on the agenda of relevant national and ECSA regional sub-sectors which formulate, implement and coordinate policy in order to strengthen and harmonize the intervention as well as deploying regionally acceptable measures to overcome the constraints. The CRHC should facilitate the harmonization of the USI regulations in the ECSA region including the reduction of the present high iodine levels to the levels (20 - 40 ppm iodine[30 - 66 ppm Potassium iodate]) that are recommended by the WHO. The CRHC should ensure that quality assurance issues are made mandatory in order to promote quality of salt iodations during production and packaging. The CRHC should facilitate development of guidelines regarding the roles of all sub-sectors such as ministries of Agriculture, Health and Trade and Industry, Departments of customs (Revenue Collection Authorities) and Bureaus of Standards in the USI which should issued under the directive of the Southern Africa Development Community and Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa trade agreement. The CRHC should facilitate and support promotion of USI through regional networking,development and production of information, education and communication(IEC) material, designation of a regional IDD/USI day establishment of IIDD newsletter. The CRHC should ensure that member states consider making uniodated salt for whatever use a controlled commodity and impose deterrent export and import duty in order to protect, support and promote use of iodated salt for human and animal consumption in the region. The CRHC should facilitate establishment of at least one regional micronutrients reference laboratory and improvement of the national laboratories. The CHRC should strengthen the Department of Food Security and Nutrition of personnel in order to enhance capacity to accomplish the suggested activities listed below along with other planned work in the Department.
