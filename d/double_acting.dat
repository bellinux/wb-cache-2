25|$|The first <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> icebreaking vessel, Azipod-equipped river {{icebreaker}} Röthelstein, {{was delivered}} in 1995. The vessel {{was designed to}} break apart ice ridges deeper than the vessel's draft when moving astern.

Other early <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> concepts included a similar ship with an icebreaking bow that would be utilized in summer time when the ship was traveling in areas with low ice concentration but with a risk of colliding with multi-year ice blocks.|$|E

25|$|The first Watt engines were {{atmospheric}} pressure engines, like the Newcomen engine {{but with the}} condensation taking place separate from the cylinder. Driving the engines using both low pressure steam and a partial vacuum {{raised the possibility of}} reciprocating engine development. An arrangement of valves could alternately admit low pressure steam to the cylinder and then connect with the condenser.

25|$|Model tests {{conducted}} by MARC in 1994 {{showed that a}} <b>double</b> <b>acting</b> ship equipped with an Azipod propulsion unit could break through ice ridges in continuous motion instead of ramming like conventional icebreakers.

The icebreaking capability of an Azipod-equipped icebreaker operating astern in level ice was also found out to be superior to traditional icebreakers regardless of propulsion arrangement.|$|E
