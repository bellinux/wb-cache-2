Herein, we propose a novel, low-cost and convenient detection technique, referred to as a single-line-scan power spectrum analysis (SPSA), which is established based on the power spectrum analysis of <b>friction</b> <b>information</b> that is extracted from an atomic-resolution lateral friction microscopy image. By analysing the characteristics of the <b>friction</b> <b>information</b> and the corresponding frequency spectrum obtained from the tribological surface of MoS 2, we innovatively establish a relationship between the frequency characteristics and lattice orientation and ultimately propose our SPSA, which enables detection of the direct lattice orientation using the frequency characteristic values of an arbitrary line on an atomic image. The experimental results further verify the effectiveness and convenience of the SPSA process...|$|E

In this paper, we present an adaptive trajectory control design for a skid-steered wheeled mobile robot. Kinematic and dynamic modeling of the robot is first presented. A pseudo-static friction model is used to capture the interaction between the wheels and the ground. An adaptive control algorithm is designed to simultaneously estimate the wheel/ground contact <b>friction</b> <b>information</b> and control the mobile robot to follow a desired trajectory. A Lyapunovbased convergence analysis of the controller and the estimation of the friction model parameter is presented.

Experiments were first conducted in order to find a suitable representation for friction in the system. We then looked at two observers reported in the literature (known as Friedland Mentzelopoulou and Tafazoli) for simultaneous on-line estimation of friction and velocity. Additionally, we developed a new variablestructure observer for the same purpose. In order to compare results, a model-based friction compensator using acceleration feedback control has been used. The best tracking performance has been achieved using the identified friction model, at the expense of considerable time spent with the experimental identification. Friction estimation using nonlinear observers are a viable alternative as far as model-based friction compensation is concerned, but a loss of accuracy occurs. ...|$|E

It is not easy to estimate the tire/road friction forces and coefficient accurately because of the nonlinear system, parameters uncertainties, and signal noises.

The tire forces were observed by the discrete Kalman filter, and the road friction coefficient was estimated by the recursive least square method consequently. Then, the proposed algorithm was analysed and verified by simulation and road test. A sliding mode based ABS with smooth wheel slip ratio control and a threshold based ABS by pulse pressure control with significant fluctuations were used for the simulation. Finally, road tests were carried out in both winter and summer by the car equipped with the same threshold based ABS, and the algorithm was evaluated on different road surfaces.

The estimator structure is shown to be robust to road conditions and rejects disturbances and model uncertainties effectively.

40|$|Real-time {{information}} about the current tyre-road friction coefficient is important for vehicles with increasing levels of automation to adapt intervention thresholds and vehicle velocity. Online friction estimation poses large challenges in terms of availability and accuracy of the estimate. When estimating the friction based on the slip and force of a tyre, {{the accuracy of the}} estimate depends on the current tyre friction utilisation. This paper presents a method to evaluate how large tyre force excitation that is required to estimate the current friction level within a given error using an effectbased approach. The results indicate that large variations in the required utilisation should be expected for different tyre and road surface combinations when tyre models that only have the slip stiffness and the friction coefficient as parameters (e. g. brush tyre model) are used in the observer to estimate the friction coefficient. For the brush tyre model it varied from 54 % in the best case to 94 % in the worst case. To illustrate the benefit of quantification of required utilisation an example use of an estimator based on the brush tyre model is shown in the end of this paper. A simulation is performed to show how fast a sudden drop in friction during braking can be detected using a recursive online estimator. The results show that the estimator is able to detect the change in friction and converge to the new friction level in 0. 06 s, which is fast enough to potentially improve the performance of ABS systems of trucks. Tyre models for online friction estimation must hence be chosen with the intended use in mind.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} many important issues associate with pavement surface friction testing, in particular using the smooth tire. This study utilized 3 -D FEM program {{to investigate the}} fundamental friction phenomenon in light of energy dissipation during friction process. It was demonstrated that the pavement friction depends on many factors such as test tire, test speed, surrounding conditions, pavement surface texture, and pavement type. A great amount of friction data has been collected so as to investigate variations involved in pavement friction measurements. System variations depend on the feature of pavement surface. The standard deviations due to system errors are usually less than 5. The smooth tire tends to provide greater variations than the ribbed tire. As air temperature increases, the friction number does not necessarily decrease. No consistent relations were identified between friction measurements and test seasons. Seasonal friction variations are negligible. The largest directional variation is 16 with the smooth tire on a State road. The State and U. S. roads tend to produce greater directional variations than the interstates. Driving lane usually has lower friction than other lanes. The greatest lateral variation arose due {{to the effect of}} wheel track. Longitudinal friction variations depend on traffic distribution, pavement type, and surrounding conditions. Friction measurements taken at 1. 0 -mile spacing can provide realistic network pavement <b>friction</b> <b>information.</b> Pavement frictions on interstates decreased faster than those on State and US roads. INDOT conducts pavement inventory friction test every year on interstates and every three years on State and US roads. The force transducers should be calibrated every month and the whole system performance verified every week so as to identify potential significant performance changes. A minimum of three to five test runs must be conducted for system verification. The standard smooth tire is recommended for INDOT network pavement inventory friction test. In general, the friction number measured with the ribbed tire is greater than that with the smooth tire. However, the differences decrease as the surface texture becomes rougher. The average friction difference is about 20 on highway pavements. Friction test speed should be determined in light of the traffic conditions. Three test speeds of 30 mph, 40 mph, and 50 mph are recommended for network pavement inventory friction testing. Determination of the minimum friction requirement should consider its impact on wet-pavement accidents and agency’s budgets. Taking into account the minimum friction requirement recommended by NCHRP Report- 37 and the differences between the ribbed and smooth tires, a friction number of 20 with the smooth tire at 40 mph is recommended as the minimum friction requirement for network pavement inventory friction testing. It was found that this requirement is economically reasonable in light of the network pavement maintenance and resurfacing. No good correlations were identified between pavement friction and wet-pavement accidents...|$|E
40|$|Vehicles' {{active safety}} systems use {{different}} sensors, vehicle states, and actuators, along with an advanced control algorithm, to assist drivers and to maintain the dynamics of a vehicle within a desired safe range in case of instability in vehicle motion. Therefore, recent developments in such vehicle stability control and autonomous driving systems have led to substantial interest in reliable road angle and vehicle states (tire forces and vehicle velocities) estimation. Advances in applications of sensor technologies, sensor fusion, and cooperative estimation in intelligent transportation systems facilitate reliable and robust estimation of vehicle states and road angles. In this direction, developing a flexible and reliable estimation structure at a reasonable cost to operate the available sensor data for the proper functioning of {{active safety systems}} in current vehicles is a preeminent objective of the car manufacturers {{in dealing with the}} technological changes in the automotive industry. This thesis presents a novel generic integrated tire force and velocity estimation system at each corner to monitor tire capacities and slip condition individually and to address road uncertainty issues in the current model-based vehicle state estimators. Tire force estimators are developed using computationally efficient nonlinear and Kalman-based observers and common measurements in production vehicles. The stability and performance of the time-varying estimators are explored and it is shown that the developed integrated structure is robust to model uncertainties including tire properties, inflation pressure, and effective rolling radius, does not need tire parameters and road <b>friction</b> <b>information,</b> and can transfer from one car to another. The main challenges for velocity estimation are the lack of knowledge of road friction in the model-based methods and accumulated error in kinematic-based approaches. To tackle these issues, the lumped LuGre tire model is integrated with the vehicle kinematics in this research. It is shown that the proposed generic corner-based estimator reduces the number of required tire parameters significantly and does not require knowledge of the road friction. The stability and performance of the time-varying velocity estimators are studied and the sensitivity of the observers' stability to the model parameter changes is discussed. The proposed velocity estimators are validated in simulations and road experiments with two vehicles in several maneuvers with various driveline configurations on roads with different friction conditions. The simulation and experimental results substantiate the accuracy and robustness of the state estimators for even harsh maneuvers on surfaces with varying friction. A corner-based lateral state estimation is also developed for conventional cars application independent of the wheel torques. This approach utilizes variable weighted axles' estimates and high slip detection modules to deal with uncertainties associated with longitudinal forces in large steering. Therefore, the output of the lateral estimator is not altered by the longitudinal force effect and its performance is not compromised. A method for road classification is also investigated utilizing the vehicle lateral response in diverse maneuvers. Moreover, the designed estimation structure is shown to work with various driveline configurations such as front, rear, or all-wheel drive and can be easily reconfigured to operate with different vehicles and control systems' actuator configurations such as differential braking, torque vectoring, or their combinations on the front or rear axles. This research has resulted in two US pending patents on vehicle speed estimation and sensor fault diagnosis and successful transfer of these patents to industry...|$|E

When these models {{are taken to}} data it is typical to use the choices that consumers make from menus of health insurance options to estimate their risk preferences. A key empirical assumption is that, conditioning on observed health risk, risk preferences represent the primary component of persistent unobserved preferences. If other factors, such as information about plan options or perceived plan hassle costs, also impact choices, then risk preference estimates will be biased. In addition to having positive implications for choice predictions, omitting such unobserved choice factors can have normative implications for welfare analysis. In this paper we combine administrative data on health plan choices with unique survey data on consumer beliefs and other unobserved preference factors in order to separately identify risk preferences, <b>information</b> <b>frictions,</b> and plan hassle costs.
