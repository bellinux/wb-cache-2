40|$|An {{analytical}} model is presented for the compressive behaviour of <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric composites under on-axis uniaxial loading. Analysis {{is based on}} curved beams on elastic foundation approach. The contributions of all the three structural elements within the <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric composite, namely longitudinal strand, transverse strand and pure matrix region have been considered. During compressive loading, the load sharing between structural elements is worked out and the stress state throughout the composite is determined. Effect of failed structural elements is taken into account for further calculations. Compressive strength, modulus of elasticity and failure strain data has been generated for different fabric geometries for both <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric E-glass/epoxy and T 300 carbon/epoxy composites. Experiments {{have been carried out}} on typical <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric E-glass/epoxy composites for validation. Effect of fabric geometry on the compressive behaviour of <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric composites has been presented. (C) 2002. ...|$|R

Comparison is made between the off-axis elastic properties of <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric laminates and cross-ply laminates.

The primary {{focus is on}} the effect of specimen thickness on quasi-static shear plugging behaviour. In the present study, quasi-static shear plugging and through-the-thickness frictional tests are carried out on three types of materials. The materials investigated are 2 D <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> E-glass/epoxy, 2 D <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> T 300 carbon/epoxy and 2 D <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> E-glass fabric.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to {{investigate}} the influence of weave structures and silica coatings obtained via sol-gel process on the thermal insulation properties of cotton samples. For this reason three main <b>weave</b> structures (<b>plain,</b> satin, and piqué) of cotton fabric were selected with different yarn count, threads per cm, and mass per square meter values. Thereafter, only for the <b>plain</b> <b>weave,</b> the samples were padded using silica sol formed by hydrolysis and subsequent condensation of 3 -glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane under acidic conditions. The silanized <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> samples were characterized by TGA and FT-IR techniques. The thermal properties were measured with a home-made apparatus in order to calculate thermal conductivity, resistance, and absorption of all the treated fabric samples. The relationship between the thermal insulation properties of the <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabrics and the concentration of sol solutions has been investigated. Fabrics weave and density were found to strongly influence the thermal properties: piqué always shows the lowest values and satin shows the highest values while <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> lies in between. The thermal properties of treated high-density cotton <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric were proved to be strongly influenced by finishing agent concentration...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two-dimensional {{models are}} {{presented}} for the elastic {{analysis of a}} <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric lamina.

Typical studies on the effect of fiber undulation and lamina thickness on the in-plane elastic constants are presented. A large discrepancy, similar to that reported in literature, is found between the predicted elastic moduli of <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> fabric lamina by ID WF models and experimental results. On the other hand, the predictions of 2 D WF models are fairly good since the two-dimensional extent of the fabric is considered in these models.

40|$|Investigations {{are carried}} out on the {{behavior}} of typical <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> E-glass/epoxy; <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> carbon/epoxy; satin weave carbon/epoxy; and satin <b>weave</b> carbon - <b>plain</b> <b>weave</b> E-glass and epoxy hybrid composites under high strain rate compressive loading along thickness direction. Compressive split Hopkinson pressure bar apparatus was used for the studies. Two loading cases, namely, specimen not failed and specimen failed during loading are investigated. The special characteristics of specimen not failed case are presented. For this case, the specimens are under compressive strain initially and are under tensile strain during the later part of loading. The induced tensile strain is higher than the induced compressive strain. This could lead to failure of specimen/structure under tensile strain even though the applied load is compressive.

From the simulated deformed solid RVE, a complementary periodic fluid RVE is then built and the slow flow of an incompressible Newtonian fluid within it is investigated. This allows to compute, in a second step, the permeability of the deformed <b>plain</b> <b>weave.</b> The role of the shear deformation on the permeability of multi-layers or single layer preforms is discussed...|$|R
