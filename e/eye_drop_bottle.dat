Topically applied carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) in <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> solutions are commonly used to treat glaucoma. However, local eye irritation and multiple daily administrations may hamper their clinical usefulness. Aqueous <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> formulations that improve their topical bioavailability and reduce their eye irritation can improve their clinical efficacy. Earlier studies showed that dorzolamide and closely related CAIs are more effectively delivered into the eye from acidic <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> solutions than from comparable neutral solutions. Consequently, dorzolamide was marketed as an aqueous pH 5. 6 <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> solution (Trusopt(®), Merck). Later, it was shown that increasing the pH of the <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> from pH 5. 6 to physiologic pH significantly reduced their local irritation. Earlier attempts to use cyclodextrins (CDs) as ocular penetration enhancers in dorzolamide <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> solutions failed since; although the CDs were able to enhance the aqueous solubility of dorzolamide, increasing the pH from 5. 6 to physiologic pH reduced {{the ability of the}} drug to permeate into the eye. Later, it was discovered that formulating the drug as aqueous dorzolamide/γCD <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> microparticle suspension resulted in significant bioavailability enhancement. The solid dorzolamide/γCD microparticles are mucoadhesive and release dorzolamide into the aqueous tear fluid for extended time period. Consequently, sustained high dorzolamide concentrations in aqueous humour and various eye tissues were observed after single administration of the aqueous dorzolamide/γCD <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> microsuspension.

Here it is described how, through proper analysis of the drug permeation barriers and application of well-known pharmaceutical excipients, aqueous <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> are designed that can deliver lipophilic drugs to the posterior segment as well as how such <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> can maintain high drug concentrations in the anterior segment.

The incidence and severity of superficial punctate keratitis (SPK), patient gender and age, type of glaucoma, and type of <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> were recorded.

ConclusionsThere is no difference between the <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> with or without BAK in lowering intraocular pressure, but the latter is of higher safety. In consideration of the relatively small sample size of this research, more high-quality clinical research contrasts are needed as evidence...|$|R
40|$|To {{evaluate}} the comparative efficacy of Ayurvedic formulation a Rasanjana Madhu (RM) <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> and Honey Rose (HR) water <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> in Netra Abhishyanda in mucopurulent conjunctivitis, {{the current study}} is planned. Total of 35 patients attending the outpatient department of Shalakya Tantra at R. G. G. Postgraduate Ayurvedic College, Paprola, Distt. Kangra, Himachal Pradesh with characteristic features of Netra Abhishyanda were selected for the present study. Twenty patients were given trial drug, i. e., RM <b>eye</b> <b>drops,</b> while 15 patients were given HR <b>eye</b> <b>drops.</b> Random sampling technique was adopted for the present study. The duration of the treatment was 7 days with 1 week follow-up. Patients receiving the trial group demonstrated reduction of redness, burning sensation, lacrimation, photophobia, foreign body sensation, discharge, and congestion, which were statistically significant with 93 % patients cured or markedly improved category. Signs and symptoms stated above were also statistically reduced with HR <b>eye</b> <b>drops,</b> probably because of well-documented hygroscopic and bacteriocidal properties of honey. Based on the study, it can be concluded that, RM <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> are very effective in the management of Netra Abhishyanda viz. Infective conjunctivitis...|$|R

40|$|Kenji Inoue Inouye Eye Hospital, Tokyo, Japan Abstract: Glaucoma is a chronic, {{progressive}} disease in which retinal ganglion cells ­disappear and subsequent, gradual {{reductions in the}} visual field ensues. Glaucoma <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> have hypotensive effects and like all other medications are associated with adverse effects. Adverse reactions may either result from the main agent or from preservatives used in the drug vehicle. The preservative benzalkonium chloride, is one such compound that causes frequent adverse reactions such as superficial punctate keratitis, corneal erosion, conjunctival allergy, and conjunctival injection. Adverse reactions related to main hypotensive agents have been divided into those affecting the eye and those affecting the entire body. In particular, β-blockers frequently cause systematic adverse reactions, including bradycardia, decrease in blood pressure, irregular pulse and asthma attacks. Prostaglandin analogs have distinctive local adverse reactions, including eyelash bristling/lengthening, eyelid pigmentation, iris pigmentation, and upper eyelid deepening. No systemic adverse reactions {{have been linked to}} prostaglandin analog <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> usage. These adverse reactions may be minimized when they are detected early and prevented by reducing the number of different <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> used (via fixed combination <b>eye</b> <b>drops),</b> reducing the number of times <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> are administered, using benzalkonium chloride-free <b>eye</b> <b>drops,</b> using lower concentration <b>eye</b> <b>drops,</b> and providing proper drop instillation training. Additionally, a one-time topical medication can be given to patients to allow observation of any adverse reactions, thereafter the preparation of a topical medication with the fewest known adverse reactions can be prescribed. This does require precise patient monitoring and inquiries about patient symptoms following medication use.
