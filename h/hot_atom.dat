40|$|The initial goal of {{this work}} was to build up an entirely new {{low-temperature}} scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and ultrahigh vacuum system to examine the electron- and photon-induced chemistry of single molecules at low surface temperatures where thermal diffusion would be quenched. The photochemistry of methyl bromide on Pt(111) was first examined at 90 K using liquid nitrogen cooling. Br atoms were quite mobile even at 90 K, and were only visible by STM when coalesced along Pt step edges or in Br islands structures. The 193 nm photofragmentation of methyl bromide efficiently created monovacancies in the substrate at 90 K. It was found that at elevated temperatures there is considerable restructuring and reactive attack of the Pt surface by halogens, but for traditional, lower temperature studies of alkyl radicals prepared by thermal dissociative adsorption of alkyl iodides there is probably no problem with adsorbing I generating monovacancies on the surface. The dynamics of the ho t Br atoms formed by dissociative adsorption of Br{sub 2 } was also examined. It was discovered that hot Br atoms from Br{sub 2 } dissociative adsorption travel farther than hot O atoms from O{sub 2 } dissociative adsorption; <b>hot</b> <b>atom</b> motion from different dissociative adsorption systems had not previously been compared for the same metal substrate. The experimental results strengthened the theoretical case that corrugation of the adsorbate/substrate potential is the key issue in determining <b>hot</b> <b>atom</b> travel.

40|$|AbstractDifferent {{fractions}} of muon environments were studied in methanol within a temperature range of 177 K to 316 K. The diamagnetic fraction does not vary significantly with temperature, while the muonium (Mu) fraction decreases {{by a factor}} of 2 as temperature increases and the lost fraction increases with temperature {{at the expense of the}} Mu fraction It is likely that at low temperatures Mu becomes segregated from solvated electrons created in the spur leading to the increase in Mu fraction and decrease in lost fraction. As internal energy increases, the hydrogen bonding in methanol decreases. This can avoid separation of Mu from the solvated electrons in the radiolysis track increasing thus the likelihood of Mu being dephased by a solvated electron during an encounter.

Nascent <b>hot</b> <b>atoms</b> arise in ground and excited electronic states, and their translational energies are larger by two - three orders of magnitude than the thermal energies of the ambient gas.

Modeling of the non-Maxwellian energy distributions of metastable oxygen and nitrogen atoms have been focused on the determination of their impact on the energetics and chemistry of the terrestrial atmosphere between 25 and 250 km. At this altitudes, we have calculated the energy distribution functions of metastable O and N atoms and computed non-equilibrium rates of important aeronomic reactions, such as destruction of the water molecules by O(1 D) atoms and production of highly excited nitric oxide molecules. In the upper atmosphere, the metastable O(lD) and N(2 D) play important role in formation of the upward atomic fluxes.

Dissociative recombination of molecular oxygen ions and charge exchange of atomic oxygen ions with the neutral hydrogen and oxygen gas are the source terms, and calculations show that the dissociative recombination term is the dominant one. It is shown that measured <b>hot</b> <b>atom</b> concentrations exceed estimates of the thermal hydrogen atom concentrations derived from Brinton et al.

This reactor is used for fast deposition of adherent amorphous silicon carbide films (with Si/C≈ 1. 2) on steel. Optical emission from the plasma was sampled using a high resolution double monochromator (2 m focal length, 1800 grooves/mm) coupled with a multichannel CCD detector. Only the lines corresponding to neutral or ionised Argon (Ar, Ar+), the broadened hydrogen Balmer (Hα et Hβ) and silicon ionised lines (Si+) were clearly pointed out perpendicularly or parallel to the discharge axis.

The reaction probabilities and rate constants {{are believed to}} be accurate to within 2 % or better. The calculations are used to test the approximate theories of chemical dynamics. The reaction probabilities for ground vibrational state reagents agree well with the vibrationally adiabatic theory for energies below the lowest threshold for vibrational excitation, except when the reaction probability is less than about 0. 1. For these low reaction probabilities no simple one-mathematical dimensional theory gives accurate results. These low reaction probabilities occur at low energy and are important for thermal reactions at low temperatures. Thus, transition state theory is very inaccurate at these low temperatures. However, it is accurate within 40 % in the higher temperature range 450 – 1250 °K. The reaction probabilities for <b>hot</b> <b>atom</b> collisions of ground vibrational state reagents with translational energies in the range 0. 58 to 0. 95 eV agree qualitatively with the predictions of the statistical phase space theory.
