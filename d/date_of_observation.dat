Potential biases existing in the data set were identified and analytical procedures suggested to deal with such biases. Results from analyses within the State of North Carolina suggest that the time series of the NDVI values is influenced by sensitivities to residual cloud contamination, preceeding climatic events, temporal and spatial scales of analyses, and the composition and spatial organization of the study area. Spatial and temporal discontinuities within and between images, irregular space‐time semivariograms, and statistical summaries of the data show the existence of biases in the data set for North Carolina. Possible adjustments to reduce this level of uncertainty include the generation of NDVI composites over longer time periods, exclusion of suspected contaminated data, or the use of spatial and temporal interpolations of contaminated values to reduce their relative impact on each composite image. Regional variations in NDVI responses to viewing and illumination geometry may also be important factors for users to consider...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Shutter-speed model {{analysis}} of dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging allows estimation of mean intracellular water molecule lifetime (a measure of cellular energy metabolism) and volume transfer constant (a measure of hemodynamics). The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate the prognostic utility of pretreatment mean intracellular water molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant in predicting overall survival in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck and to stratify p 16 -positive patients based upon survival outcome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cohort of 60 patients underwent dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging before treatment. Median, mean intracellular water molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant values from metastatic nodes were computed from each patient. Kaplan-Meier analyses were performed to associate mean intracellular water molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant and their combination with overall survival for the first 2 years, 5 years, and beyond (median duration, > 7 years). RESULTS: By the last <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation,</b> 18 patients had died, and median follow-up for surviving patients (n = 42) was 8. 32 years. Patients with high mean intracellular water molecule lifetime (4 deaths) had significantly (P =. 01) prolonged overall survival by 5 years compared with those with low mean intracellular water molecule lifetime (13 deaths). Similarly, patients with high mean intracellular water molecule lifetime (4 deaths) had significantly (P =. 006) longer overall survival at long-term duration than those with low mean intracellular water molecule lifetime (14 deaths). However, volume transfer constant was a significant predictor for only the 5 -year follow-up period. There was some evidence (P <. 10) to suggest that mean intracellular water molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant were associated with overall survival for the first 2 years. Patients with high mean intracellular water molecule lifetime and high volume transfer constant were associated with significantly (P <. 01) longer overall survival compared with other groups for all follow-up periods. In addition, p 16 -positive patients with high mean intracellular water molecule lifetime and high volume transfer constant demonstrated a trend toward the longest overall survival. CONCLUSIONS: A combined {{analysis of}} mean intracellular water molecule lifetime and volume transfer constant provided the best model to predict overall survival in patients with squamous cell carcinomas of the head and neck...|$|E

This study {{examines}} {{the determinants of}} earnings quality (quality of earnings information), which include: debt, dividend, profitability, firm age, firm size, and growth. Earnings quality {{is important because it}} has the value relevance of earnings quality and has an impact on the cost of capital. However, companies listed on the Stock Exchange are companies with low earnings quality. Therefore, study on the factors that affect the quality of earnings in Indonesia is interesting. The method of analysis used in this study is multiple regression with the quality of earnings as the dependent variable and debt, dividends, profitability, firm age, firm size, and growth as an independent variables. Earnings quality is measured by abnormal accruals, while the independent variables, respectively, measured by: the ratio of debt / equity, cash dividend payment status, return on assets (ROA), financial reporting <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> minus the year of incorporation date divided by 365, and the market value of the stock divided by the book value. This study used data of financial statements of non-financial companies listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange (BEI) for the period 2007 - 2010 for the measurement of variables and the period 2008 - 2010 for analysis. This study provide empirical evidence that 4 (four) of the six (6) variables tested, namely debt, dividends, profitability, and firm size are associated with earnings quality, while the 2 (two) other variables, namely age and growth companies do not have relationship with the quality of earnings. The results of this study are expected to contribute to the literature of accounting, finance, and capital markets by providing empirical evidence about the determinants of the quality of earnings. It is also expected that findings of this study can be utilized by various parties as consideration in carrying out their respective functions, among others by: investor in investment decisions, management in the reporting of financial information, financial accounting standards board in the preparation of financial accounting standards and capital market authorities in drafting the regulation of capital markets.

Soil physical and chemical laboratory analyses results were provided by the JRC-IES SOIL action (formerly JRC FP 6 MOSES action). The 376 soil samples, used in this study, were collected for previous projects of the IES SOIL action and its partners within {{a wide range of}} environmental settings in Italy. Reflectance measurements were obtained on disturbed soil samples using an ASD Field Spec Pro spectro-radiometer. Data transformation methods (standardisation, vector-normalisation and first and second order derivatives) have been applied on the spectral data. The transformed spectral data have been used for the prediction of SOM and carbonate content using the partial least squares regression (PLSR). The results (R 2 between 0. 57 and 0. 8) demonstrate the successful {{application of}} reflectance spectroscopy combined with chemometric modelling for the estimation of SOM and carbonate content. The calibration models demonstrated a tolerable stability over a variety of different soil types, which is a positive factor for opening the opportunity to use this methodology for monitoring larger areas. Furthermore it could be shown, that the spectral resolution of the MERIS sensor is sufficient for approximation of the SOC/SOM content from pure soil spectra. Consequently {{the second part of the}} study focused on the use of MERIS satellite data for the estimation of soil organic carbon content of bare soils at regional scale. The study concentrated on the Apulia region, where we had high density of available field sampling sites, and on parts of the coastal areas of the Abruzzi region South of Pescara, which are known to be amongst the more critical areas in Italy suffering from land degradation problems and desertification risk. For specific morphological-lithological units simple spectral models, based on soil colour and spectral shape attributes, were built to derive soil organic carbon content. In order to apply these models to MERIS satellite data, a time series of images covering the years 2003 and 2004 were acquired for Southern Italy. Pre-processing of image data aimed at extracting those pixels with negligible vegetation abundance at least at one <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> per year, i. e. practically showing pure bare soil signatures only, and consisted of: ¿	geometrical co-registration and superposition of images from different acquisition dates ¿	the derivation of minimum vegetation composites for each year applying simple minimum value criteria for MERIS vegetation indices ¿	the determination of soil and vegetation abundance at sub-pixel level based on spectral mixture modelling. ¿	the removal of residual vegetation influence from image spectra Soil colour attributes (soil lightness, R coordinate of R-G-B model) and coefficients of a second order polynomial fitted through the pixel reflectance signatures were derived from the minimum vegetation composites of both years. The spatial distribution of soil organic carbon was estimated for each year within specific morphological-lithological units in the Apulia region. In addition models could be applied to other regions in Southern Italy. Estimation results showed good agreement with independent field data and the pedo-transfer rules based estimations of Jones et. al. (2004, 2005). JRC. H. 7 -Land management and natural hazard...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{response}} to seeing a man riding a unicycle {{was reported to}} be consistently related to the viewer’s sex and stage of physical development. To see if this observation was universal, <b>observations</b> <b>of</b> responses were collected from 23 male and 9 female unicyclists aged 15 – 69 years, with 2 – 40 years cycling experience across four continents. With two exceptions among men, the findings were the same as those originally reported: children showed interest and curiosity, young girls showed little interest, while adult women showed a kindly, concerned, praising response. By contrast, boys showed physical aggression, which became more verbal, merging in the later teens to the snide, aggressive, stereotyped humorous response shown by adult males, which became less frequent in elderly men. The universality of the response across different individuals, environments, and <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> suggests an endogenous mechanism, and the association with masculine development relates this to androgen. The theoretical consequences are discussed. It is concluded that humor develops from aggression in males and is evolutionarily related to sexual selection...|$|R
30|$|Quantitative phenological {{studies and}} {{research}} that elucidates {{the levels of}} asynchrony among individuals and between species will help to understand the impact of climate change on tropical trees, {{as well as the}} potential consequences of these changes on the ecological community as a whole (Singh and Kushwaha 2005). The seasonality of tropical tree phenology is mainly determined by the duration and intensity of seasonal drought (Mooney et al. 1995); even conspecific trees often experience differing degrees of drought stress (Singh and Kushwaha 2005) and resource availability for consumer animals (Morellato et al. 2000). However few reports are available on seasonality studies in India (Singh and Singh 1992; Murali and Sukumar 1993, 1994; Bhat 1992; Prasad and Hegde 1986).With exception of the dry forest, montane forests in Niligiri have been reported in seasonality studies (Suresh and Sukumar 2011). In this paper we analyzed the phenological pattern in relation to rainfall, temperature, and circular statistics using the various phenophases and <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> to address: 1) phenology of various tree species; 2) analysis of factors controlling phenology; and 3) seasonality of various phenophases.|$|R
40|$|Recorded <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> heliacal risings of {{the star}} Sirius as {{reported}} from ancient Egypt {{have been used for}} chronological purposes for more than 100 years. This paper presents new calculations of heliacal risings and settings of Sirius for different places in Egypt and discusses the influences of various parameters and their uncertainties on the results. Comparison with ancient Egyptian observations gives a mean value for the arcus visionis of Sirius of about 10 °, with plausible values between 9 ° and 11 ° depending on the transparency of the atmosphere. This means that a <b>date</b> <b>of</b> a heliacal rising or setting of Sirius, which was recorded in the Egyptian calendar, can pin down the absolute <b>dating</b> <b>of</b> the <b>observation</b> to 12 years, if one assumes that the place <b>of</b> <b>observation</b> is known and if no further information, e. g. lunar data, is available.
