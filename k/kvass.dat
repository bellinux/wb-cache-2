5|$|Similar to {{some other}} red dyes {{obtained}} from scale insects, the red coloring is derived from carminic acid with traces of kermesic acid. The Polish cochineal carminic acid content is approximately 0.6% of the insect's dried body weight. The insects were harvested shortly before the female larvae reached maturity, i.e. in late June, usually around Saint John the Baptist's day (June 24), hence the dye's folk name, Saint John's blood. The harvesting process involved uprooting the host plant and picking the female larvae, averaging approximately ten insects from each plant. In Poland, including present-day Ukraine, and elsewhere in Europe, plantations were operated {{in order to deal}} with the high toll on the host plants. The larvae were killed with boiling water or vinegar and dried in the sun or in an oven, ground, and dissolved in sourdough or in light rye beer called <b>kvass</b> in order to remove fat. The extract could then be used for dyeing silk, wool, cotton, or linen. The dyeing process requires roughly 3-4oz of dye per pound (180-250g per kilogram) of silk and one pound of dye to color almost 20pounds (50g per kilogram) of wool.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kvass</b> was {{reported}} to be consumed in excess by peasants, low-class citizens, and monks; in fact, it is sometimes said that it was usual for them to drink more <b>kvass</b> than water. In the 19th century, the <b>kvass</b> industry was created and less natural versions of the drink became increasingly widespread. On the other hand, the popularity of <b>kvass</b> and the market competition led to the emergence of many varieties, which included herbs, fruits and berries. At that time <b>kvass</b> vendors called kvasnik (pl. kvasniki) were on the streets in almost every city. They often specialized in particular kinds of kvass: strawberry <b>kvass,</b> apple <b>kvass,</b> etc.|$|E
25|$|The <b>kvass</b> most {{commonly}} used in cooking is white okroshka <b>kvass,</b> {{which is much more}} sour than drinking <b>kvass.</b> Spices used include mustard, black pepper and pickled cucumber (specifically, the liquid from the pickles), solely or in combination. For the final touch, boiled eggs and smetana (similar to crème fraîche) are added.|$|E
25|$|After {{the fall}} of the Soviet Union in 1991, the street vendors {{disappeared}} from the streets of Latvia due to new health laws that banned its sale on the street. Economic disruptions forced many <b>kvass</b> factories to close. The Coca-Cola Company moved in and quickly dominated the market for soft drinks. In 1998 the local soft drink industry adapted by selling bottled <b>kvass</b> and launching aggressive marketing campaigns. This surge in sales was stimulated by the fact that <b>kvass</b> sold for about half the price of Coca-Cola. In just three years, <b>kvass</b> constituted as much as 30% of the soft drink market in Latvia, while the market share of Coca-Cola fell from 65% to 44%. The Coca-Cola company had losses in Latvia of about $1 million in 1999 and 2000. The situation was similar in the other Baltic countries and Russia. Coca-Cola responded by buying <b>kvass</b> manufacturers as well as making <b>kvass</b> at their own soft drink plants.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, <b>kvass</b> is {{practically}} unknown, {{as there are}} no cultural ties to it within the nation's history {{and there are no}} renowned <b>kvass</b> breweries in the country. However, with the influx of immigrants following the 2004 enlargement of the European Union, a number of stores selling cuisine and beverages from Eastern Europe cropped up throughout the UK, many of them storing <b>kvass</b> on their shelves.|$|E
25|$|Much like {{in other}} Eastern European countries, <b>kvass</b> has {{historical}} roots in Poland – mainly {{due to the}} trade between the Kingdom of Poland and Kievan Rus'. <b>Kvass</b> may have appeared in Poland {{as early as the}} 10th century. The production of <b>kvass</b> went on for several hundred years, as recipes were passed down from parent to offspring. This continued in the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. It was at first commonly drunk among peasants who worked on the fields and eventually spread to the szlachta (Polish nobility). One example of this is kwas chlebowy sapieżyński kodeński, an old type of Polish <b>kvass</b> that is still sold as a contemporary brand. Its origins {{can be traced back to}} the 1500s, when Jan Sapieha – a magnate of the House of Sapieha – was granted land by the Polish king. On those lands he founded the town of Kodeń. He then bought the mills and 24 villages of the surrounding areas from their previous landowners. It was then that the taste of <b>kvass</b> became known among the Polish szlachta, who used it for its supposed healing qualities. After the last Partition of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth in 1795, Poland ceased to be an independent state. Throughout the 19th century, <b>kvass</b> remained popular among Poles who lived in the Russian Empire, especially the inhabitants of rural areas.|$|E
25|$|Chilled soups {{based on}} <b>kvass,</b> such as tyurya, okroshka, and botvinya.|$|E
25|$|While <b>kvass</b> {{used to be}} {{consumed}} widely in most Slavic countries, its popularity spread to Latvia and Lithuania. Today it forms {{the basis of a}} multimillion-dollar industry, though it has been struggling ever since the introduction of Western soft drinks in Eastern European countries. <b>Kvass</b> was once sold during the summer only, but is now produced, packaged, and sold year-round.|$|E
25|$|The name of Kvasir, a wise {{being in}} Norse mythology, is {{possibly}} related to <b>kvass.</b>|$|E
25|$|Commercial <b>kvass,</b> {{especially}} {{less expensive}} varieties, is occasionally made {{like many other}} soft drinks, using sugar, carbonated water, malt extract, and flavourings. Better brands, often made by beer rather than soft drink manufacturers, usually use {{a variation of the}} traditional process to brew their products. <b>Kvass</b> is commonly served unfiltered, with the yeast still in it, which adds to its unique flavour as well as its high vitamin B content.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kvass</b> {{has been}} a common drink in Eastern Europe {{since at least the}} Middle Ages, {{comparable}} with other ancient fermented grain beverages including beer brewed from barley by the ancient Egyptians, the pombe or millet beer of Africa, the so-called rice wines of Asia, the chicha made with corn or cassava by the natives of America. <b>Kvass</b> was invented by the Slavs and became the most popular among East Slavs.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kvass,</b> a Russia-originated {{fermented}} beverage made from black or regular rye bread, is also popular in Harbin.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kvass</b> {{is made by}} {{the natural}} {{fermentation}} of bread, such as wheat, rye, or barley, and sometimes flavoured using fruit, berries, raisins, or birch sap collected in the early spring. Modern homemade <b>kvass</b> most often uses black or regular rye bread, usually dried (called plural suhari), baked into croutons, or fried, {{with the addition of}} sugar or fruit (e.g. apples or raisins), and with a yeast culture and zakvaska ("kvass fermentation starter").|$|E
25|$|Gira (<b>kvass)</b> is a non {{alcoholic}} beverage {{made by the}} natural fermentation of wheat, rye, or barley bread, sometimes flavoured with fruit, berries, raisins or birch sap; it is similar to Russian or Ukrainian <b>kvass.</b> Those brewed from rye bread and from caraway seed are popular and distributed in glass bottles. There is also a carbonated soft drink known as gira, which is distributed in plastic bottles, but it shares neither taste nor production technology with the original beverage.|$|E
25|$|Russian cuisine widely uses fish, poultry, mushrooms, berries, and honey. Crops of rye, wheat, barley, and millet {{provide the}} {{ingredients}} for a plethora of breads, pancakes, cereals, <b>kvass,</b> beer, and vodka. Black bread is relatively more popular in Russia compared {{to the rest of}} the world.|$|E
25|$|Tyurya is {{very similar}} to okroshka, the main {{difference}} being that instead of vegetables, bread is soaked in <b>kvass.</b> It was commonly consumed during rough times such as (the Russian Revolution, World War I, World War II) and by poor peasants. Also, due to its simplicity, it was very common as a meal during religious fasting.|$|E
25|$|In Lithuania <b>kvass</b> {{is known}} as gira and is widely {{available}} in bottles and draft. Many restaurants in Vilnius make their own gira, which they sell on the premises. Strictly speaking, gira {{can be made from}} anything fermentable — such as caraway tea, beetroot juice, or berries — but it is made mainly from black bread or barley/rye malt.|$|E
25|$|As {{its primary}} {{ingredient}} is rye, <b>kvass</b> {{is a good}} source of vitamin B-1 and B-6, magnesium, phosphorus, amino acids, and pantothenate. It is also rich in lactic acid and simple sugars, which contributes to its pleasant, thirst-quenching taste, provides ample calories to fuel physical activity, and may improve digestion, as with other lacto-fermented foods such as yogurt and sauerkraut.|$|E
25|$|Many {{traditional}} {{drinks are}} indigenous to Russia {{and are not}} present in other national cuisines. The most notable of these are vodka, sbiten', <b>kvass,</b> medovukha and mors. Many of them are no longer common and {{have been replaced by}} drinks originating in Europe. Nonetheless, these beverages were formerly drunk as a compliment to meat and poultry dishes, sweet porridge, and dessert. Of particular note is sbiten, an immensely popular medieval drink which has since been replaced by tea as the Russian mainstay beverage.|$|E
25|$|Solyanka is a thick, piquant soup that {{combines}} components from shchi (cabbage, smetana) and rassolnik (pickle water and cucumbers), spices such as olives, capers, tomatoes, lemons, lemon juice, <b>kvass,</b> salted and pickled mushrooms {{make up a}} considerably strong sour-salty base of the soup. Solyanka is much thicker than other soups, about 1/3 less liquid ratio. Three types are distinguished: meat, fish, and simple solyanka. The first two are cooked on strong meat or fish broths, and the last on mushroom or vegetable broth. All the broths are mixed with cucumber pickle water.|$|E
25|$|Russian cuisine widely uses fish, poultry, mushrooms, berries, and honey. Crops of rye, wheat, barley, and millet {{provide the}} {{ingredients}} for various breads, pancakes and cereals, {{as well as for}} <b>kvass,</b> beer and vodka drinks. Black bread is rather popular in Russia, compared {{to the rest of the}} world. Flavourful soups and stews include shchi, borsch, ukha, solyanka and okroshka. Smetana (a heavy sour cream) is often added to soups and salads. Pirozhki, blini and syrniki are native types of pancakes. Chicken Kiev, pelmeni and shashlyk are popular meat dishes, the last two being of Tatar and Caucasus origin respectively. Other meat dishes include stuffed cabbage rolls (golubtsy) usually filled with meat. Salads include Olivier salad, vinegret and dressed herring.|$|E
25|$|Historically {{the most}} {{widespread}} non-alcoholic beverage among the peasantry was <b>kvass,</b> adopted later by Polish nobility also, mainly due to its supposed healing qualities. In contemporary times, tea {{is perhaps the most}} popular, drunk sometimes with a slice of lemon and sweetened with sugar. Tea came into Poland from England shortly after its appearance in Western Europe, mainly due to the Dutch merchants. However its prevalence is attributed to the Russian invaders in the 19th century – at this time samovars imported from Russia become commonplace in Polish homes. Coffee is also widely drunk in Poland since the 18th century. Frequently consumed beverages also include: buttermilk, kefir, soured milk, instant coffee, various mineral waters and juices. Following the fall of communism in 1989, numerous brands of soft drink have also become popular.|$|E
500|$|Borscht also {{evolved into}} a variety of sour soups to the east of Poland. Examples include onion borscht, a recipe for which was {{included}} in a 1905 Russian cookbook, and sorrel-based green borscht, which is still a popular summer soup in Ukraine and Russia. A Gift to Young Housewives by Elena Molokhovets, the best-selling Russian cookbook of the 19th century, first published in 1861, contains nine recipes for borscht, some of which are based on <b>kvass,</b> a traditional Slavic fermented beverage made from rye bread. Kvass-based variants were also known in Ukraine at that time; some of them were types of green borscht, while others were similar to the Russian [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{dominant}} tastes in borscht are {{sweet and}} sour. This combination is traditionally obtained by adding beet sour. It {{is made by}} covering sliced beetroots with lukewarm preboiled water and allowing bacteria to ferment some of the sugars present in beetroots into dextran (which gives the liquid a slightly viscous consistency), mannitol, acetic acid and lactic acid. Stale rye bread is often added to hasten the process, but usually omitted in Jewish recipes, as chametz (leavened bread) would make the sour unfit for Passover meals. Sugar, salt and lemon juice may be also added to balance the flavor. After about 2–5 days (or 2–3 weeks without the bread), the deep red, sweet and sour liquid may be strained and is ready to use. It is added to borscht shortly before the soup is done, as prolonged boiling would cause the tart flavor to dissipate. The beet sour is known in Slavic languages as kvas (literally 'sour, acid'; compare <b>kvass)</b> and in Yiddish as [...] (from a Slavic word originally referring to any brine obtained by steeping salted meat or vegetables in water; compare Russian [...] 'pickle juice', Polish [...] 'broth'). Apart from its employment in borscht, it may be also added to prepared horseradish or used as pot roast marinade.|$|E
2500|$|In Fyodor Dostoyevsky's The Brothers Karamazov, monastery <b>kvass</b> is {{mentioned}} in the dinner scene as being famous throughout the neighborhood. In Leo Tolstoy's The Death of Ivan Ilyich, <b>kvass</b> is made first thing on a holiday morning. In Ivan Goncharov's Oblomov and in Tolstoy's Anna Karenina, <b>kvass</b> is repeatedly mentioned. In Tolstoy's War and Peace, French soldiers are aware of <b>kvass</b> on entering Moscow, enjoying it but referring to it as [...] "pig's lemonade". In Anton Chekhov's The Cherry Orchard, <b>kvass</b> {{is mentioned}} early in the play, [...] "Bring me some <b>kvass,</b> would you?" [...] In Sholem Aleichem's Motl, Peysi the Cantor's Son, diluted <b>kvass</b> {{is the focus of}} one of Motl's older brother's get-rich-quick schemes.|$|E
2500|$|Although the {{introduction}} of western soft drinks such as Coca-Cola and Pepsi had reduced the commercial sale of <b>kvass</b> in Russia, <b>kvass</b> has been more recently marketed as a [...] "patriotic" [...] alternative to cola, sparking a [...] "kvass revival". For example, the Russian company Nikola (by coincidence its name sounds like [...] "not cola" [...] in Russian) has promoted its brand of <b>kvass</b> with an advertising campaign emphasizing [...] "anti cola-nisation." [...] Moscow-based Business Analytica reported in 2008 that bottled <b>kvass</b> sales had tripled since 2005 and estimated that per-capita consumption of <b>kvass</b> in Russia would reach three liters in 2008. Between 2005 and 2007, cola's share of the Moscow soft drink market fell from 37% to 32%. Meanwhile, kvass' share more than doubled over the same time period, reaching 16% in 2007. In response, Coca-Cola launched its own brand of <b>kvass</b> in May 2008. This {{is the first time}} a foreign company has made an appreciable entrance into the Russian <b>kvass</b> market. Pepsi has also signed an agreement with a Russian <b>kvass</b> manufacturer to act as a distribution agent. The development of new technologies for storage and distribution, and heavy advertising, have contributed to this surge in popularity; three new major brands have been introduced since 2004.|$|E
2500|$|The only breweries in the United States that brew <b>kvass</b> {{all year}} round are the [...] in Beaver Falls, Pennsylvania, where it is made with the {{addition}} of raisins and lemons, and Kolokol <b>kvass</b> in Helena, Montana, using traditional ingredients (water, sugar, rye bread, yeast). Iggy's Foods, LLC, a company based in Bainbridge Island, Washington, produces a live, cultured raw-food Ginger Beet <b>kvass</b> made with beets, Hawaiian ginger, limes, and Himalayan sea salt. , a wholesale fermenter in Ann Arbor, Michigan, sells beet and tomato <b>kvass</b> as well as seasonal varieties.|$|E
2500|$|In Joris-Karl Huysmans' Against Nature (À rebours) {{the protagonist}} Jean Des Esseintes serves <b>kvass,</b> along with porter and stout, for a funeral banquet [...] "in {{memory of the}} host's virility, lately but only {{temporarily}} deceased." [...] In Jules Verne's 1896 novel Michael Strogoff, Courier of the Czar, the titular character drinks <b>kvass</b> when he stops to change horses at post stations {{on his way to}} Siberia. <b>Kvass</b> has also appeared in Russian fantasy novels, such as the 2008 Twilight Watch.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Kvass</b> is {{an ancient}} and still widely popular bread-based drink. The basic method of {{preparing}} <b>kvass</b> includes water, flour and liquid malt; these ingredients are {{used to make a}} dough that is subjected to fermentation. This results in a beverage with very low alcohol content. Commercial <b>kvass</b> is often around 0.5% alcohol. The fermented liquid, referred to as [...] "zator," [...] is diluted with water and mixed with yeast, sugar, and aromatic additives. This final mixture is allowed to brew for several days. Flavor additives may include fruit and berry juices (cherry, raspberry, lemon, etc.), as well as ginger and mint.|$|E
2500|$|Although not {{as popular}} in Poland {{nowadays}} {{as it is}} in Russia or Ukraine, <b>kvass</b> can still be found in many supermarkets and grocery shops throughout the nation where it is known in Polish as kwas chlebowy (...) [...] Commercial bottled versions of the drink are the most common variant, as there are companies that specialize in manufacturing a more modern version of the drink (some variants are manufactured in Poland whilst others are imported from its neighbouring countries, Lithuania and Ukraine being the most popular source. However, recipes for a traditional version of <b>kvass</b> exist; some of them originate from Eastern Poland. Although commercial <b>kvass</b> is much easier to find in Polish shops, Polish manufacturers of more natural and healthier variants of <b>kvass</b> have become increasingly popular both within and outside of the country's borders – one good example being a company that has made itself known not only on the Polish market, but also in Slovakia. Street vendors selling fresh <b>kvass</b> also appear from time to time, especially during summer in cities like Zakopane, where tourists sometimes crowd the streets seeking refreshment on a hot day.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{especially}} popular {{in most of}} the [...] "North Slavic" [...] countries (except for the Czech Republic and Slovakia) like Poland, as well as Latvia, Lithuania, Estonia, and Serbia, but also well-known throughout Mongolia, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and Armenia. Many <b>kvass</b> vendors there sell the drink in the streets. <b>Kvass</b> is also popular in Harbin and Xinjiang, China, where Russian culture has had an influence.|$|E
2500|$|Botvinya {{is another}} type of cold soup. The name of the soup comes from the Russian word botva, which means [...] "leafy tops of root vegetables", and, true to its name, it is made with the leafy tops of young beets, sorrel, scallions, dill, cucumbers, and two types of <b>kvass.</b> Mustard, garlic, and {{horseradish}} are then added for flavor. The vegetables are rubbed through a sieve and <b>kvass</b> is poured over.|$|E
2500|$|Production of the {{beverage}} in Poland on an industrial scale {{can be traced}} back to the more recent interwar period, when the Polish state regained independence as the Second Polish Republic. In interwar Poland, <b>kvass</b> was brewed and sold in mass numbers by magnates of the Polish drinks market like the Varsovian brewery Haberbusch i Schiele or the Karpiński company. <b>Kvass</b> was exceptionally popular in Eastern Poland, partly due to the plentiful numbers of Belarusian and Ukrainian minorities that lived there. However, with the collapse of many prewar businesses and much of the Polish industry during World War II, <b>kvass</b> lost popularity following the aftermath of the war. It was reintroduced industrially after the formation of the People's Republic of Poland as a satellite state of the USSR, though much like in other Slavic and Baltic countries it lost favour upon the introduction of Coca-Cola onto the Eastern European market and once again during the economic crisis of the 1980s in Poland. The collapse of the Eastern Bloc between 1989–1991 was followed by the arrival of other Western soft-drinks in former Soviet countries. Even though <b>kvass</b> isn't as popular as it used to be, it is gaining more and more popularity once again.|$|E
2500|$|Okroshka {{is a cold}} soup {{based on}} <b>kvass</b> or sour milk. Okroshka is also a salad. The main {{ingredients}} {{are two types of}} vegetables that can be mixed with cold boiled meat or fish in a 1:1 proportion [...] Thus vegetable, meat, poultry, and fish varieties of okroshka are made.|$|E
2500|$|The word <b>kvass</b> {{is derived}} from Old Church Slavonic [...] from Proto-Slavic [...] ('leaven', 'fermented drink') and {{ultimately}} from Proto-Indo-European base [...] Today the words used are almost the same: in Belarusian: , Chinese: , Latvian: Polish [...] ('bread kvass'); Russian: , in Ukrainian: , [...] Non-cognates include Lithuanian [...] ('beverage', similar to Latvian [...] ) and Estonian [...]|$|E
