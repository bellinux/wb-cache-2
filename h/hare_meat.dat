50|$|In England, a now rarely served dish is potted hare. The <b>hare</b> <b>meat</b> is cooked, then {{covered in}} at least one inch (preferably more) of butter. The butter is a {{preservative}} (excludes air); the dish can be stored for up to several months. It is served cold, often on bread or as an appetizer.|$|E
50|$|Brown hares are {{mentioned}} in this act but have no closed season. Two hares acts were passed in the 19th century. The first in 1848 permitted the issuing of game licenses, where hunting could take place, and the banning of baiting with poison. The second in Act in 1892, among other things, prohibited the sale of <b>hare</b> <b>meat</b> between March and July which is the animals' breeding season.|$|E
30|$|In <b>hare</b> <b>meat,</b> the {{concentrations}} of WHO-PCDD/F-TEQ were 1.2  pg/g fat and WHO-PCB-TEQ  0.89  pg/g fat. It is seen that PCDD/Fs contributed more to total WHO-TEQ in hare. PBDE concentration was 1.7  ng/g fat. BDE- 209 was clearly the most dominating PBDE congener in hare.|$|E
40|$|<b>Hare</b> <b>meat</b> {{from animals}} {{differently}} reared and fed were analysed {{to compare the}} influence of different rearing techniques, different energy levels of feeds and gender on the productive performances of hares, and on the quantitative characteristics and chemical and fatty acid profile of the meat. The effects of diet and gender did not produce important differences in productive performances and on the quantitative and qualitative parameters under consideration. Statistically {{significant differences were found}} depending on rearing techniques. Those differences for the hares reared in cages referred to better productive performances which favoured fleshier carcasses and a higher accumulation of fat. The acid composition depended on the rearing conditions, which affected the motor activity of the animals and therefore the consumption and the deposit of determined lipid fractions...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn two surveys, thighs of a {{total of}} 137 hunted hares were tested for the {{presence}} of intramuscular shots and femur fractures, which were detected in 42. 7 % and 29. 2 % of 274 thighs, respectively. Femur fractures were significantly associated with the presence of intramuscular shots. In the second survey (46 hares), 92 thighs were grouped into three categories, "A" (no fractures, no intramuscular shot), "B" (one intramuscular shot), and "C" (multiple shots and hematoma), with 49. 0 %, 33. 6 %, and 17. 4 %, respectively. Category "C" was found unfit for human consumption. During 7 -day storage of vacuum-packed "A" and "B" thighs, total aerobic counts increased from initially 3. 3 [*]±[*] 0. 3 (mean[*]±[*]SD) and 4. 1 [*]±[*] 0. 6 log cfu/g by ca. 2 log units when stored at 3 - 4 °C, whereas the increase was clearly < 1 log unit at 0 °C. In comparison to temperature, differences between "A" and "B" category were less pronounced. Similar dynamics were observed for Enterobacteriaceae. In all categories, muscle pH values (mean[*]=[*] 5. 83) were similar. It is concluded that storage at temperatures of ca. 4 °C, although in compliance with EU legislation, does not afford keeping microbial contaminants in check, and thus will not preserve microbiological quality of vacuum-packed <b>hare</b> <b>meat...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{availability}} of hares (Lepus europaeus Pallas), {{unlike that of}} domestic rabbits, is restricted by hunting seasons. Rabbit meat, according to research from Spain, is {{a rich source of}} K, P, Fe and Mg, but poor in Na, being recommended for people with hypertension. The largest quantity of macro minerals studied in rabbit meat was determined for K and P, and the most abundant micro minerals were Zn, Fe, Cu and Mn. In <b>hare</b> <b>meat,</b> ash content is not sufficiently studied. The current low level of knowledge motivated the present study. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish the ash content for major muscle groups and edible offal of hares. The biological material used was collected from 49 hares with an average weight of 5. 6 kg, at the age of reproductive maturity (adults: 11 - 12 months). Different muscle groups (the muscles Cervicalis, Intercostalis, Longissimus Dorsi, Psoas major, Triceps Brachi, Biceps femoris, Semimembranosus) and the main edible offal (heart, liver, kidney) were sampled. The ash was determined by calcination (in Supertherm C 311 oven calcination) at 5500 C. The results obtained were interpreted statistically (arithmetic mean (X), standard deviation (s), variance (s 2) and coefficient of variation (V%) and the statistical significance of differences was tested using the ANOVA Single Factor algorithm (p> 0. 05; p< 0. 01; p< 0. 001). Ash content for the main muscle groups analysed varied from the lowest average values of 1. 095 % for the Intercostalis muscles, to the highest average values of 1. 256 %, for Triceps brachii muscles...|$|E
