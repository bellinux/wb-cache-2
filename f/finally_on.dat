5|$|After {{coming to}} power in 2007, Mayawati wrote letters to the Prime Minister {{regarding}} partitioning of Uttar Pradesh into four different states in 2007, in March 2008 and December 2009. <b>Finally</b> <b>on</b> 15 November 2011, Mayawati's cabinet approved partitioning Uttar Pradesh into four different states (Pashchim Pradesh, Awadh Pradesh, Bundelkhand and Purvanchal) for better administration and governance.|$|E
5|$|Charles Darwin {{had been}} told that the Beagle was {{expected}} to sail about the end of September 1831, but fitting out took longer. The Admiralty Instructions were received on 14 November, and on 23 November she was moved to anchorage, ready to depart. Repeated Westerly gales caused delays, and forced them to turn back after departing on 10 and 21 December. Drunkenness at Christmas lost another day. <b>Finally,</b> <b>on</b> the morning of 27 December, the Beagle left its anchorage in the Barn Pool, under Mount Edgecumbe {{on the west side of}} Plymouth Sound and set out on its surveying expedition.|$|E
5|$|In 1799 the 49th was {{assigned}} to the Helder Expedition against the Batavian Republic (now known as the Netherlands), to be led by Sir Ralph Abercromby. During the troop landings, Brock saw his first combat on 10 September 1799 under the command of then-Major-General John Moore. Given that the 49th was in poor shape when Brock took command, they saw little actual combat. Likely Moore was sparing them and using more experienced troops to establish the beachhead. <b>Finally</b> <b>on</b> 2 October the 49th was actively involved in heavy combat at the Battle of Alkmaar, where they acquitted themselves well, sustaining only 33 deaths.|$|E

5|$|In June {{he joined}} No. 66 Squadron RFC at Aire, {{equipped}} with the Sopwith Pup. He undertook a refresher course but his tenure there was unremarkable. He was ordered to fly with the group rather than fly solo patrols. He flew 47 hours in 66 Squadron and 21 patrols. He encountered the enemy six times but could not score. <b>Finally</b> <b>on</b> 21 and 26 July he shot down one Albatros D.V fighter for his 6–7th aerial victories.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, Blue Demon, Jr., the {{president}} of NWA Mexico, sent letters to CMLL, telling them to stop promoting the NWA-branded championships since they {{were not part of}} the NWA. NWA Mexico had previously tried to reclaim the three NWA-branded championships promoted by CMLL, but was ignored by CMLL. The promotion did not directly respond to the latest claim either; the NWA Welterweight Champion, Mephisto, commented, simply stating that the titles belonged to CMLL. <b>Finally,</b> <b>on</b> August 12, 2010, CMLL debuted the new NWA World Historic Light Heavyweight Championship and returned the old title to NWA.|$|E
5|$|In early November 2007, Athens, Bangkok, Singapore, Moscow, and Turin were {{selected}} by the IOC as the five candidate cities to host the inaugural Youth Olympic Games.

5|$|Information {{from the}} sense organs is {{collected}} in the brain. There {{it is used to}} determine what actions the organism is to take. The brain processes the raw data to extract information about the structure of the environment. Next it combines the processed information with information about the current needs of the animal and with memory of past circumstances. <b>Finally,</b> <b>on</b> the basis of the results, it generates motor response patterns. These signal-processing tasks require intricate interplay between a variety of functional subsystems.|$|E
5|$|N600XL {{remained}} impounded at Cachimbo {{for almost}} three years, but in mid-2009 American company General Aviation Services agreed to buy the aircraft. The company partnered with Gantt Aviation and Constant Aviation to check and prepare it for its ferry to the US. Constant completed the work and <b>finally</b> <b>on</b> 19 November 2010 (more than 4 years after the accident) the aircraft, now with the new registration of N965LL, arrived at Cleveland International Airport to be refurbished and put up for sale.|$|E
5|$|On March 1, 2017, Hager {{announced}} on Chael Sonnen's podcast {{that he had}} requested his release from WWE.

5|$|Subsequent {{changes to}} US-412 {{have been more}} minor. On March 7, 1994, the highway was {{relocated}} near Chouteau. <b>Finally,</b> <b>on</b> October 4, 2004, the Transportation Commission approved the realignment of US-60, US-412, and SH-8 at their junction near Orienta. Other than routine maintenance, {{there have been no}} further changes to the highway since then.|$|E
5|$|After A Song to David, {{he tried}} to publish a {{collection}} of his Psalms translations, and Newbery sought to ruin him by hiring James Merrick to produce his own translations. Newbery then hired Smart's new publisher, James Fletcher, which in turn forced Smart {{to find a new}} publisher, delaying the printing of his Psalms. <b>Finally,</b> <b>on</b> 12 August 1765, he printed A Translation of the Psalms of David, which included Hymns and Spiritual Songs and a second edition of A Song to David. This work was criticised by Tobias Smollett who was working with Newbery at the time, and Newbery's edition by Merrick was constantly compared with Smart's. However, modern criticism has received Smart's version in a more favourable light. While working on this project, he was also working on a translation of the Phaedrus and a verse translation of Horace. His verse Horace was published in July 1767 including a preface in which he attacked Newbery, but the attack was in vain because Newbery died soon after.|$|E
50|$|He <b>finally,</b> died <b>on</b> January 23, 1985, at age 49.|$|R

5|$|After a {{short period}} of rest while Sattelberg was {{captured}} by the 26th Brigade, in late November the 2/15th joined the advance to Wareo, capturing Nongora village, crossing the Song River, and then undertaking patrols through the Christmas Hills until relieved by elements of the 4th Brigade, which pushed the Australian advance along the coast, forcing the Japanese north towards Sio as the Australians sought to secure the Huon Peninsula. In late December, the 20th Brigade rotated back into the lead, and the 2/15th took over from the 22nd Battalion around the Tunom River, where the battalion headquarters came under aerial attack. After a brief pause near the flood swollen Tunom, the advance continued throughout December and into January 1944 with minor skirmishes punctuating the battalion's advance. <b>Finally,</b> <b>on</b> 21 January, {{at the edge of the}} Sazomu River, the order arrived for the 2/15th to be withdrawn to Finschhafen for rest prior to repatriation to Australia. The fighting in New Guinea cost the battalion 30 killed in action, six dead from wounds, four dead from accidents and 119 wounded.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of the Berlin Wall in November 1989, many East Germans cut the coat of arms out of their flags, as Hungarians had done in 1956 and as Romanians would soon do during {{the fall of}} Ceaușescu. The {{widespread}} act of removing the coat of arms from the East German flag implied the plain black-red-gold tricolour as symbol for a united and democratic Germany. <b>Finally,</b> <b>on</b> 3 October 1990, as the area of the German Democratic Republic was absorbed into the Federal Republic of Germany, the black-red-gold tricolour became the flag of a reunified Germany. In 1998, the Foundation for the Reappraisal of the SED Dictatorship was formed. The duty of this organisation, directly responsible to the federal government, is to examine the consequences of the former East German regime. As its logo, the foundation used an East German flag with the Communist coat of arms cut out.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{intelligence}} acquired by a spy in Buell's army, Buckner advised Bragg that Buell was still ten miles from Louisville {{in the town}} of Mackville. He urged Bragg to engage Buell there before he reached Louisville, but Bragg declined. Buckner then asked Leonidas Polk to request that Bragg concentrate his forces and attack the Union army at Perryville, but again, Bragg refused. <b>Finally,</b> <b>on</b> October 8, 1862, Bragg's army—not yet concentrated with Kirby Smith's—engaged Maj. Gen. Alexander McCook's corps of Buell's army and began the Battle of Perryville. Buckner's division fought under General Hardee during this battle, achieving a significant breakthrough in the Confederate center, and reports from Hardee, Polk, and Bragg all praised Buckner's efforts. His gallantry was for naught, however, as Perryville ended in a tactical draw that was costly for both sides, causing Bragg to withdraw and abandon his invasion of Kentucky. Buckner joined many of his fellow generals in publicly denouncing Bragg's performance during the campaign.|$|E
