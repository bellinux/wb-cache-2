2500|$|Utilitarian-Pragmatic Argument: {{according}} to this rationale, a society that protects private property is more effective and prosperous than societies that do not.

By providing innovators with [...] "durable and tangible return on their <b>investment</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> labor, and other resources", intellectual property rights seek to maximize social utility. The presumption is that they promote public welfare by encouraging the [...] "creation, production, and distribution of intellectual works".

40|$|The sunk-cost effect, {{an irrational}} {{attention}} to non-recoverable past costs while making current decisions, {{has been documented}} widely {{in the domain of}} monetary costs. In this paper, I study the effect <b>of</b> past <b>time</b> <b>investments</b> on current decisions. In three experiments using choice situations, I demonstrate that the sunk-cost effect is not observed for past <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> <b>time,</b> but the effect reappears when the investments are expressed as monetary quantities. I further propose that this `pseudo-rationality' {{is due to the fact}} that individuals lack the ability to account for time in the same way as they account for money. In two additional experiments, I facilitate the accounting <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and show that the irrational sunk-cost effect reappears. In a final experiment, I test my propositions in a setting where subjects make real <b>investments</b> <b>of</b> <b>time</b> and subsequently make real choices.
