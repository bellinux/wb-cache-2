40|$|DMB‘s hand/wrist is so injured {{that she}} pays a young <b>fettler’s</b> wife {{to cook and}} launder for her, but ensures that no-one ever comes to her camp. She writes that the natives have all gone to Fowler’s Bay and the west coast for initiations, which ceremonies are now “mainly orgies”.

40|$|In {{a survey}} of health and {{environmental}} condi-tions in the Butterley Foundries (Keatinge and Potter, 1945) {{one of the principal}} health risks to which the workers were exposed was found to be pneumoconiosis, and it was estimated that the potential dust risk of <b>fettlers</b> was many times greater than that to which other workers in the foundries were exposed. Sixty foundry men, divided into broad occupational groups, five <b>fettlers,</b> 31 moulders, 24 others, were submitted to x-ray examination of the chest. Two out of the five <b>fettlers</b> examined were affected in comparison with only eight out of the 31 moulders. Since the publication of this survey a number of other inquiries have been made into the health of foundry workers and the environmental condition...|$|R

The word remains in common use in the North East and is synonymous in the area with the group.|$|E
50|$|Stevens {{was born}} Joyce Barnes on 6 January 1928 at Cullen Bullen, New South Wales near Lithgow, New South Wales, Australia. Her first {{home was a}} tin shed. Her mother had been a nurse, {{her father was a}} railway <b>fettler,</b> who moved from job to job.

5000|$|... 19 January 1917, a <b>fettler</b> {{was killed}} and another {{severely}} injured in the Woy Woy tunnel by a goods train. Prior to the tragedy the train had a minor accident inside the tunnel about 100 yards from the Woy Woy end. In order to get it out, the train had to be uncoupled {{in the middle and}} the engine proceeded to Woy Woy with {{the first half of the}} train. As the engine with the first half of the train went pass 3 fettlers and a ganger working just inside the tunnel on the down rails (those leading to Gosford) they merely regarded it as a complete train. When the engine returned from Woy Woy for the second half of trucks it ran back on the same line. The workers hearing the engine approach, travelling tender foremost showing no light, mistakenly thought they were stepping out of the way of a train heading in the opposite direction. Mr Julius Christiansen, of Woy Woy, was hurled forcibly against the wall of the tunnel and died almost instantly of head injuries. Mr James McKay, also of Woy Woy, was knocked down by Mr Christiansen's flight, and received slight injuries to the leg. The other <b>fettler</b> and the ganger escaped uninjured.|$|E
50|$|The Teesside <b>Fettlers</b> {{are one of}} {{the north}} east of England's longest running and most {{successful}} folk bands. They were first formed in the early 1960s and have seen many changes in their line up since. A considerable number of the cream of the North East's folk talent has at one time played with The Teesside <b>Fettlers,</b> including Vin Garbutt, Ron Angel, Richard Grainger, Bob Skingle and Adrian Beadnell. The band have performed across the UK, on the International circuit at festivals, concerts and on radio and television. They sing mainly about Teesside, North Yorkshire and Durham, telling the story of the development of the region, its industrial heritage and the beautiful countryside that surrounds it. Their audiences can always rely on an enjoyable experience of music, song and anecdotes. A regular request for the group is to provide Ceilidh evenings at which their resident caller, Ron Marshall joins them.|$|R
50|$|Einasleigh had a {{stationmaster}} until 1927 {{when the}} line was closed by flooding. After {{the line was}} reopened, a gatekeeper - probably a station mistress {{as it was in}} later years - was appointed as from 1928. After a new house was built in the 1970s, maintenance <b>fettlers</b> occupied this house. The line is now chiefly a tourist attraction known as the Gulflander.|$|R
5000|$|Raw {{castings}} often contain irregularities {{caused by}} seams and imperfections in the molds, {{as well as}} access ports for pouring material into the molds. [...] The process of cutting, grinding, shaving or sanding away these unwanted bits is called [...] "fettling". In modern times robotic processes {{have been developed to}} perform some of the more repetitive parts of the fettling process, but historically <b>fettlers</b> carried out this arduous work manually, [...] and often in conditions dangerous to their health.|$|R
50|$|Ootha Post Office {{opened on}} 15 December 1914 and closed in 1980. The primary school opened in 1933 and drew attendances from single digit numbers {{to the high}} twenties {{over the course of}} its life. The school was a single-teacher school {{throughout}} its life. One of those teachers was Eric Woodward, who {{went on to become the}} Minister for Education in the NSW government. Many of the pupils who passed through the school were the children of a transient <b>fettler</b> population whose main purpose was the maintenance of the railway line.|$|E
50|$|Skelton {{was born}} in Boggabri, New South Wales, ninth child of a railway <b>fettler,</b> educated at Boggabri Public School and brought up as a strict Protestant.

He received only a rudimentary education before working as a rural labourer and railway <b>fettler.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{heat and}} flies in April are still causing DMB {{discomfort}} and her water supply {{had been cut}} off in August without warning. The butcherbird has eaten most of the wrens so she communes with the stars during the long periods of wakefulness at night. She refuses {{to communicate with the}} nearby <b>fettlers</b> because they are all “unionists”. She expresses her thanks always for newspapers, magazines and books sent to her by Kilmeny, and says that she passes them all onto the nearest troop settlements...|$|R
50|$|The show format was {{a series}} of pastiches, closely edited to run without gaps, ranging from a big band show from the 1950s to a period Charles Dickens saga. There was also a tale about an archetypal {{northern}} brass band ("The General <b>Fettlers,</b> Warp and Weft Adjusters' Band"), a documentary about a wannabe star bingo-caller on a cruise liner and a portrayal of the Women's Institutes in the guise of an American emergency hospital drama. The show ended with a musical finale extravaganza based around Ann Widdecombe.|$|R
50|$|Garden beds {{with stone}} {{terracing}} and beds with retaining walls of stone, timber or concrete occur {{on both sides}} of the railway. In a garden bed below the <b>Fettler's</b> Quarters, large white stones set into concrete form the words: Spring Bluff. A mixture of exotic and native trees and shrubs are scattered among the site. Prominent plantings include a large clump of bamboo next to the station building and a nearby London Plane tree (platanus acerifolia) (1870) with a commemorative plaque at its base.|$|R
50|$|On Sunday 22 April 1883, the {{original}} wooden station house {{was destroyed by}} fire. A coroner's inquest failed to find a cause of the fire despite hearing evidence from many witnesses. Special praise {{was given to the}} young <b>fettler,</b> William Nettleton who bravely risked injury to save three chairs. Just over a month later Binalong was celebrating the completion of the brickwork of the new sturdier station. George Reynolds, the bricklayer, was toasted by the attendees for his work. The celebratory atmosphere also saw toasts to the Queen, the district engineer, the inspector, the carpenters, the Press and the station master and his wife; Mr and Mrs Rae.|$|E

50|$|Rufford {{lies on the}} A59 road linking it with Southport, Ormskirk, Preston and Liverpool. The nearest {{motorway}} is the M6 at Parbold. The Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway constructed {{its line}} through the village between 1847 and 1849, and Rufford railway station opened on 2 April 1849. The Rufford Branch of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal runs through the village {{to the east of}} Rufford Old Hall and there are two marinas, <b>Fettlers</b> Wharf and St Mary's which provide moorings. St Mary's Marina has a dry dock for repairs.|$|R
2500|$|Track needs regular {{maintenance}} {{to remain}} in good order, especially when high-speed trains are involved. Inadequate maintenance {{may lead to a}} [...] "slow order" [...] (North American terminology, or Temporary speed restriction in the United Kingdom) being imposed to avoid accidents (see Slow zone). Track maintenance was at one time hard manual labour, requiring teams of labourers, or trackmen (US: gandy dancers; UK: platelayers; Australia: <b>fettlers),</b> who used lining bars to correct irregularities in horizontal alignment (line) of the track, and tamping and jacks to correct vertical irregularities (surface). Currently, maintenance is facilitated by a variety of specialised machines.|$|R
50|$|Other removed {{features}} include {{an array of}} sidings and a crane {{on the eastern side}} of the line for loading agricultural produce and storing wagons, and a lamp room. Cattle, pig and sheep yards on the west side of the line were removed in 1977. A 1988 plan of the railway complex at Cooroy shows an inspector's house, inspector's hut, and <b>fettler's</b> hut to the west of the line, south of the road bridge, and an assistant station master's house north of the bridge. Most of these buildings were sold and removed in the 1980s and 1990s.|$|R

She enlisted as a nursing VAD (Voluntary Aid Detachment) during the Second World War, serving from 17 March 1943 to 14 July 1944. Later, she was the first female to be {{articled}} as a radio officer when she worked on an Australian merchant ship from 1954-1960.

5000|$|Mabo {{worked on}} {{pearling}} boats, as a cane cutter, {{and as a}} railway <b>fettler</b> before becoming a gardener at James Cook University in Townsville, Queensland {{at the age of}} 31. The time he spent on the campus had a massive impact on his life. In 1974, he was talking with JCU historians Noel Loos and Henry Reynolds, and Loos recalls:we were having lunch one day in Reynolds' office when Koiki was just speaking about his land back on Mer, or Murray Island. Henry and I realised that in his mind he thought he owned that land, so we sort of glanced at each other, and then had the difficult responsibility of telling him that he didn't own that land, and that it was Crown land. Koiki was surprised, shocked and even ... he said and I remember him saying 'No way, it's not theirs, it's ours.' ...|$|E

50|$|The <b>Fettler's</b> Quarters {{is a small}} {{rectangular}} timber structure sheltered by a gabled roof clad in corrugated iron. The building faces south-east, is clad {{with a mixture of}} weatherboards and chamferboards and stands on timber stumps, on a slightly sloping site. The main and rear elevations have centrally placed sash windows. Attached to the north-east of the earlier quarters is a more recent rectangular structure clad in corrugated iron, sheltered by a skillion roof. The main elevation has a timber door and a window with two sets of glass louvres. A similar window exists on the rear elevation of the building. A venting pipe projects from the roof.|$|R
50|$|By 1879, Spring Bluff station {{included}} a 7000-gallon gravity-fed supply of water, passenger station and office, porter's cottage and station master's residence. The existing station and night officer's quarters {{are thought to}} date from the 1880s. The crossing loop was extended in 1911 and 1959, with its current configuration dating from 1968. By 1963 the complex also {{included a}} signal cabin, single men's quarters (now removed), <b>fettler's</b> quarters, and loading bank. The station building contains two electric staff machines that demonstrate the safe management of multiple trains using the main range. No train driver was able to proceed between stations up or down the range without {{the issue of a}} staff. In 1992, Spring Bluff Station was decommissioned and Centralised Traffic Control (CTC) was installed.|$|R
