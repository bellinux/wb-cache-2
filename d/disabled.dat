40|$|Josefin Sundh, 1 Magnus Ekström 2 1 Department of Respiratory Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, Örebro University, Örebro, Sweden; 2 Department of Clinical Sciences, Division of Respiratory Medicine and Allergology, Lund University, Lund, Sweden Objective: To {{determine}} the prevalence, change in breathlessness status over time, and {{risk factors for}} <b>disabling</b> and persistent <b>disabling</b> breathlessness in relation to treatments in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD). Materials and methods: Longitudinal analysis of data from the Swedish National Register of COPD with breathlessness measured using modified Medical Research Council (mMRC) scores at two subsequent visits. Prevalence of <b>disabling</b> breathlessness (mMRC ≥ 2 at baseline) and persistent <b>disabling</b> breathlessness (<b>disabling</b> breathlessness at baseline and follow-up) was investigated in relation to COPD treatment. Risk factors for <b>disabling</b> breathlessness, change from non-disabling to <b>disabling</b> breathlessness, and persistent <b>disabling</b> breathlessness were analyzed using multiple logistic regression. Results: A total of 1, 689 patients were included in the study with a median follow-up of 12  months (interquartile range: 4 months). Prevalence of <b>disabling</b> breathlessness was 54 % at baseline. Persistent <b>disabling</b> breathlessness was present in 43 % of patients despite treatment and in 74 % of patients despite combined inhaled triple therapy and physiotherapy. Risk factors for <b>disabling</b> breathlessness or change to <b>disabling</b> breathlessness were higher age, lower lung function, frequent exacerbations, obesity, heart failure, depression, and hypoxic respiratory failure (all P< 0. 05). Persistent <b>disabling</b> breathlessness was associated with lower lung function and ischemic heart disease (all P< 0. 05). Conclusion: <b>Disabling</b> breathlessness is common in COPD despite treatment, which calls for improved symptomatic treatments and consideration of factors influencing <b>disabling</b> breathlessness. Factors influencing <b>disabling</b> breathlessness should be considered for COPD management. Keywords: COPD, breathlessness, dyspnea, longitudinal analysis, treatment, risk factor...|$|R

40|$|The {{study has}} focused on {{practicality}} of self-efficacy theory, and how it helps to build confidence among the <b>disables</b> in building their career choice as entrepreneurs. For this we chose a case study approach on <b>Disable’s</b> home, which is a non- profit organization to provide support for <b>disables.</b> The {{study was conducted in}} two phases. First phase, from <b>disable</b> people’s perspective who were trainees in the <b>Disable’s</b> home. And second, from the <b>Disable’s</b> home’s perspective. Findings of the first phase suggest, in order to sustain self-efficacy with regard to career choice as entrepreneurs, not only institutional support is enough but other additional supports like social, financial, family supports are important. In the second phase, it was observed that institution needs to be resourceful in order to provide proper support to the <b>disables</b> and embed self-efficacy among them...|$|R

To rehab, he made two appearances for the Double-A Frisco Roughriders and eight appearances for the Triple-A Round Rock Express. On July 8, he was transferred from the 15-day <b>disabled</b> list to the 60-day <b>disabled</b> list. He was outrighted to the minors on July 13. However, on July 14, after he cleared waivers, Feldman rejected the assignment giving the Rangers the option of activating him from the <b>disabled</b> list or releasing him.

40|$|This study {{tested and}} refined a {{framework}} that proposes a mechanism for retrieving alternative causes and <b>disabling</b> conditions (Cummins, 1995) during reasoning. Experiment I examined the relation between different factors affecting retrieval. The test revealed high correlations {{between the number of}} possible alternative causes or <b>disabling</b> conditions and their strength of association and plausibility. Experiment 2 explored the hypothesis that due to a more extended search process, conditional inferences would last longer when many alternative causes or <b>disabling</b> conditions were available. Affirmation of the consequent (AC) and modus ponens (NIP) latencies showed the hypothesized pattern. Denial of the antecedent (DA) and modus tollens (NIT) inferences did not show latency effects. The experiment also identified an effect of the number of <b>disabling</b> conditions on AC and DA acceptance. Experiment 3 measured efficiency of <b>disabler</b> retrieval by a limited time, <b>disabler</b> generation task. As predicted, better <b>disabler</b> retrieval was related to lower acceptance of the NIP and MT inferences. status: publishe...|$|R

Recent evidence indicates that besides the number of stored conditions, the relative strength of association of the alternative conditions with the consequent term is another important factor that affects the retrieval process. In this study we examined the effect of the strength of association for the <b>disabling</b> conditions. We identified causal conditionals for which there exists only one highly associated <b>disabler.</b> With these conditionals we constructed conditional inference problems in which the minor premise was expanded with the negation of a strongly or weakly associated <b>disabler.</b> Results indicate that strength of association of the <b>disabling</b> conditions is affecting reasoning performance: Acceptance of Modus Tollens increased when there was no strongly associated <b>disabler</b> available...|$|R
