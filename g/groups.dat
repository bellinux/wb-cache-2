5|$|A {{continuous}} map between two topological spaces induces a group homomorphism between the associated homotopy <b>groups.</b> In particular, if the map is a continuous bijection (a homeomorphism), {{so that the}} two spaces have the same topology, then their i-th homotopy <b>groups</b> are isomorphic for all i. However, the real plane has exactly the same homotopy <b>groups</b> as a solitary point (as does a Euclidean space of any dimension), and the real plane with a point removed has the same <b>groups</b> as a circle, so <b>groups</b> alone are not enough to distinguish spaces. Although the loss of discrimination power is unfortunate, it can also make certain computations easier.|$|E

5|$|<b>Groups</b> share a {{fundamental}} kinship {{with the notion}} of symmetry.

5|$|In a {{study done}} at Masoala Peninsula on red ruffed lemurs three levels of {{organization}} were identified and defined: communities, core <b>groups,</b> and subgroups. Communities are individuals that affiliated regularly with each other, but rarely with conspecifics outside of the community. Although the entire multi-male/multi-female community lives within a discrete home range, all individuals are never seen in the same location at the same time. Instead, individuals form dispersed social networks, known as core <b>groups,</b> within the community. Core <b>groups</b> are individuals that shared the same core area within a community territory throughout the year. Core <b>groups</b> typically consist of two reproductive females, as well as reproductive males and subadults, {{ranging in size from}} two individuals to nine. Females within the <b>groups</b> are cooperative, but male encounters are often agonistic. Subgroups, on the other hand, vary daily in size, composition, and duration, and consist of associated individuals from either the same core group or different core <b>groups,</b> depending on the season. It is from the consistent, daily changes in these subgroups that occur throughout the year, as well as the seasonal formations of core <b>groups</b> in core areas, that demonstrate the fission-fusion nature of ruffed lemur social structure.|$|E
5|$|In mathematics, {{particularly}} {{algebraic topology}} and homology theory, the Mayer–Vietoris sequence is an algebraic tool to help compute algebraic invariants of topological spaces, known as their homology and cohomology <b>groups.</b> The result {{is due to}} two Austrian mathematicians, Walther Mayer and Leopold Vietoris.
