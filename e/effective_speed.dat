40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the existing maintenance models of web offset presses, and to propose the method which increases the reliability of the printing press exploitation, but does not require big investments. Doctor motors allowed constant monitoring by measuring instruments, which allowed insight in current status of motors at any time, so they could be repaired or replaced before malfunction. The <b>effective</b> vibration <b>speed</b> (vRMS) was measured a few times during the year 2006. Standard ISO 2372 - 1974 (E) defines values and boundaries of the <b>effective</b> vibration <b>speed</b> (vRMS). Results of measuring <b>effective</b> vibration <b>speed</b> indicated the emersion of nuisance energy with deterioration. To determine the state of bearings, and check if they cause the increase of <b>effective</b> vibration <b>speed,</b> an envelope analysis- FFT of the acceleration specter is conducted.

500|$|The phase {{velocity}} {{is important in}} determining how a light wave travels through a material or from one material to another. It is often represented {{in terms of a}} refractive index. The refractive index of a material is defined as the ratio of c to the {{phase velocity}}vp in the material: larger indices of refraction indicate lower speeds. The refractive index of a material may depend on the light's frequency, intensity, polarization, or direction of propagation; in many cases, though, it can be treated as a material-dependent constant. The refractive index of air is approximately 1.0003. Denser media, such as water, glass, and diamond, have refractive indexes of around 1.3, 1.5 and 2.4, respectively, for visible light. In exotic materials like Bose–Einstein condensates near absolute zero, the <b>effective</b> <b>speed</b> of light may be only a few metres per second. However, this represents absorption and re-radiation delay between atoms, as do all slower-than-c speeds in material substances. As an extreme example of light [...] "slowing" [...] in matter, two independent teams of physicists claimed to bring light to a [...] "complete standstill" [...] by passing it through a Bose–Einstein condensate of the element rubidium, one team at Harvard University and the Rowland Institute for Science in Cambridge, Mass., and the other at the Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, also in Cambridge. However, the popular description of light being [...] "stopped" [...] in these experiments refers only to light being stored in the excited states of atoms, then re-emitted at an arbitrarily later time, as stimulated by a second laser pulse. During the time it had [...] "stopped," [...] it had ceased to be light. This type of behaviour is generally microscopically true of all transparent media which [...] "slow" [...] the speed of light.|$|E

The SLDRAM Consortium consisted of about 20 major DRAM and computer industry manufacturers. (The SLDRAM Consortium became incorporated as SLDRAM Inc. and then {{changed its name to}} Advanced Memory International, Inc.). SLDRAM was an open standard and did not require licensing fees. The specifications called for a 64-bit bus running at a 200, 300 or 400MHz clock frequency. This is achieved by all signals being on the same line and thereby avoiding the synchronization time of multiple lines. Like DDR SDRAM, SLDRAM uses a double-pumped bus, giving it an <b>effective</b> <b>speed</b> of 400, 600, or 800MT/s.|$|E

40|$|Preview {{wind speed}} {{measurements}} from a forward looking Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) system {{located in the}} hub of a wind turbine {{can be used by}} a feedforward blade pitch control system to mitigate structural loads. For individual blade pitch control, a separate preview estimate of the <b>effective</b> wind <b>speed</b> encountered by each blade must be available. One way of providing an estimate of the blade <b>effective</b> wind <b>speed</b> is to implement a hub mounted spinning lidar that scans the wind field at the rotational rate of the rotor such that the measured wind will reach the blade after some delay. In this way, both the lidar measurement and the wind turbine blade rotationally sample the wind field. The benefit gained by using preview wind speed measurements strongly depends on the correlation between the measured wind and the wind that interacts with the blades. In this research, the coherence between rotating lidar measurements and blade <b>effective</b> wind <b>speed</b> is calculated and analyzed using a spectral model of the wind field. The simulated wind field uses an isotropic von Karman spectrum and contains a model of wind evolution described by a longitudinal spatial coherence function. The coherence between stationary measurements and stationary blade <b>effective</b> wind <b>speeds</b> decreases to zero near the 1 P rotational frequency of the turbine. However, measurement coherence between rotating lidar measurements and blade <b>effective</b> wind <b>speed</b> remains much higher and does not decay until higher frequencies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The rotator of {{the wind}} turbine is subject to a spa-tially and {{temporally}} distributed wind field; the wind speed varies significantly at different points over the blades plane. This makes a direct measurement of <b>effective</b> wind <b>speed</b> impossible. We analyze the spectrums of the measurement of the anemometer and gener-ator power of a wind turbine, and {{point out that the}} characteristics of these two signals are complementary in the frequency domain. Then an observer for <b>effective</b> wind <b>speed</b> is proposed based on fre-quency-domain data fusion. The observer design is formulated as a mixed-sensitivity problem with linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Simulations were carried out to assess the performance under a realistic wind speed profile. The simulation results show that the observer can not only guarantee the static accuracy, but also im-prove the dynamic accuracy of the measurements of the effective wind.

Furthermore, by using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, we perform a global fitting for the unified dark fluid model from the type Ia supernova Union 2. 1, baryon acoustic oscillation and the full information of cosmic microwave background measurement given by the WMAP 7 -yr data points. The constrained results favor a small <b>effective</b> sound <b>speed.</b> Compared to the ΛCDM, it is found that the cosmic observations do not favor the phenomenon of fast transition for the unified dark fluid model.

40|$|In this paper, we {{continue}} to study a unified dark fluid model with a constant adiabatic sound speed but with the entropic perturbations. When the entropic perturbations are included, an <b>effective</b> sound <b>speed,</b> which reduces to the adiabatic sound speed when the entropic perturbations are zero, has to be specified as an additional free model parameter. Due to {{the relations between the}} adiabatic sound speed and equations of state (EoS) c^ 2 _s,ad(a) =w(a) -d(1 +w(a)) / 3 d a, the equation of state can be determined up to an integration constant in principle when an adiabatic sound speed is given. Then there are two degrees of freedom to describe the linear perturbations for a fluid. Its micro-scale properties are characterized by its EoS or adiabatic sound <b>speed</b> and an <b>effective</b> sound <b>speed.</b> We take the <b>effective</b> sound <b>speed</b> and adiabatic sound speed as free model parameters and then use the currently available cosmic observational data sets, which include type Ia supernova Union 2. 1, baryon acoustic oscillation and WMAP 7 -year data of cosmic background radiation, to constrain the possible entropic perturbations and the adiabatic sound speed via the Markov Chain Monte Carlo method.
