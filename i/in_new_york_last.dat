50|$|But that presupposition, as stated, is {{completely}} trivial, {{given what we}} know about New York. Several million people had dinner <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>last</b> night, and that in itself doesn't satisfy the presupposition of the sentence.

5000|$|Lenglen avenged {{the loss}} by {{defeating}} Mallory 6-2, 6-0 in 26 {{minutes in the}} 1922 Wimbledon final, the shortest final in a Grand Slam tournament on record. Lenglen reportedly said to Mallory after the match, [...] "Now, Mrs. Mallory, I have proved to you today what I {{could have done to}} you <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>last</b> year," [...] to which Mallory replied, [...] "Mlle. Lenglen, you have done to me today what I did to you <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>last</b> year; you have beaten me." [...] However, Kathleen McKane Godfree has said that Lenglen denied this exchange. Lenglen claimed that she merely said [...] "thank you" [...] to Mallory and coughed very suggestively behind an uplifted hand. This was to remind Mallory that she - Lenglen - had indeed had whooping cough in their New York match the previous year. The two played for the last time that summer in Nice, France with Lenglen winning 6-0, 6-0. This completed the head-to-head rivalry between the players, with Lenglen winning their first match at the 1921 World Hard Court Championships 6-3, 6-2, after which Mallory said about Lenglen, [...] "She is just the steadiest player that ever was. She just sent back at me whatever I sent at her and waited for me to make a fault. And her returns often enough were harder than the shots I sent up to her." ...|$|E

The movie was also selected {{as one of the}} 10 best films of 1980 by The Boston Globe, The Los Angeles Times and Time magazine, and last week it was nominated by the Writers Guild as best comedy written directly for the screen.

5000|$|However, {{this story}} was refuted by both Clapton and Baker, first by Clapton in a Times article from April 2006. The article stated that when asked about Cream, Clapton said: [...] "No. Not for me. We did {{it and it was}} fun. But life is too short. I've got lots of other things I would rather do, {{including}} staying at home with my kids. The thing about that band was that it was all to do with its limits ... it was an experiment." [...] In an interview in the UK magazine Music Mart, about the release of a DVD about the Blind Faith concert in Hyde Park 1969, Baker commented about his unwillingness to continue the Cream reunion. These comments were far more specific and explosive than Clapton's, as they were centred around his relationship with Jack Bruce. Ginger said, [...] "When he's Dr. Jekyll, he's fine ... It's when he's Mr. Hyde that he's not. And I'm afraid he's still the same. I tell you this - there won't ever be any more Cream gigs, because he did Mr. Hyde <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>last</b> year." ...|$|E
5000|$|A presupposition of a {{sentence}} must normally {{be part of the}} common ground of the utterance context (the shared knowledge of the interlocutors) in order for the sentence to be felicitous. Sometimes, however, sentences may carry presuppositions that {{are not part of the}} common ground and nevertheless be felicitous. For example, I can, upon being introduced to someone, out of the blue explain that my wife is a dentist, this without my addressee having ever heard, or having any reason to believe that I have a wife. In order to be able to interpret my utterance, the addressee must assume that I have a wife. This process of an addressee assuming that a presupposition is true, even in the absence of explicit information that it is, is usually called presupposition accommodation. We have just seen that presupposition triggers like my wife (definite descriptions) allow for such accommodation. In [...] "Presupposition and Anaphora: Remarks on the Formulation of the Projection Problem", the philosopher Saul Kripke noted that some presupposition triggers do not seem to permit such accommodation. An example of that is the presupposition trigger too. This word triggers the presupposition that, roughly, something parallel to what is stated has happened. For example, if pronounced with emphasis on John, the following sentence triggers the presupposition that somebody other than John had dinner <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>last</b> night.|$|E

5000|$|The {{publishing}} of “A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority” led to {{the arrest}} of five of its signers, known as the Boston Five, in early 1968. These were Michael Ferber, Dr. Benjamin Spock, William Sloan Coffin, Mitchell Goodman, and Marcus Raskin. [...] All five were members of RESIST. The indictment came on counts of “conspiring to ‘counsel, aid, and abet’ young men to refuse service in the armed forces and to refuse to have in their possession registration certificates and notices of classification.” [...] The claims were met with opposition from anti-war sympathizers, including the some odd 200 members of RESIST. The organization’s associate national director and professor of Humanities at M.I.T. Louis Kampf held a press conference to address the organization’s response to the indictments. He stated that Resist was considering calling a national academic strike, and that a statement in support of the Five was gathering signatures. The Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. {{was among the first to}} sign, “declaring that he too should go to jail if the five under indictment are sentenced.” [...] As reported in The Harvard Crimson:“According to the indictment, Coffin, Goodman, Raskin, and Dr. Spock agreed to sponsor a nationwide draft-resistance program that would include disrupting the induction processes at various induction centers, making public appeals for young men to resist the draft and to refuse to serve in the military services, and issuing calls for registrants to turn in their draft cards… Another [...] "overt act" [...] of the alleged conspiracy is the distribution <b>in</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>last</b> August by Coffin and Dr. Spock of a statement entitled [...] "A Call to Resist Illegitimate Authority."The aforementioned “nationwide draft-resistance program” is RESIST.|$|E
