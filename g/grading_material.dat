50|$|Work on {{the tunnel}} rapidly {{increased}} into {{the summer of}} 1942. Large areas of the rock were blasted away with controlled explosions, using dynamite. The material removed from the tunnel was used as <b>grading</b> <b>material</b> for {{other parts of the}} railway. Supplies were received behind schedule, mainly due to the war. This hindered progress on the tunnel. In June 1942, Japanese forces attacked and invaded the Alaskan islands of Attu and Kiska, again provoking the need to complete the tunnels sooner. The winter conditions of 1942 and 1943 slowed the progress of the tunnels. Work on the railroad continued until April 23, 1943, when the project was completed. Anton Anderson, the lead engineer for the tunnels and namesake for the tunnel to Whittier, was not present when the railroad was used for the first time, fearing the Whittier Tunnel was not ready.|$|E

There {{are much}} complex {{internal}} microstructures of functionally <b>graded</b> <b>materials,</b> and the mechanical parameters of functionally <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> structures varied {{with the space}} coordinates.

They are subject to mainly electrical stress more than mechanical or environmental stress. This paper investigates the potential use of non-linear <b>grading</b> <b>material</b> for optimising field distribution and the effectiveness in controlling the electric field stress on outdoor polymeric insulator. A two-dimensional (2 D) asymmetrical modelling based on 11 kV polymeric insulator system voltage was modelled using a commercially available Finite Element Method (FEM) package.

The fabrication process of this composite is done by mixing the insulating matrix with filler using high shear mixer, follow by degassing and curing. The additional procedure, heat treatment, is introduced to avoid the agglomeration risk. Such challenges during running this process are well discussed. The composites are subjected to three high voltage tests, alternating current (AC), direct current (DC) and impulse. The non-linearity behaviour of these composite is characterised as dependent on the microvaristor loading, material properties and voltage application.

This report presents two methods, which can be used for thermal stress analysis with known temperature distribution.

A literature survey was carried out to get general knowledge about mass concrete behavior, reasons for development of tensile strain in concrete and factors affecting the cracking of concrete due to temperature rise in concrete. It is learnt that tensile stresses that developed in two to three days after casting may be greater than tensile strain capacity of the concrete at that age and lead to crack.

In this study, two types of <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> have been considered: 1) continuous <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> 2) sandwich <b>graded</b> <b>materials.</b> For the first part, a transient analysis of a mixed mode dynamic crack in continuous <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> under thermo-mechanical loading was performed. Later, the effect of low and high temperature on the blast performance of sandwich <b>graded</b> <b>materials</b> was investigated. ^ Asymptotic analysis in conjunction with displacement potentials are used to develop thermo-mechanical stress fields for a mixed mode propagating crack in a continuous <b>graded</b> <b>material.</b> The crack is assumed to propagate at an angle with respect to the gradation direction. Asymptotic temperature field equations are derived for exponentially varying thermal properties, and these equations were then used to develop various temperature fields around the crack-tip. Later, these temperature fields were used in deriving thermo-mechanical stress fields. Using asymptotic thermo-mechanical stress fields, the effect of temperature field and transient parameters (loading rate, crack-tip acceleration, temperature change) on the contours of maximum principal stress and circumferential stress is discussed. Also, the effect of different temperature fields on the crack extension angle was studied. ^ High strain rate constitutive behavior of E-glass Vinyl ester composites and Corecell™ M 100 foam at different temperatures has been studied using SHPB apparatus. Eight different target temperatures were chosen: - 40 ºC, - 20 ºC, 0 ºC, 22 ºC, 40 ºC, 60 ºC, 80 ºC and 100 ºC. The sandwich composites were maintained at the target temperature before being subjected to shock-wave loading using a shock-tube. A high-speed photography system utilizing Digital Image Correlation (DIC) was used to record the real time deformation of the specimen. The results show a significant decrease in flow stress with the increase in the temperature of the core material. Significant fiber-matrix delamination was observed in face-sheets at elevated temperatures with little change in the value of compression modulus. For the low temperature environment, the core material shows brittle behavior resulting in core-cracking of the sandwich specimen under blast loading. ...|$|R

For NOR study, 3 -µm-thick sections were stained with 50 % aqueous silver nitrate solution. The predominant microscopic pattern of NORs was determined. Quantitative analyses of NORs were obtained of all cells present on each histological field using a 0. 025 mm² eyepiece graticule. Different histological fields were analyzed until the total number of NORs was 120 cells for each tumor. Kruskall-Wallis test was applied to compare the groups of sample data at a significance level of p= 0. 05. RESULTS: The mean number of AgNORs per nucleus was 3. 20 for the well-differentiated group, 5. 33 for the moderately differentiated one, 8. 27 for the poorly differentiated one, and 10. 08 for the undifferentiated one. AgNOR count was significantly different (p< 0. 05) among all of the studied groups.

The preliminary work has involved a comprehensive literature survey, followed by extensive computational modelling and simulation studies as well as laboratory works covering experimental investigations and fabrication of insulator prototypes. The literature survey reviewed stress-induced degradations as the cause of ageing and insulation failures, the determination of electric field distributions, considerations for outdoor insulator modelling, and field-optimisation techniques for achieving stress relief. An 11 kV polymeric insulator has been modelled and simulated under dry-clean and wet-polluted surface conditions in order to obtain electric field distribution along the insulator creepage path. The critical high field regions on polymeric surfaces were identified. In addition, clean fog solid layer tests were carried out to experimentally examine dry band formation and electric discharges. Experimental investigations confirmed the results previously achieved from theoretical simulations. A non-linear pollution model has been developed for simulating polluted outdoor insulators. The field-dependent conductivity was derived from layer conductance measurements in a non-standard low voltage test. The proposed model was used to simulate insulators under fog and light rain conditions which respectively represent a uniform and non-uniform wetting action in practice. It was demonstrated that the nonlinear pollution model yields a more detailed and realistic field distribution compared with results obtained with models using constant/linear conductivity. Short-length microvaristor coating, having a cone-shaped structure, was introduced at both insulator ends for controlling high field, particularly near the high voltage and ground terminals. The performance of field grading was evaluated through a number of simulation scenarios. The introduction of microvaristor material with an appropriate switching characteristic has led to a substantial improvement in the electric field and heat distributions along the insulator profile. The prototype of an 11 kV insulator with microvaristor <b>grading</b> <b>material</b> was fabricated in-house for preliminary tests. Lightning impulse (1. 2 / 50 μs) flashover tests were carried out using the ‘up and down’ method, and the flashover voltage was estimated by the 50 % probability breakdown, U 50. The results of the lightning impulse test have indicated a considerable increase in the flashover voltage up to 21 % when using microvaristor-graded insulator. Favourable field distributions obtained in the simulation study have indicated a strong correlation with the experimental results. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
