40|$|In {{this paper}} we explore {{the effects of a}} <b>diagonal</b> <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> as the EU’s Common Commercial Policy (CCP) {{incentive}} mechanism that affects the intraregional trade and transaction cost structure of firms engaged in cross-border business operation. The research explores how firms should frame their crossborder physical flows of goods and the configuration of their value-adding processes for taking advantage of <b>diagonal</b> <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> The empirical analysis is based on an in-depth case study of effects of the ‘SAP+ diagonal cumulation of origin’ on changes in the transaction cost structure of a selected Slovenian firm operating within the household-appliance sector in one of the Western Balkan Countries. Based on eligibility of local subsidiary for using origin of goods in its import/export transactions the cost calculations were made for its products and then three different business scenarios were developed for showing the effects of the mechanism on transaction cost changes of a firm. The paper concludes that, at the conceptual level, the mechanism of diagonal cumulation oforigin may serve as an effective institutional cross-border trade-promoting too...|$|E
40|$|In the {{emerging}} process of market globalisation, firms’ strategic options for optimising their cross-border operations have broadened. This paper presents a strategic framework for developing an appropriate strategic response of firms by relocating their production facilities and framing their operational procedures {{in such a}} way that they may, as eligible beneficiaries, exploit institutional incentive mechanisms available in a specific region or a host country. More specifically, in the paper we explore a strategic option for lowering firms’ operational costs through international operations by using the mechanism of <b>diagonal</b> <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> introduced by the European Union (EU) in its Common Commercial Policy towards selected non-member countries. Despite extensive discussions in theoretical literature on the conception of the rules of origin, only a few studies have explored the implications of this mechanism from the perspective of a firm’s transaction costs in international business. This paper shows that the ‘SAP+ diagonal cumulation of origin,’ when properly conceived and implemented by a firm, can positively affect its financial performance. By analysing the cost-effect simulation of a selected household appliance producer in the presented case study, we then discuss the key strategic and operational implications for firms wishing to take advantage of offered supranational institutional incentive mechanisms...|$|E

40|$|This is an {{empirical}} paper seeking {{to identify the}} mode of Turkey's integration into global markets in general, and pan-European markets in particular, as revealed in its trade performance. The analysis provides empirical support to the following observations. First, thanks to steady expansion of trade in goods and services since the mid- 1980 s, Turkey has become highly integrated into the world economy. Second, Turkey's export performance in 1996 - 2004 in EU markets bears strong similaritiesto the aggregate performance of new EU members from Central Europe (EU- 8). Similarities include dynamics, similar factors responsible for the increased presence in EU markets, factor content, and the role of"producer-driven"network trade. Turkey, together with Hungary, the Czech Republic, the Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Estonia, and Poland, stands {{as one of the}} top performers in"producer-driven"network trade indicating participation in a new global division of labor based on production fragmentation. The available evidence suggests an economic success story in the making. Export expansion owes a lot to improved policy environment and domestic liberalization. It is rather telling that the recent expansion has coincided with the implementation of most of the provisions of the EU-Turkey Customs Union Agreement, the completion of the removal of tariffs on trade in industrial products among pan-European parties to the Pan European <b>Cumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>Origin</b> Agreement, and improved macroeconomic stability after the 2001 crisis.

In short, our estimates do not suffer from biases from time-variant elements and country pair-specific elements.

40|$|Internationally {{fragmented}} {{production processes}} have highlighted {{the need of}} efficient sourcing from foreign suppliers. This paper aims to investigate how exports of final goods are affected by better access to foreign intermediate inputs. In particular, the paper empirically tests whether expanding the set of available intermediate input suppliers through preferential rules <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> liberalisation affects exports of final goods. We exploit {{the introduction of the}} southern Mediterranean countries into the Pan-Euro-Med zone <b>of</b> <b>diagonal</b> <b>cumulation</b> which meant that foreign intermediate inputs could be used from more countries than before without jeopardising the preferential access to the EU. Using a fixed effects specification that controls for detailed levels of unobserved heterogeneity and multilateral resistance, we examine the effect <b>of</b> the new <b>diagonal</b> <b>cumulation</b> possibilities on southern Mediterranean exports to EU- 15. We find a positive effect on both export intensity, the value of exports, and export diversification, the number of exported products.

In particular, we consider {{the impact of}} switching from bilateral to <b>diagonal</b> <b>cumulation</b> when using preferences (instead of paying the MFN tariff) involving the respect <b>of</b> rules <b>of</b> <b>origin.</b> We find that relaxing the restrictiveness of the ROOs leads the least productive exporters to stop exporting. The empirical part confirms these results. We use the most recent techniques developed by Helpman, Melitz and Rubinstein (2007) on highly disaggregated data (HS 6 digit) to analyse {{the effects of the}} introduction <b>of</b> the Pan-European <b>Cumulation</b> System (PECS).

40|$|The {{entry into}} force of the Additional Protocol of the Framework Agreement of the Pacific Alliance in May 2016 marked an {{important}} step towards the regional integration efforts of its four members: Chile, Colombia, Mexico and Peru. In addition to promoting trade and investment linkages among its members, a core objective of the Pacific Alliance —and what distinguishes it from other regional integration efforts in Latin America— is {{to serve as a}} platform for economic and commercial integration between Latin America and Asia-Pacific. It is, therefore, of particular interest to evaluate current economic developments taking part in modern Latin America and their impact upon these integration efforts. The data of bilateral flows of trade in goods at the product and sector level, together with the study of trade in services as well as foreign direct investment, reflect the strong links within the Pacific Alliance. It also reveals the potential to further increase its members’ participation in regional and global value chains. The Additional Protocol will serve not only to immediately eliminate tariffs for nearly 95 % of intraregional imports, but also to foster economic integration through <b>cumulation</b> <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> and trade facilitation. The Pacific Alliance faces several challenges in the medium-term. First, it must successfully incorporate Costa Rica as a full member, the first accession since the Pacific Alliance was formed.

The rules thus are there to preserve the existing external protection of countries within the PTA.

This paper provides the first serious empirical examination of the possible impact <b>of</b> rules <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> on patterns <b>of</b> trade in the European context.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to provide a detailed mapping of the different rules <b>of</b> <b>origin</b> regimes in FTAs in Europe and the Americas, and to draw lessons from these regimes to the EU-Mercosur RoO negotiations, in particular. The paper offers four recommendations. First, the EU¿s standardized RoO regime will play a central role in the EU-Mercosur RoO negotiations. However, there is plenty of room for mutual tariff concessions. At the minimum, the EU¿s tariff preferences for Mercosur should approximate those provided to Chile in order to foster Mercosur¿s chances to augment its industrial exports to the European market. Second, the EU-Mercosur FTA RoO regime should incorporate general and sector-specific adjustment mechanisms in order to enable Mercosur to better utilize the preferential treatment provided by the EU. Third, Mercosur will need to further consolidate its common market in order to take full advantage of the RoO regime¿s likely provision <b>of</b> <b>diagonal</b> <b>cumulation.</b> Fourth, Mercosur should make the most of its strategy of simultaneous trade negotiations in the Americas and with the EU by ensuring a high degree of compatibility between its two major future agreements...|$|R
