5|$|In {{explaining}} {{this separation}} of species, Rasmussen points to morphological divergence and {{significant differences in}} vocalization. Ornithologist Edward C. Dickinson observed in a 2006 article that though evidence of morphological and vocal differences between S. przewalskii and S. leucopsis have been delineated, little had yet been published presenting comparative morphological details, {{and that it would}} be <b>instructive</b> to study how each taxon responds to the calls of the other.|$|E
25|$|In the Petites Heures Berry pays {{homage to}} his parents, Jean the Good and Bonne of Luxembourg, through <b>instructive</b> prayers and texts copied from their {{respective}} books.|$|E
25|$|Since {{wood and}} {{textiles}} have decomposed, the best-preserved (and most <b>instructive)</b> surviving examples of Minoan art are its pottery, palace architecture (with frescos which include landscapes), stone carvings and intricately-carved seal stones.|$|E
25|$|Despite their similarities, the two sports {{also have}} many {{differences}} in play and in strategy. A comparison between baseball and cricket can be <b>instructive</b> to followers of either sport, since the similarities help to highlight nuances particular to each game.|$|E
25|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{political}} entities across the world use an eagle in their official emblems. The variation among them is <b>instructive,</b> in that it reflects connections among various heraldic traditions. The following is just a sampling of these.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, a {{comparison}} of other fission-to-fusion timespans may be <b>instructive.</b> The time between the U.S.'s first atomic test and its first hydrogen bomb test was 86 months, for the USSR it was 75 months, for the UK 66 months and later for France, 105 months.|$|E
25|$|Peychinovich's second book, Utesheniе Greshnim ("Solace of the sinner"), {{much like}} his {{first one is}} a Christian {{collection}} of instructions— including advice on how weddings should be organized and how those who had sinned should be consoled, {{as well as a}} number of <b>instructive</b> tales.|$|E
25|$|Information in the {{anterior}} forebrain pathway is projected from HVC to Area X (basal ganglia), then from Area X to the DLM (thalamus), and from DLM to LMAN, which then links the vocal learning and vocal production pathways through connections {{back to the}} RA. Some investigators have posited a model in which the connection between LMAN and RA carries an <b>instructive</b> signal based on evaluation of auditory feedback (comparing the bird's own song to the memorized song template), which adaptively alters the motor program for song output. The generation of this <b>instructive</b> signal could be facilitated by auditory neurons in Area X and LMAN that show selectivity for the temporal qualities of the bird's own song (BOS) and its tutor song, providing a platform for comparing the BOS and the memorized tutor song.|$|E
25|$|Dungy {{stresses}} that coaches are essentially teachers who put faith and family ahead of football {{and do not}} belittle their players or scream at them. Also, like Dungy, they remain calm when things go badly. They guide instead of goad, and Lovie Smith found that perhaps the most <b>instructive</b> thing of all.|$|E
25|$|Maryland's 24 {{public library}} systems deliver public {{education}} {{for everyone in}} the state of Maryland through a curriculum that comprises three pillars: Self-Directed Education (books and materials in all formats, e-resources), Research Assistance & Instruction (individualized research assistance, classes for students of all ages), and <b>Instructive</b> & Enlightening Experiences (e.g., Summer Reading Clubs, author events).|$|E
25|$|In gliogenesis, Notch {{appears to}} have an <b>instructive</b> role that can {{directly}} promote the differentiation of many glial cell subtypes. For example, activation of Notch signaling in the retina favors the generation of Muller glia cells {{at the expense of}} neurons, whereas reduced Notch signaling induces production of ganglion cells, causing a {{reduction in the number of}} Muller glia.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the definition of territory, it is <b>instructive</b> to apply it first to a position of a kind that might arise before the end of a game. Let us assume that a game has ended in the position below (even though it would not normally occur as a final position between skilled players).|$|E
25|$|The {{life of the}} Algerian Sufi master Abdelkader El Djezairi is <b>instructive</b> in this regard. Notable as {{well are}} the lives of Amadou Bamba and El Hadj Umar Tall in West Africa, and Sheikh Mansur and Imam Shamil in the Caucasus. In the twentieth century, some Muslims have called Sufism a superstitious {{religion}} that holds back Islamic achievement {{in the fields of}} science and technology.|$|E
25|$|According to New Testament scholar Dr. Frank Stagg and classicist Evelyn Stagg, the {{synoptic}} Gospels of {{the canonical}} New Testament contain {{a relatively high}} number of references to women. The Staggs find no recorded instance where Jesus disgraces, belittles, reproaches, or stereotypes a woman. These writers claim that examples of the manner of Jesus are <b>instructive</b> for inferring his attitudes toward women and show repeatedly how he liberated and affirmed women.|$|E
25|$|Highly <b>instructive</b> but of {{far less}} {{industrial}} significance is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene (and many other aromatic rings) using an alkyl halide {{in the presence}} of a strong Lewis acid catalyst. Similarly, the Friedel-Crafts acylation is a related example of electrophilic aromatic substitution. The reaction involves the acylation of benzene (or many other aromatic rings) with an acyl chloride using a strong Lewis acid catalyst such as aluminium chloride or Iron(III) chloride.|$|E
25|$|The chuánqí of the Tang period {{frequently}} use incidental poems, {{set their}} {{story in the}} national capital, finish with an <b>instructive</b> moral, and are narrated by someone {{who claims to have}} seen the events himself. One of the most widely read of these stories was Yuan Zhen's Story of Yingying, concerning the romance of a young scholar and an alluring young lady. This story helped to establish the genre of Caizi jiaren (Scholar and beautiful lady).|$|E
25|$|The {{group of}} ecclesiastical remains at Ardfert {{is one of}} the most {{interesting}} and <b>instructive</b> now existing in Ireland. The ruins of the ancient Cathedral of St Brendan, and of its annexed chantries and detached chapels, form a very complete reliquary of Irish ecclesiastical architecture, in its various orders and ages, from the plain but solid Danhliag of the seventh or eighth century to some late and most ornate examples of medieval Gothic. The cathedral, as it now stands, or rather as it stood before it was finally dismantled in A.D. 1641.|$|E
25|$|With these {{limitations}} in mind, fitness landscapes {{can still be}} an <b>instructive</b> {{way of thinking about}} evolution. It is fundamentally possible to measure (even if not to visualise) some of the parameters of landscape ruggedness and of peak number, height, separation, and clustering. Simplified 3D landscapes can then be used relative to each other to visually represent the relevant features. Additionally, fitness landscapes of small subsets of evolutionary pathways may be experimentally constructed and visualized, potentially revealing features such as fitness peaks and valleys. Fitness landscapes of evolutionary pathways indicate the probable evolutionary steps and endpoints among sets of individual mutations.|$|E
25|$|Grantham's local newspaper, , {{first went}} on sale in 1854 as The Grantham Journal of Useful, <b>Instructive</b> and Entertaining Knowledge and Monthly Advertiser, which was {{shortened}} to its current name a few years later. It was founded by Henry Escritt, a Yorkshire man by birth {{who moved to the}} area in 1861. The 'Journal' is owned by Iliffe Media (formerly by Johnston Press), and has a sister newspaper in Melton Mowbray, the Melton Times. In the 1960s and earlier it produced the Melton Journal and Rutland Journal, both versions of the main paper. It also produces a Bingham edition.|$|E
25|$|In 1639, he was arrested. His {{books were}} confiscated. The authorities, hardly giving Quevedo {{time to get}} dressed, took the poet to the convent of San Marcos in León. In the monastery Quevedo {{dedicated}} himself to reading, as recounted in his Carta moral e instructiva (Moral and <b>instructive</b> letter), written to his friend, Adán de la Parra, depicting hour by hour his prison life ("From ten to eleven, I spend my time in prayer and devotions, and from eleven to noon I read good and bad authors; {{because there is no}} book, despicable as it can be, that does not contain something good...").|$|E
25|$|Simply {{examining}} {{the performance of}} the best known value investors would not be <b>instructive,</b> because investors do not become well known unless they are successful. This introduces a selection bias. A better way to investigate the performance of a group of value investors was suggested by Warren Buffett, in his May 17, 1984 speech that was published as The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville. In this speech, Buffett examined the performance of those investors who worked at Graham-Newman Corporation and were thus most influenced by Benjamin Graham. Buffett's conclusion is identical to that of the academic research on simple value investing strategies—value investing is, on average, successful in the long run.|$|E
25|$|Within a {{death toll}} {{often viewed as}} ranging between as low as five and as high as seven million, Hilberg's own {{detailed}} breakdown in The Destruction reveals a total estimated death toll of 5.1 million Jews. Only for the death toll at Belzec does Hilberg provide a precise figure, all the others are rounded. When these rounding factors {{are taken into account}} a range of 4.9 million to 5.4 million deaths emerges. It is <b>instructive</b> to note that the discrepancy in total figures among Holocaust researchers is often overshadowed by that between Soviet and Western scholarship. One striking example {{can be seen in the}} Auschwitz State Museum's significant reduction of the estimated death toll in Auschwitz.|$|E
25|$|Earth {{environments that}} cannot support life are still <b>instructive</b> to astrobiologists in {{defining}} the limits of what organisms can endure. The heart of the Atacama desert, generally considered the driest place on Earth, appears unable to support life, {{and it has been}} subject to study by NASA and ESA for that reason: it provides a Mars analog and the moisture gradients along its edges are ideal for studying the boundary between sterility and habitability. The Atacama was the subject of study in 2003 that partly replicated experiments from the Viking landings on Mars in the 1970s; no DNA could be recovered from two soil samples, and incubation experiments were also negative for biosignatures.|$|E
25|$|He wrote {{three books}} on chess strategy: Mein System (My System), 1925, Die Praxis meines Systems (The Practice of My System), 1929, {{commonly}} known as Chess Praxis, and Die Blockade (The Blockade), 1925, though much in the latter book is generally held to be a rehash of material already presented in Mein System. Mein System {{is considered to be}} one of the most influential chess books of all time. It sets out Nimzowitsch's most important ideas, while his second most influential work, Chess Praxis, elaborates upon these ideas, adds a few new ones, and has immense value as a stimulating collection of Nimzowitsch's own games accompanied by his idiosyncratic, hyperbolic commentary which is often as entertaining as <b>instructive.</b>|$|E
25|$|Later, Reese {{made use}} of the growing library of hands from {{international}} competitions to create interesting quiz-type books, where the discussion was usually on the verso of the page which presented the problem. Famous Hands from Famous Matches {{was the first of}} these, followed by Famous Bidding Decisions and Famous Play Decisions, all written with David Bird. In his career as a writer, Reese had a number of co-authors, mostly highly competent players and writers, yet all his books were in his inimitable style. Another of his ideas was to raid the stock of hands in bridge magazine bidding competitions for interesting and <b>instructive</b> hands. What Would You Bid? was the result.|$|E
25|$|Hasse {{diagrams}} can visually {{represent the}} elements and relations of a partial ordering. These are graph drawings where the vertices are {{the elements of}} the poset and the ordering relation is indicated by both the edges and the relative positioning of the vertices. Orders are drawn bottom-up: if an element x is smaller than (precedes) y then there exists a path from x to y that is directed upwards. It is often necessary for the edges connecting elements to cross each other, but elements must never be located within an edge. An <b>instructive</b> exercise is to draw the Hasse diagram for the set of natural numbers that are smaller than or equal to 13, ordered by | (the divides relation).|$|E
25|$|Livy's account skirts the funereal, {{sacrificial}} {{function of}} early Roman gladiator combats and reflects the later theatrical ethos of the Roman gladiator show: splendidly, exotically armed and armoured barbarians, treacherous and degenerate, {{are dominated by}} Roman iron and native courage. His plain Romans virtuously dedicate the magnificent spoils of war to the Gods. Their Campanian allies stage a dinner entertainment using gladiators {{who may not be}} Samnites, but play the Samnite role. Other groups and tribes would join the cast list as Roman territories expanded. Most gladiators were armed and armoured in the manner of the enemies of Rome. The munus became a morally <b>instructive</b> form of historic enactment in which the only honourable option for the gladiator was to fight well, or else die well.|$|E
25|$|The formal {{definition}} of distributions exhibits {{them as a}} subspace {{of a very large}} space, namely the topological dual of D(U) (or S(Rd) for tempered distributions). It is not immediately clear from the definition how exotic a distribution might be. To answer this question, it is <b>instructive</b> to see distributions built up from a smaller space, namely the space of continuous functions. Roughly, any distribution is locally a (multiple) derivative of a continuous function. A precise version of this result, given below, holds for distributions of compact support, tempered distributions, and general distributions. Generally speaking, no proper subset of the space of distributions contains all continuous functions and is closed under differentiation. This says that distributions are not particularly exotic objects; they are only as complicated as necessary.|$|E
25|$|Brainard & Doupe (2000) posit a {{model in}} which LMAN (of the {{anterior}} forebrain) plays a primary role in error correction, as it detects differences between the song produced by the bird and its memorized song template and then sends an <b>instructive</b> error signal to structures in the vocal production pathway in order to correct or modify the motor program for song production. In their study, Brainard & Doupe (2000) showed that while deafening adult birds led {{to the loss of}} song stereotypy due to altered auditory feedback and non-adaptive modification of the motor program, lesioning LMAN in the anterior forebrain pathway of adult birds that had been deafened led to the stabilization of song (LMAN lesions in deafened birds prevented any further deterioration in syllable production and song structure).|$|E
25|$|<b>Instructive</b> for {{the study}} of the {{development}} of Jewish mysticism is the Book of Jubilees written around the time of King John Hyrcanus. It refers to mysterious writings of Jared, Cain, and Noah, and presents Abraham as the renewer, and Levi as the permanent guardian, of these ancient writings. It offers a cosmogony based upon the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet, and connected with Jewish chronology and Messianology, while at the same time insisting upon the heptad (7) as the holy number, rather than upon the decadic (10) system adopted by the later haggadists and observable in the Sefer Yetzirah. The Pythagorean idea of the creative powers of numbers and letters was shared with Sefer Yetzirah and was known in the time of the Mishnah before 200 CE.|$|E
25|$|Including songbooks, the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature lists almost 5000 verse miscellanies {{which were}} printed between 1701 and 1800. Due to {{the sheer number}} and variety of miscellanies printed in the 18th century, there are few generalizations {{that can be made}} about them. From the polite (Allan Ramsay’s The Tea-Table Miscellany, 1724–27) to the partly obscene (The Merry Thought: or, The Glass-Window and Bog-house Miscellany, 1731–33) the central purpose behind nearly all printed verse miscellanies was the reader’s entertainment. However, they were also marketed with {{practical}} purposes in mind: as educative moral guides (Miscellanies, Moral and <b>Instructive,</b> in Prose and Verse, 1787), as repositories of useful information (A Miscellany of Ingenious Thoughts and Reflections in Verse and Prose, 1721–30), as elocutionary aids (William Enfield’s The Speaker, 1774-1820), and as guides for poetical composition (Edward Bysshe's The Art of English Poetry, 1702–62).|$|E
25|$|Gurdjieff {{felt that}} the {{traditional}} methods of self-knowledge—those of the fakir, monk, and yogi (acquired, respectively, through pain, devotion, and study)—were inadequate {{on their own and}} often led to various forms of stagnation and one-sidedness. His methods were designed to augment the traditional paths with the purpose of hastening the developmental process. He sometimes called these methods The Way of the Sly Man because they constituted a sort of short-cut through a process of development that might otherwise carry on for years without substantive results. The teacher, possessing consciousness, sees the individual requirements of the disciple and sets tasks that he knows will result in a transformation of consciousness in that individual. <b>Instructive</b> historical parallels {{can be found in the}} annals of Zen Buddhism, where teachers employed a variety of methods (sometimes highly unorthodox) to bring about the arising of insight in the student.|$|E
25|$|The Tibetan Buddhism {{tradition}} emphasizes an <b>instructive</b> and devotional {{relationship to}} a guru; this may involve devotional practices known as guru yoga which are congruent with prayer. It also appears that Tibetan Buddhism posits {{the existence of}} various deities, but the peak view of the tradition is that the deities or yidam are no more existent or real than the continuity (Sanskrit: santana; refer mindstream) of the practitioner, environment and activity. But how practitioners engage yidam or tutelary deities will depend upon the level or more appropriately yana at which they are practicing. At one level, one may pray to a deity for protection or assistance, taking a more subordinate role. At another level, one may invoke the deity, on a more equal footing. And {{at a higher level}} one may deliberately cultivate the idea that one has become the deity, whilst remaining aware that its ultimate nature is śūnyatā. The views of the more esoteric yana are impenetrable for those without direct experience and empowerment.|$|E
25|$|The philosopher Robert Todd Carroll {{responded that}} Grinder has not {{understood}} Kuhn's {{text on the}} history and philosophy of science, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. Carroll replies: (a) individual scientists never have nor are they ever able to create paradigm shifts volitionally and Kuhn does not suggest otherwise; (b) Kuhn's text does not contain the idea that being unqualified {{in a field of}} science is a prerequisite to producing a result that necessitates a paradigm shift in that field and (c) The Structure of Scientific Revolutions is foremost a work of history and not an <b>instructive</b> text on creating paradigm shifts and such a text is not possible—extraordinary discovery is not a formulaic procedure. Carroll explains that a paradigm shift is not a planned activity, rather it is an outcome of scientific effort within the current (dominant) paradigm that produces data that can't be adequately accounted for within the current paradigm—hence a paradigm shift, i.e. the adoption of a new paradigm.|$|E
25|$|The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) has {{determined}} that coal tar creosote is probably carcinogenic to humans, based on adequate animal evidence and limited human evidence. It is <b>instructive</b> {{to note that the}} animal testing relied upon by IARC involved the continuous application of creosote to the shaved skin of rodents. After weeks of creosote application, the animals developed cancerous skin lesions and in one test, lesions of the lung. The United States Environmental Protection Agency has stated that coal tar creosote is a probable human carcinogen based on both human and animal studies. As a result, the Federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set a permissible exposure limit of 0.2 milligrams of coal tar creosote per cubic meter of air (0.2mg/m3) in the workplace during an 8-hour day, and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) requires that spills or accidental releases into the environment of one pound (0.454kg) or more of creosote be reported to them.|$|E
