5|$|The main {{threats to}} the park's {{biodiversity}} are wood extraction and forest clearing for agriculture and pastures. A large <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> rejection by some local inhabitants of the new park boundaries.|$|E
5|$|A related <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{inclusion}} {{of pregnant women}} in clinical studies. Since other illnesses can exist concurrently with pregnancy, information is needed on the response to and efficacy of interventions during pregnancy, but ethical issues relative to the fetus, make this more complex. This gender bias is partly offset by the iniation of large scale epidemiology studies of women, such as the Nurses' Health Study (1976), Women's Health Initiative and Black Women's Health Study.|$|E
50|$|WildBird {{has special}} issues every year about {{hummingbirds}} and raptors. In 2009, <b>the</b> May/June <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> 19th hummer <b>issue,</b> and <b>the</b> July/August <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> 17th {{birds of prey}} issue.

5|$|Another {{increasing}} <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> rise in conditional {{cash transfer}} programs in Latin America, such as the Oportunidades program in Mexico. Although this program is meant to provide poor families {{with an increase in}} income, the conditionalities has led to a time poverty for the family members who are in charge of fulfilling the conditions, most oftentimes the woman. This has increased the inequality of work burden within the family.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> role of {{inherited}} genetic {{factors in}} shaping attachments: for example {{one type of}} polymorphism of the gene coding for the D2 dopamine receptor {{has been linked to}} anxious attachment and another in the gene for the 5-HT2A serotonin receptor with avoidant attachment. This suggests that the influence of maternal care on attachment security is not the same for all children. One theoretical basis for this is that it makes biological sense for children to vary in their susceptibility to rearing influence.|$|E
5|$|Both {{subspecies}} of South Asian {{river dolphins}} {{have been very}} adversely affected by human use of the river systems in the subcontinent. Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies' ranges. Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also contributed to population decline. Perhaps the most significant <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> building of more than 50 dams along many rivers, causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed. Currently, three subpopulations of Indus river dolphins are considered capable of long-term survival if protected.|$|E
25|$|During {{this last}} phase of Byzantine coinage gold <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> {{discontinued}} {{and a regular}} silver <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> commenced. <b>The</b> denomination <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Stavraton <b>issued</b> in 1, a half, an eighth and a 16th of its value.

50|$|Each {{issue of}} the {{magazine}} had a theme that was typically associated with the calendar month. <b>The</b> December <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Holiday <b>issue,</b> while <b>the</b> January <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> Beginners <b>issue</b> and <b>was</b> meant as {{an introduction to the}} CoCo world for readers who had received a Color Computer for Christmas.

5|$|On {{appeal to}} the Court of Appeal, three issues were raised. The first issue was whether the plaintiffs (appellants) had the {{requisite}} locus standi. The second was whether {{there had been an}} inordinate delay on the appellants' part in pursuing the matter in court. The third <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> most significant, namely, whether the acquisition of the temple property violated Article 12(1) of the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|One major <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> West Lothian question, {{in which}} MPs from Scotland and Wales {{are able to}} vote on {{legislation}} affecting only England, while English MPs have no equivalent right to legislate on devolved matters. This when placed {{in the context of}} England being the only country of the United Kingdom not to have free cancer treatment, prescriptions, residential care for the elderly and free top-up university fees, has led to a steady rise in English nationalism. Some have suggested the creation of a devolved English parliament, while others have proposed simply limiting voting on legislation which only affects England to English MPs.|$|E
5|$|One point {{still at}} <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{position}} of Ch'olan and Q'anjobalan–Chujean. Some scholars think these form a separate Western branch (as in the diagram below). Other linguists {{do not support}} the positing of an especially close relationship between Ch'olan and Q'anjobalan–Chujean; consequently they classify these as two distinct branches emanating directly from the proto-language. An alternative proposed classification groups the Huastecan branch as springing from the Ch'olan-Tzeltalan node, rather than as an outlying branch springing directly from the proto-Mayan node.|$|E
50|$|Another legacy <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> German {{invasion}} of neighbouring South West Africa.|$|R

5|$|The United States naval gunfire support {{debate is}} an ongoing debate among the United States Navy, Marine Corps, Congress, and {{independent}} groups like the United States Naval Gunfire Support Association over what role naval gunfire support and naval surface fire support (NSFS) should play within the navy and how such a role can best be provided. At {{the heart of the}} <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> role that naval gunfire support—the use of naval artillery to provide fire support for amphibious assault and other troops operating within their range—should play in the U.S. Navy of the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|Another major <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{amount of}} {{radiation}} {{to which a}} space probe is subjected, due to the harsh charged-particle environment around Jupiter (for a detailed explanation see Magnetosphere of Jupiter). For example, when Pioneer 11 made its closest approach to the planet, the level of radiation was ten times more powerful than Pioneers designers had predicted, leading to fears that the probes would not survive. With a few minor glitches, the probe managed {{to pass through the}} radiation belts, but it lost most of the images of the moon Io, as the radiation had caused Pioneers imaging photo polarimeter to receive false commands. The subsequent and far more technologically advanced Voyager spacecraft had to be redesigned to cope with the radiation levels. Over the eight years the Galileo spacecraft orbited the planet, the probe's radiation dose far exceeded its design specifications, and its systems failed on several occasions. The spacecraft's gyroscopes often exhibited increased errors, and electrical arcs sometimes occurred between its rotating and non-rotating parts, causing it to enter safe mode, which led to total loss of the data from the 16th, 18th and 33rd orbits. The radiation also caused phase shifts in Galileos ultra-stable quartz oscillator.|$|E
5|$|The {{administration}} {{and management of}} the Vikos–Aoös National Park belongs to two district forest offices, supervised by a forest directorate at the prefecture level. Moreover, the office of World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) in the village of Papingo plays an essential role in management issues. Apart from government efforts, incentives have been given to local management organizations and the local population to participate in the protection of the park. In the park's core, according to the law, forestry activities, grazing, hunting, and fishing are prohibited. In the peripheral zone there are no such restrictions, but the Forest Service can take any necessary measure for the realization of the aims of the park. Apart from the above-mentioned activities, dangers to the park include land erosion, landslides, and wildfires which threaten the local flora and fauna. Another <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> impact of tourism in recent decades. On the other hand, extreme geophysical conditions make the construction and maintenance of the necessary infrastructure network, mainly access routes and telecommunications, difficult.|$|E
25|$|Another <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> European Constitution, {{rejected}} by France and the Netherlands in referenda.|$|R

5|$|The {{planning}} {{system is}} critical to the viability and operation of GA aerodromes. With many cities lacking scheduled air transport services between them, and with GA access to commercial airports becoming increasingly difficult and expensive, a viable network of aerodromes supporting GA air transport operations is regarded as an important national issue. However, there is no unified national planning policy specific to GA aerodromes, and planning decisions relating to these are based on local issues that are not required to consider the national impact. Because aircraft are excluded from noise control legislation, the only recourse for people affected by aircraft noise is through the planning process, and this <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> principal factor on which the majority of planning decisions relating to GA land use are made. GA is a specialist subject often unfamiliar to Local Planning Authorities, and most planning decisions relating to GA either refuse permission, or grant it with restrictive conditions. Little Gransden is just one example of a GA airfield required to comply with planning restrictions on the number of movements permitted, thereby inhibiting further development. Such restrictions, if poorly conceived, can make GA operations unviable or even unsafe.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} political <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> {{recognition of}} the Cornish people as a minority.|$|E
