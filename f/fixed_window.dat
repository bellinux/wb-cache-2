40|$|The {{identification}} of individual trees using LIDAR technology has lately {{been one of}} the latest innovations in remote sensing applied to forest inventory. In this paper, we aimed evaluate the performance of LiDAR data for individual tree detection in Eucalyptus sp plantation using filter of variable and <b>fixed</b> <b>windows</b> size applied by Local Maximum (LM) algorithm implemented in FUSION software. The results show that LiDAR has a good accuracy of tree individual tree detection, and that filter of <b>fixed</b> <b>windows</b> (FJF) size has a better performance than filter of variable windows size (FJV). The better accuracy to individual tree detection using <b>fixed</b> <b>windows</b> size was of the 98. 57 %, whereas in variable windows size was of the 17, 07 %. We conclude that FJF has a good performance when applied to individual tree detection in Eucalyptus sp plantation. Pages: 6081 - 608...|$|R

40|$|Wang-Landau {{sampling}} (WLS) {{of large}} systems requires dividing the energy range into "windows" and joining {{the results of}} simulations in each window. The resulting density of states (and associated thermodynamic functions) are shown to suffer from boundary effects in simulations of lattice polymers and the five-state Potts model. Here, we implement WLS using adaptive windows. Instead of defining <b>fixed</b> energy <b>windows</b> (or windows in the energy-magnetization plane for the Potts model), the boundary positions depend {{on the set of}} energy values on which the histogram is flat at a given stage of the simulation. Shifting the windows each time the modification factor f is reduced, we eliminate border effects that arise in simulations using <b>fixed</b> <b>windows.</b> Adaptive windows extend significantly the range of system sizes that may be studied reliably using WLS...|$|R

40|$|TCP is {{the widely}} used {{protocol}} for its reliable data communication over the network. Though {{it is used}} for enabling communication over the large network, it has some incapability in handling continues data transmission with reduced congestion over the internet. One of the most problems of TCP is <b>fixing</b> <b>window</b> size that turned to have a balanced allocation of buffer in accordance to handling congestion and traffic in a network. In this paper we present a framework for TCP congestion, called “Delay and Bandwidth based estimation”, which defines an exact window size that to be assigned to have balanced configuration of bandwidth with respect to delay. It tries {{to find out the}} round-trip-time to decide to <b>fix</b> <b>window</b> size by increasing or decreasing the boundaries of a buffer. Firstly we have discussed overview of TCP and its AQM. Then steady state of the window size is investigated via normalizing bandwidth factor. Finally simulation is conducted to compare with traditional TCP-Vegas under different network environments...|$|R

50|$|A <b>fixed</b> <b>window</b> is {{a window}} that cannot be opened, whose {{function}} is limited to allowing light to enter (unlike an unfixed window, which can open and close). Clerestory windows in church architecture are often fixed. Transom windows may be fixed or operable.
