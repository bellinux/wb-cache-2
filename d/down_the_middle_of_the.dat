The thickness and size of the plica mediana can vary between species, and except in treeshrews, it is cartilaginous and provides support for the sublingua.|$|E
5|$|MN610 was {{originally}} planned to extend west to I-94 in Maple Grove, and the freeway's mile markers reflected these plans, with {{the zero point}} calibrated to this future terminus. A portion of this section is very unusual; it is routed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> median of CR81 in Maple Grove, forming a roadway within a roadway.|$|E
5|$|Shevchenko, who {{had scored}} the decisive penalty against Juventus' Gianluigi Buffon in 2003, {{then had to}} score or Liverpool would win. He hit his penalty {{straight}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goal. Dudek went down to his right, but blocked the shot with his left hand. Liverpool thus won the penalty shootout by a score of 3–2.|$|E

5|$|In 1494, the {{principal}} maritime powers, Portugal and Spain, signed a treaty which drew a line <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic Ocean and allocated all trade routes {{to the east}} of the line to Portugal. That gave Portugal dominance of the only known route to the east—via the Cape of Good Hope and Indian Ocean, which left Spain, and later other countries, to seek a western route to the Pacific. The exploration of the south began as part of the search for such a route.|$|E
5|$|A frog's skin is protective, has a {{respiratory}} function, {{can absorb}} water and helps control body temperature. It has many glands, {{particularly on the}} head and back, which often exude distasteful and toxic substances (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky and helps keep the skin moist, protects against the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the animal slippery and more able to escape from predators. The skin is shed every few weeks. It usually splits <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> back and across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards the head where it is quickly eaten.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 the Dade County Planning Board {{announced}} {{a plan to}} build a highway connecting Key Biscayne with the Overseas Highway on Key Largo. The project envisioned bridges connecting artificial islands, to be built on the Safety Valve and existing small keys to Elliott Key and on to Key Largo. Áleman was expected to donate the right-of-way for a road running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> island to the first bridge at Cape Florida. With the prospect of a major highway passing through his property, Áleman rushed to prepare it for development: he had it completely cleared, leveled and filled in. A seawall was constructed along the western (Biscayne Bay) side of the Cape Florida property.|$|E

5|$|It differs in {{appearance}} from the similar {{lesser yellow-headed vulture}} in several ways. It {{is larger than the}} lesser yellow-headed vulture, with a longer, broader tail. The plumage is a dark, glossy black in contrast to the lesser yellow-headed vulture's browner plumage. Its legs are darker in color and its head is more yellow and less orange/pink than that of the lesser yellow-headed vulture. Its wings are broader and its flight is also steadier. Unlike {{the other members of the}} genus Cathartes, the greater yellow-headed vulture has relatively dark inner primaries, which contrast slightly with the paler secondaries and outer primaries. The greater yellow-headed vulture prefers to live in forests while the lesser yellow-headed vulture prefers to inhabit savannas, and it is more heavily built than the lesser yellow-headed vulture. The greater yellow-headed vulture is also somewhat larger than the turkey vulture. It can be distinguished from that species only at relatively close range by the differing head coloration. The underwing coloration is similar to the turkey vulture but the greater yellow-headed usually has a faint but broad and dark band vertically <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wings.|$|E
5|$|One of Mickal's {{most notable}} games came in 1934 against the Mustangs of Southern Methodist. He threw two {{touchdown}} passes, {{the first one}} a 32-yarder {{to tie the game}} at 7–7 in the second quarter. Late in the fourth quarter and down by a touchdown, Mickal dropped back at his own 35-yard line and hurled a pass <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field. It was caught in stride at the Mustang 20-yard line by Gaynell Tinsley, who ran it into the end zone to tie the game at 14–14, which was the final score. In week four against 13th-ranked Arkansas, Mickal completed five of seven passes for 117 yards, which included a 52-yard bomb in the third quarter for the first score of the 16–0 win. He also averaged over 50 yards per punt on nine punts. The next week he threw a touchdown pass, kicked a field goal, and averaged over 40 yards per punt in a 29–0 win over previously undefeated Vanderbilt. Mickal was named a first-team All-SEC selection as a fullback by the Associated Press (AP) and as a halfback by the UP.|$|E

25|$|The {{protected}} area or danger {{area is the}} central portion of the pitch—a rectangle running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pitch, two feet wide, and beginning five feet from each popping crease.

25|$|The {{sagittal}} plane is {{the plane that}} divides the body or an organ vertically into right and left sides. If this vertical plane runs directly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> body, {{it is called the}} midsagittal or median plane. If it divides the body into unequal right and left sides, it is called a para{{sagittal plane}}, or less commonly a longitudinal section.|$|E

In many places, the IDL follows the 180° meridian exactly. In other places, however, the IDL deviates east or west away from that meridian. These various deviations generally accommodate the political and/or economic affiliations of the affected areas.|$|E

25|$|Hobo spiders have a light stripe running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sternum. If {{the spider}} instead has {{three or four}} pairs of light spots on the lateral {{portions}} of the sternum, then {{it is one of}} the other two related Eratigena species. However absence of spots is not conclusive proof that the spider is a hobo spider, since the spots on other Eratigena species may be extremely faint and not readily visible.|$|E
25|$|If {{the first}} quarter was a minor struggle, {{the rest of the}} game was {{relatively}} easy for the Buccaneers, as signified by the first play of the second period. Brad Johnson, who had yet another strong day, pump-faked left from the Bengals’ 35-yard line, drawing coverage away from Rickey Dudley <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> field. Johnson then lofted a perfect pass to a wide-open Dudley for a 35-yard touchdown. It was Dudley's second score in two games as a Buccaneer.|$|E

Half skins were sewn around each side.|$|E
25|$|Related to {{the project}} was the {{realignment}} of the Mitchell Freeway between Loftus and McDonald Streets. At the time, the northbound and southbound carriages of the freeway in this section were constructed next to each other. To allow for the rail corridor <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> freeway, that section of road required realignment. While necessary bridges and some associated works for the realignment were included {{as part of the}} project cost, the rebuilding of the section of road in the realigned section was funded separately from the project, using regular road funding sources.|$|E
25|$|Settlement in the Incipient and Early Mumun Pottery Period I was sparse and {{concentrated}} in Eoeun (NRICH 2004:141-142). The same area was the location for {{a settlement of}} narrow rectangular pit-houses with plans that are not unlike those of the Huron and Iroquoian longhouses of Southern Ontario, Canada. For example, these pit-houses {{had a series of}} 2 - 4 hearths lined <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>middle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> structure, indicating that the occupants were likely members of an extended, multi-generational household (Bale and Ko 2006).
