40|$|People {{make many}} {{decisions}} {{throughout the day}} involving finances, food and health. Many of these decisions involve considering alternatives that will occur {{at some point in}} the future. Behavioural economics is a field that studies how people make these decisions (Camerer, 1999) [[Au: The reference “Camerer (1999) ” is cited in the text but not listed. Please check. ]]. It shows that people are driven by short-term gratification (reward or benefit). For example: given a choice between choosing $ 5 now or $ 10 in 2 weeks, people tend to choose the sooner, smaller reward. But choosing the delayed reward, i. e. delaying gratification, can actually be beneficial in the long term. How can we motivate consumers to resist the ‘now’ and invest in their future (e. g. develop sustainable or healthy habits) ? In our current research we performed a laboratory experiment, in which we examined whether we can increase the perceived value of a (delayed) environmental benefit using tailored communication, i. e. change the way it is framed. More specifically, we investigated whether we can boost the value of an abstract, long-term <b>green</b> <b>claim</b> in a product by expressing it as a concrete, short-term benefit. We confirmed our hypothesis that by appropriately communicating the <b>green</b> <b>claim,</b> we can boost the perceived value of it. Therefore, to motivate consumers to buy a product with an environmental benefit, it needs to have a <b>green</b> <b>claim</b> expressed as a concrete and short-term benefit...|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{veracity}} of a <b>green</b> <b>claim</b> made by CNW marketing research Inc., I created a green baloney detection kit. It {{will serve as a}} guiding post by which anyone can assess the potential environmental impact of any action taken {{on the basis of the}} claims made by CNW in their dust to dust report. In their report they state that after doing an extensive life cycle analysis of several cars sold in the United States in 2005, they found that high fuel economy did not necessarily correlate to a smaller environmental impact, but rather the biggest contribution to the environmental impact of automobiles is in their end-of-life disposal. My green baloney detection kit will be an adaptation of Carl Sagan's original baloney detection kit, which is a series of probes which serve as a pillar for detecting fallacious arguments or claims. My enquiries show that the Dust to Dust report does not pass the green baloney detection kit and with it nontechnical environmentally conscious automotive consumers can determine that the claims made by CNW are not scientifically sound and so their decisions should be based on those claims. by Irina Mateko Azu.

40|$|Regional {{endogenous}} {{products are}} commonly perceived by consumers as cultural commodities. In a global market, where culturally differentiated products {{are difficult to}} shift {{due to the lack}} of awareness of their associated benefits, regional endogenous products are less appealing to consumers than mass-branded goods. As a consequence, regional products are mainly acquired by local consumers, narrowing the potential market to those who are mainly interested in regionally differentiated goods. A paradigm change related to endogenous resource products must be developed to widespread their market to a global scale, promoting a larger consumer-base and consequently enhancing local dynamics and competitive positioning of the regional ecosystems where such goods are produced. The purpose of this study is to explore the sustainability characteristics of endogenous products associated to the Portuguese Beiras Region and their role as a differentiation claim to a global mass-market. In-depth interviews were conducted with local Academia researchers and decision makers in order to explore the benefits of leveraging the sustainability dimension of local produced goods and forecast their effect on a global mass-market. Preliminary findings allowed inferring about the significance of the proposed <b>green</b> <b>claim,</b> but a gap was identified regarding the lack of information to customers regarding the associated distinctive attributes. Further research is needed to assess the remaining multiple-helix actors of the local ecosystem on identifying and developing the most promising strategies to effectively promote local endogenous produce to a global market. info:eu-repo/semantics/submittedVersio...|$|E

40|$|As <b>green</b> <b>claims</b> on product {{packaging}} {{flood the}} marketplace, {{the opportunities for}} companies to market their products as environmentally friendly has significantly increased over the past decade. Consumers are concerned about {{their impact on the}} environment and want to purchase products that are safe and eco-friendly. Unfortunately, some companies have taken advantage of this growth in demand by marketing products as green when they are not necessarily better for the environment. These companies are placing false claims on product packaging, which is a type of misleading environmental marketing called greenwash. This paper will discuss what greenwashing is, why it's a problem, what is being done to prevent it, and how consumers can avoid it. The purpose of Recognizing and Avoiding Greenwash is to educate the reader about the characteristics of greenwash and provide them with steps for determining if a green product is legitimate. This paper will also provide the reader with a better understanding of <b>green</b> <b>claims</b> and certifications. Since green products are becoming mainstream, it's important for consumers to understand <b>green</b> <b>claims</b> to ensure that they are purchasing products that are truly better for the environment and not simply portrayed as better through greenwashing.

40|$|It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that green advertising {{is on the}} rise, although practitioners {{have to contend with}} low credibility of environmental claims due to a variety of reasons. Greenwashing and consumers’ lack of knowledge concerning environmental issues, for example, make people distrustful of green advertising. This interesting evolution notwithstanding, research assessing the credibility of green ads is virtually non-existent. Moreover, there is no literature employing content analysis as a methodology to predict the credibility and greenness of ads conveying an environmentally-friendly stance. This study attempts to fill this void using qualitative content analysis employing the Means-End Chain Conceptualization of Advertising Strategy (MECCAS) model to divide genuine environmental print ads into five incremental levels of greenness. Levels are allocated based on a specific combination of five variables assessing whether a particular green feature (e. g. <b>green</b> <b>claim,</b> green look) is present or absent. A whole volume of two Flemish weeklies and one monthly was selected and every ad was carefully examined. This resulted in a pool of 162 ads trying to convey greenness to a minimum extent. Coding was carried out by one none-expert judge and intrajudge reliability was calculated for each variable separately by recoding a subset of ads. The lowest reliability was 0. 78, while all others exceeded 0. 90, thus meeting stability standards. Results indicate that many advertisers have not yet discovered the rich potential of green advertising since nearly half of the ads studied can merely be awarded the lowest level of greenness. Subsequently, an offline survey was conducted among 52 Flemish respondents in order to assess people’s judgments of greenness and credibility of the same ads used in the content analysis. This survey revealed that the MECCAS model does not live up to expectations in predicting respondents’ judgments since the MECCAS variables explained a low, yet significant proportion of variance in credibility (R²=. 104, F (7, 1033) = 18. 18, p=. 000) and greenness (R²=. 137, F (5, 1033) = 33. 90, p=. 000). This study also indicates that green ads do indeed suffer a rather low credibility (M= 4. 13, SD= 2. 74, measured on an 11 -point Likert-scale ranging from 0 to 10). Thus it can be assumed that we still have a long journey to travel before people’s confidence in green advertising will be restored and before the earth together with its rich fauna and flora can finally benefit from greener products...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} study {{is on the}} green marketing but specifically on consumers’ attitudes and purchase intention of eco-friendly products. It has been the global concern {{for the purpose of}} the preservation of the polluting and degradation of environment. Many studies have been done on the green marketing exploring the importance of the topic and relationship to the attitude and purchasing behavior of the consumers of eco-friendly products. Through the vital information provided by the expertise, competent and experience researchers, companies have understood the importance of green marketing in order to produce eco-friendly products and these provided much rich information for the literature studies of the thesisThe objective of this research was looked into and explored the influencing of the four traditional marketing-mix elements, satisfaction and word of mouth (WOM) on attitude and purchasing intentions of consumers on eco-friendly products specifically fasting moving consumer goods (FMCG) or non-durable ones. The {{purpose of the study was}} to obtain information from consumers’ point of view. Furthermore, one perspective of the study was to look into the comparison of the Swedish and the Non-Swedish their attitudes towards eco-friendly products. A questionnaire provided to obtain the views of the Swedish and others nationalities, how they are influenced by the marketing-mix elements (4 P), satisfaction and WOM concerning green attitudes and purchase intention of eco-friendly products. A quantitative approach was adopted for the study by using a questionnaire, one paper version and another online version the total sample was composed of 174 respondents, 81 were collected through internet by using Google. doc surveys and Facebook and 93 by using standard paper questionnaire form. Furthermore, convenient sample was used to collect data so the chosen boundary was Umeå University and its residents. Our findings indicated that consumers who already bought eco-friendly products and those who are satisfied by these previous purchases were willing to repeat purchases. Indeed satisfaction goes with purchase intention. Furthermore the importance of WOM and Advertising about green products the fact that consumers believe in <b>green</b> <b>claim</b> explain the variance of the purchase intention. Positive attitudes concerning willingness to pay an extra price for green products are also correlated with purchase intention. However we discovered also that positive attitudes towards green products do not always lead to action i. e. purchase of these products. Our findings demonstrated that there were differences in attitudes and purchase intention toward green products between mainly the women and men and between the Swedish and the Non-Swedish...|$|E

40|$|The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission today issued updated {{guidance}} for businesses and industry {{on the use}} of environmental claims in marketing. "The ACCC has produced Green marketing and the Trade Practices Act in response to the increasing use of <b>green</b> <b>claims</b> in advertising by businesses seeking to differentiate themselves and their products from their competition by means of environmental claims," ACCC Chairman, Mr Graeme Samuel, said. "Businesses are aware that consumers are concerned about the environmental impact of the goods they purchase, and therefore look to promote the environmental benefits of their products. However, 2 ̆ 7 green 2 ̆ 7 and other environmental claims are often based on complex scientific principles, making it difficult for consumers to assess their accuracy or to compare one claim against another. " <b>Green</b> <b>claims</b> are now made about a larger product range than ever before, from small household items to major whitegoods and appliances. Environmental concerns, such as water or energy efficiency, are a major factor many consumers consider when evaluating products to purchase. It is essential that consumers have accurate information on which to base their decisions. Mr Samuel said the publication aims to educate businesses about their obligations under the Trade Practices Act 1974 and to assist manufacturers, suppliers, advertisers and others to assess the strength of any <b>green</b> <b>claims</b> they make. This will help to improve the accuracy and usefulness to consumers of their labelling, packaging and advertising. The release of Green marketing and the Trade Practices Act follows recent ACCC action over potentially misleading environmental marketing claims in the energy industry. The ACCC continues to scrutinise the <b>green</b> <b>claims</b> made in a variety of markets and will take appropriate action against any business making misleading or unsupportable environmental claims.  ...|$|R
