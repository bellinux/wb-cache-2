25|$|The central {{relationship}} in Bellini's life {{seems to have}} been with Francesco Florimo, originally a student friend at the Naples Conservatory. Florimo came from a village near Catania. Throughout Bellini's lifetime, the two shared a close correspondence, the source of much of the <b>information</b> <b>we</b> have concerning the composer's life. Bellini wrote sometimes very long letters to him from the many places he lived and traveled to. Meanwhile, Florimo remained in Naples, ultimately becoming the Conservatory librarian.|$|E
25|$|The most {{reliable}} <b>information</b> <b>we</b> have about ancient poets is largely drawn {{from their own}} works. Unfortunately, Apollonius of Rhodes reveals nothing about himself. Most of the biographical material comes from four sources: two are texts entitled Life of Apollonius found in the scholia on his work (Vitae A and B); a third is an entry in the 10th-century encyclopaedia the Suda; and fourthly a 2nd-century BCE papyrus, P.Oxy. 1241, which provides names of several heads of the Library of Alexandria. Other scraps can be gleaned from miscellaneous texts. The reports from all the above sources however are scanty and often self-contradictory.|$|E

25|$|These studies {{point to}} the fact that even though we only attend to and process limited <b>information,</b> <b>we</b> have a vast amount of {{knowledge}} at our disposal through our highly unrestricted sensory registers. It is the selective attention, perception, and higher order cognitive processing that limits these inputs and it is precisely these processes that make up our conscious awareness. Thus, in order to formulate some explanations for Plato's Problem, our conscious awareness limits our experience; nevertheless, it seems as though some stimuli that are sensed by our sensory registers, although seemingly rejected by conscious awareness, are actually retained and abstracted into our memories for further processing. All of our fully functioning perceptual faculties enhance, supplement, and optimize our experiences.|$|E

25|$|The {{application}} of Newton's law of gravity has enabled {{the acquisition of}} much of the detailed <b>information</b> <b>we</b> have about the planets in the Solar System, the mass of the Sun, and details of quasars; even the existence of dark matter is inferred using Newton's law of gravity. Although we have not traveled to all the planets nor to the Sun, we know their masses. These masses are obtained by applying the laws of gravity to the measured characteristics of the orbit. In space an object maintains its orbit because of the force of gravity acting upon it. Planets orbit stars, stars orbit galactic centers, galaxies orbit a center of mass in clusters, and clusters orbit in superclusters. The force of gravity exerted on one object by another is directly proportional to the product of those objects' masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.|$|E
25|$|Mashrab (1640-1711) — an {{influential}} Sufi poet. Boborahim Mashrab {{was born in}} 1657. He went to Qashqar and increased his knowledge under supervision of Ofoq Hoja. From 1673 {{up to the end}} of his life he lived as a tramp. In 1711 he was murdered by hokim of Balh Mahmud Taragay. In M. Namangoniy`s “ Tazkiratul-avliyo”, I. Bogistoniy`s “Tazkirai-qalandaron”, M. Samarqandiy`s “Muzakkiri – ashob”, Hakimhon`s “Muhtabat – tavorih”, M. Olim`s “Ansobus-Salotin” we may find some information about his life and works. The Russian scientists N.I. Veselovskiy, N.S. Likoshin, V.L. Vyatkin expressed important ideas about Mashrab`s creative works in 19th and 20th centuries. Also some specialists in Uzbek literature such as I. Sulton, V. Zohidov, I. Muminov, G. Gulom, A.Hayitmetov, A. Abdugafurov, E. Shodiyev, V. Abdullayev expressed their own opinion about Mashrab’s life and creative activity. More detailed <b>information</b> <b>we</b> find in “Qissai Mashrab” by Pirmat Setoriy.
