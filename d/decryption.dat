5|$|In {{the first}} months of 1940, Alan Turing—principal {{designer}} of the British cryptological Bombe, elaborated from the Polish bomba—would visit Bruno to confer about Enigma <b>decryption</b> with the three Polish cryptologists.|$|E
5|$|The AACS LA {{announced}} on April 16 {{that it had}} revoked the <b>decryption</b> keys associated with certain software high-definition DVD players, which {{will not be able}} to decrypt AACS encrypted disks mastered after April 23, without an update of the software.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of tools {{intended}} specifically to decrypt files locked by ransomware, although successful recovery may not be possible. If the same encryption key is used for all files, <b>decryption</b> tools use files for which there are both uncorrupted backups and encrypted copies (a known-plaintext attack in the jargon of cryptanalysis); recovery of the key, if it is possible, may take several days. Free ransomware <b>decryption</b> tools can help decrypt files encrypted by the following forms of ransomware: AES_NI, Alcatraz Locker, Apocalypse, BadBlock, Bart, BTCWare, Crypt888, CryptoMix, CrySiS, EncrypTile, FindZip, Globe, Hidden Tear, Jigsaw, LambdaLocker, Legion, NoobCrypt, Stampado, SZFLocker, TeslaCrypt, XData.|$|E

30|$|In the {{authentication}} protocol, {{there are}} only four rounds. For the computational complexity of the authentication protocol, the user generates one conventional signature and verifies another, computes n XOR-homomorphic encryptions and n XOR-homomorphic <b>decryptions,</b> and performs n modular multiplications over homomorphic ciphertexts (i.e., Enc_pk_i (r_i^j)·C_i^j for j= 1,⋯,n). The verifier verifies one conventional signature, computes n+ 2 modular multiplications, 2 n <b>decryptions,</b> and performs n Jacobi computations to check Enc_pk_i (r_i^j) for j= 1,⋯,n. In total, there are n XOR-homomorphic encryptions, 3 n XOR-homomorphic <b>decryptions,</b> two signature verifications, one signature generation, n Jacobi computations, and 2 n+ 2 modular multiplications during the entire authentication protocol.|$|R
5|$|Users {{must have}} either found <b>decryption</b> keys {{themselves}} or obtained them elsewhere for most versions of BackupHDDVD to work. The utility reads a text file containing volume or title keys {{and attempts to}} find a set of corresponding keys for the inserted disc. Through a standard AES library, it then decrypts each video file on the disc using the appropriate keys and writes the results to a location specified by the user. Direct file <b>decryption</b> allows the utility's functionality to remain unaffected by device key revocation and its performance unencumbered with AACS overhead.|$|E
5|$|Before the war, Palluth, a {{lecturer}} in the 1929 secret Poznań University cryptology course, had been co-owner of AVA, which produced equipment for the Cipher Bureau, and knew many details of the <b>decryption</b> technology. In Warsaw, under German occupation, other Cipher Bureau workers were interrogated by German intelligence commissions, and some AVA workers were approached by German agents, but all kept silent about compromises to Enigma.|$|E
5|$|Following Allied {{victory in}} the Battle of the Atlantic – through {{long-range}} aircraft, radar, code <b>decryption,</b> and better escort tactics – the need to camouflage ships from submarines greatly decreased, and diffused lighting research became a low priority. The work was halted when the war ended.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new cryptanalytic technique based on Wagner 's boomerang and inside-out attacks. We first describe this new attack {{in terms of the}} original boomerang attack, and then demonstrate its use on reduced-round variants of the MARS core and Serpent. Our attack breaks eleven rounds of the MARS core with 2 partial <b>decryptions.</b> Our attack breaks eight rounds of Serpent with 2 <b>decryptions...</b>|$|R
50|$|Room 40's <b>decryptions</b> {{also led}} to the capture of Captain Franz von Rintelen, a German Naval Intelligence officer who had firebombed munitions ships and {{factories}} in the neutral United States.|$|R
50|$|William Weisband, Sr. (August 28, 1908 - May 14, 1967) was an American {{cryptanalyst}} and NKVD agent (code name 'LINK'), {{best known}} for his role in revealing U.S. <b>decryptions</b> of Soviet diplomatic and intelligence codes to Soviet intelligence.|$|R
5|$|Most major belligerents {{attempted}} {{to solve the}} problems of complexity and security involved in using large codebooks for cryptography by designing ciphering machines, the most well known being the German Enigma machine. Development of SIGINT (signals intelligence) and cryptanalysis enabled the countering process of <b>decryption.</b> Notable examples were the Allied <b>decryption</b> of Japanese naval codes and British Ultra, a pioneering method for decoding Enigma benefiting from information given to Britain by the Polish Cipher Bureau, which had been decoding early versions of Enigma before the war. Another aspect of military intelligence was the use of deception, which the Allies used to great effect, such as in operations Mincemeat and Bodyguard. Other technological and engineering feats achieved during, or as a result of, the war include the world's first programmable computers (Z3, Colossus, and ENIAC), guided missiles and modern rockets, the Manhattan Project's development of nuclear weapons, operations research and the development of artificial harbours and oil pipelines under the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|The 1979 Polish film Sekret Enigmy (The Enigma Secret) is a {{generally}} fair, if superficial, {{account of the}} Cipher Bureau's story. Twenty-two years later, the 2001 Hollywood film Enigma was criticized for its many historical inaccuracies, including omission of Poland's fundamental work in Enigma <b>decryption.</b>|$|E
5|$|There is no {{encryption}} algorithm {{present in the}} Agrippa binary; consequently, the visual encryption effect that displays when the poem has finished is a ruse. The visual effect {{is the result of}} running the decrypted ciphertext (in memory) through the re-purposed bit-scrambling <b>decryption</b> algorithm, and then abandoning the text in memory. Only the fake genetic code is written back to disk.|$|E
2500|$|The Venona <b>decryptions</b> {{were also}} {{important}} in the exposure of the atomic spy Klaus Fuchs. Some of the earliest messages decrypted concerned information from a scientist at the Manhattan Project, who was referred to by the code names of CHARLES and REST. One such message from Moscow to New York, dated April 10, 1945, called information provided by CHARLES [...] "of great value." [...] Noting that the information included [...] "data on the atomic mass of the nuclear explosive" [...] and [...] "details on the explosive method of actuating" [...] the atomic bomb, the message requested further technical details from CHARLES. [...] Investigations based on the VENONA <b>decryptions</b> eventually identified CHARLES and REST as Fuchs in 1949.|$|R
30|$|Due to the {{availability}} of powerful devices and high resources, inter-WBAN communication resembles the communication in WSNs. Therefore, we compare our proposed inter-WBAN communication scheme with LEAP+ [6], which is a lightweight extensible authentication protocol for WSN security. In inter-WBAN communication, the WBAN (node) joining and leaving may occur very frequently, so the keys need to be refreshed regularly thereby affecting the computation and communication costs of the scheme. The computation cost depends upon {{the total number of}} encryptions and <b>decryptions</b> taking place in the key agreement process. In a cluster-based key agreement scheme, the number of <b>decryptions</b> is equal to the network size (N) because every node has to decrypt the message.|$|R
5000|$|From 1936 - 1939, Lowry was {{an equal}} partner in espionage {{with her husband}} Iskhak Akhmerov, a Soviet NKVD {{intelligence}} agent. Iskhak Akhmerov operated an espionage network in the United States, and both of the Akhmerovs are referenced in VENONA <b>decryptions</b> of Soviet cable traffic: Lowry is listed under the Soviet code name [...] "ADA" [...] (later changed to ELZA (ELSA)). As a native-born American and English speaker, Akhmerova was able to freely operate on behalf of Soviet intelligence. She was a full partner in her husband's espionage activity, and is referenced in several Venona project <b>decryptions.</b> In 1939, she married Akhmerov. [...] In 1945, Lowry was named by Soviet intelligence agent Elizabeth Bentley {{as one of her}} contacts.|$|R
5|$|Written by an {{anonymous}} programmer using the handle Muslix64, BackupHDDVD is distributed {{with none of}} the cryptographic keys necessary for <b>decryption.</b> Users wanting to use the software to decrypt a protected disc's contents must obtain the appropriate keys separately, a task with which neither the original author nor his or her versions of BackupHDDVD assist.|$|E
5|$|In 1929, while {{studying}} mathematics at Poznań University, Rejewski attended a secret cryptology course {{conducted by the}} Polish General Staff's Cipher Bureau (Biuro Szyfrów), which he joined in September 1932. The Bureau had had no success in reading Enigma-enciphered messages and set Rejewski {{to work on the}} problem in late 1932; he deduced the machine's secret internal wiring after only a few weeks. Rejewski and his two colleagues then developed successive techniques for the regular <b>decryption</b> of Enigma messages. His contributions included the cryptologic card catalog, derived using the cyclometer that he had invented, and the cryptologic bomb.|$|E
5|$|On December 26, 2006, {{a person}} using the alias muslix64 {{published}} a utility named BackupHDDVD and its source code on the DVD <b>decryption</b> forum at the website Doom9. BackupHDDVD {{can be used}} to decrypt AACS protected content once one knows the encryption key. muslix64 claimed to have found title and volume keys in main memory while playing HD DVDs using a software player, and that finding them is not difficult.|$|E

50|$|If the keysize is k, {{this attack}} uses only 2k+1encryptions (and <b>decryptions)</b> (and O(2k) memory {{in case a}} look-up table have been built for the set of forward computations) in {{contrast}} to the naive attack, which needs 22·k encryptions but O(1) space.|$|R
50|$|Other Venona decrypts {{revealed}} further damaging {{evidence against}} White, including White's {{suggestions on how}} to meet and pass information on to his Soviet handler. Venona Document #71 contains <b>decryptions</b> of White's discussions on being paid for his work for the Soviet Union.|$|R
5|$|Some {{payloads}} consist simply of {{an application}} designed to lock or restrict the system until payment is made, typically by setting the Windows Shell to itself, or even modifying the {{master boot record}} and/or partition table to prevent the operating system from booting until it is repaired. The most sophisticated payloads encrypt files, with many using strong encryption to encrypt the victim's files {{in such a way}} that only the malware author has the needed <b>decryption</b> key.|$|E
5|$|Despite their travails, Rejewski and Zygalski had {{fared better}} than some of their colleagues. Cadix's Polish {{military}} chiefs, Langer and Ciężki, had also been captured by the Germans, {{as they tried to}} escape from France into Spain on the night of March 10–11, 1943 along with three other Poles: Antoni Palluth, Edward Fokczyński and Kazimierz Gaca. The first two became prisoners of war; the other three were sent as slave labourers to Germany, where Palluth and Fokczyński perished. Despite the varyingly dire circumstances in which they were held, none of them Stefan Mayer emphasizes betrayed the secret of Enigma's <b>decryption,</b> thus making it possible for the Allies to continue exploiting this vital intelligence resource.|$|E
5|$|Further {{development}} of BackupHDDVD was being hosted on SourceForge until the site received a DMCA takedown notice alleging a violation in late February. In {{compliance with the}} notice, the project was immediately removed. Several versions of BackupHDDVD have been released by individuals other than the original author, including some versions with GUIs {{and the ability to}} locate keys on the internet or scan for them in memory automatically. HDDecrypter, a port of BackupHDDVD to C with a native Windows GUI is also available. This version supports multiple CPU threads and runs faster than its Java counterparts. While {{development of}} BackupHDDVD has ceased, a commercial HD DVD <b>decryption</b> utility called Slysoft AnyDVD HD exists which relies on compromised AACS processing or media keys to allow for the backup or unrestricted viewing of any AACS-protected discs without the need for title or volume keys.|$|E

40|$|Definition An {{adaptive}} chosen ciphertext {{attack is}} an interactive chosen-ciphertext attack {{in which the}} adversary may send a number of ciphertexts to be decrypted, and use {{the results of these}} <b>decryptions</b> to select subsequent ciphertexts.

50|$|After Halperin's death, {{the release}} of the Venona project <b>decryptions</b> of coded Soviet cables, as well as {{information}} gleaned from Soviet KGB archives, revealed that Halperin was involved in espionage activities on behalf of the Soviet Union while serving in an official capacity with the United States government.|$|R
5|$|The AACS Licensing Authority (LA) assigns {{a series}} of 253 unique {{cryptographic}} keys to device manufacturers. When an AACS protected disc is manufactured, {{a series of}} up to 64 keys called title keys are generated and the video content on the disc is encrypted using these keys. The title keys are stored on the disc and themselves encrypted with another key called the volume unique key. The volume unique key for any disc can be calculated by all authorized devices using another key called a processing key, which is derived from a media key block stored on each disc. Authorized devices use {{one or more of}} the manufacturer's assigned device keys to decrypt the media key block, yielding a processing key and enabling further <b>decryption</b> of the volume and title keys, and finally the content.|$|E
5|$|The term Rosetta stone {{has been}} used idiomatically to {{represent}} a crucial key {{in the process of}} <b>decryption</b> of encoded information, especially when a small but representative sample is recognised as the clue to understanding a larger whole. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the first figurative use of the term appeared in the 1902 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica relating to an entry on the chemical analysis of glucose. Another use of the phrase is found in H. G. Wells' 1933 novel The Shape of Things to Come, where the protagonist finds a manuscript written in shorthand that provides a key to understanding additional scattered material that is sketched out in both longhand and on typewriter.|$|E
5|$|The view of {{communism}} was also affected by evidence of espionage in the US conducted by {{agents of the}} USSR. In 1945, a Soviet spy, Elizabeth Bentley, repudiated the USSR and provided a list of Soviet spies in the US to the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). The FBI also had access to secret Soviet communications, available from the Venona <b>decryption</b> effort, which revealed significant efforts by Soviet agents to conduct espionage within the US. The growing influence {{of communism}} {{around the world and}} the evidence of Soviet spies within the US motivated the Department of Justicespearheaded by the FBIto initiate an investigation of communists within the US.|$|E
30|$|This {{homomorphic}} protocol comes {{without the}} need of a third party. By contrast, fetching the template load profiles {{as well as the}} distance computation itself is performed by the smart meter. All encryptions are performed with the public key, <b>decryptions</b> can only be performed by the smart meter, which is the only party owning the private key.|$|R
50|$|A mass of {{previously}} unremarked materials collectively {{known as the}} Venona project was declassified by the U.S. government in 1995. Among these were Army <b>decryptions</b> of Soviet cables which revealed there to be some number of American citizens involved in espionage {{on behalf of the}} Soviet Union. Magdoff was among those investigated as a member of what was called the Perlo group.|$|R
