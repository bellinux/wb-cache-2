5|$|To {{the south}} lies {{an area of}} legal {{buildings}} known as the Temple, formerly {{the property of the}} Knights Templar, which at its core includes two of the four Inns of Court: the Inner Temple and the Middle Temple. There are many lawyers' offices (especially barristers' chambers) in the vicinity. To the west, at the junction with Strand are the Royal Courts of Justice whilst at the eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> the Old Bailey is near Ludgate Circus.|$|E

5|$|Vine Street {{has long}} been {{associated}} with the police and law. Around 1751-2, a court house was built at the western <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> on the corner of what is now Piccadilly Place. It closed in 1836 following the reorganisation of the court system around Westminster and was subsequently occupied by the lawyer Edward Gaffin.|$|E
5|$|By 9:00am it was {{apparent}} that the two gunmen possessed superior weapons and ample ammunition. The police officers in charge on the scene, Superintendent Mulvaney and Chief Superintendent Stark, contacted Assistant Commissioner Major Frederick Wodehouse at Scotland Yard. He telephoned the Home Office and obtained permission from Churchill to bring in a detachment of Scots Guards, who were stationed at the Tower of London. It {{was the first time that}} the police had requested military assistance in London to deal with an armed siege. Twenty-one volunteer marksmen from the Guards arrived at about 10:00am and took firing positions at each <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> and in the houses opposite. The shooting continued without either side gaining any advantage.|$|E
5|$|The Whitehall Theatre {{opened in}} 1930 {{at the north}} west <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> on a site that had {{previously}} been Ye Old Ship Tavern in the 17th century. The revue Whitehall Follies opened in 1942, which drew controversy over its explicit content featuring the stripper and actress Phyllis Dixey. The theatre became known for its farces, reviving a tradition on Whitehall that had begun with court jesters at the palace during the 16th century. These included several plays featuring actor-manager Brian Rix throughout the 1950s and 60s, and 1981's satirical Anyone for Denis, written by John Wells and Private Eye editor Richard Ingrams. The venue was Grade II listed in 1996, and renamed the Trafalgar Studios in 2004.|$|E
50|$|The Stargarder Straße shows {{a slight}} curve at the crossroads, {{so that the}} Gethsemane Church forms a {{landmark}} which {{can be seen from}} both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>The</b> northern suburbs <b>of</b> Berlin now have few prestigious buildings, so the school and Evangelical church buildings provide most of this area's architectural interest.|$|R
50|$|The {{main road}} through Cannon Beach is Hemlock Street, which runs from <b>the</b> north <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{city to the}} south, through Tolovana Park. Both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> connect to U.S. Highway 101.|$|R
25|$|During Thatcher's premiership, {{terrorist}} threats led to <b>the</b> implementation <b>of</b> a second level of security. Guarded gates were added at both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Visitors {{could then be}} screened before approaching the door.|$|R
5|$|The village {{stretches}} primarily along {{a single}} carriageway road known as The Street. The north-eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> <b>Street</b> is a designated Conservation Area. The lack of development stems from its position within the Kent Downs Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) and a Site of Nature Conservation Interest, which influences local planning laws and limits permission to build new housing. All development is subject to {{a high level of}} scrutiny; any development that would adversely affect the natural beauty of the landscape will automatically be resisted, and large-scale development proposals must be accompanied by an environmental impact assessment. The last major development was that of the residential cul-de-sac Draysfield.|$|E
5|$|Several {{members of}} the Rothschild family had mansions at the western <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> Nathan Mayer Rothschild moved his banking {{premises}} to No.107 in 1825, {{and the construction of}} other large buildings, complete with ballrooms and marble staircases, led to the street being colloquially referred to as Rothschild Row. Ferdinand James von Rothschild lived at No.143 with his wife Evelina while Lionel de Rothschild lived at No.148. Melbourne House was designed by William Chambers for Peniston Lamb, 1st Viscount Melbourne and built between 1770 and 1774. In 1802, it was converted to apartments, and is now the Albany. The house has been the residence for the British Prime Ministers William Ewart Gladstone and Edward Heath. St James's Hall was designed by Owen Jones and built between 1857–8. Charles Dickens gave several readings of his novels in the hall, including Great Expectations and Oliver Twist. The hall hosted performances from Antonín Dvořák, Edvard Grieg and Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky. It was demolished in 1905 and replaced by the Piccadilly Hotel.|$|E
5|$|The road's {{name comes}} from the Old English strond, meaning {{the edge of a}} river, as it {{historically}} ran alongside the north bank of the River Thames. The street was popular with the British upper classes between the 12th and 17th centuries, with many historically important mansions being built between the Strand and the river. These included Essex House, Arundel House, Somerset House, Savoy Palace, Durham House and Cecil House. The aristocracy moved to the West End over the 17th century, following which the Strand became well known for coffee shops, restaurants and taverns. The street was a centre point for theatre and music hall during the 19th century, and several venues remain on the Strand. At the east <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street</b> are two historic churches: St Mary le Strand and St Clement Danes.|$|E

5|$|In the 18th century, {{coffee and}} chop houses were {{established}} on the street; Twinings was established at No.206 in 1706 by Thomas Twining, supplier of tea to Queen Anne. The company {{claims to be}} the oldest ratepayer in Westminster. The Grecian Coffee House ran from around 1702 to 1803, while Tom's ran from 1706 to around 1775. Though these premises were well-known, the alleyways around the Strand were regular haunts for pickpockets and prostitutes during this time. The Rose Tavern, at the eastern <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> was frequented by lawyers during the 18th century. It was later demolished and became Thanet Place. The Crown and Anchor was the main meeting place for the Catholic Association and helped established the Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829. It was later used for Catholic politicians such as Daniel O'Connell to address constituents. The original premises burned down in 1854, but was rebuilt. Simpson's-in-the-Strand originally started at No.100 in 1828 as a smoking and dining club. It later became a restaurant. The Strand was also notable in the 18th century as a centre for the British book trade, with numerous printers and publishers along the street. The prominent bookseller Andrew Millar is an example {{of one of the most}} successful publishers who owned a shop there.|$|E
5|$|The Old White Horse Cellar, at No.155, {{was one of}} {{the most}} famous {{coaching}} inns in England by the late 18th century, by which time the street had become a favourable location for booksellers. The Bath Hotel emerged around 1790, and Walsingham House was built in 1887. Both the Bath and the Walsingham were purchased and demolished, and the prestigious Ritz Hotel built on their site in 1906. Piccadilly Circus station, at the east <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street,</b> was designed by Charles Holden and built between 1925 and 1928. It was the first underground station to have no above-ground premises; the station is only accessible by subways from street level. The clothing store Simpson's was established at Nos.203–206 Piccadilly by Alec Simpson in 1936. During the 20th century, Piccadilly became known as a place to acquire heroin, and was notorious in the 1960s as the centre of London's illegal drug trade. Today, it is regarded as one of London's principal shopping streets. Its landmarks include the Ritz, Park Lane, Athenaeum and Intercontinental hotels, Fortnum & Mason, the Royal Academy, the RAF Club, Hatchards, the Embassy of Japan and the High Commission of Malta.|$|E

Pop jet fountains were placed at both <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>street.</b> <b>The</b> project was complemented by <b>the</b> construction <b>of</b> a direct entrance to the Universidad de Chile station, which included the first public escalators in Chile.|$|R
