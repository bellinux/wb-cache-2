I'm living here like a monk, I go to bed at 8 in the evening, eat and drink very little and don't feel at all at ease in this giant city with all the responsibility for the film.|$|E

I don't feel perfectly satisfied with the eyes of the large head, but I think <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> right, by taking out the lights carefully, if you will ask Hentschel not to do it before we have proofs. The drawing is getting much too rubbed." ...|$|E

[...] Kamara added: [...] "Now I am hungry for second helpings of success. And I am absolutely convinced <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> here. We will not look out of place in the First Division because we have so much quality." [...] County's manager Colin Murphy told the press: [...] "All credit to Bradford, they won it fair and square. And that does not always happen in football. Bradford are a very experienced side compared to mine. Maybe this came a year too early for my boys."

6000|$|... "I wouldn't do that," [...] advised Dave. [...] "It {{might hurt}} {{some of the}} {{machinery}} under the car. <b>I</b> think we <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> out somehow, Roger." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Likely enough I may {{run over}} myself {{as soon as}} I get the {{business}} there going all right; but of course I shall stay there if <b>I</b> <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> should <b>get</b> <b>it</b> done in half the time if I were present to push things on.

2500|$|Because {{of his own}} background, Laurents felt it was {{important}} for his heroine to be Jewish and share his outrage at injustice. He also thought it was time a mainstream Hollywood film had a Jewish heroine, and because Barbra Streisand was the industry's most notable Jewish star, he wrote the role of Katie Morosky for her. Laurents had already known Streisand for some time, having cast her in his 1962 Broadway musical <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Get</b> <b>it</b> For You Wholesale. Hubbell Gardiner, initially a secondary character, was drawn from several people Laurents knew. The first name was borrowed from urbane television producer Hubbell Robinson, who had hired Laurents to write an episode of ABC Stage 67. The looks and personality came from two primary sources: writer Peter Viertel and a man Laurents referred to only as [...] "Tony Blue Eyes," [...] an acquaintance who inspired the scene where the creative writing instructor reads Hubbell's short story to his class.|$|E
2500|$|While {{appearing}} at Blue Angel, theater director and playwright Arthur Laurents {{asked her to}} audition for a new musical comedy he was directing, <b>I</b> <b>Can</b> <b>Get</b> <b>It</b> for You Wholesale. She got the part of secretary to the lead actor businessman, played by then unknown Elliott Gould. They fell in love during rehearsals and eventually moved into a small apartment together. The show opened on March 22, 1962, at the Shubert Theater, and received rave reviews. Her performance [...] "stopped the show cold," [...] wrote Nickens, and she became Broadway's most exciting and youngest new star. Groucho Marx, while hosting the Tonight Show, told her that twenty was an [...] "extremely young age {{to be a success}} on Broadway." [...] Streisand received a Tony nomination and New York Drama Critic's prize for Best Supporting Actress. The show was recorded {{and it was the first}} time the public could purchase an album of her singing.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, very well," [...] cried Sparks, with an {{offended}} air, [...] "if {{you don't}} want to accommodate me, never mind, <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> elsewhere." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see," [...] said Ann Veronica, {{with the}} air of one who shares a difficulty, [...] "I've promised to go. I didn't realize--I don't see how <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> out of <b>it</b> now." ...|$|R
60|$|No, don't trouble. The poor chap's {{just turned}} in, {{dropping}} with sleep. I {{told him he}} might till I called him. I don't want much, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> easily <b>get</b> <b>it</b> myself. [He goes to a case {{and takes out a}} tin of meat and some ship's biscuits.] It's rather a nuisance that we've {{not been able to get}} any game lately.|$|R
6000|$|... "Sick!" [...] exclaimed poor Mrs. Cliff, as {{she sank}} upon a sofa. [...] "Yes, I am sick, {{but not in}} body, only in heart. Well, {{it is hard to}} tell you what is the matter. The nearest <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> to <b>it</b> is that it is wealth struck in, as measles {{sometimes}} strike in when they ought to come out properly, and one is just as dangerous as the other." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, that's all right, Dad. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> <b>it</b> {{home just}} as it is. There won't {{be much of a}} crowd on the subway train going uptown this time of day." ...|$|E
6000|$|...

6000|$|... "Yes, that is {{the only}} {{consolation}} <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>get</b> out of <b>it.</b> This movement has come into their lives like a new religion. It is a new religion--the religion of humanity. It does help them to forget mud and rain and cold and monotony." ...|$|R
