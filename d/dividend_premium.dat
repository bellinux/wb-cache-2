5000|$|According to {{the first}} approach, {{investor}} attention can be approximated with particular financial market-based measures. According to Gervais et al. (2001) and Hou et al. (2009), trading volume is a good proxy for investor sentiment. High (low) trading volume on a particular stock leads to appreciating (depreciating) of its price. Extreme one-day returns are also reported to draw investors’ attention (Barber & Odean (2008)). Noise traders tend to buy (sell) stocks with high (low) returns. Whaley (2001) and Baker & Wurgler (2007) suggest Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) Volatility Index (VIX) as an alternative market sentiment measure. Credit Suisse Fear Barometer (CSFB) is based on prices of zero-premium collars that expire in three months. This index is sometimes used {{as an alternative to}} VIX index. The Acertus Market Sentiment Indicator (AMSI) incorporates five variables (in descending order of weight in the indicator): Price/Earnings Ratio (a measure of stock market valuations); price momentum (a measure of market psychology); Realized Volatility (a measure of recent historical risk); High Yield Bond Returns (a measure of credit risk); and the TED spread (a measure of systemic financial risk). Each of these factors provides a measure of market sentiment through a unique lens, and together they may offer a more robust indicator of market sentiment. Closed-end fund discount (the case when net asset value of a mutual fund does not equal to its market price) reported to be possible measure of investor attention (Zweig (1973) and Lee et al. (1991)). The studies suggest an evidence that changes in discounts of closed-end funds are highly correlated with fluctuations in investor sentiment. Brown et al. (2003) investigate daily mutual fund flow as possible measure of investor attention. According to Da et al. (2014), [...] "...individual investors switch from equity funds to bond funds when negative sentiment is high." [...] <b>Dividend</b> <b>premium</b> (the difference between the average book-to-market ratios of dividend paying and not paying stocks) potentially can be a good predictor for investor sentiment (Baker & Wurgler (2004) and Vieira (2011)). Retail investor trades data is also reported to be able to represent investor attention (Kumar & Lee (2006)). The study shows that retail investor transactions [...] "...are systematically correlated — that is, individuals buy (or sell) stocks in concert". Initial Public Offering (IPO) of a company generate a big amount of information that can potentially be used to proxy investor sentiment. Ljungqvist et al. (2006) and Baker & Wurgler (2007) report IPO first-day returns and IPO volume the most promising candidates for predicting investor attention to a particular stock. It is not surprising that high investments in advertisement of a particular company results in a higher investor attention to corresponding stock (Grullon et al. (2004)). The authors in Chemmanur & Yan (2009) provide an evidence that [...] "...a greater amount of advertising is associated with a larger stock return in the advertising year but a smaller stock return in the year subsequent to the advertising year." [...] Equity issues over total new issues ratio, insider trading data, and other financial indicators are reported in Baker & Wurgler (2007) to be useful in investor attention measurement procedure.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Defined by Baker and Wurgler (2004 a), <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> is the {{difference}} between the average market-to-book ratio of dividend payers and non-payers. We study what <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> is by examining two explanations, agency explanation and signaling explanation. Using U. S. industrial firms from 1962 to 2004, we find evidence consistent with the agency theory that <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> is higher when the need to mitigate the agency problem is greater. In particular, <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> is positively related to {{the difference}} in cash holdings {{at the beginning of the}} year between dividend payers and nonpayers, and is negatively related to the difference in future profitability between dividend payers and nonpayers. In other words, investors value dividend payers with a higher premium when dividend payers have more cash and fewer profitable future investment projects than nonpayers. 1...|$|E
40|$|We {{propose that}} the {{catering}} theory of dividends will not hold when tested with an extended sample period, different formulations of the <b>dividend</b> <b>premium,</b> and subsets of our sample divided by industry. The catering theory implies that managers cater to irrational and timevarying investor demand for dividends. This demand can be proxied by a <b>dividend</b> <b>premium,</b> {{a comparison of the}} market-to-book ratio of payers versus non-payers. The <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> that the catering model is based on suffers from a very arbitrary derivation. We find that coefficients for the regression of catering using an extended sample period and different derivations of the <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> give results with smaller economic and statistical significance. Furthermore, tests of our sample by industry show that the <b>dividend</b> <b>premium,</b> supposedly a market-wide measure that affects all firms, has different effects on various industries. Though the catering theory finds significance given a particular methodology, further analysis shows that the model is based on spurious correlation, and not true causation. by Alexander W. Lue.

I categorize firms into those that paid dividends previously and those that did not. My results show that strong dividend stickiness exists and the determinants to pay differ significantly {{for the two groups}} of firms. High growth and low insider holdings make prior payers more likely to pay but prior nonpayers less likely to pay. Furthermore, prior payers are more sensitive to profitability and earned/contributed equity mix, while prior nonpayers are more sensitive to risk and <b>dividend</b> <b>premiums.</b> Finally, taking the prior payment status into account eliminates the problem of overestimating the portion of payers put forth by previous studies.

40|$|The {{catering}} {{theory of}} dividends proposed that corporate dividend policy {{is driven by}} prevailing investor demand for dividend payers, and that managers cater to investors by paying dividends when the <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> is high. While earlier research found that the <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> is not driven by traditional clienteles derived from market imperfections such as taxes, transaction costs, or institutional investment constraints, we find empirical evidence that demographic clienteles are {{an important source of}} the time-varying demand for dividend payers. In particular, we find that, as consistent with the behavioural life-cycle theory and the marginal opinion theory of stock price, the <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> is positively driven by demographic clientele variation represented by changes in the proportion of the older population. Our results are robust when controlled for the factors of investor sentiment, signalling, agency costs and time trend. ...|$|E
40|$|Differentiated {{dividends}} are {{a unique}} cash dividend payment scheme prevailing in Korea which allows managers {{to pay higher}} cash dividends to small shareholders than large shareholders. One of the important features of this dividend policy is that it provides an additional choice to managers when deciding on changing firms' dividend policy. Previous studies suggest that managers are expected to initiate differentiated dividends rather than stop paying dividends especially when their company is facing cash constraints. However, we find that a half of the firms changing to differentiated dividend are actually increasing their total dividend payment. In order to explain managers' motivation to initiate differentiated dividends, we employ the time varying fads, <b>dividend</b> <b>premium,</b> suggested by Baker and Wurgler. After conducting logit regressions, we find that <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> is positively associated with managers' incentive to initiate differentiated dividends especially when they increase total dividend amount. Also, the firms listed in different stock markets show different motivations when choosing to initiate different dividends...|$|E

This study examines several characteristics which influence consumers’ selection of auto insurance policy and their loyalty to one insurer.

A chi-square analysis was conducted to determine the relationship between age, race, gender, education background and automobiles’ market value to the selection of auto insurance policy. In addition, the relationship between <b>premium,</b> <b>dividend,</b> insurer’s internal factors, claim services and non-claim services to the loyalty of the consumer are also tested using the chi-square and Spearman rank test. The results indicate that education background and market value of the automobile are significant characteristics in selecting auto insurance policy, while <b>premium,</b> <b>dividend,</b> insurer internal factors, claim and non-claim services are not related to the loyalty of the consumer.

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] This dissertation contains 3 essays on dividend/payout policy. In the first essay, using a sample of 76, 129 firm-years from 32 countries, I show that both the probability and amount of dividend payments are significantly lower in countries with poor creditor rights. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that poor creditor protection exacerbates the agency costs of debt. Poorly-protected creditors have a strong incentive to protect their investment by restricting dividend payments through formal debt covenants and multiperiod contracting. Firm managers also have an incentive to restrict dividends in order to build reputation capital, thereby reducing moral hazard problems and financing costs. The second essay examines the impact of managerial myopia on dividend catering and is based on US firms. I find strong evidence that the sensitivity of dividend changes to <b>dividend</b> <b>premiums</b> increase with managerial myopia. These findings are robust to firm-characteristics, idiosyncratic risk, taxes, time trends and potential sample selection biases. The last essay documents that increasing use of repurchases largely explains the disappearing dividends puzzle documented by Fama and French (2001). I find no evidence of consistent declining propensity to pay out cash for US firms after controlling for changing firm characteristics. By extending the Fama and French (2001) methodology, I examine the behavior of abnormal payout amount. Results show that most firms pay out 92. 8 % of the predicted payout amount. These findings are consistent with dividend-repurchase substitution documented by Grullon and Michaely (2002) ...|$|R

This necessitates seeking alternative explanation for the dividend behavior of firms beyond the traditional determinants that have been established overtime. This paper examines the implication of the catering theory of dividend on the Nigerian Stock Exchange. Based on a sample of 386 firm-year observations drawn from 49 financial firms listed on the exchange, the study investigates the role of <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> (proxy for catering theory) and other firm level characteristics on dividend payout of the sampled firms. Panel data analysis was conducted using both fixed effect and random effect estimates.

Thus, indicating support for the catering theory of dividend. However, result indicates further that the theory is not supported during crisis.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{has three}} essays. In the first essay, I investigate whether {{the decision to}} repurchase stock is driven by investor demand for repurchases. Specifically, I hypothesize that firms cater to investor demand for repurchases by initiating repurchases when investors place premiums on the stock prices of repurchasing firms. I propose proxies (analogous to Baker and Wurgler (2004)) that measure the repurchase premium. I find that the lagged repurchase premium is positively and significantly related to repurchase initiation and continuation decisions, even after controlling for tax effects, year trends and alternate investment opportunities. I find that a greater fraction of dividend paying firms also repurchase stock when the repurchase premium has been high. The fraction of dividend payers that repurchase stock {{is found to be}} negatively related to the lagged <b>dividend</b> <b>premium,</b> establishing the competing attractiveness of dividends and repurchases based on the respective dividend and repurchase premium. Firms are more likely to repurchase stock when the repurchase premium is high and the difference between the repurchase and <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> is positive. The second essay looks at a relatively new way of buying back shares, called Accelerated Share Repurchases (ASRs). ASRs are credible commitments by firms to repurchase shares immediately. Including an ASR in a repurchase program reduces the flexibility that firms have to alter an announced program in response to subsequent changes in the price and liquidity of its stock, unexpected shocks to cash flow and/or investment, etc. We investigate whether firms' decisions to include ASRs in their repurchase programs are associated with factors expected to influence the costs of lost flexibility and the benefits of enhanced credibility and immediacy. The third essay looks at stock market trading characteristics around ASR announcements. I find that the trading costs decrease following an ASR announcement. On average, market quality improves; trading volume increases; and trade size increases following an ASR announcement. The information asymmetry component of spread also increases post ASR...|$|E
40|$|This {{interdisciplinary}} {{study examines}} how national culture affects corporate dividend policies. The dividend puzzle {{is one of}} the most studied, yet unresolved, issues in financial economics. Prior theoretical and empirical research has suggested several explanations of the dividend puzzle that are rooted mainly in agency, asymmetric information, “bird in hand”, and pecking order theories. The main intuition behind our analysis is that dividend policy may be determined not only by an objective assessment of the severity of agency and asymmetric information problems within a firm, but also by management's and investors’ subjective perceptions of these problems, which hinge on their national culture. Using Schwartz's national culture dimensions, Conservatism and Mastery, we find that Conservatism is positively related and Mastery negatively related to dividend payouts for a sample of 27, 462 firm-years from 21 countries between 1995 and 2007. These effects are robust to controls for a wide variety of other determinants of dividend policy – including investor protection, stock market performance, financial system configuration, tax advantage, economic development, and <b>dividend</b> catering <b>premium</b> – and to alternative culture proxies and sub-period windows. Our findings that national culture affects perceptions of and responses to agency and information asymmetry have important implications for policymakers and multinational enterprises. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a classical surplus process modified by {{the payment of}} dividends when the insurer’s surplus exceeds a threshold.

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{determinants}} of the dividend policy in Japan. First, our empirical investigations reveal that {{in contrast to the}} US case, the <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> is neither the determinant of the dividend initiations nor the continuations of the Japanese firms. Second, we newly find that the strong determinants of the Japanese firms ’ dividend initiations are the nonpayers ’ same year’s and previous year’s market-to-book ratios. In addition to the above, we also reveal that the strong determinants of the Japanese firms ’ dividend continuations are the payers ’ same year’s and previous year’s market-to-book ratios. These results clearly support our new hypothesis, the market valuation hypothesis of the dividend policy in Japan, and demonstrate our novel contributions of this study. Furthermore, our empirical results also indicate that the Japanese corporate managers can foresee their own firms ’ earnings for at most two years ahead. We consider that this evidence may not be consistent with the traditional signaling hypothesis of dividend policy...|$|E
40|$|We {{examine whether}} {{corporate}} payout policy responds to changing investor tastes for non-dividend over dividend-paying stocks following {{an increase in}} housing prices. Exploiting the cross-regional dispersion in housing prices growth within the U.

Designed to generate sustained growth in the long term, the Fund offers investor benefits such as transparency, liquidity, and no leverage. The Fund invests in stocks with dividend yields ranging from 4% to 6%, particularly consumer staples with noteworthy defensive attributes. The Fund generates premium income by writing covered calls, which limits potential downside in the event of equity market decline. At the time of the announcement, the Castlestone Equity High Yield & Premium Income Fund included semi-monopolistic assets with relatively inelastic demand. Early portfolio stocks include HSBC, AstraZeneca, and Sydney Airport. The Fund connects investors with a variety of high <b>dividend</b> yield and <b>premium</b> income strategies, many of which were offered by stable, large capitalisation companies.

40|$|The Hidden Cost of Buying on the Dividend Pay Date On the {{day that}} {{dividends}} are paid we find a significant positive mean abnormal return, followed by a reversal that negates most of this price appreciation. This temporary dividend pay date effect has grown in magnitude since the 1970 ’s, and is concentrated among high dividend yield stocks that offer dividend reinvestment plans (DRIPs). Since the mid- 1990 s, these stocks yield a mean abnormal return close to 0. 5 % on the dividend pay date. This temporary inflation is larger in magnitude for stocks subject to greater limits to arbitrage. Quarterly profits from a trading strategy to exploit this anomaly are economically significant, and positively related to time series movements in market sentiment, transaction costs, the <b>dividend</b> <b>premium,</b> and the VIX.

40|$|This study {{compares the}} cash {{dividend}} policy of Chinese firms listed in Hong Kong {{and on the}} Mainland. It shows that, in both groups, firms that have higher managerial membership on the board tend to pay lower cash dividends. The relation is stronger in Mainland-listed firms, indicating that managers' influence on the board creates more serious agency problems. This study further shows that ownership concentration of Mainland-listed firms tends to weaken the association between managerial membership {{on the board and}} lower cash dividends, suggesting that concentrated ownership in the Mainland reduces the agency cost. Finally, this study shows that there is a price premium attaching to dividend payout of HK-listed Chinese firms, but there is no such premium in the Mainland market. Further, the same <b>dividend</b> <b>premium</b> is also observed in local firms listed in Hong Kong. Taken together, this study indicates that the pricing mechanism of Hong Kong's equity market appears to encourage managers of HK-listed firms to pay dividends. The same mechanism is not found to exist in the Mainland market. This difference helps to explain the finding that the controlling shareholders of HK-listed firms take a less active role in dividend policy than those of their peers on the Mainland. Thus, Hong Kong's equity market seems to provide a mechanism that can be used by Chinese firms listed there. ...|$|E
40|$|The first essay (Chapter 2) investigates debt-financed share repurchases. We {{find that}} debt-financed share buybacks {{generate}} positive short-term and long-run abnormal stock returns. Leveraged buyback firms have more debt capacity and lower growth prospects ex ante, increase leverage and reduce investments more sharply ex post than cash-financed buyback firms. Firms that are over-levered ex-ante {{are associated with}} lower returns and real investments following leveraged buybacks. The lower announcement returns are concentrated on firms with weaker corporate governance. Leveraged buybacks also have lower completion rates than cashfinanced buybacks. The evidence is consistent with leveraged buybacks enabling firms to optimize their leverage, on average benefiting shareholders. The benefits decrease with a firm’s leverage ex ante. The second essay (Chapter 3) studies {{the effect of the}} Supreme Court landmark Citizens United decision on how firms adjust their political activism under the constraints imposed on them by institutional investors. The essay shows that firms with more political connections have lower announcement returns, which are concentrated in firms with high institutional ownership. Furthermore, firms headquartered in states with corporate campaign contribution bans before Citizens United have relatively fewer state political connections afterwards. This result is concentrated in firms with low institutional ownership. The evidence is consistent with institutional investors’ preference to not use the new avenue of political activism. The third essay (Chapter 4) tests the dividend catering theory proposed by Baker and Wurgler (2004 b) by using the Internet search volume for dividend-related keywords as a direct measure of investors’ dividend sentiment. We find that firms initiate or increase dividends when the dividend sentiment is stronger. These effects are concentrated on firms located in high dividend sentiment states. They are robust after controlling for firm characteristics, risk, and the <b>dividend</b> <b>premium.</b> Our results are consistent with managers catering to investor’s time-varying demand for dividendpaying stocks...|$|E

40|$|The European Project Solvency II {{is devoted}} to the {{appraisal}} of a Solvency Capital Requirement that should capture the overall risk profile of insurance companies. In this framework there is a growing need to develop so-called internal risk models to get accurate estimates of liabilities. In the context of non-life insurance, it is crucial to correctly assess risk from different sources, such as underwriting risk with particular reference to premium, reserving and catastrophe risks. In particular the underwriting cycle, providing additional volatility, can lead to considerable capital requirement. In fact in adverse development of financial positions, company’s management typically tends to raise premium rates or reinsurance, whereas otherwise it increases <b>dividends</b> or reduces <b>premium</b> rates. A correct analysis of this phenomena is also significant to understand the evolution of the reserving cycle, which is often correlated, with a lag period, with the underwriting cycle; in fact, it has been ascertained the tendency of insurers to over-estimate technical reserves during the hard part of the cycle when loss ratios are low and under-estimate these reserves in the opposite case. The aim {{of this paper is to}} correctly model the underwriting cycle for non-life insurance companies, also taking into account differences between LoB in the Italian market, especially for the heavines...|$|R
40|$|The 1987 {{stock market}} crash {{occurred}} with minimal impact on observable economic variables (e. g., consumption), yet dramatically and permanently changed {{the shape of the}} implied volatility curve for equity index options. Here, we propose a general equilibrium model that captures many salient features of the U. S. equity and options markets before, during, and after the crash. The representative agent is endowed with Epstein-Zin preferences and the aggregate dividend and consumption processes are driven by a persistent stochastic growth variable that can jump. In reaction to a market crash, the agent updates her beliefs about the distribution of the jump component. We identify a realistic calibration of the model that matches the prices of shortmaturity at-the-money and deep out-of- the-money S&P 500 put options, as well as the prices of individual stock options. Further, the model generates a steep shift in the implied volatility 'smirk' for S&P 500 options after the 1987 crash. This 'regime shift' occurs in spite of a minimal impact on observable macroeconomic fundamentals. Finally, the model's implications are consistent with the empirical properties of <b>dividends,</b> the equity <b>premium,</b> as well as the level and standard deviation of the risk-free rate. Overall, our findings show {{that it is possible to}} reconcile the stylized properties of the equity and option markets in the framework of rational expectations, consistent with the notion that these two markets are integrated...|$|R
