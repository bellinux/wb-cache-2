5|$|We {{went into}} the booth to record the song. She {{originally}} {{wanted to do a}} Mike Skinner thing, rapping the verse and singing the chorus. But <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> her to sing it all, and she just made up the whole melody on the spot, and sang this amazing solo. At that moment I realised that this girl has a really special gift.|$|E
5|$|That night <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> the Mother of God {{what was}} to become of me. Then she came to me holding two crowns, one white, the other red. She asked me if I was willing to accept either of these crowns. The white one meant that I should persevere in purity, and the red that I should become a martyr. I said that I would accept them both.|$|E
5|$|After {{the liberation}} of Ethiopia, Emperor Haile Selassie <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> the United States, the United Kingdom, and France to help him to {{establish}} an airline {{as part of his}} modernisation effort. According to the BBC News {{it is possible that the}} Emperor intended the creation of a quality national airline to help dispel impressions of Ethiopian poverty. In 1945, the Ethiopian government began negotiations with both Transcontinental Air Transport and Western Air Express (later merged into TWA). On 8 September 1945, TWA signed an agreement with the American historian and foreign affairs advisor to Ethiopia John H. Spencer to establish a commercial aviation company in Ethiopia.|$|E

5|$|Calvert, {{a former}} high {{official}} {{in the government of}} King James <b>I,</b> <b>asked</b> the Privy Council for permission to build a colony, to be called Carolina, on land south of the Virginia settlements in area of the modern-day North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. Claiborne arrived soon afterwards and expressed the concerns of Virginia that its territorial integrity was being threatened. He was joined in his protests by a group of London merchants who planned to build a sugar colony in the same area. Claiborne, still intent on his own project, received a royal trading commission through one of his London supporters in 1631, one which granted him the right to trade with the natives on all lands in the mid-Atlantic where there was not already a patent in effect.|$|E
5|$|Family feud: According to Zonaras, Odaenathus' nephew misbehaved {{during a}} lion hunt; {{he made the}} first attack and killed the animal {{to the dismay of}} the king. Odaenathus warned the nephew who ignored the warning and {{repeated}} the act twice causing the king to deprive him of his horse which is a great insult in the East. The nephew threatened Odaenathus and was put in chains as a result; Hairan <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> his father to forgive his cousin and his request was granted but as the king was drinking, the nephew approached him with a sword and killed him along with Hairan I. The bodyguard immediately executed the nephew.|$|E
5|$|Globocnik and I {{were talking}} about Operation Reinhard, which was in full effect {{following}} Heydrich's murder, and also the construction of Sobibor and Treblinka. I know <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him about Höss, who was also standing there and had been summoned by Himmler regarding logistics or something regarding the new camp (Auschwitz). Then Globocnik mentioned to me and Kaltenbrunner that Lidice had been cleared, and all the Jews and Czechs had been dealt with. I noticed that this young pilot, who I later learned was Marseille, must have overheard, and I debated whether I should go over and say something to him. I decided against it.|$|E

Did <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> to stick fast {{in the very first}} chimney of all, because it was so shamefully clogged up with soot? Did <b>I</b> <b>ask</b> to stay here--I don't know how long--a hundred years, I do believe, and never get my pipe, nor my beer, nor nothing fit for a beast, let alone a man?" ...|$|R

5|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{him not to}} go {{into that}} field, that you were going there. He laughed at the idea of being {{restricted}} to any locality and said he intended to go whether I aided him or not. I was anxious to secure the cooperation of such a worker as an honor to my corps. I could not be responsible for the field he selected in as much as I pay him no salary and a portion of his expenses. You will see therefore that while it is not a pleasant thing to work in competition with others it seems almost a necessity. You can sympathize.|$|E
5|$|Reaching the cascade, {{or rather}} cataract, the roaring {{of which had}} a long time {{announced}} its vicinity, my soul was hurried by the falls into a new train of reflections. The impetuous dashing of the rebounding torrent from the dark cavities which mocked the exploring eye, produced an equal activity in my mind: my thoughts darted from earth to heaven, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> myself why I was chained to life and its misery? Still the tumultuous emotions this sublime object excited, were pleasurable; and, viewing it, my soul rose, with renewed dignity, above its cares – grasping at immortality – it seemed as impossible to stop the current of my thoughts, as of the always varying, still the same, torrent before me – I stretched out my hand to eternity, bounding over the dark speck of life to come.|$|E
5|$|Yesterday, as my orderly {{was holding}} my horse, <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{him where he}} was from. He said he was from Hawaii! He {{proved to be a}} full-blood Kanaka, by the name of Kealoha, who came from the Islands last year. There is also another, by the name of Kaiwi, who lived near Judge Smith's, who left the Islands last July. I enjoyed seeing them very much and we had a good jabber in kanaka. Kealoha is a private in the 41st Regiment US Colored Troops, and Kaiwi is a Private in the 28th U.S.C.T., in the pioneer corps. Both are good men and seemed glad to have seen me.|$|E

25|$|Orlov {{was very}} {{protective}} of his bloodstock, and would sell only geldings (castrated stallions). Even when Tsar Alexander <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> Orlov {{to sell him}} several stallions, Orlov only agreed to sell geldings. This rule was maintained for twenty years after Orlov's death. Later, when the Khrenovsky stud farm belonged to the Russian Crown, Trotters were then openly sold to private stud-owners.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{him what}} work he wanted done. He wanted two warts (moles) removed {{on the right}} lower {{forehead}} between the eyes and one at the left angle, outer angle of the left eye; wanted a depression of the nose filled in; a scar; a large one {{to the left of}} the median line of the upper lip excised, wanted his dimples removed and wanted the angle of the mouth drawn up. He didn't say anything about the fingers that day to me.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} said by some that <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> for too much. Perhaps so. You tell me -- what quality of {{leadership}} would ask too little? What sort of leadership would be content merely to maintain a standard of living that for so long has been so meager for so many? The shame upon me and my administration {{would have been in}} not struggling for something better. Today, I am not ashamed..... The most meaningful measurement of progress is that certain things are no longer acceptable to us as a people.|$|E

25|$|Scates' {{interest}} in volleyball began when his college football coach required his players {{to try out}} for a volleyball team to stay in shape during the off season. Scates did not make the team roster, but a teammate of his on the basketball team not only made the team, but was the best player on the floor. “So <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> him where he learned to play,” Scates said. “He told me State Beach in Santa Monica. So I decided to learn how to play.” Scates was soon a regular at State Beach.|$|E
25|$|When <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> {{a friend}} who worked for Fat where they think the leak came from, they pinpointed it to one {{specific}} person from a specific magazine (again, not AP) who had been begging them to hear the record.

25|$|In 2006, I made {{a serious}} error in {{judgment}} and conducted {{myself in a}} way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs. I recognized my mistake and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman, and <b>I</b> <b>asked</b> for her forgiveness. Although I was honest in every painful detail with my family, I did not tell the public. When a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story, I used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it. But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough...|$|E
