25|$|<b>Hausdorff</b> <b>dimension</b> is {{a concept}} in {{mathematics}} introduced in 1918 by mathematician Felix Hausdorff, and {{it serves as a}} measure of the local size of a space, taking into account the distance between its points. Applying its mathematical formalisms provides that the <b>Hausdorff</b> <b>dimension</b> of a single point is zero, of a line is 1, and of a square is 2, of a cube is 3. That is, for sets of points that define a smooth shape or a shape that has a small number of corners—the shapes of traditional geometry and science—the <b>Hausdorff</b> <b>dimension</b> is an integer agreeing with a dimension corresponding to its topology. However, formalisms have also been developed that allow calculation of the dimension of other less simple objects, where, based solely on its properties of scaling and self-similarity, one is led to the conclusion that particular objects—including fractals—have non-integer Hausdorff dimensions. Because of the significant technical advances made by Abram Samoilovitch Besicovitch allowing computation of dimensions for highly irregular sets, this dimension is also commonly referred to as the Hausdorff–Besicovitch dimension.|$|E

25|$|In {{mathematical}} terms, the <b>Hausdorff</b> <b>dimension</b> generalizes {{the notion}} of the dimension of a real vector space. That is, the <b>Hausdorff</b> <b>dimension</b> of an n-dimensional inner product space equals n. This underlies the earlier statement that the <b>Hausdorff</b> <b>dimension</b> of a point is zero, of a line is one, etc., and that irregular sets can have noninteger Hausdorff dimensions. For instance, the Koch curve summarized earlier is constructed from an equilateral triangle; in each iteration, its component line segments are divided into 3 segments of unit length, the newly created middle segment is used as the base of a new equilateral triangle that points outward, and this base segment is then deleted to leave a final object from the iteration of unit length of 4. That is, after the first iteration, each original line segment has been replaced with N=4, where each self-similar copy is 1/S = 1/3 as long as the original. Stated another way, we have taken an object with Euclidean dimension, D, and reduced its linear scale by 1/3 in each direction, so that its length increases to N=SD. This equation is easily solved for D, yielding the ratio of logarithms (or natural logarithms) appearing in the figures, and giving—in the Koch and other fractal cases—non-integer dimensions for these objects.|$|E

40|$|International audienceFine {{regularity}} of stochastic processes {{is usually}} measured {{in a local}} way by local Hölder exponents and in a global way by fractal dimensions. Following a previous work of Adler, we connect these two concepts for multiparameter Gaussian random fields. More precisely, we prove that almost surely the <b>Hausdorff</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the range and the graph in any ball B(t_ 0,ρ) are bounded from above using the local Hölder exponent at t_ 0. We define the deterministic local sub-exponent of Gaussian processes, which allows to obtain an almost sure lower bound for these <b>dimensions.</b> Moreover, the <b>Hausdorff</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the sample path on an open interval are controlled almost surely by the minimum of the local exponents. Then, we apply these generic results to the cases of the multiparameter fractional Brownian motion, the multifractional Brownian motion whose regularity function H is irregular and the generalized Weierstrass function, whose <b>Hausdorff</b> <b>dimensions</b> were unknown so far...|$|R
25|$|The Hausdorff {{measure is}} a {{generalization}} of the Lebesgue measure that {{is useful for}} measuring the subsets of Rn of lower dimensions than n, like submanifolds, for example, surfaces or curves in R³ and fractal sets.

25|$|As a group, these {{criteria}} form guidelines for excluding certain cases, {{such as those}} that may be self-similar without having other typically fractal features.

For the Sierpinski triangle, doubling its side creates 3 copies of itself.
