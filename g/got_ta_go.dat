40|$|This book is {{open access}} under a CC-BY license. Policy-making to address grand {{challenges}} faces greater complexity {{than any previous}} project of modernization. Future scenarios are haunted by uncertainty and there is real ambivalence as to the values that policy should strive for. In this situation decision-makers look to research and innovation to provide answers and solutions. But neither can the great transitions ahead be planned by science, nor will conventional methods of innovation bring such transitions about. A turn to interactive governance is therefore underway with policy-makers and citizens becoming increasingly involved in processes of deliberating futures. Technology Assessment (TA) {{is the art of}} structuring such processes. <b>TA</b> <b>goes</b> beyond traditional expert policy analysis by systematically combining a multi-disciplinary evidence base with participatory approaches to policy deliberation. TA thus seeks to act as a hub for serious and transparent dialogue between policy, industry, science, and society about the challenges ahead and the available options for overcoming them responsibly. This volume offers an up-to-date account of the expansion of technology assessment capacities across new European member states. The contributions of this volume are written by leading European researchers and practitioners in technology assessment (TA) and are based on the PACITA (Parliaments and Civil Society in Technology Assessment) project...|$|R
30|$|Further {{problems}} related to our distributed top-k monitoring are distributed one-time top-k queries [4, 5, 7]. Fagin et al. [7] examined the Threshold Algorithm (TA) and considered both exact answers and approximate answers with relative error tolerance. <b>TA</b> <b>goes</b> down the sorted lists in parallel, one position at a time, and calculates {{the sum of the}} values at that position across all the lists. The sum of the values is called threshold. TA stops when it finds k objects whose values are higher than the threshold value. Cao and Wang [5] proposed an efficient algorithm called three-phase uniform threshold (TPUT), which reduces network bandwidth consumption by pruning away ineligible objects and terminates in three round trips regardless of data input. Based on this work, Michel et al. [16] presented a novel algorithmic framework, called KLEE, which makes a strong case for approximate top-k algorithms over widely distributed data sources. It extends the TPUT algorithm and affords the query-initiating peer the flexibility to trade-off result quality and expected performance and to trade-off the number of communication phases engaged during query execution versus network bandwidth performance. Unfortunately, these studies are interested in algorithms that can obtain the initial top-k result efficiently and provide top-k result to one-time queries. Our study focuses on monitoring whether the top-k result has changed after an initial answer has been obtained.|$|R

He leaves, distraught, accompanied by his friend since childhood, the seamstress Helen Chao, who also grew up in America and deeply loves Wang Ta. Ta becomes drunk in his misery over Linda, and Helen ends up letting him stay for the night in her apartment. She sings [...] "Love Look Away", about her unrequited love. In the morning, Mei Li comes to deliver a burned coat for Helen to mend, and becomes distressed when she discovers Wang Ta's clothing in Helen's kitchen. When Wang Ta wakes up (seconds after Mei Li leaves), he still does not notice Helen's affections, even as she pleads for him to stay, and he leaves quickly. He goes to speak with Mei Li, now realizing that she is a better match for him than Linda Low, only to have Mei Li reject him, saying that she once loved him, but not anymore. She and her father leave Master Wang's house and pursue the marriage contract between Mei Li and Sammy Fong. This is unfortunate in that Sammy has already proposed to Linda, but now will be unable to marry her (the contract is binding). Before the wedding, Wang <b>Ta</b> <b>goes</b> to see Mei Li, and they both realize that they are deeply in love with one another.
