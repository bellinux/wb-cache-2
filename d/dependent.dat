5|$|The Director of <b>Dependent</b> States (Dian shuguo 典屬國), whose salary-rank was 2,000-dan, was {{responsible}} for embassies to foreign countries and nomadic peoples along Han's borders and the annual exchange of hostages—usually foreign princes—submitted to the Han court. <b>Dependent</b> States (Shuguo 屬國) were first established in 121 BC and composed mostly non-Han-Chinese nomadic tribes and confederations who surrendered after negotiation or armed conflict and accepted Han suzerainty. They served as a buffer between Han territory and hostile tribes, such as the Xiongnu, and {{as a means to}} quell tribes in the Ordos Desert. The Han court appointed a Commandant (Duwei 都尉), also known as Chief Commandant, ranked Equivalent to 2,000-dan, to govern the non-Han-Chinese populations of each <b>Dependent</b> State. The Director of <b>Dependent</b> States' title was abolished in 28 BC; his duties and his subordinates, the Commandants, became the responsibilities of the Minister Herald. The Protectorate of the Western Regions, established in 60 BC, which conducted foreign affairs with the oasis city-states in the Tarim Basin of Central Asia, was not the responsibility of the Director of <b>Dependent</b> States.|$|E

5|$|There are {{at least}} two {{different}} <b>dependent</b> glyphs used for the concept of a guiding star. The generic Polynesian term is Ihu-ku (Hawaiian) which translates to “standing above the bow”. This concept is associated with the ‘phallic’ <b>dependent</b> glyph. For a specific guiding star used to make landfall on an island, the Polynesian term is hoku ai’aina, which is translated to “stars which ate, ruled the land”. This concept is referred to with the ‘hand’ <b>dependent</b> glyph.|$|E
5|$|There are few {{compound}} words, {{but lots}} of derivations. The grammar employs a mixture of head and <b>dependent</b> marking: both agent and patient are marked on the predicate and the possessor is marked on nouns, while <b>dependent</b> noun phrases inflect for case.

5|$|A {{national}} recession greatly {{affected the}} city's economy in 1982, as areas of Texas and Oklahoma heavily <b>dependent</b> on oil suffered the freefall in gas prices {{due to a}} glut, and a mass exodus of oil industries.

By 1992, the state's economy had fully recovered, but leaders worked to expand into sectors unrelated to oil and energy.|$|E

5|$|Mass {{transfer}} diffusion {{takes place}} in the case where adparticle sources and traps such as kinks, steps, and vacancies are present. Instead of being <b>dependent</b> only on the jump potential barrier Ediff, diffusion in this regime is now also <b>dependent</b> on the formation energy of mobile adparticles. The exact nature of the diffusion environment therefore plays a role in dictating the diffusion rate, since the formation energy of an adparticle is different for each type of surface feature as is described in the Terrace Ledge Kink model.|$|E

40|$|The {{linguistic}} {{notions of}} head and <b>dependents</b> (arguments and adjuncts) {{are central to}} essentially all theories of syntax. Word order facts are typically stated by defining order relations between the <b>dependents</b> and their head. An important proposal of transformational grammar is that heads can be mobile [...] i. e., the ordering of a head and its <b>dependents</b> can be described not only by relating the <b>dependents</b> to the head, but also by independently situating the head in a predetermined "grid" [...] the system of functional projections and X 0 -schema of the Barriers framework of Chomsky (1986) [...] and then arranging the <b>dependents</b> {{with respect to this}} grid. This head mobility has given syntacticians an important descriptive tool in tackling word-order phenomena such as Germanic V 2.

40|$|We {{examine the}} {{question}} of which household members should con-sume medical services, and in what quantities, by using Japanese household-level data. We employ two key concepts, health risk and income risk, and investigate whether family heads or <b>dependents</b> bear these risks. Health risk is the risk that a household member falls ill, while income risk is the risk that future household income decreases. We find that both heads and <b>dependents</b> make fewer visits to doctors as household size increases. We also find that only <b>dependents</b> visited doctors less frequently following the reform {{of the public health}} insur-ance system, which raised the co-payment rate of family heads from 10 % to 20 %. These findings imply that heads and <b>dependents</b> share health risk but <b>dependents</b> bear income risk...|$|R
