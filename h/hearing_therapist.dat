40|$|INTRODUÇÃO-Este trabalho surgiu da necessidade de refletir sobre o sentido do erro no campo da linguagem escrita na Fonoaudiologia; visto que tal área tem recebido maior atenção de pesquisadores dada à diversidade de aspectos observados na constante demanda clínica. O que ocorre é que crescentemente são feitos encaminhamentos, prioritariamente por professores que trabalham com crianças em idade escolar - a partir dos 07 anos de idade - que apresentam dificuldades de aprendizagem. É possível notar que o encaminhamento escolar acontece, geralmente, devido à constatação de erros nas produções de tais crianças. O que podemos observar no contexto clínico é que em muitos casos os professores encontram dificuldades em como lidar com o aparecimento do erro em sala de aula e, por isso, a necessidade dos encaminhamentos a profissionais como os fonoaudiólogos que enfocam seu trabalho na linguagem e, neste caso em particular, com a linguagem escrita. OBJETIVO-O objetivo desse trabalho foi {{investigar}} o sentido do erro na escrita de crianças na perspectiva do fonoaudiólogo e do professor, além de buscar as possíveis articulações existentes entre tais visões. MÉTODO-Para tanto foi realizada uma pesquisa qualitativa utilizando a técnica de grupo focal com um grupo de fonoaudiólogos e um grupo de professores. RESULTADO-A pesquisa trouxe como resultado que em suas interpretações que os fonoaudiólogos procuram interpretar o erro numa visão mais ampla e conceitual como encontramos em práticas discursivas apoiadas no conceito de letramento, enquanto que os professores ainda direcionam seu olhar para o erro enquanto alvo, falha reduzindo a escrita em atividades estritamente escolares. CONCLUSÃO-Esperamos que essa pesquisa possibilite um novo olhar para os erros na escrita de crianças contribuindo tanto para o fonoaudiólogo quanto para o professor. INTRODUCTION-This {{work results}} from the necessity of reflecting about the errors committed {{in the field of}} written language of speech and <b>hearing</b> <b>therapist</b> once this area has been demanding more attention from the researchers due to the diversity of aspects that are observed in constant clinical demand. The fact is that we note an increase in the leading of patients done mainly by teachers who work with children in school age - from 7 years old on - that present difficulty in learning. It's possible to note that when the patient is leaded by the school, it's usually because of errors committed by the children in their production. We can observe in the clinical context that in many cases the teachers find difficult to deal with the appearance of errors inside the classroom and this way they decide to lead the children to a professional speech and <b>hearing</b> <b>therapist</b> like a that focus its work in the language, and particularly in this case in the written language. OBJECTIVE-The objective of this work was to investigate the sense of the errors in the written language of the children taking into account the perspective of the speech and <b>hearing</b> <b>therapist</b> and the teacher, besides looking to find possible articulations that may arise in both visions. METHOD-This way, we carried out a qualitative research where we utilized the technique of focal group with the presence of speech and <b>hearing</b> <b>therapist</b> and teachers. RESULT- The research brought as a result that the speech and <b>hearing</b> <b>therapist</b> tend to interpret the errors in a more wide and conceptual vision, such as we find in discoursive practices supported on the "letramento" concept, while the teachers still direct their look to the error as an "target", a fault reducing the writing in strictly school activities. CONCLUSION- We hope this search to make possible a new look to the errors in the speech and <b>hearing</b> <b>therapist</b> speech and <b>hearing</b> <b>therapist</b> written language of children and also to contribute to professionals like and teachers...|$|E
40|$|Different {{forms of}} {{relaxing}} methods {{can be used}} in rehabilitation for individuals with tinnitus and Ménièré’s disease. Research continues to find convincing proof of effects from the different methods. This study presents methods of relaxing, massage and Mindfulness, as possible complementary rehabilitation tools. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate opinions about relaxing from professionals working with hearing care. A qualitative approach with phenomenological influence was chosen for the study. Through interviews data was mapped from four different areas of skilled labour as physiotherapist, <b>hearing</b> <b>therapist,</b> welfare officer and audiologist. The result shows seven categories treating: Relaxing, Patients problem, Uncertainness/Lack, Method, Response, Cooperation and Joy of Working. These categories show that the informants experience a need of relaxing as a method to work with. However, some of them experience a lack of enough knowledge to be able to use relaxing in their work. Those who use relaxing in their work, do both in groups and individually. The response from patients is positive since increased body awareness and acceptance are important in the relation to functional disability. Increased cooperation between different areas of skilled labour and a personal interest are of great importance...|$|E
40|$|Two {{types of}} monosyllabic speech {{discrimination}} training and {{two types of}} meaningful disyllabic speech discrimination training were conducted in a man with chronic Wernicke 2 ̆ 7 s aphasia. The effects of training on speech discrimination ability and auditory comprehension were investigated. The patient was a 48 -year-old, right-handed male who started training about 4 years after putaminal hemorrhage. The training comprised a daily home task {{for a total of}} about 4 months, and the training results were measured once a week by a speech, language <b>hearing</b> <b>therapist.</b> In the monosyllabic speech discrimination training, a significant increase was seen in speech discrimination ability both in training with and without using written characters. In the speech discrimination training with meaningful disyllabic words, a better effect of training was seen with a method using oral reading of Kanji characters compared with a method of listening to sounds and comparing them with written characters. In an investigation of the effect using a Test of Lexical Processing in Aphasia for auditory comprehension, no change was observed with monosyllabic speech discrimination training; however, {{a significant increase in the}} number of correct answers was observed with speech discrimination training using meaningful disyllabic words...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} use of constructionist therapy with a {{reflecting}} team of <b>hearing</b> <b>therapists</b> seeing deaf clients. Using findings from two in-depth interviews, postsession reflections, and {{a review of the}} literature, we propose that this model has the potential to cater to the diversity of the lived experiences of deaf people, and also to address issues of power and tensions between medical, social and cultural models of deafness. The interviews found there was real value in sharing multiple perspectives between the reflecting team of <b>hearing</b> <b>therapists</b> and these deaf clients. In addition, the clients reported feeling safe and comfortable with this model of counseling. Other information that emerged from the interviews supports previous findings regarding consistency in interpreting and the importance of <b>hearing</b> <b>therapists</b> having an understanding of the distinctions between Deaf and hearing worlds. As the first investigation of its kind in Australia, this paper provides a map for therapists to incorporate reflecting teams with interpreters, deaf clients and <b>hearing</b> <b>therapists.</b> The value of this paper also lies in providing a much needed platform for future research into counseling outcomes and the efficacy of this constructionist model of therapy...|$|R

40|$|The {{provision}} {{of mental health}} services for Deaf people in the United Kingdom is mostly from secondary and tertiary health care that caters for the moderate to severe spectrum of mental health issues with little provision from primary care such as psychological therapies. Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) was launched in 2008 and found not to be accessible for Deaf people; this resulted in a new BSL IAPT service being set up in 2011. Deaf people were not able to access the BSL IAPT service because of how each Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) commission services for their local population. Commissioners do not have evidence to show the impact on Deaf people who access therapy with an interpreter versus with a Deaf therapist, and the literature on Deaf people’s experiences in psychological therapies is very limited. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the BSL users’ relationships with their therapists by exploring their experiences of therapy alliance in Deaf/Deaf therapy and Hearing/Deaf/Interpreter therapy and to identify best practice for BSL users’ who require psychological therapy. This qualitative study uses Smith, Flowers and Larkin’s Interpretative Phenomenology Analysis (IPA) approach. Data were collected from 8 participants (7 females and 1 male), who formed two groups: Group 1 had experienced therapy with a Deaf therapist and Group 2 had experienced therapy with a <b>hearing</b> <b>therapist</b> via an interpreter. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with all participants to explore their experiences of psychological therapies. Data were analysed from transcripts and these were coded using NVIVO where themes emerged. The findings identified 6 broad themes along with 12 overarching sub-themes such as translation problems, the lack of cultural competency, holding back information, issues with there being three people in the room, and feeling safe/unsafe in therapy situations. Some participants reported they use SSE instead of BSL due to the interpreter not capturing the essence of their disclosure. It seems that the client-interpreter-therapist triad and the therapist’s lack of cultural competency causes complications such as therapeutic rupture and making clients feel insecure, frustrated and vulnerable. The benefits of having a Deaf therapist were also apparent, their ability to share their similar experiences, making clients feel validated and less isolated. Combining cultural competency with the sharing of experiences appears to promote a strong therapeutic alliance. Some of the findings suggest that Deaf people receiving therapy from a <b>hearing</b> <b>therapist</b> via an interpreter encounter negative experiences that are minimised or eliminated in the context of receiving therapy directly from a Deaf therapist. These findings are of importance as they contribute to the evidence around issues that can arise from the triad and the benefits of direct therapy for Deaf people. The study identified four recommendations for further research. (1) perspectives of Deaf people regarding Deaf therapists, (2) to investigate if the interpreters process of strategic omission removes the essence of the Deaf client, (3) look at the cause and effect on having a third person in the room and (4) explore the views of Deaf people who have experienced both hearing and Deaf therapists using the same approach as this study...|$|E
40|$|In Australia, {{there is}} only one, newly established, {{dedicated}} mental health service catering specifically for the signing *Deaf community. It is staffed by four part-time hearing professionals and based in Brisbane. There are currently no Deaf psychologists or psychiatrists {{and there is no}} valid or reliable empirical evidence on outcomes for Deaf people accessing specialised or mainstream mental health services. Further compounding these issues, is {{the fact that there are}} no sign language versions of the most common standardised mental health or psychological instruments available to clinicians in Australia. Contemporary counselling literature is acknowledging the role of the therapeutic alliance and the impact of 'common factors' on therapeutic outcomes. However, these issues are complicated by the relationship between the Deaf client and the <b>hearing</b> <b>therapist</b> being a cross-cultural exchange. The disability model of deafness is contentious and few professionals in Australia have the requisite knowledge and understanding of deafness from a cultural perspective to attend to the therapeutic relationship with this in mind. Consequently, Deaf people are severely disadvantaged by the current lack of services, resources and skilled professionals in the field of deafness and psychology in this country. The primary aim of the following program of research has been to propose a model for culturally affirmative service delivery and to provide clinicians with tools to evaluate the effect of their therapeutic work with Deaf people seeking mental health treatment. The research document is presented as a thesis by publication and comprises four specific objectives formulated in response to the lack of existing services and resources. The first objective was to explore the use of social constructionist counselling techniques and a reflecting team with Deaf clients, hearing therapists and an interpreter. Following the establishment of a pilot counselling clinic, indepth semi-structured interviews were conducted with two long-term clients following the one year pilot of this service. These interviews generated recommendations for the development of a new 'enriched' model of counselling to be implemented and evaluated in later stages of the research program. The second objective was to identify appropriate psychometric measures that could be translated into Australian Sign Language (Auslan) for research into efficacy, effectiveness and counselling outcomes. Two instruments were identified as potentially suitable; the Outcome Rating Scale (ORS), a measure of global functioning, and the Session Rating Scale (SRS), a measure of therapeutic alliance. A specialised team of bi-lingual and bi-cultural interpreters, native signers and the primary researcher for this thesis, produced the ORS-Auslan and the SRS-Auslan in DVD format, using the translation and back-translation process. The third objective was to establish the validity and reliability of these new Auslan measures based on normative data from the Deaf community. Data from the ORS-Auslan was collected from one clinical and one non-clinical sample of Deaf people. Statistical analyses revealed that the ORS-Auslan is reliable, valid and adequately distinguishes between clinical and non-clinical presentations. Furthermore, construct validity has been established using a yet to be validated sign language version of the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale- 21 items (DASS- 21), providing a platform for further research using the DASS- 21 with Deaf people. The fourth objective was to evaluate counselling outcomes following the implementation of an enriched counselling service, based on the findings generated by the first objective, and using the newly translated Auslan measures. A second university counselling clinic was established and implemented over the course of one year. Practice-based evidence guided the research and the ORS-Auslan and the SRS-Auslan were administered at every session and provided outcome data on Deaf clients' global functioning. Data from six clients over the course of ten months indicated that this culturally affirmative model was an effective approach for these six clients. This is the first time that outcome data have been collected in Australia using valid and reliable Auslan measures to establish preliminary evidence for the effectiveness of any therapeutic intervention for clinical work with adult, signing Deaf clients. The research generated by this thesis contributes theoretical knowledge, professional development and practical resources that can be used by a variety of mental health clinicians in the context of mental health service delivery to Deaf clients in Australia...|$|E

40|$|The {{predicted}} {{increase in}} adults over 65 will challenge {{health and social}} service providers. Productive ageing, where healthy older adults are encouraged {{to remain in the}} workforce for longer, may be a solution. One barrier to this solution may be the negative attitudes many people have towards older adults. Fishbein & Ajzen's, (1975) theory of reasoned action postulates that attitudes are based on beliefs or knowledge and can have an affect on how people behave. Attitudes may also be influenced by such factors as age, gender, experience and, most importantly, the attitudes and beliefs of significant others (subjective norms) (Fishbein & Ajzen, 1975. Hearing impairment is the third most limiting chronic condition for older adults (Chen, 1994). In the present study, 15 <b>Hearing</b> <b>therapists</b> and 30 private audiologists in New Zealand completed Palmore's (1998) Facts on Aging Quiz (FAQ), Kogan's (1961) Attitudes towards Old People Scale, a vignette measuring treatment intentions and subjective norms, and gave biographical data. It was hypothesized that audiologists would have higher knowledge levels (FAQ) and more positive attitudes (ATOP) than <b>hearing</b> <b>therapists.</b> Despite the differences in education, {{there were no significant differences}} between the two groups in FAQ scores. However, <b>hearing</b> <b>therapists</b> did have more positive attitudes towards older adults. Further analyses suggested that this was a function of gender and possibly education, with less-educated females having more positive attitudes. When considering the two professional groups together, those 40 years old and over had more positive attitudes than those less than 40 years old. It was also hypothesised that, based on the theory of reasoned action, positive attitudes will result in positive treatment (as measured by the vignette) and this relationship will be moderated by subjective norms. Subjective norms were not measurable using the vignette and were not investigated further. While all participants had positive attitudes these did not always result in the most appropriate treatment. It was concluded that a lack of specific gerontological knowledge resulted in less appropriate treatment rather than negative attitudes towards older adults...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: to {{investigate}} the qualification of the speech language and <b>hearing</b> <b>therapists</b> and their clinical performance with Augmentative and Alternative Communication. Methods: a descriptive, transversal, individual and contemporary study. Data were collected through a questionnaire, filled by twenty-four speech therapists, selected by a convenience sample. Content analysis was chosen for data study. Results: regarding access to the information media, all speech therapists in the sample presented the initiative to supply the absence of language training with Augmentative and Alternative Communication by different means. Regarding the dual focus on intervention, all speech therapists were favorable to this practice. However, according to experience, they reported resistance from the family, school and other therapists. The results showed {{two different types of}} introduction implementation and use of Augmentative and Alternative Communication, predominantly formed by strategies contemplating the pragmatic use of language through the contextualization of significant activities for the user. The other way used the Picture Exchange Communication System. Conclusion: the speech-language and <b>hearing</b> <b>therapists</b> in the present study inserted different interlocutors in the intervention, guided by implicit or explicit linguistic principles, by theoretical frameworks specific to the area of Augmentative and Alternative Communication knowledge, by global neuromotor elements and, finally, by principles of functionality and general wellness...|$|R
40|$|SummaryAimto {{review the}} {{literature}} on aging-related hearing loss and its current impacts. Literature reviewIn studies carried out in Brazil, presbycusis has been blamed for being the most frequent cause of hearing loss in the elderly, causing verbal communication impairment.

Subjects: We recruited the stroke patients with suspected stroke-related dysphagia who were referred to speech, language, and <b>hearing</b> <b>therapists</b> at the emergency hospital for a swallowing examination between March 2009 and March 2010. Method: Multivariate analyses were performed to identify variables significantly associated with thepossibility of oral intake. Results: The mean age of the patients was 76. 8 (SD 12. 7) years. A total of 158 patients suffered from ischemic stroke while 56 suffered from hemorrhagic stroke. At the point of discharge from the hospital, 107 patients (50. 0 %) resumed a regular diet.

40|$|ABSTRACT The Audiology {{profession}} in South Africa {{appears to be}} lacking direction. Many challenges to Audiology service delivery are said to exist. However, no official national investigation regarding the range of audiological services provided has been conducted. The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate at a national level, the demographics of Audiologists in SA, to conduct an audit of service delivery, and to identify issues impacting on audiology service delivery. Respondents were requested to indicate reasons for non-provision of audiology services. Research participants included all South African qualified Speech-Language and <b>Hearing</b> <b>Therapists,</b> Audiologists, Speech Therapist and community service graduates currently registered with the Health Professional Council of South Africa. A cross-sectional ex post facto, descriptive survey research design within the quantitative paradigm was selected. Descriptive statistics were utilised to analyse the data and were presented to display service delivery provided by respondents employed in the private and public sectors. Results: A significant difference in professional registration and practice was evident. The audit of service delivery revealed that the provision of advanced diagnostic audiology procedures, paediatric audiology services as well as rehabilitation services was significantly lacking. Audiology service delivery in both the public and private sector were analogous. The lack of equipment was a central reason for the non-provision of services amongst all respondents. Key issues influencing service delivery included the lack of knowledge by associated professionals and the public, delayed referrals, limited budgets, lack of staffing, and restrictions regarding advertisements. Conclusion: The profession of audiology in SA is under transition. The scope of audiology service delivery is slowing moving towards the implementation of advanced diagnostic audiology services however support from associated professionals is lacking. To this end the Audiology {{profession in}} SA must focus on advertisement and marketing regarding the range and clinical relevance of audiological services available. Future directions for the profession include the development of unified test protocols and norms, forming data bases, equipping audiology departments, and hosting a forum to discuss a vision of audiology services in SA...|$|R
40|$|O plano supraglótico representa uma importante dimensão na produção vocal, sendo de grande relevância sua caracterização na avaliação e conduta terapêutica de indivíduos disfônicos. OBJETIVO: Verificar se determinadas configurações glóticas se relacionam com ajustes específicos de trato vocal. Avaliar por meio da nasofibrolaringoscopia a freqüência dos ajustes do trato vocal supraglótico em mulheres disfônicas com nódulos, fendas e cistos. MÉTODO: Foram avaliadas 31 mulheres disfônicas, faixa etária entre 18 e 45 anos, com alteração vocal e diagnóstico de nódulos, fenda médioposterior e cisto e realizada avaliação resumida do sistema sensório-motor e oral e exames de videolaringoestroboscopia e nasofibrolaringoscopia. Três grupos distintos foram selecionados: pacientes com nódulos bilaterais, com fenda e com cisto, com configurações glóticas semelhantes.

40|$|Background: Tinnitus is {{associated}} with depression and anxiety disor- ders, severely and adversely affecting {{the quality of life}} and functional health status for some people. With the dearth of clinical psychologists embedded in audiology services and the cessation of training for <b>hearing</b> <b>therapists</b> in the UK, it is left to audiologists to meet the psychological needs of many patients with tinnitus. However, there is no universally standardized training or manualized intervention specifically for audiolo- gists across the whole UK public healthcare system and similar systems elsewhere across the world. Objectives: The primary aim of this scoping review was to catalog the components of psychological therapies for people with tinnitus, which have been used or tested by psychologists, so that they might inform the development of a standardized audiologist-delivered psy- chological intervention. Secondary aims of this article were to identify the types of psychological therapy for people with tinnitus, who were reported but not tested in any clinical trial, as well as the job roles of clinicians who delivered psychological therapy for people with tinnitus in the literature. Design: The authors searched the Cochrane Ear, Nose and Throat Disorders Group Trials Register; Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials; PubMed; EMBASE; CINAHL; LILACS; KoreaMed; IndMed; PakMediNet; CAB Abstracts; Web of Science; BIOSIS Previews; ISRCTN; ClinicalTrials. gov; IC-TRP; and Google Scholar. In addition, the authors searched the gray literature including conference abstracts, disserta- tions, and editorials. No records were excluded on the basis of controls used, outcomes reached, timing, setting, or study design (except for reviews—of the search results. Records were included in which a psy- chological therapy intervention was reported to address adults (≤ 18 years) tinnitus-related distress. No restrictive criteria were placed upon the term tinnitus. Records were excluded in which the intervention included biofeedback, habituation, hypnosis, or relaxation as necessary parts of the treatment. Results: A total of 5043 records were retrieved of which 64 were retained. Twenty-five themes of components that have been included within a psychological therapy were identified, including tinnitus educa- tion, psychoeducation, evaluation treatment rationale, treatment plan- ning, problem-solving behavioral intervention, thought identification, thought challenging, worry time, emotions, social comparison, inter- personal skills, self-concept, lifestyle advice, acceptance and defusion, mindfulness, attention, relaxation, sleep, sound enrichment, comorbid- ity, treatment reflection, relapse prevention, and common therapeutic skills. The most frequently reported psychological therapies were cogni- tive behavioral therapy, tinnitus education, and internet-delivered cogni- tive behavioral therapy. No records reported that an audiologist delivered any of these psychological therapies {{in the context of an}} empirical trial in which their role was clearly delineated from that of other clinicians. Conclusions: Scoping review methodology does not attempt to appraise the quality of evidence or synthesize the included records. Further research should therefore determine the relative importance of these dif- ferent components of psychological therapies from the perspective of the patient and the clinician...|$|R
40|$|Good {{infrastructure}} and equitable distribution of resources are critical factors in securing equal health care access to all. Poverty, food production and distribution, water, sanitation, housing, {{environmental protection and}} education all impact on health (Lee and Mills, 1983). Despite the multi-dimensional determinants of health and healthcare, {{one of the most}} noticeable challenges facing the health care system is that of human resources. Health care systems cannot function optimally without sufficient levels and adequate distribution of health care personnel. Brain drain in South Africa is one of the critical areas of concern according to the Health Minister (Poggenpoel, 2004). Recruitment and retention of health care workers within public health institutions {{is still one of the}} most critical challenges facing South Africa. Poor working conditions; limited consumable resources and mismanagement of facilities aggravate the problem of shortage of skilled health care personnel. Limited private practice (LPP) is seen as one of the many mechanisms to retain health care personnel. Limited Private Practice or moonlighting allows for government or state employees to perform private duties within certain time parameters. LPP is common in many developing countries, including South Africa. This study focuses on the health professionals engaging in limited private practice in South Africa. Remunerative Work Outside Public Sector (RWOPS) is potentially an alternative term used for LPP in South Africa. The study focuses on the evolutionary process of the RWOPS policy and explores the attitudes and perceptions of the health professionals and management at the Johannesburg Hospital with regards to the RWOPS policy. Policy documents, press releases, international studies and official documents collected through searches on the world-wide-web have provided the bases for the evolutionary process of the study. The perception and attitudes were determined through a selfadministered structured questionnaire. Participants were randomly selected from a list obtained from the Johannesburg Hospital Human Resource personnel. Some participants were selected using snowball sampling. A total of forty two questionnaires were handed out to the respective participants with feedback from thirty five participants. The questionnaire compromised of closed and open ended questions. The sample population consisted of the following participants: · Nursing personnel (these included nurses at all levels, professional nurses, senior nurses, chief nurses as well as representatives from DENOSA) · Doctors (all levels registrars, senior registrars, Head Of Department’s, consultants and reps from SAMA) · Management (the CEO and some human resource personnel responsible for processing the RWOPS applications) · Allied Health Professionals (all levels of physiotherapists, occupational therapists, pharmacists and the speech and <b>hearing</b> <b>therapists)</b> The results are presented graphically. The data was thematically analyzed allowing the researcher to identify the role of the key actors in the implementation process. The Walt and Gilson (1994) model was used to analyze and assess the RWOPS policy. A pilot study was conducted to determine if the validity and reliability of the questionnaire in determining the role, attitudes and perceptions of these key actors with regards to the RWOPS policy. The pilot study was included in the actual sample population. Management n= 2; doctors n= 11; nurses n= 15 and allied health n= 7 were the total number of respondents. Most individuals felt that a shortage of human resource was the most critical challenge. Most participants are not familiar with the RWOPS policy even though seventy seven percent of the participants answered yes to being familiar with the policy. The expectation from many participants was for them to receive substantial financial incentives through the policy. This relates the lack of knowledge on the policy terms. Participants also felt that certain professions and individuals benefited the most from the RWOPS resulting in animosity amongst health care workers at the Johannesburg Hospital. The questionnaires indicated that there was minimal input from all the relevant key actors. This lack of consultation with all relevant actors or perhaps a miscommunication amongst the relevant players may have contributed to the abuse of this policy...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAccurate {{depiction}} of the vocal tract shape is essential for development of speech training aids for <b>hearing</b> impaired. Speech <b>therapists</b> have concluded from their research that if speech disorders are detected {{at an early stage}} then the rectification of those becomes faster and to a great accuracy. In case of adults, the vocal tract shape estimation can be performed by using techniques like X-Ray, MRI or using articulatory analysis by synthesis. Due to certain difficulties present in the methods mentioned like radiation effect and loud sound impulses produced by rapid switching of magnetic field are not considered suitable for children. Thus there is lack of availability of vocal tract shape data for children due to inability to use direct estimation methods for children. So it becomes necessary to carry out comparative study of vocal tract shape estimation techniques of children using indirect vocal tract shape estimation techniques. This paper aims to make available a considerable amount of data to researchers for study towards children's vocal tract shape using implemented techniques. The final objective of research work is to perform a detailed study on techniques available for vocal tract shape estimation, to implement and further compare the covariance and lattice methods for children using MATLAB software. Currently, the vocal tract shape estimation based on autocorrelation method is implemented and the results obtained are presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to assess if there is a {{relationship}} between a Deaf and/or hard of hearing individual???s level of identification with the Deaf culture and their past and current use of therapy. Participants were 25 Deaf and/or hard of hearing individuals, ages 18 to 73 recruited from a local Deaf and hard of hearing service center. Identification was assessed using the Deaf Identity Development Scale. It was hypothesized that individuals that scored highest in the immersed subscale would use less mental health services, perceive more barriers to accessing services, and would be less likely to use a <b>hearing</b> or non-signing <b>therapist</b> than those that scored highest in the marginal, bicultural or hearing subscales. Because there were not enough participants to adequately fill the identity categories, immersed (4 %), bicultural (88 %), hearing (0 %), marginal (4 %), the hypotheses could not be statistically tested. More participants indicated that he or she agreed they want more mental health services than those who did not agree, it failed to reach statistical significance (p =. 064). Although the most endorsed first contact for a mental health issue was family or friends, if they were to use a mental health professional, a majority of participants stated they would prefer someone who can sign or is Deaf...|$|R
40|$|Research was {{received}} enthusiastically. We met {{with other people}} {{working in the field}} and they are now trying to arrange to have a whole day devoted to this type of research at the next conference in two years. If this happens it will be a tremendous opportunity both to get our research out there and to promote AU. Reaching for a Good Life (RFGL) is a program for men who are abusive within an intimate relationship. RFGL has 4 components: a weekly orientation group, individual intake interview, the 16 week group program and the exit interview. Engaging men in the therapeutic process begins with the weekly orientation session. Participants experience a brief explanation of how violence progresses in intimate relationships and are engaged in a discussion of the process. This process allows participants to make an informed choice about their fit with the group content and process. Consent forms are signed and intake assessment tools are completed at this session. Participants meet with an individual therapist who creates a Good Life Plan with participants. In the individual interview the results of the testing are discussed with the participant and the <b>therapists</b> <b>hears</b> the man’s experience that brings him to therapy. Participants then begin one of the weekly group sessions {{at the start of the}} next modules. The group itself is comprised of 4 – four-session modules. These modules are Self-awareness and Arousal Management; Emotional Communication and Conflict Management; Ethical and Moral Decision-making; Consciousness Raising: Power and control. This presentation will describe the RFGL program...|$|R
40|$|Uma parte dos estudos sobre pragmática se debruça sobre o uso das habilidades comunicativas, que se referem à capacidade do indivíduo em participar de uma díade, tendo como objetivo o intercâmbio comunicativo. As habilidades comunicativas permitem o uso da linguagem para diferentes objetivos e funções, de pistas contextuais para determinar o que se diz e a interação entre pessoas para iniciar, manter ou terminar conversações. Na {{literatura}} nacional, ainda não há um protocolo de avaliação de habilidades pragmáticas validado e os materiais disponíveis exigem um tempo de análise extenso. Com este foco, o trabalho aqui apresentado teve como objetivo a elaboração de um checklist para caracterizar o perfil pragmático de crianças, a fim de proporcionar uma redução no tempo de análise para pesquisadores e clínicos. Foram selecionadas 30 crianças de 3 a 8 anos divididas em dois grupos, pareados por idade e gênero, sendo um grupo de 15 crianças com alteração de linguagem (G 1) e um grupo de 15 crianças com desenvolvimento típico de linguagem (G 2). Crianças do G 2 foram avaliadas com um teste de triagem por um fonoaudiólogo. As crianças com alteração de linguagem foram selecionadas a partir da lista de espera na Clínica de Fonoaudiologia da Faculdade de Odontologia de Bauru (FOB-USP), não tendo recebido qualquer intervenção fonoaudiológica. O projeto foi submetido ao Comitê de Ética da FOB-USP e aprovado sob o protocolo no 025148 / 2012. Para o checklist, foi realizada a adaptação do Protocolo de Habilidades Comunicativas Verbais. Para verificar a melhor maneira de realizar a marcação e a permeabilidade da análise proposta, foi realizado um estudo piloto em que três fonoaudiólogas analisaram separadamente as gravações de duas crianças em interação com um adulto. As sugestões foram estudadas e as alterações pertinentes foram realizadas antes da análise de dados. Na coleta de dados, foram realizados registros em DVD de 30 minutos de interação espontânea entre a criança e seu responsável. Para garantir a confiabilidade dos dados, a avaliação foi realizada com dois observadores independentes que deveriam preencher cada checklist, anotando se essas habilidades eram observadas (se sim, adequada ou inadequadamente) ou não observadas na amostra. Todos os registros foram considerados confiáveis e puderam ser analisados estatisticamente. Por meio da análise estatística verificou-se que os resultados foram significativos nas categorias de habilidades dialógicas e narrativo-discursivas, indicando que o checklist foi permeável ao encontrar mudanças nas habilidades pragmáticas das crianças do G 1, em comparação com as crianças do G 2. Mesmo nas habilidades não significantes, foram observadas diferenças entre os perfis. Este trabalho trouxe a contribuição de criar um material de fácil manuseio e aplicabilidade, capaz de verificar quantitativamente o uso das habilidades comunicativas verbais por crianças. O checklist foi sensível em verificar a assimetria entre os diferentes grupos. Sugere-se, como continuidade do estudo, a aplicação do checklist em diferentes populações. Some {{studies on}} pragmatics {{focus on the}} use of communication skills, which refer to the individualś ability to participate in a dyad, aiming communicative exchange. Communication skills enable the use of language for different purposes and functions, from contextual cues to determine what is said, to interaction among people to start, maintain or end conversations. In the literature there is still no national evaluation protocol of pragmatic skills validated and the materials available require long analysis. Focusing on this, the work presented here had aimed the preparation of a checklist to characterize the pragmatic profile of children in order to provide a reduction in analysis time for researchers and clinicians. Were selected two groups of 15 children 3 - 8 years old, matched by age and gender, with a group of children with language disorders (G 1) and a group of children with typical language development (G 2). G 2 children were evaluated with a screening test by a speech hearing pathologist. Children with language disorders were selected from the waiting list of the Clinic of Speech Pathology, Faculty of Dentistry of Bauru (FOB-USP), having received no phonoaudiological intervention. The project was submitted to the Ethics Committee of the FOB-USP and approved under protocol No. 025148 / 2012. For the checklist, was performed the adaptation of the Verbal Communication Skills Protocol. To determine the best way to perform marking and the permeability of proposed analysis, was conducted a pilot study in which three speech <b>hearing</b> <b>therapists</b> analyzed separately the recordings of two children in interaction with an adult. The suggestions were examined and relevant amendments were made before the data analysis. During the data collection the researchers recorded 30 -minute DVD of spontaneous interaction between the child and the guardian. To ensure the data reliability, the evaluation was performed with two independent observers who should fill each checklist by checking whether these skills were observed (if yes, adequately or inadequately) or not observed in the sample. All records were considered reliable and could be analyzed statistically. The collected data were statistically analyzed and {{it was found that the}} results were significant in the categories of dialogic and narrative-discursive skills, showing that the checklist was permeable to find changes of pragmatic skills of children in G 1 compared to G 2 children. Even in skills not statistically significant, differences were observed in the profile. The present study brought the contribution of create a material easy to handle and apply, capable of quantitatively determine the use of verbal communicative skills of children. The checklist was sensitive to verify the asymmetry between the different groups. As a continuation of the study it is suggested the application of the checklist in different populations...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Dyslexia (or {{developmental}} dyslexia {{or specific}} reading disability) {{is a specific}} learning disorder that has a neurobiological origin. It is marked by difficulties with accurate or fluent recognition of words and poor spelling in people who have average or above average intelligence and these difficulties cannot be attributed to another cause, for example, poor vision, hearing difficulty, or lack of socio-environmental opportunities, motivation, or adequate instruction. Studies have correlated reading skills with musical abilities. It has been hypothesized that musical training {{may be able to}} remediate timing difficulties, improve pitch perception, or increase spatial awareness, thereby having a positive effect on skills needed in the development of language and literacy. OBJECTIVES: To study the effectiveness of music education on reading skills (that is, oral reading skills, reading comprehension, reading fluency, phonological awareness, and spelling) in children and adolescents with dyslexia. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the following electronic databases in June 2012 : CENTRAL (2012, Issue 5), MEDLINE (1948 to May Week 4 2012), EMBASE (1980 to 2012 Week 22), CINAHL (searched 7 June 2012), LILACS (searched 7 June 2012), PsycINFO (1887 to May Week 5 2012), ERIC (searched 7 June 2012), Arts and Humanities Citation Index (1970 to 6 June 2012), Conference Proceedings Citation Index - Social Sciences and Humanities (1990 to 6 June 2012), and WorldCat (searched 7 June 2012). We also searched the WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) and reference lists of studies. We did not apply any date or language limits. SELECTION CRITERIA: We planned to include randomized controlled trials. We looked for studies that included at least one of our primary outcomes. The primary outcomes were related to the main domain of the reading: oral reading skills, reading comprehension, reading fluency, phonological awareness, and spelling, measured through validated instruments. The secondary outcomes were self esteem and academic achievement. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors (HCM and RBA) independently screened all titles and abstracts identified through the search strategy to determine their eligibility. For our analysis we had planned to use mean difference for continuous data, with 95 % confidence intervals, and to use the random-effects statistical model when the effect estimates of two or more studies could be combined in a meta-analysis. MAIN RESULTS: We retrieved 851 references via the search strategy. No randomized controlled trials testing music education for the improvement of reading skills in children with dyslexia could be included in this review. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is no evidence available from randomized controlled trials on which to base a judgment about the effectiveness of music education for the improvement of reading skills in children and adolescents with dyslexia. This uncertainty warrants further research via randomized controlled trials, involving a interdisciplinary team: musicians, <b>hearing</b> and speech <b>therapists,</b> psychologists, and physicians...|$|R
