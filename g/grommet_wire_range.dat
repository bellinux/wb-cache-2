5000|$|Carbon steel [...] wire is {{typically}} used for garter springs {{due to its}} affordable price and usability, in comparison to stainless steel. Carbon steel springs tend to have very high yield strengths, {{and are able to}} return to their original shape when temporarily deformed. The carbon content in carbon steel <b>wires</b> <b>range</b> from 0.50 to 0.95 percent. This relatively small amount of carbon is enough to improve the toughness of the spring. The close proximity to oil and high-pressure engines mean heat treated garter springs are essential for enduring temperatures over 100°C (212°F). However, carbon steel is not suitable for highly corrosive environments; stainless steel would be a more viable option. Stainless steel differs from carbon steel in the amount of chromium present; stainless steel has between 10.5% to 11% chromium by mass, while carbon steel has about 1%.|$|R
40|$|Nanowires were {{produced}} by injection of molten Hg and Pb into chrysotile nanotubes. The breakdown of chrysotile {{and the surface}} tension of the molten metals are the limiting factors for the filling procedure. The thermal stability of chrysotile nanotubes was investigated by infrared spectrometry, thermogravimetry, differential thermal analysis, and x-ray diffraction analyses. For short-term thermal annealing (30 min) the tube morphology remains stable up to 700 °C. The high surface tension of both molten Pb and Hg (γLV > 200 mN/m) requires external pressure for the melts to penetrate into the tubes. Filling of the tubes was achieved under high pressure and high temperature conditions compatible with the stability range for chrysotile determined in the annealing experiments. Transmission electron microscopy observations confirmed high filling yields for both metals. Almost all nanotubes were partially filled with lead.

By using double buffering technology, we obtain smooth animation during the off-line machining simulation. The computational cost of a collision detection algorithm is decided {{not only by the}} complexity of the basic interference test used, but also by the number of times every test is applied. To simplify the collision detection algorithm, an approximate method of representing wire model and machine model by using line segments and planes is applied.

40|$|Domain wall {{manipulation}} in ferromagnets shows {{great promise}} {{for the development}} of fast and efficient computer memory devices. In particular, chromium dioxide has a half-metal characteristic that holds the potential for reducing the heat produced from reading or writing memory bits. To reliably control the motion of domain walls, CrO 2 nanowires are created with geometric anisotropy that acts as a potential well to ”pin” domain walls to fixed sites. Each wire was grown using selective-area growth to avoid the creation of random pinning sites from crystal disorder. This process is sensitive to many different factors {{in the creation of the}} SiO 2 mask. Different effects can interfere with each other, including the proximity effect from electron beam lithography and a sensitivity to the levels of oxygen in the doped SiO 2. This thesis presents methods of correction for individual effects, as well as initial results of domain wall mechanics in CrO 2 nanowires. Using MFM measurements, I show the static pinning of a domain wall at the predicted pinning location. Magnetoresistance measurements of CrO 2 <b>wires</b> <b>ranging</b> from 700 nm to 900 nm wide show that, at this scale, the dominant influence on the domain wall mechanics remains the magnetocrystalline anisotropy, instead of shape anisotropy as desired...|$|R

Stainless steel diffused out into the alumina leaving few pores behind. Titanium, on the other hand, diffused into alumina at 20 to 30 micrometers/hour and left plenty of Kirkendal porosity behind.

40|$|Atomic {{clusters}} can {{be produced}} in a size range (100 nm to 0. 5 nm) that bridges {{the gap between the}} limits of current lithographic fabrication technologies for integrated circuits and the atomic/molecular regime. The work presented here aims to combine established &# 039;top-down&# 039; device processing with &# 039;bottom-up&# 039; engineered cluster assembly. Conducting cluster deposition and standard optical fabrication techniques have been used to produce wires on a textured (V-grooved) substrate. The lengths of the <b>wires</b> (<b>ranging</b> from 2 µm to 1 mm) are defined simply by the separation of NiCr/Au contacts. The deposited nanoparticles range in size from 20 - 100 nm and in principle define the width of the nanowire. In-situ conductance measurement allows precise control of the deposition process and the onset of conduction in the wire is readily monitored as a function of deposition time. The effectiveness of the surface templating technique is demonstrated by SEM and AFM imaging carried out after deposition. The surface coverage is seen to vary from 100 % at the apexes of the V-grooves used to promote growth of the wire. Self assembly of the nanoparticles leads to completion of a wire between the pre-formed contacts with no possibility of a parasitic conduction path. Wires formed through this technique currently have minimum widths of ~ 1 µm but straightforward extensions of the technique should soon allow nanowire formation...|$|R
40|$|External {{magnetic}} fields {{have been used}} to vertically align ensembles of silicon microwires coated with ferromagnetic nickel films. X-ray diffraction and image analysis techniques were used to quantify the degree of vertical orientation of the microwires. The degree of vertical alignment and the minimum field strength required for alignment were evaluated {{as a function of the}} wire length, coating thickness, magnetic history, and substrate surface properties. Nearly 100 % of 100 μm long, 2 μm diameter, Si microwires that had been coated with 300 nm of Ni could be vertically aligned by a 300 G magnetic field. For <b>wires</b> <b>ranging</b> from 40 to 60 μm in length, as the length of the wire increased, a higher degree of alignment was observed at lower field strengths, consistent with an increase in the available magnetic torque. Microwires that had been exposed to a magnetic sweep up to 300 G remained magnetized and, therefore, aligned more readily during subsequent magnetic field alignment sweeps. Alignment of the Ni-coated Si microwires occurred at lower field strengths on hydrophilic Si substrates than on hydrophobic Si substrates. The magnetic field alignment approach provides a pathway for the directed assembly of solution-grown semiconductor wires into vertical arrays, with potential applications in solar cells as well as in other electronic devices that utilize nano- and microscale components as active elements...|$|R
40|$|A steam tunnel, {{suitable}} for making experimental {{measurements of the}} heat transfer from fine wires to a viscous compressible fluid, was developed and constructed. Measurements of Nusselt numbers and recovery temperatures were carried out using small-diameter (0. 00038 to 0. 00254 cm.) tungsten wires in steam flow with Reynolds numbers ranging from about 1 to 12 and with nominal Mach numbers of 0. 5 to 1. 7. Considerable difference {{was found between the}} Nusselt numbers for wires in subsonic and supersonic flow at corresponding Reynolds numbers.
