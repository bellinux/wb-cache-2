5|$|Several urban legends exist {{regarding}} the chariot sequence. One claims that a stuntman died during filming, which Nosher Powell claims in his autobiography, and another states that a red Ferrari {{can be seen}} during the chariot race. The book Movie Mistakes claims this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>myth.</b> Heston, in a DVD commentary track for the film, mentions that a third urban legend claims that he wore a wristwatch during the chariot race, but points out that he wore leather bracers up to the elbow.|$|E
5|$|The film {{compares the}} rise of the {{neoconservative}} movement in the United States and the radical Islamist movement, drawing comparisons between their origins, and remarking on similarities between the two groups. More controversially, it argues that radical Islamism as a massive, sinister organisation, specifically in the form of al-Qaeda, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>myth,</b> or noble lie, perpetuated by leaders of many countries—and particularly neoconservatives in the U.S.—in a renewed attempt to unite and inspire their people after the ultimate failure of utopian ideas.|$|E

5|$|The carrot is a {{biennial}} {{plant in}} the umbellifer family Apiaceae. At first, it grows a rosette of leaves while building up the enlarged taproot. Fast-growing cultivars mature within three months (90 days) of sowing the seed, while slower-maturing cultivars are harvested four months later (120 days). The roots contain high quantities of alpha- and beta-carotene, and are {{a good source of}} vitamin K and vitamin B6, but the belief that eating carrots improves night vision <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>myth</b> put forward by the British in World War II to mislead the enemy about their military capabilities.|$|E
5|$|The legend that de' Medici {{introduced}} {{a long list}} of foods, techniques and utensils from Italy to France for the first time <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>myth</b> routinely discredited by most food historians. Items whose introduction to France have been attributed to Catherine include the dinner fork, parsley, the artichoke, lettuce, broccoli, the garden pea, pasta, Parmesan, as well as the turkey and tomato of the New World. She has also received credit for introducing sauces and a variety of dishes such as duck à l’orange and deviled eggs.|$|E
5|$|Newspaper {{headlines}} in most World Cup nations trumpeted the shocking upset, except ironically in the United States and England. There {{was only one}} American journalist at the World Cup: Dent McSkimming of the St. Louis Post-Dispatch; he could not persuade the newspaper {{to pay for the}} trip, and had taken time off work to cover the event. His report of the match was the only one to appear in any major American newspaper. In England, newspapers at the time were generally small, and only had a single page devoted to sports. Because the English cricket team happened to suffer their first-ever defeat by the West Indies the very same day, that was the major story in most publications. Legend has it that in publications that did report the World Cup match, so unexpected was the result that it was presumed that the 1–0 scoreline was a typing error and so it was reported that England had won on a scoreline of 10–0 or 10–1. However, historical newspapers online at The British Newspaper Archive show that the story <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>myth.</b>|$|E

5|$|Ovine {{obstetrics}} can be problematic. By selectively breeding ewes {{that produce}} multiple offspring with higher birth weights for generations, sheep producers have inadvertently caused some domestic sheep to have difficulty lambing. However, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>myth</b> that sheep cannot lamb without human assistance; many ewes give birth directly in pasture without aid. This can be proven {{by the fact}} that they give birth in the wild. Balancing ease of lambing with high productivity is one of the dilemmas of sheep breeding. While the majority of births are relatively normal and do not require intervention, many complications may arise. A lamb may present in the normal fashion (with both legs and head forward), but may simply be too large to slide out of the birth canal. This often happens when large rams are crossed with diminutive ewes (this is related to breed, rams are naturally larger than ewes by comparison). Lambs may also present themselves with one shoulder to the side, completely backward, or with only some of their limbs protruding. Lambs may also be spontaneously aborted or stillborn. Reproductive failure is a common consequence of infections such as toxoplasmosis and foot-and-mouth disease. Some types of abortion in sheep are preventable by vaccinations against these infections.|$|E

25|$|While a {{large portion}} of urban Russians grow some {{vegetables}} in their dacha gardens, the perception in some parts of society that urban Russians are becoming increasingly self-sufficient <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>myth,</b> and only some 15 percent of vegetables are grown by urban dwellers.|$|E
