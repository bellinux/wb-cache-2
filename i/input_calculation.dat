Since the <b>input,</b> <b>calculations</b> and output were all mixed on a sheet, changing the layout could lead to serious problems if data moved. With the data and formulas separated, this was no longer an issue. Salas demonstrated that this separation meant that a number of common tasks that required lengthy calculations on existing spreadsheets could be handled almost for free simply by changing the view. For instance, if a spreadsheet contained a list of monthly sales, it was not uncommon to have an output column that summed up the sales by month. But if one wanted that summed by year, this would normally require another formula column and a different output sheet.|$|R

In the event simulation software called event generators, the structure of multi-jet events is determined through an interplay of the <b>input</b> <b>calculation,</b> parton showers and phenomenological hadronisation models.

40|$|Apremilast is {{compared}} to best supportive care (BSC), and response to treatment is assessed after a trial period of 16 weeks, which corresponds to the primary efficacy endpoint in the apremilast clinical trials. DES is a technique that is event-based and models a population {{at the individual level}} in terms of utility, costs, and resource use. The DES was implemented as a series of <b>input,</b> <b>calculation,</b> and output flowcharts in Arena®. The DES reported an incremental QALY per patient of 0. 16 and incremental cost per patient of $ 17, 325. The Markov model reported an incremental QALY of 0. 18 and incremental cost per patient of $ 34, 733. The differences can be explained when taking into account the differences in how age and life expectancy are handled in the models. The Markov model uses a single age: 50, whereas the DES uses an age distribution. The Markov model uses an actuarial table to calculate background mortality whereas the DES uses a distribution for life expectancy. These differences between Markov and DES in not just inputs, but how patient characteristics are handled, lead to different results. Markov models are structured in terms of states and transitions, and the main limitations are: using states to represent the problem; the need for homogenous populations; and the inability to take competing risks into account. Transitioning between states can account for the disease progression, but this method is unable to handle competing risks. Discrete event simulations do not have those limitations and also allow for structural flexibility and are easier to adapt if further data become available.

40|$|Key findings: The FISHRENT {{model is}} {{a major step forward}} in bio-economic model-ling, {{combining}} features that have not been fully integrated in earlier models: 1 - Incorporation of any number of species (or stock) and/or fleets 2 - Integration of simulation and optimisation over a period of 25 years 3 - Integration of effort and TAC-driven management policies 4 - Three independent relations for stock growth, production and investments. The feedbacks within the model allow for a dynamic simulation. The main application of the model is scenario analysis of policy options. Complementary findings: The model formulates a complete set of mathematical relations, but it also con-tains a number of important assumptions, which remain to be tested empirically. Therefore the model presents a challenging agenda for empirical research, which should lead to further qualitative and quantitative improvements of the in-dividual mathematical equations and parameter values. Method: This model was developed during the EU-funded project 'Remuneration of spawning stock biomass'. Its aim was to generate consistent sets of scenarios for an assessment of potential resource rents in different EU fisheries. The model comprises six modules, each focussing on a different aspect of the functioning of the fisheries system: biology (stocks), economy (costs, earnings and profits), policy (TACs, effort and access fees), behaviour (investments), prices (fish and fuel) and an interface linking the modules together. <b>Input,</b> <b>calculation</b> and output are clearly separated. The model produces a standard set of graphics, which provide a quick insight into the results of any model run. All output of the model runs can be exported to database software for further analysis. The model has been built in Excel, which makes it accessible for most us-ers. It has been used in new applications and even translated to other software.

40|$|One of {{the initial}} and {{persistent}} concerns {{over the use of}} mobile refuge alternatives (RA) is the temperature rise inside the RA from the metabolic heat of the occupants and the heat released by the CO 2 scrubbing system. Moreover, the humidity within the RA will increase as the occupants lose water through respiration and perspiration. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) Office of Mine Safety and Health Research (OMSHR) in its 2007 report to Congress on refuge alternatives recommended that refuge alternatives be designed and deployed to ensure that a temperature-humidity metric known as apparent temperature not exceed 9520 F [NIOSH 2007]. Subsequently the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) adopted this recommendation. Notwithstanding the above process, a standard method to determine compliance with this metric does not exist. The heat transfer process in an RA, including the contributions of the human occupants, is highly complex, and is not easily defined analytically or experimentally. Initially, regulatory agencies accepted the certification of registered professional engineers that the manufactured RAs met the apparent temperature requirement. In 2007, NIOSH tested four mobile RAs in its Lake Lynn Experimental Mine, and found that two failed to meet the apparent temperature criterion by a wide margin. These tests used artificial heat and humidity sources to simulate the heat and humidity loading of human occupants.

40|$|Knowledge {{about the}} spatial {{variability}} of denitrification {{rates and the}} lifetime of denitrification in nitrate-contaminated aquifers is crucial to predict the development of groundwater quality. Therefore, regression models were derived to estimate the measured cumulative denitrification of aquifer sediments after one year of incubation from initial denitrification rates and several sediment parameters, namely total sulphur, total organic carbon, extractable sulphate, extractable dissolved organic carbon, hot water soluble organic carbon and potassium permanganate labile organic carbon. For this purpose, we incubated aquifer material from two sandy Pleistocene aquifers in Northern Germany under anaerobic conditions in the laboratory using the 15 N tracer technique. The measured amount of denitrification ranged from 0. 19 to 56. 2 mg N kg− 1 yr− 1 . The laboratory incubations exhibited high differences between non-sulphidic and sulphidic aquifer material in both aquifers with respect to all investigated sediment parameters. Denitrification rates and the estimated lifetime of denitrification {{were higher in the}} sulphidic samples. For these samples, the cumulative denitrification measured during one year of incubation (Dcum(365)) exhibited distinct linear regressions with the stock of reduced compounds in the investigated aquifer samples. Dcum(365) was predictable from sediment variables within a range of uncertainty of 0. 5 to 2 (calculated Dcum(365) /measured Dcum(365)) for aquifer material with a Dcum(365) > 20 mg N kg− 1 yr− 1 . Predictions were poor for samples with lower Dcum(365), such as samples from the NO 3 &minus; bearing groundwater zone, which includes the non-sulphidic samples, from the upper part of both aquifers where denitrification is not sufficient to protect groundwater from anthropogenic NO 3 &minus; <b>input.</b> <b>Calculation</b> of Dcum(365) from initial denitrification rates was only successful for samples from the NO 3 &minus;-bearing zone, whereas a lag-phase of denitrification in samples from deeper zones of NO 3 &minus; free groundwater caused imprecise predictions.

Moreover, the protective lifetime of denitrification sufficient to remove NO 3 &minus; from groundwater in the investigated aquifers is limited, which demonstrates the need to minimise anthropogenic NO 3 &minus; input...|$|E

40|$|Pandrol Rail Fastenings Limited are a {{designer}} and manufacturer of railway rail-fastening systems. As an organisation {{they have the}} capability to reduce the noise impact of bridges using resilient track components. They also have a commercial interest in providing such technology. Knowledge of the processes behind bridge noise is important to Pandrol in two ways; to aid the engineers within the organisation in the design of fastening systems and to demonstrate a state-of-the-art understanding of the problem of railway bridge noise to customers, as this will aid in the sale of Pandrol products. The fitting of new rail components to an existing track form, or failure to meet noise regulations with a new track form, can be costly. It is important to be able to predict accurately the effectiveness of noise reduction techniques. Currently, Pandrol’s knowledge of the problem consists almost entirely of experience gained and data gathered while working on existing bridge projects. To expand their knowledge base, Pandrol perform noise and vibration measurements on railway bridges and viaducts and then use the measured data to predict the performance of their systems on other bridges. This completely empirical approach to predicting bridge noise is both costly and situation specific results cannot be provided before the installation of the fastening system. ii Another approach to predicting bridge noise is through the application of analytical models. Limited analytical modelling in the context of bridge noise is currently conducted within the organisation. For these reasons, Pandrol are sponsoring research into bridge noise in the form of this EngD project. Here an existing rapid calculation approach is identified that relies less on the exact geometry of the bridge and more on its general characteristics. In this approach an analytical model of the track is coupled to a statistical energy analysis (SEA) model of the bridge. This approach forms a suitable basis from which to develop a better model here by concentrating on its weaknesses. A mid-frequency calculation for the power input to the bridge via a resilient track system has been developed by modelling the track-bridge system as two finite Timoshenko beams continuously connected by a resilient layer. This has resulted in a power <b>input</b> <b>calculation</b> which includes the important effects of coupling between the rail and bridge and the resonance effects of the finite length of a bridge. In addition, a detailed study of the frequency characteristics of deep I-section beams has been performed using Finite Element, Boundary Element and Dynamic stiffness models. It is shown that, at high frequencies, the behaviour of the beam is characterised by in-plane motion of the beam web and bending motion in the flange. This knowledge has resulted in an improved calculation for the mobility of a bridge at high frequencies. The above improvements are included in an improved model for use by Pandrol in their general activities. Data from real bridges is compared to predictions from the improved model in order to validate different aspects of the model. The model is then used to study the effect on noise of varying many bridge design parameters. It is shown that the parameter that has most influence on the noise performance of a bridge is the dynamic stiffness of the resilient rail fastening system. Additionally it is demonstrated that for a given bridge and noise receiver location, an optimum fastener stiffness exists where the noise radiated by the bridge and track is at a minimum.
