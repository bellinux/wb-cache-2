50|$|Regular rayon has {{lengthwise}} lines called striations and its cross-section is an indented circular shape. The cross-sections of HWM and cupra rayon are rounder. Filament rayon yarns {{vary from}} 80 to 980 filaments per yarn and vary {{in size from}} 40 to 5000 denier. Staple fibers range from 1.5 to 15 denier and are mechanically or chemically crimped. Rayon fibers are naturally very bright, but the addition of <b>delustering</b> pigments cuts down on this natural brightness.|$|E
40|$|Stabilising {{the melt}} {{viscosity}} of aliphatic or aromatic-aliphatic homo- or co-polyesters contg. Sn, Ti and/or Zr cpds. as catalysts/initiators involves adding a masking agent contg. a cpd. {{with at least}} one tropolone ring (I) to the melt obtd. in the synthesis or reprocessing of the polyester. Pref. masking agent (I) is alpha-tropolone, thujaplicin, purpurogallin or a mixt. thereof. The polyester is obtd. by ring-opening polymerisation or melt polycondensation in presence of initiators/catalysts. (I) is added in an excess of upto 2 wt% w. r. t. initiator/catalyst, opt. together with filler and/or reinforcing material and/or nucleating agent and/or <b>delustering</b> agent. (I) is intimately mixed with the polyester; in the case of reprocessing, (I) may be added to the melt obtd., or added before or during reprocessing. USE - Cpds. (I) are used as masking agents in polyester melts as above (claimed). ADVANTAGE - Stabilises (co) polyesters against thermal and/or thermo-oxidative degradation during melt processing to fibres, film or moulded prods. or during recycling by melt-sepn. processes...|$|E
40|$|Acid rain, {{precipitation}} with a ph {{less than}} 5. 6, {{is known to}} damage lakes, vegetation and buildings. Degradation of outdoor textiles by acid rain is strongly suspected but not well documented. This study reports the effects of sunlight, aqueous acid, heat and humidity (acid rain conditions) on spun <b>delustered</b> nylon 6, 6 fabric. Untreated nylon and nylon treated with sulfuric acid of ph 2. 0, 3. 0 and 4. 4 were exposed to light in an Atlas Xenon-arc fadeometer at 63 (DEGREES) C and 65...|$|R
