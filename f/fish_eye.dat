50|$|Tylodelphys is a {{parasitic}} fluke that infects {{the small}} water fish. It induces many behavioral changeson its host. Once inside a <b>fish’s</b> <b>eye,</b> {{it can cause}} partial blindness and several behavioral changes to the intermediate host. Other species of flukes are able to turn into dormant cysts at certain stages of development, but Tylodelphys stays active and roams free inside the <b>fish’s</b> <b>eye,</b> giving it an opportunity for it to induce parasite behavior. When Tylodelphys larvae crawl around {{the inside of the}} <b>fish’s</b> <b>eye,</b> it can get in between the retina and the lens. This can cause partial blindness to the fish, rendering the fish unable to notice predators.|$|R

The Digistar has a resolution of 8000 by 8000 pixels. Its graphics processing computer takes numerical data and manipulates it to compensate for the domed projection surface. It can also rapidly transform shapes and perspectives to create the illusion of motion, for example, travelling through the solar system at a high velocity.|$|E

The film is essentially a remake of Body Heat, which was, in turn, loosely based on Billy Wilder's 1944 film Double Indemnity, which was a version of James Cain's novel Double Indemnity.|$|E
5000|$|A convex mirror, {{diverging}} mirror, or <b>fish</b> <b>eye</b> {{mirror is}} a curved mirror {{in which the}} reflective surface bulges toward the light source. Convex mirrors reflect light outwards, therefore they {{are not used to}} focus light. Such mirrors always form a virtual image, since the focal point (F) and the centre of curvature (2F) are both imaginary points [...] "inside" [...] the mirror, that cannot be reached. As a result, images formed by these mirrors cannot be projected on a screen, since the image is inside the mirror. The image is smaller than the object, but gets larger as the object approaches the mirror.|$|E

5|$|Vision is an {{important}} sensory system for most species of <b>fish.</b> <b>Fish</b> <b>eyes</b> {{are similar to those}} of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both rods and cones (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have colour vision. Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light. Amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the hagfish has only primitive eyespots. Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea <b>fishes</b> have <b>eyes</b> suited to the dark environment.|$|R

50|$|The biggest {{advantage}} of catadioptric systems (panoramic mirror lenses) {{is that because}} one uses mirrors to bend the light rays instead of lenses (like <b>fish</b> <b>eye),</b> the image has almost no chromatic aberrations or distortions. The image, {{a reflection of the}} surface on the mirror, {{is in the form of}} a doughnut to which software is applied in order to create a flat panoramic picture. Such software is normally supplied by the company who produces the system. Because the complete panorama is imaged at once, dynamic scenes can be captured without problems. Panoramic video can be captured and has found applications in robotics and journalism. The mirror lens system uses only a partial section of the digital camera's sensor and therefore some pixels are not used. Recommendations are always to use a camera with a high pixel count in order to maximize the resolution of the final image.|$|E

There are two versions of the video, both made in 1992. One version has strips of paper flying through the air, and is mostly found on music video sites like Yahoo! Music. The other version has lyrics onscreen, complete with a [...] "follow-the-bouncing-ball", but with no paper flying around.

50|$|PVDF is {{used for}} {{specialty}} monofilament fishing lines, sold as fluorocarbon replacements for nylon monofilament. The surface is harder, so it is more resistant to abrasion and sharp fish teeth.
