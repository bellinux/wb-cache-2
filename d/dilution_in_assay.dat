40|$|A {{specific}} and sensitive radioimmunoassay for {{the determination of}} levels of zalcitabine in human plasma, urine, and cerebrospinal fluid has been developed. Commercially available radiolabel and antiserum (Sigma Chemicals) were used after <b>dilution</b> <b>in</b> <b>assay</b> buffer. Prior to the immunoassay, standard and patient samples were subjected to solid-phase extraction on silica columns {{in order to obtain}} purified samples. The lower limit of quantitation was determined to be 1 ng/ml. Intra- and interassay variations were less than 11 % for a number of quality control samples of drug in plasma and urine. Results from parallelism studies with plasma and urine demonstrated that samples outside the standard range (1 to 30 ng/ml) could be diluted by blank plasma or assay buffer, respectively. A large number of related compounds and potentially coadministered drugs were tested for cross-reactivity. Stability tests showed that heat treatment for 30 min at 60 °C or storage for 1 month at- 30 °C did not affect zalcitabine concentrations in plasma or urine. The radioimmunoassay with solid-phase extraction for sample cleanup discussed here has been successfully applied in a pharmacokinetic study of a single patient, demonstrating its applicability for clinical pharmacokinetic research with zalcitabine.

30|$|We {{determined}} TAC in serum samples using antioxidant assay kit (Cayman Chemical Corporation, Ann Arbor, USA). The assay {{is based}} on the ability to inhibit the oxidation of ABTS® (2, 2 ′-azino-di-[3 -ethylbenzthiazoline sulfonate]) to ABTS®+ by metmyoglobin by antioxidants of the serum sample. The antioxidant capacity from the serum sample to prevent ABTS oxidation is compared with that by Trolox (a water-soluble tocopherol analog) and was quantified as molar Trolox equivalents. We assayed all samples, following manufacturer’s instructions, in duplicate at 20 -fold <b>dilutions</b> <b>in</b> <b>assay</b> buffer.

40|$|Homogeneous cytosolic {{pyruvate}} kinase from endosperm of germinating castor oil (Ricinus communis L. cv Hale) seeds was potently activated by polyethylene glycol. The addition of 5 % (w/v) polyethylene glycol to the {{pyruvate kinase}} reaction mixture caused a 2. 6 -fold increase in maximal velocity and 12. 5 - and 2 -fold reductions in Km values for phosphoenolpyruvate and ADP, respectively. Glycerol, ethylene glycol, and bovine serum albumin also enhanced pyruvate kinase activity, albeit {{to a lesser}} extent than polyethylene glycol. The addition of 5 % (w/v) polyethylene glycol to the elution buffer during high-performance gel filtration chromatography of purified cytosolic pyruvate kinase helped to stabilize the active heterotetrameric native structure of the enzyme. A higher degree of inhibition by MgATP, but lower sensitivity to the inhibitors 3 -phosphoglycerate and fructose- 1, 6 -bisphosphate, was also observed in the presence of 5 % (w/v) polyethylene glycol. It is concluded that (a) plant cytosolic pyruvate kinase activity and regulation, like that of other regulatory pyruvate kinases, is modified by extreme <b>dilution</b> <b>in</b> the <b>assay</b> medium, probably as a result of deaggregation of the native tetrameric enzyme, and (b) ATP is probably the major metabolic effector of germinating castor endosperm cytosolic pyruvate kinase in vivo...|$|R

Patients and methods: M 30 and M 65 were measured in matched serum and plasma samples from 31 lung cancer patients and 18 controls. Results: Time allowable between sample acquisition and processing {{is critical for}} <b>assays</b> <b>in</b> clinical use. A 4 -h delay in processing at room temperature increased M 30 (P < 0. 0001), an effect minimised by incubation on ice. M 30 and M 65 in serum were resistant to processing variations including delays. Serum and plasma measurements correlated well although M 30 but not M 65 was lower in serum (P < 0. 0005). Less variation between duplicate <b>assays</b> was observed <b>in</b> serum.

40|$|Lactic acid {{bacteria}} (LAB) play {{an important}} role as natural preservatives in fermented food and beverage systems, reducing the application of chemical additives. Thus, investigating their antifungal compounds, such as cyclic dipeptides, has gained prominence. Previous research has primarily focussed on isolation of these compounds. However, their precise quantification will provide further information regarding their antifungal performance in a complex system. To address this, deuterated labelled standards of the cyclic dipeptides cyclo(Leu-Pro), cyclo(Pro-Pro), cyclo(Met-Pro) and cyclo(Phe-Pro) were synthesized, and stable isotope dilution assays were developed, enabling an accurate quantification of cyclo(Leu-Pro), cyclo(Pro-Pro), cyclo(Met-Pro) and cyclo(Phe-Pro) in MRS-broth and wort. Quantitative results showed that, in the Lactobacillus brevis R 2 Δ fermented MRS-broth, the concentrations of cyclo(Leu-Pro), cyclo(Pro-Pro) and cyclo(Phe-Pro) were significantly higher (P[*]<[*] 0. 05), than in wort for cyclo (Leu-Pro) when compared with their controls. This indicates that the formation of these three cyclic dipeptides is related to L. brevis R 2 Δ metabolism.

40|$|The cytosolic {{glutathione}} S-transferase (GST) enzymes {{serve as}} ideal biomarkers of organ damage as they exhibit {{many of the}} required characteristics, i. e. specific localisation, high cytosolic concentration and relatively short half-life. The role of GSTs as early indicators of organ damage is applicable to both human and animal models. Because of the regio-specific localisation of the different isoforms of GST in liver and kidney, simultaneous monitoring of classes of GSTs in biological matrices permits the identification of specific areas of damage within a particular organ. Immunoassays have been developed which quantify canine alpha GST and roden microGST (Yb 1). The immunoassays are solid phase EIAs, where GST in the sample or standard is captured by a specific anti-GST antibody coated onto the solid phase. After washing, a specific enzyme-labelled IgG conjugate is added which binds to the captured GST. After a further washing step, substrate is added and a colour developed. The absorbance is measured on an ELISA plate reader and is directly proportional {{to the amount of}} GST present in the sample. The assays are performed at room temperature and can be completed within 3 h. The immunoassays are specific for each GST and have a range of 0 - 100 micrograms/l. A range of assay parameters were investigated to validate the EIAs for GST detection. The assays are sensitive and reproducible. CV for inter- and intra-assay variation were below 9 % for Yb 1 assay and below 20 % for the canine alpha GST EIA. Recovery of spiked GST over the standard curve range was 102 and 99 %, respectively.

One strategy that may help overcome tumour heterogeneity is the identification of tumour sub-populations that drive specific disease pathologies {{for the development of}} therapies targeting these clinically relevant sub-populations. Here, we have identified a dye-retaining brain tumour population that displays all the hallmarks of a tumour-initiating sub-population. Using a limiting <b>dilution</b> transplantation <b>assay</b> <b>in</b> immunocompromised mice, label-retaining brain tumour cells display elevated tumour-initiation properties relative to the bulk population. Importantly, tumours generated from these label-retaining cells exhibit all the pathological features of the primary disease. Together, these findings confirm dye-retaining brain tumour cells exhibit tumour-initiation ability and are therefore viable targets for the development of therapeutics targeting this sub-population...|$|R
40|$|Human B {{lymphoblastoid}} {{cell lines}} facilitate {{the growth in}} vitro of human NK cells and of T cell clones (1 - 4), and together with a source of IL- 2, have been successfully used to maintain both NK and T cell clones in culture (1, 2). We have shown that irradiated B lymphoblastoid cell lines induce proliferation of purified human NK cells only in synergy with IL- 2 (3). They also facilitate continued proliferation and enhance the cloning efficiency of purified human NK cells <b>in</b> limiting <b>dilution</b> <b>assays</b> <b>in</b> the presence of IL- 2 without increasing the proportion (> 507 o) ofNK cells entering the cell cycle in response to IL- 2 (4). During culture of total PBMC with irradiated B cell lines, NK cells become activated, as shown by increased cytotoxic activity, by proliferation, and by expression of surface activation antigens such as class II HLA antigens, transferrin receptors, and IL- 2 receptors (5, 6). In these cultures, a preferential proliferation of CD 16 + CD 56 (NKH- 1) + CD 3 - NK cells is observed (6) : in 10 -d cultures, NK cell number is increased 25 -fold, whereas T cell number is increased only 3 -fold. Elimination of CD 4 + cells or {{the presence of an}} anti-IL- 2 antiserum completely prevents NK cell proliferation (6), suggesting tha...|$|R
40|$|Clinical and {{preclinical}} {{applications of}} human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) are often limited by scarcity of cells. Expanding human HSCs {{to increase their}} numbers while maintaining their stem cell properties has therefore become an important area of research. Here, we report a robust HSC coculture system wherein cord blood CD 34 + CD 133 + cells were cocultured with mesenchymal stem cells engineered to express angiopoietin-like- 5 in a defined medium. After 11 days of culture, SCID repopulating cells were expanded 60 -fold by limiting <b>dilution</b> <b>assay</b> <b>in</b> NOD-scid Il 2 rg−/− (NSG) mice. The cultured CD 34 + CD 133 + cells had similar engraftment potential to uncultured CD 34 + CD 133 + cells <b>in</b> competitive repopulation <b>assays</b> and were capable of efficient secondary reconstitution. Further, the expanded cells supported a robust multilineage reconstitution of human blood cells in NSG recipient mice, including a more efficient T-cell reconstitution. These results demonstrate that the expanded CD 34 + CD 133 + cells maintain both short-term and long-term HSC activities. To our knowledge, this 60 -fold expansion of SCID repopulating cells is the best expansion of human HSCs reported to date. Further development of this coculture method for expanding human HSCs for clinical and preclinical applications is therefore warranted. National Institutes of Health (U. S.)

40|$|The {{importance}} of real-time {{polymerase chain reaction}} (PCR) has increased steadily in clinical applications over the last decade. Many applications utilize SYBR Green I dye to follow the accumulation of amplicons in real time. SYBR Green I has, however, a number of limitations that include the inhibition of PCR, preferential binding to GC-rich sequences and effects on melting curve analysis. Although a few alternative dyes without some of these limitations have been recently proposed, no large-scale investigation into the properties of intercalating dyes has been performed. In this study, we investigate 15 different intercalating DNA dyes for their inhibitory effects on PCR, effects on DNA melting temperature and possible preferential binding to GC-rich sequences. Our results demonstrated that {{in contrast to the}} results of SYBR Green I, two intercalating dyes SYTO- 13 and SYTO- 82 do not inhibit PCR, show no preferential binding to GC rich sequences and do not influence melting temperature, Tm, even at high concentrations. In addition, SYTO- 82 demonstrated a 50 -fold lower detection limit <b>in</b> a <b>dilution</b> series <b>assay.</b> <b>In</b> conclusion, the properties of SYTO- 82 and SYTO- 13 will simplify the development of multiplex assays and increase the sensitivity of real-time PCR...|$|R
