40|$|Direct readout is the {{capability}} to acquire information directly from meteorological satellites. Data can be acquired from NASA-developed, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) -operated satellites, {{as well as from}} other nations' meteorological satellites. By setting up a personal computer-based <b>ground</b> (<b>Earth)</b> <b>station</b> to receive satellite signals, direct readout may be obtained. The electronic satellite signals are displayed as images on the computer screen. The images can display gradients of the Earth's topography and temperature, cloud formations, the flow and direction of winds and water currents, the formation of hurricanes, the occurrence of an eclipse, and a view of Earth's geography. Both visible and infrared images can be obtained. This booklet introduces the satellite systems, ground station configuration, and computer requirements involved in direct readout.

50|$|A <b>ground</b> <b>station,</b> <b>earth</b> <b>station,</b> or <b>earth</b> {{terminal}} is a {{terrestrial radio}} station designed for extraplanetary telecommunication with spacecraft (constituting {{part of the}} ground segment of the spacecraft system), or reception of radio waves from astronomical radio sources. Ground stations may be located either {{on the surface of}} the Earth, or in its atmosphere. <b>Earth</b> <b>stations</b> communicate with spacecraft by transmitting and receiving radio waves in the super high frequency or extremely high frequency bands (e.g., microwaves). When a ground station successfully transmits radio waves to a spacecraft (or vice versa), it establishes a telecommunications link. A principal telecommunications device of the ground station is the parabolic antenna.|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{investigates the}} effectiveness of optical communication links in enabling high-speed data transfer from deep-space (DS) probes directly to <b>Earth</b> <b>ground</b> <b>stations.</b> In particular, the propagation impairments induced by clouds are estimated by exploiting long-term radiosonde observation data collected in some European sites. The impact of different cloud types on optical links operating at 1. 55 μm is first quantified in terms of total path attenuation, and afterward, the implementation of multisite diversity schemes is discussed to counteract the extremely high attenuation levels caused by clouds. Results show that a three-site diversity system with target availability of 90 % allows reduction of the link margin to counteract cloud attenuation from at least 40 dB to ∼ 6 [*][*]dB, which makes optical communications a viable option also for DS mission...|$|R

40|$|Modern {{communications}} satellites {{rely heavily}} upon deployable appendage (i. e., solar arrays, communications antennas, etc.) to perform vital functions that enable the spacecraft to effectively conduct mission objectives. Communications and telemetry antennas provide the radio-frequency {{link between the}} spacecraft and the <b>earth</b> <b>ground</b> <b>station,</b> permitting {{data to be transmitted}} and received from the satellite. Solar arrays serve as the principle source of electrical energy to the satellite, and re-charge internal batteries during operation. However, since satellites cannot carry back-up systems, if a solar array fails to deploy, the mission is lost. The subject of on-orbit anomalies related to the deployment of spacecraft appendage, and possible causes of such failures are examined. Topics discussed include mechanical launch loading, on-orbit thermal and solar concerns, reliability of spacecraft pyrotechnics, and practical limitations of ground-based deployment testing. Of particular significance, the article features an in-depth look at the lessons learned from the successful recovery of the Telesat Canada Anik-E 2 satellite in 1991...|$|R
5000|$|A laser {{communication}} system {{was one of}} four science instruments launched with the NASA Lunar Atmosphere and Dust Environment Explorer (LADEE) mission on 7 Sept 2013. After a month-long transit to the Moon, and a 40-day spacecraft checkout, the laser comm experiments were performed over three months during late 2013 to early 2014. Initial data returned from the Lunar Laser Communication Demonstration (LLCD) equipment on LADEE set a space communication bandwidth record in October 2013 when early tests using a pulsed laser beam to transmit data over the 239000 mi between the Moon and Earth passed data at a [...] "record-breaking download rate of 622 megabits per second (Mbps)", and also demonstrated an error-free data upload rate of 20 Mbps from an <b>Earth</b> <b>ground</b> <b>station</b> to LADEE in Lunar orbit.
