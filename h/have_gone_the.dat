500|$|The {{fighting}} {{was focused on}} Munster; Máel Sechnaill sought to increase his influence over the kings there. He took hostages from the province in 854, 856 and 858, {{and the power of}} the over-kings had been weakened in 856 by a Viking raid on the royal centre at Lough Cend, when Gormán son of Lonán, a relative of Munster's over-king, was killed alongside a great many others. This weakness likely drew the gaze of both Máel Sechnaill and the Vikings, and their competition for Munster's resources may have been the cause of the war. Early battles seem to <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>the</b> way of the Vikings: Amlaíb and Ímar [...] "inflicted a rout on Caitill the Fair and his Norse-Irish in the lands of Munster". Although there is no certain evidence to suggest that this Caitill is the same person as the Ketill Flatnose of later sagas, Anderson and Crawford have suggested that they are the same person.|$|E
500|$|The {{circumstances}} of the sinking were featured by a BBC programme. According to this, the despatch of Gloucester, alone and low on fuel and anti-aircraft ammunition (less than 20% remaining), into danger was a [...] "grievous error". Furthermore, the failure to attempt to rescue survivors after dark was [...] "contrary to usual Navy practice". A survivor commented [...] "The tradition in the Navy is that when a ship has sunk, a vessel is sent back to pick up survivors under cover of darkness. That did not happen {{and we do not}} know why. We were picked up by Germans." [...] On 30 May 1941, {{in a letter to the}} First Sea Lord, Sir Dudley Pound, Cunningham wrote, [...] "The sending back of Gloucester and Fiji to the Greyhound was another grave error and cost us those two ships. They were practically out of ammunition but even had they been full up I think they would <b>have</b> <b>gone.</b> <b>The</b> Commanding Officer of Fiji told me that the air over Gloucester was black with planes." ...|$|E

[...] He also said there was room for improvement, [...] "Teams are blitzing us a lot more. We've handled it well for the most part, but there's so many {{things we can do}} better... If you ask every person on this offense, they'll tell you there's something individually they can do better." [...] After the loss to Oklahoma, Mack Brown said {{he did not want to}} hear about bad luck, [...] "By saying we're unlucky is just a cop-out, this game isn't about luck. [...] If you knock balls loose you should get on them. If you tip balls in the air you should catch them. We're not going to have any excuses." [...] Brown cited the lack of big plays on defense, particularly the lack of forced turnovers, as a problem for Texas. [...] Both Brown and Greg Davis hinted that Jamaal Charles could face less playing time as a result of his problems hanging onto the ball.|$|E

2500|$|The A350 was {{publicly}} criticised {{by two of}} Airbus' largest customers, International Lease Finance Corporation (ILFC) and GE Capital Aviation Services (GECAS). On 28 March 2006, ILFC President Steven F. Udvar-Házy urged Airbus {{to pursue}} a clean-sheet design, or risk losing market share to Boeing, branding Airbus's strategy as [...] "a Band-aid reaction to the 787", a sentiment echoed by GECAS president Henry Hubschman. In April 2006, while reviewing bids for the 787 and A350, CEO of Singapore Airlines (SIA) Chew Choon Seng, commented that: [...] "Having gone through the trouble of designing a new wing, tail, cockpit... should <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>the</b> whole hog and designed a new fuselage." [...] Airbus responded by stating they were considering A350 improvements to satisfy customer demands, Airbus's then-CEO Gustav Humbert stated that: [...] "Our strategy isn't driven by {{the needs of the}} next one or two campaigns, but rather by a long-term view of the market and our ability to deliver on our promises." [...] As major airlines such as Qantas and Singapore Airlines selected the 787 over the A350, Humbert tasked an engineering team to produce new alternative designs; one such proposal, known internally as [...] "1d", formed the basis of the A350 redesign.|$|E

2500|$|There was a {{large number}} of benefactions from lay landowners and these often came with {{requests}} to be buried or prayed for at Lilleshall or for membership of the fraternity of the abbey. Late in the 12th century, for example, John Lestrange, a local baron with holdings further afield, got into a dispute with Ramsey Abbey over the church at [...] Holme-next-the-Sea in Norfolk. In a settlement acceptable to all, he gave the church to Lilleshall Abbey, for the health of his own and his wife's souls. Shortly afterwards he added the church at Shangton in Leicestershire, adding specifically “the body of his wife Amicia when she shall <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>the</b> way of all flesh.” Similarly, Robert de Kayley gave the abbey two thirds of his land at Freasley, in Dordon, Warwickshire, on condition that it accept his body for burial. This suggests that its monastic life quickly built up a reputation for holiness that could be acquired by proximity, and one that clearly persisted into the later Middle Ages. John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster, spent two days at the abbey, together with his wife Katherine Swynford and a large retinue. He had fallen ill after the 24th parliament of Richard II's reign was held at Shrewsbury, dissolving on 31 January 1398. Gaunt himself, his wife, and his squire, William Chetwynd, were received into the fraternity, and Gaunt made a gift of twenty pounds of gold.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the height}} of the Malenkov–Khrushchev struggle, Khrushchev {{actively}} fought for improvements in Soviet agriculture and the strengthening {{of the role of the}} Central Committee. Khrushchev tried to revitalise the Central Committee by hosting several discussions on agriculture at the Central Committee plenums. While no other Presidium members were enthusiastic for such an approach, Khrushchev held several Central Committee meetings from February to March 1954 to discuss agriculture alone. By doing this, Khrushchev was acknowledging a long forgotten fact; the Presidium, the Secretariat and he himself were responsible to the Central Committee. Khrushchev could <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>the</b> other way, since some people were already calling for decreasing the Central Committee's role to [...] "cadres and propaganda" [...] alone". A further change was democratisation at the top of the party hierarchy, as Voroshilov noted at a Presidium meeting in 1954. By August 1954 Malenkov's role as de facto head of government was over; Nikolai Bulganin began signing Council of Ministers decrees (a right beholden to the Chairman) and the Presidium gave in to Khrushchev's wishes to replace Malenkov. Malenkov was called of revisionism because of his wishes to prioritise light industry over heavy industry. At the same time, Malenkov was accused of being involved in the Leningrad Affair which led to the deaths of innocent party officials. At the Central Committee plenum of 25 January 1955, Khrushchev accused Malenkov of ideological deviations at the same level as former, anti-Stalinist Bukharin and Alexey Rykov of the 1920s. Malenkov spoke twice to the plenum, but it failed to alter his position, and on 8 March 1955 he was forced to resign from his post as Chairman of the Council of Ministers; he was succeeded by Nikolai Bulganin, a protege of Khrushchev dating back to the 1930s. Malenkov still remained a powerful figure, and he retained his seat in the Presidium.|$|E
