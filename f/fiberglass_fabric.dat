40|$|A {{research}} study was undertaken {{to investigate the}} mechanical performance of glulam beams reinforced by <b>fiberglass</b> <b>fabrics</b> or bamboo. Local reinforcement is proposed {{in order to improve}} the flexural strength and ductility of glulam beams. The glulam beam is strengthened in tension and along its sides with the fiberglass or bamboo. A series of fiberglass-reinforced glulam beams and bamboo-reinforced glulam beams were tested to determine their load-deformation characteristics. Experimental work for evaluating the reinforcing technique is reported here. According to experiment results, the fiberglass and bamboo reinforcements led to a higher glulam beam performance. The results show a considerably improved stiffness of the reinforced over the non-reinforced specimens. By using fibreglass and bamboo reinforcements, several improvements in strength and stiffness may be obtained...|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to fabric construction, fiber type is also {{critical to the}} attributes of barrier materials. Inherently fire resistant fibers (e.g., fiberglass, aramids, melamines, polybenzimidazole (PBI), novoloids, pre-oxidized polyacrylonitriles and carbon fibers) are char forming fibers with high mechanical strength ([Bourbigot & Flambard 2002]) {{that can be used}} for manufacturing barrier fabrics. Fabrics constructed from these inherently flame retardant fibers are expensive, and they are frequently used in high-performance applications (e.g., aircraft seating, seating in other mass transport vehicles and public buildings). Fire barrier <b>fabrics</b> constructed of <b>fiberglass</b> are very effective at preventing an ignition source from reaching the PUF core, as the fiberglass is a high char-forming fabric with strong structural integrity (US Patent Application 20070161312 - Fiberglass fire barrier for mattresses. Filed on January 11 [2006]). <b>Fiberglass</b> <b>fabrics</b> (woven, knitted or non-woven) are often used as substrates for FR coating or laminating FR layers. The disadvantage associated with fiberglass flame barriers is poor durability (due to glass-to-glass abrasion) and lack of resiliency ([Dry et al. 2006]).|$|R
40|$|The tensile {{strength}} and bending strength of natural coir fiber {{are lower than}} many other natural fibers. Therefore, coir fiber is unsuitable for many fiber reinforcement applications. This study exploits the better shock resistance and toughness of coir fiber, which suggest that coir fiber {{can be used as}} a type of replacement material in plywood. Fast-growing poplar was chosen as the surface material, and coir fiber was selected as the core layer material for their buffering ability and toughness, and <b>fiberglass</b> <b>fabrics</b> were added in the core layer as strengthening components. The optimization of this plywood structure was carried out with an orthogonal experiment and the intuitive analysis method. The mechanical performance of some samples even exceeded that of natural wood. Through analysis of test results and scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations, the buffering and toughening mechanisms of the coir fiber mats were revealed. This new material can be used to replace wood in plywood and in the transportation industry as a packaging material and as platform floors for freight vehicles...|$|R

50|$|Micarta is a {{brand name}} for {{composites}} of linen, canvas, paper, fiberglass, carbon fiber or other fabric in a thermosetting plastic. It was originally used in electrical and decorative applications. Micarta was developed by George Westinghouse at least as early as 1910 using phenolic resins invented by Leo Baekeland. These resins were used to impregnate paper and cotton fabric which were cured under pressure and high temperature to produce laminates. In later years this manufacturing method included the use of <b>fiberglass</b> <b>fabric</b> and other resin types were also used. Today Micarta high pressure industrial laminates are produced {{with a wide variety}} of resins and fibers. The term has been used generically for most resin impregnated fibre compounds. Common uses of modern high pressure laminates are as electrical insulators, printed circuit board substrates, and knife handles.|$|E

50|$|California Musical Theatre's Sacramento Music Circus's 10-show {{season in}} 1951 {{included}} newer works Brigadoon, Annie Get Your Gun, and the seminal Show Boat.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{presents an}} automated composite fabric layup solution {{based on a}} new method to deform <b>fiberglass</b> <b>fabric</b> referred to as shifting. A layup system was designed and implemented using a large robotic gantry and custom end-effector for shifting. Layup tests proved that the system can deposit fabric onto two-dimensional and three-dimensional tooling surfaces accurately and repeatedly while avoiding out-of-plane deformation. A process planning method was developed to generate tool paths for the layup system based on a geometric model of the tooling surface. The approach is analogous to Computer Numerical Controlled (CNC) machining, where Numerical Control (NC) code from a Computer-Aided Design (CAD) model is generated to drive the milling machine. Layup experiments utilizing the proposed method were conducted to validate the performance. The {{results show that the}} process planning software requires minimal time or human intervention and can generate tool paths leading to accurate composite fabric layups. <b>Fiberglass</b> <b>fabric</b> samples processed with shifting deformation were observed for meso-scale deformation. Tow thinning, bending and spacing was observed and measured. Overall, shifting did not create flaws in amounts that would disqualify the method from use in industry.

Polyurethane prepolymers were synthesized by reacting molar excess of diphenyl methane diisocyanate (MDI) with polypropylene glycol (PPG) at 60 °C for 2 hours. This effect of different NCO/OH molar ratio and molecular weight of polyol on the tack free time, setting time, diametral compression strength, percent elongation and tensile strength of polyurethane plaster cast were investigated [...] It was observed that with increase in NCO/OH molar ratio, tack free time and setting time of the cast decreases, whereas diametral compression strength increases. Tensile strength was determined in universal testing machine and was found to increase with increasing NCO/OH ratio while opposite trend was observed in case of percent elongation. With increase in polyol molecular weight, tack free time and setting time of the cast increases, whereas diametral compression strength decreases. Blended polyols i. e.

The main goal {{was to develop a}} new soft vacuum system (from 1 torr to 10 torr) that provides an intermediate level of performance (k-value below 4. 8 mW/m-K). Liquid nitrogen boil-off methods were used to test conventional materials, novel materials, and certain combinations. The test articles included combinations of aluminum foil, <b>fiberglass</b> paper, polyester <b>fabric,</b> silica aerogel composite blanket, fumed silica, silica aerogel powder, and syntactic foam. A new LCI system was developed at the Cryogenics Test Laboratory. This system performs exceptionally well at soft vacuum levels and nearly as good as an MLI at high vacuum levels. Apparent thermal conductivities for the LCI range from 2 mW/m-K at soft vacuum to 0. 1 mW/m-K at high vacuum. Several cryostats were designed, constructed, and calibrated by the Cryogenics Test Laboratory at KSC NASA as part of this research program. The cryostat test apparatus is a liquid nitrogen boil-off calorimeter system for direct measurement of the apparent thermal conductivity at a fixed vacuum level between 5 x 10 (exp - 5) and 760 torr.
