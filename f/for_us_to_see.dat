He explained that, if light came from our eyes at a constant velocity it would take much too long to illuminate the stars <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> them while we are still looking at them, {{because they are so}} far away. Therefore, the illumination must be coming from the stars so we can see them as soon as we open our eyes.|$|E
500|$|After {{establishing}} {{himself as}} a premier player in France and an international during the 2004–05 campaign, Benítez declared that Diarra still had a future at Liverpool stating [...] "I think it's still early days for him, but it's good news <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a young player doing so well. If he continues to play well for his club {{and is in the}} national team, we will be reminding everyone he is our player". However, in April 2005, Diarra revealed that he wanted to stay with Lens for the long-term. After finishing the season, on 24 June 2005, Liverpool granted his request after Lens reached an agreement with the club on a transfer fee, purported to be €3.2million. Diarra finished his Liverpool career with no first-team appearances and only one club appearance, which came in a pre-season friendly.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 19th century advocates of women's rights began to {{accumulate}} rebuttals to arguments used against them founded on traditional interpretations of Bible scriptures. Lucretia Mott countered {{those who would}} put her in her place by quoting other Bible passages, or by challenging the original interpretation of the scripture. In 1849, Mott wrote Discourse on Woman which discussed Adam and Eve, the activities of various women who appear in the Bible, and argued that the Bible supported woman's right to speak aloud her spiritual beliefs. Independently from Mott, Lucy Stone determined for herself that the male-dominant interpretations of the Bible must be faulty—she worked to learn Greek and Hebrew and thereby gain insight into the earlier Bible translations which she believed would contain wording more favorable to women's equality. In New York, aided by Mott, Elizabeth Cady Stanton helped draft the Declaration of Sentiments in 1848 and included two Resolutions which protested against man's usurpation of rights relating to her position in church and to her role under God. By the 1850s, Mott had become expert at disarming men who used Scripture against her. At the National Women's Rights Convention in 1852, and again in 1854, she stood up to debate men who came prepared with Scripture in hand. Reverend Henry Grew told the 1854 convention audience that the Bible proved men were naturally superior to women. He was countered point-by-point by Hannah Tracy Cutler, then in broad societal and political terms by Mott who began by saying: [...] "It is not Christianity, but priestcraft that has subjected woman as we find her. The Church and State have been united, and it is well <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> it so." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Hauerwas, a “good {{death is}} a death that we can prepare for through living because {{we are able to}} see that death is but a {{necessary}} correlative to a good life." [...] A long life may give a person more of a chance to have a good death because he {{may be able to get}} himself morally in line during that time period, but it is also possible to die well quickly if you have lived morally. A good death also requires that the death be morally in proportion with the way one lived and was sustained, and occurs in a way that allows those caring <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> that they are sustaining us.|$|E

The United Nations, our world's [...] "figleaf," [...] does not hide the shame of humanity but rather scandalizes humanity's malaise. It is troubling that the League of Nations and the United Nations were born after two world wars. Humanity's unity should come as a natural birth and not as the result of a cesarean section, i.e., through violent global wars. This is reminiscent of the ages of epidemics. Then, because of ignorance about the causes behind these illnesses, plagues swept through communities, leaving millions of dead behind. Yet, after technology made it possible <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> smaller forms of life and medicine brought us a better understanding of germs, communities became better equipped to halt disease and heal the sufferers.|$|E
2500|$|The Royal Coachman {{was first}} made by John Haily a {{professional}} fly dresser living in New York City. In writing of other matters, he enclosed this fly <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>see,</b> saying [...] "A gentleman {{wanted me to}} tie up some Coachman {{for him to take}} to the north woods and to make them extra strong, so I have tied them with a little band of silk in the middle to prevent the peacock bodies from fraying out. I have also added a tail of the barred feathers of the wood-duck, and I think it makes a very handsome fly." [...] A few evenings later, a circle of us were together [...] "disputing the fly in question", one of the party claiming that numbers were [...] "quite as suitable to designate the flies as so many nonsensical names". The others did not agree with him, but he said: [...] "What can you do? Here is a fly intended to be a Coachman; {{but it is not the}} true Coachman; it is quite unlike it and what can you call it?" [...] Mr. L. C. Orvis, brother of Mr. Charles Orvis, who was present said: [...] "Oh that is easy enough; call it the Royal Coachman it is so finely dressed!" [...] And this name in time came to be known and used by all who are familiar with the fly.|$|E
2500|$|Additionally, in Disciplining {{investment}} Bankers, Disciplining the Economy: Wall Street's Institutional Culture of Crisis and the Downsizing of [...] "Corporate America", Karen Ho {{states that}} {{as we continue to}} learn more about Wall Street, we learn about each independent banker. As the banker brings their life experiences into the business, we can see the reasons for their actions. Each investor has a unique identity which contributes to the culture of Wall Street. Ideally, they live in the moment. [...] However, job insecurity and the volatile nature of the market creates a constant state of fear within the investor. Therefore, they must organize themselves and follow a pattern to ensure security, profit and prosperity for the long run. Karen Ho wishes <b>for</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Wall Street through the lens of the everyday investor and banker, as well as understand the experiences and everyday situations that they must endure. Ho also believes that the individuals within the public can counteract the stereotypes and negativity that both the media and society associates with Wall Street by learning more about the personal experiences of the investors and their everyday lives. Similarly to regular wage earners, Wall Street employees are just trying to earn a day's pay. Their work is sometimes undervalued, because the public does not see them in this manner. Thus, Wall Street cannot be understood in black and white terms. One needs to understand that they have a value system which is not only logical to them, but also reflective of North America's values of individual power, prestige, and social practices based on individualism. For example, throughout the 1940s and into the 1950s Manhattan was a [...] "white-only" [...] community. [...] Within that time period, {{there was a lot of}} racial segregation. The values of America and the social practices were not like they are today, so African Americans were not within the Wall Street community.|$|E

[...] Lisa Cohen offered similarly strong praise, hailing The Emigrants “uncanny vividness and specificity,” concluding that “the brilliance of this book {{lies in the fact}} that Sebald never loses sight of either the power of metaphor or the viciousness of history.” Daniel Medin noted in 2003 that [...] "Hulses 1996 translation of Die Ausgewanderten introduced Sebald to audiences beyond...German readership, and Sebald was hailed immediately as a new and compelling voice in contemporary European fiction." ...|$|R
