40|$|The dynamic {{characteristics}} of <b>joint</b> <b>interfaces</b> have {{significant effect on}} both static and dynamic behaviors of the whole machine tool structures. Its dynamic model can be simplified {{as a group of}} equivalent spring-damping elements, that is, an ‘elastic interlayer’ without mass. The unit area dynamic characteristic parameters are the key to analyze the dynamic properties of <b>joint</b> <b>interfaces.</b> However, when building the stiffness and damping matrices of the <b>joint</b> <b>interfaces,</b> the interaction between the ‘elastic interlayer’ and the conjunctions are always ignored, which leads to errors arising. A test system for identifying the unit area dynamic characteristic parameters of different kinds of <b>joint</b> <b>interfaces</b> are represented based on Equivalent Single Degree Of Freedom (ESDOF) system theory. The unit area dynamic characteristic parameters can be applied under all kinds of conditions (including different materials, pre-tightening force, surface roughness, lubricating conditions, media, etc).

The presented method is compared with the conventional method on analyzing the vibration behavior of an assembled beam structure.

50|$|There are {{different}} crew duty positions an air battle manager may be qualified to perform during his career.

This position also has several jobs that {{can be considered a}} position during a military operation,i.e. strike controller, OCA, DCA. From there, ABMs may upgrade to several different positions, depending on the platform they are serving on. Two positions common to all platforms are the senior director, who directs the weapons section (consisting of weapon directors and AWOs), and the mission crew commander, a senior ABM who controls the entire operations crew. ABMs in charge of the surveillance section are called air surveillance officers on the E-3, or sensor management officers on the E-8. The electronic combat officer, another upgrade position for AWOs,is only found on the AWACS platform and is in charge of operating certain sensors aboard the E-3 as well as infusing electronic war fare information and intelligence reports on and off the E-3 as well as expedite the F2T2EA process between strategic and tactical assets. ABMs may also serve as instructors and evaluators in whatever crew position qualification they maintain. With addition to their flying duties, ABMs also have office duties within their respective line squadron.

The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the influence of <b>joint</b> <b>interface</b> on mechanical behavior of two cylinders by modeling different geometry with Finite Element Method (FEM). The structures are continuum model (CM), <b>joint</b> <b>interface</b> model with different materials (JIM 1) and <b>joint</b> <b>interface</b> model with same materials (JIM 2). The displacement-load relationship, equivalent plastic strain (EPS), deformation and contact pressure based on three models are gained. FEM results indicate that under the same load, the displacements of three models are various in loading and unloading processes. The EPSCM is relative stable originally and then decerase quickly while the EPSJIM 1 and EPSJIM 2 grow rapidly and fall slowly later. The deformation of CM, JIM 1 and JIM 2 under 300 Mpa are 62. 5 µm, 33 µm and 68. 13 µm respectively. The contact pressure of JIM 1 is smaller than JIM 2. The effects of frictional coefficients (vary from 0 to 1. 0) on deformation and contact pressure are also investigated.

Electromigration is found to have significant effects {{not only on the}} phase formation at the <b>joint</b> <b>interface</b> but also on the phase coarsening and mass accumulation of Bi in the solder. In the solder joint without the current stressing, only a thin Ni 3 Sn 4 phase was formed at the <b>joint</b> <b>interface.</b> For the solder joint with the current stressing, in addition to the Ni 3 Sn 4 phase, a thick Au-Ni-Bi-Sn phase was formed at the <b>joint</b> <b>interface</b> after 10 days.

40|$|A general {{interface}} {{element is}} developed for dynamic response analysis of structures with jointed interfaces, which {{can account for}} damping due to both impact and friction. Contact effects are included through a segment-to-segment contact model which considers the stick-slip-slap behavior at every point along the <b>joint</b> <b>interface.</b> A nonlinear friction law is adopted at the interface to describe microscopic relative motion due to the deformation of the asperities on the interface.

40|$|International audienceReal {{applications}} in structural mechanics where the dynamic behavior is linear are rare. Usually, structures {{are made of}} components assembled together by means of joints whose behavior maybe highly nonlinear. Depending {{on the amount of}} excitation, joints can dramatically change the dynamic behavior of the whole system, and the modeling of this type of constraint is therefore crucial for a correct prediction of the amount of vibration. The solution of the nonlinear equilibrium equations by means of the Harmonic Balance Method (HBM) is widely accepted as an effective approach to calculate the steady-state forced response in the frequency domain, in spite of Direct Time Integration (DTI). The state-of-the-art contact element used to model the friction forces at the <b>joint</b> <b>interfaces</b> is a node-to-node contact element, where the local contact compliance is modeled by means of linear springs and Coulomb's law is used to govern the friction phenomena. In the literature, when the HBM is applied to vibrating systems with <b>joint</b> <b>interfaces</b> and the state-of-the-art contact model is used, an uncoupled approach is mostly employed: the static governing equations are solved in advance to compute the pre-stress effects and then the dynamic governing equations are solved to predict the vibration amplitude of the system. As a result, the HBM steady-state solution may lead to a poor correlation with the DTI solution, where static and dynamic loads are accounted for simultaneously. In this paper, the HBM performances are investigated by comparing the uncoupled approach to a fully coupled static/dynamic approach. In order to highlight the main differences between the two approaches, a lumped parameter system, characterized by a single friction contact, is considered in order to show the different levels of accuracy that the proposed approaches can provide for different configurations...|$|R
