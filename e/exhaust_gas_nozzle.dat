50|$|A {{rocket engine}} nozzle is a {{propelling}} nozzle (usually of the de Laval type) {{used in a}} rocket engine to expand and accelerate the combustion gases produced by burning propellants so that the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> exit the <b>nozzle</b> at hypersonic velocities.|$|R
40|$|An upwind, {{implicit}} Navier-Stokes {{computer program}} {{has been applied to}} hypersonic exhaust plume/afterbody flowfields. The sensitivity of gross thrust to operating conditions has been assessed through parametric variations. Comparison of the numerical results with available experimental data shows good agreement in all cases investigated. Results show that, for moderately underexpanded jets, the afterbody force varies linearly with the <b>nozzle</b> exit pressure. <b>Exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> with low isentropic exponents (gamma) were found to contribute up to 25 percent more afterbody force than high-gamma <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases.</b> Modifying the <b>nozzle</b> geometry influenced the exhaust plume development, which had a significant effect on the afterbody force. Grid density, while important to resolving the initial plume/afterbody interaction, had only a minor impact on the resultant afterbody force...|$|R
50|$|The nozzle {{operates}} in two distinct modes: open and closed. In closed wake mode, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> fills the entire nozzle exit area. The ambient pressure {{at which the}} wake changes from open to closed modes is called the design pressure. If the ambient pressure reduces any further, additional expansion will occur outside the nozzle much like a standard bell nozzle and no altitude compensation effect will be gained. In open wake mode, the exit area {{is dependent on the}} ambient pressure and the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> exits the <b>nozzle</b> as an annulus as it does not fill the entire nozzle. Because the ambient pressure controls the exit area, the area ratio should be perfectly compensating to the altitude up to the design pressure.|$|R

40|$|Dual bell nozzle permits two {{different}} operating modes, which provide higher performance than conventional bell nozzles, {{when applied to}} rocket engines operating in a varying ambient pressure environment. The conﬁguration of a dual bell nozzle in the cryogenic engine of the Ariane 5 main stage, could {{be based on the}} injection of the turbine <b>exhaust</b> <b>gases</b> in the <b>nozzle,</b> to increase the thrust and to cool the wall. The effectiveness of the ﬁlm cooling is evaluated by a parametric study and in particular, the effect of the secondary gas injection on the overall ﬂow behavior is studied because of its possible effect {{on one of the most}} critical aspects of dual bell nozzles, the side loads, that may occur during the separated ﬂow operations and during the transition between the two operating modes...|$|R
40|$|Simulations of {{exhaust nozzle}} flows are {{typically}} conducted assuming the gas is calorically perfect, and typically modeled as air. However the gas inside a real nozzle is generally composed of combustion products whose thermodynamic properties may differ. In this study, {{the effect of}} gas model assumption on exhaust nozzle simulations is examined. The three methods considered model the <b>nozzle</b> <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> as calorically perfect air, a calorically perfect <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> mixture, and a frozen <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> mixture. In the latter case the individual non-reacting species are tracked and modeled as a gas which is only thermally perfect. Performance parameters such as mass flow rate, gross thrust, and thrust coefficient are compared as are mean flow and turbulence profiles in the jet plume region. Nozzles which operate at low temperatures or have low subsonic exit Mach numbers experience relatively minor temperature variations inside the nozzle, and may be modeled as a calorically perfect gas. In those which operate at the opposite extreme conditions, variations in the thermodynamic properties can lead to different expansion behavior within the nozzle. Modeling these cases as a perfect <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> flow rather than air captures much of the flow features of the frozen chemistry simulations. Use of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> reduces the <b>nozzle</b> mass flow rate, but has {{little effect on the}} gross thrust. When reporting nozzle thrust coefficient results, however, it is important to use the appropriate gas model assumptions to compute the ideal exit velocity. Otherwise the values obtained may be an overly optimistic estimate of nozzle performance...|$|R
40|$|The key {{demand on}} future space {{transportation}} systems is the concurrent reduction of Earth-to-orbit launch costs and increase of launcher reliability and operational efficiency. A common way of slightly improving performance of gas-generator open-cycle engines is the injection of the turbine <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> into the <b>nozzle</b> divergent section, {{which is also}} used for wall film cooling. The present study focuses on a numerical parametric analysis of the film-cooling efficiency in dual-bell <b>nozzles.</b> The secondary <b>gas</b> injection {{is made in the}} first bell, and it is found that the expansion fan originating from the inflection helps the film to better protect the wall. The results of fully-attached-flow simulations are also used to study the influence of film cooling on the expected behavior of nozzle side loads during operation with separated flow in the second bell.

Individual cells alternately open and close the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> and fresh air apertures. When the aperture on the <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> side is reached, pressurized <b>exhaust</b> <b>gas</b> flows into the cell and compresses the fresh air there.
