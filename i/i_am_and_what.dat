5|$|After {{having my}} own child, it's pretty amazing what females are capable of. We're Supergirl, {{we do it}} all: we give the love, we give the milk. On the other hand, I'm running a business. I'm running my career. That comes with being labeled a bitch. If that's what I'm gonna be called by being {{assertive}} and knowing who <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> I want out of life, then so be it. I will wear that label proudly. For me it's about turning that word into a positive.|$|E
500|$|... "Soul Sound" [...] {{was written}} by the Scottish {{musician}} Charlotte Gordon Cumming during her trip to Kenya. Her inspiration to write the song stemmed from Africa, a continent which she visited frequently with her family as a child. According to Cumming, [...] "In Africa I feel extremely alive, but also very small. The song was the essence of how I felt: seeing the beauty and horror of a place, and going into a heightened state." [...] She elaborated, [...] "My songs are all about who <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> I am feeling, {{which is why they}} can take so much out of me to perform – and I always feel a lot when I go to Africa".|$|E
500|$|Green Day {{began to}} write new songs for what would become 21st Century Breakdown in January 2006 after touring {{extensively}} in 2005 in support of their seventh studio album American Idiot. At the time, frontman Billie Joe Armstrong stated: [...] "We'll start with silence, and that's how we'll {{be able to find}} the inspiration to find another record." [...] The band did not release any details of the writing and recording process until October 2007, when Armstrong {{said in an interview with}} Rolling Stone that he had written [...] "something like 45 songs". The band members worked on the primitive conceptual stages of the album at their rehearsal studio in Oakland, California. Little was revealed on the themes or musical style of the album, but Armstrong stated: [...] "I want to dig into who <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> I'm feeling at this moment – which is middle-aged." [...] He added that many of the 45 songs were written on piano rather than guitar.|$|E

500|$|Once {{she became}} Secretary of State, Clinton's image seemed to improve {{dramatically}} among the American public and {{become one of}} a respected world figure. She gained consistently high approval ratings (by 2011, the highest of her career except during the Lewinsky scandal), and her favorable-unfavorable ratings during 2010 and 2011 were the highest of any active, nationally prominent American political figure. A 2012 Internet meme, [...] "Texts from Hillary", was based around a photograph of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone and imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It achieved viral popularity among younger, technically adept followers of politics. Clinton sought to explain her popularity by saying in early 2012, [...] "There's a certain consistency to who <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> I do and I think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now. She continued {{to do well in}} Gallup's most admired man and woman poll and in 2015 she was named the most admired woman by Americans for a record fourteenth straight time and twentieth time overall.|$|E
2500|$|Hirsh is Jewish, and {{he keeps}} track of all the Jewish players in major league baseball. [...] In 2007, the Rockies had a strong Christian {{influence}} in their clubhouse; The New York Times said, [...] "Christianity rocks in Colorado's clubhouse." [...] On this, Hirsh said, [...] "There are guys who are religious, sure, but they don’t impress it upon anybody. It’s not like they hung a cross in my locker or anything. They’ve accepted me for who <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> I believe in." ...|$|E
2500|$|I am who <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> I {{believe in}} and what my spirituality is about is that we're all in this together.

Life is more than that. In 2016, he stated he had [...] "very strong religious and spiritual feelings" [...] and explained, [...] "My spirituality is that we are all in this together and that when children go hungry, when veterans sleep out on the street, it impacts me." ...|$|E
5000|$|In his obituary, it was {{reported}} that Shi Pei Pu disliked answering questions about the sexual specifics of the affair; in 1988 he was quoted in an interview as having said, [...] "I used to fascinate both men <b>and</b> women. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> they <b>were</b> didn’t matter." ...|$|R

2500|$|In November 2011, Grey {{participated in}} the Guest Reading Program at Emerson Elementary School in Compton, California. Reportedly, her {{involvement}} in such activity was first denied to the media by school officials. Parents were upset that a former pornographic actress would read to their children {{as part of an}} education program. She responded to the controversy by stating, [...] "I believe education is a universal right. I committed to this program with the understanding that people would have their own opinions about what I have done, who <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> I represent." [...] Grey also appeared on the American talk show The View, where she explained that she thought the parents should have been given prior notice of the identity of anyone who did guest reading, and that if parents had objected to her, she would not have done it.|$|E
2500|$|During the 1998 NFL Draft, Moss, who was {{projected}} {{as a high}} first-round pick, {{was taken}} by the Minnesota Vikings with the 21st overall pick after a number of NFL clubs—even those in need of a WR—were concerned with Moss' well-documented legal problems. Before the draft Moss was quoted as saying teams that passed on him [...] "will regret it once they see what kind of a player <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> kind of guy I really am." [...] The team most often cited for passing on Moss is the Dallas Cowboys. Moss grew up a Cowboys fan and wanted to play for the Cowboys. The Cowboys wanted Moss, but because of many off-field incidents of their own, team owner and GM Jerry Jones did not feel the team could draft Moss. [...] Moss felt that the Cowboys lied to him because they had told him they would draft him. On draft day, Dallas {{went so far as to}} have a scout in Charleston, West Virginia, the same town where Moss and his mother were watching the draft. Dallas star receiver Michael Irvin even called to apologize to Moss, because Irvin's own off-field problems were a main reason Moss was not drafted by Dallas. [...] After the draft, Moss made a point of beating the Cowboys any time he faced them, getting his first opportunity to do so in Week 13 of his rookie season. In a game held at Texas Stadium, Moss torched Dallas with a 163-yard, 3-touchdown performance.|$|E
2500|$|In April 2012, an Internet meme [...] "Texts from Hillary", hosted on Tumblr {{and based}} around a {{photograph}} of Clinton sitting on a military plane wearing sunglasses and using a mobile phone, imagined the recipients and contents of her text messages. It became suddenly popular and earned the endorsement of Clinton herself, before being brought to an end by its creators. Obama himself took note of the meme's popularity, in a humorous exchange that revealed the ease the two now had around one another. Around the same time, a photograph taken during the 6th Summit of the Americas in Cartagena, Colombia, showed Clinton {{with a group of}} colleagues relaxing, drinking Águila beer from a bottle and dancing, at a local nightclub. The episode gained front-page attention from the New York Post and illustrated how Clinton was enjoying the job. Regarding her ongoing popularity, Clinton said, [...] "There's a certain consistency to who <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>and</b> <b>what</b> I do, and I think people have finally said, 'Well, you know, I kinda get her now.'" [...] One long-time Washington figure summarized the situation by simply saying, [...] "There's no coin in criticizing her anymore." [...] At the same time, her fashion choices gained renewed attention, with her hair grown long and sometimes pulled back with scrunchies. Public commentary on Clinton's hair was now a tradition across twenty years, but as one female State Department traveller said, [...] "As a chick, it's a big pain in the butt. The weather is different, and you’re {{in and out of the}} plane. [...] gets off that plane looking like garbage most days, but she has to look camera ready. She said the reason she grew her hair long was that it's easier. She has options." [...] Clinton professed she was past the point of concern on the matter: [...] "I feel so relieved to be at the stage I'm at in my life right now, [...] because if I want to wear my glasses, I'm wearing my glasses. If I want to pull my hair back, I'm pulling my hair back." [...] In any case, Clinton showed a much more relaxed attitude vis a vis the press than in past eras.|$|E

5000|$|An {{accompanying}} book of {{sheet music}} Songbook - The Book was also released.
