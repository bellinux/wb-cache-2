50|$|A twistgrip is {{a handle}} {{that can be}} twisted to operate a control. It is {{commonly}} found as a motorcycle's right <b>handlebar</b> <b>grip</b> to control the throttle, but is sometimes found elsewhere, such as on a bicycle as a gearshift, and in helicopters.|$|E
5000|$|Miami Hopper: The rider {{stands on}} the pedals and grasps the seat tip in right hand, and the front brake lever in left hand. The rider quickly applies the front brake and {{simultaneously}} rotates the handlebars 90 degrees counterclockwise towards the seat and pulls up sharply on the seat. This will cause {{the rear of the}} bike to rise up and seemingly flip over the front. If landed correctly, the front wheel will lay parallel to the ground and the right <b>handlebar</b> <b>grip</b> will be balancing on the ground leaving the rider perched above the rear wheel. From this position, the rider can make various poses, kick the bike out to the side and lay it down, or lean back sharply and reverse the trick and ride away. *note* the hands and handlebar directions would be reversed if the bike was set up with the front brake lever on the right hand side.

40|$|Title: Electromyographic Analysis of the Different <b>Handlebars</b> <b>Grips</b> Effect on the Shoulder Blade Fixators Aims: The main {{objective}} of this thesis is {{to carry out a}} methodological study on the impact of different <b>handlebars</b> <b>grips</b> on the shoulder blades fixators. Result of the grip change is not only reduction of the upper fixators activity and the increase in the lower fixators activity but also co-contraction index increase and muscle fatigue reduction. Based on the hypothesis we assumed that the highest activity rate of the lower blades fixators and the lowest activity rate of the upper blades fixators will be during the <b>handlebars</b> brakes <b>grip.</b> The highest co- contraction index will occur during the <b>handlebar</b> brakes <b>grip</b> and the maximum muscular fatigue will occur during the grip {{at the top of the}} handlebars. The first part of the thesis is focused on the literature search and facts retrieval pertaining to the studied issue. In the second special part of the thesis we conducted a research during which the muscle activity of the upper and lower blade fixators was recorded. Three different <b>handlebars</b> <b>grips</b> were considered during the measurement using the cycle ergometer. Methods: Muscle activity was scanned and recorded using surface EMG. Maximal voluntary contraction of selected muscles based on [...] ...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} {{presented}} {{a study on}} the discrimination of <b>handlebar</b> <b>grip</b> samples, to provide effective forensic science service for hit and run traffic cases. 50 bicycle <b>handlebar</b> <b>grip</b> samples, 49 electric bike <b>handlebar</b> <b>grip</b> samples, and 96 motorcycle <b>handlebar</b> <b>grip</b> samples have been randomly collected by the local police in Beijing (China). Fourier transform infrared microspectroscopy (FTIR) was utilized as analytical technology. Then, target absorption selection, data pretreatment, and discrimination of linked samples and unlinked samples were chosen as three steps to improve the discrimination of FTIR spectrums collected from different <b>handlebar</b> <b>grip</b> samples. Principal component analysis and receiver operating characteristic curve were utilized to evaluate different data selection methods and different data pretreatment methods, respectively. It is possible to explore the evidential value of <b>handlebar</b> <b>grip</b> residue evidence through instrumental analysis and statistical treatments.

The 'M' and 'H' handlebars changed, with a switch to Brompton-designed integrated brake + bell + shifter + gear design units hung below the new handelbars. The handlebars retained the same overall height, {{but with a}} handlebar stem 20mm higher, meaning 20mm less rise required on the handlebars, and a smoother curve. The 'M', 'H' and flat 'S' handlebars switched to using longer and removal <b>handlebar</b> <b>grips.</b>|$|R

50|$|Cycling {{places a}} good deal of stress on the hands, in the form of {{prolonged}} pressure against handlebars and transmission of sudden road shocks through handlebars to the hands. The severity of discomfort can be mitigated somewhat by riding position, but is essentially inherent in most designs of upright bicycle. However, choice of weight distribution between the saddle and handlebars is usually determined by other factors, such as aerodynamics, control and long-term comfort. Padded gloves or <b>handlebar</b> <b>grips</b> are therefore useful to increase comfort for a given geometry.|$|R
50|$|Previous BMW {{motorcycles}} {{used the}} airhead engines {{such as the}} type 247 air-cooled flat-twin with two pushrod-activated valves per cylinder. The R1100GS engine introduced partial oil-cooling and four valves per cylinder operated by a single chain-driven camshaft. Motronic fuel injection was included instead of the carburettors found on earlier bikes. Rear suspension and driveshaft used the same Paralever swingarm system as the previous bikes, but {{with the addition of}} remote pre-load adjustment on the shock absorber. Front suspension used a new A-arm system called Telelever. Options included heated <b>handlebar</b> <b>grips</b> and ABS.|$|R

50|$|Jannard {{was born}} in Los Angeles but was raised in Alhambra, California, {{the son of a}} pharmacist, and {{graduated}} from Alhambra High School. Jannard attended the USC School of Pharmacy but dropped out to travel the southwestern U.S. on a motorcycle. In 1975, he started a one-man business selling motorcycle parts out of his car at motocross events. He named his company after his dog, Oakley. He began developing his own products: first, custom <b>handlebar</b> <b>grips</b> that conformed to the shape of one's hand and later motorcycle goggles, ski goggles, and sunglasses. One model of sunglasses was used by bicycle racer Greg LeMond, raising Oakley's profile. In the 1980s, he restricted the sale of Oakley sunglasses to the Sunglass Hut (although small specialty shops could continue to sell Oakley sunglasses). In 1991, his company had 200 employees. In 1995, the company went public.|$|R

5000|$|In 2011, Honda {{released}} a new Honda CBR600F model built in Italy for the European markets {{that was not}} released in America. It continues {{the legacy of the}} CBR model F line. To honor the German rider Stefan Bradl, Honda Germany launched a special edition of the CBR600F the CBR600F LCR. It featured an Arrow titanium exhaust Progrip <b>handlebar</b> <b>grips,</b> a rear hugger and single seat cover and an LCR sticker kit as well as combined braking and ABS. The CBR600F shares most of the components of the naked CB600F 'Hornet' such as inverted fork though longer by 50mm and aluminium Mono-backbone frame. But wraps it in a multi-layered full fairing that lowers drag and protects the rider from windblast as well as new instruments, bars, and tank. It also retains a similar relaxed seating position to minimise rider fatigue. [...] The 2011 CBR600F also shares the engine of the highly revised CB600F model that came out in April 2007. This engine is a detuned version of that which is available in the 2007 CBR600RR giving a maximum output power of approximately 102 bhp (76 kW) at 12,000 rpm and [...] of torque at 10,500 rpm.|$|R

40|$|Adequate dental {{and oral}} hygiene {{may become a}} {{challenge}} for all users and especially for elderly people and young children because of their limited motor skills. The {{same holds true for}} patients undergoing/recovering from chemo-/radiotherapy with accompanying sensitive mucosal conditions. Poor dental hygiene can result in tooth decay, gingivitis, periodontitis, tooth loss, bad breath (halitosis), fungal infection and gum diseases. The use of a toothbrush is the most important measure for oral hygiene. Toothbrushes with soft bristles operated carefully by hand or via an electric device help to remove plaque and to avoid mucosal trauma. A <b>handlebar</b> with a <b>grip</b> cover can be helpful for manually disabled patients or for those with reduced motor skills. In case of oral hygiene at the bedside or of patients during/after chemo-/radiotherapy a gauze pad can be helpful for gently cleaning the teeth, gums and tongue. The use of fluoride toothpaste is imperative for the daily oral hygiene. Detergents such as sodium lauryl sulphate improve the cleaning action but may also dehydrate and irritate the mucous membrane. The use of products containing detergents and flavouring agents (peppermint, menthol, cinnamon) should therefore be avoided by bedridden patients or those with dry mouth and sensitive mucosa. Aids for suitable interdental cleaning, such as dental floss, interdental brushes or dental sticks, are often complicated to operate. Their correct use should be instructed by healthcare professionals. To support dental care, additional fluoridation with a fluoride gel or rinse can be useful. Products further containing antiseptics such as chlorhexidine or triclosan reduce the quantity of bacteria in the mouth. For patients undergoing or having undergone radio-/chemotherapy, a mouthwash that concomitantly moisturizes the oral mucosa is advisable...|$|R
500|$|According to the Smithsonian, Roper's first {{velocipede}} of 1867–1869 used {{a purpose}} built frame rather than adapting an existing velocipede frame by retrofitting a steam engine, but one contemporary newspaper account does assert that Roper repurposed a velocipede frame, and Setright and motoring author Roland Brown say Roper used a hickory wood frame {{built by the}} Hanlon Brothers, who made and demonstrated boneshakers at fairs and circuses, although the Smithsonian's Roper has an iron frame. It had a wheelbase of [...] and two [...] diameter wheels made of iron bands on wooden s with wooden spokes. It had a rigid, forged iron fork, and a solid <b>handlebar</b> with wooden <b>grips.</b> Unlike the modern twistgrip, where the grip on only one side is a sleeve that rotates around the handlebar to open the throttle, the Roper velocipede's entire bar was rotated with both hands, {{and it had a}} dual function. When turned forward, the throttle opened, and when turned backwards it applied the spoon brake on the front wheel. The seat doubled as the water reservoir; or the water tank can be described as saddle shaped. A hand pump transferred water from this tank to the boiler. The boiler was between the wheels with a [...] "nautical looking" [...] chimney from the boiler angling backwards behind the rider, with the firebox in the lower half of this housing, all of which hung from the frame with a spring to absorb shock, while two stay rods attached the bottom of the housing {{to the back of the}} frame. There were three water level cocks on the left side, near the water pump, and a drain valve on the bottom. The two cylinders, with bores of about [...] were located on either side of the frame, from the upper part of the boiler near the chimney, connecting to [...] cranks on the rear wheel. Exhaust steam, conveyed by tubing to the base of the chimney, provided a forced draft.|$|R
