5|$|Blood-C was {{designed}} to share only thematic similarities with earlier Blood projects. CLAMP was brought on board to both design the characters and help create the scenario. It featured several new elements to the Blood franchise, such as being primarily set within a high school environment. The Elder Bairns were inspired by the <b>Great</b> <b>Old</b> Ones from H. P. Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos, and modeled after traditional Japanese monsters. Its bloody violence, a stylistic choice following the series' themes, resulted in censorship in Japan and eventual blacklisting in China. The series has received mixed to positive reviews from journalists.|$|E

25|$|The Frankish realm under Charles Martel was the {{foremost}} military power of Western Europe. During {{most of his}} tenure in office as commander-in-chief of the Franks, it consisted of north and eastern France (Austrasia, Neustria and Burgundy), most of western Germany, and the Low Countries (Luxembourg, Belgium and the Netherlands). The Frankish realm had begun to progress towards becoming the first real imperial power in western Europe {{since the fall of}} Rome. However, it continued to struggle against external forces such as the Saxons, Frisians, and other opponents such as the Basque-Aquitanians led by Odo the <b>Great</b> (<b>Old</b> French: Eudes), Duke over Aquitaine and Vasconia.|$|E

25|$|Cnut the <b>Great</b> (<b>Old</b> Norse: Knútr inn ríki; c. 995 – 12 November 1035), {{also known}} as Canut—whose father was Sweyn Forkbeard (which gave him the patronym Sweynsson, Old Norse: Sveinsson)—was King of Denmark, England and Norway; {{together}} {{often referred to as}} the North Sea Empire. With the deaths of his heirs within a decade of his own, and Norman conquest of England in 1066, this legacy was mostly forgotten. He is popularly invoked in the context of the legend of King Canute and the waves, which usually misrepresents him as a deluded monarch believing he has supernatural powers, contrary to the original legend which portrays a wise king who rebuked his courtiers for their fawning behaviour.|$|E
25|$|In 1460, Sir Thomas {{built the}} <b>great</b> <b>Old</b> Hall in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire. Gainsborough Old Hall {{was not only}} their home, but also a {{demonstration}} of their wealth and importance. Sir Thomas was a great benefactor to Newark Church and also {{the founder of the}} Chantry and Alms House at Gainsborough. In 1470, the manor was attacked by Sir Robert Welles over a clash about lands, status, and honour, but it was not severely damaged. It was in 1484 that Sir Thomas entertained King Richard III in his hall. Today, the Hall with its elaborate timber roof survives as well as the kitchen—possibly the most complete medieval kitchen in England. The Hall is over five hundred years old {{and one of the best}} preserved medieval manor houses in England.|$|E
500|$|... "Pittsburgh Town", {{sometimes}} titled as [...] "Pittsburgh" [...] or [...] "Pittsburgh is a <b>Great</b> <b>Old</b> Town", is a {{folk song}} written by Woody Guthrie and originally recorded by Pete Seeger. The song was written during a Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania stop on an Almanac Singers' tour; both Seeger and Gutherie {{were members of}} the band at this time. The song speaks of the labor and environmental problems that the city was facing in 1941, when the song was written. In the time since, environmental legislation has reduced the pollution problem that plagued Pittsburgh; because of this, the song's mentions of pollution in Pittsburgh have been sometimes been replaced with verses extolling the city.|$|E

500|$|In 1959, Vivien Richman {{released}} {{an adaptation of}} the song on her album Vivien Richman Sings Folk Songs of West Pennsylvania; her version of the song includes several additional verses about the landscape and geography of the region. The song has also been covered by students at Pittsburgh Public Schools, using verses that are less political than the original Guthrie composition {{and closer to the}} Richman version than the Seeger version. The change in verses was partly because {{by the middle of the}} 1950s, enforcement of the Smoke Control Ordinance of 1941 cleaned up the air. [...] Lyrics about the smokiness of the town were replaced with the line [...] "Pittsburgh town is a <b>great</b> <b>old</b> town." ...|$|E
500|$|The series' music {{editor and}} main {{composer}} is Nicolas Carr. After working with Hillenburg on Rocko's Modern Life, Carr {{struggled to find}} a new job in his field. He had been considering a career change when Hillenburg offered him the job. The first season's score primarily featured selections from the Associated Production Music Library, which Carr has said includes [...] "lots of <b>great</b> <b>old</b> corny Hawaiian music and big, full, dramatic orchestral scores." [...] Rocko's Modern Life also used music from this library. It was Hillenburg's decision to adopt the approach. The selections for SpongeBob SquarePants have been described by Carr as being [...] "more over-the-top" [...] than those for Rocko's Modern Life.|$|E
500|$|Central to {{this story}} are Les Invisibles (The Invisible Ones), a group of seven beings worshipped by the natives of Mexico and Haiti prior {{to the arrival of}} Spanish colonists in the 16th century, {{identified}} by some fans as the Loa of the Voodoo religion. The nature of Les Invisibles is left unclear, though it is hinted that they may be extraterrestrials, or beings akin to the <b>Great</b> <b>Old</b> Ones in the works of H. P. Lovecraft. An interpretation of the lyrics of the song [...] "Astronomy" [...] by some fans suggests that the star Sirius is of particular astrological significance to Les Invisibles, with clues identifying it as their place of origin; it is during the so-called Dog Days of August, when Sirius is in conjunction with the Sun that their influence over mankind is at its apex. By subtly influencing the minds of men, the beings are said to be [...] "playing with our history as if it's a game", affecting events in world history over the course of centuries. For the three centuries after European discovery of the New World, this game plays out as the desire for gold is used to transform Spain into the dominant power in Europe, only to be usurped by England in the 17th century and later, through technology, by other nations ("Les Invisibles").|$|E

500|$|The {{design of}} the main cast was handled by CLAMP. According to Mizushima, the team wanted to portray Saya in a far more human way than her {{previous}} incarnations, ending up creating a character more human then even the true human characters. Saya's character as a long-haired, song-singing meganekko (girl in glasses) almost entirely created by CLAMP. Due to the stark differences between this version of Saya and previous versions, Fujisaku did not used her original surname [...] "Otonashi", so viewers could clearly distinguish Saya's portrayal from previous entries. When deciding upon her strength, Mizushima decided to use Hit-Girl from the movie Kick-Ass as a role model, making Saya stronger than Hit-Girl while also putting her into a high school environment. The animation character designer was Kazuchika Kise, who worked on Blood: The Last Vampire. Yasuomi Umetsu directed and worked on the storyboard for the game's opening along with Kise. A {{key part of the}} opening was a layer of blood peeling away from Saya's naked form. While compared by many to the opening of Ghost in the Shell, Umetsu said that it represented Saya's personal evolution {{during the course of the}} show. The Elder Bairns were designed by Tomohiro Shinoda. They were initially conceived by Ohkawa as Japanese versions of the <b>Great</b> <b>Old</b> Ones, figures from the Cthulhu Mythos created by H. P. Lovecraft. While some elements remained from the initial concept, the Elder Bairns' physical forms as faced by Saya were inspired by yokai from Japanese folklore at Mizushima's insistence—this design choice was decided upon after Jizo finished storyboarding the fight against the first episode's Elder Bairn, which was modeled after a Jizo statue. This initial concept was expanded upon by Mizushima, Ohkawa and Fujisaku. The disguised form of the Elder Bairn from the fifth episode was based on train carriages from the Kamikōchi Line in Nagano Prefecture that Mizushima had enjoyed traveling on as a boy. The Elder Bairn from the ninth episode was intended for the second episode, but the staff felt it was too strong to appear so early, so it was shifted to a later episode. All the Elder Bairns were designed to give the impression of a [...] "vivid, flesh-and-blood texture".|$|E
2500|$|O.T.O. was {{described}} by Crowley as the [...] "first of the <b>great</b> <b>Old</b> Æon orders to accept The Book of the Law".

2500|$|In {{the late}} 17th – early 18th century, {{the most radical}} {{elements}} of the Raskol movement went into recession after it had become obvious that the reforms could not be reversed.

2500|$|Though Chet Atkins was {{the most}} {{prominent}} guitarist to be inspired by Merle Travis, the two players' styles were significantly different.

It was somewhat reminiscent of the <b>great</b> <b>old</b> black players." [...] The resemblance was no coincidence; Travis himself acknowledged the influence of black guitarists such as Blind Blake, the foremost ragtime and blues guitarist of the late 1920s and early 1930s.|$|E
