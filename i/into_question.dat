40|$|This paper explores whether {{national}} political questions {{during the second}} party system were resolved <b>into</b> <b>questions</b> adjudicated by the Supreme Court of the United States. The essay details an appropriate test for Tocqueville’s thesis, demonstrates that most {{national political}} questions that excited Jacksonians were not resolved <b>into</b> judicial <b>questions,</b> and explains why Tocqueville’s thesis does not accurately describe national constitutional politics during the three decades before the Civil War. That most political questions were not resolved <b>into</b> judicial <b>questions</b> during the three decades before the Civil War given common political science claim that “(v) irtually any issue the Court might wish to resolve is offered to it. ” That Jacksonian political actors did not resolve all political <b>questions</b> <b>into</b> constitutional <b>questions</b> or <b>into</b> constitutional <b>questions</b> adjudicated by the Supreme Court requires major rethinking {{of the role of}} law and political choice in structuring the Supreme Court’s agenda...|$|R

Participants' smoking-related risk perception was higher after exposure to warning labels formulated as questions or no warning labels than after exposure to textual or graphic warning labels. These results indicate that reformulating statements <b>into</b> <b>questions</b> can avoid defensive responses elicited by textual- and graphic warning labels...|$|R

40|$|The primary {{motivation}} for this dissertation is {{to further the}} study of CM lifting of abelian varieties based on work by Chai, Conrad, and Oort. One general area of inquiry is how much control we have over the ramification of the discrete valuation ring over which the given CM abelian variety has a CM-lift after an isogeny. Questions of this kind may be solvable by translating them <b>into</b> <b>questions</b> involving $p$-divisible groups, and then <b>into</b> <b>questions</b> involving Dieudonne modules. In order {{to make use of}} this transformation, we must first classify Dieudonne modules of CM p-divisible groups over finite fields up to isomorphism and isogeny. We begin that process in this dissertation, identifying invariants which determine the isomorphism and isogeny classes of such modules...|$|R
