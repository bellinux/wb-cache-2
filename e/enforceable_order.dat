40|$|Enforced {{execution}} is {{the legal}} way by which the Creditor under an <b>enforceable</b> <b>order</b> protects his rights by resorting to coercive force of the state. When the Debtor does not comply voluntarily, the Creditor may appeal to the Bailiff to commence the enforced execution in all manner prescribed by law. Of course, the start of compulsory execution {{is limited by the}} conditions of admissibility imperatively specified in the law, principally the condition to exist an <b>enforceable</b> <b>order</b> owned by the Creditor. Regarding the order to be enforced, it can be represented either by an enforceable or final judgement, with provisional enforcement or any other document that can be enforced. Procedurally, the provisions of Art. 712 of the Civil Procedure Code allow the introduction by a Creditor who has a litigation to execution against the execution itself, against the Closures issued by the Bailiff, and against any other act of enforcement. Jurisdiction of the Court in this matter will be of the Executor Court or the Court in whose district the Debtor is situated, on the date of the appeal. The appeal of the Debtor questions the Parties not only over the acts of execution because the appeal is also allowed over the explanations relative to the meaning, scope or application of the <b>enforceable</b> <b>order,</b> but in the conditions limited by the legal nature of this order. Thus, according to the law when <b>enforceable</b> <b>order</b> is not issued by a Court or Arbitration may be invoked before an Executor Court including reasons of fact or law which could not be discussed during an earlier trial, in the first instance or in an appeal. Basically, if enforced execution is under an <b>enforceable</b> <b>order</b> that is not from a Court, these reasons can be invoked when there is no other processual mean for its abolition. There also can be submitted a complaint against the Closure by which was upheld the appeal for an enforced execution, and the act of execution concerning the division of the common property or common goods. For the purposes of the foregoing ideas, the article details the mean of introduction the execution appeal for recovery of emoluments arising from a legal labour relationship. Creditor’s debt is represented by the financial rights related to the management function held in a public institution. Regarding the enforcement order it is the Decision of the Appeal Court by which the Debtor public institution is obliged to cover the material damage suffered by the Creditor civil servant, starting from the time of his dismissal from the management function until effectively reintegration on the same position. There are analysed the Debtor’s appeals requesting the annulment of execution acts issued by the Bailiff, and the execution itself, the appeal motivation, the defences of the parties in fact and in law, {{and the role of the}} Court during the course of the procedure...|$|E

2500|$|In modern practice, {{perhaps the}} most {{important}} distinction between law and equity is the set of remedies each offers. The most common civil remedy a court of law can award is monetary damages. Equity, however, enters injunctions or decrees directing someone either to act or to forbear from acting. Often, this form of relief is in practical terms more valuable to a litigant; for example, a plaintiff whose neighbor will not return his only milk cow, which had wandered onto the neighbor's property, may want that particular cow back, not just its monetary value. However, in general, a litigant cannot obtain equitable relief unless there is [...] "no adequate remedy at law"; that is, a court will not grant an injunction unless monetary damages are an insufficient remedy for the injury in question. Law courts can also enter certain types of immediately <b>enforceable</b> <b>orders,</b> called [...] "writs" [...] (such as a writ of habeas corpus), but they are less flexible and less easily obtained than an injunction.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{degradation}} of groundwater quality {{as a result}} of incessant pollution by petroleum hydrocarbon contaminants (PHCs) resulting from oil spillage has enhanced research activities on the subsurface environment. The purpose of the research is largely to acquire better understanding of this environment in order to adequately control these intruding contaminants. Hence, this paper presents an overview of the occurrence of the uncontrolled releases of PHCs and their resulting adverse effects, with particular focus on the Nigerian environment. Geochemistry of petroleum, basic geochemical characterization techniques of the contaminants, its detection, behavior, fate and transport within the subsurface environment are discussed. In addition, various restoration techniques for the recovery of contaminants with different physical and chemical properties in groundwater and soils are presented. The following are observed: that recovery of PHCs in soils and groundwater is complex, and needs to be approached on a site specific basis; that groundwater degradation is a direct consequence of economic and industrial development, hence there is need for a form of trade-offs between groundwater protection and infrastructural developments. Conclusively, there is need for areas delineated for groundwater recharge and discharge to be cost effectively protected from PHCs by <b>enforceable</b> laws in <b>order</b> to forestall further groundwater quality degradation...|$|R
40|$|Citizenship {{has always}} been a dynamic notion, subject to change and {{permanent}} struggle over its precise content and meaning. Recent technological, economic, and political transformations have {{led to the development of}} alternative notions of citizenship that go beyond the classic understanding of its relationship to nation states and rights. Civil society actors play an important role in this process by organizing themselves at a transnational level, engaging with issues that transcend the boundaries of the nation state and questioning the democratic legitimacy of other transnational actors such as international and corporate organizations. They also allow citizens to engage with "unbounded" issues and to construct a transnational public sphere where such issues can be debated. It is often assumed that the Internet plays a crucial role in enabling this transnational public sphere to take shape. Empirical analysis of discussion forums and mailing lists developed by transnational civil society actors shows, however, that the construction of such a transnational public sphere is paved with constraints. To speak of a unified transnational public sphere is therefore deemed to be problematic. It cannot be seen or construed without taking into account the local, the national, and <b>enforceable</b> rights in <b>order</b> to materialize the ideas and hopes being voiced through civil society...|$|R

As a result, 48 000 cattle were put at great risk of trypanosomiasis, and the mortality from the disease reached 300 head a monthThe aims of this project were to assist in emergency control measures to protect these cattle, and to formulate proposals for the adequate planning of land-use development. Trypanosomicidal drugs and veterinary equipment supplied by the project were used in the implementation by the Field Division of the Veterinary Services of an interim programme for disease controlThe disease reached epidemic proportions mainly owing to the reinfestation of the cleared areas with tsetse from across the international border. This clearly illustrated the need for regional cooperation to ensure the permanent success of sustained, large-scale programmes for disease control and vector eradication. The consultancy mission fielded by the project emphasized the need for tsetse reclamation schemes in marginal areas to be supported by land-use planning and controlled settlement.

40|$|In {{a policy}}-based system management, a policy {{refinement}} process {{is required to}} translate abstract policies, which are specified by human, into enforceable policies, which are enforced by machine. However, a manual policy refinement process imposes some problems. The first {{problem is that it}} requires expert knowledge to perform the policy refinement process. The second problem is that refining policies for complex systems is a tedious task. Manual refinement process may cause some negative consequences due to human errors, i. e., improper specification of <b>enforceable</b> policies. In <b>order</b> to solve the problems mentioned above, we envisage the automated policy refinement process by using refinement patterns. By adopting the pattern paradigm, we define the refinement patterns to capture the expert knowledge. Furthermore, we formalize these refinement patterns, the policies and the considered system. This approach enables the automation of the policy refinement process, which solves the second problem. We present these building blocks: (i) formal representations of the considered system and the policies, (ii) definition of a policy refinement tree, (iii) definition of policy refinement patterns in formal representation, (iv) combining computational tree logic-* and description logics formalisms to enable the automated pattern matching and (v) development of the algorithm for policy refinement and for generating the enforceable policies. In this thesis we consider the refinement of workflow policies as our scenario, since we want to specify access control policies. These access control policies are derived from workflow. These policies are usually specified in domain-specific terminologies, such as finance, engineering, military, etc. Thus, it underpins our approach to using semantic technology to formalize the policy refinement patterns. Although the work presented in this thesis deals with the refinement of workflow policies, one can adapt this approach to refine policies for various discrete systems. The contribution of this thesis is a concept to automate the policy refinement process by using security experts knowledge, which is stored as policy refinement patterns. To realize this concept, we combine two approaches, namely model checking and knowledge representation...|$|R
40|$|Whichever party wins government, {{procedures}} {{for dealing with}} disputes need to change, writes ANTHONY FORSYTH LABOR’S pledge to abolish the Australian Industrial Relations Commission (AIRC) along with several other federal agencies {{and replace them with}} a new body, Fair Work Australia, has generated significant debate and media attention. Much of this discussion has focused upon three aspects. First, the “surprise element” of Labor’s move, which involved turning its back on the AIRC after supporting the institution in the face of {{more than a decade of}} government attacks. Secondly, the rationale for this policy shift, most likely emanating from a desire to start again with new appointees given the perception that the government has “stacked” the tribunal with employer representatives. And thirdly, the constitutional validity of the proposal, with concern in some quarters about the combining of enforcement/prosecution functions and judicial/determination functions within the same body. But there has been very little discussion of the implications of Labor’s announcement for workplace dispute resolution. Before addressing that issue, what has been the experience with dispute resolution in the first year or so of Work Choices? Work Choices effected a fundamental shift from the century-long tradition of compulsory conciliation and arbitration of industrial disputes in the AIRC to a framework of voluntary dispute resolution. Parties to workplace disputes now have the option of having them resolved in the AIRC, or using private alternative dispute resolution (ADR) providers such as mediators and arbitrators. The AIRC’s dispute resolution powers are now very limited. It can no longer require parties to attend proceedings, nor can it exercise other powers that are conducive to effective dispute settlement (such as summonsing witnesses or ordering the production of documents). Proceedings are now conducted in private, with strict confidentiality obligations attaching to information disclosed in those proceedings. And given that the commission cannot make <b>enforceable</b> <b>orders,</b> it is unclear how any outcomes it forges can be enforced. If the parties wish to use a private ADR provider then the outcomes are subject to and enforceable under the general law of contract; where they involve arbitration, state commercial arbitration legislation might also apply. While dispute resolution in the AIRC is free of charge, the parties have to meet the costs of private ADR. But the government has established the Alternative Dispute Resolution Assistance Scheme, which enables parties to obtain up to $ 1500 for each eligible dispute, to partially offset the costs of utilising a private ADR provider. These new arrangements have not led employers, employees and unions to “flee” from the AIRC as a dispute resolution forum in favour of the new private ADR option. Federal Budget figures in May revealed that only $ 74, 000 was expended on the assistance scheme in its first year of operation, which equates to around 50 disputes. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that the take-up rate of private ADR has been very low, although the government does not currently make available information regarding the operation of the assistance scheme or private ADR. Employers, employees and unions still seem to prefer using the AIRC in matters where it has jurisdiction. Work Choices cut a huge swathe through the commission’s jurisdiction, however, primarily with its new exemptions on unfair dismissal claims and the removal of the AIRC’s minimum-wage setting and agreement approval functions. On the first anniversary of Work Choices at the end of March, the AIRC president, Justice Giudice, released figures showing that these changes have led to a dramatic reduction in the commission’s workload. Total dispute resolution matters notified to the AIRC fell from 2420 in the year March 2005 -March 2006 to 1344 in the year to March 2007. The commission’s overall workload (measured by total lodgement numbers) was cut by two thirds in the same period, from 29, 246 to 10, 138. These figures paint a starkly illuminating picture of the extent to which the AIRC - the once impregnable institution at the apex of Australia’s industrial relations system - has been marginalised by Work Choices. Coming back, then, to Labor’s proposal to establish Fair Work Australia. Dispute resolution has been designated as one of the many functions that the new organisation would perform, and Labor leader Kevin Rudd has also indicated that Labor would retain the current voluntary dispute settlement framework. But this still leaves many questions unanswered. For example, would the parties still have the option of private ADR, or would all disputes be channelled through Fair Work Australia? In my view, Labor should abolish the private ADR stream and the Alternative Dispute Resolution Assistance Scheme, which are being largely ignored in practice. Instead, all workplace dispute resolution should be brought within the realm of the public agency, Fair Work Australia, and should be fully publicly funded. Within that framework, parties could continue to be given a range of options for having disputes resolved. For example, as well as traditional forms of dispute settlement such as conciliation, mediation and arbitration, newer methods such as conferencing, case appraisal and assisted negotiation could continue to be made available. The parties could choose the form of dispute resolution they want for their particular dispute, and which member of Fair Work Australia they want to assist them. However, parties should be required to have some form of ADR before a matter could be heard and finally determined by Fair Work Australia (as is the case in the Victorian equal opportunity jurisdiction, and is now common practice in many courts). Further, the new oreganisation must have strong powers to ensure effective dispute resolution for a wide range of employment grievances and workplace relations disputes. It must also have the powers necessary to command the authority and respect of the parties. Finally, what are the prospects for dispute resolution if the federal government is re-elected? Clearly, Labor’s new policy position makes it very easy for the government to do what it has probably wanted to do for some time - abolish the AIRC. But what dispute resolution arrangements would the government put in its place? Conceivably, the government might opt for a system based entirely on private ADR. But the experience under Work Choices suggests that this would not meet the needs of the parties. Whatever the outcome of this year’s election, there must be some form of public dispute resolution body in place to ensure that employers, employees and unions are able to access efficient, practical and cost-effective dispute resolution services. • Anthony Forsyth is a senior lecturer in the Department of Business Law at Monash University, and an Advisory Board Member of the Australian Institute of Employment Rights.
