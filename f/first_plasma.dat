25|$|Stellarator: Twisted {{rings of}} hot plasma. The {{stellarator}} attempts {{to create a}} natural twist plasma path, using external magnets, while tokamaks create those magnetic fields using an internal current. Stellarators were developed by Lyman Spitzer in 1950 and have four designs: Torsatron, Heliotron, Heliac and Helias. One example is Wendelstein 7-X, a German fusion device that produced its <b>first</b> <b>plasma</b> on December 10, 2015. It is the world's largest stellarator, designed to investigate the suitability {{of this type of}} device for a power station.|$|E
25|$|He {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} electron temperature and in 1924 invented the diagnostic method for measuring both temperature and density with an electrostatic probe, now called a Langmuir probe and commonly used in plasma physics. The current of a biased probe tip is measured {{as a function of}} bias voltage to determine the local plasma temperature and density. He also discovered atomic hydrogen, which he put to use by inventing the atomic hydrogen welding process; the <b>first</b> <b>plasma</b> weld ever made. Plasma welding has since been developed into gas tungsten arc welding.|$|E
2500|$|The {{small size}} of the {{negative}} glow region of a neon lamp, and the flexible electronic properties that were exploited in electronic circuits, led {{to the adoption of}} this technology for the earliest plasma panel displays. The first monochrome dot matrix plasma panel displays were developed in 1964 at the University of Illinois for the PLATO educational computing system. They had the characteristic color of the neon lamp; their inventors, Donald L. Bitzer, H. Gene Slottow, and Robert H. Wilson, had achieved a working computer display that remembered its own state, and did not require constant refreshing from the central computer system. The relationship between these early monochrome displays and contemporary, color plasma displays and televisions was described by Larry F. Weber in 2006, [...] "All plasma TVs on the market today have the same features that were demonstrated in the <b>first</b> <b>plasma</b> display which was a device with only a single cell. These features include alternating sustain voltage, dielectric layer, wall charge, and a neon-based gas mixture." [...] As in colored neon lamps, plasma displays use a gas mixture that emits ultraviolet light. Each pixel has a phosphor that emits one of the display's base colors.|$|E

This thesis details the engineering design and <b>first</b> <b>plasmas</b> of the Mochi. Labjet experiment. The experiment required {{construction of a new}} three electrode plasma gun with azimuthal symmetric gas injection, two optically-isolated pulsed power supplies for generating and sustaining plasma, and one optically-isolated pulsed power supply for generating a background magnetic field.
