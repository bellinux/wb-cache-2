40|$|There {{are many}} {{technological}} challenges {{related to the}} production of electrical power from offshore wind farms. Norwegian companies are working on different aspects of offshore wind power generation and the Norwegian Research Council has in this context supported a five year project called: ?High Voltage AC and DC Subsea Cables for Offshore Wind Farms and Transmission Grids?. This master thesis {{has been a part of}} that project. Power electronics used for HVDC converters will stress the cable with a HVDC component with overlaid transients. The effect of the DC component and the overlaid transients on the performance of the polymeric cable insulation is not yet known and the main purpose of this master thesis has been to investigate how transients can influence water tree growth within wet XLPE insulation. The effect of the DC component has also been evaluated. Laboratory experiments were conducted on Rogowski shaped test objects with an insulation thickness of 1. 1 mm. 20 sodium chloride particles were added on the lower semiconductor during the manufacturing process. This was done to facilitate the initiation of water trees. The finished test objects were preconditioned with demineralized water in a <b>heating</b> <b>cabinet</b> at 30 &# 176;C for four weeks to ensure that the insulation was saturated with water. An experimental setup capable of applying a DC voltage with a superimposed high frequency AC component was used to simulate the HVDC component and the overlaid transients that occur close to the power electronics used for AC to DC conversion. Two sets of experiments were conducted. The first set was conducted using a 15 kHz AC component, with resulting electrical field strength of &# 177; 2. 05 kV/mm. The second set of experiments was conducted combining the same high frequency AC component with a superimposed DC voltage, resulting in an electrical field strength of 12 &# 177; 2. 05 kV/mm. Nine Rogowski shaped test objects were aged in both sets of experiments. Three test objects were aged for one week, another three for two weeks, while the last three test objects were aged for three complete weeks. The test objects were kept in a <b>heating</b> <b>cabinet</b> at 30 &# 176;C during testing, and with the exception of the electrical field, treated identically during both sets of experiments. All test objects experienced water tree initiation and growth. The length of the longest water tree and the aggregated water tree density were observed to increase as a function of ageing time for both sets of experiments. All water trees were oblong and grew in the direction of the electrical field. The longest observed water tree, after three weeks of ageing exposed to an AC component only, was 607 &# 181;m, corresponding to 55 % of the total insulation thickness. Two out of three test objects, exposed to a DC voltage with a superimposed AC component, suffered breakdown before enduring three complete weeks of ageing. This was most likely the result of a water tree bridging the 1100 &# 181;m thick insulation. Test objects exposed to a DC voltage with a superimposed high frequency AC component were also observed to experience a higher aggregated water tree density, with vented water trees observed at the lower semiconductor constituting the main difference. As a result, it could be argued that the DC voltage, when combined with a superimposed high frequency AC component, increases water tree initiation and growth within wet XLPE insulation. The experiments also indicate that HVDC cables should be made water tight to prevent water tree degradation due to the transients originating from the switching of the power electronic converters. </p...|$|E
40|$|Concrete and {{lightweight}} concrete {{elements are}} today used in various building applications {{to a great}} extent all over the world. Replacing traditional thermal insulation like e. g. expanded polystyrene (EPS), extruded polystyrene (XPS) and polyurethane (PUR) by vacuum insulation panels (VIPs) is discussed in order to increase the thermal resistance without increasing the wall thickness. Compared to traditional concrete and lightweight concrete elements, slimmer elements may still achieve U-values low enough to fulfil passive house or zero energy requirements. Thus, sandwich elements with VIPs may be an alternative to the traditional solutions. However, there may be some problems related to the use of VIPs in such concrete elements. The alkaline environment in concrete may lead to reactions with the aluminium (Al) in the multi-layered laminate used as the VIP envelope, and destroy its barrier function. To investigate the influence of the alkaline environment on the durability of VIPs in general, and the VIP envelope in particular, various VIP and VIP envelope specimen experiments have been carried out. The VIPs were subjected to different alkaline solutions at different temperatures, with and without direct contact with the liquid alkaline solutions. A worst-case scenario was investigated when any additional protection of the VIPs was disregarded. The results from the VIP experiments showed various degrees of degradation effects. Depending on the temperature and the pH-value of the alkaline environment the VIPs were exposed to, physical and thermal changes were observed on some of the test specimens, while others were more or less unaffected by the exposure. In general, the temperature proved to be the hardest strain, when the VIPs in <b>heating</b> <b>cabinet</b> showed much greater signs of degradation than the VIPs at room temperature, more or less independent on the pH-value of the alkaline solution they were exposed to. Interesting results were also obtained from the VIP envelope specimen experiment, where the VIP envelope showed signs of degradation after only a short time in alkaline solution. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{electrical}} properties of a widely used stress control tube for medium voltage heat-shrink joints are {{examined in this}} master thesis by using non-destructive laboratory methods. They were determined by use of time domain dielectric response test while changing the DC electric field, temperature and level of humidity. In {{order to determine the}} physical and mechanical characteristics of the material at different aging stages and conditions, both differential scanning calorimetry and tensile test measurements were performed on stress control tube samples. Two types of test samples were prepared. For dielectric response tests, Raychem JSCR 42 / 16 stress control tube was shrunk on a cylindrical rod, consisting of two metal electrodes, separated by a PTFE (Teflon) insulating rod. For differential scanning calorimetry and tensile tests, the stress control tube was shrunk on a cylindrical PTFE rod only, with the same diameter as for the dielectric response tests without the presence of metal electrodes. Tensile test measurements were performed in order to characterize and compare the mechanical properties of the stress control tube material at different aging stages. Differential scanning calorimetry measurements were used to estimate aging degree by assessment of thermal resistivity of the material and antioxidants consumption when exposed to high temperatures for a certain period of time. To calculate the conductivity, dielectric response measurements were performed in time domain at different voltage levels up to 20 kV and charging and discharging time duration of 10800 s. They were conducted by placing the test object in a climate chamber in order to examine the influence of temperature and humidity. The measurements were performed on unaged and thermally aged heat shrinkable stress control tubes. The aging process was obtained in <b>heat</b> <b>cabinets</b> at 98 °C dry air, 98 °C wet air and 150 °C dry air conditions.

The system, called Kitchen Minder, monitors time and temperature in the cabinets and notifies staff and managers when to prepare more food and discard older products. Initially developed from 1998 to 2000, the system is designed to work with a holding cabinet system that was developed by Duke. The initial test designs were time-consuming to program because each bay in the holding units had to be programmed manually. This meant several minutes were required for each product, which added up to several hours to program up to six units with eight bays each. When BK finally deployed the system in 2001, the updated units utilized a Palm Pilot to configure the units using a custom program designed to easily configure the units via Infrared or serial port. A kitchen flow software system that helps centralize information about the system was deployed in 2007; combined with the new equipment, it helped further reduce costs for the company and its franchises by calculating projected sales and actual usage. Along with the holding system, Burger King deployed newer high-speed toasters to decrease make times; the new toasters, while faster, require more maintenance, which increases overall labor costs.|$|R

5000|$|The direct {{exchange}} {{geothermal heat}} pump (DX) {{is the oldest}} type of geothermal heat pump technology. The ground-coupling is achieved through a single loop, circulating refrigerant, in direct thermal contact with the ground (as opposed {{to a combination of}} a refrigerant loop and a water loop). The refrigerant leaves the <b>heat</b> pump <b>cabinet,</b> circulates through a loop of copper tube buried underground, and exchanges heat with the ground before returning to the pump. The name [...] "direct exchange" [...] refers to heat transfer between the refrigerant loop and the ground without the use of an intermediate fluid. There is no direct interaction between the fluid and the earth; only heat transfer through the pipe wall. Direct exchange heat pumps are {{not to be confused with}} [...] "water-source heat pumps" [...] or [...] "water loop heat pumps" [...] since there is no water in the ground loop. ASHRAE defines the term ground-coupled heat pump to encompass closed loop and direct exchange systems, while excluding open loops.Direct exchange systems are more efficient and have potentially lower installation costs than closed loop water systems. Copper's high thermal conductivity contributes to the higher efficiency of the system, but heat flow is predominantly limited by the thermal conductivity of the ground, not the pipe. The main reasons for the higher efficiency are the elimination of the water pump (which uses electricity), the elimination of the water-to-refrigerant heat exchanger (which is a source of heat losses), and most importantly, the latent heat phase change of the refrigerant in the ground itself.|$|R

Production of XYZ showed constant production in the last 5 years, while number of demand increased implicitly due to several factors. So the company needs alternative to increase the production. For solicit alternatives, this study used OEE (Overall Equipment Effectiveness) method for analysis the production process. OEE is used in order to produce a comprehensive understanding of the process because it considers availability, performance, and quality aspects at once. The result of observation, OEE of heated drying machine is 78, 76 % and folding machine is 83, 76 %, lower than OEE World Class (85 %). That result makes this study focus to the both of machines. Alternative to improve the heated drying machine’s OEE is preventive action to prevent element wires of heater breaking, replace the blower when damage occurred, and specify the optimal temperature and time for drying process. While the alternative to improve the folding machine’s OEE is change the layout process and replace the person in charge of machine’s damage. Analysis of the yield improvement can increase production and profits PT BCD. Alternative to improve yield, include: facilitate the lifting of amylum while weighting process; improve the cleaning procedure on the process granulation, sieving, and drying; and reduce the suction power of vacum cleaner during tableting process. Directors need to assess the future strategy and sales forecast from marketing. If the implementation of OEE and improvement of yield are still not sufficient, it is necessary to choose other alternatives below gradually depending on the value of the desired output. Alternative to increased production from drying process is add employees work shift and a non heated drying cabinet; add a non <b>heated</b> drying <b>cabinet</b> and a <b>heated</b> drying cabinet; use Fluidized Bed Dryer (FBD). Alternative to the other process is add employess work shift or make employees overtime in tableting, stripping, folding catch cover, and sealing process or in the process of mounting the strip to catch cover...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the construction of}} a climate-cabinet for testing of HV-cards (High Voltage) produced at VG Scienta. The main part of the report describes all the different components of the cabinet. The most important parts are a PID regulator from Eurotherm model 2408, a solid state contactor (SSC), a thermocouple, a finned resistor from DBK and different fans. The report even includes the connection between components by cable wiring, isolation, grounding, fuses and shaping of metal goods. As the cabinet also communicates with a computer, the report includes the solution of the data communication using the software iTools from Eurotherm. The communication part includes information about a converter that converts EIA 422 to USB. The cabinet was produced at a company, called VG Scienta, in Uppsala during the spring 2010. The construction of an additional climate-cabinet was necessary because during the last year Scientas productivity increased, and it was important for the company to be able to manage the testing of an increased number of electronics. Which solution is best for the <b>heating</b> of a <b>cabinet?</b> How does the communication work between a PC and a Eurotherm 2408 regulator? How to detect the temperature inside of the cabinet? These are some of the topics which are discussed. The finished cabinet resembled the old cabinet in many ways. The difference between them is that the later one allows the testing of twice as many HV-cards, in an even more flexible way by the communication between the regulator and the computer. It means that the regulator parameters can be set continually and by programming it is possible to save the settings, the parameters and the curves...|$|R
40|$|As part of {{the effort}} to improve {{residential}} energy efficiency and reduce greenhouse emissions from power plants, several design options were investigated for improving the energy efficiency of a conventionally designed domestic refrigerator-freezer. The program goal was to reduce the energy consumption of a 20 -ft{sup 3 } (570 -L) top-mount refrigerator-freeze to 1. 00 kWh/d, a 50 % reduction from the 1993 National Appliance Energy Conservation Act (NAECA) standard. The options [...] such as improved cabinet and door insulation, a high-efficiency compressor, a low-wattage fan, a large counterflow evaporator, and adaptive defrost control [...] were incorporated into prototype refrigerator-freezer cabinets and refrigeration systems. The refrigerant HFC- 134 a was used as a replacement for CFC- 12. The baseline energy performance of the production refrigerator-freezers, along with <b>cabinet</b> <b>heat</b> load and compressor calorimeter test results, were extensively documented to provide a firm basis for experimentally measured energy savings. The project consisted of three main phases: (1) an evaluation of energy-efficient design options using computer simulation models and experimental testing, (2) design and testing of an initial prototype unit, and (3) energy and economic analyses of a final prototype. The final prototype achieved an energy consumption level of 0. 93 kWh/d [...] an improvement of 45 % over the baseline unit and 54 % over the 1993 NAECA standard for 20 -fg{sup 3 } (570 -L) units. The manufacturer`s cost for those improvements was estimated at $ 134; assuming that cost is doubled for the consumer, it would take about 11. 4 years to pay for the design changes. Since the payback period was thought to be unfeasible, a second, more cost-effective design was also tested. Its energy consumption level was 1. 16 kWh/d, a 42 % energy savings, at a manufacturer`s cost increase of $ 53. Again assuming a 100 % markup, the payback for this unit would be 6. 6 years...|$|R
40|$|The retail of food {{produces}} {{a large amount}} of carbon, both directly through embodied energy in the food and its packaging, and indirectly through energy use. Supermarkets are large consumers of energy in the UK, accounting for up to 5 % of the UK’s total consumption. A large proportion of this energy, up to 50 %, is used in refrigeration of food and much of this is used to cool open type display cabinets. However, work at Unilever Research Laboratory in the 1970 s indicated that the input energy required for cooling open display refrigerated cabinets could be substantially reduced by applying low emissivity (i. e. high reflectance) materials in food packaging, causing the <b>cabinet</b> <b>heat</b> load and the temperatures of stored foods to be reduced. One drawback was that it was difficult to print on the surface of these materials without reducing their reflective properties. However, subsequent developments in packaging technology and the use of modern manufacturing processes have overcome the earlier disadvantages of these materials, permitting printing onto the external surfaces of low emissivity packaging, while still retaining its reflective properties. This paper presents an update of the Unilever study, in terms of the potential of modern, low emissivity food packaging materials for improving refrigeration system efficiency. The results of the new study indicate that some types of packaging will allow an increase in refrigerator operating temperature of up to 10 K, with no loss of refrigeration performance with respect to the food. This is expected to result in improved refrigeration system efficiency, with reductions of up to 30 % in both energy consumption and carbon emissions and a likely significant increase in shelf life for stored foods. In addition, the embodied carbon for the packaging and the life cycle impact of its use, have been evaluated. Packaging having low embodied energy content has been identified, and it has been predicted that significant net savings in both carbon and energy are possible over the life cycle...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to study {{possible}} pathways {{that lead to the}} development of brown kernel and postharvest rancidity. Inferior kernel quality results in nut rejection and hence leads to economic loss. Postharvest steps are inter-related to each other, therefore this project has attempted to cover as many aspects as possible to give a full understanding of how postharvest treatments affect macadamia quality. The study was conducted on five macadamia varieties including A 38, 246, 816, 842 and Daddow. The study shows that brown kernel can occur through three different pathways including enzymic browning reaction, Maillard reaction and microorganisms infection. To study the enzymic browning reaction, phenolic compounds and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) activities were analysed. The most common phenolic compounds present in macadamia are gallic acid and chlorogenic acid. Brown section had higher level of bound phenolics compared to the white section of the same kernel. This indicated the likely involvement of phenolic compounds in the formation of brown kernel. The possibility of Maillard reaction involvement was studied by determination of reducing sucrose substrate level by HPLC. Sucrose was hydrolysed into reducing sugars when nuts were subjected to drying using either <b>heat</b> pump or <b>cabinet</b> dryers. Reducing sugars then reacted with kernel protein causing brown pigment via the Maillard reaction. The Daddow variety showed the least hydrolysis degree compared to other varieties. Browning could also be a result of microorganisms infection as infected kernels turned into brown. As the kernel is a biological sample, when it was infected with moulds, it could utilise phenols which act as an anti-pathogenic compound. Analysis of the microstructure of kernels by confocal microscopy showed the distribution of possible brown pigment compounds such as lipid, carbohydrate, protein. Some other novel techniques such as X-ray tomography and magnetic resonance diffusion tensor imaging used in this project provide {{a better understanding of the}} microstructure. The findings of this study have potential to improve the existing postharvest techniques used in the macadamia processing industry...|$|R
