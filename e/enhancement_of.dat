40|$|Objectives: The aim was {{to study}} the {{patterns}} of solitary thyroid nodule with real-time contrast-enhanced ultrasound (CEUS) and assess its value in differentiating between malignant and benign thyroid nodules. Materials and Methods: Seventy-eight patients with solitary thyroid nodule (37 malignant, 41 benign) underwent real-time CEUS. The patterns <b>of</b> their <b>enhancement</b> were assessed from six aspects: Degree <b>of</b> <b>enhancement,</b> process <b>of</b> <b>enhancement,</b> homogeneity <b>of</b> <b>enhancement,</b> completeness <b>of</b> <b>enhancement,</b> boundary <b>of</b> the enhanced lesions, {{and shape of the}} enhanced lesions. Results: Contrast-enhanced patterns were significantly different between benign and malignant thyroid nodules (P < 0. 05), except for process <b>of</b> <b>enhancement.</b> The shape <b>of</b> most malignant lesions was irregular (94. 59 %), the boundary was unclear (86. 49 %) and had no significantly enhanced (78. 38 %). Most malignant lesions became inhomogeneously (78. 38 %) and incompletely enhanced (70. 27 %). Conclusions: The patterns of real-time CEUS are significantly different between benign and malignant thyroid nodules, and have important clinical value...|$|R
