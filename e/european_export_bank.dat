The policy part of the paper {{is focused on the}} interac- tion of government owned and supported Czech <b>Export</b> <b>Bank</b> with the Czech commercial banks. We argue that the major market share of Czech <b>Export</b> <b>Bank</b> in <b>export</b> credit market may be explained by a number of factors in addition to the competitive advantage provided by lower pro�t margins of Czech <b>Export</b> <b>Bank.</b> These factors may be grouped into strategic factors related to competition among commercial banks and into factors based on Czech <b>Export</b> <b>Bank</b> being state owned specialized <b>export</b> <b>bank</b> as opposed to private general banks. ...|$|R

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the export credit {{promotion}} in the Czech Republic. The econometric analysis of the gravity model of Czech trade shows that the credit support provided by specialized government agency, Czech <b>Export</b> <b>Bank,</b> has a positive but statistically weak influence on export. The other determinants of the Czech export in our model are GDP, distance, gross fixed capital formation, and policy risk. The comparison of estimated tax revenues from the supported projects with government subsidies provided to the Czech <b>Export</b> <b>Bank</b> shows that <b>export</b> promotion does not create a financial burden for the government budget. The budgetary costs of export credit support are offset by the tax revenues generated by supported export. Government Support, export, credit...|$|R
