5|$|The {{conclusion}} of the novella, in which Candide finally dismisses his tutor's optimism, leaves unresolved what philosophy the protagonist is to accept in its stead. This element of Candide <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> voluminously, perhaps above all others. The conclusion is enigmatic and its analysis is contentious.|$|E
5|$|After the shootout in Tombstone, {{his pursuit}} {{and murder of}} those who {{attacked}} his brothers, and after leaving Arizona, Wyatt was often the target of negative newspaper stories that disparaged his and his brothers' reputation. His role in history has stimulated considerable ongoing scholarly and editorial debate. A large body of literature <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> Wyatt Earp and his legacy, some of it highly fictionalized. Considerable portions of it are either full of admiration and flattery or hostile debunking.|$|E

5|$|Females perform all {{tasks of}} feeding and raising offspring, and have {{occasionally}} been observed caring for orphaned pups. Much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> {{the level of}} devotion of sea otter mothers for their pups– a mother gives her infant almost constant attention, cradling it on her chest away from the cold water and attentively grooming its fur. When foraging, she leaves her pup floating on the water, sometimes wrapped in kelp {{to keep it from}} floating away; if the pup is not sleeping, it cries loudly until she returns. Mothers have been known to carry their pups for days after the pups' deaths.|$|E
5|$|Details of Evans’ {{early life}} are unknown, {{apart from his}} birth date. No book <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> him, {{although}} he wrote his memoirs, Living The Beatles' Legend, from which extracts were released on 20 March 2005. What is known about him starts in 1961, when Evans married a Liverpool girl, Lily, after meeting her at a funfair in New Brighton opposite Liverpool on the Wirral. Their first child, Gary, {{was born in the}} same year. The Beatles were the resident group at Liverpool's Cavern Club when Evans first heard them perform during his lunch break. He was then living in Hillside Road, Mossley Hill and working as a telephone engineer for the Post Office. He became a committed fan, even though his musical hero at the time was Elvis Presley.|$|E
5|$|Monroe's {{enduring}} {{popularity is}} linked to her conflicted public image. On the one hand, she remains a sex symbol, beauty icon {{and one of the}} most famous stars of classical Hollywood cinema. On the other, she is also remembered for her troubled private life, unstable childhood, struggle for professional respect, and her death and the conspiracy theories surrounding it. She <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> by scholars and journalists interested in gender and feminism, such as Gloria Steinem, Jacqueline Rose, Molly Haskell, Sarah Churchwell, and Lois Banner. Some, such as Steinem, have viewed her as a victim of the studio system. Others, such as Haskell, Rose, and Churchwell, have instead stressed Monroe's proactive role in her career and her participation in the creation of her public persona.|$|E

25|$|The major {{ecosystems}} include mangrove and {{freshwater swamps}} and marshes, sedge prairie, pine savanna, and gallery forest. There is a diverse amount of flora, estimated at over 2,000 species of vascular plants, although little <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> it because many species are new or undiscovered.|$|E

25|$|It is {{possible}} that the shirt could be opened either at the back or down one side so that it was easier to put on, the opening being closed by ties. Much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> scale armour’s supposed vulnerability to an upward thrust, but this is probably exaggerated.|$|E
25|$|Much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> the {{degradation}} and depletion of natural fish stocks in rivers, estuaries, and the oceans (see also Overfishing). Because industrial fishing has become extremely efficient, ocean stocks of large fish, such as tuna, cod, and halibut have declined by 90% {{in the past}} 50 years.|$|E
25|$|The {{massacre}} also sparked many {{conversations in}} Japanese blogs {{when it was}} discovered that two Ustream users had broadcast live video streams of the tragedy, attracting a viewership estimated at between 1000 and 3000 people.

25|$|Much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> the siege, {{gathered}} {{from people who}} were there, people who were not, and taken from historical Marine documents. Con Thien was the battle before Tet, a battle commanders at the time dismissed, and later forgotten maybe a little embarrassed because it showed how unprepared the US was for the 1968 Tet offensive.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the story}} still cannot be {{published}} in England, Wales and Northern Ireland, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> extensively in the Republic of Ireland and Italy and on some Internet websites.

25|$|The {{legend of}} Billy the Kid has {{acquired}} iconic status in American folklore, yet the outlaw himself, {{also known as}} William Bonney, had minimal impact on historical events in New Mexico Territory of the late 1800s. More <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> Billy the Kid than any other gunslinger {{in the history of}} the American West, while hundreds of books, motion pictures, radio and television programs and even a ballet have been inspired by his legend.|$|E

25|$|Next Thamyras sings. He {{invokes the}} Muses, and sings that {{the riches of}} Helicon and an Apollo are here. He also invokes Troy, and sings that its fall was all worth it. The meaning is unclear, but it is usually {{interpreted}} to mean that a new poem <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> Troy (possibly by Caesar himself). Thamyras sings of how Homer crowns Caesar with his own crown and Mantua tears up its writings.|$|E
25|$|Paul Schullery in American Fly Fishing – A History (1996) and The Rise (2006) {{explains}} that although much <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> imitation theories of fly design, all successful fly patterns must imitate something {{to attract the}} fish to strike. The huge range of fly patterns documented today {{for all sorts of}} target species—trout, salmon, bass and panfish, pike, saltwater, tropical exotics, etc.—are not easily categorized as merely imitative, attractors, searching or impressionistic.|$|E
25|$|Muffled drums {{are often}} {{associated}} with funeral ceremonies as well, such as the funerals of John F. Kennedy and Queen Victoria. The use of muffled drums <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>written</b> <b>about</b> by such poets as Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, John Mayne, and Theodore O'Hara. Drums have also been used for therapy and learning purposes, such as when an experienced player will sit {{with a number of}} students {{and by the end of}} the session have all of them relaxed and playing complex rhythms.|$|E
