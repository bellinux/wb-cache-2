They quote Alan Turing's answer to all arguments similar to Dreyfus':"we cannot so easily convince ourselves of the absence of complete laws of behaviour ... The only way we know of for finding such laws is scientific observation, and we certainly know of no circumstances under which we could say, 'We have searched enough. There are no such laws.'"Dreyfus did not anticipate that AI researchers would realize their mistake and begin to work towards new solutions, moving away from the symbolic methods that Dreyfus criticized. In 1965, he did not imagine that such programs would one day be created, so he claimed AI was impossible. In 1965, AI researchers did not imagine that such programs were necessary, so they claimed AI was almost complete. Both were wrong.|$|R

But as {{there are a number}} of search engines available, there must be some procedure to evaluate them. In this paper, architecture of a comprehensive web search evaluation system is discussed. We use a number of objective evaluation techniques to supplement the subjective evaluation based on user feedback. The user feedback is obtained implicitly by watching the actions of user on search results in response to his query. These techniques are combined using Modified Shimura technique of Rank aggregation. The aggregated ranking is then compared with the original ranking given by the search engine. The correlation coefficient thus obtained is averaged for a set of queries. We show our experimental results pertaining to seven public search engines and fifteen queries...|$|R
