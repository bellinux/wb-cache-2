5|$|Nitrous oxide (N2O), {{better known}} as {{laughing}} gas, is made by thermal decomposition of molten ammonium nitrate at 250°C. This is a redox reaction and thus nitric oxide and nitrogen are also produced as byproducts. It is mostly used as a propellant and aerating agent for sprayed canned whipped cream, and was formerly commonly used as an anaesthetic. Despite appearances, it cannot {{be considered to be}} the anhydride of <b>hyponitrous</b> <b>acid</b> (H2N2O2) because that acid is not produced by the dissolution of nitrous oxide in water. It is rather unreactive (not reacting with the halogens, the alkali metals, or ozone at room temperature, although reactivity increases upon heating) and has the unsymmetrical structure N–N–O (N≡N+O−↔−N=N+=O): above 600°C it dissociates by breaking the weaker N–O bond.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} of nitric oxide reduction in a ba 3 -type heme-copper oxidase {{has been investigated}} using density functional theory (B 3 LYP). Four possible mechanisms have been studied and free energy surfaces for {{the whole catalytic cycle}} including proton and electron transfers have been constructed by comparison to experimental data. The first nitric oxide coordinates to heme a 3 and is partly reduced having some nitroxyl anion character (3 NO−), and it is thus activated toward the attack by the second NO. In this reaction step a cyclic <b>hyponitrous</b> <b>acid</b> anhydride intermediate with the two oxygens coordinating to CuB is formed. The cyclic <b>hyponitrous</b> <b>acid</b> anhydride is quite stable in a local minimum with high barriers for both the backward and forward reactions and should thus be observable experimentally. To break the NO bond and form nitrous oxide, the <b>hyponitrous</b> <b>acid</b> anhydride must be protonated, the latter appearing to be an endergonic process. The endergonicity of the proton transfer makes the barrier of breaking the NO bond directly after the protonation too high. It is suggested that an electron should enter the catalytic cycle at this stage in order to break the NO bond and form N 2 O at a feasible rate. The cleavage of the NO bond is the rate limiting step in the reaction mechanism and it has a barrier of 17. 3 kcal/mol, close to the experimental value of 19. 5 kcal/mol. The overall exergonicity is fitted to experimental data and is 45. 6 kcal/mol...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} thesis the density {{functional}} B 3 LYP {{has been used}} to study reactions of NO and O 2 in redox active enzymes. Reduction of nitric oxide (NO) to nitrous oxide (N 2 O) is an important part in the bacterial energy conservation (denitrification). The reduction of NO in three different bimetallic active sites leads to the formation of <b>hyponitrous</b> <b>acid</b> anhydride (N 2 O 22 -). The stability of this intermediate is crucial for the reaction rate. In the two diiron systems, respiratory and scavenging types of NOR, it is possible to cleave the N-O bond, forming N 2 O, without any extra protons or electrons. In a heme-copper oxidase, on the other hand, both a proton and an electron are needed to form N 2 O. In addition to being an intermediate in the denitrification, NO is a toxic agent. Myoglobin in the oxy-form reacts with NO forming nitrate (NO 3 -) at a high rate, which should make this enzyme an efficient NO scavenger. Peroxynitrite (ONOO-) is formed as a short-lived intermediate and isomerizes to nitrate through a radical reaction. In the mechanism for pumping protons in cytochrome oxidase, thermodynamics, rather than structural changes, might guide protons to the heme propionate for further translocation. The dioxygenation of arachidonic acid in prostaglandin endoperoxide H synthase forms the bicyclic prostaglandin G 2, through a cascade of radical reactions. The mechanism proposed by Hamberg and Samuelsson is energetically feasible...|$|E
