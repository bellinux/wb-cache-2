40|$|The {{economical}} crisis Romania {{starts to}} cross is mainly an internal crisis {{determined by the}} wrong mix of macro-economical policies established in the last years. Economic growth proves to be unhealthy; that is because {{we have had a}} growth based on consumption financed on debt during these years. Private consumption was excessive, but the population should not be blamed: all the macro-economical measures have been pro-cyclic, stimulating consumption; and the most damaging of the all, the unique rate, is still protected by its initiators who do not want to admit they were wrong. The unique rate has stimulated the consumption and we have nowadays the first crisis of overconsumption in Romania. The main cause is the excessive consumption on debt. The population cannot be blamed, but in the future it can be better informed and surely more precautious regarding the expectations for the own incomes. In exchange, the government may be criticized because it made a monumental strategic mistake: in a time of <b>economical</b> <b>increase,</b> it consumed all this increase and it indebted itself additionally. The budgetary deficit increased from 1, 3 % of PIB in 2008 to 2, 6 % last year and probably over 3 % this year.

Internal economy: The service sector has the biggest weight of 67. 7 % in PIB frame followed by the industrial one with a share of 25. 8 %. The agriculture represents only 6. 5 % of PIB. The manpower owned by Brazil is around 95 million (from a total population of about 195 million inhabitants) shared as follows: 20 % in agriculture, 14 % in industry and 66 % in service sector. Due to the scientific and technological development of Brazil, this country is very attractive for the foreign investors, the average being somewhere around 2 - billion $ comparing to the average value of 2 billion $ according to the years 1990 – 2000. External economy: Lula administration used the solid increase of the global demand in the last years in order to decrease the external duty, to smooth the profile of the date of payment of the debt and to improve the interest dynamics and the currency. The massive capital influxes have led to the increase of the currency reserves at 245. 8 billion $ (the equivalent of the importers’ value for more than a year). However, the current account deficit will reach about 3. 5 % of PIB, and even if the foreign direct investments could not cover this deficit, we do not see any problems at horizon in its financing. Fiscal sector: even if the government has managed to maintain most of the macro-economical indicators in positive values, the lack of certain tools of limiting the public expenditures was translated by a continuous increase and a damage of the report between the public debt and PIB across the last years. Actually, the gross public debt (63 % of PIB in 2009) stays at a relatively big level comparing to other countries whose credit ranking is at least equal to BBB-. In addition, at a level of 10 % of PIB, the financing needs of the budgetary sector (governmental deficit and damping) are relatively big with the other states in the region; however, the very solid intern market will certainly be able to carry this fiscal charge.

40|$|I {{chose this}} topic because {{my goal was}} to capture in detail all aspects of the {{evolution}} of investment funds under the influence of factors leading to globalization of the banking financial market. Main motivation was that I proposed to present in an original manner the concept of investment in mutual funds by the thoroughness of the following points: the different types of investment funds from Romania, the advantages, the risks and the specific costs of the investment in mutual funds and the effects of the financial crisis on the industry of the investment funds on the national level. The financial crisis and the risk of infecting the global economy affected the taste of risk of the investors and their request for the investment fund, determining the orientation of the investors to the funds with a lower risk – the diversified funds, the funds of bonds and the monetary funds. I considered important the theoretical approach of the concept of investments in investment funds because they are a barometer of the macro economical stability, in case the <b>economical</b> <b>increase</b> is positive on the macro economical level the investments in investments funds are increasing too. In Romania the market of the mutual funds is at an incipient level, but with potential and perspectives of development. Due to the bankruptcy of FNI {{in the beginning of the}} years 2000 and due to the absence of a clear legislation regarding the calculation of the unitary value of the net asset and the control of the activity developed by the investment funds, the development of the industry of the investment funds had to fight against the crisis of credibility generated by these events. The convergence of the Romanian economy to the European standards will attract also a modification of the structure of the financial investments of the individuals, by an increase of the investments in funds. In the world the investment funds are preferred by the investors for their advantages, respectively the investment in instruments with larger capacity, the flexibility determined by the possibility of withdrawal in any moment without losing the cumulated gain, the administration of the portfolio by the professional administrators, the access to diversified placements with small sums, the reduction of the risk by the diversification, the strict regulation and surveillance of the activity of investments administration by the authorities surveying the financial markets. In the developed countries, the placements in administered investments can reach up to 40 % of the financial assets of the families, and the deposits own a percentage of 40 - 50 % of the assets, while in Romania the percentage of the investments administered of the total financial assets of the families is under 10 %, and the placements in deposits represents over 80 %. I consider that the founding of the subsidiaries of assets management in Romania by the banking financial groups contributed and will contribute in a great measure in the future to the increase of the degree of knowledge and acceptance of the investment in investment funds...|$|E
40|$|Membrane {{bioreactor}} (MBR) {{technology for}} treatment of organically contaminated wastewater {{is one of the}} notable developments in recent years. MBR technology is based on the ongoing development of biological water treatment with suspended biomass, where membranes are used to separate the biologically treated water from the biomass. Major benefits of MBR compared to existing technologies are the improved effluent quality and lower footprint. Both characteristics are of special interest in industrial applications, because in addition to environmental issues, the possibility exists for the direct/ indirect reuse of the treated water within the industrial process. However, applicability of MBRs relies on their technical feasibility and cost-effectiveness. Both criteria are primarily dependent on the filtration performance of the membrane unit, which determines membrane surface area required and operating costs, {{as well as on the}} cleaning efficiency or the treated effluent quality. In the municipal sector, there is substantial experience with MBR filtration and cleaning performance, due to the number of operating installations and similarity of the wastewater to be treated. In general, municipal MBR performance varies little between applications. In contrast, significant variations exist between industrial wastewater sectors, due to the highly application-dependent characteristics of industrial wastewaters. To date, most of the plants reflect specific applications and there is little detailed or transferable knowledge available to account for these differences in performance. In addition, much of the existing knowledge remains primarily with the technology providers and operators of MBR systems. In order to develop a basis for the optimal introduction of MBR technology within the industrial sector, a more accurate and comprehensive investigation of the differences in performance is required. Consequently, the primary goals of this work were to identify the key factors of MBR performance, to develop suitable methods for the characterization, quantification and – where feasible – prediction of MBR performance. Based on the gathered knowledge, advanced approaches for the improvement of MBR performance have been developed. Investigations of MBR performance were carried out by treating different water sources in MBR systems. Wastewaters were derived from the chemical, pharmaceutical, textile and paper industry as well as heavily loaded process wastewaters from solids disposal and biotreatment and sludge handling. The wastewaters used represent a wide range with respect to the types and concentrations of contaminants to be eliminated and their biodegradability. Consequently, a wide variety of filtration and cleaning performance was achieved during MBR treatment. For some of the treated wastewaters, a lack of performance indicated that MBR technology was not technically or economically viable. The biodegradability of soluble or low molecular weight organic compounds is a key factor in achieving the desired cleaning performance. A detailed assessment can be undertaken in analytical laboratory testing. In comparison, the molecular weight cut off of the applied micro- or ultrafiltration membranes is of minor importance. Desired filtration performance and especially variances from municipal applications are primarily determined by the fouling factors "colloidal fouling" and "scaling". Suitable methods have been developed to evaluate or forecast the fouling and scaling potential of mixed liquors and raw wastewaters. Further investigations indicated a high potential for optimizing performance. As an alternative to advanced treatment downstream the MBR, improvements in cleaning performance can be achieved by simultaneous addition of powdered activated carbon. Improvements of filtration performance through reduction of fouling and scaling potential were also successfully tested by upstream or simultaneous removal of related compounds. All approaches for optimization were critically evaluated to identify if and under which conditions a sustainable and <b>economical</b> <b>increase</b> in performance could be achieved. It is anticipated that the knowledge gathered in this work will help to solve operational problems of existing MBRs, improve MBR cost-effectiveness and further expand the applicability of MBRs to previously problematic industrial wastewater applications...|$|E

40|$|The main aim of my master’s thesis “Media {{representation}} of Estonians` migration from and to Estonia in 2004 - 2008 ” {{is to describe}} the media {{representation of}} Estonians` emigration from and immigration into Estonia {{in the period of}} 2004 - 2008. The current thesis sets a presumption that media representations have {{an important role in the}} development of people’s attitudes and behaviour and the media is presumed to have an impact on people’s migration intentions. Considering the presumptions the thesis aims at learning about the media representation of migration and statements given by experts on questions related to migration. In addition to the fore mentioned aims the connections between the statements presented in media, the results of earlier research and statements of experts are explained. The theoretical part of the thesis provides an overview of theory of media, theory of migration, Estonian population processes, Estonian political aims of migration, migration statistics and additionally of earlier research on the topic of the thesis. In the empirical part of the thesis the media representation of Estonians` migration is analysed mainly on the basis of the reasons for migration appeared in media articles, whereas an emphasis is placed on the context in which the reasons for migration are manifested mentioned. For the reason that migration is relevant on the national level as a possible cause for demographic changes, attention is paid to social reasons and influence of migration by giving an overview of media texts about the national political aims of migration. An additional aim of the research is to find out experts` statements about the reasons and influence of migration and to analyse these statements in relation to the national political aims of migration and media representation by comparing the results of the analysis with the statements of experts. Both qualitative and quantitative text analysis methods were used in the present research and an interview was conducted with three experts. The aim of the quantitative content analysis was to find out the frequency of articles on migration and the distribution of topics, whereas the sample consisted of articles of the period of 1 January, 2004 to 31. December, 2008 of daily newspapers “Postimees” and “Päevaleht”. 150 articles were analysed in total. The qualitative text analysis forms the main part of the research, the sample of it which is based on the quantitative sample, considering the wide range and thoroughness of the articles. The qualitative text analysis comprises of 59 articles. The results of the analysis are divided into three main parts: media representation of emigration, media representation of immigration and media representation of political aims of migration. The hypotheses of the current thesis are answered as follows: • the media representations of migration have become more varied throughout the period of research; • the reasons and influences of migration are appear on the media mainly in the context of labour market; • the topic/subject of immigration has become more popular throughout the period of research; • experts` statements about migration differ from media opinions. The results of the content analysis revel that migration is usually mentioned in daily newspapers as internal news and the authors of the respective articles are mainly journalists. Upon the results of the content analysis nine different topics were distinguished. That refers to the several different social contexts in which migration is manifested. Even though the differences in salary rates in the home country and foreign country are mentioned as the main reasons for migration throughout the research period, the reasons for migration in general work and living contexts are discussed in a similar, however more thorough, way in opinion articles, essays and interviews. Among the most significant results of the qualitative text analysis, in addition to the results of the questionnaire, there is a belief that migration in mainly caused by salary and working conditions. The <b>economical</b> <b>increase</b> that took place in the previous years in considered as a factor predisposing to immigration back to the country whereas the current decrease is considered to be a factor predisposing to emigration from the country. In addition to the fore mentioned, several other societal and personal reasons predispose to emigration. Most of the articles about the migration of Estonians can be described as having a critical attitude towards the actions of the country. The country is blamed for lack of attention to migration and ineffective measures of migration politics. In most cases migration politics is criticised when discussing the economical goals of the country, but also in the context of demographical indicators and cultural changes. As one of the most problematic questions, articles about migration bring out the difficulties arising from insufficient migration statistics which make it difficult to evaluate the extent and influence of migration and that gives basis to different interpretations about predicting the extent of migration. The results of interviews are in many aspects similar to the results of the text analysis, but to the contrary to media texts, experts share a standpoint that emigration is decreasing due to the decrease in economics. The biggest disagreement occurs in the evaluation of the media, that sees emigration to be arising in the near future, and experts, who believe the opposite. Taking into account the changes in the current society, the author of the thesis believes the topic of migration to become more sensitive, which, according to the results of the media analysis, can contribute to raising the number of those going abroad, on the other hand according to experts facilitate the return to Estonia...|$|E

30|$|To {{study the}} effect of number of TMFD units in MTMFD, the number of TMFD is varied as 1, 5 and 11. The {{response}} reduction of the structure with respect to varying parameters for different number of TMFD units is shown in Figs.  3, 4, 5 and 6. It is observed from these figures that the response reduction of structure is higher when the numbers of TMFD are 5 and 11. While in case of STMFD, the response reduction is comparatively less. It is also observed from these figures {{that there is a}} similar response reduction of MTMFD when it consists of 5 and 11 TMFD units implying that it will not be <b>economical</b> to <b>increase</b> the number of TMFD units beyond 5. Thus, after an increase in number of TMFD units in a MTMFD the reduction in response remains almost the same.|$|R
