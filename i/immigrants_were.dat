5|$|From 1881 through 1914, {{approximately}} 2million Jews {{immigrated to}} the United States from Europe. An estimated three-quarters of them settled in New York City, primarily in the Lower East Side. Over 75,000 of these <b>immigrants</b> <b>were</b> from Romania, where Jews faced antisemitic laws, violence and expulsion. These hardships, combined with low crop yields and economic depression, resulted in 30 percent of the Jews in Romania emigrating to the United States.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, the Scottish {{population}} {{reached an}} all-time high of 5.25 million people. The reasons given were that, in Scotland, births were outnumbering the number of deaths, and <b>immigrants</b> <b>were</b> moving to Scotland from overseas. In 2011, 43,700 people moved from Wales, Northern Ireland or England to live in Scotland.|$|E

30|$|Recent {{papers have}} found that often <b>immigrants</b> <b>are</b> overqualified {{relative}} to native-born workers when comparing an individual’s education to the ‘average’ education in their occupation. We show that these results are sensitive to differences in the education distribution between immigrants and the native born. Using data for New Zealand, which has an immigration policy that favours skilled immigrants, we find that this approach leads one to conclude that <b>immigrants</b> <b>are,</b> on average, overqualified for their occupation. However, once we account {{for the fact that}} <b>immigrants</b> <b>are</b> on average more skilled than natives, we find that <b>immigrants</b> <b>are,</b> in fact, less overeducated than natives.|$|R
30|$|First {{generation}} <b>immigrants</b> <b>are</b> {{defined as}} people not born in Germany. Those who are born in Germany but (a) {{do not hold}} German citizenship, or (b) {{have at least one}} parent who is not German-born or of non-German nationality are called second generation immigrants. Both first and second generation <b>immigrants</b> <b>are</b> considered in this analysis, assuming that members of the second generation are not fully assimilated and still differ in their behavior, at least partly, from natives. Marriage between first and second generation <b>immigrants</b> <b>is</b> therefore treated as immigrant marriage, while marriages between natives and second generation <b>immigrants</b> <b>are</b> considered intermarriages.|$|R
5|$|Legislative {{restrictions}} on immigration (such as the Continuous journey regulation and Chinese Immigration Act) that had favoured British and other European <b>immigrants</b> <b>were</b> amended in the 1960s, opening {{the doors to}} immigrants {{from all parts of}} the world. While the 1950s had still seen high levels of immigration by Europeans, by the 1970s <b>immigrants</b> <b>were</b> increasingly Chinese, Indian, Vietnamese, Jamaican and Haitian. During the late 1960s and early 1970s, Canada received many American Vietnam War draft dissenters. Throughout the late 1980s and 1990s, Canada's growing Pacific trade brought with it a large influx of South Asians, who tended to settle in British Columbia. Immigrants of all backgrounds tend to settle in the major urban centres. The Canadian public, as well as the major political parties, are tolerant of immigrants.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} <b>immigrants</b> <b>were</b> from China. Several hundred Chinese arrived in California in 1849 and 1850, and in 1852 more than 20,000 landed in San Francisco. Their {{distinctive}} dress and appearance was highly recognizable in the goldfields. Chinese miners suffered enormously, enduring violent racism from white miners who aimed their frustrations at foreigners. To this day, {{there has been}} no justice for known victims. Further animosity toward the Chinese led to legislation such as the Chinese Exclusion Act and Foreign Miners Tax.|$|E
5|$|According to estimates, around 77,980 Armenians {{lived in}} the US by 1919. An {{unprecedented}} number of Armenians entered the country in 1920, but the Immigration Act of 1924 that restricted immigration from southern and eastern Europe barred many other Armenians from emigrating to the US. Most of the post-World War I <b>immigrants</b> <b>were</b> women and children, {{in contrast to the}} prewar immigration, which was predominantly young and male. Like Italians, for whom this practice was known as campanilismo, Armenian communities were often formed by people from the same village or town in the Ottoman Empire. This practice almost entirely disappeared after World War II.|$|E

30|$|When {{looking at}} the {{education}} level, we observe a curvilinear relationship with age at migration and education level. The higher the age at migration, the higher the probability that an <b>immigrant</b> <b>is</b> highly educated. It is the opposite result in terms of middle and low education. Female and married <b>immigrants</b> <b>are</b> {{more likely to be}} highly educated. However, <b>immigrants</b> with children <b>were</b> less likely to be highly educated. In line with expectations, an <b>immigrant</b> <b>is</b> {{much more likely to be}} highly educated if the human capital for the region of origin is higher.|$|R
5|$|According to the Bureau of Immigration, 54,057 Armenians {{entered the}} US between 1899 and 1917. The top listed {{countries}} of origin were Turkey (46,474), Russia (3,034), Canada (1,577), Great Britain (914) and Egypt (894). <b>Immigrants</b> <b>were</b> asked to indicate which state {{they were going to}} settle in; for Armenians, the most popular answers were New York (17,391), Massachusetts (14,192), Rhode Island (4,923), Illinois (3,313), California (2,564), New Jersey (2,115), Pennsylvania (2,002), Michigan (1,371).

5|$|As {{president}} Reitz {{was one of}} {{the first}} Afrikaners to actively develop a so-called Bantu policy, in philosophy and terminology going beyond contemporary ideas on segregation between white and black. Under his government Indian <b>immigrants</b> <b>were</b> by law forbidden to settle in the Orange Free State (1890). This led to a confrontation with the British government and an extensive correspondence between Reitz and the British high commissioner in Cape Town, in which internal sovereignty was claimed and established.|$|E
5|$|Canada {{has one of}} {{the highest}} per-capita {{immigration}} rates in the world, driven mainly by economic policy and, to a lesser extent, family reunification. The Canadian public as-well as the major political parties support the current level of immigration. In 2014, a total of 260,400 <b>immigrants</b> <b>were</b> admitted to Canada. The Canadian government anticipated between 280,000 and 305,000 new permanent residents in the following years. a similar number of immigrants as in recent years. New immigrants settle mostly in major urban areas such as Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Canada also accepts large numbers of refugees, accounting for over 10 percent of annual global refugee resettlements.|$|E

5|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century, Irish {{people began to}} arrive in large numbers in Coatbridge. The 1851 UK Census {{recorded}} that Irish people constituted 35.8% of the local population.

In 1985, 56% of the population of Coatbridge were Roman Catholic.|$|E
5|$|Immigration {{became an}} {{important}} issue for the Vlaams Blok from the late 1980s. Interconnected with the Flemish nationalism issue, <b>immigrants</b> <b>were</b> {{considered to be a}} threat to the Flemish ethnic community. In 1992, the party established its 70-point plan, which included measures to stop all immigration, return most immigrants to their native countries by force, and legally discriminate against residing migrants in respect of markets such as labour, housing and education. The party's opponents particularly saw its immigration program as a source of claims of racism, and the party thus in its latest years downplayed the relevance of the 70-point plan, and softened its written positions regarding immigration.|$|E

Theodore Jurewicz.|$|E
40|$|The goal of {{the paper}} is the {{estimation}} of the marginal productivity of immigrants relative to natives. One reason why firms may hire <b>immigrants</b> <b>is</b> because <b>immigrants</b> <b>are</b> more productive than natives. I test this hyphotesis using a confidential matched employer-employee dataset from Germany for the years 1996 - 2004. Using a production function approach, I find that <b>immigrants</b> <b>are</b> similar to natives in terms of productivity and wages. Hence, the benefits of immigration need to come from non-wage sources or immigrant labor flexibility...|$|R
30|$|Hypothesis 1, {{which states}} that <b>Immigrants</b> <b>are</b> more {{religious}} than the native population, is clearly supported by the European data: the coefficients of first-generation European <b>immigrants</b> <b>are</b> positive and significant for the two dimensions of religiosity, indicating that first-generation <b>immigrants</b> in Europe <b>are</b> indeed more religious than the native population (the reference group) 15.

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 19th century, immigration, {{urbanisation}} and industrialisation {{transformed the}} territories, destroying the old frontier way of life. Three million immigrants arrived in Canada between 1910 and 1914, many of them from eastern Europe, and over half of them settled in the territories. The urban population grew significantly as new towns were established across the Prairies. Many of the <b>immigrants</b> <b>were</b> employed by the growing industries of the region, especially the large mining and manufacturing centres enabled by the Canadian Pacific Railway. As society changed, there were fears of immigrants and criminals exploiting the new rail network.|$|E
5|$|A {{long and}} winding route {{had to be}} taken to reach topside; the steerage-class accommodation, located on C through G decks, was at the extreme ends of the decks, and so was the {{farthest}} away from the lifeboats. By contrast, the first-class accommodation was located on the upper decks and so was nearest. Proximity to the lifeboats thus became a key factor in determining who got into them. To add to the difficulty, many of the steerage passengers did not understand or speak English. It was perhaps no coincidence that English-speaking Irish <b>immigrants</b> <b>were</b> disproportionately represented among the steerage passengers who survived. Many of those who did survive owed their lives to third-class steward John Edward Hart, who organised three trips into the ship's interior to escort groups of third-class passengers up to the boat deck. Others made their way through open barriers or climbed emergency ladders.|$|E

5|$|After the Declaration of the Establishment of the State of Israel on 14 May 1948 Haifa {{became the}} gateway for Jewish {{immigration}} into Israel. During the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the neighborhoods of Haifa were sometimes contested. After the war, Jewish <b>immigrants</b> <b>were</b> settled in new neighborhoods, among them Kiryat Hayim, Ramot Remez, Ramat Shaul, Kiryat Sprinzak, and Kiryat Eliezer. Bnei Zion Hospital (formerly Rothschild Hospital) and the Central Synagogue in Hadar Hacarmel date from this period. In 1953, {{a master plan}} was created for transportation and the future architectural layout. In 1959, a group of Sephardi and Mizrahi Jews, mostly Moroccan Jews, rioted in Wadi Salib, claiming the state was discriminating against them. Their demand for “bread and work” was directed at the state institutions and what they viewed as an Ashkenazi elite in the Labor Party and the Histadrut.|$|E

The educational philosophy accepted by schoolmasters and governmental administrators was that English was the language of scholars, and that Welsh was a barrier to moral and commercial prosperity. In 1901 35.4% of Rhondda workers spoke only English but by 1911 this had risen to 43.1%, while Welsh speaking monoglots had dropped from 11.4% to 4.4% in the same period.|$|E
