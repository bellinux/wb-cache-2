5|$|A {{separate}} device {{known as}} the combo preamp is necessary to connect a vintage Leslie to another instrument such as a guitar. This combines a separate AC input and line level input onto a single amphenol connector, and provide a <b>footswitch</b> to select between the speeds of the Leslie. Modern products such as the Trek II UC-1A allow any instrument with a phone jack connection to {{use a variety of}} Leslie speakers.|$|E
5|$|The {{connectors}} at {{the back}} of the Stage allow the connection of a sustain pedal, a swell pedal for organ, a <b>footswitch</b> to select the rotary speaker emulation speed, and a control pedal to modify effects such as wah-wah. A set of screw-in legs are an available option for the 88 and 76 note models and a custom designed soft case is also available from Clavia. A third party company, Ocean Beach Digital, has manufactured a set of MIDI controlled drawbars for the Nord Stage, for users who prefer to use real drawbars instead of the buttons provided as standard.|$|E
500|$|The 122 is {{the most}} popular Leslie. It was {{specifically}} designed for the Hammond organ and is the model most commonly identified with it. It is [...] high, contains separate motors for chorale and tremolo, and a 40 watt tube amplifier. The 122 {{is the most}} adaptable to being recorded, as it has a balanced signal which eliminates mains hum and other noise. The 122RV was the same model, but with an additional reverb amplifier, which fed through to a separate static speaker. A slightly smaller version, the [...] 142 was available. Hammond-Suzuki currently manufacture the 122A, a straight reissue of the 122, and the 122XB, which contains a modern 11-pin adapter, an IECC mains adaptor, line-in, and a jack socket for a <b>footswitch</b> to control the speed. This eliminates the need for a combo preamp.|$|E

40|$|Objectives To {{test the}} {{validity}} of the StepWatch Activity Monitor (SAM) in subjects with stroke against 2 criterion standards, 3 -dimensional gait analysis (3 -DGA) and <b>footswitches</b> in a variety of indoor and outdoor walking conditions, including different speeds and different terrains, and to test the accuracy of the SAM when worn on the paretic limb. Design Criterion standard validation study. Setting Gait laboratory and outside course. Participants Twenty-five participants with physical disability after stroke. Interventions Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures The total step count measured simultaneously by SAM and either 3 -DGA or <b>footswitches</b> for both paretic and nonparetic limbs. Results The total step count measured by the SAM and 3 -DGA was highly correlated (nonparetic limb, r=. 959; paretic limb, r=. 896). The 95 % limits of agreement (LOA) (derived from Bland-Altman analysis) between the SAM and 3 -DGA were within ± 10 steps for SAMs worn on either the nonparetic or paretic limb. The total step count measured simultaneously by the SAM and <b>footswitches</b> was also highly correlated for each limb (nonparetic, r=. 999; paretic, r=. 963). The 95 % LOA between the SAM and <b>footswitches</b> were ± 9 steps on the nonparetic limb but higher at ± 57 steps on the paretic limb. Further analysis showed that the measurement differences occurred during the outdoor component of the combined walk. The 95 % LOA between <b>footswitches</b> on both limbs were not more than ± 9 steps for walking, suggesting that the error was accounted for by the SAM on the paretic limb, which both over- and underread the total step count in the outdoor walking conditions. Conclusions Criterion validity of the SAM to measure steps in both clinical and natural environments has been established when used on the nonparetic limb. However, more errors are apparent when the SAM is worn on the paretic limb while walking over a variety of outdoor terrains. Validation is recommended before use in patients with neurologic conditions affecting bilateral legs because there may be more error, particularly in outdoor activities...|$|R

40|$|Events and phases {{detection}} {{of the human}} gait are vital for controlling prosthesis, orthosis and functional electrical stimulation (FES) systems. Wearable sensors are inexpensive, portable and have fast processing capability. They are frequently used to assess spatio-temporal, kinematic and kinetic parameters of the human gait which in turn provide more details about the human voluntary control and ampute-eprosthesis interaction. This paper presents a reliable real-time gait event detection algorithm based on simple heuristics approach, applicable to signals from tri-axial gyroscope for lower limb amputees during ramp ascending and descending. Experimental validation is done {{by comparing the results}} of gyroscope signal with <b>footswitches.</b> For healthy subjects, the mean difference between events detected by gyroscope and <b>footswitches</b> is 14 ms and 10. 5 ms for initial contact (IC) whereas for toe off (TO) it is - 5 ms and - 25 ms for ramp up and down respectively. For transfemoral amputee, the error is slightly higher either due to the placement of <b>footswitches</b> underneath the foot or the lack of proper knee flexion and ankle plantarflexion/dorsiflexion during ramp up and down. Finally, repeatability tests showed promising results...|$|R
5000|$|The Mark IIC finally {{remedied}} the {{two major}} problems of the IIA and the IIB, which were the noisy reverb circuit, and a <b>footswitching</b> system that produced a popping noise when activated. The Mark IIC featured a quieter <b>footswitching</b> system based on optocouplers to reroute the signal, and a new mod to the reverb circuit. The reverb modification involved resistor swaps and a change in ground lead placement. That modification {{is still on the}} books of 'official' mods, which they send to their authorized techs; it runs about $50." [...] Mesa/Boogie no longer does this modification at its own factory. The Mark IIC also featured a new Pull Bass shift on the front panel, which slightly extended the low frequencies in the preamp.|$|R

40|$|The GAITRite {{system is}} a {{validated}} portable gait analysis system that allows simple objective gait measurements. The limited length of the active area of the GAITRite system may be a limitation in obtaining reliable measures of stride-to-stride variability. In contrast, the SMTEC <b>footswitches</b> system provides a continuous measurement of temporal step parameters for a long distance and a long period (around 24 h). The aim {{of the study was}} to examine the concurrent validity of the SMTEC <b>footswitches</b> system with the GAITRite system for the measurement of temporal steps parameters. Step, stride, swing and stance time were simultaneously recorded using SMTEC and GAITRite systems while walking at normal, slow and fast self-selected walking speed among 13 healthy young adults. The level of agreement between both systems was high as for the stride time with intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) between 0. 95 and 0. 99 (P< 0. 001) and repeatability coefficients (RC) between 1. 1 % and 1. 5 % of mean values, whereas the lowest level of agreement was shown at fast self-selected walking speed and for stance time (ICC= 0. 52 with P< 0. 001 and RC= 4. 9 %). Furthermore, the measurement of individual footstep data was excellent with an agreement ranging between - 0. 04 and 0. 04 s (Pitman's test of difference in variance: r=- 0. 009, P= 0. 772). The present results suggest that the SMTEC <b>footswitches</b> system provides a valid and reliable measurement of temporal gait parameters in healthy young adults...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a project to evaluate different methods of gait cycle selection on the analysis of electromyography recorded during gait. Electromyography (EMG) describes the electrical activity associated with the muscle and is often interpreted in gait analysis using a simultaneously obtained signal to identify phases of the gait cycle. Phase transitions are often selected manually from reference signals derived from additional instrumentation, such as pressure platforms, <b>footswitches</b> and video cameras. We propose two methods (automatic and semi-automatic) {{as an alternative to the}} more traditional manual selection, and analyse how the gait cycle selection affects the EMG analysis. To quantify the differences between the gait cycles obtained using each method and to classify each cycle, three indices have been introduced. The effect of the gait cycle selection has been evaluated with respect to the EMG step profiles and temporal gait descriptors. An asymptomatic adult, an asymptomatic child and two children with cerebral palsy were examined using telemetric EMG devices and pressure <b>footswitches.</b> The results obtained showed that the method of gait cycle selection did not have a major influence for the adult, but it altered considerably the analysis in the case of the children with cerebral palsy...|$|R
