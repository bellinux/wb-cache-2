40|$|Abstract- Design of new <b>fixture</b> is a {{modified}} {{over the old}} <b>fixture</b> due to some drawback. The old <b>fixture</b> is not suitable for drum having slot on top face. This {{is because of the}} brake drum is seated on <b>fixture</b> ring instead of button so there is no gap maintained. Without sufficient gap it is difficult to machine the brake drum bore(pilot diameter), as well as brake drum surface in single set up to achieve the concentricity. Also current <b>fixture</b> is complicated in design and there is more work in fitting the button to <b>fixture</b> ring. So we designed new lathe <b>fixture</b> over the old <b>fixture.</b> In new modified lathe <b>fixture,</b> pads are provided instead of buttons and it could be suitable for brake drum having slot on the top face and other drum also. By trail run this lathe <b>fixture</b> is more comfortable than old <b>fixture.</b> So this <b>fixture</b> can be used in brake drum (cargo) manufacturing companies because of its simple design and less cost...|$|R

40|$|Manufacturing and {{assembly}} processes often require objects {{to be held}} {{in such a way that}} they can resist all external wrenches. The problem of "fixture planning" is to compute, for a given object and a set of <b>fixturing</b> elements, the set of placements of the <b>fixturing</b> elements that constrain all finite and infinitesimal motions of the object (due to applied wrenches). As <b>fixturing</b> problems occur frequently in manufacturing {{and assembly}}, it becomes costly to build a dedicated <b>fixturing</b> solution for each different problem. Modular <b>fixturing</b> toolkits offer the advantage of reusability of the <b>fixturing</b> elements and have therefore gained considerable popularity. A modular <b>fixturing</b> toolkit consists of a <b>fixturing</b> table with a rectangular grid of holes, and a set of <b>fixturing</b> elements whose positions are restricted to the holes in the table. Several recent publications in the field of <b>fixture</b> planning aim at exploring the power of these modular <b>fixturing</b> toolkits. We give an overview of modul [...] ...|$|R

Models of <b>fixture</b> kinematics and <b>fixture</b> stiffness were generated and used to design a proof-of-concept prototype. When operated in <b>fixture</b> mode, experiments show standard deviation in point-to-point repeatability of 11, 11, and 40 nm in x, y, and z; and 0. 7, 0. 3, and 0. 3 micro-radians in Tx, Ty and Tz.
