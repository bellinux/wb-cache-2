Methods: In sera samples obtained from 180 <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers,</b> hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg), hepatitis B surface antibody (anti-HBs), HCV antibody (anti-HCV) and HIV antibody (anti-HIV) markers were tested by chemiluminescent immunoassay with Advia Centaur (Siemens) autoanalyser. Results: We found HBsAg positive and anti-HBs negative in 2 <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> (1. 1 %); HBsAg negative and anti-HBs positive in 123 <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> (68. 3 %); HBsAg negative and anti-HBs negative in 55 <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> (30. 6 %); 2 <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> (1. 1 %) anti-HCV antibody positive in 115 (63. 3 %) girls and 65 (36. 7 %) boys on the way total 180 <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers.</b> None of these patients found HIV antibody.

As the HBsAg positivity rate was detected expected low, anti-HBs positivity rate was detected expected high.

40|$|Abstract Background Because {{of their}} {{peculiar}} sociocultural background, <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> in sub-Saharan African subcultures may have various conceptions on {{different aspects of}} autism spectrum disorders (ASD), such as etiology, treatment and issues of prognosis. These various conceptions, if different from current knowledge in literature about ASD, may negatively influence help-seeking behavior of {{parents of children with}} ASD who seek advice and information from the <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers.</b> This study assessed the opinions of <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> in Nigeria on aspects of etiology, treatability and preventability of childhood autism, and relates their opinions to the sociodemographic variables. Methods <b>Healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> working in four tertiary healthcare facilities located in the south-east and south-south regions of Nigeria were interviewed with a sociodemographic questionnaire, personal opinion on etiology, treatability and preventability of childhood autism (POETPCA) questionnaire and knowledge about childhood autism among health workers (KCAHW) questionnaire to assess their knowledge and opinions on various aspects of childhood autism. Results A total of 134 <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> participated in the study. In all, 78 (58. 2 %), 19 (14. 2 %) and 36 (26. 9 %) of the <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> were of the opinion that the etiology of childhood autism can be explained by natural, preternatural and supernatural causes, respectively. One (0. 7 %) of the <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> was unsure of the explanation of the etiology. Knowledge about childhood autism as measured by scores on the KCAHW questionnaire was the only factor significantly associated with the opinions of the <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> on etiology of childhood autism. In all, 73 (54. 5 %) and 43 (32. 1 %), of the <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> subscribed to the opinion that childhood autism is treatable and preventable respectively. Previous involvement with managing children with ASD significantly influenced the opinion of the <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> in subscribing to treatability of childhood autism, while working experience of less than 6 years among the <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> significantly influenced the opinion of the <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> in admitting to believing in the preventability of childhood autism. Conclusion In designing policies and programs to change negative opinions or beliefs of <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> about childhood autism, {{there is a need for}} baseline information such as this survey. Changing the negative opinions or beliefs of the <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> about childhood autism should encourage appropriate help-seeking behavior among parents of children with ASD who may be seeking advice or information from the <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers.</b> This would encourage early interventions, which are essential to prognosis of childhood autism. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Challenges exist {{regarding}} TB {{infection control}} and TB in hospital-based <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> in South Africa. However, few studies report on TB in non-hospital based <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> such as primary or community <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers.</b> Our objectives were {{to investigate the}} implementation of TB infection control measures at primary healthcare facilities, the smear positive TB incidence rate amongst primary <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> and the association between TB infection control measures and all types of TB in <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers.</b> METHODS: One hundred and thirty three primary healthcare facilities were visited in five provinces of South Africa in 2009. At each facility, a TB infection control audit and facility questionnaire were completed. The number of <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> who had had TB {{during the past three}} years was obtained. RESULTS: The standardised incidence ratio of smear positive TB in primary <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> indicated an incidence rate of more than double that of the general population. In a univariable logistic regression, the infection control audit score was significantly associated with reported cases of TB in <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> (OR= 1. 04, 95 %CI 1. 01 - 1. 08, p= 0. 02) as was the number of staff (OR= 3. 78, 95 %CI 1. 77 - 8. 08). In the multivariable analysis, the number of staff remained significantly associated with TB in <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> (OR= 3. 33, 95 %CI 1. 37 - 8. 08). CONCLUSION: The high rate of TB in <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> suggests a substantial nosocomial transmission risk, but the infection control audit tool which was used did not perform adequately as a measure of this risk. Infection control measures should be monitored by validated tools developed and tested locally. Different strategies, such as routine surveillance systems, could be used to evaluate the burden of TB in <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> in order to calculate TB incidence, monitor trends and implement interventions to decrease occupational TB...|$|R

The participants were recruited from the departments of infectious diseases in four hospitals which treated HIV/AIDS. The questionnaire included demographics, the Maslach Burnout Inventory-General Survey (MBI-GS), the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL- 90), the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), and the Trait Coping Style Questionnaire (TCSQ). Results A total of 512 questionnaires were distributed; 501 questionnaires were completed and collected (the response rate was 97. 9  %). After eliminating nine invalid questionnaires (1. 80  %), 264 physicians and nurses caring for HIV/AIDS and 228 physicians and nurses caring for other infectious diseases provided valid responses (98. 2  %). The HIV/AIDS healthcare workers’ scores on the emotional exhaustion (F[*]=[*] 6. 350, p[*]=[*] 0. 012) and depersonalization dimensions (F[*]=[*] 8. 533, p[*]=[*] 0. 004) were significantly higher than other <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers.</b> The HIV/AIDS <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> had higher total scores and positive items on the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL- 90) compared with other <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers.</b> Low job satisfaction, serious somatization, interpersonal sensitivity, poor quality of sleep, high psychoticism scores, and use of negative coping styles were frequently associated with burnout.

The {{aim of this study}} was to explore the perceptions of <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers,</b> policy makers and the community on the shortage of <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> in Botswana. Fifteen focus group discussions were conducted with three groups of policy makers, six groups of <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> and six groups of community members in rural, urban and remote rural health districts of Botswana. All the participants were 18 years and older. Recruitment was purposive and the framework method was used to inductively analyse the data. There was a perceived shortage of <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers</b> in primary <b>healthcare,</b> which was believed to result from an increased need for health services, inequitable distribution of <b>healthcare</b> <b>workers,</b> migration and too few such workers being trained.
