50|$|An {{antistatic}} wrist strap, <b>ESD</b> <b>wrist</b> <b>strap,</b> {{or ground}} bracelet is an antistatic device used to safely ground a person working on very sensitive electronic equipment, {{to prevent the}} buildup of static electricity on their body, which can result in electrostatic discharge (ESD). It {{is used in the}} electronics industry by workers working on electronic devices which can be damaged by ESD, and also sometimes by people working around explosives, to prevent electric sparks which could set off an explosion. It consists of an elastic band of fabric with fine conductive fibers woven into it, attached to a wire with a clip on the end to connect it to a ground conductor. The fibers are usually made of carbon or carbon-filled rubber, and the strap is bound with a stainless steel clasp or plate. They are usually used in conjunction with an antistatic mat on the workbench, or a special static-dissipating plastic laminate on the workbench surface.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a distance detector {{composed of two}} separated metal-oxide semiconductor field-effect transistors (MOSFETs), a differential polysilicon cross-shaped Hall plate (CSHP), and a readout circuit. The distance detector was fabricated using 0. 18 μm 1 P 6 M Complementary Metal-Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) technology to sense the magnetic induction perpendicular to the chip surface. The differential polysilicon CSHP enabled the magnetic device to not only increase the magnetosensitivity but also eliminate the offset voltage generated because of device mismatch and Lorentz force. Two MOSFETs generated two drain currents with a quadratic function of the differential Hall voltages at CSHP. A readout circuit—composed of a current-to-voltage converter, a low-pass filter, and a difference amplifier—was designed to amplify the current difference between two drains of MOSFETs. Measurements revealed that the electrostatic discharge (ESD) could be eliminated from the distance sensor by grounding it to earth; however, the sensor could be desensitized by ESD {{in the absence of}} grounding. The magnetic influence can be ignored if the magnetic body (human) stays far from the magnetic sensor, and the measuring system is grounded to earth by using the <b>ESD</b> <b>wrist</b> <b>strap</b> (Strap E-GND). Both ‘no grounding’ and ‘grounding to power supply’ conditions were unsuitable for measuring the induced Hall voltage...|$|E
50|$|The <b>wrist</b> <b>strap</b> is used {{to secure}} the grip to the gymnast's hand and to {{transfer}} body weight from the fingers to the wrist. It encircles the wrist and is then locked in place with either velcro or buckles. Gymnasts typically wear soft material, such as cloth wristbands, under the <b>wrist</b> <b>straps</b> to prevent skin chafing. Some brands of grips include soft, removable pads that fit under the <b>wrist</b> <b>straps.</b>|$|R

5000|$|<b>Wrist</b> straps: <b>Wrist</b> <b>straps</b> (lifting straps) are {{sometimes}} used {{to assist in}} gripping very heavy weights. <b>Wrist</b> <b>straps</b> {{can be used to}} isolate muscle groups like in [...] "lat pull-downs", where the trainee would primarily use the latissimus dorsi muscles of the back rather than the biceps. They are particularly useful for the deadlift. Some lifters avoid using <b>wrist</b> <b>straps</b> to develop their grip strength, just as some go further by using thick bars. <b>Wrist</b> <b>straps</b> can allow a lifter initially to use more weight than {{they might be able to}} handle safely for an entire set, as unlike simply holding a weight, if it is dropped then the lifter must descend with it or be pulled down. Straps place stress on the bones of the wrist which can be potentially harmful if excessive.|$|R

40|$|Objectives To {{test the}} {{effectiveness}} of a typical magnetic <b>wrist</b> <b>strap</b> for reducing pain and stiffness, and for improving physical functioning amongst patients with osteoarthritis. Design A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. Each participant wore four devices over a 16 -week period. Setting Forty five patients with osteoarthritis were recruited from general practices in rural and urban areas of Yorkshire. Interventions Experimental device: a commercially available magnetic <b>wrist</b> <b>strap.</b> Control devices: a weak magnetic <b>wrist</b> <b>strap,</b> a demagnetised <b>wrist</b> <b>strap,</b> and a copper bracelet. Main outcome measures The WOMAC Osteoarthritis Index, the McGill Pain Questionnaire—Pain Rating Index (PRI), a pain visual analogue scale (VAS), and medication use. Results No difference was observed between devices in terms of their effects on pain as measured by the primary outcome measure (WOMAC A), the PRI and the VAS. Similar results were obtained for stiffness (WOMAC B), physical function (WOMAC C), and medication use. Further analyses of the PRI subscales revealed a statistically significant difference between devices (P = 0. 025), which favoured the experimental device. Participants reported lower sensory pain after wearing the standard magnetic <b>wrist</b> <b>strap,</b> than when wearing control devices. However, no adjustment was made for multiple testing. Conclusions Our results indicate that magnetic and copper bracelets are generally ineffective for managing pain, stiffness and physical function in osteoarthritis. Reported therapeutic benefits are most likely attributable to non-specific placebo effects. However such devices have no major adverse effects and may provide hope...|$|R

40|$|Background: Folklore {{remedies}} for pain and inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis include {{the application of}} magnets and copper to the skin. Despite the popular use of devices containing magnets or copper for this purpose, {{little research has been}} conducted to evaluate the efficacy of such treatments. Objective: To investigate whether the practice of wearing magnetic <b>wrists</b> <b>straps,</b> or copper bracelets, offers any specific therapeutic benefit for patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Design: Randomised double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial. Methods: 70 patients, aged 33 to 79 years and predominantly female (n = 52), with painful rheumatoid arthritis were recruited from general practices within Yorkshire. Participants were randomly allocated to wear four devices in a different order. Devices tested were: a standard (1502 to 2365 gauss) magnetic <b>wrist</b> <b>strap,</b> a demagnetised (, 20 gauss) <b>wrist</b> <b>strap,</b> an attenuated (250 to 350 gauss) magnetic <b>wrist</b> <b>strap,</b> and a copper bracelet. Devices were each worn for five weeks, with treatment phases being separated by one week wash-out periods. The primary outcome measured was pain using a 100 mm visual analogue scale. Secondary pain measures were the McGill Pain Questionnaire and tender joint count. Inflammation was assessed using C-reactive protein and plasma viscosity blood tests and by swollen joint count. Physical function was assessed using the Health Assessment Questionnaire (Disability Index). Disease activity and medication us...|$|R

40|$|Device {{designed}} {{in the form of}} a wrist watch attached to the wrist having a housing (2) and a <b>wrist</b> <b>strap</b> (3) and at least one ultrasonic sensor attached to the <b>wrist</b> <b>strap</b> (3) comprising at least one ultrasonic emitter and one ultrasonic receiver and directed onto the radial artery in conjunction with an electronic evaluation device accommodated in the housing (2) for the detection and display (24) of circulation parameters, in particular the pulse rate, which can be derived from the systolic signals supplied by the sensor (1) as a result of the ultrasonic Doppler effect. The sensor (1) is designed and attached to the <b>wrist</b> <b>strap</b> (3) so that the systolic signals can be optimized on applying the device and this condition is maintained irrespective of hand and arm movements. Interference signals which can still not be eliminated in this way are prevented from having an effect on the display (24) of the device by a suitably designed evaluation device. A further development permits the de tection and display of the systolic blood pressure and the myocardial oxygen requirement...|$|R
