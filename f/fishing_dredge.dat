50|$|A <b>fishing</b> <b>dredge,</b> {{also known}} as a scallop dredge or oyster dredge, is a kind of dredge which is towed along {{the bottom of the sea}} by a fishing boat in order to collect a {{targeted}} edible bottom-dwelling species. The gear is used to fish for scallops, oysters and other species of clams, crabs, and sea cucumber. The dredge is then winched up into the boat and emptied. Dredges are also used in connection with the work of the naturalist in marine biology, notably on the Challenger Expedition.|$|E

40|$|Clam-dredging {{results in}} the {{exposure}} of Spisula solida individuals not caught by the dredge. Subsequent survival depends on clam damage, reburial time, and the time needed by predators to reach the impacted area. We analyse these variables and discuss the importance of predation on exposed S. solida caused by dredge fishing. Sampling was performed in July 2000 off the southern coast of Portugal, at Vilamoura, a traditional S. solida sandy fishing ground. We compared the time needed for S. solida individuals to rebury themselves, relative to the abundance of potential predators. Bivalves collected by divers {{were placed on the}} seabed, and the times required for reburial were measured. These were compared with the times needed for reburial of the clams exposed by dredge impact. At each of three dredge tracks, we analysed the number of predators that entered three equal quadrats (0. 0250 m 2) per minute. These results were compared with a non-affected control area. Impact caused by the <b>fishing</b> <b>dredge</b> significantly increases the number of exposed S. solida clams ðp < 0 : 05 Þ and the abundance of potential predatory species ðp < 0 : 05 Þ. The brittle star Ophiura texturata was the most abundant and first species to reach the dredge track (less than 3 min after dredge impact). Other species reaching the dredge track were Pomatochistus spp. (6 min after impact), Diogenes pugilator, and Nassarius reticulatus (both 9 min after impact). Although predators reached the impacted area while S. solida bivalves were still exposed, our results suggest that predation on the non-buried clams in the dredge track is not a major factor for subsequent indirect mortality of S. solida...|$|E
40|$|The present {{research}} aims at examining commercial fishermen’s subjective resilience to management changes in two Southern New England fishing ports. This study also aims at analyzing {{the relationship between}} job satisfaction and level of occupational attachment with fishermen’s perceived ability to adapt and cope to change. The two age groups examined were categorized into a younger and older generation by splitting the mean age value of 46. 6 to 45 for the older generation. Three hypotheses were developed: 1) Management practices have negatively influenced older fishermen’s perceptions {{on their ability to}} adapt to changes, where younger fishers perceive to be more resilient to management changes; 2) Level of resilience varies between fishing gear types. For example, those fishers participating in net fisheries perceive to be less resilient and able to adapt to changes than those <b>fishing</b> <b>dredge</b> gear; and 3) Between port differences may influence the relationships between variables in the first two hypotheses. In order to test these hypotheses, a total of 92 interviews were conducted with fishermen from the ports of Point Judith, Rhode Island and New Bedford, Massachusetts. Results of analyses show that there is no difference between age groups on fishermen’s perceived level of resilience. However, results show a positive relationship between age and fishermen’s Perceptions of Risk. Those involved in dredge gear fisheries (scallop, ocean clam/quahog) were shown to be more confident in their ability to adapt and cope to management changes. Results suggest that income and monetary gains {{play an important role in}} fishermen’s perception of their ability to adapt and cope with changes. Correlations between levels of job satisfaction components suggest that a decrease in satisfaction with income and financial needs could result in lower levels of perceived ability to adapt and cope with management changes. Results from this study have the potential to contribute to the expansion of knowledge and inspire future research about the adaptability of fishermen for future policy strategies. ...|$|E

40|$|In 2014 a benthic infauna {{survey was}} carried out in Swansea Bay (Wales, UK), an {{industrial}}ised embayment with a long history of shipping, industrial and domestic pollution, <b>fishing,</b> <b>dredging</b> and spoil disposal. The purpose of the survey was to generate up-to-date baseline information about the benthic communities in the area, and also to compare the current situation with a similar survey carried out 30 years ago. In 2014 grab samples were retrieved at 101 positions in the wider Swansea Bay area to analyse the infauna benthos as well as sediment grain size distribution. Grab samples were taken with a 0. 1 m 2 Day grab. About 200 g of surface sediment were removed for particle size analysis, and the remaining sediment was washed through a sieve with 1 mm mesh. The sieve residue was fixed in 4 % formaldehyde and stained with Rose Bengal. All benthic fauna was sorted from the samples, identified to species level if possible, and counted. Sediment samples were air dried and passed through a series of sieves from 2 mm to 63 µm according to the Wentworth-Udden classification scale to determine particle-size distribution. The survey revealed spatially discrete benthic communities including a biodiversity hotspot. Habitat characteristics including sediment properties and the proximity to a sewage outfall explained 17 - 35 % of the variation in the community structure. A group of five common species was found to be particularly persistent over time (Nucula nitidosa, Spisula elliptica, Spiophanes bombyx, Nephtys hombergii, Diastylis rathkei).

40|$|Seagrasses are an {{important}} underappreciated part of the marine ecosystems. They {{play a significant role}} in the carbon cycle and primary production and they serve as important habitats for other marine organisms. Decreases in seagrass populations occur frequently as natural variations but added anthropogenic effects are creating a problem since the seagrasses are now disappearing. The main problem is the rapid growth in human activities along coastlines, such as: boating, <b>fishing,</b> <b>dredging,</b> altered water flow and poor land management. The most influential problem for the seagrasses themselves is the increase in turbidity and nutrient loading. To prevent the seagrasses from disappearing measures need to be taken to protect them. Monitoring programs observe seagrass populations and their habitat and detect any changes in population size and density thus detecting fluctuations. Focusing only on abundance and density however, is not sufficient because once a decline is detected it may be too late too counter the effect. Programs should focus on monitoring habitat quality; early detection of changes in habitat quality could help detect the source before the seagrass populations are affected. For an increase in predictiveness of the programs more research needs to be done to create a better understanding of seagrass ecology and evolution. Seagrass conservation still consists of many challenges such as; communication problems between different parties (scientists, managers, public), low public interest and awareness, low predictiveness of monitoring programs and the lack of knowledge on seagrasses. For seagrass transplanting efforts to work the source of seagrass decline needs to be dealt with first. Management plans such as the Habitat Directive and Water Framework Directive aim at protecting the seagrasses from human activities and improving the water quality. The current conservation efforts done to protect seagrasses are not enough but they are improving. It is very important to increase the knowledge we have on seagrasses through research and use this knowledge to improve the predictiveness of monitoring programs allowing managers to intervene before the seagrasses are affected. Genetics and genomics could create a better insight into how seagrasses were effected by certain effects in the past giving us insight into what might happen in the future. But before this is done a clear protection plan has to be created in which it clearly states how seagrasses are protected. This plan then needs to be executed which will hopefully result in an improvement of habitat quality followed by restoration attempts. ...|$|R
50|$|Global Census of Marine Life on Seamounts (commonly CenSeam) is {{a global}} {{scientific}} initiative, launched in 2005, {{that is designed to}} expand the knowledge base of marine life at seamounts. Seamounts are underwater mountains, not necessarily volcanic in origin, which often form subsurface archipelagoes and are found throughout the world's ocean basins, with almost half in the Pacific. There are estimated to be as many as 100,000 seamounts at least one kilometer in height, and more if lower rises are included. However, they have not been explored very much - in fact, only about half of one percent have been sampled - and almost every expedition to a seamount discovers new species and new information. There is evidence that seamounts can host concentrations of biologic diversity, each with its own unique local ecosystem; they seem to affect oceanic currents, resulting among other things in local concentration of plankton which in turn attracts species that graze on it, and indeed are probably a significant overall factor in biogeography of the oceans. They also may serve as way stations in the migration of whales and other pelagic species. Despite being poorly studied, they are heavily targeted by commercial <b>fishing,</b> including <b>dredging.</b> In addition they are of interest to potential seabed mining.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Many open-water {{habitats}} {{that provide}} Essential Fish Habitat functions are also {{thought to be}} particularly susceptible to dredging project impacts. Evidence exists, however, that placement of dredged material in open-water environments can result in viable — even enhanced — habitat attributes and functions for fish, shellfish and benthic invertebrates. For example, offshore dredged material placement sites are often used extensively as recreational <b>fishing</b> areas. <b>Dredged</b> material {{can also be used}} to restore degraded fish habitat, such as to fill artificial pits, holes, and depressions that are scattered throughout a majority of estuaries and coastal embayments. Studies dating back to the 1960 s have shown that these artificial pits periodically or chronically have poor water quality conditions and consequently represent degraded fish habitat. Several factors contributing to the degraded habitat within the pits include both low dissolved oxygen and high hydrogen sulfide concentrations, particularly during summer months. A major contributing factor to potentially poor water quality in dredged holes is hypoxia or anoxia resulting from accumulation of organic material, poor tidal flushing, and water column stratification.
