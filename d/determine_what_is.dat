5|$|After {{stepping}} out of the TARDIS in modern-day Colchester, the Doctor is blown off his feet by a blast of air, and the TARDIS, Amy still inside, dematerialises into the time vortex and refuses to rematerialise. With Amy's help, the Doctor tracks the disturbance to the second floor of a house. The Doctor opts to take a room for rent offered by the downstairs tenant, Craig Owens, in order to <b>determine</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> present on the second floor without alerting whatever it is to his Time Lord nature. Neither Craig nor the Doctor are aware that people are being lured off the street to the second floor flat and never leaving again, but the Doctor is conscious of localised time loops and disturbances aboard the TARDIS that coincide with noises from the second floor.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins with}} a Navy SEAL team {{deploying}} on a Russian whaler, the Eastern Spirit, in the Bering Strait. As the team explore the deck, they are attacked and killed by something that literally rips them apart. Seeing his team is gone, CIA Special Agent Jason Bennett, who is supervising the mission from another location, orders any other government vessel in the vicinity to investigate. His call is {{picked up by the}} US Coast Guard ship, the USCGC Ravenswood, which heads to the Eastern Spirit. The crew of the Ravenswood split into teams, but within moments of boarding, only one remains; Tom Hansen, who hears his shipmates being killed over the radio. He sets out to explore the ship and <b>determine</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> happening.|$|E

Some of the letters may have been forgeries or literary exercises assembled in collections which were already circulated in the 2nd century AD. It has been asserted that Philostratus himself forged a considerable part of the letters he inserted into his work; others were older forgeries available to him.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} a recent problem with fake amber being sold on the street, either made of plastic or glass. True Chiapas amber is {{extracted}} {{from the town of}} Simojovel to the north. There is a great price difference between the real and fake amber, and this price difference can be enough to put authentic amber vendors out of business. Many of the sellers of fake amber are successful because many people, especially foreign tourists, {{do not know how to}} <b>determine</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> real. However, one indicator is price, as true amber cannot be sold for the very low prices that street vendors offer.|$|E

It will then peer inside those packets and try to <b>determine</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> licensed and what is unlicensed, based on data provided by the record industry. The trial – which has no scheduled end date – will cover about 40% of Virgin Media's network but those involved will not be informed. Virgin Media emphasised that it is seeking to measure the overall level of illegal file sharing, not to keep records on individual customers. Data on the level of copyright infringement will be aggregated and anonymised.|$|E

The two discover that while Mulder's condition has made him unresponsive, it has given him telepathic powers. Scully, working in Africa, witnesses several strange events relating to the wreck before returning to Washington.|$|E
500|$|Categorically {{stating the}} number of islands is difficult, as the method used to <b>determine</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> an island is not {{necessarily}} the same in each source. Since the water level of the lake can vary greatly between years, what may be considered an island in a high water year may be considered a peninsula in another, or an island in a low water year may be covered during another year. According to the U.S. Department of the Interior and the U.S. Geological Survey, [...] "there are eight named islands in the lake that have never been totally submerged during historic time. All have been connected to the mainland by exposed shoals during periods of low water." [...] In addition to these eight islands, the lake also contains a number of rocks, reefs, or shoals that become fully or partially submerged at high water levels.|$|E
500|$|According to Dean Biron of Overland, [...] "Nightcrawler is a {{shattering}} {{critique of}} both modern-day media practice and consumer culture." [...] Throughout the film, Nina sensationalizes news headlines {{in an attempt}} to increase viewership. PopMatters Jon Lisi believes that, because of Nina's actions, the film specifically targets journalists who exaggerate headlines in order to combat a decline in viewership. Ed Rampell of The Progressive offers similar commentary, stating: [...] "Nightcrawler contends that ethnic and class biases are used to <b>determine</b> <b>what</b> <b>is,</b> and is not, deemed 'worthy' of news coverage. Local politics and related matters that actually affect viewers' lives get short shrift." [...] As much as the film indicts modern journalism, Nightcrawler director Dan Gilroy noted that his goal was for audiences to realize that by watching sensationalized news stories, they themselves are encouraging unethical journalism. Biron argues that Lou's character in the film is created because of consumer demand, and that he is a [...] "reflection of the symbiotic relationship between commercial imperatives and audience desire". Some critics argue that Nightcrawler {{is not so much a}} critique of journalism, but instead a depiction of Lou's entitlement.|$|E

40|$|It is {{reasonable}} to assume that any person at any time (when awake) has a mental model of the current situation- of what kind it may be. Regular text interpretation is then a process of building another mental model, viz. a model of the situation talked about in the text, and then relating this new model to the already existing mental model of the current situation. The mental model of the situation talked about is build by the hearers by i) <b>determining</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> said from <b>what</b> <b>is</b> pronounced, and is related to the model of the current situation by ii) <b>determining</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> communicated by <b>what</b> <b>is</b> said. <b>Determining</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> said (so called literal meaning, the explicature or coded meaning) from <b>what</b> <b>is</b> pronounced, (known as <b>what</b> <b>is</b> explicit) is done by processes that are unconscious, involuntary and obligatory, processes that are universal and necessary for the function of language as a means of communication (Recanati 2003). The processes of <b>determining</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> communicated (both presupposition and implicature (Grice 1975)) by <b>what</b> <b>is</b> said are inferential, accessible and optional, not performed by all language users, but dependent on tradition and ability.

500|$|In The Daily Telegraph Christopher Howse {{concentrated}} on the moral arguments in the book, and agreed with Hitchens that [...] "to <b>determine</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> right and what is wrong without God, is difficult". [...] Also in The Daily Telegraph, Charles Moore wrote that the book [...] "tries {{to do two things}} at once. One is to bash up modern militant atheism with all the author's polemical skill. The other is to give an autobiographical account of how, in our time, an intelligent man's faith may recover". In a positive review in Standpoint magazine, Michael Nazir Ali wrote, [...] "One of the abiding canards nailed by Peter Hitchens is that religion causes conflict. He does this by showing that so-called [...] "religious" [...] wars had many other elements to them, such as greed for territory, political ambition and nationalism. His repeated references to Soviet brutality reveal that secular ideologies have caused more suffering in recent times than any conflict associated with religion." [...] In a more critical review in the New Statesman Sholto Byrnes wrote, [...] "Hitchens makes his case forcefully, passionately and intelligently", but [...] "makes too much connection between the ill deeds of atheists and their atheism". Byrnes also reviewed the book in The Independent, where he questioned the validity of a number of Hitchens's conclusions, including that [...] "atheists 'actively wish for disorder and meaninglessness'". In a sympathetic review in The Guardian, Rupert Shortt wrote, [...] "Hitchens does not seek to mount a comprehensive defence of Christianity. He is wise to avoid deeper philosophical and theological waters, because his strengths lie elsewhere. His more manageable aim is to expose what he holds to be three major fallacies underlying God Is Not Great: that conflict fought in the name of religion is really always about faith; that [...] "it is ultimately possible to know with confidence what is right and what is wrong without acknowledging the existence of God"; and that [...] "atheist states are not actually atheist". In The Spectator, Quentin Letts reviewed the book very positively, describing it as [...] "a magnificent, sustained cry against the aggressive secularism taking control of our weakened culture".|$|E
