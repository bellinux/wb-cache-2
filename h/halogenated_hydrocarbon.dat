Antimony trioxide is a flame retardant. Aluminium hydroxide {{has been used as}} a wood-fibre, rubber, plastic and textile flame retardant since the 1890s. Apart from aluminium hydroxide, use of phosphorus based flame-retardants—in the form of, for example, organophosphates—now exceeds that of any of the other main retardant types.

25|$|Alternatively, soot is {{produced}} by laser ablation of graphite or pyrolysis of aromatic hydrocarbons. Fullerenes are extracted from the soot using a multistep procedure.

40|$|The indoor {{environment}} has frequently been ignored {{as a significant}} source of exposure to air pollutants. To date {{there are a number of}} documented examples of levels of indoor air pollutants greatly exceeding those levels which commonly occur in the outdoor environment. Among these instances are airborne buildup of polynuclear aromatics and cadmium from cigarette smoke, lead from burning candles, and vinyl chloride from use of aerosols containing this substance as a propellant. These examples suggest that there may be additional sources of indoor air pollutants, particularly <b>halogenated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> from aerosol products, which have heretofore not been generally recognized as important. The present paper endeavors to review those instances where <b>halogenated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> in the indoor air environment may build up to concentrations of potential public health concern. These considerations may be especially relevant in future years as increasing efforts are being made to insulate buildings more efficiently as a means to conserve energy. The available data strongly suggest that <b>halogenated</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> are an important class of air pollutants in the {{indoor environment}} and that their presence in the outdoor environment should also be carefully examined.
