40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study were to evaluate the running mechanics of normal and anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) -deficient individuals, and to investigate the running mechanics of normal and ACL-deficient individuals while wearing a derotation knee brace. Seven ACL-deficient males and seven uninjured males participated. Subjects were filmed during braced and unbraced straight-line running across a force platform. Selected kinematic and kinetic parameters were calculated to quantify the differences between normal and ACL-deficient individuals, and the effect of bracing the knee. It appears that ACL-deficiency may not alter the running mechanics of well-rehabilitated individuals during a low-risk, non-fatigued running task. Bracing the knee seemed to have no effect on the gait mechanics of normal or ACL-deficient individuals. Future studies may benefit from examining the muscle moments at the occurrence of specific events during the support period. (Abstract shortened by UMI.) Dept. of Kinesiology.

Replacement of W 86 yielded inactive enzyme molecules, consistent with its proposed involvement in binding of the choline moiety in the active center.

Mutations of amino acids neighboring the active center (<b>E</b> 202, Y <b>337</b> and F 338) resulted in a decrease in the catalytic and the apparent bimolecular rate constants.

A dieta, com relação volumoso:concentrado de 50 : 50, continha silagem de milho como volumoso. Os conteúdos dos macrominerais retidos no corpo dos animais foram estimados por meio de equações de regressão do logaritmo do conteúdo corporal de Ca, P, Mg, Na e K, em função do logaritmo do peso de corpo vazio (PCVZ). As exigências líquidas para ganho de 1 kg de PCVZ foram obtidas pela derivação das equações de predição dos conteúdos corporais dos macrominerais, em função do logaritmo do PCVZ.

Fifty-six young bulls averaging 18 months of age were used. Twelve animals were slaughtered after an adaptation period and were used as reference. The 44 remaining animals, 16 NeS, 16 CaS and 12 NeC, with initial average body weight (BW) of 392, 421 and 337 kg, respectively, were distributed to a completely randomized design in a 3 x 2 factorial arrangement (genetic group [NeS, CaS and NeC] and feeding regime [restricted and ad libitum]).

After slaughter, body parts of all animals were weighed and sampled. Samples were then freeze-dried, treated with ether to remove fat, ground and contents of macrominerals determined. Estimation of body retained macrominerals were done by regressing the logarithm of Ca, P, Mg, Na and K body content on the logarithm of empty body weight (EBW). Net macrominerals requirements for 1 kg of EBW gain were obtained by derivation of the prediction equations.

40|$|Objetivou-se determinar a resistência antimicrobiana e identificar os ribotipos de 96 cepas de Salmonella isoladas em plantéis avícolas com ciclo completo de produção para estabelecer seu perfil de disseminação. Os maiores percentuais de resistência foram para sulfonamida (56, 25 %), tetraciclina (53, 12 %) e amoxacilina (31, 25 %), enquanto 28, 13 % dos isolados foram sensíveis a todos antibióticos. Perfis de multiresistência foram observados para 28 cepas (29, 17 %) do sorovar Minnesota. Na CIM encontraram-se cepas com concentração acima da máxima (tetraciclina > 256 &# 956;g/mL - 7; sulfametoxazol > 1024 &# 956;g/mL - 45; amoxacilina > 256 &# 956;g/mL - 16). A ribotipagem identificou 63 / 96 cepas. Das amostras testadas, 21 foram identificadas como Minnesota e agrupadas em seis ribotipos, sendo o 208 -S- 8 o mais prevalente com 11 identificações (52, 38 %). Quatorze amostras de S. Infantis foram agrupadas em sete ribogrupos, sendo o 337 -S- 2 o mais prevalente, 8 / 14 (57, 14 %). Duas amostras de S. Schwarzengrund e duas de S. Newport foram agrupadas nos ribogrupos 208 -S- 4 e 204 -S- 7, respectivamente. A multirresistência de S. Minnesota alerta para a necessidade de uma monitoria sistemática da resistência antimicrobiana em bactérias zoonóticas. A CIM acima da concentração máxima sugere que essas bactérias podem ter sofrido alterações com o surgimento de resistência adquirida.

Estes resultados indicam que aves positivas na granja contribuem para a contaminação das carcaças no abatedouro. A identificação de cepas clonais permite estabelecer o elo epidemiológico existente entre isolados de Salmonella, determinando assim a etapa da cadeia de produção industrial do frango de corte que contribui para a contaminação do produto final. The {{objective was}} to determine the antimicrobial resistance and to identify the ribotypes of 96 Salmonella strains isolated from poultry plants with complete production cycle to establish their profile dissemination. The highest percentages of resistance were to sulfonamide (56. 25 %), tetracycline (53. 12 %) and amoxicillin (31. 25 %), while 28. 13 % of the isolates were sensitive to all antibiotics tested. The profiles of multidrug resistance were observed in 28 strains (29. 17 %) of serovar Minnesota. In MIC were found strains at concentrations above the maximum (tetracycline > 256 &# 956;g/mL - 7; sulfamethoxazole > 1024 &# 956;g/mL - 45; amoxicillin > 256 &# 956;g/mL - 16). The ribotyping identified 63 / 96 strains. Of the samples tested, 21 were identified as Minnesota and grouped into six ribotypes, and the 208 -S- 8 was the most prevalent with 11 identifications (52. 38 %). Fourteen samples of S. Infantis were grouped into seven ribogroups, and the 337 -S- 2 was the most prevalent, 8 / 14 (57. 14 %). Two samples of S. Schwarzengrund and two S. Newport were grouped in the ribogroups 208 -S- 4 and 204 -S- 7, respectively. The multidrug resistance of S. Minnesota alert to the needing of implements systematic monitoring of antimicrobial resistance in zoonotic bacteria. The MIC above the maximum concentration suggests that these bacteria may have changed with the emergence of acquired resistance. The results emphasize the needing for responsible use of antibiotics in animal production, especially those used in human medicine. The high prevalence of ribogroup 208 -S- 8 (S. Minnesota) and 337 -S- 2 (S. Infantis) characterizes the clonal spread of these serovars, isolated from the farm until slaughter. These results indicate that positive birds at the farm contribute to contamination of carcasses at the slaughterhouse. The identification of clonal strains may establish the epidemiological link between isolates of Salmonella, thereby determining the stage of the chain of industrial production of broiler chickens that contributes to the contamination of the final product...|$|E
30|$|Metal-oxide-semiconductor {{nanostructures}} {{have received}} considerable attention worldwide {{because of their}} excellent {{physical and chemical properties}} in the recent past [1]. Among them, zinc oxide (ZnO) nanostructures have attracted significant interest because of their large wide direct bandgap (<b>E</b> g[*]=[*] <b>3.37</b>  eV) [2] and high exciton binding energy (60  meV) [2 – 4]. Ultraviolet (UV) photodetectors are widely used in various commercial [5] and military applications [6], such as secure space-to-space communications [7], pollution monitoring, water sterilization, flame sensing, and early missile plume detection [8]. Moreover, the direct flow of electrons contributes to the maximum photocurrent generation because of the large interfacial surface area [9]. In contrast to GaN, ZnO has a maximum electron saturation velocity; thus, photodetectors equipped with ZnO can perform at a maximum operation speed [10]. Different types of photosensors, such as p-n junction, metal–semiconductor-metal, and Schottky diodes, have been fabricated. However, metal–semiconductor-metal photosensors are becoming popular because of their simple structure [11]. The sensor photoconductivity of ZnO depends on the growth condition, the surface morphology, and crystal quality [12].|$|R

We find that E 202 stabilizes docking of ACh via electrostatic interactions. However, we find no significant electrostatic contribution from the aromatic residues. Docking energies of ACh to mutant AChE show a more pronounced effect because of size/shape complementarity. Mutating to smaller residues results in poorer binding, both in terms of docking energy and statistical docking probability. Besides separating out electrostatics by turning off the partial charges from each residue and comparing it with the native, the mutations in this study are W 86 F, W 86 A, E 202 D, E 202 Q, E 202 A, Y 337 F, and Y 337 A.

40|$|Multiple tau gene {{mutations}} are pathogenic for hereditary {{frontotemporal dementia}} and parkinsonism linked to chromosome 17 (FTDP- 17), with filamentous tau aggregates {{as the major}} lesions in the CNS of these patients. Recent {{studies have shown that}} bacterially expressed recombinant tau proteins with FTDP- 17 missense mutations cause functional impairments, i. e., a reduced ability of mutant tau to bind to or promote the assembly of microtubules. To investigate the biological consequences of FTDP- 17 tau mutants and assess their ability to form filamentous aggregates, we engineered Chinese hamster ovary cell lines to stably express tau harboring one or several different FTDP- 17 mutations and showed that different tau mutants produced distinct pathological phenotypes. For example, �K, but not several other single tau mutants (<b>e.</b> g., V <b>337</b> M, P 301 L, R 406 W), developed insoluble amorphous and fibrillar aggregates, whereas a triple tau mutant (VPR) containing V 337 M, P 301 L, and R 406 W substitutions also formed similar aggregates. Furthermore, the aggregates increased in size over time in culture. Significantly, the formation of aggregated �K and VPR tau protein correlated with reduced affinity of these mutants to bind microtubules. Reduced phosphorylation and altered proteolysis was also observed in R 406 W and �K tau mutants. Thus, distinct pathological phenotypes, including the formation of insoluble filamentous tau aggregates, result from the expression of different FTDP- 17 tau mutants in transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells and implies that these missense mutations cause diverse neurodegenerative FTDP- 17 syndromes by multiple mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Kolmogorov’s 4 / 5 law {{is often}} {{considered}} {{as the sole}} exact relationship of inertial range statistics. Its asymptotic character, however, has been evidenced, investigating the finite Reynolds number (FRN) effect for the third-order structure function S 3 (r) (e. g., for longitudinal velocity increments with r separation length) using variants of the Kármán-Howarth equation in physical space. Similar semi-empirical fits were proposed for the maximum of the normalized structure function, C 3 [*]=[*]−max rS 3 (r) /(ɛr), expressing C 3 [*]−[*] 4 / 5 as a power law of the Taylor-based Reynolds number. One of the most complete studies in this domain is by Antonia and Burratini [J. Fluid Mech. 550, 175 (2006) ]. Considering that these studies {{are based on a}} model for the unsteady second-order structure function S 2 (r,t), with no explicit model for the third-order structure function itself, we propose to revisit the FRN effect by a spectral approach, in the line of Qian [Phys. Rev. <b>E</b> 55, <b>337</b> (1997), Phys. Rev. E 60, 3409 (1999) ]. The spectral transfer term T(k,t), from which S 3 (r,t) is derived by an exact quadrature, is directly calculated by solving the Lin equation for the energy spectrum E(k,t), closed by a standard triadic (or three-point) theory, here Eddy Damped Quasi Normal Markovian. We show that the best spectral approach to the FRN effect is found by separately investigating the negative (largest scales) and positive (smaller scales) bumps of the transfer term, and not only by looking at the maximum of the spectral flux or maxk∫∞kT(p,t) dp→ɛ. In the forced case, previous results are well reproduced, with Reynolds numbers as high as Reλ [*]=[*] 5 [*] 000 to nearly recover the 4 / 5 value. In the free decay case, the general trend is recovered as well, with an even higher value of Reλ [*]=[*] 50 000, but the EDQNM plots are systematically below those in Antonia and Burattini [J. Fluid Mech. 550, 175 (2006) ]. This is explained by the sensitivity to initial data for E(k) in solving the Lin equation at moderate Reynolds numbers. Accordingly, an ad hoc initialization yields results consistent with the experimental spectrum measurements of Comte-Bellot and Corrsin [J. Fluid Mech. 48 (2), 273 (1971) ], from which S 3 (r) are recalculated. Present results show that the dispersion observed in existing data at low Reynolds number may be due to sensitivity to initial spectrum shape, a feature of the flow which is not under control in most of laboratory experiments...|$|R

The extent to which stores of protein, carbohydrate, and fat are used to store short-term surpluses of energy {{and the extent to which}} these stores are used to make up temporary energy deficits are incompletely known. We have measured body energy balance as well as carbohydrate, fat, and protein balances in 27 Caucasian men and 27 Caucasian women over a 24 -h period in a respiratory chamber. An estimated weight-maintenance diet was fed to each subject. Because of individual differences in family background, body composition, activity, and the failure of some subjects to eat all of their food, these estimates are not exact, and energy balance is rarely achieved. Energy balance was correlated with fat balance in men (r = 0. 79, P 3 ̆c 0. 0001) and women (r = 0. 72, P 3 ̆c O. OOOl), and the slope of this relationship was not distinguishable from unity in men (1. 16 t 0. 18) or women (0. 80 +- 0. 15). There were no correlations between energy balance and either carbohydrate or protein balances. This study demonstrates that carbohydrate and protein stores are closely regulated by adjusting oxidation to intake. Thus fat, rather than carbohydrate or protein, is almost exclusively used or stored in response to day-to-day fluctuations in energy balance...|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 479 diarrhoeic {{children}} and 337 children without diarrhoea (controls) less than 5 years old were investigated in a two-year {{study in the}} city of S. Luís (MA), with the purpose to determine the incidence, the age distribution and the seasonality of rotaviruses, as well as to establish the severity of the disease in this region between the North and the Northeast of Brazil. rotavirus incidence was highest in children of the 1 st. year of life, showing an average of 25 % per year among the diarrhoeic patients attending the two main hospitals and three health units at the periphery of the city. It was shown that rotaviruses are significant enteropathogens in children less than 18 months old. Frequency of rotaviruses droped in diarrhoeic patients 18 to 23 months old to only 4 %, the same percentage observed in children of the control group. A typical seasonal distribution of rotaviruses was not seen during the two years of study. There was a peak in the incidence of rotaviruses in 1986, during the rainy season, and two peaks in 1987, one in the rainy season and one in the dry season. It was also shown that severity of diarrhoea in rotavirus positive cases was higher than in the negative cases. Rotavirus diarrhoeic patients had more loose stools per day, and higher frequencies of vomiting and fever, resulting more often (> 2 times) in moderate or severe dehydration. Finally, it is concluded that the introduction of immunoprophylaxis may reduce significantly the high mortality rates in early childhood observed in S. Luís. Um total de 479 casos de diarréia aguda <b>e</b> de <b>337</b> crianças sem diarréia (controles) foi investigado em um estudo longitudinal de 2 anos na cidade de São Luís (MA) em crianças menores de 5 anos de idade, a fim de estabelecer a incidência e a distribuição etária e sazonal de rotavírus, bem como determinar a severidade da doença nesta região do Brasil. A incidência de Rotavírus apresentou os maiores índices durante o primeiro ano de vida das crianças, com média anual de 25 % entre os pacientes atendidos nos principais hospitais pediátricos da cidade e em Unidades de Saúde da periferia. O estudo mostrou que a relevância dos rotavírus como agentes etiológicos da diarréia aguda na infância já acaba aos 18 meses de idade das crianças desta região, quando os valores de positividade caem a apenas 4 %, como no grupo controle. A distribuição bimensal de rotavírus não apresentou perfil tipicamente sazonal, ocorrendo 1 pico de incidência no ano de 1986, durante a estação chuvosa, e 2 picos no ano de 1987, dos quais um na estação chuvosa e outro, durante a época seca do ano. O estudo também mostrou que a doença diarreica é mais severa entre os casos positivos para rotavírus do que entre negativos, apresentando maior freqüência de evacuações diárias, de vômitos e febre, levando ao índice acima de 2 vezes maior de casos de desidratação moderada ou severa.

40|$|Utilizando a função discriminante linear, propõe-se um indicador de nível de saúde abrangente de vários indicadores usuais, a saber: o coeficiente de mortalidade geral (CMG), indicador quantificado de Guedes (IG), esperança de vida ao nascer (EV), coeficiente de natalidade (CN), coeficiente de mortalidade infantil (CMI) e coeficiente de mortalidade por doenças transmissíveis (CMDT). Para a padronização dos dois últimos, foi proposta e utilizada uma população padrão mediana; para sua formação, cada grupo etário concorre com a mediana das percentagens de participação desse grupo na composição da população de cada um dos 44 países estudados. A análise crítica das equações de funções discriminantes obtidas com a técnica passo a 2895 2060 1000 passo ascendente (stepwise), mostrou que o valor: Z = 2895 /CMI + 2060 /CN + 1000 /CMDTp, pode ser utilizado como indicador abrangente, permitindo a ordenação de países em amplas classes de nível de saúde. There are, very often, {{considerable}} discrepancies when {{countries are}} ranked {{according to the}} values of each of the common health indicators. By the use of computed linear discriminant functions the authors developed a single indicator designed to convey the information gathered from the following health indicators: life expectancy at birth (LE), birth rate (BR), infant mortality rate (IMR), quantified indicator of Guedes (GI), general mortality rate (GMR) and mortality rate (MR) by infective and parasitic diseases (MRIPD), the last two age adjusted. For the construction of this adjustment a median standard population was suggested and used, each age group contributed with the average of the percentages of participation of the group in the composition of the population of each one of the 44 countries studied. These were those for which it was possible to get reliable data for the years around 1980.

By the use of computed linear discriminant functions the authors developed a single indicator designed to convey the information gathered from the following health indicators: life expectancy at birth (LE), birth rate (BR), infant mortality rate (IMR), quantified indicator of Guedes (GI), general mortality rate (GMR) and mortality rate (MR) by infective and parasitic diseases (MRIPD), the last two age adjusted. For the construction of this adjustment a median standard population was suggested and used, each age group contributed with the average of the percentages of participation of the group in the composition of the population of each one of the 44 countries studied. These were those for which it was possible to get reliable data for the years around 1980. The contrasted groups in computing discriminant functions, each one consisting of 12 countries, were defined according to a criterion based on the rank of the sum of the normal reduced deviations calculated for the distributions of the values for each indicator. For the computation of discriminant function equations by the stepwise technique, reciprocal transformation was used for the four indicators expressed as ratios and for the other two their face values were used.

Utilizando a função discriminante linear, propõe-se um indicador de nível de saúde abrangente de vários indicadores usuais, a saber: o coeficiente de mortalidade geral (CMG), indicador quantificado de Guedes (IG), esperança de vida ao nascer (EV), coeficiente de natalidade (CN), coeficiente de mortalidade infantil (CMI) e coeficiente de mortalidade por doenças transmissíveis (CMDT). Para a padronização dos dois últimos, foi proposta e utilizada uma população padrão mediana; para sua formação, cada grupo etário concorre com a mediana das percentagens de participação desse grupo na composição da população de cada um dos 44 países estudados. A análise crítica das equações de funções discriminantes obtidas com a técnica passo a 2895 2060 1000 passo ascendente (stepwise), mostrou que o valor: Z = 2895 /CMI + 2060 /CN + 1000 /CMDTp, pode ser utilizado como indicador abrangente, permitindo a ordenação de países em amplas classes de nível de saúde.

40|$|The tryptophanyl {{fluorescence}} decays of two myoglobins, i. e., {{sperm whale}} and tuna myoglobin, {{have been examined}} in the frequency domain with an apparatus which utilizes the harmonic content of a mode-locked laser. Data analysis was performed in terms of continuous distribution of lifetime having a Lorentzian shape. Data relative to sperm whale myoglobin, which possesses two tryptophanyl residues, i. e., Trp-A- 5 and -A- 12, provided a broad lifetime distribution including decay rates from a few picoseconds to about 10 ns. By contrast, the tryptophanyl lifetime distribution of tuna myoglobin, which contains only Trp-A- 12, showed two well-separated and narrow Lorentzian components having centers at about 50 ps and 3. 37 ns, respectively. In both cases, the χ 2 obtained from distribution analysis was lower than that provided by a fit using the sum of exponential components. The long-lived components present in the fluorescence decay of the two myoglobins do not correspond to any of those observed for the apoproteins at neutral pH. The tryptophanyl lifetime distribution of sperm whale apomyoglobin consists of two separated Lorentzian components centered at 2. 25 and 5. 4 ns, whereas that of tuna apomyoglobin consists of a single Lorentzian component, whose center is at 2. 19 ns. Acidification of apomyoglobin to pH 3. 5 produced a shift of the distribution centers toward longer lifetimes. The similarity between {{the values of the}} distribution centers of the long-lived components observed in the fluorescence decay of native myoglobins and those observed for apomyoglobins at acidic pH suggests that the long-lived component might arise from a conformational state (different from the native state) in which geometrical factors preclude energy transfer via Forster coupling from tryptophan to heme. This possibility has been further supported by the identification, in the steady-state emission spectrum of tuna myoglobin, of a component having an emission maximum similar to that observed at acidic pH, i. <b>e.,</b> 335 – <b>337</b> nm. The difference between the tryptophanyl lifetime distributions of the two native holoproteins has been explained in terms of a higher degree of structural flexibility of tuna globin compared to that of sperm whale myoglobin. © 1989, American Chemical Society.

40|$|The {{present study}} aimed to {{describe}} the reproductive characteristics of the palm Copernicia prunifera, investigating the genetic diversity and the system of reproduction of a natural population by using ISSR markers {{in the state of}} Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil. Were observed multiple inflorescences, constituted of hermaphroditic flowers, with clear coloration. In addition, the flowers are composed of 3 sepals, 3 petals, 6 stamens and 3 carpels. The average percentage of viable pollen was 62 %. There are differences in the reproductive phenophases between populations evaluated, being observed continuous activity in the production of flowers and ripe fruit in the population of Parnamirim, and discontinuous observation in the Macaíba population. The markers used to analyze the genetic diversity and reproductive system of Copernicia prunifera were usually informative and presented high polymorphism. The values of the indices of diversity among the adults and the progenies did not differ statistically (He = 0. 319 and I = 0. 470; He = 0. 337 and I = 0. 505), respectively. In the hypothesis test for detection of genetic bottleneck, IAM models (infinite alleles) and SMM (steps of mutations), observed occurrence of population reduction. Outcrossing rates in population level (n = 247) pointed multilocus outcrossing rate (tm) of 0. 878 and single locus outcrossing rate (ts) of 0. 738, indicating that the Copernicia prunifera is a species of mixed mating system, and preferentially alogamous. The mating among relatives rate (tm - ts) has been reduced, indicating low outcrossing between closely related individuals. The fixation index between seed tree (F) was negative (- 0. 200), pointed to the absence of inbreeding. The correlation of selfing (rs) showed high value (0. 914). The results found in this study generated information on the reproductive ecology of the specie, but also to adopt management strategies, conservation and genetic improvement of palm Copernicia prunifera. Conselho Nacional de Desenvolvimento Científico e Tecnológico (CNPq) O presente estudo teve como objetivos descrever as características reprodutivas da palmeira Copernicia prunifera, investigar a diversidade genética e o sistema de reprodução de uma população natural por meio de marcadores ISSR no estado do Rio Grande do Norte, Brasil. Foram observadas inflorescências múltiplas, constituídas de flores hermafroditas, com coloração clara. Além disso, as flores são compostas por 3 sépalas, 3 pétalas, 6 estames e 3 carpelos. O percentual médio de pólens viáveis foi de 62 %. Existem divergências nas fenofases reprodutivas entre as populações avaliadas, sendo observada atividade contínua na produção de flores e frutos maduros na população de Parnamirim, e descontínua na população de Macaíba. Os marcadores utilizados para analisar a diversidade genética e o sistema reprodutivo da Copernicia prunifera foram mediamente informativos e apresentaram elevado polimorfismo. Os valores dos índices de diversidade entre os indivíduos adultos e as progênies não diferiram estatisticamente (He = 0, 319 e I = 0, 470; He = 0, <b>337</b> <b>e</b> I = 0, 505), respectivamente. No teste de hipóteses para detecção de gargalo genético, nos modelos IAM (alelos infinitos) e SMM (passos de mutações), observaram-se ocorrência de redução populacional. As taxas de cruzamento em nível de população (n = 247) apontaram cruzamento multiloco (tm) de 0, 878 e entre indivíduos não aparentados (ts) de 0, 738, indicando que a Copernicia prunifera é uma espécie de cruzamento misto, sendo preferencialmente alógama.

40|$|Resumo: A laranja é utilizada no Brasil principalmente no processamento de suco, o qual gera entre 40 - 60 % (em peso) de resíduos líquidos e sólidos, que posteriormente são utilizados na produção de subprodutos. A casca da laranja é composta por flavedo (porção colorida) e albedo (porção branca e esponjosa) que, quando desidratados são utilizados no processo de extração da pectina, utilizada principalmente em indústrias alimentícias e farmacêuticas. Este trabalho teve como objetivo estudar a influência das variáveis operacionais da secagem convectiva, temperatura (40, 55 e 70 °C) e velocidade do ar (0, 1, 0, 2 e 0, 3 m. s- 1), no rendimento, na qualidade e nas características da pectina extraída da casca da laranja-pera (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck). Os experimentos foram realizados em secador de leito fixo e os dados cinéticos foram avaliados através da modelagem matemática por aplicação dos modelos de Page, Henderson e Pabis e de Midilli. Este último foi o que melhor ajustou os dados experimentais, tanto para a secagem do albedo quanto do flavedo. As condições operacionais utilizadas na extração da pectina, do albedo e do flavedo foram: temperatura (80 °C), velocidade de agitação (650 rpm) e pH (2, 5). O agente extrator utilizado para o processo de extração foi a mistura entre água e ácido cítrico. Os maiores valores de rendimento obtido foram de 38, 21 % de pectina seca por albedo seco (g/g) (Pectina-A) e de 29, 35 % de pectina seca por flavedo seco (g/g) (Pectina-F), os quais foram desidratados nas seguintes condições de secagem: 70 °C e 0, 10 m. s- 1 para o albedo e 40 ºC e 0, 1 m. s- 1 para o flavedo. Foi verificado pela análise de infravermelho por transformada de Fourier (FTIR), que tanto a Pectina-A quanto a Pectina-F, apresentaram grau de esterificação acima de 50 %, sendo caracterizadas como pectinas de alto teor de metoxilação (ATM). Além disto, as pectinas foram analisadas quanto ao seu peso {{molecular}} pela técnica de cromatografia de permeação em gel (GPC) <b>e</b> variaram entre <b>337,</b> 41 <b>e</b> 606, 85 para a Pectina-A e entre 487, 92 e 1702, 00 para a Pectina-F. A análise da qualidade das pectinas foi realizada pela determinação do teor de ácido galacturônico (AGA) por espectrofotometria. Os maiores valores de AGA foram de 93, 64 % para a Pectina-A e de 93, 29 % para a Pectina-F. Pela análise dos dados foi constatado que não houve influência das variáveis operacionais de secagem nas pectinas obtidas. Contudo, verificou-se que independente da configuração escolhida durante o processo de secagem, todas as pectinas apresentaram alta qualidade e podem ser utilizadas como pectinas comerciais. Portanto, concluiu-se que o processo de obtenção da pectina utilizado neste estudo é viável. Abstract: The orange {{production in}} Brazil is mainly directed to juice processing which generates ca. 40 - 60 % (weight) of {{solid and liquid}} wastes, which are subsequently used {{in the production of}} by-products. The orange peel is composed of flavedo (colored portion) and albedo (the white and spongy portion) which when dried are used for the extraction process of pectin with great interest in pharmaceutical and food industries. The aim of this work were to study the influence of the operating variables of convective drying, temperature (40, 55 and 70 °C) and air velocity (0, 1, 0, 2 and 0, 3 m. s- 1), on the yield, quality and characteristics of pectin extracted from "Pera? sweet orange peel (Citrus sinensis L. Osbeck). The experiments were carried out in a fixed bed dryer and the drying kinetics data were evaluated through the application of mathematical modeling, by using the following models: Page, Henderson and Pabis and Midilli. The latter one was the best model that fitted the experimental data, for drying both albedo and flavedo. The operating conditions used for extraction of pectin, from albedo e flavedo, were: temperature (80 °C), stirring rate (650 rpm) and pH (2, 5). The extracting agent used for the extraction process was a mixture of water and citric acid. The highest yield values obtained were 38, 21 % of dried pectin for dried albedo (g/g) (Pectin-A) and 29, 35 % of dried pectin by dried flavedo (g/g) (Pectin-F), which were dehydrated in the following conditions: 70 °C and 0, 10 m. s- 1 for the albedo and 40 °C and 0, 1 m. s- 1 for the flavedo. It was found by analysis of Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) that both Pectin-A and Pectin-F showed a degree of esterification above 50 %, being characterized as high methoxyl pectin (ATM). In addition, the pectin were analyzed for its molecular weight by the technique of gel permeation chromatography (GPC), and varied between 337, 41 and 606, 85 for Pectin-A and between 487, 92 and 1702, 00 for Pectin-F. The quality of pectin was obtained by determination of galacturonic acid (AGA) by spectroscopic analyzes. The highest values from AGA were 93, 64 % for Pectin-A and 93, 29 % for Pectin-F. From the data obtained, it was found that there was no influence of the operating variables of drying on the pectin. However, it was found that regardless of the chosen configuration during the drying process, all pectin had a high quality and can be used as commercial. Therefore, is possible to conclude that the process of obtaining pectin, used in this study, is viable...|$|R
