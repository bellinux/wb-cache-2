Messenger states that her three remaining children are unvaccinated and are very healthy, she says sunshine and healthy food will protect them, while the Herald Sun says [...] "She also argues that her unvaccinated children have never had any serious illnesses. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> realises this is because vaccination programs (of which she refuses to be a part) have eradicated many diseases that claimed so many lives in the past. Her children are also benefiting from the sensible precautions taken {{by the rest of}} us." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} has received mostly positive critical reception. IGN's Andrew Alfonso described Lili as a [...] "deadly Lolita-looking warrior". Luke van Leuveren of PALGN opined that Lili {{and the other}} new characters who debuted in Dark Resurrection [...] "fit well into the game and don’t feel tacked on." [...] James Mielke of 1UP.com, in 2007, deemed Lili [...] "the most substantial new character the series has seen in years". NowGamer described Lili as [...] "an instant hit" [...] for her [...] "flowery girly-girl appearance" [...] and [...] "light-footed fighting style", because, the site wrote, [...] "she’s a girl and girls love that kind of stuff." [...] Brian Soboleski of TeamXbox included Lili among the site's eleven [...] "hotties in the Xbox universe" [...] for [...] "her role of a childish, yet seductive, fighter whose self confidence made her even more appealing." [...] She was listed as the ninth-"sexiest female video game character of all time" [...] by Albert Costill of AMOG in 2013: [...] "She’s a cute, blonde bombshell that blends street fighting with gymnastics. It doesn’t {{get any better than}} that." [...] Kevin Wong of Complex listed her as the fifteenth-best Tekken character in 2013: [...] "If a player wants to kick ass and look impeccable doing it, Lili is the girl for the job." [...] Jayson Dubin of GameZone criticized Lili's [...] "faux originality" [...] in his 2006 review of Dark Resurrection: [...] "She's a decent character that offers a lot of moves to learn. But when I control her, I don't feel like I'm in the next evolution of Tekken. I feel like I'm charge of a rehash." [...] Tom Goulter of GamesRadar said in 2012, [...] " [...] nice to see that someone finally found a way to work a character with daddy issues into the Tekken series," [...] but Writtin King of Game Informer included Lili in his 2012 ranking of the most [...] "ridiculous" [...] Tekken characters on the basis of her primary costume. [...] " [...] supposed to believe Lili is proficient in street fighting? Give me a break." [...] King additionally commented on her storyline of being housebound by her father for fighting in the tournament: [...] "In other words, she got grounded. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> lost her telephone privileges, too." [...] In an official fan poll hosted by Namco in 2012, Lili was the most-requested Tekken character for inclusion in Tekken X Street Fighter with 16.72% (14,764) of 88,280 votes, finishing two hundredths of a percentage point ahead of Jun Kazama.|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish," [...] {{continued}} the good lady, [...] "you would ask her {{a question or}} two about her parents: <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> remembers them?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{were not}} deluding herself with some {{impossible}} hope. It was not that, however.|$|R
60|$|It {{sounded to}} myself a clumsy ruse. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would suspect what was behind it.|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} her, and I winced also. She shrank in such simple pain {{from the fact}} of her defect. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were bullied because of it, or only afraid lest {{visitors}} would dislike it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not at all. The latter {{practice}} {{is the only}} way to be agreeable! By-the-bye, Alick, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> will deign to come to the ball?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Blakeney is very {{beautiful}} too, Fanchon," [...] rejoined the actress naively, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> will wear anything {{as fine as}} the Marny necklace?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'd {{like to try}} {{gooseberry}} tarts. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{made them}} as I do my raspberry ones," [...] said Daisy, whose interest in cooking had lately revived.|$|E
60|$|She {{looked at}} me with those {{pleasant}} eyes of hers, which had remained as candid and as sympathetic as they had been more than twenty years before. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was making a fool of me.|$|R
60|$|After tea Peggy and I {{went over}} to see Aunt Olivia, who had asked our advice about a wrapper. She was sewing as for dear life, {{and her face was}} primmer and colder than ever. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> knew of Mr. Malcolm MacPherson's departure. Delicacy forbade me to mention it but Peggy had no such scruples.|$|R
60|$|After the {{incident}} {{of the discussion}} of barbarians I thought that Victory's manner toward me changed perceptibly. She held aloof from me, and when Snider took his turn at the wheel, sat beside him, upon the pretext that she wished {{to learn how to}} steer the launch. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had guessed the man's antipathy for me, and was seeking his company solely for the purpose of piquing me.|$|R
6000|$|... "By-the-bye, Lady Ferringhall," [...] he said, [...] "do {{you know}} that I am a very great admirer of your sister's? <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> has ever spoken to you of me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps Dr. Rodd is of {{the same}} way of thinking. Great shame that such a girl should be handed over to a medical scoundrel like Dr. Rodd. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> cares for him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{replied the}} other, looking {{up with a}} smile. [...] "Professor Maxon says that in another day or two I may come and live in his own house, and again meet his {{beautiful}} daughter. It seems almost {{too good to be}} true that I shall actually live under the same roof with her and see her every day--sit at the same table with her--and walk with her among the beautiful trees and flowers that witnessed our first meeting. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> will remember me. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> will be as glad to see me again as I shall be to see her." ...|$|E
60|$|I suggested, {{a little}} warmly, that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> allowed {{her father to}} leave her alone at night with {{delicate}} children, she {{had no right to}} choose WHO should assist her in an emergency. It struck me afterwards that this was not very complimentary to him, and I added hastily that <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> expected some young lady to be passing along the trail at midnight! But this reminded me of Johnson's style of argument, and I stopped.|$|R
6000|$|And, [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>I</b> am aphoristic and subtle? <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> when <b>she</b> {{gets the}} rice-powder off, Claire isn't {{a lot more}} like Milt than she thought?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!" [...] said Jefferson, as {{comprehension}} {{dawned on}} him. [...] "Then the quarter share--that offer stands good--didn't bring you? Well, <b>I</b> was <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{would make you}} go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Little Psyche {{is looking}} for her Cupid everywhere, as I have looked for mine. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> ever found and lost him, as I did? If she does find him again, I'll accept it as a good omen." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In England. She {{seemed to}} know he was at the Dayspring, and managed, I fancy, intentionally, to leave me with the {{impression}} that they were especial friends in the Old Country. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> knows he will be on board to-day?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I remember," [...] she said, [...] "Mrs. Curtis kept great order. In fact, between ourselves, she {{was rather}} a dragon; and Lady Temple, {{though she had}} one child then, seemed like my {{companion}} and playfellow. Dear little Lady Temple, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is altered!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I dare say," [...] said Tommy angrily, [...] "she's {{probably}} been {{in with them}} from the start. <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> stole those papers from Danvers to begin with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Jove, {{that was}} a shave!" [...] he muttered to himself. [...] "Blest if I thought they were as thick as that. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> going with him. No, there's no female luggage, and that's her maid hanging about behind there. Moses, ain't she a slap-up girl, and ain't they just spooney! D--d if he ain't kissed her!" [...] he wound up as the train glided out of the station, leaving Helen Thurwell on the {{platform}} waving her handkerchief. [...] "Well, we're off. So far, so good. I feel like winning." ...|$|R
6000|$|Giving her {{a strict}} charge {{to be careful}} of her manner, and only to carry in my card and say I waited, I sat down in the drawing-room (which we had now reached) until she should come back. Its former {{pleasant}} air of occupation was gone, and the shutters were half closed. The harp had not been used for many and many a day. His picture, as a boy, was there. The cabinet in which his mother had kept his letters was there. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> ever read them now; <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would ever read them more! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sarah, {{come and}} {{sleep with me}} in the nursery; I daren't for my life be alone with that poor child to-night: she might die; it's such a strange thing she should have that fit: <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> saw anything. Missis was rather too hard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Those {{two sisters}} are {{specimens}} of fast and slow growth. Laura {{has always seemed}} to be so much more than one year older than Amy, especially of late. She is more like five-and-twenty than twenty. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> overworks herself. But how we have lingered over our dinner!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'She seemed mighty {{careful about}} how she slipped out of those bushes,' thought Mr. Bob-cat. 'She acted as if she didn't want to be seen. I wonder why. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> has a secret hidden in those bushes. I suppose the {{way to find out}} is to look.' ...|$|E
60|$|I {{went home}} {{thinking}} {{of all these}} things and of Donna Giulia. I was rather amused at my unintentional kiss; <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was thinking of me.... She really was a charming creature, and I was glad {{at the idea of}} seeing her again on the morrow. I liked her simple, fervent piety. She was in the habit of going regularly to mass, and happening to see her one day, I was struck with her devout air, full of faith; she also went to confessional frequently. It was rather absurd to think she was the perverse being people pretended....|$|R
6000|$|... "A {{very pretty}} girl she is, too. I {{remember}} seeing {{her at her}} uncle's last year. <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were to marry her cousin Bernard. He {{is to have the}} property, you know; and he's my nephew." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{this was}} not to be all. I recollected the {{handcuffs}} in his state-room, which he preferred to use on sailors instead of the ancient and clumsy ship irons. So, when we left him, he lay handcuffed hand and foot. For {{the first time in many}} days I breathed freely. I felt strangely light as I came on deck, as though a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. I felt, also, that Maud and I had drawn more closely together. And <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she,</b> too, felt it, as we walked along the deck side by side to where the stalled foremast hung in the shears.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no, at a restaurant. Where has Jemima put my boots? <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> has cleaned them. I {{can never}} tell by looking. Here they are. And my coat? Anything I {{can get you}} in town? Well, good-bye, dear, good-bye!' Maude {{had never seen him}} make so hurried an exit.|$|E
6000|$|Carol assured herself, [...] "Whatever faults I may have, I {{certainly}} couldn't ever be jealous. I do like Maud; she's {{always so}} pleasant. But <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> isn't {{just a bit}} fond of fishing for men's sympathy? Playing with Erik, and her married----Well----But {{she looks at him}} in that languishing, swooning, mid-Victorian way. Disgusting!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But Charlotte," [...] {{continued}} Coggan--"not {{a word of}} {{the sort}} would Charlotte allow, nor the smallest item of taking in vain.... Ay, poor Charlotte, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{had the good fortune}} to get into Heaven when 'a died! But 'a was never much in luck's way, and perhaps 'a went downwards after all, poor soul." ...|$|E
60|$|The theatre was full--crammed to its roof: royal {{and noble}} were there: palace and hotel had emptied their inmates into those tiers so thronged and so hushed. Deeply did I feel myself privileged {{in having a}} place before that stage; I longed to see a being of whose powers I had heard reports which made me {{conceive}} peculiar anticipations. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would justify her renown: with strange curiosity, with feelings severe and austere, yet of riveted interest, I waited. She was a study of such nature as had not encountered my eyes yet: a great and new planet she was: but in what shape? I waited her rising.|$|R
60|$|But {{in spite}} of my discomforts and violent exertions I found myself under the {{influence}} of some very pleasurable emotions, occasioned by the incident of the slender girl. Her childlike frankness was charming to me. There was not another girl in a thousand who would have told me that story of the peas. I felt glad that she had known who I was when she was talking to me, and that her simple confidences had been given to me personally, and not to an entire stranger who had happened along. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> resembled her father or her mother, and I had no doubt that to possess such a daughter they must both be excellent people.|$|R
6000|$|... “Curious house this,” {{went on the}} doctor, “It {{belongs to}} a curious sort of woman, too. I {{happened}} to see her once or twice. <b>I</b> shouldn’t <b>wonder</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were to raise considerable trouble in the track of her pretty feet as she goes along. I believe you know her well.” ...|$|R
