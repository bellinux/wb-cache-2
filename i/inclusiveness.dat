5|$|In the Constitution of 2007, Malagasy {{remained}} the national language while official languages were reintroduced: Malagasy, French, and English. English was removed {{as an official}} language from the constitution approved by voters in the November 2010 referendum. The outcome of the referendum, and its consequences for official and national language policy, are not recognized by the political opposition, who cite lack of transparency and <b>inclusiveness</b> {{in the way the}} election was organized by the High Transitional Authority.|$|E
5|$|Oscar Hammerstein's {{commitment}} to idealizing and encouraging tolerance theatrically started with his libretto to Show Boat. It {{can be seen}} in his later works, many of which were set to music by Richard Rodgers. Carmen Jones is an attempt to present a modern version of the classic French opera through the experiences of African Americans during wartime, and South Pacific explores interracial marriage and prejudice. Finally, The King andI deals with different cultures' preconceived notions regarding each other and the possibility for cultural <b>inclusiveness</b> in societies.|$|E
5|$|In Canada, the Supreme Court held in Sauvé v. Canada (Chief Electoral Officer) (2002), that a {{statutory}} provision prohibiting prisoners serving {{a sentence of}} two years or more from voting unjustifiably infringed the fundamental right to vote guaranteed by section 3 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The Court noted that the Government could not demonstrate how denying prisoners the vote helped the stated aims of the relevant statute; a democracy built on <b>inclusiveness,</b> democracy and citizen participation cannot be party to a law that disenfranchises a considerable part of the population. There was also no credible theory why prisoners should be {{denied the right to}} vote as a form of punishment, as it is arbitrary and not related to the offender's criminal act nor does it deter crime or rehabilitate criminals.|$|E
5|$|After winning {{re-election}} by defeating Republican opponent Mitt Romney, Obama {{was sworn}} in {{for a second term}} in 2013. During his second term, Obama promoted <b>inclusiveness</b> for LGBT Americans, with his administration filing briefs that urged the Supreme Court to strike down same-sex marriage bans as unconstitutional (United States v. Windsor and Obergefell v. Hodges). Obama advocated for gun control in response to the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting, and issued wide-ranging executive actions concerning climate change and immigration. In foreign policy, Obama ordered military intervention in Iraq in response to gains made by ISIL after the 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, continued the process of ending U.S. combat operations in Afghanistan, promoted discussions that led to the 2015 Paris Agreement on global climate change, initiated sanctions against Russia following the invasion in Ukraine and again after Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections, brokered a nuclear deal with Iran, and normalized U.S. relations with Cuba. Obama left office in January 2017 with a 60% approval rating. He currently resides in Washington, D.C. His presidential library will be built in Chicago.|$|E

25|$|In the {{interest}} of <b>inclusiveness</b> and because perceptions {{that members of the}} public saw soccer as a migrants' game, all clubs were required to adopt non-ethnic names after a ruling by the QSF in 1973 (see 'Post-war to the 1960s' above for more information regarding club names).|$|E
25|$|According to Acemoglu and Robinson's framework, {{economic}} growth {{will change the}} economic resource distribution and thus affect political institutions.

25|$|The Sri Vaishnava {{community}} {{consists of}} both Smarta Brahmans and non-Brahmans. It existed {{along with a}} larger purana-based Brahamanic worshippers of Vishnu, and non-Brahmanic groups who worshipped and felt possessed by non-Vishnu village deities. The Sri Vaishnavism movement grew with its social <b>inclusiveness,</b> where emotional devotionalism to personal god (Vishnu) has been open without limitation to gender or caste.|$|E

25|$|The final {{emergence}} of a truly indigenous English-language poetry in the United States {{was the work of}} two poets, Walt Whitman (18191892) and Emily Dickinson (18301886). On the surface, these two poets could not have been less alike. Whitman's long lines, derived from the metric of the King James Version of the Bible, and his democratic <b>inclusiveness</b> stand in stark contrast with Dickinson's concentrated phrases and short lines and stanzas, derived from Protestant hymnals.|$|E
25|$|The Collins home's {{spirit of}} self-sacrifice, welcome and <b>inclusiveness</b> later proved key in his {{capacity}} to unify people of all genders and walks of life and orchestrate them in an effective, enthusiastic, cooperative force for Irish self-determination. Collins's revolution was also a family affair. He continued {{to work closely with}} his brothers throughout the independence struggle and with cousins such as Nancy O'Brien, one of his most important moles in the British administration.|$|E
25|$|Native American {{culture has}} long been a source of {{inspiration}} in Camp Fire's traditional council activities. Native American culture has served as the inspiration for ceremonial activities and attire, camp and council names, respect for nature and the environment, and the use of symbols by many councils. For Camp Fire, Native American symbolism was a natural outgrowth of an appreciation for differences and cultural <b>inclusiveness.</b> The theory was that such symbolism enabled– and even encouraged– self-reflection and personal growth.|$|E
25|$|In {{the autumn}} of 2012, Hamline {{students}} and faculty protested the school's refusal to condemn the proposed Minnesota constitutional amendment that would have banned equal marriage rights for all citizens. Hamline's attempt to stay neutral on the issue was seen as inconsistent with the university's anti-discrimination policy and its espoused values of diversity and <b>inclusiveness,</b> {{as well as with}} its United Methodist heritage and identity, since the Minnesota Annual Conference of the United Methodist Church had voted to publicly oppose the amendment.|$|E
25|$|The first Absolutely Incredible Kid Day, a call {{to action}} for all adults to {{communicate}} through letters their love and commitment to children, took place in 1997. In 2003 to further its commitment and <b>inclusiveness,</b> Camp Fire USA began translating its curricula to Spanish. As a way to excite and educate children in Pre-K, the Little Stars program, first developed by Camp Fire Green Country, was introduced nationally in 2005. Designated for ages 3–5 Little Stars builds confidence and a sense of belonging in children.|$|E
25|$|According to Colwell, {{the quality}} and <b>inclusiveness</b> of a country's health care system affects the control of cholera, {{as it did in}} the Zimbabwean cholera outbreak. While {{sanitation}} practices are important, when governments respond quickly and have readily available vaccines, the country will have a lower cholera death toll. Affordability of vaccines can be a problem; if the governments do not provide vaccinations, only the wealthy may be able to afford them and there will be a greater toll on the country's poor. The speed with which government leaders respond to cholera outbreaks is important.|$|E
25|$|YMCA Canada was {{established}} over 160 {{years ago as}} a charity dedicated to the health of both individuals and communities.

Together, they serve 2 million people in more than 1000 communities across Canada - and they keep growing.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} epitomised {{the dilemma}} of the Labour Party. In contrast to Sheehan's policy of basic social change and political <b>inclusiveness,</b> the ILP confused voters with a mixed message. The party's new March constitution abandoned its working class character and diluted its objectives, in its desire {{and in order to}} broaden the class basis of the new party to appeal to white-collar professionals. In the long term it also failed due to lack of branch organisation (Dublin having only one branch) so that in the following 1932 general election its number of Dáil seats sank to an all-time low of 7, from 13 in September 1927 (and 22 in 1922).|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to Fukuyama's comments, Acemoglu and Robinson replied on their blog. First, {{they agreed that}} their work is largely inspired by North, Wallis and Weingast's work but explained that they build on and complement each other's work. Second, {{with reference to the}} criticism of oversimplification, they countered by describing the oversimplification as an approach to decompose complex political institutions; {{that it is necessary to}} conceptualize and to avoid focusing too narrowly on a single aspect of institutions. Last, on China, they attribute the rapid economic growth in China to the some (but yet limited) level of <b>inclusiveness,</b> as was also seen in the example of the Soviet Union in the 1970s.|$|E
25|$|Reform Judaism (also {{known as}} Liberal Judaism or Progressive Judaism) {{is a major}} Jewish {{denomination}} that emphasizes the evolving nature of the faith, the superiority of its ethical aspects to the ceremonial ones, and a belief in a continuous revelation not centered on the theophany at Mount Sinai. A liberal strand of Judaism, it {{is characterized by a}} lesser stress on ritual and personal observance, regarding Jewish Law as non-binding and the individual Jew as autonomous, and openness to external influences and progressive values. The origins of Reform Judaism lay in 19th-century Germany, where its early principles were formulated by Rabbi Abraham Geiger and his associates; since the 1970s, the movement adopted a policy of <b>inclusiveness</b> and acceptance, inviting as many as possible to partake in its communities, rather than strict theoretical clarity. Its greatest center today is in North America.|$|E
25|$|Kebatinan or Kejawen (Javanese beliefs) or Kepercayaan kepada Tuhan Yang Maha Esa (Believer of One Supreme God) is {{an amalgam}} of animism, Hindu-Buddhist, and Islamic — {{especially}} Sufi — beliefs. The beliefs is rooted in Javanese history and spiritualism with the tendency to syncretise aspects of different religions {{in search of the}} common ground. This loosely organised current of thought and practice was legitimised in the 1945 constitution and, in 1973, when it was recognised as Kepercayaan kepada Tuhan Yang Maha Esa (Indonesian: Believer of One Supreme God) that somewhat gain the status as one of the agama, President Suharto counted himself as one of its adherents. The Kebatinan or Kepercayaan have no certain prophet, sacred book, nor distinct religious festivals and rituals; it {{has more to do with}} each adherents internalised transcendental vision and beliefs in their relations with others and with the supreme being. As the result there is an <b>inclusiveness</b> that the kebatinan believer could identify themselves with one of six officially recognised religions, at least in their identity card, while still subscribe to their kebatinan belief and way of life.|$|E
25|$|The next {{important}} step {{in the history of}} Dutch nationality was the 1848 constitution which stated that (1) a person had to be Dutch to possess the right of nationality and (2) all those with Dutch citizenship have the ability to be employed in public services. In this way, nationality law became part of public law. However, the definition of nationality remained in the code of civil law. This created a problem because not all those defined Dutch by the 1838 civil code were necessarily privileged to enjoy public rights. Because of this, a new nationality law was implemented in 1850 in order to limit the <b>inclusiveness</b> of the nationality law based on the French system. Nevertheless, the new 1850 nationality law did not replace the 1838 civil code and this in turn {{led to the creation of}} a double nationality; political nationality as stated in 1850, and civil nationality of the 1838 civil code. The uncertainties were eliminated in 1892 with the implementation of the Nationality Act which replaced both 1838 and 1850 nationality acts. The new law was based on the German system of jus sanguinis and excluded all previous mention of the principle of jus soli. The new Dutch nationality law survived until the amendments of 1985.|$|E
500|$|Canada's culture draws {{influences}} {{from its}} {{broad range of}} constituent nationalities, and policies that promote a [...] "just society" [...] are constitutionally protected. Canada has placed emphasis on equality and <b>inclusiveness</b> for all its people. Multiculturalism is often cited as one of Canada's significant accomplishments, and a key distinguishing element of Canadian identity. In Quebec, cultural identity is strong, and many commentators speak of a culture of Quebec that is distinct from English Canadian culture. However, as a whole, Canada is in theory a cultural mosaic—a collection of regional ethnic subcultures.|$|E

500|$|According to {{the scholar}} Mark McLeod, the temple {{incorporated}} aspects of both Mahayana and Theravada traditions in its style {{of practice and}} architecture. He felt that the modest and uncomplicated wooden statue of the Buddha is more reminiscent of Theravada architecture, while the Ksitigarbha and Avalokiteshvara statues are distinctly Mahayana, as these figures are absent from Theravada teachings. One monk interviewed by McLeod said that his temple's interpretation of Buddhism and its <b>inclusiveness</b> of Mahayana and Theravada aspects is [...] "like a tree, which needs roots, a trunk, branches, and leaves; it cannot survive if any is missing." [...] He added that the appropriateness of a teaching, practice, symbol, is independent of its origin, but is determined by [...] "whether or not it accords with the Buddha's Teachings." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{theme of}} the {{interfaith}} worship service reflected <b>inclusiveness</b> and religious diversity, {{with a mix of}} Protestant pastors, female Hindu and Muslim religious leaders, rabbis and Catholic and Episcopal bishops who delivered scripture readings and prayers throughout the service. Prayers for the service drew from passages from the 1789 inauguration prayer service of George Washington and the 1865inaugural address of Abraham Lincoln, including phrases such as [...] "with malice toward none, with charity for all". The featured sermon for the inaugural prayer service was delivered by Reverend SharonE. Watkins, general minister and president of the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) and the first woman to deliver the sermon for the inaugural prayer service. In her sermon, Watkins integrated passages from a variety of sources, such as passages summoned from sources rooted in the Hindu, Jewish, Muslim and Cherokee faiths.|$|E
500|$|The {{legitimacy}} of Andrianampoinimerina's reign was bolstered by his characterization of other Merina rulers' claims to power as fanjakana hova - rule by hova (commoners), whose lineages were only weakly {{tied to the}} line of succession relative to his own. [...] In addition, like Merina kings before him, he consolidated the power of the sampy (royal idols) and attributed the success and {{legitimacy of}} his reign to the proper respect shown toward these conduits of supernatural power. [...] He balanced this strengthening of the supernatural and ancestral legitimacy of his kingship against <b>inclusiveness</b> of the commoner class by making several hova from the Tsimiamboholahy and Tsimahafotsy clans into powerful and trusted advisers. He also consulted a group of ombiasy (royal advisers of the Antaimoro clan), who were literate in the sorabe script historically used on the east coast to inscribe a series of ancient texts considered to contain powerful magic and specialized scientific and ritual knowledge.|$|E
500|$|Larkin's {{style is}} {{bound up with}} his {{recurring}} themes and subjects, which include death and fatalism, as in his final major poem [...] "Aubade". Poet Andrew Motion observes of Larkin's poems that [...] "their rage or contempt is always checked by the ... energy of their language and the satisfactions of their articulate formal control", and contrasts two aspects of his poetic personality—on the one hand an enthusiasm for [...] "symbolist moments" [...] and [...] "freely imaginative narratives", {{and on the other}} a [...] "remorseless factuality" [...] and [...] "crudity of language". Motion defines this as a [...] "life-enhancing struggle between opposites", and concludes that his poetry is typically [...] "ambivalent": [...] "His three mature collections have developed attitudes and styles of ... imaginative daring: in their prolonged debates with despair, they testify to wide sympathies, contain passages of frequently transcendent beauty, and demonstrate a poetic <b>inclusiveness</b> which is of immense consequence for his literary heirs." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Grilled Cheesus" [...] is {{intended}} to begin a season arc depicting the glee club members rallying around those who are subject to bullying and persecution. For Glee second season, Murphy confirmed plans to cast a Christian character on the show, expressing desires to keep Glee a [...] "show about inclusiveness". In an interview with TV Guide, Murphy said on Christianity, [...] "If we're trying to form a world of <b>inclusiveness,</b> we've got to include {{that point of view}} as well." [...] He predicted [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] would be the most controversial episode of the series to date, as it depicts the spiritual and emotional importance of God to the characters. Murphy aimed to address religion in a [...] "socially responsible" [...] way, and compared [...] "Grilled Cheesus" [...] to topical Norman Lear shows of the 1970s. He hoped to produce a balanced depiction of the subject matter, and he, along with co-writers Brennan and Falchuk, checked the script to ensure that for every anti-religious sentiment conveyed, there was a pro-religious one to counterbalance it. The episode references several religions apart from Christianity; Puck and Rachel are both Jewish, Kurt hires an acupuncturist who is a Sikh, and makes a reference to the Flying Spaghetti Monster.|$|E
