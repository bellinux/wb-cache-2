40|$|INTRODUCTION In {{previous}} papers, {{new digital}} transmission schemes that can drastically simplify multiplexing and clock recovery {{have been investigated}} [1 - 4].

Then, conditions to be satisfied by line coding for hunting-free reframing will be investigated. II. MULTIPLED BLOCK CODES A.

40|$|AbstractA {{major problem}} in {{communication}} engineering system is the transmitting of information from source to receiver over a noisy channel. To check the error in <b>information</b> <b>digits</b> many error detecting and correcting codes have been developed. The main aim of these error correcting codes is to encode the <b>information</b> <b>digits</b> and decode these digits to detect and correct the common errors in transmission. This information theory concept helps to study the information transmission in biological systems and extend the field of coding theory into the biological domain. In the cellular level, the information in DNA is transformed into proteins. The sequence of bases like Adenine (A), Thymine (T), Guanine (G) and Cytosine (C) in DNA may be considered as digital codes which transmit genetic information. This paper shows the existence of any form error detecting code in the DNA structure, by encoding the DNA sequences using Hamming code...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{methods of}} {{encoding}} information into digital form include error check digits that are {{functions of the}} other <b>information</b> <b>digits.</b> When digital <b>information</b> is transmitted, {{the values of the}} error check digits can be computed from the <b>information</b> <b>digits</b> to determine whether the information has been received accurately. These error correcting codes make it possible to detect and correct common errors in transmission. The sequence of bases in DNA is also a digital code consisting of four symbols: A, C, G, and T. Does DNA also contain an error correcting code? Such a code would allow repair enzymes to protect the fidelity of nonreplicating DNA and increase the accuracy of replication. If a linear block error correcting code is present in DNA then some bases would be a linear function of the other bases in each set of bases. We developed an efficient procedure to determine whether such an error correcting code is present in the base sequence. We illustrate the use of this procedure by using it to analyze the lac operon and the gene for cytochrome c. These genes do not appear to contain such a simple error correcting code...|$|R

This paper contains new efficient methods to design m-ary {{balanced code}}s which improve the constructions found in the literature, for all alphabet size m ⩾ 2. To design such codes, the information words which are close to be balanced are encoded using single maps obtained by a new generalization of Knuth's complementation method to the m-ary alphabet that we introduce in this paper. Whereas, the remaining information words are compressed via suitable m-ary uniquely decodable variable length codes and then balanced using the saved space. For any m⩾ 2, infinite families of m-ary balanced codes are given with r check digits and k⩽[1 /(1 − 2 α) ][mr − 1) /(m − 1) ] − c 1 (m, α) r −c 2 (m, α) <b>information</b> <b>digits,</b> where α ϵ [0, 1 / 2) can be chosen arbitrarily close to 1 / 2.

40|$|A symbol {{permutation}} invariant balanced (SPI-balanced) code {{over the}} alphabet ZZ(m) = { 0, 1, [...] ., m - 1 } is a block code over ZZm such that each alphabet symbol occurs {{as many times}} as any other symbol in every codeword. For this reason, every permutation among the symbols of the alphabet changes an SPI-balanced code into an SPI-balanced code. This means that SPI-balanced words are "the most balanced" among all possible m-ary balanced word types and this property makes them very attractive from the application perspective. In particular, they can be used to achieve m-ary DC-free communication, to detect/correct asymmetric/unidirectional errors on the m-ary asymmetric/unidirectional channel, to achieve delay-insensitive communication, to maintain data integrity in digital optical disks, and so on. This paper gives some efficient methods to convert (encode) m-ary information sequences into m-ary SPI-balanced codes whose redundancy is equal to roughly double the minimum possible redundancy r(min). It is proven that r(min) similar or equal to vertical bar(m - 1) / 2] log(m) n - (1 / 2) [1 /log(2 pi) m) m-(1 /log(2 pi) m) for any code which converts k <b>information</b> <b>digits</b> into an SPI-balanced code of length n = k + r.

Regression analysis was used to evaluate a model consisting of the 3 subtests, <b>information,</b> arithmetic, and <b>digit</b> symbols. Results: Variables included in the 3 -subtest short form accounted for 94 % of the variance for patients with psychotic disorder and 88 % of the variance for healthy controls. Correlation coefficients were 0. 97 for patients with psychotic disorders and 0. 94 for healthy controls. Both for patients and healthy controls, the 3 -subtest estimates fell within 5 points of the 4 -subtest scores (with a maximum of 76 points) in 98 % of cases.
