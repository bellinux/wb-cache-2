40|$|Spontaneous {{tumors of the}} {{mammary gland}} in <b>female</b> <b>dogs,</b> {{represent}} the most frequent neoplasms observed in the small animal clinic, which explains the high interest of researchers {{in the study of}} this lesion. This study aimed to determine the frequency of mammary tumors in <b>female</b> <b>dogs</b> treated at HOSPMEV/UFBA, in Salvador, from January 2006 to April 2008, as well as to carry out the clinical characterization, histopathologic classification and the georeferencing of this pathology. The results showed a high prevalence of mammary tumors in <b>female</b> <b>dogs,</b> with most of the tumors in more advanced stages and the carcinomas in mixed tumors the predominant histologic type. There was maalso a. correlation between socioeconomic characteristics of the study population with known prognostic factors for mammary neoplasms in <b>female</b> <b>dogs.</b> These results reflect the delay in providing veterinary medical care. Thus, it's important to educate the population regarding the prevention and detection of mammary cancer in <b>female</b> <b>dogs</b> looking for an early diagnosis and appropriate therapy...|$|R

25|$|There {{is also a}} {{well-known}} Romanian legend about {{a young man named}} Dragoș Vodă who went hunting for an aurochs or a wisent, followed by a bunch of dogs. During the hunting expedition, all the dogs got tired and fell down, except for a <b>female</b> <b>dog</b> named Molda which ran to the wild animal all the time. After the wisent entered into a river, the <b>female</b> <b>dog</b> did the same thing, but unfortunately it got drowned and died in that way. Thanks to Molda, Dragoș finally killed the wisent and cut its head off, and in memory of his dog's sacrifice, he named the river and the land after MOLda – MOLdovA. That legend, which is a fictional story, explains the name of the territory and country's etymology and also explains why the symbol of Moldova is the wisent head.|$|E
25|$|This type of {{infection}} can occur when a pregnant <b>female</b> <b>dog</b> is infected with CPV2. The adult may develop immunity {{with little or}} no clinical signs of disease.

25|$|A mammary tumor is a {{neoplasm}} {{originating in}} the mammary gland. It is a common finding in older <b>female</b> <b>dogs</b> and cats that are not spayed, but they are found in other animals as well. The mammary glands in dogs and cats are associated with their nipples and extend from {{the underside of the}} chest to the groin {{on both sides of the}} midline. There are many differences between mammary tumors in animals and breast cancer in humans, including tumor type, malignancy, and treatment options. The prevalence in dogs is about three times that of women. In dogs, mammary tumors are the second most common tumor (after skin tumors) over all and the most common tumor in <b>female</b> <b>dogs</b> with a reported incidence of 3.4%. Multiple studies have documented that spaying <b>female</b> <b>dogs</b> when young greatly decreases their risk of developing mammary neoplasia when aged. Compared with <b>female</b> <b>dogs</b> left intact, those spayed before puberty have 0.5% of the risk, those spayed after one estrous cycle have 8.0% of the risk, and dogs spayed after two estrous cycles have 26.0% of the risk of developing mammary neoplasia later in life. Overall, unspayed <b>female</b> <b>dogs</b> have a seven times greater risk of developing mammary neoplasia than do those that are spayed. While the benefit of spaying decreases with each estrous cycle, some benefit has been demonstrated in <b>female</b> <b>dogs</b> even up to 9 years of age. There is a much lower risk (about 1 percent) in male dogs and a risk in cats about half that of dogs.|$|R
25|$|The {{original}} cross {{was of a}} yellow-coloured retriever, 'Nous', with a Tweed Water Spaniel <b>female</b> <b>dog,</b> 'Belle'. The Tweed Water Spaniel is now extinct, but {{was then}} common in the border country. Marjoribanks had purchased Nous in 1865 from an unregistered litter of otherwise black wavy-coated retriever pups. In 1868, this cross produced a litter that included four pups; these four became {{the basis of a}} breeding program which included the Irish Setter, the sandy-coloured Bloodhound, the St. John's water dog of Newfoundland, and two more wavy-coated black retrievers. The bloodline was also inbred and selected for trueness to Marjoribanks' idea of the ultimate hunting dog. His vision included a more vigorous and powerful dog than previous retrievers, one that would still be gentle and trainable. Russian sheepdogs are not mentioned in these records, nor are any other working dog breeds. The ancestry of the Golden Retriever is all sporting dogs, in line with Marjoribanks' goals. The Golden Retriever was active and powerful and had a gentle mouth for retrieving games while on hunts.|$|E
25|$|The Kelb tal-Fenek {{is usually}} taken out to hunt {{at night when}} there are fewer distractions. Generally, the hunters will take their dogs into the {{countryside}} and release pairs of a male and a <b>female</b> <b>dog</b> in each compass direction. The dogs will then search out their prey using scent. When a rabbit is found the hounds will give chase, the small and more agile female in the lead with the male keeping the rabbit from darting {{too far to the}} sides. At this point the dogs giving chase will emit a high pitched bark, attracting the other dogs and the hunters, all of whom will come running. By the time the hunters and other dogs arrive the rabbit will almost always have taken to the ground. The hunters will then gather and leash all but one dog, then place nets over all of the likely escape holes of the rabbit. Finally the hunter will take a ferret (with a small bell attached) from a round wicker basket, and places it into the last entrance to the rabbit's burrow. The Kelb tal-Fenek can hear the little bell up to 3 meters down under the rocky terrain. When the ferret flushes the rabbit out a hole, one free dog swoops down upon it. This style of hunting is mentioned by Strabo about hunting in the Balearic Islands under Roman rule, and the Maltese word for ferret—"nemes"—may have its roots in the Greek word ''.|$|E

25|$|While the age-unrelated {{risks and}} {{benefits}} cited above also apply to early-age neutering, various {{studies have indicated that}} the procedure is safe and not associated with increased mortality or serious health and behavioral problems when compared to conventional age neutering. Anesthesia recovery in young animals is usually more rapid and there are fewer complications. One study found that in <b>female</b> <b>dogs</b> there is an increasing risk of urinary incontinence the earlier the procedure is carried out; the study recommended that <b>female</b> <b>dogs</b> be spayed no earlier than 3 to 4 months of age. A later study comparing <b>female</b> <b>dogs</b> spayed between 4 and 6 months and after 6 months showed no increased risk.|$|R

This study analyzed 20 intact <b>female</b> <b>dogs</b> with both clinical and sonographic diagnosis of pyometra. Dogs were treated with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, and an ovariohysterectomy was performed. The following parameters were assessed at eight separate time points: blood pressure; serum creatinine, phosphorus, and urea levels; urinalysis and urinary biochemical parameters [urinary gamma-glutamyl transferase (uGGT) and urinary protein-to-creatinine ratio (UPCR) ]; glomerular filtration rate (GFR); and urine output. All dogs showed some degree of kidney injury {{at the time of}} pyometra diagnosis. This was transient in most animals, resolving with treatment of the pyometra. Measurement of uGGT and UPCR identified renal parenchymal injury, helping to determine the prognosis of the animals analyzed in the present study...|$|R
