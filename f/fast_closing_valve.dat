40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the {{evaluation}} of the investment in the <b>fast</b> <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> replacement in The dam Vranov using Computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The final effects of the <b>fast</b> <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> replacement will be examined on three different types of valves with regard to the turbine output in operation zone and without the influence of water intake runner and turbine draft tube. The aim of the thesis is to theoretically evaluate alternatives of the <b>fast</b> <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> replacement and define its basic characteristics and classifications...|$|E
40|$|Fast acting valves {{are often}} applied for quick safety {{shut-down}} of pipelines for liquids and {{gases in the}} chemical and petrochemical industry {{as well as in}} power plants and state water supplies. The fast deceleration of the liquid leads to water hammer upstream the valve and to cavitational hammer downstream the <b>fast</b> <b>closing</b> <b>valve.</b> The valve characteristics given by manufacturers are usually measured at steady state flow conditions of the liquid. In comparison, the dynamic characteristics depend on the initial liquid velocity, valve closing velocity, the absolute pipe pressure and the pipe geometry. Fraunhofer UMSICHT conducts various test series examining valve dynamic characteristics in order of the dynamic analysis of pressure surges in fast closing processes. Therefore a test rig is used which consists of two pipelines of DN 50 and DN 100 with an approximate length of 230 m each. In this paper the results of performed pressure surge experiments with fast closing and opening valves will be compared to calculations of commercial software programs such as MONA, FLOWMASTER 2. Thus the calculation software for water supply, power plants, oil and gas and chemical industry can be permanently improved...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} experimental work and simulations of pressure surges resulting from <b>fast</b> <b>closing</b> <b>valves</b> and activation of an emergency release coupling (ERC) in ship-to-ship LNG transfer. The first part {{presents the results of}} an ambient water flow test with a <b>fast</b> <b>closing</b> 4 -inch full bore valve in combination with a 4 -inch flexible multi-composite hose. High amplitude pressure surges up to 4 times the working pressure occur upstream of the valve. Pressure surge amplitudes strongly depend on <b>valve</b> <b>closing</b> time and flow rate. The propagation speed in the upstream hose is lowered considerably due to the hose flexibility. Furthermore the temporarily deformation of the hose results in loss of energy and acoustic damping of the pressure surge amplitudes. The measurement results are compared to the results of modeling. Acoustic damping and propagation speed of sound show a non-linear behavior of the hose, due to a varying internal pressure, which is not captured in the present modeling techniques. The second part of the paper {{describes the}} results of a full scale flow test on an 8 -inch ERC (KLAW make) for LNG ship-to-ship transfer (Figure 1). The ERC in the test is located downstream of an 8 -inch 15 -meter long multi-composite flexible hose. The test is intended to investigate operational and mechanical integrity, spill rate and the impact of pressure transients and shock loads on the ERC including upstream hose and downstream piping...|$|R
40|$|Using an {{additional}} valve (i. e. clapper check valves) downstream the main <b>closing</b> <b>valve,</b> <b>fast</b> <b>valve</b> <b>closing</b> is possible without any cavitational hammer. Additionally a new passive safety system (ABS-Armatur) {{for the prevention}} of water hammer upstream the main <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> is introduced. Upstream the closure valve, a brake line connects the transport liquid of the m ain pipe with a hydraulic brake system. In case of <b>valve</b> action (<b>closing),</b> the pressure upstream the valve increases rapidly causing a fast interruption of the closing process. With decreasing pressure the closing process may continue. By combination of both methods pressure up - as well as downstream the <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> may be safely controlled...|$|R
40|$|Article {{describes}} {{simulation of}} unsteady flow during water hammer with two programs, which use different numerical approaches to solve ordinary one dimensional differential equations describing {{the dynamics of}} hydraulic elements and pipes. First one is Matlab-Simulink-SimHydraulics, which is a commercial software developed to solve the dynamics of general hydraulic systems. It defines them with block elements. The other software is called HYDRA and {{it is based on}} the Lax-Wendrff numerical method, which serves as a tool to solve the momentum and continuity equations. This program was developed in Matlab by Brno University of Technology. Experimental measurements were performed on a simple test rig, which consists of an elastic pipe with strong damping connecting two reservoirs. Water hammer is induced with <b>fast</b> <b>closing</b> the <b>valve.</b> Physical properties of liquid and pipe elasticity parameters were considered in both simulations, which are in very good agreement and differences in comparison with experimental data are minimal...|$|R

The microphone response was tested with small implosions of normal air and hydrogen at different gas (pressure x volume) quantities. The effect of mechanical shocks and mechanical vibrations on the microphone response can be made negligible. (C) 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
50|$|A {{practical}} {{difference between}} dynamic and positive displacement pumps {{is how they}} operate under <b>closed</b> <b>valve</b> conditions. Positive displacement pumps physically displace fluid, so <b>closing</b> a <b>valve</b> downstream of a positive displacement pump produces a continual pressure build up that can cause mechanical failure of pipeline or pump. Dynamic pumps differ in {{that they can be}} safely operated under <b>closed</b> <b>valve</b> conditions (for short periods of time).|$|R

Failure {{was considered to be}} system failure to operate on demand, and the performance of the sprinkler system after operation was not considered. While specific information for each of the sprinkler systems was not presented, probabilities for 8 failure modes were included. The source of the probabilities used was not made explicit. Two of these were human-based: inadvertently <b>closed</b> <b>valves</b> and failing to trip a manual release. System reliability was found to be most sensitive to the probability of an inadvertently <b>closed</b> <b>valve</b> and the time between inspections.|$|R

50|$|Conversely, the <b>closing</b> of the <b>valve</b> {{does not}} {{immediately}} stop flow at the runner entrance, which continues completely unaffected until {{the signal that}} the <b>valve</b> <b>closed</b> reaches it. The <b>closing</b> <b>valve</b> causes a buildup of pressure that travels up the runner as a positive wave. The runner entrance continues to flow at full speed, forcing the pressure to rise until the signal reaches the entrance. This very considerable pressure rise {{can be seen on}} the graph below, it rises far above atmospheric pressure.|$|R

5000|$|Early intake <b>valve</b> <b>closing</b> (EIVC)Another way to {{decrease}} the pumping losses associated with low engine speed, high vacuum conditions is by <b>closing</b> the intake <b>valve</b> earlier than normal. This involves <b>closing</b> the intake <b>valve</b> midway through the intake stroke. Air/fuel demands are so low at low-load conditions and the work required to fill the cylinder is relatively high, so Early intake <b>valve</b> <b>closing</b> greatly reduces pumping losses. [...] Studies have shown early intake <b>valve</b> <b>closing</b> reduces pumping losses by 40%, and increases fuel economy by 7%. It also reduced nitric oxide emissions by 24% at partial load conditions. A possible downside to early intake <b>valve</b> <b>closing</b> is that it significantly lowers {{the temperature of the}} combustion chamber, which can increase hydrocarbon emissions.|$|R

50|$|The {{convenience}} of the camshaft {{is that not}} only does it keep the timing of the opening and <b>closing</b> <b>valves</b> and injecting fuel through its cams, it is also responsible for the mechanical force that is required to actually open and <b>close</b> the <b>valves</b> and power the port and helix fuel pump. The camshaftless intelligent system uses the rotation of the engine to power an axial piston pump that pressurizes a hydraulic oil system. The potential energy from the hydraulic pressure is directed by the electronically controlled servo system to drive InFI (Intelligent Fuel Injection) and InVA (Intelligent Valve Actuation) systems.|$|R
