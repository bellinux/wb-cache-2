Tourism significantly increased after the First Transcontinental Railroad was completed in 1869, but the long horseback ride to reach the area was a deterrent. Three stagecoach roads were built in the mid-1870s to provide better access for the growing number of visitors to Yosemite Valley.|$|E

At the Victorian Championships, she showed her potential by setting a state record of 17.4 seconds (s) for the 25-yard freestyle in the under-8 division.

She progressed steadily, sweeping the state age titles from nine to 13, setting records that were often faster than those by boys of the same age.|$|E

In a 1935 case, the Court struck all the New Court cases from Kentucky common law.|$|E
