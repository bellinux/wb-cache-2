40|$|We {{present the}} designs of probes for making {{critical}} current density (J c) measurements on anisotropic high-temperature superconducting tapes {{as a function of}} field, field orientation, temperature and strain in our 40 mm bore, split-pair 15 T <b>horizontal</b> <b>magnet.</b> Emphasis is placed on the design of three components: the vapour-cooled current leads, the variable temperature enclosure, and the springboard-shaped bending beam sample holder. The vapour-cooled brass critical-current leads used superconducting tapes and in operation ran hot with a duty cycle (D) of ∼ 0. 2. This work provides formulae for optimising cryogenic consumption and calculating cryogenic boil-off, associated with current leads used to make J c measurements, made by uniformly ramping the current up to a maximum current (I max) and then reducing the current very quickly to zero. They include consideration of the effects of duty cycle, static helium boil-off from the magnet and Dewar (b ′), and the maximum safe temperature for the critical-current leads (T max). Our optimized critical-current leads have a boil-off that is about 30 % less than leads optimized for magnet operation at the same maximum current. Numerical calculations show that the optimum cross-sectional area (A) for each current lead can be parameterized by LImax/A=[1. 46 D− 0. 18 L 0. 4 (Tmax− 300) 0. 25 D− 0. 09 + 750 (b′/Imax) D 10 − 3 Imax− 2. 87 b′]× 106 Am− 1 where L is the current lead's length and the current lead is operated in liquid helium. An optimum A of 132 mm 2 is obtained when I max = 1000 A, T max = 400 K, D = 0. 2, b ′ = 0. 3 l[*]h− 1 and L = 1. 0 m. The optimized helium consumption was found to be 0. 7 l[*]h− 1. When the static boil-off is small, optimized leads have a boil-off that can be roughly parameterized by: b/I max[*] ≈ (1. 35 × 10 − 3) D 0. 41 l[*]h‑ 1 [*]A− 1.

40|$|Interventions, like biopsies, tumor therapy, {{injection}} of drugs, placements of intravascular implants (stents, coils, etc.) {{and many more}} are performed image guided. MRI would be the preferred guidance device {{due to the fact}} that it provides the best soft tissue contrast and comes with no or little negative side effects for the human body. Several known problems have to be overcome while working in or around a MRI system, mainly related to the strong magnetic and electric fields, which require the use of special materials and special shielding. Interventions are also limited due to the relatively small openings of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>magnet</b> systems (bore diameter of 60 cm to 70 cm). Open scanners facilitate the access to the patient much better, but they also use lower magnetic field strength and therefore do not provide equally good image quality. Interventions are therefore usually performed outside of the magnet bore. This requires moving the patient in and out of the magnet as the actual position of a medical instrument has to be frequently updated through newly acquired images. Workflow and quality of intervention - in the case of a needle therapy for example - could be significantly improved, if the physician would know where to penetrate skin, in which angle to hold the instrument and what the distance from skin to target (organ, tumor, etc.) is. Devices inside the MRI bore could mark the penetration point including the required angle with a laser on the patient's skin after the intervention was planned by a physician on the previously obtained MR images. Also, a mechanical apparatus could be aligned by such a device, through which the instrument can be inserted into the body. Several of such systems have been proposed, but all are complicated, very expensive, and further limit the available space inside the bore. The goal was therefore to develop an innovative and inexpensive navigation assistant, to be placed inside the bore of the MRI system (reduced size) - but with the option to also use it outside the magnet - which is able to identify (with e. g. a laser diode) the desired entry position (point of skin penetration and angle of penetration) for the intervention/therapy on the patients body...|$|E

The TW Primate System (TWPS) uses the radio frequency shield of the gradient system of a human whole-body 7 T MRI system as a waveguide to propagate a circularly polarized B 1 field represented by the TE 11 mode. This mode is excited by a specifically designed 2 -port patch antenna. For receive, a customized neuroimaging monkey head receive-only coil was designed.

40|$|CERN is {{constructing}} the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a superconducting accelerator that will collide protons at {{a center of}} mass energy of 14 TeV. The two colliding beams will each store an energy of up to 540 MJ, which must be safely deposited within one beam revolution of 89 mu s on two external absorbers located about 700 m from the extraction points {{at the end of}} dedicated extraction tunnels. To avoid evaporation of the graphite absorber material by the very high energy density of the incident beams, the deposition area of the beams on the absorber front face will be increased. This is done by a pair of sinusoidally powered orthogonal magnet systems producing approximately an e-shape figure of about 35 mm diameter, with a minimum velocity of 10 mm/ mu s during the dumping process. The pulse generators of the horizontally and vertically deflecting diluter magnets are composed of capacitor banks, discharged by stacks of solid state closing switches. They are connected to the magnets by 28 m long low inductance transmission lines. The discharge switches of both generators are triggered simultaneously. The generators of the vertical magnets include additional elements to obtain an automatic phase shift of 90 degrees with respect to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>magnets.</b> The capacitor banks, charged to a voltage of 10 and 22 kV, produce a damped sinusoidal oscillation of 27 kA maximum amplitude with a period of 73 and 79 mu s.

Uniplanar gradient designs sacrifice gradient uniformity for high gradient efficiency and slew rate, and are attractive for surface imaging applications where open access {{from one side}} of the sample is required. However, decreasing the size of the uniplanar gradient set presents several unique engineering challenges, particularly for heat dissipation and thermal insulation of the sample from gradient heating.

40|$|Skew quadrupoles {{are well}} known for their {{capability}} of tilting beams around their longitudinal axes. However, dipoles can produce the same effect. A horizontal bending dipole aligned with an inclination (slope) angle phi {{with respect to the}} reference coordinate system introduces a small tilt (roll) angle psi into the beam, which for small angles is proportional to the product of the magnet bending angle alpha and the slope phi. For transfer lines this effect has previously been neglected (it is comparable to the tilt alignment tolerance of the magnets of the order of 0. 1 mrad rms), but for long lines with many <b>horizontal</b> bending <b>magnets</b> on relatively steep vertical slopes relative to the reference frame, a non-negligible tilt angle psi can accumulate between the local beam plane and the reference alignment system.

This is shown by deriving-a’non-dispersive condition connecting {{the average of the}} matched dispersion function with the quadrupole and sextupole components of the field. In the SLC Arcs, however, the achromats are rolled producing a dispersion mismatch. In this case, the horizontal (vertical) dispersion is affected linearly by vertical (<b>horizontal)</b> displacement of <b>magnets.</b> The integral condition connecting the dipole and quadrupole fields and the matched disperstan is also derived. Combining this with the non-dispersive condition and the analytic expression of the matched dispersion gives two simple relationships for the fields of second order achromats constructed of combined function magnets. - 3 ’h. e effects of the dispersion mismatch in the SLC Arcs is investigated using computer simulations. The results show that this mismatch will increase the sensitivity to transverse errors. We report the effects of certain systematic errors...|$|R
