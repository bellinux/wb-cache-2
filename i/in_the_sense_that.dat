5|$|Surface tension has the {{dimension}} of force per unit length, or of energy per unit area. The two are equivalent, but when referring to energy per unit of area, {{it is common to}} use the term surface energy, which is a more general term <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> it applies also to solids.|$|E

50|$|Stretching from Kingsley to Martin Amis, Ladlit was comic <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{traditional}} <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> {{it had a}} happy ending. It was romantic <b>in</b> <b>the</b> modern <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> it confronted men’s {{fear and}} final embrace of marriage and adult responsibilities. It was confessional <b>in</b> <b>the</b> postmodern <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> male protagonists and unreliable first-person narrators betrayed beneath their bravado {{the story of their}} insecurities, panic, cold sweats, performance anxieties and phobias. At {{the low end of the}} market, Ladlit was the masculine equivalent of the Bridget Jones Phenomenon; at the high end of the high street, it was a masterly examination of male identity in contemporary Britain".|$|R

5|$|Bach {{performed}} the cantata again while Thomaskantor in Leipzig, notably {{at his first}} Easter there on 9 April 1724. He also performed it the following year on 1 April 1725, in his second cycle of Leipzig cantatas, a cycle of chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. It followed in the cycle some forty newly composed cantatas. This early work fits the cycle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> {{it is based on}} a chorale, but its style is different from the others.|$|E

In the picture, the blue graphs are isomorphic but their dual red graphs are not. The upper red dual has a vertex with degree 6 (corresponding to the outer face of the blue graph) while in the lower red graph all degrees are less than 6.|$|E
5|$|During the 21st century, {{there will}} be 224 solar eclipses of which 77 will be partial, 72 will be annular, 68 will be total and 7 will be hybrids between total and annular eclipses. Of these, two annular and one total eclipse will be non-central, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the very center (axis) of the moon's shadow will miss the earth (for more {{information}} see gamma). In the 21st century {{the greatest number of}} eclipses in one year is four, in 2011, 2029, 2047, 2065, 2076, and 2094.

Everton do not play early kick-offs on Sundays in order to permit Sunday services at the church. The church is synonymous with the football club and a wooden church structure was in place when Goodison Park was originally built. Former Everton players such as Brian Harris have had their funeral service held there.|$|E
5|$|However, {{evidence}} {{pointing out}} that the number of bezants on each shield was greater than five during long periods following Afonso I's reign, as well as the fact that only in the 15th century was this legend registered on a chronicle by Fernão Lopes (1419), support this explanation as one of pure myth and highly charged with patriotic feeling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> Portugal was created by divine intervention and was destined for great things.|$|E
5|$|In {{many of the}} works, {{including}} the original series, Warhol drastically simplified the gold medallion that appears on Campbell's Soup cans by replacing the paired allegorical figures with a flat yellow disk. In most variations, the only hint of three-dimensionality came from the shading on the tin lid. Otherwise the image was flat. The works with torn labels are perceived as metaphors of life <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> even packaged food must meet its end. They are often described as expressionistic.|$|E

5|$|Languages express meaning by {{relating}} a sign form to a meaning, or its content. Sign forms must {{be something}} that can be perceived, for example, in sounds, images, or gestures, and then related to a specific meaning by social convention. Because the basic relation of meaning for most linguistic signs is based on social convention, linguistic signs can be considered arbitrary, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the convention is established socially and historically, rather than by means of a natural relation between a specific sign form and its meaning.|$|E

Representations appear {{in the description of}} fields in classical field theory, most importantly the electromagnetic field, and of particles in relativistic quantum mechanics, as well as of both particles and quantum fields in quantum field theory and of various objects in string theory and beyond. The representation theory also provides the theoretical ground for the concept of spin.

5|$|Maureen Ryan {{believed}} {{that one of}} the reasons the episode worked so well was because it left out the storylines with the Night's Watch and the Dothraki and focused in a single location.
