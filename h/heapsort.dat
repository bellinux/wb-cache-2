25|$|Introsort is an {{alternative}} to <b>heapsort</b> that combines quicksort and <b>heapsort</b> to retain advantages of both: worst case speed of <b>heapsort</b> and average speed of quicksort.|$|E
25|$|Bottom-up <b>heapsort</b> was {{announced}} as beating quicksort (with median-of-three pivot selection) on arrays of size ≥16000. This version of <b>heapsort</b> keeps the linear-time heap-building phase, but changes the second phase, as follows.|$|E
25|$|Merge sort on arrays has {{considerably}} better data cache performance, often outperforming <b>heapsort</b> {{on modern}} desktop computers because merge sort frequently accesses contiguous memory locations (good locality of reference); <b>heapsort</b> references are {{spread throughout the}} heap.|$|E
25|$|The <b>heapsort</b> {{algorithm}} can {{be divided}} into two parts.|$|E
25|$|<b>Heapsort</b> is not {{a stable}} sort; merge sort is stable.|$|E
25|$|The {{most direct}} {{competitor}} of quicksort is <b>heapsort.</b> Heapsort's running time is , but heapsort's average running time is usually considered slower than in-place quicksort. This result is debatable; some publications indicate the opposite. Introsort is {{a variant of}} quicksort that switches to <b>heapsort</b> when a bad case is detected to avoid quicksort's worst-case running time.|$|E
25|$|<b>Heapsort</b> {{primarily}} {{competes with}} quicksort, another very efficient general purpose nearly-in-place comparison-based sort algorithm.|$|E
25|$|In 1981 Dijkstra {{developed}} smoothsort, a comparison-based sorting algorithm and {{a variation}} of <b>heapsort.</b>|$|E
25|$|Merge sort {{is used in}} {{external}} sorting; <b>heapsort</b> is not. Locality {{of reference}} is the issue.|$|E
25|$|In {{computer}} science, <b>heapsort</b> is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. <b>Heapsort</b> can {{be thought}} of as an improved selection sort: like that algorithm, it divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region. The improvement consists of the use of a heap data structure rather than a linear-time search to find the maximum.|$|E
25|$|Merge sort parallelizes {{well and}} can achieve close to linear speedup with a trivial implementation; <b>heapsort</b> {{is not an}} obvious {{candidate}} for a parallel algorithm.|$|E
25|$|A binary heap is a heap data {{structure}} {{that takes the}} form of a binary tree. Binary heaps are a common way of implementing priority queues. The binary heap was introduced by J. W. J. Williams in 1964, as a {{data structure}} for <b>heapsort.</b>|$|E
25|$|General method: insertion, exchange, selection, merging, etc. Exchange sorts include {{bubble sort}} and quicksort. Selection sorts include shaker sort and <b>heapsort.</b> Also whether the {{algorithm}} is serial or parallel. The {{remainder of this}} discussion almost exclusively concentrates upon serial algorithms and assumes serial operation.|$|E
25|$|This {{implementation}} {{is used in}} the <b>heapsort</b> algorithm, {{where it}} allows the space in the input array to be reused to store the heap (i.e. the algorithm is done in-place). The implementation is also useful for use as a Priority queue where use of a dynamic array allows insertion of an unbounded number of items.|$|E
25|$|<b>Heapsort</b> is a {{much more}} {{efficient}} version of selection sort. It also works by determining the largest (or smallest) element of the list, placing that at the end (or beginning) of the list, then continuing {{with the rest of the}} list, but accomplishes this task efficiently by using a data structure called a heap, a special type of binary tree. Once the data list has been made into a heap, the root node is guaranteed to be the largest (or smallest) element. When it is removed and placed at the end of the list, the heap is rearranged so the largest element remaining moves to the root. Using the heap, finding the next largest element takes O(log n) time, instead of O(n) for a linear scan as in simple selection sort. This allows <b>Heapsort</b> to run in O(n log n) time, and this is also the worst case complexity.|$|E
25|$|<b>Heapsort</b> {{was invented}} by J. W. J. Williams in 1964. This was also {{the birth of the}} heap, {{presented}} already by Williams as a useful data structure in its own right. In the same year, R. W. Floyd published an improved version that could sort an array in-place, continuing his earlier research into the treesort algorithm.|$|E
25|$|Quicksort (sometimes called partition-exchange sort) is an {{efficient}} sorting algorithm, {{serving as a}} systematic method for placing the elements of an array in order. Developed by Tony Hoare in 1959 and published in 1961, {{it is still a}} commonly used algorithm for sorting. When implemented well, it can be about two or three times faster than its main competitors, merge sort and <b>heapsort.</b>|$|E
25|$|The <b>heapsort</b> {{algorithm}} involves {{preparing the}} list by first {{turning it into}} a max heap. The algorithm then repeatedly swaps the first value of the list with the last value, decreasing the range of values considered in the heap operation by one, and sifting the new first value into its position in the heap. This repeats until the range of considered values is one value in length.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} variation {{to the basic}} algorithm is an improvement by Floyd that uses only one comparison in each siftup run, which must {{be followed by a}} siftdown for the original child. The worst-case number of comparisons during the Floyd's heap-construction phase of <b>Heapsort</b> is known to be equal to 2N − 2s2(N) − e2(N), where s2(N) is the number of 1 bits in the binary representation of N and e2(N) is number of trailing 0 bits.|$|E
25|$|Ordinary <b>heapsort</b> {{extracts}} {{the top of}} the heap, , {{and fills}} the gap it leaves with , then sifts this latter element down the heap; but this element comes from the lowest level of the heap, meaning {{it is one of the}} smallest elements in the heap, so the sift-down will likely take many steps to move it back down. Each step of the sift-down requires two comparisons, to find the minimum of the new node and its two children.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, dynamic arrays (as well as fixed-size array data structures) allow constant-time random access, while linked lists allow only {{sequential}} access to elements. Singly linked lists, in fact, {{can be easily}} traversed in only one direction. This makes linked lists unsuitable for applications where it's useful to look up an element by its index quickly, such as <b>heapsort.</b> Sequential access on arrays and dynamic arrays is also faster than on linked lists on many machines, because they have optimal locality of reference and thus {{make good use of}} data caching.|$|E
25|$|Heaps {{where the}} parent key {{is greater than}} or equal to (≥) the child keys are called max-heaps; those where it is less than or equal to (≤) are called min-heaps. Efficient (logarithmic time) {{algorithms}} are known for the two operations needed to implement a priority queue on a binary heap: inserting an element, and removing the smallest (largest) element from a min-heap (max-heap). Binary heaps are also commonly employed in the <b>heapsort</b> sorting algorithm, which is an in-place algorithm owing to the fact that binary heaps can be implemented as an implicit data structure, storing keys in an array and using their relative positions within that array to represent child-parent relationships.|$|E
2500|$|Bottom-up <b>heapsort</b> {{requires}} only [...] comparisons {{in the worst}} case and [...] on average. [...] For comparison, ordinary <b>heapsort</b> requires [...] comparisons worst-case and on average.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Heapsort</b> also {{competes with}} merge sort, {{which has the}} same time bounds. Merge sort {{requires}} [...] auxiliary space, but <b>heapsort</b> requires only a constant amount. <b>Heapsort</b> typically runs faster in practice on machines with small or slow data caches, and does not require as much external memory. On the other hand, merge sort has several advantages over heapsort: ...|$|E
2500|$|The smoothsort {{algorithm}} is {{a variation of}} <b>heapsort</b> developed by Edsger Dijkstra in 1981. Like <b>heapsort,</b> smoothsort's upper bound is [...] The advantage of smoothsort is that it comes closer to [...] time if the input is already sorted to some degree, whereas <b>heapsort</b> averages [...] regardless of the initial sorted state. Due to its complexity, smoothsort is rarely used.|$|E
2500|$|A 2008 re-evaluation of this {{algorithm}} {{showed it}} to be no faster than ordinary <b>heapsort</b> for integer keys, though, presumably because modern branch prediction nullifies {{the cost of the}} predictable comparisons which bottom-up <b>heapsort</b> manages to avoid. [...] (It still has an advantage if comparisons are expensive.) ...|$|E
2500|$|The <b>heapsort</b> {{algorithm}} {{itself has}} [...] time complexity using either version of heapify.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Heapsort,</b> O(n log n), merge sort, introsort, {{binary tree}} sort, smoothsort, {{patience}} sorting, etc. {{in the worst}} case ...|$|E
2500|$|Thomas H. Cormen, Charles E. Leiserson, Ronald L. Rivest, and Clifford Stein. Introduction to Algorithms, Second Edition. MIT Press and McGraw-Hill, 2001[...] Chapters 6 and 7 Respectively: <b>Heapsort</b> and Priority Queues ...|$|E
2500|$|Merge sort can {{be adapted}} to operate on singly linked lists with [...] extra space. <b>Heapsort</b> {{can be adapted}} to operate on doubly linked lists with only [...] extra space overhead.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{somewhat}} slower {{in practice}} on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort, {{it has the}} advantage of a more favorable worst-case [...] runtime. [...] <b>Heapsort</b> is an in-place algorithm, {{but it is not a}} stable sort.|$|E
2500|$|Thus, {{because of}} the [...] upper bound on heapsort's running time and {{constant}} upper bound on its auxiliary storage, embedded systems with real-time constraints or systems concerned with security often use <b>heapsort,</b> such as the Linux kernel.|$|E
2500|$|Bottom-up <b>heapsort</b> instead {{finds the}} path of largest {{children}} to the leaf level of the tree (as if it were inserting −∞) using only one comparison per level. [...] Put another way, it finds the leaf which has the property that it {{and all of its}} ancestors are greater than their siblings. [...] (In the absence of equal keys, this leaf is unique.) [...] Then, from this leaf, it searches upward (using one comparison per level) for the correct position in that path to insert [...] [...] This is the same location as ordinary <b>heapsort</b> finds, and requires the same number of exchanges to perform the insert, but fewer comparisons are required to find that location.|$|E
2500|$|Insertion sort is {{a simple}} sorting {{algorithm}} that builds the final sorted array (or list) one item at a time. It is much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms such as quicksort, <b>heapsort,</b> or merge sort. However, insertion sort provides several advantages: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Heapsort</b> can be {{performed}} in place. The array can be split into two parts, the sorted array and the heap. The storage of heaps as arrays is diagrammed here. [...] The heap's invariant is preserved after each extraction, so the only cost is that of extraction.|$|E
2500|$|Levcopoulos and Petersson {{describe}} {{a variation of}} <b>heapsort</b> based on a Cartesian tree that does not add an element to the heap until smaller values {{on both sides of}} it have already been included in the sorted output. As they show, this modification can allow the algorithm to sort more quickly than [...] for inputs that are already nearly sorted.|$|E
