She was denied access to <b>her</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> father, forbidden to remarry and only allowed to walk unaccompanied within the mansion courtyard. She was, however, endowed with an income, establishment, and servants, and was allowed to ride in a carriage outside her castle, albeit under supervision.

40|$|An {{exploratory}} contextual {{study was}} undertaken {{to expand the}} insight into {{and the meaning of}} the perceptions of the mother of a hyperactive child. The phenomenological method of interviewing was used to gather data. The interviews were recorded on tape and later transcribed verbatim. The random test population consisted of eight participants who you're specially selected {{for the purpose of this}} study. Data was analysed by way of content analysis. The results firstly crystallised in the mother's experiences with <b>her</b> hyperactive <b>child</b> <b>and</b> secondly in the elements which influenced these experiences. The mothers experience is contained in her involvement with <b>her</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> in <b>her</b> interaction with Mm. She experiences vehement feelings of anger, empathy, insufficiency, guilt and depression. At the same time there is the perception that she is responsible for <b>her</b> <b>child's</b> hyperactivity <b>and</b> the accompanying behavioural problems. The mother finds herself in a stressful situation where she is a buffet between <b>her</b> <b>child</b> <b>and</b> the world. <b>Her</b> experience is influenced inter alia by her religious system, personal stress, the behaviour of the hyperactive <b>child,</b> <b>and</b> the availability of support systems...|$|R

5|$|The Bambers were financially secure. There was the farmhouse, {{property}} in London, 300 {{acres of land}} and a caravan site. Their company, N. and J.

The couple gave the children a good home and private education, but June was intensely religious and tried to force <b>her</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> grandchildren to adopt the same ideas. She had a poor relationship with Sheila, who felt June disapproved of her, and June's relationship with Jeremy was so troubled that he had apparently stopped speaking to her. Sheila's ex-husband {{was concerned about the}} effect June was having on his sons. She made them kneel and pray with her, which upset him and the boys.|$|E
