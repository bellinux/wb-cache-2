Ash was the preferred wood <b>in</b> <b>Russia</b> <b>and</b> the Baltic states, or hawthorn in Serbia, {{with a record of}} oak in Silesia.

Potential vampires were most often staked through the heart, though the mouth was targeted <b>in</b> <b>Russia</b> <b>and</b> northern Germany and the stomach in north-eastern Serbia.|$|E

5|$|Although {{numbers have}} {{declined}} steeply in western Europe, this bird is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List {{because of its}} huge range and large, apparently stable, populations <b>in</b> <b>Russia</b> <b>and</b> Kazakhstan.

Despite its elusive nature, the loud call has ensured the corn crake has been noted in literature, and garnered a range of local and dialect names.|$|E

5|$|In 1855, Tchaikovsky's father funded {{private lessons}} with Rudolph Kündinger and {{questioned}} {{him about a}} musical career for his son. While impressed with the boy's talent, Kündinger said he saw nothing to suggest a future composer or performer. He later admitted that his assessment was also based on his own negative experiences as a musician <b>in</b> <b>Russia</b> <b>and</b> his unwillingness for Tchaikovsky to be treated likewise. Tchaikovsky was told to finish his course and then try for a post in the Ministry of Justice.|$|E
