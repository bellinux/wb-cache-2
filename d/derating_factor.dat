50|$|In {{electrical}} cables {{different conditions}} govern, and installation regulations normally specify {{that the most}} severe condition along the run will govern each cable conductor's rating. Cables run in wet or oily locations may carry a lower temperature rating than in a dry installation. Derating is necessary for multiple cables in close proximity. When multiple cables are in close proximity, each contributes heat to the others and diminishes the amount of external cooling affecting the individual cable conductors. The overall ampacity of insulated cable conductors in a bundle of more than three cables must also be derated, whether in a raceway or cable.

5000|$|Shunts {{are rated}} by maximum current and voltage drop at that current. For example, a 500 A, 75 mV shunt {{would have a}} {{resistance}} of 0.15 milliohms, a maximum allowable current of 500 amps and at that current the voltage drop would be 75 millivolts. By convention, most shunts are designed to drop 50 mV, 75 mV or 100 mV when operating at their full rated current and most ammeters consist of a shunt and a voltmeter with full-scale deflections of 50, 75, or 100 mV. All shunts have a <b>derating</b> <b>factor</b> for continuous use, 66% being the most common. Continuous use is a run time of 2+ minutes, {{at which point the}} <b>derating</b> <b>factor</b> must be applied. There are thermal limits where a shunt will no longer operate correctly. At 80 °C thermal drift begins to occur, at 120 °C thermal drift is a significant problem where error, depending on the design of the shunt, can be several percent and at 140 °C the manganin alloy becomes permanently damaged due to annealing resulting in the resistance value drifting up or down. [...] If the current being measured is also at a high voltage potential this voltage will be present in the connecting leads too and in the reading instrument itself. Sometimes, the shunt is inserted in the return leg (grounded side) to avoid this problem. Some alternatives to shunts can provide isolation from the high voltage by not directly connecting the meter to the high voltage circuit. Examples of devices that can provide this isolation are Hall effect current sensors and current transformers (see clamp meters). Current shunts are considered more accurate and cheaper than Hall effect devices. Common accuracy of such devices are ±0.1% & 0.25% and 0.5%.|$|E

40|$|Ensuring {{reliable}} operation {{over an extended}} period of time is one of the biggest challenges facing present day electronic systems. The increased vulnerability of the components to atmospheric particle strikes poses a big threat in attaining the reliability required for various mission critical applications. Various soft error mitigation methodologies exist to address this reliability challenge. A general solution to this problem is to arrive at a soft error mitigation methodology with an acceptable implementation overhead and error tolerance level. This implementation overhead can then be reduced by taking advantage of various derating effects like logical derating, electrical derating and timing window derating, and/or making use of application redundancy, e. g. redundancy in firmware/software executing on the so designed robust hardware. In this paper, we analyze the impact of various <b>derating</b> <b>factors</b> and show how they can be profitably employed to reduce the hardware overhead to implement a given level of soft error robustness.

40|$|One of {{the main}} merits offered by {{multiphase}} machines is their high fault-tolerant capability. Literature has demonstrated that the performance of multiphase induction machines under fault conditions {{is affected by the}} employed stator winding connection. In open-loop controlled five-phase machines, the star connection is favorable under healthy conditions while the pentagon connection is favorable and yields a lower <b>derating</b> <b>factor</b> under the open phase condition. In this paper, a new combined star/pentagon single layer winding layout that combines the advantages of both star and pentagon connections is proposed for a five-phase induction machine. Although the proposed winding is intrinsically an asymmetrical 10 -phase machine, the proposed connection allows for only five-phase terminals. Moreover, the proposed winding not only yields better flux distribution compared to a conventional single layer winding, but also provides a complete cancellation of the third order harmonic flux component caused by the induced third sequence currents due to the saturation effect and/or under unbalanced operation. Hence, the machine losses are decreased, which improves the overall machine efficiency. For the healthy case, the machine is similar to a conventional star connected five-phase machine. However, with one phase open, the proposed connection results in a lower <b>derating</b> <b>factor</b> compared to conventional connections for both open-loop and optimal current control techniques.

Synchronous motors when fed from a power system polluted with harmonic voltages will exhibit harmonic rotating fluxes.

The backward rotating fluxes (produced by the negative sequence harmonic voltages) produce braking torques. Harmonic voltages and the associated currents and fluxes result in additional copper and iron losses. Therefore, the motors, which are fed from polluted-voltage supply, should be derated otherwise the motor temperature would exceed its rated value.
