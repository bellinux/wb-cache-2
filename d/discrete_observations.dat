50|$|In {{somewhat}} more familiar terms, Rasch models {{provide a basis}} and justification for obtaining person locations on a continuum from total scores on assessments. Although {{it is not uncommon}} to treat total scores directly as measurements, they are actually counts of <b>discrete</b> <b>observations</b> rather than measurements. Each observation represents the observable outcome of a comparison between a person and item. Such outcomes are directly analogous to the observation of the rotation of a balance scale in one direction or another. This observation would indicate that one or other object has a greater mass, but counts of such observations cannot be treated directly as measurements.|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a new aspect of a risk process, which is a macro approximation {{of the flow of}} a risk reserve. We assume that the underlying process consists of a Brownian motion plus negative jumps, and that the process is observed at discrete time points. In our context, each jump size of the process does not necessarily correspond to the each claim size. Therefore our risk process is different from the traditional risk process. We cannot directly observe each jump size because of <b>discrete</b> <b>observations.</b> Our goal is to estimate the adjustment coefficient of our risk process from <b>discrete</b> <b>observations.</b> Risk process Diffusion perturbations <b>Discrete</b> <b>observations</b> Adjustment coefficients Statistical inference...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{problem of}} {{observation}} space reordering {{is presented as}} a novel approach to pattern recognition based on non-parametric, combinatorial statistical tests. It consists in linearly ordering the elements of a <b>discrete</b> multi-dimensional <b>observation</b> space along a curve such that elements belonging to different similarity classes are as close to each other as possible, the similarity classes are mutually separated, and the length of the curve is kept to minimum. The problem is NP-difficult and it is shown how its approximate solution can be reached by a series of transformations improving the initial lexicographic linear order of a <b>discrete</b> <b>observation</b> space. Recommendations are formulated for linear order improvement leading to a pattern recognition algorithm based on serial statistical test...|$|R
40|$|We {{consider}} a nonparametric {{goodness of fit}} test problem for the drift coefficient of one-dimensional small diffusions. Our test is based on <b>discrete</b> <b>observation</b> of the processes, and the diffusion coefficient is a nuisance function which is estimated in our testing procedure. We prove that the limit distribution of our test is the supremum of the standard Brownian motion, and thus our test is asymptotically distribution free.

In this paper, we study parameter estimation problems for nonergodic OU processes driven by the weighted fractional Brownian motion with <b>discrete</b> <b>observations.</b> We construct two estimators, then prove {{the consistency of the}} estimators and get their rate consistency. By comparing ElOnsy, Es-Sebaiy, and Ndiaye [22] with our paper, we obtain both the consistency of the estimators and their rate consistency.

The {{purpose of this}} article is to estimate integral-type functionals of the Lvy measures from <b>discrete</b> <b>observations.</b> We propose two types of estimators: kernel-type and empirical-type estimators, both of which are obtained by direct discretization from asymptotically efficient estimators of the target based on continuous observations.

40|$|Directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) play a {{large role}} in the modern {{approach}} to causal inference. DAGs describe the relationship between measurements taken at various discrete times including the effect of interventions. The causal mechanisms, on the other hand, would naturally be assumed to be a continuous process operating over time in a cause-effect fashion. How does such immediate causation, that is causation occurring over very short time intervals, relate to DAGs constructed from <b>discrete</b> <b>observations?</b> We introduce a time-continuous model and simulate <b>discrete</b> <b>observations</b> in order to judge the relationship between the DAG and the immediate causal model. We find that there is no clear relationship; indeed the Bayesian network described by the DAG may not relate to the causal model. Typically, <b>discrete</b> <b>observations</b> of a process will obscure the conditional dependencies that are represented in the underlying mechanistic model of the process. It is therefore doubtful whether DAGs are always suited to describe causal relationships unless time is explicitly considered in the model. We relate the issues to mechanistic modeling by using the concept of local (in) dependence. An example using data from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study is presented...|$|E

A simple method for estimating the local time from high-frequency <b>discrete</b> time <b>observations</b> yielding control of the L 2 error is proposed. Complemented by a finite element implementation this enables error-control for a fixed random sample {{all the way from}} high-frequency <b>discrete</b> <b>observation</b> to the numerical computation of the posterior mean and covariance.
