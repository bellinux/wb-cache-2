5|$|As they {{stake out}} their territories and compete for females, males exhibit rivalry. When they clash, they {{face up to}} each other with bent knees and {{exchange}} horn thrusts. Elaborate individual displays are made during their rivalry and they may bellow, snort and dig their horns into the ground. Once dominance has been established, each male attempts to lure the female into his domain. During courtship, urination and low-stretch are common activities and the male soon attempts to mount the female. A receptive female holds her tail {{to one side and}} stands still while copulation takes place. Matings may be repeated several times and may take place twice or more times within a minute. The male neither eats nor rests when a female is present in his territory and during this time, the female keeps close to the male, often rubbing <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> his torso and sniffing his penis. While in season, a female may visit several territories and mate with several different males.|$|E
5|$|Jared {{initially}} {{tells the}} police nothing {{of what he}} saw. He is torn between the need {{to tell the truth}} and the desire to protect his friends; his anger leads to the breakdown of his relationships with both Rachel and Diane. Despite Jared's silence, police arrest Toby and the three other boys within a few days. Jared decides to tell the police what he saw, as he believes Toby and the other boys will be charged with Tracy's murder; however, on his way into the police station he is confronted by Ricko. Ricko confesses to Jared that he killed Tracy, but claims it was an accident – that she hit <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> a rock when he attempted to have sex with her. He has already told police that he was with Jared all night and asks Jared to confirm his alibi in the name of mateship. Diane, who still {{has not been able to}} tell Jared that she has cancer due to his behaviour, goes in to have surgery.|$|E

5|$|The video {{begins as}} the protagonist parks {{her car and}} cries {{following}} an argument she has had with her lover. She then leaves the car, walks towards the sea, and lets down her hair. Flashbacks of {{the woman and her}} lover on the beach are shown. With teary eyes, she heads into the sea as waves break the shore. Back in the car, she imagines her lover holding her hands. The video transitions into color, as Beyoncé's character appears on the beach in a green dress and holds a rose without its petals, which she later restores. The video then flashes back to black-and-white memories of the woman resting <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> her lover's shoulder. She eventually realizes that she must set her relationship back on the right track. In the end, she drives off with a smile.|$|E

25|$|A day later, on Saturday, August 25, Rolling {{broke into}} the {{apartment}} where 18-year-old Christa Hoyt lived by prying open a sliding glass door with a KA-BAR knife and a screwdriver, {{but she was not}} home.

As in the Powell murder, he forced her face-down and stabbed her in the back, rupturing her heart. He then decapitated the body and posed <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> a shelf facing the corpse, adding to the shock of whoever discovered her.|$|E
25|$|At the Australian Open Li Na easily stormed {{through to}} the quarterfinals, where she faced world No. 4 Agnieszka Radwańska, who had not dropped a set during a 13-match winning streak. Li became {{the first player to}} defeat her this season and {{advanced}} to the semifinals where she ousted world No. 2 Maria Sharapova in straight sets, who had only dropped a record-low nine games in the tournament. This marked Li's second Australian Open final appearance in three years, finishing runner-up to Kim Clijsters in 2011. In the final, Li was hampered by injuries, falling over on two occasions. The first of which occurred at 1–3 in the second set, a fall that saw Li incur a 10-minute medical timeout. She fell over a second time after the Australia Day fireworks break, not only twisting her left ankle once more but also heavily knocking the rear of <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> the court, causing a momentary black-out. Despite being severely hindered in her movement, she continued playing but eventually lost the match in three sets to Victoria Azarenka.|$|E

25|$|However, in 1882 R. Mowat {{published}} an inscription in which Fortuna is called daughter of Jupiter, raising new questions and opening new perspectives in {{the theology of}} Latin gods. Dumézil has elaborated an interpretative theory according to which this aporia would be an intrinsic, fundamental feature of Indoeuropean deities of the primordial and sovereign level, as it finds a parallel in Vedic religion. The contradiction would put Fortuna both at the origin of time and into its ensuing diachronic process: it is the comparison offered by Vedic deity Aditi, the Not-Bound or Enemy of Bondage, that shows {{that there is no}} question of choosing one of the two apparent options: as the mother of the Aditya she has the same type of relationship with one of his sons, Dakṣa, the minor sovereign who represents the Creative Energy, being at the same time his mother and daughter, as is true for the whole group of sovereign gods to which she belongs. Moreover, Aditi is thus one of the heirs (along with Savitr) of the opening god of the Indoiranians, as she is represented with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>on</b> her two sides, with the two faces looking opposite directions. The mother of the sovereign gods has thence two solidal but distinct modalities of duplicity, i.e. of having two foreheads and a double position in the genealogy. Angelo Brelich has interpreted this theology as the basic opposition between the primordial absence of order (chaos) and the organisation of the cosmos.|$|E

However, when he again appealed against his conviction, Moore's version of events that Boycott had attacked her by punching her in the face, causing bruising, was upheld, {{in the light of}} photographs of her injuries shown to the court and the testimony of a doctor that the injuries could not have been caused in the way described by Boycott.|$|E
