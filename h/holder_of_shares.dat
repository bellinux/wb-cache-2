One had been a medical man who, unfortunately, was left money and took to speculating on the Stock Exchange. He was a very large <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> in a South African mine, which he bought at 1s. 6d. These shares now stand at £7; but, unhappily for him, his brokers dissolved partnership, and neither of them would carry over his account. So it was closed down just at the wrong time, with the result that he lost everything, and finally came to the streets. He never drank or did anything wrong; it was, as he said, 'simply a matter of sheer bad luck.' ...|$|E

40|$|Economic theory {{points to}} five parties active in disciplining {{management}} of poorly performing firms: <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> large <b>share</b> blocks, acquirers <b>of</b> new blocks, bidders in take-overs, non-executive directors, and investors {{during periods of}} financial distress. This Paper reports the first comparative evaluation {{of the role of}} these different parties in the discipline of management. We find that, in the UK, most parties, including <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> substantial <b>share</b> blocks, exert little discipline and that some, for example, inside <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> <b>share</b> blocks and boards dominated by non-executive directors, actually impede it. Bidders replace a high proportion of management of companies acquired in take-overs but do not target poorly performing management. In contrast, during periods of financial constraints prompting distressed rights issues and capital restructuring, investors focus control on poorly performing companies. These results stand in contrast to the US, where there is little evidence of a role for new equity issues but non-executive directors and acquirers <b>of</b> <b>share</b> blocks perform a disciplinary function.

40|$|The problem {{related to}} the {{privatization}} of State–Owned Corporations is as an urgent issue recently. It is as the effect of nationality assets as the target of privatization which is frequently debated as {{the existence of the}} policy to sell some state owned corporations for the foreigners. In other words, the problem occurs in the privatization of State Owned Corporations as the impact of government policy without considering the needs of the people in general. The problem to raise in this thesis is related to rule governing the privatization of State Owned Corporations, legal aspects of state financial in privatization of State Owned Corporations, and the state financial condition in State Owned Corporations which have been privatized. The method used in this research was normative yuridical. Normative research method was also called as doctrinal research, that is the research to analyze law either law as it is written in the book or law it is decided by the judge through judicial process. Normative law research was based on secondary data and emphasized on the steps of speculative-theoretical and normative-quantitative analysis. The privatization program is intended to increase the performance and valued-added of the company as well as to add the participation {{of the people in the}} possession of company shares. The privatization was done by paying attention on the principles of transparencies, self-support, accountability, responsibility, and reasonably. The privatization can be done by selling shares based on capital market clauses, share direct selling for investors, and share selling for management and/or related employees. State financial in State Owned Corporations is as different wealthy from the wealthy of state and with the rights to get profit from the results of the company. The wealthy of the state in one State Owned Corporation depends on the type of the corporations. If the type of State Owned Corporations are in Public Company, then all capital shall be owned to state. However, if it is in the form of limited company, then partly of the capital (at least 51 %) shall be as the asset of state and it is divided on the shares. State Owned Corporations which have been privatized in fact shall transfer partly of state shares (represented by government) on the state financial in State Owned Corporations which have been privatized to private parties and the possession of shares will be smaller than 50 %. It means that new investors as the <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> in State Owned Corporations which have been privatized may get partly of shares in State Owned Corporations. As the biggest shareholders, new investors shall try hard and efficiently to get optimal profit, absorb new workers and give more contribution for the government through tax payment and dividend division.

50|$|The capital <b>shares</b> <b>of</b> a split <b>share</b> {{corporation}} {{are intended}} to be a more aggressive investment vehicle, one that can provide both high income and the promise of amplified capital gains compared to the capital gains of the underlying basket <b>of</b> <b>shares.</b> In effect, the <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> capital <b>shares</b> are borrowing money from the <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> the preferred <b>shares</b> at the dividend rate <b>of</b> the preferred <b>shares,</b> and investing that money in a greater number <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> in the underlying basket <b>of</b> <b>shares.</b> Capital gains (or losses) are amplified in the capital shares because the value <b>of</b> the preferred <b>shares</b> is held relatively constant, and the resulting increased volatility of the equity in the underlying basket <b>of</b> <b>shares</b> is borne mostly by the capital <b>shares.</b> <b>Holders</b> <b>of</b> the capital <b>shares</b> take on their obligation to guarantee dividend payments to the <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> the preferred <b>shares</b> in exchange for amplified returns. In addition, the income from the capital shares can be structured to be treatable, for tax purposes, as mostly or even entirely capital gain. In many jurisdictions, such as Canada, capital gains are taxed at a lower rate than either dividend income or interest income.|$|R

Previous literature suggests that volatility is positively related to discount size, but we find some opposite. We infer that SOEs as <b>holder</b> <b>of</b> restricted <b>shares</b> do not price risk as the market does. In the end, two components composed of theoretical discount are identified and measured based on our extended theoretical model. Besides the basic component from devaluation in restricted shares, an extra component from huge borrowing in liquid benchmark contributes a big proportion of theoretical illiquidity discount.

These two classes of stock had the same voting, cash flow, and all other legal rights except that non-tradable shares cannot be transferred at the open markets. From 2005, China implemented the reform to convert all non-tradable shares into tradable. In this reform process, the <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> non-tradable <b>shares</b> had to negotiate with their tradable counterparts {{to determine how much}} liquidity premium, or the compensation ratio, to pay the <b>holders</b> <b>of</b> tradable <b>shares</b> in order to obtain the liquidity right.

We exploit a company-level data set to measure the price reaction of each company to both the announcement of the details of the reform and the implementation of the compensation plan, using information about the timing of suspension from trading and subsequent readmission of each stock. The setup of the reform process is useful to disentangle the relative roles of information and supply. After studying empirical asset pricing models for the Chinese stock market, we measure abnormal returns and analyze both their time series and their cross sectional properties. We find that the reform process is characterized by positive abnormal returns before the increase in supply; we also find evidence in favor of a negatively sloped demand function.
