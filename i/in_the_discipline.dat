5|$|During his studies, Wheeler had {{developed}} {{his love of}} archaeology, having joined an excavation of Viroconium Cornoviorum, a Romano-British settlement in Wroxeter, in 1913. Considering a profession <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discipline,</b> he won a studentship that had been established jointly by the University of London and the Society of Antiquaries in memory of Augustus Wollaston Franks. The prominent archaeologist Sir Arthur Evans doubled {{the amount of money}} that went with the studentship. Wheeler's proposed project had been to analyse Romano-Rhenish pottery, and with the grant he funded a trip to the Rhineland in Germany, there studying the Roman pottery housed in local museums; his research into this subject was never published.|$|E

5|$|Wheeler is {{recognised}} {{as one of}} {{the most}} important British archaeologists of the twentieth century, responsible for successfully encouraging British public interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discipline</b> and advancing methodologies of excavation and recording.

5|$|Froome, who {{had been}} second in the 2011 and 2014 Vueltas, had had a strong season, with {{victories}} in the , the Critérium du Dauphiné and the Tour de France. He was attempting {{to become the first}} rider since Bernard Hinault in 1978 to win both the Tour and the Vuelta in the same season, though it was expected that he would be tired following his victory in the Tour. The individual time trial was expected to favour Froome, who is strong <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discipline.</b> Before the race, however, Froome was uncertain about his form and his ability to win the race. Quintana's only stage race victory of the season had come in the Tirreno–Adriatico, but he had performed strongly in the Alps in the Tour's final stages, and the mountainous route of the Vuelta was expected to suit him.|$|E

5|$|The first {{sociology}} {{department to}} be established in the United Kingdom was at the London School of Economics and Political Science (home of the British Journal of Sociology) in 1904. Leonard Trelawny Hobhouse and Edvard Westermarck became the lecturers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discipline</b> at the University of London in 1907. Harriet Martineau, an English translator of Comte, has been cited as the first female sociologist. In 1909 the Deutsche Gesellschaft für Soziologie (German Sociological Association) was founded by Ferdinand Tönnies and Max Weber, among others. Weber established the first department in Germany at the Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich in 1919, having presented an influential new antipositivist sociology. In 1920, Florian Znaniecki set up the first department in Poland. The Institute for Social Research at the University of Frankfurt (later to become the Frankfurt School of critical theory) was founded in 1923. International co-operation in sociology began in 1893, when René Worms founded the , an institution later eclipsed by the much larger International Sociological Association (ISA), founded in 1949.|$|E

25|$|Many {{art historians}} use {{critical}} theory to frame their inquiries into objects. Theory {{is most often}} used when dealing with more recent objects, those from the late 19th century onward.

Feminist, Marxist, critical race, queer, and postcolonial theories are all well established <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discipline.</b> As in literary studies, there is an interest among scholars in nature and the environment, but the direction that this will take <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>discipline</b> has yet to be determined.|$|E
