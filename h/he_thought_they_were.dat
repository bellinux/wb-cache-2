5|$|Education in Zimbabwe became {{under threat}} since the {{economic}} changes in 2000 with teachers going on strike {{because of low}} pay, students unable to concentrate because of hunger {{and the price of}} uniforms soaring making this standard a luxury.

5|$|In 1992, Raël {{appeared}} on Ciel mon Mardi, a French talk show hosted by journalist Christophe Dechavanne. Toward {{the end of}} the show, Raël's liberal views on sex were critiqued by a priest, a social worker, and a psychologist. A former Raëlian named Jean Parraga believed that his wife and children were being held as prisoners and that Raël attempted to break up his family. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> being treated like criminals in activities such as orgies and sacrifice involving children at the Sensual Meditation camp. Parraga also had a criminal record as a drug dealer and car thief, and in August 1992, he attempted to shoot Raël.|$|E

5|$|The current taxonomic {{arrangement}} of the Banksia genus is based on botanist Alex George's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series. In this arrangement, B.canei is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia, because its inflorescences {{take the form of}} Banksias characteristic flower spikes; section Banksia because of its straight styles; and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical. Kevin Thiele placed it in a subseries Integrifoliae, where he found strong support for it and B.saxicola to be each other's closest relative. The two were a sister group (i.e. next closest relative) to the four then-recognised subspecies of B.integrifolia. The subseries all bear whorled leaves apart from B.canei and B.aquilonia. However, this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George. He did place the two subalpine taxa (B.canei and B.saxicola) {{at the end of the}} sequence as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> the most recently evolved species, since he considered the group to have a tropical origin and B.dentata to be the oldest lineage.|$|E

25|$|Merlo, {{who claims}} {{it was a}} {{kidnapping}} orchestrated by SIDE, had traveled to Mexico to meet with Mexican politicians of the PRD, who were cooperating in an international push to free the guerrillas responsible for the La Tablada attack who were, and still are, serving prison term in Argentine jails. Merlo arrived in the Mexican capital with a fake Uruguayan passport, where he soon realized that the Mexican security forces were following him. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> just doing basic surveillance on him {{to see if he}} was doing any illegal activity in Mexican territory.|$|E

25|$|A week later, the family's quiet {{evening is}} {{interrupted}} by the unexpected arrival of Tancredi, who has brought a friend with him (Count Carlo). Tancredi and the Count, in their full dress uniforms, fascinate the Prince's daughters and puzzle the Prince, who says <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> still fighting for Garibaldi. Tancredi and the Count react with disgust, saying {{there was no way}} they could stay with such a rough outfit when positions with the new king's army were available. Tancredi then produces the ring he has purchased for Angelica. A moment later, Angelica rushes in, having been informed by a note that Tancredi is back. The lovers embrace; sensuality fills the air.|$|E
25|$|Around Thanksgiving Sarah calls Bob {{and they}} go to a hotel and have sex. In the morning Bob is rude to Sarah and during the drive home Sarah realizes that he really did sleep with June.

Meanwhile, Jake is talked into taking Sherry to see Doctor Zhivago. Sarah notices Jake leaving the theater afterward, but while discussing the film with him she notices Sherry and realizes the two of them are on a date. Sarah flees again, and when Sherry asks Jake up to her apartment, he declines and instead walks home.|$|E
25|$|Ocean and Calcutta left Portsmouth on 27 April 1803 {{and reached}} Santa Cruz on the Island of Tenerife, {{part of the}} Canary Islands on 17 May 1803. Both ships sailed from Tenerife on 21 May and arrived at Rio de Janeiro in Brazil on 29 June. While in Rio, Captain Woodriff of Calcutta sent five marines under Lieutenant Sladden to help {{maintain}} order on the Ocean {{for the rest of}} the voyage. According to Reverend Robert Knopwood's journals, ‘Mr. Hartley, a settler had behaved badly’ – and it seemed there was little love lost between some of the free settlers and Captain Mertho. They apparently regarded him as a tyrant, while <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> intractable.|$|E

Eno selected them on the basis that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> incompatible with each other musically. He stated that he [...] "got them together merely because I wanted to see what happens when you combine different identities like that and allow them to compete... is organized with the knowledge that there might be accidents, accidents which will be more interesting than what I had intended".|$|E
500|$|In {{the music}} video, Usher, Bieber and Butler all portray {{themselves}} as the latter two are at Usher's house playing video games. Bieber receives {{a phone call from}} Usher, in which he asks him if could he watch the house until he gets back. After agreeing, Bieber holds a house party and tries to get close to one girl in particular, played by Kristen Rodeheaver, but is disappointed because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> bonding {{but at the end of}} the video when they are sitting together at the pool, she kisses him on the cheek, then leaves. Originally, Rodeheaver and Bieber were supposed to hold hands and jump into the pool, but it was too cold. [...] He then stands up and gets caught by Usher.|$|E
500|$|Since Dexter {{producers}} try {{to shield}} the child actors {{as much as possible}} from the show's dark subject matter, executive producer Daniel Cerone urged the mother of his son's friend not to let her son audition to play a young Dexter, who is filmed sitting in a pool of blood. Erik King found the shot of the boy crying in the blood to be the creepiest moment of the first season. He described it as [...] "very uncomfortable to watch, even when you know it's not real and you know these kids are actors." [...] Cinematographer Romeo Tirone tightened the camera's shutter angle when filming these scenes to make them [...] "feel like fragments of memory - subjective, with tight close-ups against an indistinct background. You don't see all the details of the environment." [...] Series director Keith Gordon found these flashbacks [...] "incredible" [...] because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> [...] "like a Stanley Kubrick movie".|$|E

500|$|Cooper {{was one of}} the {{founding}} members of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, a conservative organization dedicated, according to its statement of principles, to preserving the [...] "American way of life" [...] and opposing communism and fascism. The organization — whose membership included Walter Brennan, Laraine Day, Walt Disney, Clark Gable, Hedda Hopper, Ronald Reagan, Barbara Stanwyck, and John Wayne — advised the United States Congress to investigate communist influence in the motion picture industry. On October 23, 1947, Cooper appeared before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) and was asked if he had observed any [...] "communistic influence" [...] in Hollywood. Cooper recounted statements he'd heard suggesting that the Constitution was out of date and that Congress was an unnecessary institution—comments that Cooper said he found to be [...] "very un-American". He also testified that he had rejected several scripts because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> [...] "tinged with communist ideas". Unlike some other witnesses, Cooper did not name any individuals during his testimony.|$|E
500|$|The {{secondary}} plot line, {{about the}} auditions for New Directions soloist at Nationals, was roundly criticized. Canning {{called it a}} [...] "faux drama", though he added that Jesse was [...] "a delight to despise", and VanDerWerff said it was [...] "completely ridiculous {{to do this with}} Nationals coming up" [...] in a week's time, and [...] "constructed almost entirely" [...] to make Jesse a [...] "jerk". Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson also hit on the lack of preparation for the upcoming competition and stated that it seemed [...] "like a very bad idea" [...] to be going without a setlist already decided on, much less with songs unwritten. He said the four audition numbers were [...] "awkwardly paced", though <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> [...] "fantastic"; Reiter said they [...] "stood out like glinting gems in a somewhat muddy episode". Canning and VanDerWerff also criticized the block of four songs {{in the middle of the}} episode which, as VanDerWerff put it, [...] "stops the show cold". James Poniewozik of Time was unhappy for another reason altogether: [...] "Having four people stand up and sing solos into a microphone may be music; but it ain't a musical." ...|$|E
500|$|Reception of [...] "The Food Wife" [...] {{from food}} critics has been mixed. Before the episode aired, Robert Sietsema of The Village Voice disapproved {{of it for}} being outdated. He commented that [...] "this show should have been done, say, {{two or three years}} ago, when food {{blogging}} was hot. By now, many food bloggers of our acquaintance have out-migrated to paying gigs, and the concept of the food blog has been co-opted by every major media outlet, rendering real food blogs – the old-fashioned kind, where someone stood alone in their kitchen cooking things, or wandered the hinterlands seeking out unique deliciousness – nearly obsolete." [...] Sietsema also criticized the scenes showcasing molecular gastronomy because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> out of date, since molecular gastronomy is, [...] "by now, long past its prime". Chris Shott, a food critic for Washington City Papers Young & Hungry column and blog, wrote negatively about the character that owns El Chemistri and is a parody of José Andrés. He commented that [...] "For one thing, the character seems far more subdued than the kooky, wild-eyed power drill-wielding cook we saw on Conan recently. The satire here, involving a deconstructed Caesar salad of foams, gels and airs, is more a riff on molecular gastronomy in general than a send-up of Andrés' over-the-top personality." ...|$|E
60|$|Lord Emsworth smiled. Scarabs, of course. You couldn't collect Arabs.

2500|$|About 30 {{seconds after}} seeing the first flash of light, Arnold saw a series of bright flashes in the {{distance}} off to his left, or north of Mt.

The reflections came from flying objects. They flew in a long chain, and Arnold for a moment considered <b>they</b> might <b>be</b> a flock of geese, but quickly ruled this out {{for a number of}} reasons, including the altitude, bright glint, and obviously very fast speed. <b>He</b> then <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> might <b>be</b> a new type of jet and started looking intently for a tail and was surprised that he couldn't find any.|$|R

It was his first introduction to the letters of the alphabet, and he was over ten years old.|$|R
2500|$|Historian Chowdhury {{says that}} the {{condition}} of Hindus during his reign was [...] "also good" [...] as [...] "they became more rich"(sic). Though Quli Khan was a Muslim, Hindus were employed in the tax department primarily because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> experts in the field; they could also speak fluent Persian. However, if they were found guilty of cheating, Quli Khan imposed harsh punishments compared to those imposed upon Muslims.|$|E
2500|$|At 02:15, five British {{ships of}} the 13th Destroyer Flotilla under Captain James Uchtred Farie regrouped and headed south. At 02:25, they sighted {{the rear of}} the German line. [...] inquired of the leader [...] as to whether <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> British or German ships. Answering that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>they</b> <b>were</b> German, Farie then veered off to the east and away from the German line. All but Moresby in the rear followed, as through the gloom she sighted what she thought were four pre-dreadnought battleships [...] away. She hoisted a flag signal {{indicating}} that the enemy was to the west and then closed to firing range, letting off a torpedo set for high running at 02:37, then veering off to rejoin her flotilla. The four pre-dreadnought battleships were in fact two pre-dreadnoughts, Schleswig-Holstein and , and the battlecruisers Von der Tann and Derfflinger. Von der Tann sighted the torpedo and was forced to steer sharply to starboard to avoid it as it passed close to her bows. Moresby rejoined Champion convinced she had scored a hit.|$|E
2500|$|After Manly {{had been}} {{knocked out of}} the finals series, Paul Vautin made his {{television}} commentary début during the 1988 NSWRL Grand Final with the ABC alongside long time caller David Morrow.

5|$|Additions {{to the end}} musical number, {{including}} visual gags such as Bob {{appearing in}} uniform, were added after the animatics.
