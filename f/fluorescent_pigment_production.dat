Use of the defined pyocyanine medium of Frank and DeMoss with sulfate or various organic sulfur sources allowed formation of pyocyanine, related phenazines, and pyorubrin. When sulfite was the sulfur source with or without iron, P. aeruginosa formed either a yellow-green or a blue <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigment.</b> Formation of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigments</b> of P. aeruginosa is related to the ability of sulfite to act as a specific sulfur source.

40|$|Fluorescent Pseudomonas strains were {{isolated}} from 38 undisturbed pristine soil samples from 10 sites on four continents. A total of 248 isolates were confirmed as Pseudomonas sensu stricto by <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigment</b> <b>production</b> and group-specific 16 S ribosomal DNA (rDNA) primers. These isolates {{were analyzed by}} three molecular typing methods with different levels of resolution: 16 S rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), 16 S- 23 S rDNA intergenic spacer-restriction fragment length polymorphism (ITS-RFLP) analysis, and repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR genomic fingerprinting with a BOX primer set (BOX-PCR). All isolates showed very similar ARDRA patterns, as expected. Some ITS-RFLP types were also found at every geographic scale, although some ITS-RFLP types were unique {{to the site of}} origin, indicating weak endemicity at this level of resolution. Using a similarity value of 0. 8 or more after cluster analysis of BOX-PCR fingerprinting patterns to define the same genotypes, we identified 85 unique fluorescent Pseudomonas genotypes in our collection. There were no overlapping genotypes between sites as well as continental regions, indicating strict site endemism. The genetic distance between isolates as determined by degree of dissimilarity in BOX-PCR patterns was meaningfully correlated to the geographic distance between the isolates' sites of origin. Also, a significant positive spatial autocorrelation of the distribution of the genotypes was observed among distances of < 197 km, and significant negative autocorrelation was observed between regions. Hence, strong endemicity of fluorescent Pseudomonas genotypes was observed, suggesting that these heterotrophic soil bacteria are not globally mixed...|$|E
40|$|Two {{reporter}} systems, lacZY and luxAB, were stably {{integrated into}} the chromosome of Pseudomonas aeruginosa UG 2, a biosurfactant-producing strain. Growth and rhamnolipid production of the UG 2 wild-type and reporter gene-bearing UG 2 L strains were similar in liquid culture. A spontaneous rifampin-resistant detecting UG 2 Lr, allowed antibiotic selection. Phenotypic characteristics were compared for usefulness in detecting UG 2 Lr colonies: morphology, <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigment</b> <b>production,</b> light emission (lux), X-Gal (5 -bromo- 4 -chloro- 3 -indolyl-beta-D-galactopyranoside) cleavage (lac), and rifampin resistance. Survival patterns of UG 2, UG 2 L, and UG 2 Lr strains were similar in sandy loam soil microcosms over 12 12 weeks. The lac marker was not suitable for monitoring P. aeruginosa UG 2 Lr in soil since 20 to 42 % of cultured, aerobic, heterotrophic soil microorganisms formed blue, lactose-positive colonies. The lux genes provided a stable and unequivocal reporter system, as effective as conventional antibiotic plating, for tracking microorganisms nonselectively at 10 (3) CFU/g of soil. Three months after inoculation into oil-contaminated and uncontaminated soil microcosms, UG 2 Lr cells were recovered at 10 (7) and 10 (4) cells per g (dry weight) of soil, respectively. Detection by PCR amplification of part of the luxA gene confirmed a decrease in UG 2 Lr cell numbers in uncontaminated soil.

40|$|A novel microbial-screening {{procedure}} {{was developed for}} separate detection of 1, 4 -butanediol, ethylene glycol, and adipic acid, three commercially important oxychemicals potentially derivable from bacterial omega-oxidation of n-butanol, ethanol, and hexanoic acid, respectively. The screening method involved postproduction addition of one of several specific Pseudomonas strains which produce a soluble <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigment</b> during growth on the product of interest. A mutation and selection {{procedure was}} developed for isolation of specific strains with phenotypes for growth and <b>pigment</b> <b>production</b> on the desired product (e. g., 1, 4 -butanediol), but not on its bioconversion substrate (e. g., n-butanol), common by-products (e. g., n-butyrate), or product isomers. <b>Pigment</b> <b>production</b> was growth associated and required cultivation of the screening strains under limiting Fe 3 + concentrations. The pigments resembled well-characterized, iron-chelating siderophores produced by other fluorescent pseudomonads. The sensitivity of the assay for product accumulation was enhanced by (i) conducting the screening in microtiter dishes to permit examination of individual isolates of putative producers and to control product diffusion, (ii) using a wavelength cutoff filter to reduce background source light, and (iii) using adapted screening strains which grew at lower (0. 3 mM) concentrations of test compounds.

40|$|The {{saltwater}} crocodile (Crocodylus porosus) is extensively farmed for their skin and meat. In order to optimise growth rates and production crocodiles {{need to be}} fed an optimal diet, based on their nutritional physiology.

Plastic beads, pieces of flagging tape and a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>pigment</b> were used as digestive markers, to evaluate whether these markers are suitable as digestive markers in C. porosus.

Bacteriol. 90 : 1686 – 1691. 1965. —A microorganism {{was isolated}} from the soil near the University of North Dakota. Biochemical and morphological characteristics indicated that this organism would best be classified {{as a member of}} the family Achromobacteraceae, genus Achromobacter, species unknown. The organism produced a red pigment when grown in a medium containing yeast extract and tryptophan. The pH optimum for <b>pigment</b> <b>production</b> was about 8. 0 and the optimal temperature was 25 C. During a study of the nutritional requirements for growth and <b>pigment</b> <b>production,</b> it was found that the organism would grow and produce pigment in a medium containing tryptophan and nucleosides, but the rate of both growth and pigment formation in this medium was slower than that observed with tryptophan and yeast extract. The organism grew well in the presence of acid-hydrolyzed casein and nucleosides without producing pigment, indicating that the pigment is not necessary for growth. Resting-cell experiments definitely established tryptophan as the sole exogenous requirement for <b>pigment</b> <b>production.</b> The <b>pigment</b> was extracted from yeast extract-tryptophan medium with chloroform. Thin layer chromatographic analysis of the crude pigment extracted from this medium revealed the presence of two other pigments in addition to the major red pigment. One of these was a highly <b>fluorescent</b> orange <b>pigment</b> and the other a pink pigment. Only the red pigment was produced by resting cells in the presence of tryptophan alone. This pigment served as an electron acceptor when coupled with formic dehydrogenase, indicating its possible function as an oxidation-reduction pigment.
