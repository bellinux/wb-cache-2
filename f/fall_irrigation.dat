A study was initiated in 1987 to assess the effectiveness of grid drainage to intercept canal and natural groundwater seepage and reclaim the resulting saline affected land. Using a groundwater flow model, MODFLOW, {{it was found that}} a single deep interceptor drain would have failed to intercept all canal seepage and maintain the water table downslope of the canal below the 1. 0 m design water table depth. Conversely, simulations indicated that with a grid drainage system, all canal and natural groundwater seepage would be intercepted and the water table would remain below the design water table depth, with or without irrigation recharge that would maintain a steady state salt balance.

40|$|There {{are large}} gaps in our {{understanding}} of the hydrology of forested uplands, wetlands and ponds on the western Boreal Plain region of Canada (Buttle et al. 2005; Devito et al. 2005). Recent climatic conditions have resulted in the drying of ponds and wetlands within this region. The long-term sustainability of these wetland ecosystems likely requires runoff inputs from adjacent upland forest hillslopes. Snowmelt is a critical water source on the Boreal Plain as it comprises 30 â€“ 40 % of annual precipitation inputs, occurs when plant uptake is minimal and may result in runoff over frozen soils. The objective of this research was to examine the potential for snowmelt runoff from forested hillslopes at the Utikuma Research Study Area (URSA) on the Boreal Plain of north central Alberta. To understand the potential for snowmelt runoff in this region, it is necessary to examine the major controls over snowmelt water movement. The variables examined include: aspect (N, S) which controls energy input for melt, soil texture (sand, loam) which influences storage and transmission of water, and frozen soil moisture content (<b>fall</b> <b>irrigation,</b> non-irrigated) which determines the infiltrability of frozen soils.

40|$|SUMMARY. Seepage may be {{prevented}} {{to some extent}} by employing proper methods of irrigation. Overirrigation may {{have a tendency to}} water-log the soil. A small head of water, properly used, will irrigate more land and do better work than a large head gone over the land hurriedly. The distance of irrigation ditches should be such that the water may travel between the ditches in about two hours. If land can be irrigated in the fall with the same care that crops are irrigated in the summer, there is an advantage to <b>fall</b> <b>irrigation.</b> If water cannot be properly cared for and this irrigation is uneven, it is a detriment rather than a benefit to the land. It is a disadvantage to ditch the potatoes as deep on the lighter soils as on the heavier soils. With the exception of the first crop it is best to irrigate alfalfa after the hay is cut. Irrigation of the stubble is more easily and more evenly done than the standing crop. The hay will cure more quickly on the dry soil than on previously irrigated soil. There is no material difference in the yields in sugar beets where the soil is plowed from 4 to 20 inches deep. This {{may be due to the}} fact that the soil is of a sandier nature. The plowing under of a second and third crop of alfalfa has not produced as large tonnage of sugar beets as the second and third crops that were plowed under...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. As {{competition}} builds {{for water}} {{resources in the}} Western U. S., limited irrigation strategies for crop production are emerging to conserve agricultural water for other uses or {{as a way to}} continue to produce crops under reduced water allocations. Alfalfa is a crop with potential for water savings in a limited irrigation system. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate potential water saving strategies for alfalfa on the Front Range of Colorado. A field study evaluated four irrigation strategies: Full Irrigation (FI), Stop Irrigation After 2 nd Cutting (S 2), Spring and <b>Fall</b> <b>Irrigation</b> (SF), and Stop Irrigation After 1 st Cutting (S 1). Changes in yield, consumptive water use (ET), water-use efficiency (WUE), stand density, and forage quality were measured. Results of the study showed that yield decreased with ET in a fashion similar to previous research. Over the two year period, average yields were reduced by 3. 1, 3. 5 and 6. 5 Mg ha- 1 compared to the FI treatment for the S 2, SF, and S 1 treatments, respectively. Average ET was reduced by 28. 2, 27. 2, 48. 2 cm compared to the FI treatment for the S 2, SF, and S 1 treatments, respectively. WUE increased as irrigation decreased with an average WUE of 0. 251, 0. 327, 0. 311, and 0. 351 Mg ha- 1 cm- 1 for the FI, S 2, SF, and S 1 treatments, respectively. Also, the number of crowns m- 2 was higher in the S 2 and S 1 treatments compared to the FI and SF treatments. Finally, forage quality increased as ET decreased, which may help economically offset the reduced yield. The limited irrigation of alfalfa is an approach to conserve agricultural water to meet changing water demand while still keeping an irrigated agricultural system in production. 1...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1964 In 1957 three Douglas-fir stands (15 -, 25 -, and 40 -year-old age classes) were {{selected}} {{on a tree}} farm in the Cascade foothills of northwestern Oregon to study factors affecting site productivity. Soil-moisture, soil-temperature and seasonal radial- growth pattern measurements were made with a Colman moisture meter and a dial gauge dendrometer on thinned and unthinned subareas. Soil temperatures were significantly increased by thinning in each stand. This effect decreased with soil depth and increased with increasing intensity of thinning. Root distribution studies eight years after thinning showed that a heavily thinned stand had relatively few roots in the lower profile between the remaining trees, {{in contrast to the}} complete distribution throughout the profile in the unthinned subareas. This would indicate less overall soil-moisture depletion with thinning since the available soil-moisture levels measured within the fully rooted zone were not significantly different for the various thinning treatments. As expected radial growth increased significantly with increasing intensity of thinning. The amount and proportion of late season growth tended to increase with increasing thinning intensity although the observed differences were not statistically significant. Late season growth, however, was significantly increased by increasing crown position (intermediate to dominant) regardless of thinning treatment. Irrigation of selected trees at a ridgetop area extended the spring maximum radial growth rate throughout most of the summer. On comparable non-irrigated trees growth retardation was detectable in the range of one-half to one atmospheres of soil-moisture tension. Growth cessation occurred when soil-moisture-tension values reached the two to five atmosphere range. Irrigation of trees in a young hillside bench stand slightly increased radial growth rate during the first two years, but decreased growth in relation to non-irrigated trees during the next two years apparently as a result of excess irrigation. Fertilization with high rates of nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizers increased the late season radial growth of irrigated and non-irrigated trees in both stands. The late season response is attributed to a dwindling supply of mineralized soil nitrogen in the late summer and early <b>fall.</b> <b>Irrigation</b> and fertilization combined gave approximately additive increases in radial growth which ranged from 35 to 60 percent. It is hypothesized that potential radial growth (except for short periods at the start and end of the growing season) is equivalent to the maximum spring rate. Departures from this maximum result from deficiencies in moisture, mineral nutrient elements, or heat. Thus the maximum growth rate is proposed as an important characteristic, reflecting the potential carbohydrate productive capacity of the crown when raw material levels exceed rate limiting supplies. The fertility status of each research area was assessed by various means including soil chemical and physical analyses, sampling and chemical analyses of forest floor and litter fall material and pot fertility tests. The relative ranking of these areas in terms of fertility was consistent with their site index or productivity rating. Monterey pine and Douglas-fir seedling test plants grown on the potted soils from the different horizons in each profile responded to nitrogen, phosphorus, and sulphur additions. In field tests nitrogen fertilization stimulated radial growth of Douglas-fir whereas phosphorus fertilizer at high application rates resulted in a growth depression...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A major {{conservation}} {{practice in}} the Upper Snake-Rock (USR) watershed is the conversion from furrow irrigation to sprinkler irrigation. We compared the effect of irrigation system type on water quality and quantity at the watershed scale. Six small watersheds (150 - 700 ha) were identified with 5 to 70 % of the cropland sprinkler irrigated and the remaining fields surface or furrow irrigated. Other agricultural land uses, cropping practices and soils were similar among watersheds. Water quality and quantity entering and exiting each watershed were measured with automated samplers during the irrigation season. Irrigation inflow to watersheds and outflow from watersheds did not decrease as sprinkler irrigated area increased. This probably results from the flow rate allocation system used on the Twin <b>Falls</b> <b>irrigation</b> tract. Annual sediment loss (r=- 0. 19, P= 0. 40) and concentration (r=- 0. 38, P= 0. 30) also did not correlate with the relative amount of sprinkler irrigated area. Annual sediment loss (r- 0. 87, P= 0. 03) and concentration (r- 0. 84, P= 0. 05) correlated with irrigation inflowâ€”the more irrigation water delivered to a watershed the greater the outflow sediment concentration and loss. These preliminary results indicate that irrigation water delivery should be managed in addition to converting to sprinkler irrigation to improve water quality in this irrigated watershed...|$|R
40|$|The {{four main}} crops {{produced}} in the Texas High Plains {{have been the subject}} of water management research for several decades by the Texas Agricultural Experiment Station and the USDA/Agricultural Research Service. As expected, experimental results for yield and water use efficiency have varied for these four major crops, but many common principles have likewise emerged from this research. Definite improvements in water use efficiency have been made, and widespread application of these management principles is underway. Limited irrigation is now being widely practiced on drought tolerant crops that take advantage of expected rainfall. A 30 -day period of fairly reliable rainfall occurs from mid-May through mid-June which coincides with sorghum and cotton planting and follows typical corn planting. Sorghum has good ability to adjust to water stress. Sorghum grain requires 13 to 24 inches (330 - 610 mm) of seasonal water use (evapotranspiration) from precipitation, stored soil moisture and irrigation to achieve 3, 000 to 6, 700 pounds per acre (3, 400 - 7, 500 kg/ha) of grain sorghum yield. Dryland sorghum yields average about 1, 600 pounds per acre (1, 800 kg/ha), and yields up to 3, 000 pounds per acre (3, 400 kg/ha) are not uncommon. Peak water use rate is about 0. 30 inches per day (7. 6 mm/day). Irrigations should be timed to avoid water stress during periods of peak water use [...] boot, heading and flowering stages [...] to achieve reasonably good yields and maximum irrigation water use efficiency. Two well-timed seasonal irrigations of 4 inches (100 mm) per irrigation or the equivalent are adequate in normal years for good yields of medium maturity hybrids. Preplant irrigation is often not needed, and the same amount of water may be more efficiently used if applied at later stages of crop growth especially for conventional graded furrow irrigation systems. Conservation tillage can reduce the need for preplant irrigation of sorghum through improved soil moisture storage. Irrigation water use efficiencies may reach 400 - 500 pounds per acre-inch (1. 8 - 2. 2 kg/m 3) with limited but well-timed irrigations as compared to about 200 - 250 pounds per acre-inch (0. 88 - 1. 10 kg/m^ 3) with adequate irrigation. Saving irrigation water by withholding a 4 -inch (100 mm) irrigation reduces sorghum grain yields by only about 10 percent during the early 6 - 8 leaf stage but by almost 50 percent if withheld at the heading and bloom stage. : Corn is much more sensitive to water stress than sorghum, wheat or cotton. Corn is planted earlier than sorghum which typically allows more efficient use of the May-June wet season than for sorghum. However, early planting dates required for corn increases the need for preplant irrigation for stand establishment. Moisture stress caused by low soil water availability or hot, dry conditions during the flowering (tasseling, silking and pollination) stage can severely restrict corn yield. Preplant irrigation is often necessary, and 3 or 4 seasonal irrigations of 4 -inch (100 mm) each are essential for high corn yields in most years in the Texas High Plains. Drought seasons require one or two additional irrigations. Reduced irrigation of corn has generally resulted in significant yield decreases. Irrigation water use efficiency values are usually 250 - 450 pounds per acre-inch (1. 1 - 2. 0 kg/m^ 3) with adequate irrigation, although peak IWUE values of 500 pounds per acre-inch (2. 2 kg/m^ 3) or more have been obtained with limited irrigation in good rainfall seasons. Center pivot irrigation allows frequent irrigations of 1 to 1. 5 inches (25 - 38 mm) during peak water use periods on corn. The total seasonal water use (ET) for corn to achieve any grain yield is about 13 inches (330 mm), while seasonal ET's for peak yields are around 28 - 32 inches per year (710 - 810 mm). Peak ET rates are 0. 3 - 0. 4 inches per day (8 - 10 mm/day), depending upon weather conditions. Planned water deficits into the stress range are feasible only on soils with moderate to high water storage and during the early vegetative or grain ripening stages. Reduced acreage, rather than reduced irrigation, offers the primary way to adjust corn irrigation to limited water supplies. Winter wheat is a major drought tolerant crop with a 9 -month growing season. Wheat grows vegetatively during the drier fall to early spring period and develops grain during a period of increasing spring rainfall. Wheat is normally planted around October 1 and requires available 8011 moisture for germination and early growth, plus perhaps one late <b>fall</b> <b>irrigation</b> followed by 2 to 3 spring irrigations for good production. About one additional early irrigation (and additional applied fertilizer) is needed for early planted wheat that is grazed and also managed for grain production. Seasonal water use is around 26 to 28 inches (660 - 710 mm) for wheat (grain only) yielding 4, 700 - 5, 800 pounds per acre, or 85 - 100 bushels per acre (5, 270 - 6, 500 kg/ha). The highest yield response to irrigation usually occurs during jointing and boot stages (a relatively low rainfall period), during which irrigation water use efficiency values of about 230 pounds per acre-inch (1. 0 kg/m^ 3) are realized from a 4 inch (100 mm) irrigation. Spring irrigations totaling 4 to 12 inches (100 - 305 mm) have resulted in good irrigation water use efficiencies above 170 pounds per acre-inch (0. 75 kg/m^ 3). The least efficient irrigation is during grain filling, where IWUE values have been less than 115 pounds per acre-inch (0. 51 kg/m^ 3), and is associated with increased rainfall. Short wheat varieties in recent tests have exhibited 50 percent higher irrigation water use efficiency values than tall wheat varieties in earlier tests. Wheat yields have been increased in some experiments using no-till, limited tillage, or furrow diking as compared to conventional tillage. Cotton is a drought-tolerant long-season crop that lends itself to limited irrigation despite a somewhat complicated pattern of water use, deficits, and application. Cotton is the major irrigated crop on the Texas High Plains and is second to Wheat in dryland production acreage. Widespread production under limited irrigation has major impact on water demands and the state's water budget. Production, placement, and retention of fruiting sites are sensitive to soil water status. Early fruit set is important. Under dryland conditions, expected lint yields are in the range of 250 to 300 pounds per acre (280 - 336 kg/ha). Cotton requires over 13 inches (330 mm) of seasonal water use to produce good yields, and maximum yields occur at about 27 inches (685 mm) of seasonal water use. High water levels can decrease lint yield through excessive vegetative development and fall immaturity. A preplant irrigation of 4 -inches (100 mm) is usually advantageous especially if spring rainfall is not excessive, but heavier preplant irrigations are not warranted. Cotton has the ability to overcome moisture stress at most growth stages, but the growing season length may not accomodate late-season regrowth. The most critical period for irrigation is early to mid-bloom. If available, a second irrigation should be applied at peak to late bloom. The irrigation cut off date for cotton is mid- to late August. For irrigated cotton, yield results generally favor narrow-row with high plant populations. Irrigation water use efficiencies for cotton have ranged from as little as 20 - 30 pounds per acre-inch (0. 09 - 0. 13 kg/m^ 3) for full irrigation to as high as 80 - 100 pounds per acre-inch (0. 35 - 0. 44 kg/m^ 3) for two well-timed furrow irrigations (preplant and peak bloom) in some experiments. A reasonable target for limited furrow irrigation appears to be 50 pounds per acre-ineh (0. 22 kg/m^ 3). Cotton Irrigated with LEPA Sand drip systems produced around 90 pounds lint per acre-inch (0. 40 kg/m^ 3). Land leveling on slopes of 0. 5 percent or greater have increased yields by more than 100 pounds lint per acre (110 kg/m^ 3) for both furrow irrigated and dryland cotton...|$|E

The daily rainfall for 48 years and river flows for 45 years were analyzed to identify water excess or shortage throughout the rice-growing season. During the November-January period, 45 % of the total annual rains <b>fall.</b> The <b>irrigation</b> water supply could be reduced in the main season (November-April) because of higher rainfall occurrence. Low monthly river flows of 10. 5 m 3 /s and 10. 9 m 3 /s were observed for the Besut barrage and 2. 3 m 3 /s and 2. 4 m 3 /s for the Angga barrage in the months of July and August respectively, characterizing the driest months.

During the 2008 and 2009 irrigation seasons, DI reduced tree water status, and to some extent soil moisture, compared to CI and PRD. In all years and both cultivars, DI reduced crop load by 11 and 5 % over CI and PRD, respectively. In cvar Fuji, DI reduced production per tree by 9 % and yield efficiency by 16 % compared to CI. In all years for cvar Gala and in two of the three years for cvar Fuji, PRD and DI increased fruit soluble solid content by 5 - 6 %, whereas PRD improved peel color only in cvar Fuji and in two of the three years. In cvar Gala, DI fruit showed 27 % more sorbitol and 55 % more sucrose than PRD fruit. In both cultivars, PRD determined greater marketable yield and profit than DI. Irrigation water productivity (IWP) was increased by both PRD and DI, and in 'Fuji', PRD induced a 18 % greater IWP than DI. The different responses of the two cultivars to irrigation treatments can be attributed to differences in canopy size, crop load and mostly to the different timing of fruit growth. In particular, undergoing fast fruit growth during the irrigation period seems to induce permanent yield reductions in DI (but not PRD) trees of cvar Fuji, whereas water deficit during late fruit growth and lower crop load may have canceled the negative effect of DI in the smaller trees of cvar Gala...|$|R

This Highlight reports on the trip, which included a field visit to newly-modernized Shijin irrigation system in Hebei province. If the Shijin system is any guide, three elements of Chinaâ€™s irrigation modernization strategy are: [a] total rehabilitation of old, earthen systems into modern, lined canals for high-efficiency irrigation; [b] institutional reform of irrigation management; and [c] total recovery of irrigation fees levied at rates varying from USD 70 to 400 /ha. On all these fronts, canal irrigation in India has much ground to cover: our systems are <b>falling</b> apart; our <b>irrigation</b> institutions have declined; and most states fail to recover even token irrigation service fees (ISF). China presents a bold contrast to the Indian scene on irrigation reform...|$|R
40|$|Summary In recent decades, Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) {{forests in}} inner-Alpine dry valleys of Switzerland have {{suffered}} from drought and elevated temperatures, resulting in a higher mortality rate of trees than the mean mortality rate in Switzerland. We investigated the responses of fine roots (standing crop, morphological and physiological features) to water supply in a Scots pine forest in the Rhone valley. Before irrigation started in 2003, low- and high-productivity Scots pine trees were selected based on their crown transparency. The fine root standing crop measured in spring from 2003 to 2005 was unaffected by the irrigation treatment. However, irrigation significantly enhanced the fine root standing crop during the vegetation period when values from spring were compared with values from <b>fall</b> in 2005. <b>Irrigation</b> slightly increased specific root length but decreased root tissue density. Fine root O 2 -consumption capacity decreased slightly {{in response to the}} irrigation treatment. Using ingrowth cores to observe the responses of newly produced fine roots, irrigation had a significantly positive effect on the length of fine roots, but there were no differences between the low-and high-productivity trees. In contrast to the weak response of fine roots to irrigation, the aboveground parts responded positively to irrigation with more dense crowns. The lack of a marked response of the fine root biomass to irrigation in the low- and high-productivity trees suggests that fine roots have a high priority for within-tree carbon allocation...|$|R
