50|$|<b>Fiji</b> <b>crested</b> <b>iguanas</b> are {{predominantly}} herbivorous feeding on the leaves, fruits, shoots, and flowers from trees and shrubs. These iguanas eat both the new leaves {{and the large}} flowers from trees and shrubs. Hence, it is restricted and limited to tropical dry forests and similar habitats on islands in western Fiji. Furthermore, the <b>Fiji</b> <b>crested</b> <b>iguanas</b> particularly have a preference for sweet hibiscus flowers of the Vau tree (Hibiscus tiliaceus). The vau tree {{is one of the}} species of trees where they {{spend most of their time}} residing. <b>Fiji</b> <b>crested</b> <b>iguanas</b> do not display any major or significant seasonal shifts, sex differences, or age-class differences in their diet patterns. Moreover, scientists have observed captive hatchlings even eating insects; nonetheless, adults will not.|$|E
50|$|When <b>Fiji</b> <b>crested</b> <b>iguanas</b> first hatch {{from their}} eggs they are dark green, but {{after several hours}} their skin becomes bright emerald green and narrow white bands can be seen along their body. Their eyes are reddish orange or pinkish gold in color.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Fiji</b> <b>crested</b> <b>iguana</b> or Fijian <b>crested</b> <b>iguana</b> (Brachylophus vitiensis) is a {{critically}} endangered species of iguana native {{to some of}} the northwestern islands of the Fijiian archipelago, where it is found in dry forest.|$|R
50|$|The {{species is}} closely related to the Fiji banded <b>iguana</b> and the <b>Fiji</b> <b>crested</b> <b>iguana.</b> This species was {{described}} after a mitochondrial DNA analysis of 61 iguanas from 13 islands showed that B. bulabula was genetically and physically different from the two other species.|$|R
5000|$|The Fiji crested iguana, {{similar to}} all other iguanas, reproduces by laying eggs.The {{breeding}} season takes place between March and April, with courtship and mating commencing in January. <b>Fiji</b> <b>crested</b> <b>iguanas</b> lay large white eggs, which have a leathery texture.The Fiji crested iguana is oviparous and {{has one of the}} longest incubation periods of any reptile, which can last from 189 days to nine months. [...] Female iguanas are usually found defending the eggs and guard the nest of four to six eggs. Females dig holes on the forest floor, where three to five eggs are laid and they then fill the hole or burrow. The eggs are white and leathery, with the average number of eggs in a clutch being four ...|$|E
50|$|Due to {{the removal}} of the goats, forest area was {{increased}} by 10%-20% since 1980, which means more resources for the iguanas and a larger environment. There are many other recommended actions that should be taken {{in order for them to}} survive. The highest threat against the Fiji Crested Iguana today is predation by other animals such as the feral cat, rats, and mongoose. Physical measures should be taken to protect the iguanas from cats and mongoose, which should include removing them from the area similar to {{the removal of}} the goats. Also, the only island being monitored is Yadua Taba Island. Other islands that inhabit <b>Fiji</b> <b>Crested</b> <b>iguanas</b> such as Macuata, Monu, and Monuriki should also be monitored. Another action that should be taken is reforestation. The iguanas need more resources in order to repopulate, which means there should be more food trees that should be planted on the island for them to feed off of.|$|E
50|$|In 1998, 140 {{species were}} catalogued {{in a joint}} project between Kula Eco Park, the National Trust of Fiji, the Zoological Parks Board of New South Wales, and the Zoo Friends of Taronga Zoo. As a result, the park {{established}} a captive breeding program for the critically endangered <b>Fiji</b> <b>crested</b> <b>iguana</b> and <b>Fiji</b> banded iguana. Seven juveniles were successfully raised.|$|R
5000|$|B. vitiensis {{is found}} on the islands of Fiji, in the South Pacific. The species is {{restricted}} to tropical dry forests, specifically to the rain shadow forests located on certain islands in Fiji. [...] These forests {{are one of the}} most threatened vegetation types in the Pacific. A small population of the <b>Fiji</b> <b>Crested</b> <b>Iguana</b> - less than 80 individuals - can be {{found on the}} small island of Macuata. The majority of this species - less than 4000 individuals - is most commonly found on the island of Yadua Taba. The island is a National Trust of Fiji reserve, and is thus the only legally protected population of the <b>Fiji</b> <b>Crested</b> <b>Iguana.</b> The island is now also free of forest burning and the presence of goats, which was a major factor in the initial decline of the species. [...] There are six other Fijian islands where evidence of the species has been recorded: Deviulau, Waya, Mouriki, Monu, Qalito, and Malolo Levu.|$|R
5000|$|The eggs take roughly 8-9 months (October-November) {{to hatch}} and this {{occurs at the}} {{beginning}} of the wet season. A few of weeks prior to hatching, a brown oval mark arises on the surface of the egg. This oval mark identifies the spot where the baby iguana's head will pop out of the egg. Sometimes, a full day can pass before the <b>Fiji</b> <b>crested</b> <b>iguana</b> hatches from the egg. [...] After hatching, the baby iguanas obtain moisture by licking wet leaves.|$|R
5000|$|Yadua Tabu (pronounced [...] ) is a {{volcanic}} islet in Fiji, an outlier {{to the northern}} island of Vanua Levu, and immediately south of the larger island Yadua. Yadua Tabu covers an area of 0.7 square kilometres and has a maximum altitude of 100 meters. Yadua Tabu is a protected sanctuary for the <b>Fiji</b> <b>Crested</b> <b>Iguana,</b> Brachylophus vitiensis, and also contains a strand of dry littoral forestry, almost completely lost {{in the rest of}} Fiji. [...] Landing here is strictly prohibited.|$|R
50|$|The {{film was}} shot in Jamaica and Nanuya Levu, a privately owned island in Fiji. The flora and fauna {{featured}} in the film includes an array of animals from multiple continents. As it turned out, the iguanas filmed on Fiji were a species hitherto unknown to biologists; this was noted by the herpetologist John Gibbons when he watched the film, and after traveling to the island where the iguanas were filmed, he described the <b>Fiji</b> <b>crested</b> <b>iguana</b> (Brachylophus vitiensis) in 1981. The blue lagoon scenes were shot in Comino Island, Malta and Champagne Bay, Vanuatu.|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} closely related to the <b>Fiji</b> <b>crested</b> <b>iguana</b> and B. bulabula. The genus Brachylophus is thought to be descended from {{ancestors}} that rafted 9000 km west across the Pacific Ocean from the Americas, where their closest relatives are found. It has also been suggested that they descended from a more widespread lineage of (now extinct) Old World iguanids that diverged from their New World relatives in the Paleogene. However, no other members of the putative lineage, living or fossil, have been found outside Fiji and Tonga.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Fiji</b> <b>crested</b> <b>iguana</b> {{is a large}} stocky lizard {{distinguished}} from the Fiji banded iguana {{by the presence of}} three narrow, cream to white colored bands on males, rather than the broader bluish bands of the latter species. [...] These whitish bands often have chevrons of black scales close to them. Brachylophus vitiensis is distinguished by its larger size growing to 75 cm in length and weighing as much as 300 g. [...] It is further distinguished by the presence of a taller spiny [...] "crest" [...] on its back with spines as long as 1.5 cm running from the nape of the neck to the base of its tail.|$|R
5000|$|The {{biggest threat}} this iguana faces is habitat loss due to fires, storms, {{agricultural}} development, and competition from feral goats. [...] Goats {{were introduced to}} Yadua Taba in 1972 and numbered over 200 by the late 1970s. The vegetation on the island during this time was severely depleted {{by a combination of}} grazing and fires used to drive goats for ease of capture. [...] After the discovery of the <b>Fiji</b> <b>crested</b> <b>iguana,</b> the island was declared a sanctuary and all but a few goats were removed and fires banned. As a result, the dry forest on the island has recovered to a great extent and is the best remaining example of Pacific dry forest. Invasive Leucaena trees threaten the regeneration of native food trees for the iguanas, but the government of Fiji has taken steps to eradicate the trees.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Fiji</b> <b>crested</b> <b>iguana</b> is a diurnal {{creature}} {{that tends to}} live {{under the shade of}} trees and will seek sunlight/heat on days with cool temperature. It has the ability to rapidly change colour from green to black when aroused.It uses this ability when threatened by any potential predator in its surroundings. These colours will vary depending on the severity of the situation, bright green is standard, dark green would be slightly dangerous, and black would be an extreme. If its white bands or its sudden change in colour has not intimidated its predator, it will ultimately resort to an expansion of its neck, a bobbing of its head, and it will pounce itself towards the potential threat. In order to move from tree to tree where it usually resides, it uses the overlapping branches in order to move effectively through their environments. Their long toes and tails help them keep balance while they move through the trees.|$|R
40|$|The endemic Fijian <b>crested</b> <b>iguana</b> Brachylophus vitiensis, {{categorized}} as Critically Endangered on the IUCN Red List, {{has been recorded}} from several islands in western Fiji. We conducted a survey for the <b>crested</b> <b>iguana</b> on 12 uninhabited and five inhabited islands in the Yasawa and Mamanuca archipelagos of western Fiji in September 2000. Night searches for sleeping iguanas along a total of 11. 2 km of forest transects suggest that <b>crested</b> <b>iguanas</b> are either extremely rare or extinct {{on all of these}} islands. Although we collectively searched a total of 44 km of transect over 123 person hours, we located <b>crested</b> <b>iguanas</b> on only four islands: three small uninhabited islands (all, 73 ha) and one large inhabited island (22 km). In July 2003 we resurveyed two islands identified as having the best potential for the long-term conservation of <b>crested</b> <b>iguanas,</b> and found that populations were continuing to decline. We suggest that the scarcity of <b>crested</b> <b>iguanas</b> on all islands surveyed is due to the combination of habitat loss and the introduction of exotic predators. All islands surveyed have free ranging goats, forest fires have occurred repeatedly over the last few decades, and feral cats are established on many islands. To reverse the population decline of this species immediate intervention is required on selected islands to halt continuing forest degradation and to clarify the effects of introduced predators...|$|R

40|$|The Critically Endangered Fijian <b>crested</b> <b>iguana,</b> Brachylophus vitiensis, {{occurs at}} extreme density at only one location, with {{estimates}} of > 10, 000 iguanas {{living on the}} 70 hectare island of Yadua Taba in Fiji. We conducted a mark and recapture study over two wet seasons, investigating the spatial ecology and intraspecific interactions of the strictly arboreal Fijian <b>crested</b> <b>iguana.</b> This species exhibits moderate male-biased sexual size dimorphism, which has been linked in other lizard species to territoriality, aggression and larger male home ranges. We found that male Fijian <b>crested</b> <b>iguanas</b> exhibit high injury levels, indicative of frequent aggressive interactions. We did not find support for larger home range size in adult males relative to adult females, however male and female residents were larger than roaming individuals. Males with established home ranges also had larger femoral pores relative to body size than roaming males. Home range areas were small in comparison {{to those of other}} iguana species, and we speculate that the extreme population density impacts considerably on the spatial ecology of this population. There was extensive home range overlap within and between sexes. Intersexual overlap was greater than intrasexual overlap for both sexes, and continuing male-female pairings were observed among residents. Our results suggest that the extreme population density necessitates extensive home range overlap even though the underlying predictors of territoriality, such as male biased sexual size dimorphism and high aggression levels, remain. Our findings should be factored in to conservation management efforts for this species, particularly in captive breeding and translocation programs...|$|R

40|$|The Fijian <b>crested</b> <b>iguana</b> (Brachylophus vitiensis) is {{restricted}} to tropical dry forest habitat and has been extirpated from over 80 % of its original range primarily because of habitat destruction. A large population on Yadua Taba island has been proposed {{as a source for}} iguana translocations. This study aimed to determine the dietary and habitat requirements of the herbivorous B. vitiensis on Yadua Taba to identify essential tree species. Between September 2005 and June 2006 we examined the diet of B. vitiensis using faecal analyses, while perch preferences were examined using field surveys. Faecal analyses identified 26 plant species in the diet of B. vitiensis, while field surveys recorded iguanas in 33 tree species. The most common diet species largely overlapped with the most common perch species. There were no major seasonal shifts, sex differences, or age-class variations in diet or perch preferences. These results suggest that while B. vitiensis occurs in and consumes several plant species on Yadua Taba, it is primarily dependent on only a few species. To improve translocation success, future translocations of B. vitiensis need to ensure that these important tree species are present at new sites. No Full Tex...|$|R
40|$|The lizard fauna of Polynesia {{consists}} {{mainly of}} skinks and geckos that {{are believed to}} have reached many of the islands by way of human assistance beginning with the early Polynesian voyagers. Documenting the natural versus human-assisted origins of lizards in the Pacific would be greatly enhanced by a fossil record, but that record for lizards has been limited to a few archaeological and noncultural sites that postdate human arrival. This study reports fossil remains of eight, possibly nine, species of lizards screened from cave sediments on 'Eua, Tonga. One of these deposits is precultural, the deepest layers of which were excavated from below a calcite lens dated at ca. 60, 000 to 80, 000 yr B. P. Fossils from the precultural strata include a gecko referred to Perochirus sp., a genus known today no nearer than Vanuatu; a skink representing either an undescribed species of Emoia or Emoia trossula Brown & Gibbons; and remains of the widespread Emoia cyanura (Lesson). A single bone of an unidentified large (> 150 mm snout-vent length) skink (cf. Emoia, Eugongylus) was recovered from deposits of post-human arrival age, but no such large skinks are currently known from the island. Additional cave sites yielded essentially contemporaneous remains of species extant on 'Eua: Gehyra oceanica (Lesson), Lepidodactylus cf. lugubris (Dumeril & Bibron), Nactus pelagicus (Girard), Cryptoblepharus poecilopleurus (Wiegmann), and Lipinia noctua (Lesson).

50|$|The second {{instalment}} {{looks at}} how plants, {{animals and humans}} colonised even the most remote islands. Most pioneers came from the west, with New Guinea acting as the launch pad. The saltwater crocodile is one species which managed to swim the 60-mile crossing to the next island group, the Solomons. The mass spawning of groupers on a Solomon Island reef releases millions of eggs, which drift on ocean currents to establish new populations. The activity allows grey reef sharks to snatch a few distracted groupers. Few animals made it to Fiji, Tonga and Samoa, 1000 miles further east. Fruit bats were the only mammals to cross the ocean divide, but smaller animals were carried here by cyclones and jet stream winds. In the absence of ground predators, invertebrates have reached monstrous proportions. Fijian <b>crested</b> <b>iguanas</b> {{are thought to have}} floated here on rafts of vegetation. Seabirds have made the crossing to French Polynesia, where their rich guano helped fertilise barbed seeds stuck to their feathers and turn barren coral atolls into fertile groves. One plant needs no such help. Coconuts can survive drifting for two months at sea and lay roots into bare sand. Before the arrival of humans, fewer than 500 species colonised Hawaii in 30 million years. Once established, they evolved into countless new varieties. The story of human colonisation is no less remarkable. The ancestors of modern Polynesians, most probably Lapitas of Southeast Asia, arrived in Fiji 3,500 years ago and Hawaii 2,000 years ago.|$|R
40|$|Tropical dry {{forests are}} {{a unique and}} {{threatened}} ecosystem in the Pacific and globally. In Fiji, the endangered Fijian <b>crested</b> <b>iguana</b> (Bracbylopbus vitiensis) is endemic to tropical dry forests. Yadua Taba Island contains {{one of the best}} remaining stands of tropical dry forest in the Pacific along with the largest (and only secure) population of B. vitiensis in Fiji and has been proposed as a translocation source for iguana conservation. In this study we determined the major vegetation types on Yadua Taba and identified forest habitat preferences of B. vitiensis to (1) characterize the island's habitats for tropical dry forest regeneration monitoring and (2) understand which forest types are preferred by iguanas for future translocation projects. Vegetation data were collected using reconnaissance, entitation, line transects, and aerial photos. Iguana abundance data were collected by nocturnal surveys of permanent transects. Six major vegetation types were identified of which tropical dry forest was the largest (46 % of the island), followed by a combination of rocky cliff-shrubland/grassland vegetation (26 %). Our conservative estimate of B. vitiensis population size on Yadua Taba is 12, 000 iguanas, the majority of which occur in tropical dry forest. Superabundance of the dry forest understory tree Vavaea amicorum, the favorite fruit species of iguanas, may help account for the high density of iguanas observed. These results highlight the ecological link between tropical dry forest and B. vitiensis and emphasize the importance of rehabilitation or conservation of tropical dry forest habitat in potential iguana translocation sites as part of the management plan for B. vitiensis throughout the Fiji Islands.
