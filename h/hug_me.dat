2500|$|The {{original}} song had a changed hook where Minaj sang [...] "I feel pretty/I feel pretty/I feel pretty, and witty, and gay/And I pity/any girl who isn't me tonight!", which are lyrics in [...] "I Feel Pretty" [...] from the musical, West Side Story. Eminem's first verse {{also had a}} changed ending where he yelled [...] "I feel ugly/I feel ugly/Slut don't touch me or <b>hug</b> <b>me,</b> I'm mad/And I pity/any girl who gets with me tonight!" [...] When listened to, {{it is still possible}} to hear Nicki say [...] "I feel..." [...] {{at the beginning of the}} first chorus.|$|E
2500|$|A {{number of}} television, radio, and {{newspaper}} reports listed Ladany {{as one of}} those killed. One headline stated: [...] "Ladany Could Not Escape his Fate in Germany for a Second Time". Ladany recalled later:The impact did not hit me at the time, when we were in Munich. It was when we arrived back in Israel. At the airport in Lod there was a huge crowd – maybe 20,000, people – and each one of us, the survivors, stood by one of the coffins on the runway. Some friends {{came up to me and}} tried to kiss me and <b>hug</b> <b>me</b> as if I was almost a ghost that came back alive. It was then that I really grasped what had happened and the emotion hit me.|$|E

6000|$|... "Mr. Derek, d'you {{know what}} they say--they say you're in love. You was seen in th' orchard. Ah! 'tis all right for you and her! But if any one kiss and <b>hug</b> <b>ME,</b> I got to go!" ...|$|E
60|$|All supreme {{emotion is}} dumb. Kysh {{put on the}} brake and <b>hugged</b> <b>me</b> to his bosom till I groaned. Then, as I remember, he crooned like a mother {{returned}} to her suckling.|$|R
6000|$|And {{everybody}} runs to see, and she snatches off my hat, and out {{comes the}} bread and {{what was left of}} the butter, and she grabbed <b>me,</b> and <b>hugged</b> <b>me,</b> and says: ...|$|R
6000|$|It was Jim's voice--nothing ever {{sounded so}} good before. I {{run along the}} bank a piece and got aboard, and Jim he grabbed <b>me</b> and <b>hugged</b> <b>me,</b> he was {{so glad to see}} me. He says: ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'That is {{what she}} says over me, as I go to sleep in her bosom at night,' said the child, in a {{wondering}} voice, soon exchanged for entreaty, 'Oh, <b>hug</b> <b>me</b> not so hard! Oh, let me go--let me go to her! Mother! mother!' ...|$|E

[Another roar of laughter.] ...|$|E
60|$|In that {{whirling}} {{moment when}} the crowd went mad and Milly was <b>hugging</b> <b>me,</b> and Nan pounding holes in my hat, I had a queer sort of blankness, a section of time when my sensations were deadlocked.|$|R

60|$|We are {{all well}} and happy, and they send loves to you by the bushel. We are in the agonies of house-hunting. The people are frightfully civil, and grotesquely extortionate. One man (with a house to let) told me {{yesterday}} that he loved the Duke of Wellington like a brother. The same gentleman wanted to <b>hug</b> <b>me</b> round the neck with one hand, and pick my pocket with the other.|$|E
60|$|In a word, {{they were}} married, {{and had gone}} into the church for no other purpose. Peggotty was {{resolved}} that it should be quietly done; and the clerk had given her away, and there had been no witnesses of the ceremony. She was a little confused when Mr. Barkis made this abrupt announcement of their union, and could not <b>hug</b> <b>me</b> enough in token of her unimpaired affection; but she soon became herself again, and said she was very glad it was over.|$|E
6000|$|... "The whale, the whale! Up helm, up helm! Oh, all ye sweet {{powers of}} air, now <b>hug</b> <b>me</b> close! Let not Starbuck die, if die he must, in a woman's fainting fit.

Up helm again! He turns to meet us! Oh, his unappeasable brow drives on towards one, whose duty tells him he cannot depart. My God, stand by me now!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was afraid}} you had {{forgotten}} how to do it," [...] she laughed, when at last he released her. [...] "Do you know, you haven't <b>hugged</b> <b>me,</b> Dad, since I was five years old. That's nineteen years ago. You do love me, don't you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{positively}} <b>hugged</b> <b>me.</b> 'My dear,' she cried, 'you are the cleverest {{little woman}} I {{ever met in}} my life!

60|$|He {{threw his}} arms around my neck, bent me over his stomach to his breast, kissed me on both cheeks, <b>hugged</b> <b>me</b> four or five times, and then placed me in his own arm-chair. As soon as I had got well again, we began {{business}} at once.|$|R
6000|$|Jim lit out, and was a-coming for me {{with both}} arms spread, he {{was so full of}} joy; but when I glimpsed him in the {{lightning}} my heart shot up in my mouth and I went overboard backwards; for I forgot he was old King Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one, and it most scared the livers and lights out of me. But Jim fished me out, and was going to <b>hug</b> <b>me</b> and bless me, and so on, he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the king and the duke, but I says: ...|$|E
6000|$|Through the darkness, {{through that}} Northern pine-walled silence, he blundered {{down to the}} lake-front and found a canoe. There were no paddles in it but with a board, sitting awkwardly {{amidships}} and poking at the water rather than paddling, {{he made his way}} far out on the lake. The lights of the hotel and the cottages became yellow dots, a cluster of glow-worms at the base of Sachem Mountain. Larger and ever more imperturbable was the mountain in the star-filtered darkness, and the lake a limitless pavement of black marble. He was dwarfed and dumb and a little awed, but that insignificance freed him from the pomposities of being Mr. George F. Babbitt of Zenith; saddened and freed his heart. Now he was conscious of the presence of Paul, fancied him (rescued from prison, from Zilla and the brisk exactitudes of the tar-roofing business) playing his violin {{at the end of the}} canoe. He vowed, [...] "I will go on! I'll never go back! Now that Paul's out of it, I don't want to see any of those damn people again! I was a fool to get sore because Joe Paradise didn't jump up and <b>hug</b> <b>me.</b> He's one of these woodsmen; too wise to go yelping and talking your arm off like a cityman. But get him back in the mountains, out on the trail--! That's real living!" ...|$|E

6000|$|She hit {{his head}} a thump with her thimble as we dodged by, and he let on to be whimpering as we struck for the stairs. Up in his room he <b>hugged</b> <b>me,</b> he was so {{out of his head}} for gladness because he was going traveling. And he says: ...|$|R
