50|$|A {{charterparty}} {{governs the}} relationship between the shipowner and the charterer. The bill of lading governs {{the relationship between}} the shipper and the carrier (who will be either a shipowner or a <b>demise</b> <b>charterer).</b> If the exporter (the shipper) is shipping a small amount of cargo, he will arrange for a carrier to carry the goods for him, using a bill of lading. If the exporter needs the whole (or a very substantial part) of the ship's cargo capacity, the exporter may need to charter the vessel, and he will enter into a charterparty agreement with the shipowner.|$|E
50|$|A P&I Club is {{a mutual}} {{insurance}} association that provides risk pooling, information and representation for its members. Unlike a marine insurance company, which reports to its shareholders, a P&I club reports only to its members. Originally, P&I Club members were typically shipowners, ship operators or <b>demise</b> <b>charterers,</b> but more recently freight forwarders and warehouse operators {{have been able to}} join.|$|R
5000|$|Conventional P&I cover {{has been}} taken up {{primarily}} by shipowners and <b>demise</b> <b>charterers,</b> but a new development is P&I cover for time- and voyage-charterers. Since these charterers may have no long-term relationship with any vessel, and may well have periods {{when they are not}} chartering at all, the mutual model based on common-pool sharing of liability is not necessarily ideal. Some non-mutual [...] "charterers P&I clubs" [...] have arisen [...] whereby a private company may act as broker to provide 3rd-party cover via underwriters, on payment of as conventional premium, rather than a P&I call. In addition to brokerage services, such a company may offer conventional [...] "our man on the spot" [...] P&I services.|$|R
5000|$|If {{the charter}} {{party is a}} time or voyage charterparty, the {{shipowner}} will still have control {{of the ship and}} its crew. If there is a demise (or [...] "bareboat") charterparty, the charterer will effectively have a long lease and will have full control of the vessel. If the master (the captain) issues a B/L to a shipper, he will be acting as an agent for the carrier, who will be either the shipowner (time or voyage) or the <b>charterer</b> (<b>demise).</b>|$|R

40|$|Summary: Reconciling the {{conflicting}} {{interests of the}} maritime claimants and shipowners {{has always been a}} controversial issue in the domain of Admiralty Law. [...] . (a) The person who owned the ship at the time when the maritime claim arose is liable for the claim and is owner of the ship when the arrest is effected; or(b) the <b>demise</b> <b>charterer</b> of the ship at the time when the maritime claim arose is liable for the claim and is <b>demise</b> <b>charterer</b> or owner of the ship when the arrest is effected. [...] . Where the maritime claim is in respect of ownership or possession of a ship, sister ship arrest is not permissible under either of the conventions. [...] . In modern shipping practice, many fleets operate within large shipowning groups, owned and controlled by the same parent corporation or holding company, but with each vessel in the fleet or group legally owned by (in other words, registered in the name of) a separate one-ship company. [...] . A significant change in the latter Convention with regard to release from arrest is to limit the amount of security to the value of the arrested ship. [...] . 7 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is to discuss in detail privileged marithne claims, Maritime Liensfocusing on their {{existence}} in Enghsh Law, {{and deal with the}} aspects of their enforcement, whilst also considering the problems which can -and in practice usually do- arise while the entitied claimants attempt to enforce their Maritime Liens. The points covered by this thesis include the principle of Maritime Liens as recognised under English Law, and the way that these can be enforced against the offending maritime property in order to satisfy the existing claims. Also, discussed are the-various problems with which maritime lienholders aire often faced, such as the conflict'of laws existing between the numerous maritime nations-as well as the various Conventions that have been createdin order to eliminate the existing problems relating to Maritime lines arid the Arrest of Ships!. Additionally, a brief discussion about the need for the creation of uniform rules regarding Maritime Liens wiU be made, followed by an outline of the practice of forum shopping. To give a more specific preview of this thesis, the stmcture of the chapters presented is this: In the first -introductory- chapter Maritime Liens are defined and historically reviewed; the concept of Maritime Liens is closely examined by discussing their fundamental characteristics and properties, and, finally, their worth as a privileged maritime claim is evaluated. At the same time, a brief introduction to the problems that claimants may face while trying to enforce them, as weU as the attempts that have been made to unify the Intemational law regarding Maritime Liens, is given. The second chapter deals with Maritime Liens recognised in English Law, discussing those claims which give the claimant the right to proceed in rem against maritime property. In the third chapter, the enforcement of Maritime Liens is discussed. The whole procedure of enforcing a claim is dealt with in detail, startmg from the action in rem, and its nature, to the arrest of ships. The right to arrest a sister ship is also considered as well as the issue of arresting a ship chartered by <b>demise</b> <b>charterers.</b> The actual procedure of arrest is also mentioned, including the practicalities of arrest; further, the difficulties that claimants encounter in enforcing Maritime Liens are discussed -such as the extinction of Maritime Liens, the provisions of the 1976 Convention on Limitation of Liability for Maritime Claims and the Caveat Against Arrest. The fourth chapter introduces the issue of the conflict of laws relating to Maritime Liens; it concentrates into the numerous forms the problem can take, extensively discussing the matter of priority of Maritime Liens. The priority given under the English, American and the 1926 Maritime Liens and Mortgages Convention are briefly mentioned. Finally, the attempts that have so far been, made to settie and unify the existing Maritime Liens conflicts are reviewed, considering the various Conventions relating to both Maritime Liens and Mortgages and the Arrest of ships. In the fifth Chapter, aspects such as the uniformity that could be achieved through the ratification of international conventions and the practice of forum shopping are dealt with. Finally, in the sbcth Chapter, a brief summary of the project and its scope is made and conclusions are drawn...|$|R
40|$|The Ocean Victory In 2013 in The Ocean Victory, 1 Teare J {{held that}} time charterers were in {{breach of the}} safe port clause, and that the breach had caused the total loss of the vessel. They had ordered Ocean Victory to Kashima in Japan, and the {{casualty}} had occurred {{as a result of}} a combination of “long waves” and very high northerly winds, not perhaps so rare in isolation, but certainly very rare in combination. The peril of long waves had persuaded the master to leave the port, in the course of which very strong headwinds, in the fairway, had led to Ocean Victory foundering against a breakwater. There was also a damages issue. The time charter was a sub-charterparty, and the principal action was by the (<b>demise)</b> head <b>charterers</b> against the defendant sub-charterers. 2 The sub-charterers argued that the head charterers had suffered no loss, because a clause in the head charter requiring charterers to insure the hull was to be taken as a complete code, 3 to the exclusion of other liability for damage to the ship. The argument was that, because the order to Kashima therefore occasioned the claimants no liability under the safe port clause in the head charter, there were no damages to be awarded, even if there was a breach of the sub-charter. Teare J rejected the sub-charterers’ argument. Commenting on this case in 2014, 4 I observed that “Teare J [had] systematically demolished the charterers’ arguments at every stage. The judgment has the impression of being very pro-owner”. His decision has now been reversed in the Court of Appeal, both on the issue of breach, and on the complete code argument. 5 Because there was no breach, the appellate court did not need to decide, and did not decide, whether Teare J had been correct on the causation issue. 6 1.
