50|$|A circle hook {{is a type}} of {{fish hook}} which is sharply curved back in a {{circular}} shape. It has become widely used among anglers in recent years because the hook generally catches more fish and is rarely swallowed. Since the circle hook catches the fish on the lips at the corner of its mouth, it usually decreases the mortality rates of released fish as compared to <b>J-hook</b> (like O'Shaughnessy or Octopus hooks) which are often swallowed by the fish, causing damage to the gills or vital organs.The circle hook's shape allows it to only hook onto an exposed surface, which {{in the case of a}} fish means the corner of its mouth. The fish takes the baited hook and swallows it, and as the hook is reeled in, it is safely pulled out of the fish until it reaches the mouth. At this point it will catch the corner of the mouth, resulting in fewer gut-hooked fish.|$|E

40|$|In-channel {{structures}} are often installed in alluvial rivers during restoration to steer currents, {{but they also}} modify the streambed morphology and water surface proﬁle, and alter hydraulic gradients driving ecologically important hyporheic exchange. Although river features before and after restoration need to be compared, few studies have collected detailed observations to facilitate this comparison. We created a laboratory mobile-bed alluvial meandering river and collected detailed measurements in the highly sinuous meander before and after installation of in-channel structures, which included one cross vane and six <b>J-hooks</b> situated along 1 bar unit. Measurements of streambed and water surface elevation with sub-millimeter vertical accuracy and horizontal resolution were obtained using close-range photogrammetry. Compared to the smooth gradually varied water surface proﬁle for control runs without structures, the structures created rapidly varied ﬂow with subcritical to supercritical ﬂow transitions, as well as backwater and forced-morphology pools, which increased volumetric storage by 74 % in the entire stream reach. The <b>J-hooks,</b> located along the outer bank of the meander bend and downstream of the cross vane, created stepwise patterns in the streambed and water surface longitudinal proﬁles. The pooling of water behind the cross vane increased the hydraulic gradient across the meander neck by 1 % and increased local groundwater gradients by 4 %, with smaller increases across other transects through the intrameander zone. Scour pools developed downstream of the cross vane and around the <b>J-hooks</b> situated near the meander apex. In-channel structures signiﬁcantly changed meander bend hydraulic gradients, and the detailed streambed and water surface 3 -D maps provide valuable data for computational modeling of changes to hyporheic exchange...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of circle hook and <b>J-hook</b> in pelagic longline fishery were determined in 13 fishing stations in three designated areas. The research/training vessel, namely M. V. SEAFDEC, was employed for the fishing operations during 5 November to 4 December 2007. The survey area was mutually defined as area A: latitude 16 °N- 19 °N and longitude 88 °E- 91 °E (5 stations), area B: latitude 9 °N- 14 °N and longitude 82 °E- 85 °E (4 stations), area C: latitude 10 °N- 12 °N and longitude 95 °E- 97 °E (4 stations). The main {{objective of this}} work is to evaluate the {{efficiency of}} 18 / 0 10 ° offset circle hook {{in comparison with the}} <b>J-hook</b> using three different types of baits i. e., round scad (Decapterus sp.), milk fish (Chanos chanos) and Indian mackerel (Rastrelliger kanagurta). A total of 6, 277 hooks was deployed during the survey program. The results appeared that, using circle hook, the percentage compositions of target fish (tuna and billfish) and by-catch fish were not much different, 46. 67 % and 53. 33 % respectively. In contrast, <b>J-hook</b> showed a higher difference between these 2 components, target fish 25. 53 % and by-catch fish 74. 47 %. Considering catch rates, in overall CPUE (individual/ 1, 000 hooks) of circle hook was lower than that of <b>J-hook</b> (4. 77 versus 7. 48). When separated by fish group, for target fish the CPUE of circle hook was a little higher than <b>J-hook</b> (2. 23 versus 1. 91), but for by-catch fish the CPUE of <b>J-hook</b> was obviously higher (5. 58 versus 2. 55).

40|$|An {{emerging}} body {{of literature}} has demonstrated {{the benefits of the}} use of circle hooks relative to standard <b>J-hooks</b> in commercial and recreational fisheries. In the pelagic longline fishery for tunas (Thunnus spp.) and swordfish (Xiphias gladius Linnaeus, 1758), the use of circle hooks has resulted in greater catch rates of some target species, lower catch rates of some bycatch species, and a higher percentage of many target and bycatch species alive at the time of haulback (gear retrieval). However, a lack of agreement among results of studies conducted in different fisheries and areas, using different baits and rigging techniques, and with different styles and sizes of circle hooks has hindered the adoption of this terminal tackle as a management measure at the international level. Nevertheless, some countries have mandated the use of circle hooks in pelagic longline fisheries to protect bycatch species, and some individual fishers have incorporated circle hooks because they appear to maximize individual profit. In the recreational fishery for billfishes (family Istiophoridae), which is primarily a catch-and-release fishery in the United States, studies have demonstrated that circle hooks result in higher rates of external hooking and post-release survival than standard <b>J-hooks.</b> The use of circle hooks in billfish fisheries has been promoted by the sportfishing industry and is currently required by some nations; however, partnerships promoting active outreach and education with stakeholders in both commercial and recreational fisheries are critical to maximize the use and conservation benefit of this technology...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} the circle-hook on hooking injury, fish size and catch rates were {{evaluated}} for mixed-species recreational boat fisheries in the Balearic Islands (NW Mediterranean). The relationships between deep-hooking incidence (the main cause of fish mortality) and hook type (circle hooks vs conventional <b>J-hooks),</b> fish size, and angler were tested. Results demonstrated {{that the size of}} the fish was the most important predictor of deep-hooking incidence, as a larger fish size resulted in an increase in deeper wounds. Hook type also had a significant effect on the deep-hooking rate. Specifically, the deep-hooking rate of the most frequently-caught species, Diplodus annularis (L.) and Coris julis (L.), was reduced by greater than half with the circle hooks. The mean size of the fish caught and the unhooking time were not affected by the use of circle hooks. Finally, their use resulted in no change in the catch per unit effort (CPUE) compared to conventional hooks for both univariate and multivariate procedures. Hence, circle hooks are a promising conservation tool for marine resources when linked with catch-and-release strategies. © 2009 Blackwell Verlag, Berlin. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

The endangered status of several sea turtle species, {{and the success of}} circle hooks (‘treatment’ hooks) in reducing turtle hookings in other ocean areas, as compared to <b>J-hooks</b> and Japanese-style tuna hooks (‘control’ hooks), prompted the initiation of a hook exchange program on the west coast of Latin America, the Eastern Pacific Regional Sea Turtle Program (EPRSTP) 1. One of the goals of the EPRSTP is to determine if circle hooks would be effective at reducing turtle bycatch in artisanal fisheries of the EPO without significantly reducing the catch of marketable fish species. Participating fishers were provided with circle hooks at no cost and asked to replace the J/Japanese-style tuna hooks on their longlines with circle hooks in an alternating manner. Data collected by the EPRSTP show differences in longline gear and operational characteristics within and among countries. These aspects of the data, in addition to difficulties encountered with implementation of the alternating-hook design, pose challenges for analysis of these data. ...|$|R

40|$|This study evaluated, over a 4 -month study period, {{the amount}} of apical root {{resorption}} occurring in maxillary central incisors following their retraction when employing either micro-implant or <b>J-hook</b> headgear anchorage. The prospective randomised clinical trial was conducted in Orthodontic Clinic, College of Stomatology, China from 2008 – 2009. Subjects are patients requiring fixed appliances on waiting list (n= 20). In female Han Chinese patients aged from 16 – 26 years, standardized periapical radiographs from 10 randomly assigned patients with maxillary protrusions comprising the micro-implant group, and from 10 similar patients comprising the <b>J-hook</b> headgear group, were assessed for maxillary central incisor apical root resorption. Measurements before and after orthodontic therapy were also obtained from lateral cephalometric radiographs to calculate incisor horizontal retraction and vertical intrusion distances. Estimated retraction force vectors were calculated in horizontal and vertical directions for both treatment groups. Data analysis employed t-tests and the Pearson correlation test, with α= 0. 05 for statistical significance. The results showed that {{when compared with the}} <b>J-hook</b> group, significantly more apical root resorption shortening of the maxillary central incisors was observed in the micro-implant group (1. 27 mm difference, 95 % CI= 0. 70 – 1. 84, P< 0. 001), which was associated with a significantly larger retraction distance (P= 0. 004) and a smaller vertical force component (P< 0. 0001). We are led to conclude that continuous activation of the nickel-titanium coil springs used in the micro-implant group resulted in significantly more apical root resorption shortening and maxillary central incisor retraction than when intermittent <b>J-hook</b> retraction was employed. The employment of continuous duration orthodontic forces presents a risk for increased apical root resorption that requires careful radiographic monitoring. Qingzhu Wang, Wenjing Chen, Roger J.

5000|$|Billfish are {{exploited}} both as {{food and}} as fish. Marlin and sailfish are eaten {{in many parts}} of the world, and many sport fisheries target these species. Swordfish are subject to particularly intense fisheries pressures, and although their survival is not threatened worldwide, they are now comparatively rare in many places where once they were abundant. The istiophorid billfishes (marlin and spearfish) also suffer from intense fishing pressures. High mortality levels occur when they are caught incidentally by longline fisheries targeting other fish. Overfishing continues to [...] "push these declines further in some species". Because of these concerns about declining populations, sport fishermen and conservationists now work together to gather information on billfish stocks and implement programs such as catch and release, where fish are returned to the sea after they have been caught. However, the process of catching them can leave them too traumatised to recover. Studies have shown that circle fishing hooks do much less damage to billfish than the traditional <b>J-hooks,</b> yet they are at just as effective for catching billfish. This is good for conservation, since it improves survival rates after release.|$|R

Between 108 and 114 fish of each species were angled and allowed to ingest conventional or modified (with notches to reduce wire diameter by ∼ 20 %) <b>J-hooks</b> (∼ 250 mm 2) made from three materials (stainless steel and nickel-plated and red-lacquer carbon steel), before being released into tanks and monitored with control fish for up to 61 d.

Of the survivors, 30, 61, and 77 %, respectively, ejected their hooks (and only one hook-ejected fish died). For yellowfin bream, hook ejection (and hence survival) was positively correlated with total length, and hook oxidation was the key predictor of ejection from mulloway and snapper, which could be promoted by selecting carbon-steel designs with narrow wire diameters and minimal protective coating. The choice of coating might also be important, with relatively greater mortality among mulloway and yellowfin bream that ingested nickel-plated hooks...|$|R
40|$|Commercial {{fisheries}} {{are recognized}} as one of the greatest threats to shark populations worldwide, but factors affecting the likelihood of shark mortality during fishery capture are poorly understood. We used the U.

Mortality rates and trends in both species closely matched those recorded from other sources, and therefore indicated that the data on sharks discarded dead and discarded alive in the U. S. pelagic fishery logbook are accurate. The introduction of fisheries management regulations (fin weight to carcass weight ratios in 1993 [to prevent finning] and the prohibition of <b>J-hooks</b> in 2004) presumably decreased the immediate mortality rate of captured blue and tiger sharks (by 8. 0 % in blue sharks after 2004 and 4. 4 % in tiger sharks after 1993). Other factors that we examined had a statistically significant effect on mortality, but additional variables should be recorded or made available in logbook data to enable the determination of other causes of mortality.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The central {{question}} {{of this case}} study asks if circle hook use in Ecuador is motivated {{by a desire to}} catch more sharks. Circle hooks are a conservation technology that limits the by-catch of sea turtles. In 2004, the World Wildlife Fund, the Inter American Tropical Tuna Commission, (IATTC) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spearheaded a hook exchange project in the Ecuadorian pelagic longline fishery. Widely used <b>j-hooks</b> were voluntarily exchanged for circle hooks. Volunteers also accepted observers on board. During observation circle hooks were found to increase the capture of sharks. Trade in shark fins is highly lucrative. The promotion of a hook that can capture more sharks may lead to an unintended consequence - increases in the targeting and capturing of sharks. Ecuadorian law allows only the incidental capture of sharks. Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with hook promoters, IATTC biologist, and Ecuadorian fishery leaders, indicate that hooks may be related to an increase in the landings of shark, especially to supply the market for fins. Survey work was conducted in 6 sites along the Ecuadorian coastline. A majority of boat owners, captains, and deckhands (71 %) self-nominated sharks as a target catch. Those familiar with circle hooks indicated that the use of the hooks was not relegated to only the conservation of turtles - captains (41 %) and owners (37 %) preferred circle hooks for their ability to capture shark. There {{was no significant difference in}} self nominated shark capture between users of circle hooks (78 %) and j hooks (74 %).

40|$|Mulkey, Inc. is {{participating}} in a stream restoration study with the Ecosystem Enhancement Program in Yadkin County, North Carolina. The {{purpose of this study}} is to restore approximately 4, 300 linear feet of Rocky Branch, a second order stream locatedin the western Piedmont of North Carolina. Stream restoration in North Carolina is generally conducted to provide compensatory mitigation for stream impacts from both highway construction and private development. Since the late 1990 s, North Carolina has served at the forefront for stream restoration activities due to the state’s tremendous population growth and stringent water quality standards. In an effort to provide mitigation for the state’s needs in an efficient manner, the Ecosystem Enhancement Program was created in 2003 under an agreement with the North Carolina Department of Environment and Natural Resources, the North Carolina Department of Transportation, and the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers. There are approximately 400 streams and wetland restoration projects that are currently under development across 54 watersheds in North Carolina. Those resources having the greatest repair needs are prioritized and the Ecosystem Enhancement Program works with public and private organizations in an effort to restore, to enhance and to preserve wetlands, streams, and buffers, statewide. The Ecosystem Enhancement Program serves as the nucleus for consolidating and streamlining mitigation activities within the state. The project presented here is one of the many projects this program administers in an effort to meet the ever growing mitigation needs in the state. The Rocky Branch site comprises approximately 24 acres of pasture and woodlands immediately adjacent to the Interstate 77 corridor in Yadkin County, North Carolina. The project site has a drainage area of approximately 3. 1 square miles and is part of the South Yadkin River Watershed. The site was once heavily forested, but over the last 100 years has been cleared primarily for pasture and row crops. Cattle have been a significant part of the land-use since the early part of the 20 th century and their impact is highly visible through compaction, erosion, and denuded vegetation along the stream. The objectives of the Rocky Branch stream restoration project were and continue to be: 1) to provide mitigation for future needs in the area, 2) to improve water quality by excluding cattle from the stream, 3) to provide a stable and functional stream channel, 4) to improve the overall quality of the stream and riparian areas and 5) to provide long-term protection of the project through a conservation easement. The restoration of Rocky Branch’s main channel and its associated tributary were completed using methods based on the work of David L. Rosgen, PhD, which emphasize the use of natural stability concepts. The stream restoration project created a new stream channel with the appropriate dimension, pattern, and profile for its specific location within the watershed. The new channel contains in-stream boulder structures which provide grade control, bank stabilization, and aquatic habitat. Boulder structures used in conjunction with this project include cross vanes, rock vanes, and <b>j-hooks.</b> The stream banks were stabilized using erosion control matting, native seed mixes, bare root seedlings, rootwads, and live vegetation stakes. A permanent riparian buffer was established using native vegetation specific to the region. Vernal pools were established throughout the riparian buffer to provide habitat, water storage capacity and micro-topography. To protect the project from disturbance, permanent fencing was established around the entire site. As is true for projects of this type, an as-built report documenting stream restoration and enhancement is developed to provide a baseline for future monitoring or success criteria. A monitoring program will be implemented to document system development and progress toward achieving the success criteria as stipulated in the mitigation requirements for the project permit. Monitoring will take place over a 5 -year period or until final success criteria are achieved...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{technological}} improvements {{of the last}} two decades, it is possible for innovations to follow each other rapidly. However, not all innovations are useful ones, and a lot of producers often {{do not know how to}} market their new products. Diffusion theory, started by Gabriel Tarde (1903), first proposed the S-shaped diffusion curve. After this research few investigations followed until 1943. In this year Bryce Ryan and Neal Gross published their study about innovation diffusion. This led to an enormous overflow of publications. Later, Rogers (2003) contributed additional research and many others followed him. ^ When an individual or a company comes up with a new idea, they want this idea to be adopted by all potential users as soon as possible. This spreading of an innovation is called diffusion. According to Rogers (1995) diffusion is: “The process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system”. Therefore, an innovator should spread this message by multiple channels to inform as many people as possible who could be interested in this new idea. When this is done properly, one is able to follow the adoption process and can determine if the innovation is rejected or adopted. So, diffusion is the adoption process of the population. ^ Fisheries bycatch is considered the most serious global threat to marine species, particularly sea turtles. During the past 20 years, the use of different types of fishing gear, especially pelagic longlines (Carranza et al. 2006, Pradhan 2 ̆ 6 Leung 2006, Swimmer et al 2005), have reduced the population of sea turtles and other marine fauna (Peckham et al 2007, Bugoni et al 2008, Alfaro Shingueto et al 2010) due mainly to bycatch (Broderick et al 2006). As a result these species have become subject to intensive conservation efforts. ^ One of our research questions when examining circle hooks was: which factors influence an individual to try a new fishing gear device? Considerable research indicates that attitudes towards an adoption of change are influenced by a number of community and individual level variables (Rogers 2003). Adoption research methods attempt to predict behavior regarding innovations as perceived by potential adopters by assessing acceptability of innovations (Tango-Lowy 2 ̆ 6 Robertson 2002). This technology was introduced to reduce the consequences of fisheries bycatch. ^ In order to reduce the incidental capture of sea turtles in commercial fisheries, NOAA has been studying the efficacy of Bycatch Reduction Devices (BRD) such as circle hooks (CH). Alongside other international agencies, NOAA has supported training and outreach efforts to spread knowledge of proper baiting and hooking techniques since the mid- 90 s. The circle hook NOAA advocates is less likely to be swallowed by sea turtles, reducing the risk of drowning. ^ As a consequence of those findings, the circle hook was introduced in Latin America to replace traditional J-shaped hooks with the purpose of reducing sea turtle bycatch. To see the effects of this BRD on sea turtles in the artisanal long line fisheries of Ecuador, a joint venture project started in 2003 amongst the following agencies: the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC); the World Wild Fund (WWF); the Western Pacific Fishery Management Council (WPRFMC); NOAA; the Ocean Conservancy; the Western Pacific Regional Fishery Management Council (WPRFMC); and the Overseas Fisheries Cooperation Foundation of Japan (OFCF Japan). In addition to the support of these agencies, this program received support from the Ecuadorian government and local organizations, such as: the Undersecretariat of Fishery Resources (SRP); the “Programa Nacional de Observadores Pesqueros de Ecuador” (PROBECUADOR); the “Asociación de Exportadores de Pesca Blanca” (ASOEXPEBLA); the “Federación Nacional de Cooperativas de Pescadores en el Ecuador” (FENACOPEC); the “Escuela de Pesca del Pacífico Oriental” (EPESPO) of Manta; and the Escuela Superior Politécnica del Litoral (ESPOL). All gave their support and participated in different activities, especially training workshops that educated local fishermen concerning circle hooks and trained fishermen in their use. This program grew to become a region-wide bycatch network and the largest regional artisanal fisheries conservation program in Latin America. ^ In order to understand the factors influencing an individual to try a new fishing gear, this study augments existing literature on adoption and diffusion, providing evidence of the importance of learning from individual perceptions regarding the adoption of new technologies. The goals of this study are to determine whether the initiative to promote circle hooks and turtle exclusion devices as turtle conservation tools is well perceived by fishers, and also to learn from them if they significantly reduce or do not reduce the capture and mortality of sea turtles. ^ Although this study has focused on potential issues related to adoption and diffusion of two bycatch reduction devices, there is no doubt that these fishing technologies can be successfully applied as a partial solution to the problem of sea turtle bycatch. Nevertheless, it is through the recognition of potential sociocultural factors and taking steps toward their solution that we can facilitate successful technology transfer wherever and whenever it is needed. ^ The first chapter attempts to identify perceptions of fishers in the transfer technology that affect an individual’s willingness to accept an innovation. Rogers’ theoretical framework forms the basis for adoption research and is used to structure a wide variety of studies such as; organizational culture conflict (Reeves-Ellington 1998), resistance to increase regulations in the shrimp fishery (Johnson et al 1998), and coastal development programs (Aswani 2 ̆ 6 Weiant 2004; Pollnac 2 ̆ 6 Pomeroy 2005). Innovation attributes are the perceived properties of an innovation that influence a potential adopters’ decision (Rogers 2003). Adoption research assesses perception of innovation attributes by potential adopters to better explain adoption practices or how to better design innovations for project participants. In the context of this study, relationships of the factors of attitudes toward fishing, future perspective and perceptions of recovery activities with willingness to participate, were investigated. ^ This approach examines individual perceptions and experience with the transfer technology of circle hooks and how fishers affect acceptance of this innovation. Rogers (2003) suggests that adoption of innovations is more likely if a need exists or it is arises among the members of a community. This approach examines individual perceptions and experience with the transfer technology of circle hooks and how fishers affect acceptance of an innovation in general. Rogers (2003) suggests that adoption of innovations is more likely if a need exists or arises. Future perspective is an individual characteristic that can be an indicator of willingness to adopt an innovation (Rogers 2003). The study area is six villages in the Ecuadorian coast that have knowledge of the existence of this new BRD. ^ Although the effort to transfer circle hook technology has occurred in Ecuador since 2004, there is no doubt that its diffusion process has been slow in most of the fishing towns in this study. Survey results indicate that circle hook adoption in Ecuador is low; only 64 out of 272 informants (23 percent) indicated that they used circle hooks on their boats. Adoption is not easy, especially when the Ecuadorian fishers have spent many years fishing with J hooks. They have time yet to learn and/ or develop adequate techniques to operate with circle hooks, so we can hope that with more time we will see improvements in their catch rates with circle hooks in the future. ^ Chapter two examines the unintended consequences of technology transfer; specifically, circle hooks in fisheries as a conservation initiative that was intended to curb the accidental capture of sea turtles in Ecuadorian longline fisheries. However, results from this study indicate that BRD can have unintended consequences on other species, specifically sharks. The hypothesis of this study is that the presence of an Ecuadorian shark fishery is a consequence of the most recent Government regulation on sharks coupled with a lucrative international shark fin market may create incentives to misuse this technology and target sharks. ^ The goal of this analysis is to determine to what extent the promotion of circle hooks as a turtle conservation tool has led to the unintended consequence of circle hooks, which are highly effective in capturing large species such as tuna and swordfish, being used to exploit a regulation that allows fishers to keep any shark caught as bycatch. Ironically, the very device being promoted to conserve the sea turtles is being exploited to catch shark, a regulated species. This study concludes that fishers purposefully use circle hooks rather than <b>j-hooks</b> as a “work around” to catch regulated shark species as bycatch and within the regulations, keep them. ^ The lucrative trade in shark fins and the incidental established shark fishery in Ecuador provide an incentive to use the circle hook to target sharks. There is no easy solution to this problem. Ecuador, and those at the Inter American Tropical Tuna Commission (IATTC) and World Wildlife Fund (WWF), are in the unenviable position of trying to decide with uncertain science whether to promote a hook that may save sea turtles but put sharks at risk. ^ Finally, chapter three evaluates fishermen’s perceptions regarding the use of the Turtle Excluder Devices (TED), and if this BRD ensures conservation of sea turtles to assure better fisheries management. Actions and decisions regarding any new regulation must be taken with regards to not only scientific information, but also the welfare of all stakeholders involved in one specific fishery. Decisions should not favor one fishery sector or group. Decisions should attempt to favor all the stakeholders as well as the marine resources. ^ Bycatch reduction is a result of the use of more selective fishing gears such as trawl nets equipped with TEDs. Although this device was, in some way, imposed by the US to enforce its use by the Ecuadorian shrimp vessels and to avoid any ban on shrimp exportation, results of this study indicate that 82...|$|R
