500|$|The first National Debt Clock was {{installed}} on February 20, 1989. The national debt stood at [...] dollars that year. The original [...] clock was constructed {{at a cost}} of $100,000. It cost $500 per month to maintain the display's 305 lightbulbs. It was mounted on a now-demolished Durst building at Sixth Avenue near 42nd Street (a block from Times Square), facing the north side of 42nd Street and Bryant Park. Built by the New York sign company Artkraft Strauss, the clock featured a dot-based segment display emulating the then-typical character resolution of 5-by-7. Similar to the second clock, the updating mechanism was such that the display was set to the estimated speed of debt growth (odometer-style) and adjusted weekly according to the latest numbers published by the United States Treasury. Seymour Durst vowed that the clock would [...] "be up as long as the debt or the city lasts," [...] and that [...] "if <b>it</b> <b>bothers</b> people, then it's working." ...|$|E
500|$|On June 16, 2007, 200 people {{gathered}} in a protest organized by Pro Cologne against the mosque including representatives from the Austrian Freedom Party and the Belgian Vlaams Belang. Then district deputy mayor Uckermann seconded that he thinks many residents reject the mosque {{because they believe that}} Cologne is a “Christian city”. The prominent author Ralph Giordano stated that he opposed the project as the mosque would be “an expression of the creeping Islamization of our land”, a “declaration of war”, and that he wouldn't want to see women wearing headscarfs on German streets, likening their appearance to “human penguins”. Henryk M. Broder, a journalist, disagrees with Giordano's metaphor but said that “A mosque is more than a church or a synagogue. It is a political statement.” Giordano's remarks have turned the local dispute into a national debate about the place of Islam in Germany. and other prominent Germans criticized the project as well. District mayor Uckermann stated that Giordano's comments “broke down the wall. Before if you criticised this monstrous mosque you were a Nazi. But we {{have a problem with the}} integration of Muslims. It's a question of language and culture.” Uckermann left the conservative CDU for right-wing Pro Cologne in 2008 after being voted out of office as the district's deputy mayor and reportedly facing party exclusion.The city's official for integration Marlis Bredehorst stated that [...] "it is important that the Muslims here get dignified houses of prayer" [...] and added that [...] "two hundred years ago, the Protestants had to pray secretively in Catholic Cologne [...] that is something we can't imagine anymore today." [...] The city's mayor, Fritz Schramma, who supports the project said that “For me, it is self-evident that the Muslims need to have a prestigious place of worship, but <b>it</b> <b>bothers</b> me when people have lived here for 35 years and they don’t speak a single word of German.” Christian leaders have taken similarly ambivalent stances: the Catholic Church has long supported the project, though recently Cardinal Joachim Meisner, Archbishop of Cologne, has been more cautious: when asked if he was afraid of the mosque, he said, “I don't want to say I'm afraid, but I have an uneasy feeling.” He also stated that Turkey should allow its Christian minorities equivalent rights. He said the mosque would change the skyline of Cologne. Wolfgang Huber, Germany's top Protestant bishop, criticized the “male domination” he saw in Islam and said Muslims should be able to convert to Christianity without fearing reprisals and the penalty of death.|$|E

2500|$|Wilson is {{afflicted with}} {{schizoaffective}} disorder that presents {{itself in the}} form of disembodied voices (auditory hallucinations). The illness emerged a week after his first LSD consumption. It formed a major component of Bill Pohlad's Love & Mercy (2014), a biographical film which depicts Wilson's hallucinations as a source of musical inspiration, constructing songs that were partly designed to converse with them. Wilson has said of the voices: [...] "Mostly [...] derogatory. Some of it's cheerful. Most of it isn't." [...] He added that his hallucinations will inspire a song [...] "every now and then". In 2002, Wilson felt that his successful treatment initiated a writer's block: [...] "I haven't been able to write anything for three years. I think I need the demons in order to write, but the demons have gone. <b>It</b> <b>bothers</b> me a lot. I've tried and tried, but I just can't seem to find a melody." ...|$|E
2500|$|Clarkson {{described}} the fifth song and title track [...] "Piece by Piece" [...] as her most personal {{song on the}} album. It was produced by Kurstin, who co-wrote the song with Clarkson after a conversation she had with her sister about their family life. The sixth song, [...] "Run Run Run", features American recording artist John Legend. Produced by Jason Halbert, {{it was written by}} Tim James, Antonina Armato, Joacim Persson, Ry Cuming, and David Jost. Clarkson and Legend had previously worked together on the short-lived American television program Duets in 2012. Originally deeming it to be a solo record, Clarkson invited Legend to turn the track into a duet after recording her part during the 2013 Honda Civic Tour. Legend responded within ten minutes, saying: [...] "Oh my God, I'd love to do it. Send me the file!" [...] "Run Run Run" [...] was also recorded by the German rock band Tokio Hotel for their fifth studio album Kings of Suburbia (2014), which Clarkson was unfamiliar with until releasing her version of the song. Clarkson co-wrote the seventh track [...] "I Had a Dream" [...] with Kurstin (who also produced it) after lamenting with her friends about the dichotomy that exists between expectations and reality and her disappointment in their generation. Clarkson bemoaned: [...] "I don't understand why we're still struggling with these basic, asinine issues [...] <b>It</b> <b>bothers</b> me. So I ended up writing this whole song about it and I had a dream that we were more." [...] The song features a [...] "gospely chorus." ...|$|E

And with what one sees, on one side, with its tongue in its cheek, defying one to be real enough, and on the other the bonnes gens rolling up their eyes at one's cynicism, the situation has elements of the ludicrous which the artist himself is doubtless in a position to appreciate better than any one else. Of course one mustn't bother about the bonnes gens." [...] Mark Ambient went on, while my thoughts reverted to his ladylike wife, as interpreted by his remarkable sister.|$|E

60|$|Nothing, however, has {{yet been}} said {{of one of the}} most salient {{characteristics}} of Esmond—one, perhaps, which has had as much to do with the love of its lovers and the qualified esteem of those who do not quite love it, as anything else. This is, of course, the attempt, certainly a very audacious one, at once to give the very form and pressure of the time of the story—sometimes in actual diction—and yet to suffuse it with a modern thought and colour which most certainly were not of the time. The boldness and the peril of this attempt are both quite indisputable; and the peril itself is, in a way, double. There is the malcontent who will say “This may be all very fine: but I don’t like it. <b>It</b> <b>bothers</b> and teases me. I do not want to be talked to in the language of Addison and Steele”. And there will be the possibly less ingenuous but more obtrusive malcontent who will say that it ought never to have been done, or that it is not, as it is, done well. With the first, who probably exists “in squadrons and gross bands”, argument is, of course, impossible. He may be taught better if he is caught young, but that is all: and certainly the last thing that any honest lover of literature would wish would be to make him say that he likes a thing when he does not. That may be left to those who preach and follow the fashions of the moment. Nor, perhaps, is there very much to do with those who say that the double attempt is not successful—except to disable their judgement. But as for the doctrine that this attempt deserves to fail, and must fail—that it is wrong in itself—there one may take up the cudgels with some confidence.|$|E
