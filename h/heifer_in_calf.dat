40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine factors that are associated with the birth size of Holstein calves. A retrospective cross-sectional study was set up, and data of 1594 calf births from four dairy herds in Belgium and one in Germany were analyzed. Of the variables offered to the offspring birth weight (BW) model <b>in</b> <b>heifers,</b> <b>calf</b> gender, gestation length, season of calving, age at calving and heart girth, wither height and diagonal length of the dam were retained as significant. The BW was significantly lower <b>in</b> <b>heifers</b> that calved at a very old age (25. 5 to 37. 3 months) (P < 0. 001). Calves born out of young (20. 3 to < 22 months) and old (23. 3 to 25. 5 months) heifers were lighter than calves born out of intermediately aged (22 to < 23. 5 months) heifers. Of the variables offered to the offspring BW model <b>in</b> cows, <b>calf</b> gender, season of calving, gestation length, parity, length of the dry period and the milk production during gestation (MGEST) were significant. For cows having the same heart girth, the BW of the calves was 0. 97 and 1. 11 kg higher in cows with low (1, 400 to < 5, 400 kg) and high (6, 500 to < 7, 200) MGEST, respectively, than in cows with very high MGEST (7, 200 to 11, 600 kg) (P < 0. 05).

40|$|The {{present study}} was {{conducted}} to evaluate reproductive performance of Ethiopian Boran cows at Abernosa ranch in the production of Boron x Holstein-Friesian Ft crossbred dairy heifers for distribution to smallholder farmers. Performance data from the ranch between 1993 and 2001 was used for this study. The results show delayed age at first conception (53. 9 months) and long'calving interval (534. 3 days), with average breeding efficiency of 44. 6 %, average calving rate of 72 % and heifer production efficiency of only 38 %. The pre and post weaning calf mortality rates were 17. 3 and 2. 9 %, respectively. These led to a very low average cost recovery on <b>in</b> <b>calf</b> <b>heifer</b> production of only 14. 6 %. Based on the average herd productivity parameters determined in this study, it was calculated that this rate of cost recovery could be improved three fold to 42. 8 % by introducing such realistic management interventions as replacement of old and unproductive cows with average performing ones, enforcing a clearly defined breeding practice, managing open cows and heifers separately for better beat detection, supplementary feeding and timely mating, and full utilization of the available resources for the key output of the ranch - in-calf crossbred heifers. Furthermore, between 1994 and 2000, annually on average 20 % of the crossbred heifers were culled for health difficulties, physical injury and unknown reasons. If this rather high culling rate could be reduced by half through separate and proper management of heifers, the number of available heifers for mating could be increased by 15. 4 %, and with this, also the number of <b>in</b> <b>calf</b> <b>heifers</b> available for distribution. Overall, it was noted that the production of <b>in</b> <b>calf</b> crossbred <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> the ranch has been very inefficient. It was therefore recommended that alternative ways of producing crossbred heifers such as contract production with smallholder farmers or commercial farmers and direct production of crossbred <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> the hands of smallholder farmers who own suitable indigenous cows should be considered for more economical production of crossbred heifers...|$|R
40|$|A new {{protocol}} for superovulating cattle {{which allows for}} control of the timing of ovulation after superstimulation with FSH was developed.

40|$|Livestock grazing on outfield {{pastures}} {{to utilize}} inexpensive forage and save infield pastures to harvest winter feed {{is an important}} focus topic in Norwegian agriculture. It {{is important for the}} health and biodiversity of native grassland communities to be maintained to prevent secondary succession. One method of grassland management is grazing cattle on outfield pastures. This develops a symbiotic relationship where native grassland is maintained while cattle are nourished without sacrificing their growth and development. In Ringsaker and Vang almenning areas of Hedmark County, three dairy farms practice summer grazing on outfield pastures and allowed 41 of their Norwegian Red <b>heifers</b> to participate <b>in</b> this study. One farm allowed their heifers to forage freely (O-group) and the other farms had <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> a restricted area (P-group). The aim {{of this study was to}} identify if an outfield grazing production system could support those heifers growth, body weight, and body condition as recommended by the Norwegian dairy coop Tine. Subsequently, I measured both live body weight and body condition of those 41 heifers. The results indicated that the only heifers that gained body weight during the grazing season were those heifers that originated from the open grazing production system (O-group). The <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> the O-group gained on average 17. 4 kg while grazing on outfield pastures. Those <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> the O-group were also the closest to the suggested weight recommended by Tine, with an average of 28. 3 kg below the recommended weight for heifers’ respected ages. The <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> the Pen grazing production system (P-group) lost an extensive amount of weight. <b>Heifers</b> <b>in</b> the P-group lost on average 60. 9 kg, and were also 95 kg below their recommended Tine weight. In addition, this study also found a negative correlation between overweight heifers at the start of the grazing season and percentage body weight loss.

40|$|The {{synchrony}} of ovulation {{was examined}} <b>in</b> superstimulated <b>heifers</b> {{that had a}} downregulated pituitary gland and which were induced to ovulate by injection of exogenous LH. The pituitary was downregulated and desensitized to GnRH by treatment with the GnRH agonist deslorelin. Nulliparous heifers (3. 5 yr old) at random stages of the estrous cycle were assigned to 1 of 3 groups, and on Day - 7 received the following treatments: Group 1 (control, n= 8), 1 norgestomet ear implant; Group 2 (GnRH agonist, n= 8); Group 3 (GnRH agonist-LH protocol, n= 8), 2 deslorelin ear implants. Ovarian follicle growth <b>in</b> all <b>heifers</b> was superstimulated with twice-daily intramuscular injections of FSH (Folltropin-V ®) : Day 0, 40 mg (80 mg total dose); Day 1, 30 mg; Day 2; 20 mg; Day 3, 10 mg. On Day 2, all heifers were given a luteolytic dose of PGF (7 A. M.), Norgestomet implants were removed from <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> Group 1 (6 P. M.). <b>Heifers</b> <b>in</b> Group 3 were given an injection of 25 mg, im porcine LH (Lutropin ®) on Day 4 (4 P. M.). Ovarian follicle status was monitored at 8 - h intervals from Day 3 (8 A. M.) to Day 6 (4 P. M.) using an Aloka Echo Camera and 7. 5 MHz transducer. <b>Heifers</b> <b>in</b> Groups 2 and 3 exhibited estrus earlier (P < 0. 05) than <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> Group 1. <b>Heifers</b> <b>in</b> Group 2 {{did not have a}} preovulatory LH surge and they did not ovulate.

It was also demonstrated that ovulation is closely synchronized after injection of LH. Thus, a single, fixed-time insemination schedule could be used in a GnRH agonist-LH superovulation protocol, with significant practical and economic advantages for superovulation and embryo transfer programs...|$|R

At the start of the study, heifers (3 year old) were implanted with GnRH agonist (. n = 20) or received no treatment (control, n = 5). After 6 months, follicular growth <b>in</b> <b>heifers</b> implanted with GnRH agonist was restricted to early antral follicles (2 - 4 mm). At this time, these heifers were allocated to four groups and follicular development was superstimulated with FSH as follows: group 1 (. n = 5) and group 2 (. n = 5), a conventional FSH protocol with injections over 4 days (Days 0 - 3) with Group 2 receiving two times the normal dose of FSH; group 3 (. n = 5), a single injection of FSH in saline on Day 0; group 4 (. n= 5), a single injection of FSH in slow-release polyvinylpyrrolidone on Day 0. Follicular growth <b>in</b> the control <b>heifers</b> (. n = 5) was superstimulated using the conventional 4 -day FSH protocol. On Day 5, <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> groups 1 and 2 had similar (P > 0. 05) numbers of follicles in the size categories 6 to 7 mm (12. 8 ± 3. 0 follicles) and 8 to 9 mm (6. 5 ± 1. 0) as control heifers (6 - 7 mm, 14. 6 ± 2. 2; 8 - 9 mm, 6. 2 ± 2. 2) and six of the former heifers had follicles 10 mm (3. 2 ± 1. 4). Also on Day 5, follicular growth for <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> group 3 was restricted to 4 to 5 mm (11. 6 ± 3. 0) and 6 to 7 mm (7. 6 ± 3. 7), whereas four out of five <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> group 4 had follicles of 6 to 7 mm (8. 2 ± 2. 3) and three heifers had follicles of 8 to 9 mm (4. 6 ± 2. 2) and 10 mm (2. 2 ± 0. 9). Injection of exogenous LH on Day 5 induced ovulation in 9 out of 10 <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> groups 1 and 2, no <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> group 3, and 2 of 5 <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> group 4.

Behavior data were collected every 15 minutes from 8 : 30 h to 16 h. Shade availability significantly impacted heifer behavior, mainly affecting grazing frequency and time during the hottest hours.

In 2001 (yr 1) and 2002 (yr 2), forage was {{harvested}} from these fields as hay in two cuttings and stockpiled for winter grazing beginning in early August. Each field {{was divided into}} four pastures of 6. 25 or 8. 75 acres subdivided into 8 paddocks. On November 7 and October 23 of yr 1 and 2, 24 Angus and Angus x Simmental <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> mid-gestation were allotted to the eight pastures to strip-graze stockpiled forage and 8 similar <b>heifers</b> were placed <b>in</b> a dry lot to be fed hay. Corn gluten feed was supplemented to <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> pastures at each stocking rate and in the two dry lots at levels to meet the target weight gains for pregnancy and growth while <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> the remaining pastures were supplemented at levels to meet the target weight gains for pregnancy only. Mean seasonal concentrations of in vitro digestible dry matter (IVDMD) were greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) and concentrations of neutral detergent fiber (NDF), acid detergent fiber (ADF), and acid detergent insoluble nitrogen (ADIN) were lower (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) in stockpiled forage than hay. Average daily gains and body condition score increases of heifers grazing stockpiled forage were greater (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) than <b>heifers</b> fed hay <b>in</b> a dry lot even though heifers grazing stockpiled forage required 49 and 90...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} feeding a diet {{restricted}} in energy on the endocrine mechanisms regulating LI-I secretion <b>in</b> prepubertal <b>heifers</b> were examined. On Day 0, thirty heifers {{were assigned to}} be either ovariectomized (OVX; n = 10), ovariectomized and admin-istered an estradiol implant (OVXE; n = 10), or to remain ovary-intact ([NT, n = 10). Five heifers each were then assigned to be fed either a control (C) or a two-phase, low-to-high energy (L), dietary treatment. The C diet was formulated to support weight gains of 1. 1 kg/day throughout the experiment (Day 0 - 197). Heifers receiving the L treatment were provided a diet restricted in energy (33 % of C diet) from Day 0 - 127 followed by a diet similar to that fed to heifers receiving the C treatment from Day 128 - 197. Secretion of LII increased rapidly following ovariectomy in C-OVX and L-OVX heifers. During the period of energy restriction, LH pulse frequency was reduced, and mean LII concentration, pulse amplitude, and pituitary response to LHR}I were greater in L-OVX than <b>in</b> C-OVX <b>heifers.</b> <b>In</b> L-OVXE and LINT heifers, secretion of LH was low and unchanged {{during the period of}} dietary energy restriction. In contemporaneous treatment groups fed the C diet (C-OVXE and C-INT), frequency of LH pulses increased gradually during this period and C-tNT heifers attained puberty on Day 121 ± 18. Upon switching <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> the L-OVX, L-OVXE, and L-INT treatments to the C diet, all characteristics of LH secretion changed markedly within 14 days to levels similar to those detected in the C treatments. Day of puberty for <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> the L-INT treatment (141 ± 6) was not different from Day of puberty for <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> the C-tNT treatment. It is concluded that dietary energy restriction sustained inhibition of LH secretion <b>in</b> OVXE <b>heifers</b> and <b>in</b> [NT <b>heifers.</b> Additionally, dietary energy restriction inhibited UI secretion independent of ovarian factors <b>in</b> prepubertal <b>heifers...</b>|$|R
25|$|Some Fundamentalist Christians {{believe that}} the Second Coming of Jesus Christ cannot occur until the Third Temple is {{constructed}} in Jerusalem, which requires {{the appearance of a}} red <b>heifer</b> born <b>in</b> Israel.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to gain an {{improved}} understanding of the relationships between body weight (BW), body condition (BCS), and metabolic homeostasis, and the attainment of puberty <b>in</b> Brahman <b>heifers</b> <b>in</b> a subtropical environment. Brahman heifers (200. ±. 3. kg BW; 2. 00. ±. 0. 0 BCS) were assigned to a moderate nutrition (MN, n= 11) or improved nutrition (IN, n= 11) treatment from 11 to 23 months-of-age. The heifers were monitored at regular intervals for circulating concentrations of GH, IGF- 1, insulin, glucose and leptin, and ovarian follicular activity was recorded until the first ovulation. From approximately 16 months of age, <b>heifers</b> on <b>IN</b> had a greater (P< 0. 01) BW and greater (P< 0. 01) BCS than heifers on MN. <b>Heifers</b> on <b>IN</b> also had a generally improved metabolic homeostasis than heifers on MN which was reflected in greater circulating concentrations of insulin, leptin, IGF- 1 and glucose <b>in</b> the former <b>heifers.</b> <b>Heifers</b> on <b>IN</b> attained puberty between 21 and 23 months of age and only one heifer on MN had reached puberty by 23 months.
