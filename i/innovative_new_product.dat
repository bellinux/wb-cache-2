40|$|The {{traditional}} goods-dominant {{logic of}} marketing is under challenge and leading researchers are now emphasizing the new service-dominant logic [Vargo, S. L., Lusch, R. F., Evolving {{to a new}} dominant logic for marketing. J Mark 2004; 68 (1) : 1 - 17. ]. One of the key foundational propositions of this logic is the customer as "always being a co-creator of value" where "the brand becomes the experience" [Prahalad, C. K., The co-creation of value. J Mark 2004; 68 (1) : 23. ]. In this paper, the authors examine the concept of brand relationship experience {{in the context of}} co-creation and service-dominant logic and outline a conceptual model for designing and managing the customer experience.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. This paper reviews {{some aspects of}} the {{performance}} of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in responding to innovation and technological change when undertaking new product development. Focusing on the management of technology, it will consider the role of interaction and collective learning in building firm competencies. Through the development of new or existing technologies, firms aim to improve quality and cost-efficiency and to out-innovate their rivals. This is far from straightforward. Innovation is a complex process shaped not only by the firm's internal environment, but also by the interactions that occur between the firm and the many different actors and institutions that make up its external environment. Many SMEs appreciate the value of these interactions in promoting innovation. However, for those involved in <b>innovative</b> <b>new</b> <b>product</b> development they also bring with them associated risks such as, for example, a lower proportion of return on their technologies brought about by imitation by their rivals...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasingly}} {{important role of}} SMEs in both regional and national economic development has been widely acknowledged in the economic and entrepreneurship literature. The development of an economic and policy environment supporting new, high-growth, high-technology ventures has become common strategy adopted by many policy makers, as a critical means of promoting future economic growth and job creation. Many of these high-technology, economic development programmes embrace enabling technologies, such as micro- and nanotechnology- based fi rms. Although nascent entrepreneurs have numerous sources of advice and support as they embark on the venture creation pathway, aspects of an entrepreneur’s past and present experience exert a central and often pivotal infl uence {{on their ability to}} engage effectively in opportunity recognition and exploitation of <b>innovative</b> <b>new</b> <b>product</b> technologies. This article argues that the professional/social environment in which an entrepreneur lives and works has a fundamental impact upon their ability to recognize and exploit opportunities.

40|$|Abstract- In the {{development}} trajectory of Chinese software industry, software parks as industry clusters located in different cities, {{have played a}} leading role and received increasing attention with competitive advantages, which are originally from substantial supportive local institutional systems. This paper attempts to explore the competitive advantage of Chinese software parks for promoting industrial development. These industry clusters provide competitive advantage because they are rooted in local institutional systems. Taking the case of Dalian Software Park in China, this analysis is conducted qualitatively based on Porter’s “diamond ” model, SWOT framework and interview results. Industry clusters, which encompass a series of interconnected firms in designated geographic concentrations, show competitive advantages for industrial development with substantial resources rooted in local institutional systems including government, industry and academia aspects. In order to successfully navigate the economic paradigm shift from mass manufacturing production to <b>innovative</b> <b>new</b> <b>product</b> development in China, it is essential that the competitive advantages of industry clusters are strengthened and sustained in order to enhance industrial development, generate innovation and increase regional economic growth...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{influence}} of innovator roles in highly innovative ventures. In order to obtain a differentiated picture we {{take into account the}} degree of innovativeness as a moderating variable. To test our hypotheses we use a sample of 146 highly <b>innovative</b> <b>new</b> <b>product</b> development projects. We choose a rigorous sampling design and apply state-of-the-art measures for the degree of innovativeness. Furthermore, we apply multi-trait-multi-method methodology (MTMM) to enhance the validity of our study. The results show that innovator roles have a strong influence on innovation success but these influences are posi-tively and negatively moderated by innovativeness. The moderating influences depend on the type of innovativeness. Remarkably, with increasing technological innovativeness innovator roles which create inter-organizational links with the outside world appear to be more impor-tant than intra-organizational linker roles, and support from high-ranked organizational members turns out to have a significant negative effect on project success with higher degrees of technological innovativeness. Possible explanations for these findings are discussed and consequences for innovation research and innovation management are shown...|$|E

40|$|The Juster scale - a simple, {{self-reported}} {{measure of}} purchase probability, {{has been shown}} to be effective in predicting consumers 2 ̆ 7 future purchasing behaviours. Purchase probability scales have often been shown to be better predictors of future behaviour than purchase intentions measures, the more widely used method. The vast majority of studies though have used the scale to predict the purchase of products or services the consumer is already familiar with. This research looks at how accurately the Juster scale can predict early adoption of an <b>innovative</b> <b>new</b> <b>product</b> prior to its’ launch. In a longitudinal study of market behaviour, these predictions are compared to actual adoption rates. The results show that there is only a moderate level of correlation between purchase probability scores and actual adoption behaviour, in both the short and long term, but they are better than intention measures. The main difficulty in predicting adoption behaviour seems to stem from consumers inability to foresee intervening situational factors, rather than inaccuracies in the probability scale itself. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Using a revelatory case study, I {{propose a}} new concept – the Born Open (BO). I use the case to reflect open {{innovation}} (OI) practices in a hi-tech start-up. My observations differentiate from current studies of OI in SMEs because I consider a) {{the point in the}} lifecycle of the firm in which OI and open business models are seriously contemplated and b) the role of entrepreneurial cognition and intent towards open innovation from the founding of the firm. I draw upon academic literatures in open innovation, open business models, international entrepreneurship, managerial cognition, and effectuation and causation theories to provide theoretical foundations to my empirical observations. I put forward a series of propositions regarding the characteristics of a BO firm and a working definition as a foundation for future research. I suggest that in the current fast paced environment, entrepreneurial founders may need to view an open business model as a necessity at the ideation stage of an <b>innovative</b> <b>new</b> <b>product,</b> but that finding partners who comprehend the enhanced value such a business model brings to itself as well as the value network overall, may be difficult and require persistence...|$|E

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. This paper explores {{the ways in}} which a product design student's idea for an <b>innovative</b> <b>new</b> <b>product,</b> with {{considered}} real commercial potential, was taken to manufacturing industry. It is based on a student concept for an innovative adjustable hairbrush design that has been developed and submitted to relevant industries for their consideration. The idea has now been both patented and exclusively licensed to a company, Albyn of Stonehaven Ltd, for manufacture and sales of the product. The areas reviewed and discussed in detail are concept development to a standard for both industrial presentation and Patent application, concept presentation with a view to licensing the product and the progression of discussions and negotiations for a licence agreement. More importantly, the impact of all of these areas in terms of both the tutor and student learning experience is reviewed. The particular benefits that can be derived are critically evaluated, with a view to demonstrating how these benefits are not just applicable to these two parties, but also how they can be integrated as an improvement to the course of study as a whole...|$|E
40|$|Strategic leaders hold {{different}} beliefs {{regarding how}} much to invest in technological innovation, and how to manage it. While certain visionary leaders have created extraordinarily innovative organizations, little evidence exists regarding {{the degree to which}} strategic leaders generally influence the production of valuable inventions and new products. We examine how much of the variation in firms’ inventive (patent) and <b>innovative</b> (<b>new</b> <b>product)</b> performance strategic leaders explain. Based on a sample of Chief Executive Officers (CEOs) and Chief Scientific Officers (CSOs) who managed 27 large biopharmaceutical companies, from 1984 through 2004, we find that strategic leaders explain between 38 % and 43 % of the variation in inventive performance across firms, and that CEOs explain more of this variation than do CSOs. Stable firm characteristics are responsible for 27 % of the variation in firms’ inventive performance. By contrast, 51 % of the variation in innovative performance is attributable to firm differences, and CEOs and CSOs explain less than 4 % of this. Finally, we show that CEOs and CSOs strongly influence {{the degree to which a}} firm derives inventive advantage from internal and external knowledge diversity...|$|E
40|$|Scrum {{was invented}} to rapidly drive <b>innovative</b> <b>new</b> <b>product</b> to market. Six month {{releases}} {{used to be}} a reasonable time from for an enterprise system. Now it is three months for a major new release, one month for upgrades, and one week for maintenance releases. The initial version of the Agile Scrum development process was designed to enhance productivity and reduce time to market for new product. In this paper, one of the inventors of Scrum goes back to Scrum basics, throws out preconceived notions, and designs Advanced Scrum using multiple overlapping Sprints within the same Scrum teams. This methodology delivers increasing application functionality to market at a pace that overwhelms competitors. To capture dominant market share in 2005 requires a metaScrum for release planning, variable length Sprints, overlapping Sprints for a single team, prestaging Product Backlog, daily Scrum of Scrums meetings, and automation and integration of Product Backlog and Sprint Backlog with real-time reporting. A practical example of Advanced Scrum describes how mobile/wireless product teams implemented Scrum process automation during 2000 - 2005.
