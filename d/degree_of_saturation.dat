40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{capability}} of drinks and foods to resist pH changes {{brought about by}} salivary buffering may {{play an important role}} in the dental erosion process in children. The aim of the present study was to test fruit yogurt, a popular snack for children, and the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>saturation</b> (pK-pl) with respect to hydroxyapatite and fluorapatite to determine their erosive potential. METHOD AND MATERIALS: A variety of fruit yogurt was tested. To test the pH, 8 readings were taken with a pH electrode for each yogurt. Calcium content was detected by atomic absorption spectrophotometer, phosphorus by the inductively coupled plasma method, and fluoride content by ion chromatography. The <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> hydroxyapatite and fluorapatite were calculated by use of a computer program. Statistical analysis was performed using 2 -tailed analysis of variance (P <. 05) and a post hoc test (Tukey) to determine differences between groups. RESULTS: The pH of each fruit concentrate was significantly different, except for banana yogurt. Except for the phosphorus content of raspberry yogurt, the calcium and phosphorus content for each fruit concentrate were significantly different. Fluoride levels were the same for all yogurts tested, and the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>saturation</b> <b>of</b> hydroxyapatite and fluorapatite was positive, indicating supersaturation.

Freezing air down to [...] promotes planar crystals (thin and flat). In colder air down to , the crystals form as needles, hollow columns, prisms or needles. In air as cold as , shapes become plate-like again, often with branched or dendritic features. At temperatures below , the crystals becomes plate-like or columnar, depending on the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>saturation.</b> As Nakaya discovered, shape is also a function of whether the prevalent moisture is above or below saturation. Forms below the saturation line trend more towards solid and compact. Crystals formed in supersaturated air trend more towards lacy, delicate and ornate. Many more complex growth patterns also form such as side-planes, bullet-rosettes and also planar types depending on the conditions and ice nuclei. If a crystal has started forming in a column growth regime, at around , and then falls into the warmer plate-like regime, then plate or dendritic crystals sprout {{at the end of}} the column, producing so called [...] "capped columns".|$|E

40|$|Unsaturated {{hydraulic}} (K) {{and electrical}} (σ_b) conductivity are often considered durability indicators of cement-based materials. However, K {{is difficult to}} measure experimentally. This {{is due to the}} large pressure requirements at low <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>saturation</b> resulting from the fine pore-size distribution of cement-based materials. As a result, the commonly-used analytical models, requiring calibration of K from experimental data, are often inaccurate at low <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>saturation.</b> On the other hand, measuring σ_b is rather straight forward. Descriptions of the relationship between σ_b and K may therefore be particularly valuable when K is required. In this work, we use experimental data from previous works to determine the feasibility of models employing a van Genuchten-Mualem based framework to predict K and σ_b as a function <b>of</b> <b>saturation,</b> pore-size distribution, and porosity. We then develop analytical expressions relating K and σ_b using these models. It is then shown that K = K(σ_b) and σ_b = σ_b(K) may be determined when either parameter is fully described.

40|$|Effects of the {{embedded}} {{monopile foundation}} {{on the local}} distributions of pore water pressure, soil stresses, and liquefaction are investigated in this study using a three-dimensional integrated numerical model. The model {{is based on a}} Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes wave module and a fully dynamic poroelastic seabed module and has been validated with the analytical solution and experimental data. Results show that, compared to the situation without an embedded foundation, the embedded monopile foundation increases and decreases the maximum pore water pressure in the seabed around and below the foundation, respectively. The embedded monopile foundation also significantly modifies the distributions of the maximum effective soil stress around the foundation and causes a local concentration of soil stress below the two lower corners of foundation. A parametric study reveals that the effects of embedded monopile foundation on pore water pressure increase as the <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>saturation</b> and soil permeability decrease. The embedded monopile foundation tends to decrease the liquefaction depth around the structure, and this effect is relatively more obvious for greater <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>saturation,</b> greater soil permeabilities, and smaller wave heights...|$|R
