40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this cross {{sectional}} study is to investigate student perceptions of learning environments at a major Australian University. Various aspects of environment are compared between courses, year levels, educational backgrounds and gender. Methods: The Dundee Ready Education Environment Measure (DREEM) and a demographic questionnaire were completed by 548 undergraduate {{students enrolled in the}} emergency health, midwifery, radiography and medical imaging, occupational therapy, pharmacy, nutrition and dietetics, physiotherapy and social work courses at Monash University. Convenience sampling was used and scores were compared across grouping variables identified via demographic information. Results: Scores across the sample were fairly high (M = 137. 3; SD = 18. 3), indicating an overall positive perception of learning <b>environments</b> <b>among</b> <b>students.</b> Total scores were significantly higher for females (M = 138. 8; SD = 17. 2) than males (M = 132. 3; SD = 20. 7; t[sub](545) [/sub] = 3. 51; p = 0. 002) and this trend was consistent across all aspects of perceived learning environment (although not always significant). Students who enrolled in their course directly after completing high school yielded less positive ratings on some DREEM subscales than students who did not enrol immediately after completing high school. Conclusions: The positive perception held by Monash University health science students towards their education and learning environments is hopefully indicative of similar courses within Australia and internationally. While future studies may help confirm this, the current findings offer a chance to explore the underlying causes of this positivity in more depth as well as compare similarities and differences between the specific health science disciplines...|$|E

Teachers are urged to blend informal and formal learning and since most people informally use curation in their daily lives for compiling relevant information, it may be fairly easy to adopt digital curation in teaching and learning. Teachers, however, require considerable insight in incorporating various informal digital curation tools in educational practices. The SECTIONS model may assist in guiding decisions around the suitability of digital curation tools for a higher education environment. Including digital literacy training in the professional development of academic staff members may sensitize them to the possibilities that incorporating digital approaches in curricula offer. The Five Cs of Digital Curation framework may guide academic staff members in compiling suitable digital material.

Or are there more possibilities {{in other areas}} as well? It was expected that using online social networks can enhance knowledge and learning in other subjects as well, because of the many opportunities they provide for intercultural and inter linguistic communication. Probably, the effects on engagement and motivation will not only occur in language learning, but also in other domains. Further research is needed. Similarly to the other researchers mentioned above, it has been possible to demonstrate that online social networks are useful educational tools for learning languages. It is impossible to discuss the effects on learning without having more concrete data from actual working and learning in the environment of these networks. Most other studies only investigated attitudes or experiences of teachers and students. Roblyer et al.

We follow recent {{scholarly}} {{literature in}} approaching environment as connection, not as some category of reality, and consider pedagogical implications via concept mapping. Concept maps potentially offer a visually explicit means of representing and analyzing the hybrid connections between actors that define environmental issues. We explore {{the utility of}} concept mapping as pioneered by Joseph Novak and others via the CmapTools application, in which concept maps (cmaps) consist of concepts (boxes or nouns) connected by propositions (arrows or verbs); both can include linked resources, and the resultant cmap can be collaboratively edited and shared online. We evaluate concept mapping {{in the context of}} a sophomorelevel environmental methods course taught annually at Lewis & Clark College. The course includes a variety of concept mapping exercises designed for students to reflect on their environmental perspectives, synthesize course material, and explore a proposed topic for environmental research. These exercises were evaluated in fall 2010 using self-reports, assessment rubrics, and openended student responses.

An online survey captured data used to explore the relationships among variables shown to describe a CoP in field <b>environments</b> and <b>among</b> <b>student</b> perceptions of their experience in the course culture. A canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and commonality analysis (CA) were conducted using five predictor variables and three criterion variables to evaluate the degree {{and direction of the}} relationships. The CCA revealed that the full model was significant, explaining approximately 74 % of the variance among the two synthetic variates.

40|$|CONTEXT: The {{clinical}} learning climate affects undergraduate medical students' behaviour, {{satisfaction and}} success. Most studies predominantly describe {{aspects of the}} clinical learning climate using quantitative methodologies, such as questionnaires. This study aimed to illuminate medical students' perceptions of the clinical learning climate, and which factors and their interactions explain differences in clinical learning climates. METHODS: We carried out a multi-method case study. Twelve departments of obstetrics and gynaecology distributed the Postgraduate Hospital Educational Environment Measure (PHEEM), a reliable questionnaire measuring the clinical learning <b>environment,</b> <b>among</b> medical <b>students.</b> After analysis (using anova and post hoc tests), 14 medical students from the highest- and lowest-scoring departments participated in semi-structured interviews. We analysed the transcribed recordings using a content analysis approach. Researchers agreed on coding and an expert group reached consensus on the themes of the analysis. RESULTS: We found {{a significant difference between}} departments in PHEEM scores. The interviews indicated that department and medical student characteristics determine the clinical learning climate. For departments, 'legitimacy', 'clerkship arrangements' and 'focus on personal development' were the main themes. For medical students, 'initial initiatives', 'continuing development' and 'clerkship fatigue' were the principal themes. The amount and nature of participation {{played a central role in}} all themes. CONCLUSIONS: Differences between clinical learning climates appear to be related to differing approaches to participation among departments. Participation depends on characteristics of both departments and students, and the interactions among them.

40|$|This {{research}} has been developed to {{emphasize the importance of}} fun activities in a teaching-learning process. Fun activities are defined as a form of playing with rules, goals, competitions, relaxations, and learning. Teachers can use fun activities as integral part of learning. These forms of activities have many benefits for the teachers as well as the students in improving skills. We can also say that fun activities are an important tool in English classrooms; they are the essential resource to encourage students to develop skills like reading. Students, in this light, forget that they are learning and think of the learning activities as only a fun game thus pressing more attention to the material. The research will also review the effectiveness of different lesson plans as well as how fun activities should be used within the classroom. This investigation contains four lesson plans to work with beginner students from ten to twelve. The activities in the lesson plans are for practicing adjectives, nouns, present tense, and past tense.

Authentic learning practice has a potential to improve problem solving competency by creating a meaningful learning <b>environment</b> <b>among</b> school <b>students.</b> This conceptual framework incorporates two established models; model of problem solving instruction: Search, Solve, Create and Share (Pizzini, 1987) and model of authentic learning (Herrington, 2000) with Science Framework in Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) by The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (2012). Authentic practice in learning chemistry will enhance higher order thinking skills especially to solve the open-ended problems. Open-ended problem is an ill-defined and non-routine problem, which is presenting a real-life context that interesting and relevant to the students. Student’s prior scientific knowledge competency, experience, problem solving skill and authentic learning practice are identified to be the independent variables to develop problem solving competency in learning chemistry. Chemistry problem solving ability test and problem solving skills questionnaire are administered to 112 full reseidential school students. Result from the preliminary study found that low (20. 5 %) and average(53. 6 %) achiever in Chemistry problem solving ability test has verified the independent variables are essential for the research. Domains in the problem solving skills are also at the average and low level. This framework is being implemented in a research being undertaken at present. The research will be investigating the impact of module of the authentic learning practice on the chemistry problem-solving competency among full residential school students...|$|R

Sustainable humanitarian mind in this paper refers to individuals who have a high quality {{not only in terms of}} knowledge, skills, attitudes, personality and enthusiasm but also those who are highly concern and aware to keep the needs of future generations by considering the environmental protection. Education provided is not the end of the graduation process, but what is more important is their appreciation of the teaching and learning acquired. Change of mind to sustainable mindset not only through the process of teaching and learning in the classroom, but to include outdoor activities associated with our daily lives. This paper discusses the efforts conducted at Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia (UKM) level to implement UKM Lestari Program with the goal to achieve zero waste campus. Recycling program has more effective by working with Alam Flora Sdn. Bhd. The average percentage of recycling that are listed at 1. 62 %, gives an overview of the UKM community concerns related to the environment, is still at the low level. Students involvement in co-curricular activities of the environment and the activities of voluntary environmental are expected to be able to instill love for their <b>environment</b> <b>among</b> the <b>students</b> and the UKM community. The ability to generate sustainable humanitarian mind requires continuous, orderly, and comprehensive, involving all parties with a purpose and level of prosperity for all and future generations...|$|R

Doctor of Philosophy (Information Science), December 2013, 184 pp., 14 tables, 8 figures, references, 248 titles. In this multivariate correlational study, the researcher examined the course culture of an online graduate course whose environment exhibited characteristics of a Community of practice (CoP). An online survey captured data used to explore the relationships among variables shown to describe a CoP in field <b>environments</b> and <b>among</b> <b>student</b> perceptions of their experience in the course culture. A canonical correlation analysis (CCA) and commonality analysis (CA) were conducted using five predictor variables and three criterion variables to evaluate the degree and direction of the relationships. The CCA revealed that the full model was significant, explaining approximately 74 % of the variance among the two synthetic variates. Impact, faculty leadership, and connection were the largest contributors to the predictor variate. The criterion variate was primarily explained by value and perceived CoP, with exposure to the profession providing a smaller contribution. The CA confirmed these findings. Results from this study indicate that a CoP could be fostered in an online graduate course. The overall significance of the model indicates teachers can nurture an environment wherein graduate students will take the initiative to work with others to create and acquire knowledge that creates a sense of professional connection {{with each other and with}} the profession overall. The results of this study suggest furthe...|$|R
