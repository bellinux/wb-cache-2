5|$|The idea of {{locating}} Project Y at Oak Ridge was considered, {{but in the}} end it {{was decided}} that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a remote location. On Oppenheimer's recommendation, the search for a suitable site was narrowed to the vicinity of Albuquerque, New Mexico, where Oppenheimer owned a ranch. In October 1942, Major John H. Dudley of the Manhattan Project was sent to survey the area, and he recommended a site near Jemez Springs, New Mexico. On 16 November, Oppenheimer, Groves, Dudley and others toured the site. Oppenheimer feared that the high cliffs surrounding the site would make his people feel claustrophobic, while the engineers were concerned with the possibility of flooding. The party then moved on to the vicinity of the Los Alamos Ranch School. Oppenheimer was impressed and expressed a strong preference for the site, citing its natural beauty and views of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains, which, it was hoped, would inspire those who would work on the project. The engineers were concerned about the poor access road, and whether the water supply would be adequate, but otherwise felt that it was ideal.|$|E

25|$|During a {{discussion}} about the potential plot of the game's sequel BioShock 2, editor Hilary Goldstein said that Ryan should reappear in it, and that while <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a new area, it should still have connections to him. Onyett called Ryan a key element, and if not included in the sequel, there would be a dramatic loss of personality. He claimed that much of Rapture's personality comes from Ryan, and it would have much less of an impact without him. Editor Ryan Geddes agreed, adding that he felt there was more to Ryan than Rapture. Editor Nate Ahem suggested that the game's sequel, BioShock 2, could potentially put the players in the role of Ryan, to explore the story of trying to create a perfect world and having it crumble beneath their feet.|$|E
25|$|To {{choose the}} matrix for each solid analyte, three {{criteria}} must be considered. First, it should dissolve the solid compound to be analysed (with {{or without the}} aid of a cosolvent or additive), thus allowing molecules of that compound to diffuse to the surface layers, replenishing the sample molecules that have been ionized or destroyed by interaction with the fast atom beam. It {{should also be noted that}} another mechanism for explanation of ion formation in FAB involves the idea that sputtering occurs from the bulk rather than the surface, but in that case, the solubility is still largely important to insure homogeneity of solid analyte in the bulk solution. Secondly, the matrix should have a low volatility under the conditions of the mass spectrometer. As mentioned above, as the matrix is depleted, the ionization decreases as well, so maintaining the matrix is vital. Thirdly, the matrix should not react with the solid analyte in question, or if it does react, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> an understood and reproducible way. This ensures reproducibility of analysis and identification of the actual analyte rather than a derivative of the analyte.|$|E

[...] In his review, Wright explained his love of crossover fiction and commended Davies for the direction he took Doctor Who into becoming what Wright {{considered to be a}} [...] "small television industry". Wright complimented the way the episode was keeping with tradition, specifically aspects such as; [...] "Daleks trundling around spaceships having shouty conversations with each other"; [...] "UNIT [...] as useless as ever at repelling alien marauders", and the visual appearance of Davros. He described Bleach's portrayal as a [...] "halfway house between the original version as played by Michael Wisher and the more exuberant...turn by Terry Molloy". He also thought positively of the final scenes; he commented that [...] "the most flint-hearted must have had a misty eye as Rose found her Time Lord again and they ran towards each other in candy box slow-mo" [...] and he cheered when the [...] "outpouring of romance was brought to an end, as <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> Doctor Who, by a big Dalek gun".|$|E
2500|$|The gold {{standard}} diagnostic test for PMD is corneal topography.

Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune wrote: [...] "In Italy, it remains one of Fellini's most consistently loved movies. <b>It</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> America as well...

2500|$|The {{decision}} to shoot in Vancouver, {{where the first}} five years of The X-Files had been filmed and produced before the series had moved to Los Angeles, was an early idea; one that seemed right to both Chris Carter and David Duchovny.

[...] Filming in Vancouver also facilitated the return of many former crew members who had previously worked on The X-Files, as well as individuals who had worked on the other series that Ten Thirteen Productions had created. Frank Spotnitz said that [...] "In terms of making of the movie, we've brought together as many people as we can, not just from The X-Files but from all the shows that we did here in Vancouver – Harsh Realm, Millennium and The Lone Gunmen – and our crew is populated with all these faces that we'd worked with, over the past fifteen years.

2500|$|In Canada itself, the Oakes {{test has}} been {{comparable}} {{to the ways in}} which other rights have been limited. [...] Section Thirty-five of the Constitution Act, 1982, which affirms Aboriginal and treaty rights, is technically not part of the Charter and therefore is not subject to section 1. [...] However, in R. v. Sparrow the Court developed a test to limit section 35 that Hogg has compared to the section 1 Oakes test. [...] After the Sparrow case, provincial legislation can only limit Aboriginal rights if it has given them appropriate priority. [...] The Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms contains a section that has also been compared to section 1. [...] Namely, section 9.1 states that when one invokes rights, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> a manner with respecting [...] "democratic values, public order and the general well-being of the citizens of Québec" [...] and that law may limit rights. [...] In Ford v. Quebec, it was found an analysis of limits under section 9.1 should be similar to that under section 1 of the Canadian Charter. [...] In Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem, Justice Michel Bastarache contrasted this with the main difference between the two sections. [...] Namely, the section 9.1 statements about how one should use rights does not mention legislatures, and thus the Quebec Charter has relevance to private law. [...] In Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp. (1994), the Court also developed a test under the common law modelled after the Oakes test to consider publication bans.|$|E
