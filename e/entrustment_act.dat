40|$|BACKGROUND: About 150 - 200 'Placement in an Institution for Juveniles Orders' (PIJ orders) {{are imposed}} {{each year in}} the Netherlands. Many of the young people under these orders have mental {{disorders}} or 'threatened psychological development' and are thought to be at high risk of recidivism. There are no previous studies of the range of judicial, correctional or psychiatric contacts after the PIJ order, but this could extend understanding of any links between post-treatment psychological development of these young offenders and their reoffending or desistence from it. AIMS: To examine reoffending and judicial, correctional or psychiatric contacts of juveniles after a PIJ order, any relationship between seriousness of the index offence and first reoffence, and to test the hypothesis that 'threatened psychological development' is associated with higher recidivism rates. METHODS: A records-based follow-up study of a 9 -year (1995 - 2003) national release cohort of 781 Dutch juvenile offenders finishing a PIJ order under the Juvenile <b>Entrustment</b> <b>Act.</b> Descriptive statistics were used to show patterns of reoffending and the reoffending and non-reoffending groups compared. RESULTS: The mean length of the PIJ order was 2. 5 years, and mean time subsequently at risk for offending was 83. 5 months (range 51 - 135 months). After treatment under a PIJ order, serious criminal offending was reduced by 50 %, and there was a trend towards less serious property offences. Contrary to prediction, 'threatened psychological development' was not associated with worse outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: The data offer support for the value of the PIJ order. The recidivism rate remains high, and although the trend to less serious offending is encouraging, the findings raise questions about whether criminogenic needs are sufficiently met. By contrast, the apparently low rates of adult mental disorder, even among those regarded as having had 'threatened psychological development', suggest that PIJ institutions are doing a good job with respect to mental health...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Several {{studies have}} shown that adults who develop {{schizophrenia}} and commit a criminal offence may already have shown behaviour problems in childhood or adolescence. It is less clear whether such problems follow a particular pattern in such patients. AIMS: To examine the utility of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) among offenders, to test whether externalizing behaviour problems, as measured by the CBCL, are more frequent in psychotic offenders than in non-offenders with psychosis, and to investigate relationships between early behavioural problems and adult personality disorder in psychotic offenders. METHODS: Three groups of violent offenders detained under the Dutch <b>Entrustment</b> <b>Act</b> (TBS-detainees) (n = 78) and one group of psychotic patients in general psychiatry (n = 16) were rated from case records on the CBCL. RESULTS: There was a significant difference between psychotic offenders with a personality disorder (n = 25) and the non-offender patients with psychosis (n = 16) on the 'delinquent behavior' scale, but no such difference between psychotic offenders with (n = 25) and without (n = 21) personality disorder. A hierarchic cluster analysis revealed significantly higher scores for externalizing behaviour in all TBS-detainees with a personality disorder. Those starting to offend early had higher scores for externalizing behaviour than late starters. CONCLUSIONS: Psychotic and non-psychotic offenders with personality disorder resemble one another in their early childhood behaviour problems; psychotic offenders without a personality disorder differ from these two groups but resemble non-offenders with psychosis. In contrast to findings in non-forensic populations, there were no differences on other problem scales of the CBCL. Given the small sample sizes, replication is needed, but the findings lend weight to treatment models which focus on the psychosis in the latter two groups but extend also to personality disorder in the former...|$|E
5000|$|The European Commission {{has stated}} [...] that an [...] "act of entrustment" [...] is {{necessary}} in order to set out the public service obligations of the undertaking and must have been committed to the organisation through an official act having legal force under the national law of the relevant EU member state. There need not be any specific legal framework covering <b>acts</b> of <b>entrustment,</b> but the <b>act</b> must extend sufficiently to create an obligation or accountability: permission, such as legal recognition or regulatory approval would not be sufficient. The obligation may be set out in legislation, the terms of a contract or in certain cases in a grant agreement. The <b>act</b> of <b>entrustment</b> should, in particular, state the nature, territorial scope and duration of the public service obligations, the organisation concerned, and the nature of any exclusive or special rights which the organisation may be able to exercise, along with the mechanism for calculating the level of compensation.|$|R
