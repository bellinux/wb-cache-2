50|$|Unlike his predecessor, when Theodore Roosevelt {{took his}} {{oath of office}} in 1905, he found the {{previous}} presidential medal unacceptable. As an art lover and admirer of the ancient Greek high-relief coins, Roosevelt wanted {{more than a simple}} medal—he wanted a work of art. To achieve this goal, the president hired Augustus Saint-Gaudens, a famous American sculptor, to design and create his inauguration medal. Saint-Gaudens's obsession with perfection resulted in a forestalled release and the medals were distributed after the actual inauguration. Nonetheless, President Roosevelt was very pleased with the result. Saint Gardens' design, executed by Adolph A. Weinman, was cast by Tiffany & Company and was proclaimed an artistic triumph. Saint-Gaudens' practice of creating a portrait sculpture of the newly elected president is still used today in presidential medal creation. After the president sits for the sculptor, the resulting clay sketch is turned into a life mask and plaster model. Finishing touches are added and the epoxy cast that is created is used to produce the <b>die</b> <b>cuts.</b> The <b>die</b> <b>cuts</b> are then used to strike the president's portrait on each medal.|$|R
