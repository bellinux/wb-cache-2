5|$|The {{numbers of}} cephalopod, <b>echinoderm,</b> and bivalve genera {{exhibited}} significant diminution after the K–Pg boundary. Most species of brachiopods, a small phylum of marine invertebrates, survived the K–Pg extinction event and diversified {{during the early}} Paleocene.|$|E
5|$|Approximately 35% of <b>echinoderm</b> genera became extinct at the K–Pg boundary, {{although}} taxa that {{thrived in}} low-latitude, shallow-water environments {{during the late}} Cretaceous had the highest extinction rate. Mid-latitude, deep-water echinoderms were much less affected at the K–Pg boundary. The pattern of extinction points to habitat loss, specifically the drowning of carbonate platforms, the shallow-water reefs in existence at that time, by the extinction event.|$|E
50|$|The Eocrinoidea are an extinct {{class of}} <b>echinoderms</b> that lived between the Early Cambrian and Late Silurian periods. They are the {{earliest}} known group of stalked, arm-bearing <b>echinoderms,</b> and were the most common <b>echinoderms</b> during the Cambrian.|$|R

5|$|Starfish {{sometimes}} have {{negative effects on}} ecosystems. Outbreaks of crown-of-thorns starfish have caused damage to coral reefs in Northeast Australia and French Polynesia. A study in Polynesia found that coral cover declined drastically {{with the arrival of}} migratory starfish in 2006, dropping from 50% to under 5% in three years. This had an unintended effect on reef-feeding fish and the whole benthic community. Asterias amurensis is one of a few <b>echinoderm</b> invasive species. Its larvae likely arrived in Tasmania from central Japan via water discharged from ships in the 1980s. The species has since grown in numbers {{to the point where they}} threaten commercially important bivalve populations. As such, they are considered pests, and are on the Invasive Species Specialist Group's list of the world's 100 worst invasive species.|$|E
25|$|Many urchins in the Toxopneustidae are venomous as well, but {{the danger}} {{does not come}} from their spines (short and blunt) but from their pedicellariae, like the {{collector}} urchin and especially the flower urchin, the only potentially lethal <b>echinoderm</b> known to date.|$|E
25|$|Radially {{symmetrical}} organisms {{include those}} in the group Radiata primarily jellyfish, sea anemones and corals and the comb jellies. Adult echinoderms, such as starfish, sea urchins, sea cucumbers and others are also included, since they are pentaradial, meaning they have five discrete rotational symmetry. <b>Echinoderm</b> larvae are not included, since they are bilaterally symmetrical. Radially symmetrical organisms always have one distinctive axis.|$|E
40|$|The pentaradial {{organisation}} of <b>echinoderms</b> is postulated to {{have evolved}} {{as the result}} of the reorganisation of the internal U-shaped mesentery of the intestinal tract during inflation of the trunk of a pterobranch-like ancestor. Under this scenario, loops of the mesentery developed between five hydraulic bulges by three different mechanisms: (1) by the early formation of two additional loops resulting directly in five hydraulic bulges, (2) by the subsequent formation of two additional loops resulting in the formation of initially three and then five hydraulic bulges or (3) by the inflation of the body without formation of loops. Accordingly there are at least three main evolutionary pathways within the <b>echinoderms.</b> The anatomical structures, such as the ambulacral system or the skeletal capsule, which characterize the <b>echinoderms,</b> developed independently in both lineages. From all the three pathways various body structures can be derived matching those found in fossil and extant <b>echinoderms.</b> The eleutherozoans and the earliest pentaradial <b>echinoderms</b> most likely evolved from the direct-pentaradial pathway whereas triradiate <b>echinoderms</b> and those which show a pentaradial organisation superimposed on triradial symmetry, likely evolved along the indirect pathway. The asymmetric or bilateral symmetric <b>echinoderms</b> evolved from the third paythway. The most important morphological transformations leading to the directly and indirectly pentaradial <b>echinoderms</b> are discussed and described. Comment: 10 pages, 5 figure...|$|R

25|$|MTs {{are present}} in a vast range of taxonomic groups, ranging from prokaryotes (such as the {{cyanobacteria}} Synechococcus sp.), protozoa (such as the ciliate Tetrahymena genera), plants (such as Pisum sativum, Triticum durum, Zea mays, or Quercus suber), yeast (such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Candida albicans), invertebrates (such as the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the insect Drosophila melanogaster, the mollusc Mytilus edulis, or the <b>echinoderm</b> Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) and vertebrates (such as the chicken Gallus gallus, or the mammalian Homo sapiens or Mus musculus).|$|E
25|$|Tertiary {{structure}} of MTs is also highly heterogeneous. While vertebrate, <b>echinoderm</b> and crustacean MTs show a bidominial structure with divalent metals as Zn(II) or Cd(II) (the protein is folded {{so as to}} bind metals in two functionally independent domains, with a metallic cluster each), yeast and procariotyc MTs show a monodominial structure (one domain with a single metallic cluster). Although no structural data is available for molluscan, nematoda and Drosophila MTs, it is commonly assumed that the former are bidominial and the latter monodominial. No conclusive data are available for Plant MTs, but two possible structures have been proposed: 1) a bidominial structure {{similar to that of}} vertebrate MTs; 2) a codominial structure, in which two Cys-rich domains interact to form a single metallic cluster.|$|E

40|$|Weda Bay {{located at}} Halmahera Island, North Maluku was rich in fishes, sea cucumbers, crabs, shrimp, and alge resources. Research on {{diversity}} and density of <b>echinoderms</b> at Weda Bay, North Maluku was limited {{and therefore it}} was lack on data and information of the biota. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the diversity and density of <b>echinoderms</b> at Weda Bay, North Maluku. This research was conducted in March 2013 including transects and free collection of 6 stations contained <b>echinoderms.</b> The results showed that the overall <b>echinoderms</b> were found 23 species of 17 generas, 12 families, 10 orders, and 5 classes.

50|$|The <b>echinoderms</b> are {{important}} both biologically and geologically. Biologically, {{there are few}} other groupings so abundant in the biotic desert of the deep sea, as well as shallower oceans. Most <b>echinoderms</b> are able to regenerate tissue, organs, limbs, and reproduce asexually; in some cases, they can undergo complete regeneration from a single limb. Geologically, the value of <b>echinoderms</b> is in their ossified skeletons, which are major contributors to many limestone formations, and can provide valuable clues as to the geological environment. They were the most used species in regenerative research in the 19th and 20th centuries. Further, it is held by some scientists that the radiation of <b>echinoderms</b> {{was responsible for the}} Mesozoic Marine Revolution.|$|R
50|$|The first universally {{accepted}} <b>echinoderms</b> {{appear in the}} Lower Cambrian period, asterozoans appeared in the Ordovician and the crinoids were a dominant group in the Paleozoic. <b>Echinoderms</b> left behind an extensive fossil record. It is hypothesised that the ancestor of all <b>echinoderms</b> was a simple, motile, bilaterally symmetrical animal with a mouth, gut and anus. This ancestral stock adopted an attached mode of life and suspension feeding, and developed radial symmetry as this was more advantageous for such an existence. The larvae of all <b>echinoderms</b> are even now bilaterally symmetrical and all develop radial symmetry at metamorphosis. The starfish and crinoids still attach themselves to the seabed while changing to their adult form.|$|R
2500|$|Animals {{are divided}} by body plan into {{vertebrates}} and invertebrates. Vertebrates—fishes, amphibians, reptiles, birds, and mammals—have a [...] vertebral column (spine); invertebrates do not. [...] All vertebrates and most invertebrates are bilaterally symmetrical (Bilateria). These invertebrates include arthropods, molluscs, roundworms, ringed worms, flatworms, and other phyla in Ecdysozoa and Spiralia. <b>Echinoderm</b> larvae are initially bilaterally symmetrical, but later as adults develop radial symmetry; Cnidarians are radially symmetrical; ctenophores are biradially symmetrical; and sponges have no symmetry.|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of neural control of relaxation in vertebrate smooth muscle are well characterised, {{and a variety}} of neural-derived relaxants have been identified, including neuropeptides and nitric oxide (NO) (Boeckxstaens and Pelckmans, 1997). <b>Echinoderms</b> are of particular interest with respect to vertebrate muscle physiology because, like the vertebrates, they have a deuterostomian mode of development. Accordingly, along with a few other invertebrate phyla, the <b>echinoderms</b> are recognised as sharing a more recent common ancestor (deuterostomian) with vertebrates than with the protostomian invertebrate phyla. Therefore, the physiology of muscle in <b>echinoderms</b> may {{have more in common with}} that of vertebrates than with the muscle systems of, for example, arthropodan invertebrates.

60|$|The hardly less startling {{hypothesis}} that the Echinoderms are coalesced worms, on the other hand, appears {{to be open to}} serious objection. As a matter of anatomy, {{it does not seem to}} me to correspond with fact; for there is no worm with a calcareous skeleton, nor any which has a band-like ventral nerve, superficial to which lies an ambulacral vessel. And, as a question of development, the formation of the radiate <b>Echinoderm</b> within its vermiform larva seems to me to be analogous to the formation of a radiate Medusa upon a Hydrozoic stock. But a Medusa is surely not the result of the coalescence of as many organisms as it presents morphological segments.|$|E
60|$|As {{regards the}} second problem offered to us by Redi, whether Xenogenesis obtains, {{side by side with}} Homogenesis,--whether, that is, there exist not only the {{ordinary}} living things, giving rise to offspring which run through the same cycle as themselves, but also others, producing offspring which are of a totally different character from themselves,-- the researches of two centuries have led to a different result. That the grubs found in galls are no product of the plants on which the galls grow, but are the result of the introduction of the eggs of insects into the substance of these plants, was made out by Vallisnieri, Réaumur, and others, {{before the end of the}} first half of the eighteenth century. The tapeworms, bladderworms, and flukes continued to be a stronghold of the advocates of Xenogenesis for a much longer period. Indeed, it is only within the last thirty years that the splendid patience of Von Siebold, Van Beneden, Leuckart, Küchenmeister, and other helminthologists, has succeeded in tracing every such parasite, often through the strangest wanderings and metamorphoses, to an egg derived from a parent, actually or potentially like itself; and the tendency of inquiries elsewhere has all been in the same direction. A plant may throw off bulbs, but these, sooner or later, give rise to seeds or spores, which develop into the original form. A polype may give rise to Medusae, or a pluteus to an <b>Echinoderm,</b> but the Medusa and the <b>Echinoderm</b> give rise to eggs which produce polypes or glutei, and they are therefore only stages in the cycle of life of the species.|$|E

60|$|With such {{structures}} as {{the above}} lamellae of horn or whalebone, habit or use can {{have done little}} or nothing, {{as far as we}} can judge, towards their development. On the other hand, the transportal of the lower eye of a flat-fish to the upper side of the head, and the formation of a prehensile tail, may be attributed almost wholly to continued use, together with inheritance. With respect to the mammae of the higher animals, the most probable conjecture is that primordially the cutaneous glands over the whole surface of a marsupial sack secreted a nutritious fluid; and that these glands were improved in function through natural selection, and concentrated into a confined area, in which case they would have formed a mamma. There is no more difficulty in understanding how the branched spines of some ancient <b>Echinoderm,</b> which served as a defence, became developed through natural selection into tridactyle pedicellariae, than in understanding the development of the pincers of crustaceans, through slight, serviceable modifications in the ultimate and penultimate segments of a limb, which was at first used solely for locomotion. In the avicularia and vibracula of the Polyzoa we have organs widely different in appearance developed from the same source; and with the vibracula we can understand how the successive gradations might have been of service. With the pollinia of orchids, the threads which originally served to tie together the pollen-grains, can be traced cohering into caudicles; and the steps can likewise be followed by which viscid matter, such as that secreted by the stigmas of ordinary flowers, and still subserving nearly but not quite the same purpose, became attached to the free ends of the caudicles--all these gradations being of manifest benefit to the plants in question.
