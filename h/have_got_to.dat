(Chuck) Foreman... it'll be fourth down. (Matt) Cavanaugh will let it run down for one final attempt, he'll let the seconds tick off to give Miami no opportunity whatsoever. (Whistle blows.) Timeout is called with three seconds remaining, John Smith is on the line. And I don't care what's on the line, Howard, you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> say what we know in the booth.Cosell: Yes, {{we have to say}} it. Remember this is just a football game, no matter who wins or loses. An unspeakable tragedy confirmed to us by ABC News in New York City: John Lennon, outside of his apartment building on the West Side of New York City, the most famous perhaps, of all of the Beatles, shot twice in the back, rushed to Roosevelt Hospital, dead on arrival. Hard {{to go back to the}} game after that newsflash, which, in duty bound, we have to take. Frank?Gifford: (after a pause) Indeed, it is.|$|E

500|$|Bamber {{was tried}} in October 1986 before Maurice Drake and a jury at Chelmsford Crown Court, during a trial that lasted 19 days. The {{prosecution}} {{was led by}} Anthony Arlidge QC, and the defence by Geoffrey Rivlin QC, supported by Ed Lawson QC. The Times wrote that Bamber cut an arrogant figure in the witness box. At one point when prosecutors accused him of lying, he replied: [...] "That is what you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> establish." ...|$|E

He said, [...] "We {{will not}} allow people to separate us from the United States of America {{in dealing with the}} common challenges that we face around the world. I think people <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> remember that the relationship between Britain and America and between a British prime minister and an American president is built on the things that we share, the same enduring values about the importance of liberty, opportunity, the dignity of the individual.

500|$|In {{a speech}} in July 2007, Brown {{clarified}} his position regarding Britain's relationship with the USA [...] "We will not allow people to separate us from the United States of America {{in dealing with the}} common challenges that we face around the world.

500|$|Despite the two losses, {{the tour}} was a triumph for Armstrong. Personally, he {{achieved}} the 1,000runs and 100wickets milestone {{for the third}} time in an English summer. [...] About his captaincy, former rival Frank Foster said, [...] "I honestly think that Australia <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> thank one man, one man only for their success. [...] That man is Warwick Armstrong, probably one of the best captains ever sent to England from Australia". On return to Australia, Armstrong was greeted by large enthusiastic crowds and acclaimed at many public receptions. [...] At one reception, he was presented with a ₤2,500 cheque by the Prime Minister of Australia Billy Hughes.|$|E

500|$|In the 1964U.S. presidential election, Senator Barry Goldwater {{quickly became}} the likely Republican Party nominee. Goldwater {{represented}} {{a new wave of}} American conservatism, of which the moderate Romney was not a part. Romney also felt that Goldwater would be a drag on Republicans running in all the other races that year, including Romney's own (at the time, Michigan had two-year terms for its governor). Finally, Romney disagreed strongly with Goldwater's views on civil rights; he would later say, [...] "Whites and Negroes, in my opinion, <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> learn to know each other. Barry Goldwater didn't have any background to understand this, to fathom them, and I couldn't get through to him." ...|$|E
500|$|I often {{experience}} combat as {{it should}} be. I see myself {{in the middle of}} a British [...] swarm, firing from every position and never getting caught. Our aircraft are basic elements, Stahlschmidt, which <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> be mastered. You've got to be able to shoot from any position. From left or right turns, out of a roll, on your back, whenever. Only this way can you develop your own particular tactics. Attack tactics, that the enemy simply cannot anticipate during the course of the battle – a series of unpredictable movements and actions, never the same, always stemming from the situation at hand. Only then can you plunge into the middle of an enemy swarm and blow it up from the inside.|$|E
500|$|On August 31, Tancredo shifted {{momentarily}} {{to a new}} issue. On {{the two-year}} anniversary of the landfall of Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans, he called for funds to be withdrawn and federal aid be cut off for the recovery effort. He remarked that it was time, [...] "the taxpayer gravy train left the New Orleans station." [...] The move was perhaps a step for the candidate to woo fiscal conservatives and advocates for states' rights, commenting that [...] "at some point, {{state and local officials}} and individuals <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> {{step up to the plate}} and take some initiative, the mentality that people can wait around indefinitely for the federal taxpayer to solve all their worldly problems has got to come to an end." ...|$|E

500|$|Hand was {{increasingly}} {{called upon to}} judge cases arising from the flood of New Deal legislation. The line between central government authority and local legislation particularly tested his powers of judgment. In 1935, the case of United States v. Schechter came before the Second Circuit. Hand and his two colleagues had to judge whether a New York poultry firm had contravened New Deal legislation on unfair trade practices. They ruled that the National Industrial Recovery Act {{did not apply to}} the Schechter Poultry Corporation, which traded solely within the state. [...] "The line is no doubt in the end arbitrary," [...] Hand wrote in a memorandum, [...] "but we <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> draw it, because without it Congress can take over all the government." [...] The Supreme Court later affirmed Hand's decision.|$|E
500|$|He {{formed an}} {{effective}} partnership with fellow winger Ryan Fraser as Bournemouth enjoyed their best start to {{a season in}} the second tier in 2013–14. In mid-November 2013 Pugh stated his belief that Bournemouth had made a [...] "decent start" [...] to the season; by this point he had scored 4 goals from 16 appearances. He believed his playing intelligence improved by playing against more attack-minded full backs in the Championship, saying that [...] "They are still quick to react and you <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> use your brain {{a little bit more}} than in League One. It's developed me as a player because you need to learn how to perform in different situations against different players". Pugh made 45 appearances and scored 5 goals in 2013–14 as Bournemouth finished in 10th place in the Championship, which at the time was the highest league ranking in the club's history.|$|E
500|$|Back in London, Fleming had his manuscript—which he {{described}} as his [...] "dreadful oafish opus"—retyped by Joan Howe, his red-haired secretary at The Times on whom the character Miss Moneypenny was partly based. Clare Blanchard, a former girlfriend, advised him not to publish the book, {{or at least to}} do so under a pseudonym. During the book's final draft stages, Fleming allowed his friend, and later editor, William Plomer to see a copy, and remarked [...] "I really am thoroughly ashamed of it... after rifling through this muck you will probably never speak to me again, but I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> take that chance." [...] Despite this, Plomer thought the book had sufficient promise and sent a copy to the publishing house Jonathan Cape. At first they were unenthusiastic, but were persuaded to publish on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother, Peter, an established travel writer whose books they managed.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} day the division improved its position. Strong point [...] "Lion", {{to the south}} west of [...] "Tiger", was captured, but an attempt to capture the remaining sections of [...] "Tugun" [...] was repelled. As {{a result of the}} fighting, the division began to face a shortage of ammunition for its artillery. Due to the tank battle raging to the south, Scobie was ordered not to make a further advance. The author of the Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War 1939–45, W. E. Murphy, highlights that the fighting by the British armour and 70th Division had created much [...] "confusion in the enemy camp" [...] and that, had the 32nd Army Tank Brigade attempted, it [...] "could certainly <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> Ed Duda" [...] and in doing so would have thwarted the German plans, greatly aiding the beleaguered 7th Armoured Division.|$|E
500|$|Given the UFA's formal {{adoption}} of the goal of replacing Stewart's Liberal government with a Farmer government, it remained surprisingly friendly towards the Premier. While campaigning for Moore during the Cochrane by-election, Wood called Stewart [...] "an honourable, upright citizen, doing {{the best he could}} under difficult circumstances" [...] and boasted that [...] "if I <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> tear down the character of an honourable man to build up something that I want, I am not going to build it up." [...] When at last the general election came, in 1921, the UFA declined to run a candidate in Stewart's Sedgewick riding as a sign of respect to the Premier. After the UFA swept to victory, there was even speculation that Stewart, still a UFA member, would stay on as Premier of a new Farmer's government (as part of its opposition to [...] "old style politics," [...] the UFA had contested the election without designating a leader), but he announced otherwise.|$|E
500|$|In 2012, Madonna {{released}} her twelfth studio album, MDNA. The lead single, [...] "Give Me All Your Luvin'", and subsequent releases from the album were not {{added to the}} Radio 1 playlist, despite the former featuring rappers Nicki Minaj and M.I.A., two artists who receive regular rotation on the station. Radio 1 DJ Scott Mills defended their decision not to play Madonna saying, [...] "I don't think we play Madonna any more. There {{is a lot of}} research, and if you ask a 17-year-old about her, they go 'don't care' [...] it's a sign of the times, things change, it's a generational thing. I like Madonna, does a 17-year-old? [...] probably not {{at the top of their}} list. And that's horrible, but that is the way it is [...] and also youth audiences are so fickle in what they like and what they don't like, and they're quite opinionated, you just <b>have</b> <b>got</b> <b>to</b> keep on top of that." ...|$|E
