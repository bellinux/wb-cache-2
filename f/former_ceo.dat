40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] [1] NEW CLASSIFICATIONS FOR CHAIRMEN OF THE BOARD [...] I DID IT MY WAY. In {{this paper}} I {{determine}} whether a new classification of chairmen (<b>former</b> <b>CEOs)</b> should {{be added to the}} traditional current CEO and independent categories. I examine the impact the three categories of chairmen have on firm performance and whether CEO compensation differs between the three categories. If firms with chairmen who are <b>former</b> <b>CEOs</b> have significantly different firm performance or CEO compensation than the other two groups, a third category of chairmen (<b>former</b> <b>CEOs)</b> should be used in future research. The findings shed light on the value of having <b>former</b> <b>CEOs</b> control the board, and should influence the results of studies using chairmen as a control variable. I find that chairmen who are <b>former</b> <b>CEOs</b> are significantly different than current CEOs and independent chairman, and should be separated into their own category. Firms with chairmen who are <b>former</b> <b>CEOs</b> have highest firm performance. These firms also pay less in CEO compensation than firms with current CEOs/chairmen but more than firms with independent chairmen. [2] A TEMP IN THE CORNER OFFICE : THE IMPACT OF INTERIM CEOS ON FIRM PERFORMANCE. This paper examines the impact an interim CEO's previous experience and tenure length have on accounting- and market-based firm performance. I also examine the number of significant changes an interim CEO makes to the firm and the impact of those changes. I find that the prior experience an interim CEO has does not {{have a significant impact on}} firm performance. Interim CEOs are significantly less likely to make major changes to the firm than their predecessors; however, some of the changes they make have a significant impact on firm performance...|$|R

5|$|In 1983, Nolan Bushnell {{founded a}} new computer-guided {{animation}} studio called Kadabrascope as {{a subsidiary of}} his Chuck E.

After the North American Video Game Crash of 1983, Bushnell started selling some subsidiaries of PTT to keep the business afloat. Sente Technologies (another division, was founded to have games distributed in PTT stores) would be sold to Bally Games and Kadabrascope would be sold to LucasFilm. The Kadabrascope assets would be combined with the Computer Division of LucasFilm.

5|$|Survivalism and {{disaster}} preparation are prevalent {{themes in the}} novel. Several interviews, especially those from the United States, focus on policy changes designed to train the surviving U.S. population to fight the zombies and rebuild the country.

He also pointed out that the U.S. likes the zombie genre because it believes that it can survive anything with the right tools and talent.|$|E
5|$|Much {{support has}} been {{achieved}} by talk radio personality Neal Boortz. Boortz's book (co-authored by Georgia Congressman John Linder) entitled The FairTax Book, explains the proposal and spent time atop the New York Times Best Seller list. Boortz stated that he donates {{his share of the}} proceeds to charity to promote the book. In addition, Boortz and Linder have organized several FairTax rallies to publicize support for the plan. Other media personalities have also assisted in growing grassroots support including former radio and TV talk show host Larry Elder, radio host and former candidate for the 2012 GOP Presidential Nomination Herman Cain, Fox News and radio host Sean Hannity, and Fox Business Host John Stossel. The FairTax received additional visibility as one of the issues in the 2008 presidential election. At a debate on June 30, 2007, several Republican candidates were asked about their position on the FairTax and many responded that they would sign the bill into law if elected. The most vocal promoters of the FairTax during the 2008 primary elections were Republican candidate Mike Huckabee and Democratic candidate Mike Gravel. The Internet, blogosphere, and electronic mailing lists have contributed to promoting, organizing, and gaining support for the FairTax. In the 2012 Republican presidential primary, and his ensuing Libertarian Party presidential run, former Governor of New Mexico and businessman Gary Johnson actively campaigned for the FairTax. <b>Former</b> <b>CEO</b> of Godfather's Pizza Herman Cain has been promoting the FairTax as a final step in a multiple-phase tax reform. Outside of the United States, the Christian Heritage Party of Canada adopted a FairTax proposal as part of their 2011 election platform but won no seats in that election.|$|E
