5|$|Incorporation into The Grand Duchy of Lithuania {{resulted}} <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>economic,</b> {{political and}} ethno-cultural unification of Belarusian lands. Of the principalities {{held by the}} Duchy, nine of them were settled by a population that would eventually become Belarusian people. During this time, the Duchy was involved in several military campaigns, including fighting {{on the side of}} Poland against the Teutonic Knights at the Battle of Grunwald in 1410; the joint victory allowed the Duchy to control the northwestern borderlands of Eastern Europe.|$|E
5|$|The {{aquaculture}} {{potential for}} sand whiting was first investigated {{in the late}} 1980s, {{with a number of}} reports detailing both successful trials and also a number of problems with such trials. A 1988 study showed that sand whiting were more likely to grow in captivity than other whiting species, but the mortality rate of over 50% was unacceptable for use <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> setting. A number of problems with diseases such as ulcerative dermatitis and the failure of the swim-bladder to inflate properly were also documented, however many of these initial problems have been overcome, and some facilities are breeding around 2000 larvae with a 95% survival rate. Some of these fingerlings are used to restock depleted estuaries, while others form the basis of commercial fish crops.|$|E
5|$|The {{assets of}} Icelandic pension funds are, {{according}} to one expert, expected to shrink by 15–25%. The Icelandic Pension Funds Association has announced that benefits will in all likelihood have to be cut in 2009. Iceland's GDP is expected by economists to shrink {{by as much as}} 10% {{as a result of the}} crisis, putting Iceland by some measures <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> depression. Inflation may climb as high as 75% by the end of the year.|$|E

5|$|The {{idea behind}} the episode came from the {{financial}} crisis of Northern Rock in late 2007; the producers wanted {{to set up a}} story about a bank collapse so severe it could result <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> collapse. The episode was filmed in May 2008, with a lot taking place in London's Blue Fin building. About six million viewers saw the episode from both BBC One and Three broadcasts; the BBC One ratings were steady despite heavy competition from I'm a Celebrity, Get Me Out of Here! on ITV1. Critical reactions towards the episode were positive for including a change in plot.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1974, Australia was <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> slump, {{suffering}} from the 1973 oil crisis and 1973–75 recession. The 1973 oil crisis had caused prices to spike and, according to government figures, inflation topped 13percent {{for over a year}} between 1973 and 1974. Part of the inflation was due to Whitlam's desire to increase wages and conditions of the Commonwealth Public Service as a pacesetter for the private sector. The Whitlam government had cut tariffs by 25percent in 1973; 1974 saw an increase in imports of 30percent and a $1.5billion increase in the trade deficit. Primary producers of commodities such as beef were caught in a credit squeeze as short-term rates rose to extremely high levels. Unemployment also rose significantly. Unease within the ALP led to Barnard's defeat when Jim Cairns challenged him for his deputy leadership. Whitlam gave little help to his embattled deputy, who had formed {{the other half of the}} duumvirate.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, Gaddafi was overjoyed by the {{foundation}} of the Arab Maghreb Union, uniting Libya <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> pact with Mauritania, Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, viewing it as beginnings of a new Pan-Arab union. Meanwhile, Libya stepped up its support for anti-Western militants such as the Provisional IRA, and in 1988, Pan Am Flight 103 was blown up over Lockerbie in Scotland, killing 243 passengers and 16 crew members, plus 11 people on the ground. British police investigations identified two Libyans – Abdelbaset al-Megrahi and Lamin Khalifah Fhimah – as the chief suspects, and in November 1991 issued a declaration demanding that Libya hand them over. When Gaddafi refused, citing the Montreal Convention, the United Nations (UN) imposed Resolution 748 in March 1992, initiating economic sanctions against Libya which had deep repercussions for the country's economy. The country suffered an estimated $900 million financial loss as a result. Further problems arose with the West when in January 1989, two Libyan warplanes were shot down by the U.S. off the Libyan coast. Many African states opposed the UN sanctions, with Mandela criticizing them on a visit to Gaddafi in October 1997, when he praised Libya for its work in fighting apartheid and awarded Gaddafi the Order of Good Hope. They would only be suspended in 1998 when Libya agreed to allow the extradition of the suspects to the Scottish Court in the Netherlands, in a process overseen by Mandela.|$|E

5|$|The first {{shipment}} of coins, $130,000 in half dollars, arrived by ship on December 9, 1883. Hawaii was still <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> recession. A {{number of members}} of the business community, including Sanford B. Dole, objected to the issue on the grounds that so much silver would inflate the currency, and went to court to prevent the government from giving Spreckels bonds in exchange for anything except gold coin, as the law required. The government opposed the action, which was brought in the islands' supreme court, {{on the grounds that the}} silver coins were equivalent to gold. The chief justice, A. F. Judd, granted a temporary writ of mandamus against the government giving the Dole plaintiffs what they wanted, finding that the coins were not equivalent to gold, and that the coinage and loan acts had been violated. On appeal to the full court, though, Judd was reversed, as the court found that Dole and his associates should have filed for an injunction. But when they did, the petition was denied. In the interim at a meeting chaired by the king, the privy council had declared the new coinage a legal tender; once the lawsuit was resolved, the government paid for a half million dollars in coins with a like amount of bonds.|$|E
5|$|This {{allowed the}} Western provinces to {{flourish}} <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>economic</b> revival {{that had begun}} {{in the time of}} his grandfather Alexios I and continued till the close of the century. Indeed, {{it has been argued that}} Byzantium in the 12th century was richer and more prosperous than at any time since the Persian invasion during the reign of Herakleios, some five hundred years earlier. There is good evidence from this period of new construction and new churches, even in remote areas, strongly suggesting that wealth was widespread. Trade was also flourishing; it has been estimated that the population of Constantinople, the biggest commercial center of the Empire, was between half a million and one million during Manuel's reign, making it by far the largest city in Europe. A major source of Manuel's wealth was the kommerkion, a customs duty levied at Constantinople on all imports and exports. The kommerkion was stated to have collected 20,000 hyperpyra each day.|$|E

25|$|A {{particularly}} important objective, called computational thermochemistry, is to calculate thermochemical quantities {{such as the}} enthalpy of formation to chemical accuracy.
