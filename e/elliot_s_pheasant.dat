5000|$|Perhaps {{the white}} wing-band was already present by that time; as the copper {{pheasant}} has a highly apomorphic coloration with reduced sexual dimorphism, {{it may well}} have lost such a trait after it settled Japan. But it might also have evolved only after the copper pheasant ancestors had split {{from those of the}} species displaying the wing-band today. However that may be, the minor plumage differences of the wing-banded species suggest that their last common ancestor looked almost identical to the living Mrs. Hume's <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> humiae). At some point during the Pliocene [...] - [...] probably around 2.8 mya during the Piacenzian [...] - [...] the ancestors of the Mikado <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> mikado) settled Taiwan, apparently during the period when that island separated from the mainland and alternated between being a peninsula and an island for some time. They were finally isolated no later than the Late Pliocene; the species is melanistic, suggesting a small founder population. The adjacent mainland population split into the subtropical and partially leucistic <b>Elliot's</b> <b>pheasant</b> (<b>S.</b> ellioti) and the tropical Mrs. Hume's pheasant only in the Middle Pleistocene, around half a million years ago. This divergence was probably in some way connected to climate changes at the Günz-Mindel interglacial to Mindel boundary, when mountains in the region became dry and at times icebound. The Nanling Mountains region marks the present-day boundary between these sister species and is not inhabited by either.|$|R
